AN ACT for the purpose of securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit of publishing their literary productions, for twenty-one years.
Whereas the improvement of knowledge, the progress of civilization, the public weal of the community, and the advancement of human happiness, greatly depend on the efforts of learned and ingenious persons in the various arts and sciences:
As the principal encouragement such persons can have to make great and beneficial exertions of this nature, must exist in the legal security of the fruits of their study and industry to themselves; as such security is one of the natural rights of all men, there being no property more peculiarly a man's own than that which is produced by the labour of his mind:
Therefore, to encourage learned and ingenious persons to write useful books for the benefit of mankind: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all books, treatises, and other literary works, having the name or names of the author or authors thereof printed and published with the same, shall be the sole property of the said author or authors, being subjects of the United States of America, their heirs and assigns, for the full and compleat term of twenty-one years, from the date of their first publication.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall print, re-print, publish, sell or expose to sale, or shall cause to be printed, re-printed, published, sold or exposed to sale, any book, treatise, or other literary work, not yet printed, written by any subject of the United States of America, whose name, as author, shall have been thereto prefixed, without consent of the author or authors, or their assigns, during said term, shall forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding three thousand pounds, nor less than five pounds, to the use of such author or authors, or their assigns; to be recovered by action of debt in any court of record proper to try the same.
Provided always, that every author of such book, treatise or other literary work shall, in order to his holding such sole property in them, present two printed copies of each and every of them to the library of the University of Cambridge, for the use of the said university; and prior to the recovery of the said forfeiture, or any part thereof, shall produce, in open court where such action shall be tried, a receipt of such book, treatise, or other literary work from the librarian of the said university for the time being.
Provided also, that this act shall not be construed to extend in favor or for the benefit of any author or authors, subject or subjects of any other of the United States, until the State or States of which such authors are subjects shall have passed similar laws for securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit of publishing their literary productions.
(This act passed March 17, 1788. Chap. 26 of the "Acts and laws passed by the great and general court or assembly of Massachusetts: Begun and held at Boston, the 29th of May, A. D. 1782; and from thence continued by adjournments to Wednesday, the 29th of January following, and then met.")
