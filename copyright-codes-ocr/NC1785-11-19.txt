AN ACT for securing literary property.
Whereas nothing is more strictly a man's own than the fruit of his study, and it is proper that men should be encouraged to pursue useful knowledge by the hope of reward; and as the security of literary property must greatly tend to encourage genius, to promote useful discoveries, and to the general extension of arts and commerce:
I.
Be it enacted by the general assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That the author of any book, map or chart, not hitherto printed, who is a citizen of the United States, and his heirs and assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing, publishing, and vending the same within this State for the term of fourteen years, to commence on the day of its publication;
and if any person or persons within the said term of fourteen years, shall presume to print, reprint, or publish any such book, map or chart within this State, or shall import any copy or copies of the same, which have been reprinted beyond the limits of the State, and shall knowingly publish, distribute, or vend the same without the consent of the author or proprietor, in writing, signed in the presence of two credible witnesses, such offender or offenders shall forfeit to the proprietor all the books, maps or charts thus printed, reprinted, imported, published, or offered for sale, together with double the value of the articles so imported;
one moiety of which money shall go to the State, the other moiety to him who shall sue for the same for the benefit of the party injured, in any court of record within this State.
Provided nevertheless, That no author or proprietor of any such book, map or chart, shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, unless he shall, before publication, duly enter his name as author or proprietor, together with the title of the book, map or chart to be published, in the office of the secretary of the State, who is hereby directed to enter the same on record;
nor unless he shall, before publication, have delivered to the secretary of the State one copy of such book, map or chart for the use of the executive of the State; of which entry and for which copy the secretary is hereby required to give him a certificate and receipt.
II.
And be it further enacted, If the author or publisher of any book as aforesaid, shall set an unreasonable price on the same, regard being had to the probably labour, expence, and risk of such author and publisher, the judges of the supreme court, on complaint thereof made in writing by two or more persons, are hereby authorized and empowered to summons such author or publisher to appear before the next supreme court, to be holden in that county or district where such author or publisher usually resides;
and said court shall enquire into the justice of the complaint, and if the same, on full examination, shall appear to be well founded, they shall correct or settle the price;
and if said author or publisher after such price is fixed by the court, shall sell any book at a higher rate, he shall for every offence forfeit twenty Spanish milled dollars, one moiety to the State and the other moiety to the person who shall sue for the same.
III.
And be it further enacted, That every author who is a citizen in any of the United States, and whose work shall originally be published in any of the United States where laws similar to this are or may be passed for the security of literary property, or his assigns, being also citizens of the United States, shall be entitled to the benefit of this act and none others.
Provided always, That nothing contained in this act shall be construed to prevent any person from reprinting any book, map or chart that has been published; or from importing, reprinting, or publishing any book, map or chart that shall be originally published in any other country;
nor shall anything in this act be construed to encourage or protect any authors or publishers of books, maps or charts which may be dangerous to civil liberty, or to the peace or morals of society
