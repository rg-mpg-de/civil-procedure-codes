Resolution passed by the Continental Congress, Recommending the several States to secure to the Authors or Publishers of New Books the Copyright of such Books.
May 2, 1783.
On the report of a committee, consisting of Mr. Williamson, Mr. Izard and M. Madison, to whom were referred sundry papers and memorials on the subject of literary property.
Resolved, That it be recommended to the several States, to secure to the authors or publishers of any new books not hitherto printed, being citizens of the United States, and to their executors, administrators and assigns, the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication;
and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned, and to their executors, administrators and assigns, the copy right of such books for another term of time not less than fourteen years, such copy or exlusive right of printing, publishing and vending the same, to be secured to the original authors, or publishers, their executors, administrators and assigns, by such laws and under such restrictions as to the several States may seem proper.
