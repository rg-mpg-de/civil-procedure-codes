AN ACT to promote literature.
Whereas it is agreeable to the principles of natural equity and justice that every author should be secured in receiving the profits that may arise from the sale of his or her works; and such security may encourage persons of learning and genius to publish their writings, which may do honour to their country and service to mankind:
I.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of New York, represented in senate and assembly, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That the author of any book or pamphlet, being an inhabitant or resident in these United States, and his or her heirs and assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing, publishing, and vending the same within this State, for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of its first publication in this State;
and if any person or persons within the said term of fourteen years as aforesaid, shall presume to print or re-print any such book or pamphlet within this State, or to import or introduce into this State for sale, any copies of such book or pamphlet, reprinted beyond the limits of this State, or shall knowingly publish, vend, utter, or distribute the same, without the consent of the proprietor thereof in writing, signed in the presence of two credible witnesses, every such person or persons shall forfeit and pay to the proprietor of such book or pamphlet, double the value of all the copies of such book or pamphlet so re-printed, imported, distributed, vended, or exposed to sale, to be recovered by such proprietor in any court of law in this State, proper to try the same.
Provided nevertheless, that no author, assignee, or proprietor of such book or pamphlet, shall be entitled to take the benefit of this act, until he or she shall duly register his or her name, as author, assignee, or proprietor, with the title of such book or pamphlet in the office of the Secretary of this State, who is hereby empowered and directed to enter the same on record.
II.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That at the expiration of the said term of fourteen years, in the cases above mentioned, the sole right of printing and disposing of any such book or pamphlet in this State, shall return to the author thereof, if then living, and his or her heirs or assigns, for the term of fourteen years more, to commence at the end of the said first term, and that all and every person or persons who shall re-print, import, vend, utter, or distribute in this State any copies thereof, without the consent of such proprietor obtained as aforesaid, during the said second term of fourteen years, shall be liable to the same penalties, recoverable in the same manner as is herein before enacted and provided.
And whereas it is equally necessary for the encouragement of learning, that the inhabitants of this State be furnished with useful books at reasonable prices:
III.
Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That whenever any such author or proprietor of such book or pamphlet shall neglect to furnish the public with sufficient editions thereof, or shall sell the same at a price unreasonable, and beyond what may be adjudged a sufficient compensation for his or her labour, time, expences, and risque of sale, any one of the judges of the supreme court of judicature of this State, on complaint made thereof to him in writing, is hereby authorized and impowered to summon such author or proprietor to appear at the next supreme court of judicature,
and the said court are hereby authorized and impowered to enquire into the justice of the said complaint, and if the same be found true, to take sufficient recognizance and security of such author or proprietor, conditioned that he or she shall, within such reasonable time as the court shall direct, publish and offer for sale in this State, a sufficient number of copies of such book or pamphlet, at such reasonable price as the said court shall on due consideration affix,
and if such author or proprietor shall neglect or refuse to give such security as aforesaid, the said court are hereby authorized and empowered to give such complainant a full and ample licence to re-print and publish such book or pamphlet in such numbers and for such term as the said court shall judge just and reasonable:
Provided, Such complainant shall give sufficient security before the said court to afford such re-printed edition at such reasonable price as the said court shall thereto affix.
IV.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That any person or persons who shall procure and print unpublished manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof first had and obtained, if such author or proprietor be living and resident in, or inhabitant of these United States, shall be liable to pay to the said author or proprietor his or her damages for such injury, to be recovered with costs, by action brought on this act in any court of record.
Provided always, that nothing in this act shall extend to effect, prejudice, or confirm the rights which any person may have to the printing or publishing of any book, or pamphlet, at common law, in cases not mentioned in this act; or to authorize any person or persons to print or publish any book, pamphlet, or paper that may be profane, treasonable, defamatory, or injurious to government, morals, or religion.
Provided also, that this act shall not extend or be construed to extend in favour or for the benefit of any author or person residing in, or inhabitant of any other of the United States until the State in which such person resides or dwells shall have passed similar laws in favor of the authors of such new publications and their heirs and assigns.
V.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the trustees of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, of Flat Bush, in the county of Kings, shall be, and they are hereby authorized to grant, bargain, and sell, in fee simple, such part or parts of their real estate within the said county, to such person or persons, and for such price or prices as they may think proper, for the express purpose of erecting an academy in the said county.
Provided, That the quantity which the said trustees shall grant and convey by virtue of this act shall not exceed six acres.
