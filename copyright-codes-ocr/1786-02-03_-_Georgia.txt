AN ACT for the encouragement of literature and genius.
Whereas the principles of natural equity and justice, require that every author should be secured in receiving the profits that may arise from the sale of his works, and such security may encourage men of learning and genius to publish their writings, which may do honor to their country, and service to mankind:
Be it enacted by the representatives of the freemen of the State of Georgia, in general assembly met, and by the authority of the same, That the author of any book or pamphlet not yet printed, or of any map or chart, being an inhabitant or resident in these United States, and his heirs and assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing, publishing, and vending the same, within this State, for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of its first publication in this State:
And if any person or persons, within said term of fourteen years, shall presume to print or re-print any such book, pamphlet, map or chart, within this State, or to import or introduce into this State for sale, any copies thereof, re-printed beyond the limits of this State, or shall knowingly publish, vend, and utter or distribute the same, without the consent of the proprietor thereof in writing, signed in the presence of two credible witnesses, every such person or persons shall forfeit and pay to the proprietor of such book, pamphlet, map or chart, double the value of all the copies thereof so printed, imported, distributed, vended, or exposed for sale, to be recovered by such proprietor in due course of law:
Provided nevertheless, That no author, assignee, or proprietor, or any such book, pamphlet, map or chart shall be entitled to the benefit of this statute, until he shall duly register his name as author, assignee, or proprietor, with the title thereof, in the office of the Secretary of the State, who is hereby empowered and directed to enter the same on record.
II.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That at the expiration of the said term of fourteen years in the cases above mentioned, the sole right of printing and disposing of any such book, pamphlet, map or chart in this State, shall return to the author thereof, if then living, and his heirs and assigns, for the term of fourteen years more, to commence at the end of the said first term:
And that all and every person or persons who shall re-print, import, vend, utter, or distribute in this State, any copies thereof without the consent of such proprietor obtained as aforesaid during the said secondary term of fourteen years shall be liable to the same penalties, recoverable in the same manner as is herein before enacted and provided.
III.
And whereas it is equally necessary for the encouragement of learning, that the inhabitants of this State be furnished with useful books, &c., at reasonable prices:
Be it further enacted, That whenever any such author or proprietor of such book, pamphlet, map or chart shall neglect to furnish the public with sufficient editions thereof, or shall sell the same at a price unreasonable, and beyond what may be adjudged a sufficient compensation for his labor, time, expense, and risk of sale, the chief justice of the State, on complaint thereof made to him in writing, is hereby authorized and empowered to summon such author or proprietor to appear before the next superior court to be holden in the county where such author or proprietor dwells, if a resident of this State, if not, in the county where such complainant dwells, and said court is hereby authorized and empowered to enquire into the justice of such complaint, and if the same be found true to take sufficient security of such author or proprietor conditioned that he shall, within such reasonable time as the said court shall direct, publish, and offer for sale, in this State, a sufficient number of copies of such book, pamphlet, map or chart, at such reasonable price as said court shall, on due consideration, affix;
and if such author or proprietor shall, before said court, neglect or refuse to give such security as aforesaid, the said court is hereby authorized and empowered to give to such complainant a full and ample licence to re-print and publish such book, pamphlet, map or chart in such numbers and for such term as said court shall judge just and reasonable:
Provided, said complainant shall give sufficient security before said court to afford said re-printed edition at such reasonable price as said court shall thereto affix.
IV.
And be it further enacted, That any person or persons who shall procure and print any unpublished manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof first had and obtained, if such author or proprietor be living and resident in, or inhabitant of this or any other of the United States, shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor his just damage for such injury, to be recovered by action brought on this statute in any court of law in this State proper to try the same:
Provided always, That nothing in this act shall extend to affect, prejudice, or confirm the rights which any person may have to the printing or publishing of any book, pamphlet, map or chart at common law, in cases not mentioned in this act, or to screen from legal punishment any person or persons who may be guilty of printing or publishing any book, pamphlet, or paper that may be prophane, treasonable, defamatory, or injurious to government, morals, or religion:
Provided also, That this act shall not extend, or be construed to extend, in favor or for the benefit of any author or person resiging in or orhabitant of any other of the United States until the State or States in which such person or persons reside or dwell, shall have passed similar laws in favor of the authors of new publications, and their heirs and assigns.
William Gibbons, Speaker.
Augusta, February 3, 1786.
