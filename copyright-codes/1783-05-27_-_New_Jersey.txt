AN ACT for the promotion and encouragement of literature.
Whereas learning tends to the embellishment of human nature, the honour of the nation, and the general good of mankind; and as it is perfectly agreeable to the principles of equity, that men of learning who devote their time and talents to the preparing treatises for publication, should have the profits that may arise from the sale of their works secured to them:
Therefore, Sec. 1.
Be it enacted by the council and general assembly of this State, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That the author of any book or pamphlet not yet printed, being an inhabitant or resident in the United States of America, and his heirs and assigns, shall have the exclusive right of printing, publishing, and vending the same within this State for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of its first publication in this State;
and if any person or persons within said term of fourteen years, as aforesaid, shall presume to print any such book or pamphlet withing this State, or to introduce into this State for sale any copies of such book or pamphlet printed beyond the limits of this State, or shall knowingly publish, vend, utter, or distribute the same without the consent of the author or proprietor thereof in writing, duly attested, every such person or persons shall forfeit and pay to the author or proprietor of such book or pamphlet double the value of all the copies of such book or pamphlet so printed, introduced, distributed, vended, or exposed for sale, to be recovered by such author of proprietor in any court of this State where the same may be cognizable:
Provided, nevertheless, That no author, assignee, or proprietor of any such book or pamphlet shall be entitled to the benefit of this act until he shall duly register his name as author, assignee, or proprietor, with the title of such book or pamphlet in the secretary's office of this State, who is hereby required to enter the same on record.
2.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That at the expiration of said term of fourteen years, in the cases herein before mentioned, the exclusive right of printing and disposing of any such book or pamphlet in this State, shall return to the author thereof, if then living, his heirs and assigns, for the term of fourteen years more;
and that all and every person or persons who shall re-print, import, vend, utter, or distribute in this State any copies thereof without the consent of such author or proprietor obtained as aforesaid, during said second term of fourteen years, shall be liable to the same penalties, to be recovered in the same manner as is herein before directed.
Passed at Burlington, May 27, 1783.
