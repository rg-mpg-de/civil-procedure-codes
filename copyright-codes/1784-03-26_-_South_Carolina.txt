AN ACT for the encouragement of arts and sciences.
Be it enacted by the honorable the senate and house of representatives, now met and sitting in general assembly, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, the author of any book or books already printed, who hath not transferred to any other the copy or copies of such book or books, share or shares thereof, or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or re-print the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book or books, for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the said first day of January, and no longer;
and that the author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and re-printing such book or books for the said term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of first publishing the same, and no longer;
and that if any other bookseller, printer or any other person whatsoever, from and after the first day of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, within the times granted and limited by this act as aforesaid, shall print, re-print, or import, or cause to be printed, re-printed, or imported, any such book or books, without the consent of the proprietor or proprietors thereof, first had and obtained in writing signed in the presence of two or more credible witnesses; or knowing the same to be so printed or re-printed, without the consent of the proprietors, shall sell, publish, or expose to sale, or cause to [be] sold, published, or exposed to sale, any such book or books, without such consent first had and obtained as aforesaid; then such offender or offenders shall forfeit such book or books, and all and every sheet or sheets, being part of such book or books, to the proprietor or proprietors of the copy thereof, who shall forthwith damask and make waste paper of them;
and further, that every such offender or offenders shall forfeit one shilling for every sheet which shall be found in his, her, or their custody, either printed or printing, published or exposed to sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act; the one moiety thereof to the State, and the other moiety thereof to any person or persons that shall sue for the same, to be recovered in any court of record of the said State, by action of debt, bill, plaint or information, in which no wager of law, essoign, privilege or protection, or more than one imparlance, shall be allowed.
And whereas many persons may, through ignorance, offend against this act, unless some provision be made whereby the property in every such book, as is intended by this act to be secured to the proprietor or proprietors thereof, may be ascertained, as likewise the consent of such proprietor or proprietors for the printing or re-printing of such book or books may from time to time be known;
Be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That nothing in this act contained shall be construed to extend to subject any bookseller, printer, or other person whatsoever, to the forfeiture or penalties therein mentioned, for or by reason of the printing or re-printing of any book or books, without such consent as aforesaid, unless the title to the copy of such book or books hereafter published, shall, before such publication, be entered in a register book provided for that purpose by the secretary of the State, which register book shall at all times be kept at the secretary's office;
and unless such consent of the proprietor or proprietors be in like manner entered as aforesaid, for every one of which several entries four shillings and eight pence sterling shall be paid, and no more;
which said register book may, at all office hours, be resorted to, and inspected, by any bookseller, printer, or other person, for the purposes before mentioned, without any fee or reward; and the secretary shall, when and as often as thereunto required, give a certificate under his hand of such entry or entries, and for every such certificate may take a fee not exceeding two shillings and four pence.
Provided, That nothing in this act contained do extend, or shall be construed to extend, to prohibit the importation, vending, or selling any book in Greek, Latin, or any other foreign language, printed beyond the seas; anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding.
Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That whenever any such author or proprietor of such book or pamphlet shall neglect to furnish the public with sufficient editions thereof, or shall sell the same at a price unreasonable, and beyond what may be adjudged a sufficient compensation for his labour, time, expences, and risque of sale, the judges of the court of common pleas in this State, on complaint made therof to them in writing, are hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to summon such author, or proprietor, to appear before the next court of common pleas to be holden in the district where such author, or proprietor, dwells, if a resident in this State; if not, in the district where such complainant resides;
and the said court are hereby authorized and required to enquire into the justice of the said complaint; and, if the same be found true, to take sufficient recognizance and security of such author, or proprietor, conditioned that he shall, within such reasonable time as the said court shall direct, publish, and offer for sale in this State, a sufficient number of copies of such book or pamphlet, at such reasonable price as the court shall, on due consideration, affix;
and if such author, or proprietor, shall, before said court, neglect or refuse to give such security as aforesaid, the said court are hereby authorized and empowered to give such complainant a full and ample licence to reprint and publish such book or pamphlet, in such number and for such term as said court shall judge just and reasonable, provided such complainant shall give sufficient security before such court, to afford such re-printed edition at such reasonable price as the said court shall thereto affix.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the inventors of useful machines shall have a like exclusive privilege of making or vending their machines for the like term of fourteen years, under the same privileges and restrictions hereby granted to, and imposed on, the authors of books.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any action or suit shall be commenced or brought against any person or persons whatsoever, for doing, or causing to be done, anything in pursuance of this act, the defendants in such case may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence;
and if, upon such action, a verdict be given for the defendant, or the plaintiff become nonsuited, or discontinue his action, then the defendant shall have and recover his full costs, for which he shall have the same remedy as a defendant in any case by law hath.
Provided nevertheless, That all actions, suits, bills, indictments, or informations, for any offence that shall be committed against this act, shall be brought, sued, and commenced, within three months next after such offence committed, or else the same shall be void and of none effect.
Provided always, That after the expiration of the said term of fourteen years, the sole right of printing, or disposing of copies, shall return to the authors thereof, if they are then living, for another term of fourteen years.
In the senate-house, the 26th day of March, 1784, and in the eighth year of the independence of the United States of America.
John Lloyd, President of the Senate.
Hugh Rutledge, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
