AN ACT for the purpose of securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit publishing their literary productions, for twenty-one years.
Whereas the improvement of knowledge, the progress of civilization, the public weal of the community, and the advancement of human happiness, greatly depend on the efforts of learned and ingenious persons, in the various arts and sciences; as the principal encouragement such persons can have to make great and beneficial exertions of this nature, must exist in the legal security of the fruits of their study and industry to themselves; and as such security is in the natural right of all men, there being no property more peculiarly a man's own than that which is produced by the labour of his mind;
Be it therefore enacted by this general assembly, and by the authority thereof it is enacted, That all books, treatises, and other literary productions, having the name of the author or authors thereof published and printed with the same, shall be the sole property of such author or authors, being citizens of the United States of America, their heirs and assigns, for the full and complete term of twenty-one years from the date of the publication.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall print, reprint, publish, sell, or expose to sale, or shall cause to be printed, reprinted, published, sold, or exposed to sale, any book, treatise, or other literary production, not yet printed, written by any citizien or citizens of the United States of America, whose name or names, as author or authors, shall be thereto prefixed, without the consent of the author or authors, or theirs assigns, during the said term of twenty-one years, shall forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding three thousand pounds, lawful money, nor less than five pounds, to the use of such author or authors, or their assigns, to be recovered by action of debt, in any court of record proper to try the same.
Provided nevertheless, and it is further enacted, That this act shall not be construed to exend to the favour or benefit of any author or authors, being a citizen or citizens of any other of the United States, until the State whereof he or they are citizen or citizens shall pass similar laws for securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit of publishing their literary productions.
