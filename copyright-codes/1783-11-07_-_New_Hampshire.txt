AN ACT for the encouragement of literature and genius, and for securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit of publishing their literary productions, for twenty years.
As the improvement of knowledge, the progress of civilization, and the advancement of human happiness, greatly depend on the efforts of ingenious persons in the various arts and sciences; as the principal encouragement such persons can have to make great and beneficial exertions of this nature, must consist in the legal security of the fruits of their study and industry to themselves; and as such security is one of the natural rights of all men, there being no property more peculiarly a man's own than that which is produced by the labour of his mind:
Therefore, to encourage the publication of literary productions, honorary and beneficial to the public, Be it enacted by the council and house of representatives in general assembly convened, and by the authority of the same, That all books, treatises, and other literary works, having the name or names of the author or authors thereof, printed and published with the same, shall be the sole property of the said author or authors, being subjects of the United States of America, their heirs and assigns, for the full and complete term of twenty years from the date of their first publication.
And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall print, re-print, publish, sell, or expose to sale; or shall cause to be printed, re-printed, published, sold, or exposed to sale, any book, treatise, or other literary work, not yet printed, written by any subject of the United States of America whose name as author shall have been thereto prefixed without the consent of the author or authors, or their assigns, during said term, shall forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding one thousand pounds nor less than five pounds, to the use of such author or authors, or their assigns; to be recovered by action of debt in any court of record proper to try the same.
Provided always, That this act shall not be construed to extend in favour, or for the benefit of any author or authors, subject or subjects of any other of the United States, until the State or States of which such authors are subjective shall have passed similar laws for securing to authors the exclusive right and benefit of publishing their literary productions.
Note.--This act was included in the list of acts repealed, contained in title 30, chap. 230, of "The Revised Statutes, passed December 23, 1842", pp. 475-477.
