AN ACT for the encouragement and promotion of learning by vesting a right to the copies of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies, during the time therein mentioned.
Sec. I.
Whereas the honorable the Congress of the United States, by their resolution of the second day of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, have recommended to the several States to secure to the authors or publishers of any new books not hitherto printed, being citizens of the United States, and to their executors, administrators, and assigns, the copy right of such books for a certain time.
Sec. II.
And whereas printers, booksellers, and other persons have heretofore frequently taken the liberty of printing, reprinting, and publishing, or causing to be reprinted and published books and other writings, without the consent of the author or proprietors of such books and writings, to their very great detriment and the damage of their families;
for preventing, therefore, such practice for the future, and for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful books;
and in order to give all due force to the recommendations of Congress:
Sec. III.
Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted by the representatives of the freemen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in general assembly met, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this act, the author of any book or pamphlet not yet printed, being a citizen of the United States of America, and his heirs and assigns, shall have the exclusive right of printing, publishing, and vending the same within this State for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of its first printing or publication in this State;
and if any person or persons within the term of fourteen years as aforesaid, shall presume to print, publish, vend, or distribute any such book or pamphlet within this State; or to introduce into this State for sale any copies of such book or pamphlet, printed beyond the limits of this State, without the consent of the author or proprietor thereof first lawfully obtained, every such person or persons shall forfeit and pay to the author or proprietor of such book or pamphlet double the value of all the copies of such book or pamphlet so printed, published, vended, distributed or introduced for sale, to be recovered by such author or proprietor in any court of this State where the same may be cognizable; or, if under the value of five pounds, before any two justices of the county where such offense is committed;
Sec. IV.
Provided nevertheless, That no author, assignee, or proprietor of any such book or pamphlet shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, until he shall duly register his name as author, assignee, or proprietor, with the title of such book or pamphlet, in the prothonotary's office in the city of Philadelphia, who is hereby required to enter the same on record, for which he shall receive five shillings and no more.
Sec. V.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That at the expiration of the aforesaid term of fourteen years in the cases herein before mentioned, the exclusive right of printing and disposing of any such book or pamphlet in this State, shall return to the author thereof, if then living, his heirs and assigns, for the term of fourteen years more;
and that all and every person or persons who shall reprint, publish, vend, distribute, or import within this State any copies thereof without the consent of such author or proprietor obtained as aforesaid, during said second term of fourteen years, shall be liable to the same penalties, to be recovered in the same manner as is herein before directed.
Sec. VI.
And provided also, That no author or proprietor of any book or pamphlet shall be entitled to the benefit of this act unless he shall insert on the back of the title page a copy of the certificate of entry obtained by the prothonotary aforesaid, which the said prothonotary is hereby required to grant without any further reward.
Sec. VII.
Provided nevertheless, That this act shall not take place until such time as all and every of the States in the Union shall have passed laws similar to the same, in conformity to the recommendation of Congress aforesaid.
Signed by order of the House, George Gray, Speaker.
Enacted into a law at Philadelphia, on Monday the fifteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four.
Peter Z. Lloyd, Clerk of the General Assembly.
