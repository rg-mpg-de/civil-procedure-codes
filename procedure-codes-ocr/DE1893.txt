oi the return thereof, to answer as therein required, the said bond

action, unless by order of court, or with the plaintiff 's consent.
Sec. 3. The sheriff or officer to whom a bail bond is given, or
his executors, or administrators, shall, upon request, assign it to the

If no sum be indorsed on the writ, the officer executing it shall
set down a reasonable sum.
Sec. 5. Action upon a bail bond must be brought in the same

in such manner as shall be just and equitable.
Sec. 6. Proceedings against bail, on a bail bond taken on an attachment
issued out of the Court of Chancery, shall be by petition

bail shall be his sufficient warrant. If the first scire facias be re
turned "nihil," a second shall be issued and returned before the
liability of the bail is fixed.
Sec. 12. Bail may satisfy any judgment rendered against his
principal; and the plaintiff, or party having the interest tnerein,
sna|i assjgD the same to the bail, or his executors, or administra
tors, at the risk of the assignee, whenever it is so satisfied.
If several persons be bail, one or more, satisfying the judgment,
shall be entitled to the assignment.

believes that said defendant is about to leave the State, and to re
move his effects, and has refused to give better security for the debt,

such debtor, shall, on the return of the writ, be obliged to give bet
ter security for the payment of such debt, if the court, on hearing,

PasseJ at Dover, February 21 , 18jt).
[Sec. 3. If the defendant in the attachment, or any sufficient person
for him, will, at any time before judgment, appear and give security
to the satisfaction of the plaintiff in such cause, or to the satisfac
tion of the court and to all actions brought against such defendant,
to the value of the property, rights, credits and moneys attached,
and the costs, then the garnishees and all property attached shall
be discharged. The security may be taken thus : " On the
day of 18 — A. B. becomes security in the sura of
that C. D. shall answer the demand of E. F. in this suit,
and shall satisfy any judgment to the extent of the value of the
property attached, that may be recovered against him therein,"
which entry, on the appearance docket, shall be signed by the se
curity, and shall be an obligation of record of the same force and
effect, and subject to the same remedy by an action of debt, as any
other obligation for the payment of money may be.]
Sec. 4. The sheriff, or other officer, shall, under such writ, attach
all the defendant's property real and personal, and his rights and
credits that can be found ; and shall take possession of the said
personal property, rights and credits, and have them inventoried ami

the plaintiff's suit, for the use of all the defendant's creditors, and
that he doth summon him, as a garnishee, to appear and answer as

sonal property, chattels and effects, so attached, shall be delivered to
the sheriff, unless the garnishee will give security for the same.
Sec. 5. The sheriff, or other officer, shall return a particular ac
count of all property, rights, or credits, attached, and the appraised
value thereof, and the names of all garnishees summoned.
Sec. 6. If any property, so attached, is of a perishable nature,
or will cause expense in its keeping, the court, or any judge thereof,

Sec 7. If any garnishee, duly summoned shall not appear as
required, he may be compelled, by attachment, to appearand an-
swer, or plead ; and he shall be so compelled within two terms, or

answers under oath that he had no money, goods, chattels, rights,
credits, or effects of the defendant, liable to attachment, in his
hands, or possession, at the time he was notified of the attachment,
or at any time after, he shall be discharged.
He may also, at the election of the plaintiff, or other creditor,
make a special declaration ; upon which judgment shall be rendered
by the court according to law.
But if any creditor of the defendant shall require him to plead,
he shall not be permitted to answer, but shall plead " nulla bona,"
on which the plaintiff, or any other creditor, may take issue and
go to trial.
And if it be found that the garnishee had, at the time he was
notified of the attachment, or at any time after and before his plea
pleaded, any money, goods, chattels, or effects, of the defendant in
his hands, or possession, the jury shall render a verdict for the
plaintiff, or such other creditor, and assess damages to the value of
such property, and judgment shall be entered against such garnishee
therefor, with costs ; but the money, levied thereon, shall be dis-
tributed among all the defendant's creditors as is hereinafter di
rected.
Sec. 8. Any judgment against a garnishee as aforesaid, shall be

of the defendant therein, or any credible person in behalf of
such plaintiff, or creditor, will make affidavit that any garnishee,
summoned or to be summoned thereon, is not an inhabitant of the
county where the attachment is depending, or that he believes such
garnishee is about to leave the said county, and that he also be
lieves that such garnishee has property of the defendant in his hands,

creditors (except such of them as have sued out attachments before

the defendant, who shall be barred from any dividend or benefit
under this proceeding,) and shall adjust and ascertain all their de
mands, including that of the plaintiff in the attachment.
Sec 11. The auditors shall severally be sworn faithfully to dis
charge their duty according to the best of their skill and knowl
edge.

and their subsequent sittings shall be by adjournment duly made
and publicly announced.
They may investigate any claim presented, in any form they
judge best, and may examine any of the creditors upon oath.
On the receipt of the proceeds of sale of the property attached,
or any part thereof, the auditors shall calculate and settle the pro
portions, and dividends due the several creditors, allowing to the
creditors attaching and prosecuting the same to judgment, a double
share, or dividend, if such shall not exceed their debt ; and they
shall make report to the next term of the court after such appor
tionment, and on confirmation of the report, shall forthwith, on
pain of attachment, pay over to the several creditors their respec
tive shares of such proceeds according to such apportionment.
Sec. 12. The court may hear exceptions to, and correct such ac
count and report, either in the allowance, or regulation of claims,
in the calculations, dividends, or apportionment or otherwise.
Sec. 13. Provided that before any creditor shall receive any div
idend, or share, so distributed, he shall, with sufficient surety, enter
into recognizance to the debtor, before the prothonotary, in a suffi
cient sum, to secure the payment of the same or any part thereof, if
the said debtor shall, within one year thereafter, appear in the said
court and disprove or avoid such debt or such part thereof.
The proceeding for this purpose may be by motion to the court,
and an issue framed and tried before the same.
Sec. 14. Every creditor who shall neglect duly to present his
claim, in person or by attorney, to said auditors, according to
notice, or to make proof thereof, as required, shall be debarred from
receiving any share, or dividends in the distribution to be made by
the auditors.
Sec. 15. Judgment shall be given for the plaintiff in the attach
ment the second term after issuing the writ, unless the defendant
shall enter special bail as aforesaid ; whereupon, the court shall
make an order that the sheriff shall sell the property attached, on
due notice, and pay the proceeds (deducting legal costs and charges)
to the auditors for distribution.
Sec. 16. Any balance remaining due to the creditors, after such
distribution of the proceeds, may be collected as other debts; and
any overplus, after paying all the claims allowed and costs, shall be
returned to the defendant, or his executors, administrators, or as
signs.
Sec. 17. Any surety of the defendant by recognizance, bond, bill,
assumption or otherwise, shall be entitled to prove the claim, arising
on such liability, before the auditors, and to share in the distri
bution.
Sec. 18. No second writ of domestic attachment shall issue
against the defendant, unless the first shall not be executed, or
shall be quashed, or dissolved by the court, or discontinued by the
plaintiff with consent of a majority of the creditors: and if the
plaintiff shall die, or be satisfied of his debts, it shall not stop the
proceedings ; but the name of his executor, or administrator, or of
any other creditor, may, on suggestion of the fact, be substituted in
his stead.
Sec. 19. A writ of foreign attachment may be issued against any
*
person not an inhabitant of this State, after a return to a summons,
or capias, issued and delivered to the sheriff, or coroner, ten days
before the return thereof, showing that the defendant cannot be
found, and proof, satisfactory to the court, of the cause of action;
or upon affidavit made by the plaintiff, or some other credible per
son, and filed with the prothonotary, that the defendant resides out
of the State, and is justly indebted to the said plaintiff in a sum ex
ceeding fifty dollars. [And where there are two or more defendants,
one a resident of the State but without available means to
pay the plaintiff's claim, the fact may be so stated in such
affidavit, and the attachment thereon may issue against the
non-resident defendant or defendants with the same effect as if such
non-resident defendant or defendants was or were the only defend
ant or defendants in the cause.]
Sec. 20. The said writ shall be framed, directed, executed and
returned, and like proceedings had, as in the case of a domestic attach-
inent except as to the appointment of auditors and distribution among
creditors ; for every plaintiff in a foreign attachment shall have the
benefit of his own discovery, and, after judgment, may proceed, by
order of sale, fieri facias, capias ad satisfaciendum or otherwise, as
on other judgments.
Provided, that before receiving any sum under such judgment,
the plaintiff shall enter into recognizance as required by section 13
preceding.
Sec. 21. All sales under this chapter shall be good against the
defendant, his executors, administrators and assigns ; and if action
be brought against any officer, or other person, acting under the
authority of this chapter, he may, under the general issue, give this
chapter in evidence in his justification.
Section i. A writ of foreign attachment may be issued out of the Superior Court of
this State against any corporation, aggregate or sole, not created by or existing under
the laws of this State, upon affidavit made by the plaintiff or any other credible person,
and filed with the prothonotary of said court, that the defendant is a corporation not
created by, or existing under the laws of this State, and is justly indebted to the said
plaintiff in a sum of money, to be specified in said affidavit, and which shall exceed
fifty dollars.
Sec. 2. The said writ shall be framed, directed, executed and returned, and like
proceedings had as in the case of a foreign attachment issued under the chapter to
which this act is a supplement, except that attachments to be issued under this act shall
be dissolved only in the manner hereinafter provided.
Sec. 3. In any attachments to be issued under this act, judgment shall be given for
the plaintiff at the second term after the issuing of the writ, unless the defendant shall
have caused an appearance by attorney to be entered, in which case the like proceed
ings shall be had, as in suits commenced against a corporation by summons : Pro
vided, however, if the defendant in the attachment, or any sufficient person for him,
shall, at any time before judgment, give security for the payment of any judgment thai
may be recovered in said proceedings with costs, then the garnishees and all the prop
erty attached, shall be discharged, and the attachment dissolved, and like proceedings
be had as in other cases of foreign attachment under the act to which this is a sup
plement, in which the attachment has been dissolved by special bail. Such security
shall be approved, and the form and amount thereof determined by the court in term
time, or by any judge thereof, in vacation : but the court may prescribe the form of
such security by general rule in that behalf.

transcribing pleadings, judgments, and other proceeedings in actions
of law, and such regulations as to the payment of costs, and other
wise for carrying into effect the said alterations, as to them may
seem expedient : provided, that no such rule shall have the effect of
depriving any person of the power of pleading the general issue,
and of giving the special matter in evidence, in any case where such
power is, or shall be given by act of the general assembly.
Sec. 2. Such rules shall be so framed as to promote and require
conciseness, brevity and plainness in pleading, without regarding
form, further than it is necessary, or conducive to these objects.
Sec. 3. The said judges, shall also have power, by such rules, to
regulate the taking depositions, or excepting thereto, the distribuHon
of money in court, the order and manner of trying causes
and of pleading, of notices, and all other matters regulating the

cases not expressly provided for by lavv.
They shall, before the next fall term, revise the rules of said
court with a view to the attainment, as far as practicable, of thet

have previously filed in the cause an affidavit stating that he or
they verily believes or believe there is a legal defence to the whole
or part of such cause of action, and setting forth the nature and
character of the same ; if the defence be to a part only of the cause

payment of such judgment, with interest and costs, in such
form as by the rules of the court shall be prescribed. In case of
a suit by or against a corporation, the affidavit by the cashier or
treasurer shall be sufficient in this section. In case of security be
ing given as aforesaid by the defendant, the entry of such security

ration of the stay given, the said judgments, with costs, may be
collected by execution process sued out jointly or severally against
said principal and surety. Any affidavit authorized under the pro

special bail had been given as aforesaid.
The amount of a judgment by virtue of this section, shall be ascertained
under the order of the court, and shall not exceed the sum

AN ACT IX RELATION TO THE ACTION OF REPLEVIN.

no proof of demand shall be necessary, but the bringing of the suit shall be considered
a sufficient demand for all purposes, and the failure at the trial to prove any demand
shall not be a cause for non-suit, nor shall such failure inure in anywise whatsoever
to the benefit or advantage of the defendant or defendants in the suit.

Section I. That any hotel-keeper, inn-keeper, or other person who keeps a livery
or boarding stable, and for price or reward at such stable furnishes food or care for any
horse, or has the custody or care of any carriage, cart, wagon, sleigh or other vehicle,
or any harness, robes, or other equipments for the same, shall have a lien upon such
horse, carriage, cart, wagon, sleigh, vehicle, harness, robes or equipments, and the
right to detain the same to secure the payment of such price or reward, and may, snb-
ject to the provisions of this act hereinafter contained, after the expiration of fifteen
days from the time the same or any part thereof became due and payable, the same re-
maining unpaid in whole or in part, sell the property upon which he has such lien at
public sale, at such livery or boarding stable, to the highest and best bidder or bidders
therefor, first giving at least ten days notice of such sale by handbills posted in five or
more public places in the county in which such sale is to be had and by advertisement
in a newspaper published in said county, describing the property to be sold and naming
the day, hour and place of sale thereof, and may apply the money arising from said sale
to the payment of the amount then remaining due, including therein compensation at
the same rate as such stipulated price or reward for food, care or custody furnished or
bestowed as aforesaid up to the time of sale, together with the costs and expenses of
sale ; provided, however, that in case either before or after such price or reward has become
due and payable, the keeper of such stable has parted with the possession or cus-
((K]y 0r (rie pr0per(y subject to such lien, he may (if the contract for food, care or cus
tody as aforesaid was made with the owner of the aforementioned property), at any
time within the space of ten days from the time of such parting with the possession or
custody thereof, make an affidavit, to be filed in the office of a justice of the peace of
the county in which such stable is situated, describing such property and stating the
amount of such price or reward then remaining due and payable, from whom owing,
an<^ t'lat tne same 's justly and truly due ; and it shall thereupon be the duty of such
justice of the peace forthwith to issue to a constable a warrant for the seizure of such
property and for the delivery thereof to the keeper of such stable, and such constable
shall forthwith, at any place within such county, seize and deliver such property pursuant
to sucn warrant, and thereafter the keeper of such stible shall have the righi,
unless there has been a previous execution and levy for an amount exceeding the
value of the property, or unless such property has been sold fairly for a valuable consid-
eration and delivered to the purchaser after the keeper of such stable has parted with
its possession or custody and before such seizure thereof, to sell the same in manner
aforesaid, after giving notice as aforesaid, and may apply the money arising from such
jn manner aforesaid. The balance, if any, of the proceeds of sale shall be paid to
the owner or owners of the property sold ; but in case such owner or owners cannot be
found such balance shall be deposited in the Farmers' Bank of the State of Delaware,
for the county in which such sale has been had, to the credit of such owner or owners.
Provided, however, that if the owner or owners of the property subject to such lien,
and detained by or seized and delivered to the keeper of such stable, shall at any time
after such price or reward has in whole or in part become due and payable, and before
sale, demand such property from the keeper of such stable, such lien shall be los
unless the keeper of such stable shall, within the space of fifteen days from the making
of such demand upon him sell such property under and in accordance with the provis
ions hereinbefore contained.
Sec. 2. That an action of replevin shall lie to recover the property detained by or
seized and delivered to the keeper of a livery or boarding stable as aforesaid, with
damages and costs for the detention thereof, at any time before sale thereof as aforesaid,
against the keeper of such stable at the suit of the person or persons having the
right, aside from any lien under the provisions of this act, to the immediate possession
of such property, whether having the general or only a special property therein, the
plaintiff or plaintiffs in the action, or some substantial person for him, her, or them,
with sufficient surety satisfactory to the officer to whom the writ of replevin is directed,
entering into bond to such officer before service of such writ in a penalty double the
value of such property, to be estimated by such officer, with condition according to the
following form :
The condition of the above written obligation is such, that if , at whose suit
against a writ of replevin has been issued out of the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware for county, returnable to term next, or ex
ecutors or administrators, shall prosecute said suit with effect, and shall fully and with
out delay abide by and satisfy any judgment which shall be given against the said, or executors or administrators, in the said suit, then the said ob
ligation shall be void.
The defendant in the replevin may plead generally non cepit, non detinuit, prop-
erty in a stranger, or an avowry of detention, in accordance with the provisions of fhis
act, stating the amount claimed to be due and payable to him at the time of the replevy
for food, care, or custody furnished or bestowed as aforesaid, which amount may inelude
not only the stipulated price or reward then due and payable for the same, but
also compensation at the same rate for food, care, or custody furnished or bestowed, as
aforesaid, up to the time of such replevy. Such defendant may plead any or all of the
above pleas ; provided, however, that an avowry shall always be accompanied by and
tried or considered in connection with the plea of property in a stranger ; andfurther,
that neither the plea of non cepit or non detinuit shall ever accompany or be tried or
r e r j
considered in connection with an avowry. He may also plead such other pleas, not
inconsistent with the provisions or purposes of this act, as the court, by general rule
or upon special application, shall allow.
Sec. 3. The plea of non cepit shall have the same effect as heretofore. Upon
the plea of non detinuit it shall be incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove a demand
upon the defendant before the commencement of the action for the deliver)' to him of
the property replevied, or a sufficient excuse for the omission of such demand. Upon
the plea of property in a stranger, it shall be incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that
at the time of the commencement of the action he had the right, aside from any lien
under the provisions of this act, to the immediate possession of the goods and chattels
replevied, whether as having the general or only a special property therein.
Sec. 4. The judgment of the court if entered for the plaintiff upon the plea of non
.•pit or non detinuit, shall be against the defendant for costs and damages for the detention
until the time of the replevy, to be assessed by a jury, but if entered for the de
fendant upon either of said pleas, the judgment shall be against the plaintiff for costs.
Judgment, if entered for the plaintiff upon the plea of property in a stranger, shall be
against the defendant for costs and damages for detention as aforesaid, but if entered
for the defendant upon said plea the judgment shall be against the plaintiff for costs
and for a return of the property replevied within ten days, or the value thereof, to
gether with damages for the detention thereof from the time of replevy, such value
and damages to be separately assessed by a jury. Judgment, if entered for the plain
tiff upon an avowry, shall, if the issue upon the accompanying plea of property in a
stranger be determined in favor of the plaintiff, be against the defendant for costs and
damages for detention until the time of replevy, to be assessed as aforesaid ; but if the
issue upon such accompanying plea be determined in favor of the defendant, judgment
shall be against the plaintiff for costs and for a return of the property, or the value
thereof, with damages for detention from the time of replevy as aforesaid. Judgment,
if entered for the defendant upon an avowry, shall, if the issue upon the accompany
ing pica of property in a stranger be determined in favor of the defendant, be againii
the plaintiff for costs and for a return of the property or the value thereof, with dam
ages for detention from the time of replevy as aforesaid ; but if the issue upon such ac
companying plea be determined in favor of the plaintiff, the judgment shall be against
the plaintiff for costs and for the amount due to the defendant for food, care, or custody
furnished or bestowed, to be assessed as aforesaid.
Sec. 5. If there be judgment of non-suit, or by default, or upon demurrer, or other
wjSCj w ithout trial by jury, the value of the property replevied, or damages for deten-
tion thereof, or the amount due to the defendant lor food, care, or custody furnished or
bestowed as aforesaid, may be assessed and determined either by a jury at the bar, or
upon a writ of inquiry, or otherwise, as the court shall order ; and thereupon such
judgment may be entered as the court shall deem in furtherance of the provisions or
purpose of this act. The court shall also, subject to the provisions of this act, deter
mine the judgment to be entered where two or more pleas are tried or considered to
gether, and shall make such orders or rules for the disposition of the cause upon its
merits as it shall deem proper or necessary. It may also regulate the practice of is
suing writs for the enforcement of any judgment entered in accordance with the pro
visions of this act.
Sec. 6. If judgment be given for the defendant, or his executors or administrators,
the officer to whom the bond was given lrefore the service of the writ of replevin shall,
on request, assign the same, under his hand and seal, in the presence of at least one
credible witness, to the defendant in the writ, or his executors or administrators, and
the assignee or assignees may sue on the bond in his, her, or their own name or name.-.
Sec. 7. If, after a judgment for a return, the property replevied, or any part thereof,
be returned in an injured or depreciated condition, and such injury or depreciation ha.resulted
from the wrong or negligence, since the replevy, of any other person than the
defendant therein, his executors or administrators, the defendant, or his executors
or administrators, may recover upon the bond aforesaid, so assigned as aforesaid, in
addition to the moneys which shall have been adjudged to him or them in such action
of replevin, damages to the extent of such injury or depreciation.
Section i. That from and after the passage of this act each and every colt in this
State shall be liable for the service of the stallion, its sire. Provided, however, that
in any and all cases where the pedigree or qualities of the stallion is misrepresented by
its owner or agent, then the foal shall not be liable for the service as aforesaid.
Sec. 2. And in order for the owner or owners of any stalion or stallions to avail themselves
of the benefits of this act, it shall be necessary for such owner or owners to have
printed and posted, at ten of the most public places in the county in which the said
stallion or stallions are to stand or travel, a full description and pedigree of his or their
stallion or stallions, and to exhibit a copy to the owner of any mare or mares about to
be served by such stallion or stallions. After sixty days from the day the foal was
dropped, and a refusal to pay by the then owner of the mare and colt, it shall be the
duty of the owner of the stallion, the sire of such cold, to bring his action for the ser
vice of the stallion, as per agreement. And if the justice of the peace shall be satislied
of the correctness of the claim and give judgment in favor of such owner, he may
at once take out execution on such judgment, and when so executed the lien shall re
vert back to the day of the foaling of such colt, and shall be a paramount and
prior lien on such colt to any other execution or mortgage.
Section 1. Lands, tenements and hereditaments, where no sufficient
personal estate can be found, may be seized and sold upon
judgment and execution obtained.
Sec. 2. The following goods and chattels, the property of white

reprises, of such lands and tenements will be sufficient, within seven
years, to satisfy the debt, or damages, and costs in such execution,
and shall certify and return such inquisition annexed to the writ
under which the same is made. Ten days' written notice of such
inquisition shall be served personally on the defendant, or left at

ments by virtue of any writ of fieri facias to hold an inquisition
as aforesaid, upon such lands and tenements, and to return the same
within thirty days after the date of such rule.
Sec. 5. If such rule shall be laid upon a sheriff who did not take

tion of the lands and tenements returned on said writ.
Sec. 6. A rule to hold an inquisition shall be served, in writing,
upon the person on whom it is laid, at least ten days before the ex

inquisition, as aforesaid, it shall appear that the rents and profits,
beyond reprises, of the lands and tenements taken in execution are
sufficient, within seven years, to satisfy the debt, or damages, and
costs in such execution, a writ of elegit may issue, under which the
lands and tenements inquired on shall be delivered to the plaintiff'
in the execution, to be held until the debt, or damages, and costs
are levied by a reasonable extent, in the same manner as lands are
delivered upon writs of elegit in England.

other debt, or damages, shal 1 be recovered against the same defend
ant, his heirs, executors, or administrators, which, with what remains
due upon that extent, cannot all be satisfied within seven years out
of the rents and profits of the premises extended, the sheriff shall

the person, or persons, so in possession, and deliver the premises to
the plaintiff, or his agent, without inquiring into the defendant's
title thereto.
Sec. 12. If the defendant in the elegit shall hold only an B
undivided share of the lands and tenements mentioned in the writ, h
the other owner, or owners, of a share, or shares, shall not be re

said.
Sec. 13. If the sheriff, upon executing a writ of elegit, shall not
find the defendant, nor any person holding under him, in possession s

same jury, upon oath, or affirmation, into the title of the defendant
in the elegit to the premises therein mentioned, and shall certify
and return such inquisition annexed to the writ under which it is
made.
Sec. 14. If, by such inquisition, it shall be found that the lands
and tenements, mentioned in the writ of elegit, are liable to be taken

sionem, under which the sheriff shall deliver to the plaintiff, or his
agent, the said premises, and remove from the possession of the
same the person, or persons, possessed thereof, and all persons who
may become possessed thereof at any time after said inquisition.

to execution for said debt, or damages, and costs.
Sec. 16. If the jury, upon an inquisition as aforesaid, shall find
that the lands and tenements mentioned in the writ of elegit are notco
liable to execution for the debt, or damages, and costs therein, the
plaintiff shall not be thereby concluded, but may proceed in such
manner as he might do before the passing of this chapter.
Sec. 17. If a person holding lands under a writ of elegit, whether
the original tenant, his executors, administrators, or assigns, lie
evicted, by due course of law, from the same, or any part thereof,
before the amount to be levied by the said writ is satisfied, the
court, out of which the writ issued, shall, upon application, grant a
rule to show cause why the said writ and return thereupon shall
not be vacated and other execution awarded upon the judgment, or
other relief granted according to the circumstances of the case.
Upon this rule the court shall exercise equitable powers. They may
direct an account of rents and profits, and in such account may

tion was determined, and all proper items.

Assets in the hands of an executor, or administrator, to pay a legacy,
shall create a legal liability and raise a consequent promise to
pay it. In case there be not assets to pay the whole legacy, a part
may be recovered.
If the delivery of a specific legacy have been refused, the value
of it may be recovered in this action.
Sec. 2. An infant legatee may sue for his legacy by guardian, ore
next friend, as in other cases.
Sec. 3. If there be assets sufficient to pay the debts of a testator,
with a surplus not sufficient to pay all the legacies bequeathed, an
abatement from the legacies respectively, shall be made in propor
tion to their several amounts, unless it be otherwise provided by
the will.
Sec. 4. Upon the plea of a want of assets to pay all the debts
and legacies, the court shall appoint auditors to examine the ac-
counts of the executor, or administrator with the will annexed ;
who, after full hearing of the parties upon notice to them respec
tively of the times and places of such hearing, shall report the con
dition of the said accounts, what assets will remain after payment
of the debts aforesaid, and what proportion of such residue is prop
erly applicable to the plaintiff's legacy, having regard to all such
settlements of said accounts as may have been made before any
court, or officer, having authority to settle the same.
Sec. 5. Exceptions may be taken by either of the parties to the
report of auditors appointed as aforesaid ; and thereupon the court,
upon hearing the exceptions, may correct any errors in such report.

insufficient to pay all the debts and legacies of the testator, execu
tion shall be awarded only for such proportion of the assets as mar
be properly applicable to the plaintiff's legacy ; but judgment for
the whole legacy shall be entered and shall stand as a security for
the payment of the residue of the legacy, when sufficient assets for

trator. A scire facias shall lie for further execution, suggesting
that other assets have come to the hands of the executor, or admin
istrator.

costs. In case of inexcusable neglect, or delay, on the part of the
executor, or administrator, to pay the legacy demanded, or a pro
portional part thereof, the court may, in its discretion, order that

brought for a legacy, without a reasonable demand for the same
first made upon the executor, or administrator, who ought to pay
the same.
Sec. 8. The court shall exercise equitable powers in requiring
the plaintiff to give security to refund the legacy, or any part there
of, and also in respect to the delivery and acceptance of a specific

mised premises ; the tenant, or person, so holding over, shall, either
of them, at the landlord's election, be liable to pay double the rent
that was payable according to the demise, to be recovered by action,

withholding of possession shall be deemed a forcible detainer and
may be proceeded upon as such.

and the petitioner shall thereupon be discharged from imprisonment
at the suit of the party causing such entry to be made.
Such entry shall in no manner impair the said recognizance, nor
have any other effect than to discharge the petitioner from further
imprisonment at the suit of the party causing it to be made.
[But any person imprisoned as aforesaid may prefer a petition to
the Superior Court in term time, or to any judge thereof in vacation,
setting forth that he is willing and able to give to the said creditor
good and sufficient security for the payment of the said debt or
damages or costs as aforesaid, within a reasonable time ; and if,
upon the hearing of the said petition, and reasonable notice in
writing of the time and place thereof to the party at whose suit the

such proceeding, or order, shall be detained for such other cause,
according to the nature and effect thereof.
Sec. 39. The foregoing provisions for the discharge of a person
imprisoned on civil process, upon failure of the party at whose suit
such person is imprisoned to indemnify the county as aforesaid,
shall not apply to the case of a prisoner remanded by the court upon
the trial of allegations of fraud, or for refusing his consent to serve
his creditor; nor to the case of a white citizen of this State im
prisoned by virtue of a capias ad satisfaciendum, or for the non
performance of a decree for the payment of money, upon an affida
vit of fraud ; nor to the case of any person whatsoever imprisoned
by virtue of civil process, whether original, or final, or whether

fraud shall be filed within five days after his imprisonment, as
