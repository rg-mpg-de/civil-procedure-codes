delivered up to the said plaintiff or plaintiffs, upon their giving
sufficient security for the return thereof, to such person and in
such manner as the court shall direct.
SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, That the court shall also ap-
point some day in the succeeding term for the absent defendant
or defendants to enter his, her, or their appearance to the suit,
and give security for performing the decree, a copy of which
order shall by direction of the court be forthwith published in
any newspaper within this Territory, the circulation of which
shall in the opinion thereof be best calculated to apprise the ab
sent defendant or defendants of the pending of such suit, and
continued for two months successively ; and another copy thereof
shall be posted at the front door of such court-house. If such
absent defendant shall not appear, and give such security, within
the time limited, or such further time as the court may allow,
for good cause shown, the court may proceed to take such proof
as the complainant shall offer; and if they shall thereupon be
satisfied of the justice of the demand, they may order the bill to
be taken as confessed, and make such order or decree thereon,
as shall appear just; and may enforce due performance and execution
thereof, by such ways and means as have been heretofore
used for enforcing other decrees, requiring the complainant or
complainants to give security, as the court shall approve, for
abiding such future orders as may be made for restoring the
estate or effects to the absent defendants, upon his, her, or their
appearance and answering the bill ; and if the complainant or
complainants shall refuse to give, or not be aole to procure such
security, the effects shall remain, under the direction of the court,
in the hands of a receiver, or otherwise, for so long a time, and
shall then be finally disposed of in such manner as to the court
shall seem just.
SEC. 3. Be it further enacted, That if any person or per-
sons who shall be out of the Territory at the time a decree is
pronounced as aforesaid, shall within seven years from the pass-
ing such decree, return and appear openly : or in case of his
or her death, if his or her heir, executor or administrator shall,
within the said seven years, be and appear openly within this
Territory, the plaintiff or plaintiffs, their executors or adminis
trators, shall serve such person or persons, so returning and ap
pearing, with a copy of the decree, within a reasonable time af
ter such return or appearance shall be known to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs ; and thereupon such defendant or defendants, or their
representatives may, within twelve months after such service, or
those defendants not served with a copy, or their representatives,
may within seven years after the decree pronounced, appear in
court and petition to have the cause reheard ; and upon their
paying down, or giving security for the payment of such costs
as the court shall think reasonable, they shall be admitted to
answer the bill, and issue may be joined, and witnesses on both
sides examined, and such other proceedings, decree, and execu
tion had, as may be just and right in the cause ; but if the seve
ral defendants, or their representatives, upon whom the decree
shall be so served, shall not, within twelve months after sueh
service, and the other defendants, or the representatives, upon
whom no such service is made, shall not within seven years from
the time of the decree pronounced, appear and petition to have
the cause reheard as aforesaid, and pay, or secure to be paid,
such costs as the court shall think reasonable, all and every de
cree to be made in pursuance of this act against any defendant
or defendants so failing, shall stand absolutely confirmed against
him, her, or them ; and at the end of such term, the court may
make such further order for quieting the plaintiff or plaintiffs in
any such suits in their possession, and title to the estate and
effects so sequestered, or made liable, as to them shall seem rea
sonable.
SEC. 4. Be it further enacted, That in all cases whatever,
where a suit is or shall be depending in any court, concerning
any matter or other thing whatever, against any absent defend
ant or defendants, the court may, on satisfactory proof to them
made, that such defendant or defendants is, or are out of thisTerritery,
or that upon inquiry at his, her, or their usual place
of abode, he, she, or they could not be found, make any similar
order to that which is directed to be made in the case of absent
debtors, adapting the same to the nature of the case ; a copy of
which order shall be published in like manner as is directed in
the case of absent debtors, and thereupon the proceedings in re
lation to such absent defendant shall be in all respects the same,*
both before and after the decree, as are above prescribed in re
lation to absent debtors, so far as such proceedings against ab
sent debtors shall be applicable to such absent defendants.
