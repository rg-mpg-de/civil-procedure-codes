put in issue the material and express allegations of the com· 
plaint.

the complaint might subject the party to prosecution for fel­
ony or misdemeanor.

ment, and the complaint contained [contains] a copy of such
instrument, or a copy is annexed thereto, the genuineness

mitted, unless the answer denying the same be verified. 

§ 54. When the defense to an action is founded on a
written instrument, and a copy thereof is contained in the

mencement of the term at which the action is to be tried, an
affidavit denying the same; provided, that the due execution
of the instrument shall not be deemed to be admitted by a

§ 55. In all cases of the verification of a pleading, the 
affidavit of the party shall state that the same is true of his
own know ledge, except as to the matters which are therein

fied, it shall be by the affidavit of the party, unless he be ab­
sent, from t.he county where the attorney resides, or from 
some cause unable to verify it, or the fucts are within the
knowledge of his attorney, or other person verifying ~be 
snme. When the pleading is verified by the attorney, or
any other person except the party, he shall set forth iu the
affidavit the reasons why it is not made by tbe party. Wbeu
a corporation is a party, the verificatiou may be made hy any
officer thereof; or when the State, or any officer thereof in
its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by uny
person acquainted with the facts, except that in actions pro­
secuted by the attorney-general iu behalf of the State the
pleadings need not, in any case, be verified.

court or officer of especial jurisdiction, it shall not be ueces­
sary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judg­
ment or determination may be stated to have been duly given
or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party plead­
ing shall be bound to establish on the trial the facts confer­
ring jurisdiction. 

§ 60. In pleading the performance of conditions prece­ 
dent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts
showing such performance; but it may be stated generally
that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part ;

sary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the pur­
pose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defam­
atory matter out of which the cause of action arose ; but it
shall be sufficient to state generally, that the same was pub­
lished or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allega­
tion be controverted, the plaintiff shall establieh on the trial 
· that it was so published or spoken. 


§ 63. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the de­
fendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the mat­
ter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances
to reduce the amount of damages; and whether he prove the 
justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances. 

§ 64. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in
the same complaint, when they all arise out of:

without damages, for the withholding thereof, or for waste 
committed thereon, and the rents and profits of the same ; or,
Third. Claims to recover specific personal property, with 
or without damages for the withholding thereof.
Fourth, Claims ugainst a trustee by virtue of a contract or 
by operation of law ; or,
F{fth. Injuries to character; or,
Sixth, Injuries to person ; or,
Serenth, Injuries to property. 
But the causes of action so united shall all belong to one
only of these classes, and shall affect all the parties to the
action, and not require different places of trial, and shall be
separately stated; provided, however, that an action for
malicious arrest and prosecnt ion , or either of them, may be
nnited with an action for either an injury to character or to
the person.

§ 65. Every material allegation of the complaint or cross 
complaint not controverted by the answer thereto, shall for
the purposes of the action he taken as true: the statement of
matters in avoidance shall on the trial be deemed controverted
by the adverse party.

§ 66. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential
to the claim, or defense, and which could not be stricken from
the pleading without leaving it insufficient.  

§ 67. After demurrer, and before the trial of the issue of
law thereon, the pleadings demurred to may be amended as
of course and without costs by filing the same as amended
and serving a copy thereof on the adverse party or his attor­
ney within ten days, who shall have ten days thereafter in 
which to demur or answer thereto; but a party shall not so 
amend more than once. A demurrer shall not be deemed
waived by the filing of an answer at the same time of filing
the demurrer; and when the demurrer to a complaint is over­
ruled, and there is no answer filed, the court may upon terms
allow an answer to be filed. If a demurrer to the answer be
overruled, the facts alleged in the answer shall be considered
as denied to the extent mentioned in section sixty-five.
Where circumstances occurring subsequently to the com­
mencement of the action render it proper, the same may be
presented hy supplemental pleadings and issue taken thereon
in the same manner as in the case of original pleadings.

§ 68. The court may, in furtherance of justice, aud on 
such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or pro­
ceedings by adding or striking out the name of any party, or
by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake

whole sum deposited and remaining unapplied.

deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the
property, on account thereof.
