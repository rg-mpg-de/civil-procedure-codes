upon the defendants affected thereby. The defendant
must answer the complaint, as amended, within such
time as the Court may direct, and judgment by default
may be entered upon failure to answer, as in other
cases.

§ 433. When any of the matters enumerated
in Section 430 do not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection may be taken by answer.

§ 434. If no objection be taken, either by
demurrer or answer, the defendant must be deemed to
have waivedithe same, excepting only the objection to
the jurisdiction of the Court, and the objection that
the complaint does not state facts sufiicient to constitute a cause of action. .

§ 437. The answer of the defendant shall contain:

1. If the complaint be verified, a specific denial to
each allegation of the complaint controverted by the
defendant, or a denial thereof according to his information and belief. If the complaint be not verified,
then a general denial to each of said allegations; but
a general denial only puts in issue the material allege»
tions of the complaint; I

2. A statement of any new matter in avoidance, or
constituting a defense or counter claim.

§ 438. The counter claim mentioned in the
last section must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against a plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and arising
out of one of the following causes of action:

1. A cause of action arising out of the transaction
set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the
plaintiii"s claim, or,connected with the subject of the
action;

2. In an action arising upon contract; any other
cause of action arising also upon contract and existing
at the commencement of the action.

§ 439. If the defendant omit to set up a counter
claim in the cases mentioned in the first subdivision
of the last section, neither he nor his assignee can
afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff
therefor. '

§ 440. When cross demands have existed
between persons, under such circumstances that, if one

had brought an action against the other, a counter
claim could have been set up, neither can be deprived
of the benefit thereof by the assignment or death of
the other; but the two demands must be deemed compensated so far as they equal each other. But a claim
existing in favor of the maker of a negotiable instrument and against a holder after maturity, intermediate
between the payee and the last holder, is not a cross
demand.

§ 441. The defendant may set ,forth by
answer as many defenses and counter claims as he may
have. They must be separately stated, and the several defenses must refer to the causes of action which
they are intended to answer, in a manner by which
they may be intelligibly distinguished. The defendant may also answer one or more of the several causes
of action stated in the complaint and demur to the
residue. ‘

§ 443. The plaintiff may, within the same
length of time after service of the, answer as the defendant is allowed to answer after service of summons,

demur to the answer of the defendant.

§ 444. The demurrer may be taken upon one or
more of the following grounds:

1. ‘That several causes of counter claim have been
improperly joined;

2. That the answer does not state facts sufiicient to
constitute a defense or counter claim;

3. That the answer is ambiguous, unintelligible, or
uncertain.

§ 446. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party or his attorney; and when the

complaint is verified, or when the State, or any otliceri

of the State, in his ofiicial capacity, is plaintiff, the
answer must be verified, unless an admission of the
truth of the complaint might subject the party to a
criminal prosecution, or unless an oilicer of the State,
in his ofiicial capacity, is defendant. In all cases of a
verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the party
must state that the same is true of his own knowledge,
except as to the matters which are therein stated on

' his information or belief, and as to those matters,

that he believes it to be true; and where a pleading is
verified, it must be by the affidavit of a party, unless
the parties are absent from the county where the
attorney resides, or from some cause unable to verify
it, or the facts are Within the knowledge of his attorney

or other person verifying the same. When the plead-_

ing is verified by the attorney, or any other person
except one of the parties, he must set forth in the anidavit the reasons why it is not made by one of the
parties. When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof.

§ 447. When an action is brought upon a
Written instrument, and the complaint contains a copy

of such instrument, or a copy is annexed thereto, the

genuineness and due execution of such instrument are
deemed admitted, unless the answer denying the same

be verified.

§ 448. When the defense to an action is
founded on a Written instrument, and a copy thereof is
contained in the answer, or is annexed thereto, the

geuuineness and due execution of such instrument are
deemed admitted, unless the plaintiff file with the
Clerk, live days before the commencement of the
term at which the action is to be tried, an afiidavit

denying the same.

§ 449. But the execution of the instruments
mentioned in the two preceding sections, is not deemed
admitted by a failure to deny the same under oath, if
the party desiring to controvert the same, is, upon
demand, refused an inspection of the original.

§ 452. In the construction of a pleading, for
the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations
must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial
justice between the parties. '

§ 453. Sham and irrelevant answers,
and irrelevant and redundant matter inserted in a
pleading, may be stricken out, upon such terms as the
Court may, in its discretion, impose.

§ 454. It is not necessary for a party to set
forth in a pleading the items of an account therein

alleged, but he must deliver to the adverse party,‘

within five days after a demand thereof in writing, a
copy of the account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The Court, or a Judge thereof, or a
County Judge, may order a further account, when the

one delivered is too general, or is defective in any particular.

§ 455. In an action for the recovery of real
property, it must be described in the complaint with
such certainty as to enable an ofiicer, upon execution,
to identify it.

§ 456. In pleading a judgment or other
determination of a Court, officer, or Board, it is not
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but
such judgment or determination may be stated to have
been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish on the
trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.

§ 457. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it is not necessary to
state the facts showing such performance, but it may
be stated generally that the party duly performed all
the conditions on his part, and if such allegation be
controverted, the party pleading must establish, on the
trial, the facts showing such performance.

§ 458. In pleading the Statute of Limitations it is
not necessary to state the facts showing the defense,
but it may be stated generally that the cause of action
is barred by the provisions of Section (giving the
number of. the section and subdivision thereof, if it is
so divided, relied upon) of THE CODE or CIVIL PaoCEDURE; and if such allegation be controverted, the
party pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts
showing that the cause of action is so barred.

§ 459. In pleading. a private statute, or a
right derived therefrom, it is suiiicient to refer to such

‘ statute by its title and the day of its passage.

§ 460. In an action for libel or slander it is
not necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic
facts for the purpose of showing the application to the
plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the
cause of action arose; but it is sufiicient to state, generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff must establish on the trial that it
was so published or spoken.

§ 461. In the actions mentioned in the last section the defendant may, in his answer, allege both
the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and
any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount

‘of damages; and Whether he prove the justification or

not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

§ 462. Every material allegation of the
complaint, not controverted by the answer, must, for
the purposes of the action, be taken as true; the statement of any new matter in the answer, in avoidance
or constituting a defense or counter claim, must, on
the trial, be deemed controverted by the opposite

party.

§ 463. A material allegation in a pleading
is one essential to the claim or defense, and which
could not be stricken from the pleading Without leaving it insufficient.

§ 464. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint or answer, alleging facts material
to the case occurring after the former complaint or
answer.

§ 465. All pleadings subsequent to the complaint
must‘ he filed with the Clerk and served upon the adverse party or his attorney.

§ 469. No variance between the allegation
in a pleading and the proof is to be deemed material,
unless it have ac"tually misled the adverse party to his
prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense upon
the merits. Wheiiever it is alleged that a party has
been so misled, that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and thereupon the Court may
order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as
may be just.

§ 470. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the Court may direct the
fact to- be found according to the evidence, or may
order an immediate amendment, without costs.

§ 471. Where, however, the allegation of the claim
or defense to which the proof is directed, is unproved,
not in some particular or particulars only, but in its
general scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a
case of variance, within the last two sections, but a
failure of proof.

§ 472. Any pleading may be amended once
by the party of -course, and without costs, at any time
before answer or demurrer filed, or after demurrer and
before the trial of the issue of law thereon, by filing
the same as amended and serving a copy on the adverse
party, who may have ten days thereafter in which to
answer or demur to the amended pleading. A demurrer is not waived by filing an answer at the same time;
and when the demurrer to a complaint is overruled
and there is no answer filed, the Court must allow an
answer to be hled. If ‘a demurrer to the answer is
overruled, the facts alleged in the answer must be considered as denied, to the extent mentioned in Section 462.

§ 473. The Court may, in furtherance of
justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend
any pleading or proceedings, by.adding or striking out
the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in
the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect;
and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for ahswer
or demurrer. The Court may likewise, upon affidavit
showing good cause therefor, after notice to the adverse
party, allow, upon such terms as may be just, a11 amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may, upon like terms, allow an answer to be

made after the time limited by this Code; and may,
upon such terms as may be just, and upon payment
of costs, relieve a party, or his legal representatives,
from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken
against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; and when, for any cause
satisfactory to the Court, or the Judge at chambers,
the party aggrieved has been unable to apply for the
relief sought during the term at. which such judgment,
order, or proceeding complained of was taken, the
Court, or the Judge at chambers, in vacation, may
grant the relief upon application made within a reasonable time, not exceeding five months after the adjournment of the term. When, from any cause, the summons and a copy of the complaint in an action have
not been personally served on the defendant, the Court
may allow, on such terms as may be just, such defendant, or his legal representative, at any time within six
months after the rendition of any judgment in such
action, to answer to the merits _of the original action.

§ 474. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the
name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the
complaint, and such defendant may be designated in
any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when
his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.

§ 475. The Court must, in every stage of
an action, disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and no judgment shall be
reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.

or freeholder, within the county;

2. Each must be worth the amount specified in the

give the defendant a certificate of the deposit made,
and the defendant must be discharged from custody.

§ 498. The Sheriff must, immediately after
the deposit, pay the same into Court, and take from the
Clerk receiving the same two certificates of such payment, the one of which he shall deliver to the plaintiff ’s

§ 503. A defendant arrested may at any

time before the justification of bail apply to the Judge 1
who made the order, or the Court in which the action 1

is pending, upon reasonable notice, to vacate the order

of arrest or to reduce the amount of bail. If the p

application is made upon aflidavits on the part of the
defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose
the same by affidavits or other proofs, in addition to
those on which the order of arrest was made.

§ 504. If, upon such ‘application, it appears
that there was not suflicient cause for the arrest, the
order must be vacated; or if it appears that the bail
was fixed too high, the amount must be reduced.

adjudged, and for the payment to him of such sum as
may from any cause be recovered against the plaintiff,
the Sheriff must forthwith take the propeity described
in the afiidavit, if it be in the possession of the defendant or his agent, and retain it in his custody. He

Post Office, directed to the defendant.

§ 513. The defendant may, within two days
after the service of a copy of the afiidavit and undertaking, give notice to the Sheriff that he excepts to the
sufhciency of the sureties. If he fails to do so, he is
deemed to have waived allobjections to them. When
the defendant excepts, the sureties must justify on
notice in like manner as upon bail on arrest; and the
Sheriff is responsible for the sufiiciency of the sureties
until the objection to them is either waived or until
they justify. If the defendant except to the sureties,
he cannot reclaim the property as provided in the next section.

§ 514. At any time before the delivery of
the property to the plaintiff, the defendant may, if he
do not except to the sureties of the plaintiff, require
the return thereof, upon giving to the Sheriff a written
undertaking, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in double the
value of the property, as stated in the afiidavit of the
plaintiff, for the delivery thereof to the plaintiff, if
such delivery be adjudged, and for the payment to him
of such sum as may, for any cause, be recovered against

of notice to the defendant, it must be delivered to the
plaintiff, except as provided in Section 519.

§ 515. The defendant’s sureties, upon
notice to the plaintiff of not less than two or more

than five days, must justify before a Judge or County
Clerk, in the same manner as upon bail on arrest; and
upon such justification the Sheriff must deliver the
property to the defendant. The Sheriff is responsible
for the defendant’s sureties until they justify, or until
the justification is completed or waived, and may retain the property until that time. If they, or others
in their place, fail to justify at the time and place appointed, he must deliver the property to the plaintiff.

§ 516. The qualification of sureties must
be such as are prescribed by this Code, in respect to

power of his county.

§ 518. When the Sheriff has taken property, as in this Chapter provided, he must keep it in a
secure place, and deliver it to the party entitled thereto, upon receiving his fees for taking and his necessary expenses for keeping the same.

by any other person than the defendant or his agent,
and such person make aflidavit of his title thereto,
or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds
of such title or right, and serve the same upon the
Sheriff, the Sheriff is not bound to keep the property
or deliver it to the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff, on
demand of him or his agent, indemnify the Sheriif
against such claim, by an undertaking by two sumcient sureties; and no claim to such property by any

other person than the defendant or his agent is valid
against the Sheriff unless so made.

§ 520. The Sheriff’ must file the notice,
undertaking, and afhdavit, with his proceedings thereon, with the Clerk of the Court in which the action is
pending, within twenty days after taking the property
mentioned therein.

and also the title of the person in whose behalf the
undertaking was given to the property in dispute.

§ 525. An injunction is a writ or order
requiring a person to refrain from a particular act. It
may be granted by the Court in which the action is
brought, or by a Judge thereof, or by a County Judge;
and when made by a Judge, it may be enforced as the
order of the Court.

§ 526. An injunction may be granted in
the following cases:
1. When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief,
or any part thereof‘, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either
for a limited period or perpetually;

2. When it appears by the complaint or aflidavit
that the commission or continuance of some act during
the litigation would produce waste, great or irreparable

injury to the plaintiff;

3. When it appears during the litigation that the
.defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or
is procuring or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the plaintiff’s rights, respecting the subject
of the action, and tending to render the judgment
ineffectual. '

§ 527. The injunction may be granted at
the time of issuing the summons, upon the complaint,
and at any time afterwards, before judgment, upon

afiidavits. The complaint in the one case, and the
afiidavits in the other, must show satisfactorily that
sufiicient grounds exist therefor. No injunction can
be granted on the complaint unless it is verilied.
When granted on the complaint, a copy of the complaint and verification attached must be served with
the injunction; when granted upon aflidavit, a copy of
the afiidavit must be served with the injunction.

§ 528. An injunction cannot be allowed
after the defendant has answered, unless upon notice,
or upon an order to show cause; but in such case the
defendant may be restrained until the decision of the
Court or Judge granting or refusing the injunction.

or Judge must require, except where the people of

the State are a party plaintiff, a written undertaking
on the part of the plaintiff, with suilicient sureties, to
the effect that the plaintiff will pay to the party
enjoined such damages, not exceeding an amount to be
specified, as such party may sustain by reason of the
injunction, if the Court finally decide that the plaintiff
was not entitled thereto.

§ 530. If the Court or Judge deem it proper
that the defendant, or any of several defendants, should
be heard before granting the injunction, an order may
be made requiring cause to be shown, at a specihed
time and place, why the injunction should not be

undertaking mentioned in the next section, an order
may be made, releasing from the operation of the
attachment any ‘or all of the property attached, and all
of the property so released, and all of the proceeds of
the sales thereof, must be delivered to the defendant,
upon the justification of the sureties on the undertaking, if required by the plaintiff.

§ 555. Before the making such order, the
Court or Judge must require an undertaking on behalf

of the defendant, by at least two sureties, residents

and freeholders or householders in the county, to the

effect that in case the plaintiff recover judgment in

the action, defendant will, on demand, redeliver the

attached property so released, to the proper officer, to
be applied to the payment of the judgment, and that
in default thereof the defendant and sureties will, on
demand, pay to the plaintiff the full value of the property released. The Court or Judge making such order
may fix the sum for which the undertaking must be
executed, and if necessary in fixing such sum to know
the value of the property released, the same may be
appraised by three disinterested persons to be appointed for that purpose. The sureties may be required
to justify before the Court or Judge, and the property
attached cannot be released from the attachment without their justification, if the same be required.

before the time for answering expires, apply, on

§ 691. The Sheriff must execute the writ
against the property of the judgment debtor, by levying on a sufficient amount of property, if there be
sufficient; collecting or selling the things in action,
and selling the other property, and paying to the plaintiff or his attorney so much of the proceeds as will
satisfy the judgment; any excess in the proceeds over
the judgment and the Sheriff ’s fees must be returned
to the judgment debtor. VVhen there is more property of the judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and the Sheritf"s fees, within the
View of the Sheriff, he must levy only on such part of
the property as the judgment debtor may indicate.

§ 692. Before the sale of property on execution, notice thereof must be given, as follows:

1. In case of perishable property: by posting written notice of the time and place of sale in three public
places of the township or city where the sale is to take
place, for such time as may be reasonable, considering

nor more than ten days successively;

3. In case of real property: by posting a similar

4. “Then the judgment under which the property is
to be sold is made payable in a specified kind of money
or currency, the several notices required by this section must state the kind of money or currency in which
bids may be made at such sale, which must be the
same as that specified in the judgment.

§ 693. An officer selling without the notice
prescribed by the last section forfeits five hundred
dollars to the aggrieved party, in addition to his actual
damages; and a person willfully taking down or defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale or the

§ 694. All sales of propertylunder execution must be made at auction, to the highest bidder,
between the hours of nine in the morning and five in
the afternoon. After suilicient property has been sold
to satisfy the execution, no more can be sold. Neither
the officer holding the execution nor his deputy can
become a purchaser, or be interested in any purchase,
at such sale. VVhen the‘ sale is of personal property,
capable of manual delivery, it must be within view of
those who attend the sale, and be sold in such parcels
as are likely to bring the highest price; and when the
sale is of real property, consisting of several known
lots or parcels, they must be sold separately; or when
a portion of such real property is claimed by a third
person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such
portion must be thus sold. The judgment debtor, if
present at the sale, may also direct the order in which
property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such
property consists of several known lots or parcels, or

of articles which can be sold to advantage separately,
and the Sheriff must follow such directions.

§ 695. If a purchaser refuse to pay the
amount bid by him for property struck off to him at a
sale under execution, the ofiicer may again sell the

any loss be occasioned thereby the ofiicer may recover
the amount of such loss, with costs, by motion, upon
previous notice of five days before any Court, or before any Justice of the Peace, if the same does not
exceed his jurisdiction.

§ 696. Such Court of justice must proceed
in a summary manner and give judgment, and issue
execution therefor forthwith, but the defendant may
claim a’ jury; and the same proceedings may he had
against any subsequent purchaser who refuses to pay,
and the officer may, in his discretion, thereafter reject
the bid of any person so refusing.

§ 697. The two -preceding sections must
not be construed to make the oiizicer liable for any
more than the amount bid by the second or subsequent purchaser, and the amount collected from the
purchaser refusing to pay.

§ 698. “Then the purchaser of any personal property capable of manual delivery pays the
purchase money, the officer making the sale must
deliver to the purchaser the property, and, if desired,
execute and deliver to him a certificate of the sale.
Such certificate conveys to the purchaser all the right
which the debtor had in such property on the day the
execution or attachment was levied.

§ 699. VVhen the purchaser of any personal property not capable of manual delivery pays
the purchase money, the officer making the sale must.

execute and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of
sale. Such certiiicate conveys to the purchaser all
the right which the debtor had in such property on
the day the execution or attachment was levied.

§ 700. Upon a sale of real property, the
purchaser is substituted to, and acquires all the right, title, interest, and claim of the judgment debtor
thereto; and when the estate is less than a leasehold
of two years’ unexpired term, the sale is absolute. In
all other cases the property is subject to redemption,
as provided in this Chapter. The oflicer Inust give
to the purchaser a certitic-ate of sale, containing:

1. A particular description of the real property sold;

2. The price bid for each distinct lot or parcel;

3. The whole price paid;

4. ‘When subject to redemption, it must be so
stated.

And when the judgment, under which the ‘sale has
been made, is made payable in a specified kind of
money or currency, the certificate must also show the
kind of money or currency in which such redemption
may be made, which must be the same as that speciiied in the judgment. -A duplicate of such certificate

must be filed by the oflicer in the ofhce of the
Recorder of the county.

§ 701. Property sold subject to redemption,
as provided in the last section, or any part sold separately, may be redeemed in the manner hereinafter
provided, by the following persons, or their successors
in interest:

1. The judgment debtor, or his successor in interest,
in the whole or any part of the property;

2. A creditor having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the property sold, or on some share or part
thereof, subsequent to that on which the property was
sold. The persons mentioned in the second subdivision of this section are, in this Chapter, termed redemptioners.

§ 702. The judgment debtor or redemptioner may redeem the property from the purchaser
Within six months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with twelve per
eent thereon in addition, together with the amount of
any assessment or taxes which the purchaser may have
paid thereon after the purchase, and interest on such
amount; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to ‘that of the redemptioner, other than
the judgment under which such purchase was made,
the amount of such lien, with interest.

§ 703. If property be so redeemed by a
redemptioner, either the judgment. debtor or another
redemptioner may, within sixty days after the last
redemption, again redeem it from the last redemptioner, on paying the sum paid on such last redemption, with four per cent thereon in addition, and
the amount of any assessment or taxes which the last
redemptioner may have paid thereon after the redemption by him, with interest on such amount, and,
in addition, the amount of any liens held by said last
redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The
judgment under which the property was sold need not
be so paid as a lien. The property may be again, and
as often as the debtor or a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner,
within sixty days after the last redemption, with four
per cent thereon in addition, and the amount of any
assessments ortaxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption by him, with interest
thereon, and the amount of any liens, other than the
judgment under which the property was sold, held
by the last redemptioner previous to his own, with
interest. Notice of redemption must be given to the

Sheriff. If no redemption be made within six months
after the sale, the purchaser, or his assignee, is entitled to a conveyance; or, if so redeemed, whenever
sixty days have elapsed, and no other redemption has
been made, and notice thereof given, and the time for
redemption has expired, the last redemptioner, or his
assignee, is entitled to a Sheriff's deed. If the debtor
redeem at any time before the time for redemption
expires, the effect of the sale is terminated, and he is
restored to his estate.

§ 704. The payments mentioned in the
last two sections may be made to the purchaser or

redemptioner, or for him, to the officer who made the sale. Wheii the judgment under which the sale has
been made is payable in a specified kind of money or
currency, payments must be made in the same kind
of money or currency, and a tender of the money is
equivalent to payment.

§ 705. A redemptioner must produce to
the officer or person from whom he seeks to redeem
and serve With his notice to the Sheriff: _

1. A copy of the docket of the judgment under
which he claims the right to redeem, certified by the

the Recorder;

2. A copy of any assignment necessary to establish
his claim, verified by the affidavit of himself, or of a
subscribing witness thereto;

3. An affidavit by himself or his agent, showing the
amount then actually due on the lien.

§ 706. Until the expiration of the time
allowed for redemption, the Court may restrain the
commission of waste on the property, by order granted
with or without notice, on the application of the purchaser or the judgment creditor. But it is not waste
for the person in possession of the property at the
time of sale, or entitled to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to
use it in the same manner in which it was previously
used; or to use in the ordinary course of husbandry;
or to make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon;
or to use Wood or timber on the property therefor; or
for the repair of fences; or for fuel in his family, while
he occupies the property.

§ 707. The purchaser, from the time of the
sale until a redemption, and al1'etIempti’oner,-Iivmabe
time of his redemption until another redemption, is
entitled to receive, from the tenant in possession, the
rents of the propert.y sold, or the value of the use and
occupation thereof. But when any rents or profits
have been received by the judgment creditor or purchaser, or his or their assigns, from the property thus
sold preceding such redemption, the amounts of such
rents and profits shall be a credit upon the redemption
money to be paid; and if the redemptioner or judgment debtor, before the expiration of the time allowed

for such redemption, demands in writing of such pur-O

chaser or creditor, or his assigns, a written and verified

statement of the amounts of such rents and profits thus received, the period for ‘redemption is extended use
days after such sworn statement is given by such purchaser or his assigns, to such redemptioner or debtor.
If such purchaser or his assigns shall, for a period of
one 1nont.h from and after such demand, fail or refuse
to give such statement, such redemptioner or debtor
may bring an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction, to compel an accounting and disclosure of such
rents and profits, and until fifteen days from and after
the ‘dual determination of such action, the right of
redemption is extended to such redemptioner or debtor.

§ 708. If the purchaser of real property
sold on execution, or his successor in interest, be
evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in
the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal
or discharge of the judgment, he may recover the
price paid, with interest, from the judgment creditor.
If the purchaser of property at Shcritf’s sale, or his
successor in interest, fail to recover possession in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning
the sale, or because the property sold was not subject
to execution and sale, the Court having jurisdiction
thereof must, after notice and on motion of such party
in interest, or his attorney, revive the original judgment in the name of the petitioner, for the amount
paid by such purchaser at the sale, with interest
thereon from the time of payment at the same rate
that the original judgment bore; and the judgment so
revived has the same force and effect as would an
original judgment of the date of the revival, and no
more.

§ 709. W’hen property, liable to an execution against
several persons, is sold thereon, and more than a due
proportion of the judgment is satisfied_ out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of one of them, or
one of them pays, without a sale, more than his proportion, he may compel contribution from the others;
and when a judgment is against several, and is upon
an obligation of one of them, as security for another,
and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof,
either by sale of his property or before sale, he may
compel repayment from the principal. In such case,
the person so paying or contributing is entitled to the
benefit of the judgment, to enforce contribution or
repayment, if, within ten days after his payment, he
tile with the Clerk of the Court where the judgment
was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to contribution or repayment. Upon a filing of such notice,

the Clerk must make an entry thereof in the margin
of the docket.

§ 714. When an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several
debtors in the same judgment, issued to the Sheriff
of the county where he resides, or, if he do not
reside in this State, to the Sheriff of the county where
the judgment roll is filed, is returned unsatisiied, in
whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time
after such return is made, is entitled to an order from
the Judge of the Court, or a County Judge, requiring
such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property, before such Judge, or a referee
appointed by him, at a time and place specified in
the order; but no judgment debtor must be required
to attend before a Judge or referee out of the county
in which he resides.

§ 715. After the issuing of an execution
against property, and upon proof by atlidavit of a

party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the Court, or

of a Judge thereof, or County Judge, that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to
apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such
Court or Judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place
before such Judge, or a referee appointed by him, to
answer concerning the same; and such proceedings
may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction
of the judgment as are provided upon the return of
an execution. Instead of the order requiring the
attendance of the judgment debtor, the Judge may,
upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or
attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of
the debtor absconding, order the Sheriff to arrest the
debtor and bring him before such Judge. Upon
being brought before the Judge he may be, ordered
to enter into an undertaking, with sufficient surety,
that he will attend from time to time before the
Judge or referee, as may be directed, during the
pendency of proceedings and until the final termination thereof‘, and will not in the meantime dispose of
any portion of his property not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking he
may be committed to prison.

§ 716. After the issuing of an execution
against property, and before its return, any person
indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the
Sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof
as may be necessary to satisfy the execution; and
the Sheriff ’s receipt is a sufficient discharge for the
amount so paid.

§ 717. After the issuing or return of an
execution against property of the judgment debtor, or
of any one of several debtors in the same judgment,
or upon proof by affidavit or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the Judge, that any person or corporation
has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted
to him in an amount exceeding fifty dollars, the Judge
may, by an order, require such person or corporation,
or any officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place before him, or a referee appointed
by him, and answer concerning the same.

§ 718. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify before the Judge or referee, upon any
proceeding under this Chapter, in the same manner
as upon the trial of an issue.

§ 719. The Judge or referee may order
any property of a judgment debtor, not exempt from
execution, in the hands of such debtor or any other
person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied
towards the satisfaction of the judgment.

§ 720. If it appears that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment
debtor, or to be indebted to him, claims an interest in
the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, the
Court or Judge may authorize, by an order made to
that effect, the judgment creditor to institute an action
against such person or corporation, for the recovery of
such interest or debt; and the Court or Judge may,
by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such
interest or debt, until an action can be commenced
and prosecuted to judgment. Such order may be
modiiied or vacated by the Judge granting the same,
or the Court in which the action is brought, at any
time, upon such terms as may be just.

§ 721. If any person, party, or Witness
disobey an order of the referee, properly made, in the
proceedings before him under this Chapter, he may
be punished by the Court or Judge ordering the reference, for a contempt.

§ 726. There can be but one action for the

recovery of any debt, or the enforcement of any right
secured by mortgage upon real estate or personal prop
erty, which action must be in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter. In such action, the Court
may, by its judgment, direct a sale of the incumbered
property (or so much thereof as may be necessary),
and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the
payment of the costs of the Court and the expenses of
the sale, and the amount due to the plaintiff ; and if
it appear from the Sheriff's return that the proceeds

are insufficient, and a balance still remains due, judgment can then be docketed for such balance against
the defendant or defendants personally liable for the
debt, and it becomes a lien on the real estate of such
judgment debtor, as in other cases on which execution
may be issued. N 0 person holding a conveyance from
or under the mortgagor of the property mortgaged, or
having a lien thereon, which conveyance or lien does
not appear of record in the proper ofBce at the time
of the commencement of the action, need be made a
party to such action; and the judgment therein rendered, and the proceedings therein had, are as conclusive against the party holding such unrecorded conveyance or lien as if he had been made a party to the
action.

§ 727. If there be surplus money remaining, after payment of the amount clue on the mortgage, lien,—or incumbrance, with costs, the Court may
cause the same to be paid to the person entitled to it,
and in the meantime may direct it to be deposited in
Court.

§ 728. If the debt for which the mortgage,
lien, or incumbrance is held is not all due, so soon as
sufficient of the property has been sold to pay the
amount due, with costs, the sale must cease; and afterwards, as often as more becomes due, for principal or
interest, the Court may, on motion, order more to be
sold. But if the property cannot be sold in portions,
Without injury to the parties, the whole may be ordered
to be sold in the f1rst instance, and the entire debt and
costs paid, there being a rebate of interest where such
rebate is proper.

§ 731. Anything which is injurious to health,
or indecent, or bffensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with
the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance, and the subject of an action. Such action may
be brought by any person whose property is injuriously
affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the
nuisance; and by the judgment the nuisance may be
enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered.

§ 732. If a guardian, tenant for life or
years, joint tenant, or tenant in common of real property, commit waste thereon, any person aggrieved by
the waste may bring an action against him therefor,
in which action there may be judgment for treble
damages.

§ 733. Any person who cuts down or carries off any wood or underwood, tree, or timber, or
girdles or otherwise injures any tree or timber on the
land of another person, or on the street or highway in
front of any person’s house, village, or city lot, or cultivated grounds; or on the commons or public grounds
of any city or town, or on the street or highway in
front thereof, without lawful authority, is liable to the
owner of such land, or to such city or town, for treble

the amount of damages which may be assessed therefor, in a civil action,'in any Court having jurisdiction.

§ 734. Nothing in the last section authorizes the recovery of more than the just value of the
timber taken from uncultivated woodland for the
repair of a public highway or bridge upon the land,
or adjoining it.

§ 735. If a person recover damages fora
forcible or unlawful entry in or upon, or detention of
any building or any cultivated ‘real property, judgment

the actual damages are assessed.



§ 738. An action may be brought by any person 3
against another who claims an estate or interest in '

real property adverse to him, for the purpose of determining such adverse claim. '

§ 739. If the defendant in such action
disclaim in his answer any interest or estate in the
property, or suffer judgment to be taken against him
without answer, the plaintiff’ cannot recover costs.

§ 740. In an action for the recovery of real
property, where the plaintiff showsa right to recover
at the time the action was commenced, but it appears
that his right has terminated during the pendency of
the action, the verdict and judgment must be according to the fact, and the plaintiff may recover damages
for withholding the property.

§ 741. When damages are claimed for
withholding the property recovered, upon which permanent improvements have been made by a defendant,
or those under whom he claims, holding under color of title adversely to the claim of the plaintiff, in good
faith, the value of such improvements must be allowed
as a set-off against such damages.

§ 742. The Court in which an action is
pending for the recovery of real property, or for damages for an injury thereto, or a Judge thereof, or a
County Judge, may, on motion, upon notice by either
party, for good cause shown, grant an order allowing
to such party the right to enter upon the property and
make survey and measurement thereof, and of any tunnels, shafts, or drifts thereon, for the purpose of the
action, even though entry for such purpose has to be
made through other lands belonging to parties to the
action. '

§ 743. The order must describe the property, and a copy thereof must be served on the owner
or occupant; and thereupon such party may enter upon
the property, with necessary surveyors and assistants,
and make such survey and measurement; but if any

A unnecessary injury be done to the property he is liable

therefor.

§ 744. A mortgage of real property shall
not be deemed a conveyance, whatever its terms, so
as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover

§ 745. The Court may, by injunction, on
good cause shown, restrain the party in possession from
doing any act to the injury of real property during the
foreclosure of a mortgage thereon; or, after a sale on
execution, before a conveyance.

§ 746. When real property has been sold
on execution, the purchaser thereof, or any person who
may have succeeded to his interest, may, after his
estate becomes absolute, recover damages for injury to
the property by the tenant in possession after sale, and
before possession is delivered under the conveyance.

§ 747. An action for the recovery of real
property against a person in possession cannot be prejudiced by any alienation made by such person, either
before or after the commencement of the action.

§ 748. In actions respecting mining claims,
proof must be admitted of the customs, usages, or
regulations established and in force at the bar or dig- ‘
gings embracing such claim; and such customs, usages,

this State, must govern the decision of the action.

§ 752. When severaleco-tenants hold and

are in possession of real property as parceners, joint
tenants, or tenants in common, in which one or more

more of such persons for a partition thereof, according

§ 755. Immediately after filing the complaint in the District Court, the plaintiff must file with
the Recorder of the county, or of the several counties
in which the property is situated, either a copy of such
complaint or a notice of the pendency of the action,
containing the names of the parties so far as known,
the object of the action, and a description of the property to be affected thereby. From the time of the
filing it shall be deemed notice to all persons.

§ 756. The summons must be directed to
all the joint tenants and tenants in common, and all
persons having any interest in, or any liens of record
by mortgage, judgment, or otherwise upon the property, or upon any particular portion thereof; and generally, to all persons unknown who have or claim any

proof must be required of the right of the absent or
unknown parties before such judgment is rendered;
except that where there are several unknown persons
having an interest in the property, their rights may be
considered together in the action, and not as between
themselves.

§ 760. Whenever from any cause it is, in
the opinion of the Court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to make a complete partition, in the first instance, among all the parties in interest, the Court may
first ascertain and determine the shares or interest
respectively held by the original co-tenants, and thereupon adjudge and cause a partition to be made, as if
such original co-tenants Were the parties, and sole parties, in interest, and the only parties to the action, and
thereafter may proceed in like manner to adjudge and

existed and were of record at the time of the commencement of the action, and the persons holding such
liens are not made parties to the action, the Court must
either order such persons to be made parties to the
action, by an amendment or supplemental complaint,
or appoint a referee to ascertain Whether or not such
liens or incumbrances have been paid, or if not paid,
what amount remains due thereon, and their order
among the liens or incumbrances severally held by
such persons and the parties to the action, and whether
the amount remaining due thereon has been secured
in any manner, and if secured, the nature and extent
of the security.

§ 762. The plaintiff must cause a notice to
be served, a reasonable time previous to the day for
appearance before the referee appointed as provided in
the last section, on each person having outstanding
liens of record, who is not a party to the action, to

appear before the referee at a specified time and place,
to make proof, by his own aiiidavit or otherwise, of
the amount due, or to become due, contingently or
absolutely thereon. In case such person be absent, or
his residence be unknown, service may be made by
publication or notice to his agents, under the direction
of the Court, in such manner as may be proper. The
report of the referee thereon must be made to the
Court, and must be confirmed, modified, or ‘set aside,

and a new reference ordered, as the justice of the case

and established by evidence, or if it appear by the
evidence without such allegation in the complaint, to

part of it, is so situated that partition cannot be made

order a sale thereof. Otherwise, upon the requisite
proofs being made, it must order a partition, according
to the respective rights of the parties, as ascertained
by the Court, and appoint three referees therefor; and
must designate the portion to remain undivided for
the owners whose interests remain unknown, or are not
ascertained.

§ 764. In making the partition, the referees
must divide the property and allot the several portions
thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity

in which they executed their trust, and describing

the property divided, and the shares allotted to each
party, with a particular description of each share.

§ 766. The Court may coniirm, change,
modify, or set aside the report, and, if necessary,
appoint new referees. Upon the report being confirmed, judgment must be rendered that such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is binding
and conclusive:

1. On all persons named as parties to the action, and
their legal representatives, who have at the time any
interest in the property divided, or any part thereof,
as owners in fee or as tenants for life or for years, or
as entitled to the reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of such property, or of any part thereof, after
the determination of a particular estate therein, and
who by any contingency may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who have an interest
in any undivided share thereof, as tenants for years or
for life.

2. On all persons interested in the property, who
may be unknown, to whom notice has been given of
the action for partition by publication;

3. On all other persons claiming from such parties
or persons, or either of them.

employed, must be ascertained and allowed by the

Court, and the amount thereof, together with the fees
allowed by the Court, in its discretion, to the referees,
must be apportioned among the different parties to
the action, equitably.

§ 769. When a lien is on an undivided
interest or estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a
partition be made, shall thenceforth be a charge only
on the share assigned to such party; but such share
must first be charged with its just proportion of the
costs of the partition, in preference to such lien.

§ 770. When a part of the property only
is ordered to be sold, if there be an estate for life or
years, in an undivided share of the whole property,
such estate may be set off in any part of the property
not ordered to be sold.

the Court, as follows:

1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of
the action; , ‘

2. To pay the costs of the reference; _

' 3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens
in their order of priority, by payment of the sums due
and to become due; the amount due to be verified by
aflidavit at the time of payment;

4. The residue among the owners of the property
sold, according to their respective shares therein.

§ 772. Whenever any party to an action,
who holds a lien upon the property, or any part thereof,
has other securities for the payment of the amount of
such lien, the Court may, in its discretion, order such
securities to be exhausted before a distribution of the
proceeds of sale, or may order a just deduction to be
made from the amount of the lien on the property, on
account thereof.

§ 773. The proceeds of sale and the securities taken by the referees, or any part thereof‘, must
be distributed by them to the persons entitled thereto,
whenever the Court so directs. But in case no direction be given, all of such proceeds and securities must
be paid into Court, or deposited therein, or as directed
by the Court.

§ 774. When the proceeds of the sale of
any share or parcel belonging to persons who are parties to the action, and who are known, are paid into
Court, the action may be continued as between such
parties, for the determination of their respective claims
thereto, which must be ascertained and adjudged by
the Court. Further testimony may be taken in Court,
or by a referee, at the discretion of the Court, and the
Court may, if necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by pleadings, as
in an original action.

such estate, and must order the same to be paid to
such party, or deposited in Court for him, as the case
may require.

estate for life or years be unknown, the Court must
provide for the protection of their rights in the same
manner, as far as may be, as if they were known and
had appeared.

that any person has a vested or contingent future right
or estate in any of the property sold, the Court must

ascertain and settle the proportional value of such contingent or vested right or estate, and must direct such
proportion of the proceeds of the sale to be invested,
secured, or paid over, in such manner as to protect
the rights and interests of the parties.

§ 782. In all cases of sales of property the
terms must be made known at the time; and if the
premises consist of distinct farms or lots, they must be

_ sold separately.

§ 783. Neither of the referees, nor any
person for the benefit of either of them, can be interested in any purchase; nor can a guardian of an
infant party be interested in the purchase of any real

such continuance. «

§ 1122. The Court must be governed, in the trial
and determination of such contested election, by the

2. If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the damages which
will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned,
by reason of its severance from the portion sought to
be condemned, and the construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff;

3. Separately, how much the portion not soughtto
be condemned, and each estate or interest therein, will
be benefited, if at all, by the _ construction of the
improvement proposed by the plaintiff; and if the
benefit shall be equal to the damages assessed, under Subdivision 2, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed

damages are allowed, as provided in Section 1248.
If an order be made letting the plaintiff into possession, as provided in Section 1254, the compensation

final judgment, pay the sum of money assessed; but
may, at the time of or before‘ payment, elect to build
the fences and cattle guards; and if he so elect, shall

approved by the Court in double the assessed costof
the same, to build such fences and cattle guards within

pay the cost of such fences and cattle guard. In an
action on such bond the plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney’s fees.

§ 1252. Payment may be made to the defendants
entitled thereto, or the money may be deposited in

Court may authorize the plaintiff, if already in possession, to continue therein, and if not, then to take
possession of and use the property during the pendency
and until the final conclusion of such proceedings, and
may stay all actions and proceedings against the plaintiff on account thereof; but the plaintiff must give
security, to be approved by such Court or Judge, to
pay as well the compensation in that behalf, when

ascertained, as all damages which may be sustained
by the defendant, if for any cause the property shall
not be finally taken for public use.

§ 1255. Costs may be allowed or not, and if allowed,
may be apportioned between the parties on the same
or adverse sides, in the discretion of the Court.

are inconsistent with the provisions of this Title, apply
to the proceedings mentioned in this Title.

§ 1258. With relation to the Acts passed at the
present session of the Legislature, this Title must be

executor, for thirty days after he has knowledge of the
death of the testator, and that he is named as executor, fails to petition the proper Court for the probate
of the will, and that letters testamentary be issued to
him, he may be held to have renounced his right to
letters, and the Court may appoint any other competent person administrator, unless good cause for delay
is shown.

§ 1302. If it is alleged in any petition
that any will is in the possession of a third person,

and the Court is satisfied that the allegation is correct, an order must be issued and served upon the
person having possession of the will, requiring him to

his ofiicial seal. Proof of the mailing of the notice

proof of service thereof on the person named as executor must be made, if he be not the petitioner; also, on
any person named as co-executor, not petitioning.

§ 1305. The Probate Judge may, out of
term time or at chambers, receive petitions for the
probate of wills, and make and issue all necessary

which the hearing may have been postponed, the Court
must require proof, by afiidavit, that the notices herein

to a day certain, and notice to absentees given thereof;
as original notice is required to be given. The appearance in Court of parties interested is a waiver of notice.

§ 1307. Any person interested may appear
and contest the Will. Devisces, legatees, heirs, or
creditors of .an estate may contest the will through
their guardians, or attorneys appointed by themselves
or by the Court for that purpose; but a contest made
by an attorney appointed by the Court does not bar a
contest after probate, by the party so. represented, if
commenced Within the time provided in Article IV
of this Chapter; nor does the non-appointment of an
attorney by the Court of itself invalidate the probate
of a will.

§ 1308. If no person appears to contest the
probate of a Will, the Court may admit it to probate

on the testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses
only, if he testifies that the will was executed in all

was of sound mind at the time of its execution.

§ 1309. An olographic will may be proved in the
same manner that other private writings are proved.

§ 1312. If any one appears to contest the
will, he must file written grounds of opposition to the
probate thereof, and serve a copy on the petitioner
and other residents of the county interested in the
estate, any one or more of whom may demur thereto

the sanity of the testator and the execution of the
will; and, as evidence of the execution, it may admit
proof of the handwriting of the testator and of the
subscribing witnesses, or any of them.

§ 1316. The testimony of each Witness, reduced to Writing and signed by him, shall be good

United States, or in any foreign country, and that it was
executed according to the law of the place in which the
same was made, or in which the testator was at the
time domiciled, or in conformity with the laws of this
State, it must be admitted to probate, and have the
same force and effect as a will first admitted to probate
in this State, and letters testamentary or of administration issued thereon.

annexed, must be issued thereon, in the same manner
as upon wills produced and duly proved.

of his administration within such time as the Court
shall direct.

§ 1424. In such case, the executor or the
administrator with the will annexed is entitled to
demand, sue for, recover, and collect all the rights,
goods, chattels, debts, and effects of the decedent
remaining unadministered, and may prosecute to final
judgment any suit commenced by the administrator
before the revocation of his letters of administration.

§ 1425. In case any one of several executors or administrators, to whom -letters are. granted,
dies, becomes lunatic, is convicted of an infamous
crime, or otherwise becomes incapable of executing
the trust; or in case the letters testamentary or of
administration are revoked or annulled, with respect
to any one executor or administrator, the remaining
executor or administrator must proceed to complete

. the execution of the will or administration.

§ 1426. If all such executors or administrators die or become incapable, or the power and
authority of all of them is revoked, the Probate Court
must issue letters of administration with the will
annexed, or otherwise, to the widow, or next of kin,
or others, in the same order and manner as is directed
in relation to original letters of administration. The
administrators so appointed must give bond in the like
penalty, with like sureties and conditions, as hereinbefore required of administrators, and shall have the
like power and authority.

§ 1427. Any executor or administrator
may, at any time, by writing, filed in the Probate
Court, resign his appointment, having first settled his
accounts and delivered up all the estate to the person

whom the Court shall appoint to receive the same.
If, however, by reason of any dela.ys in such settlement and delivering up of the estate, or for any other
cause, the circumstances of the estate or the rights of
those interested therein require it, the Court may, at
any time before settlement of accounts and delivering
up of the estate is completed, revoke the letters of
such executor or administrator, and appoint in his
stead an administrator, either special or general, in the
same manner as is directed in relation to original let

' ters of administration. The liability of the outgoing

executor or administrator, or of the sureties on his
bond, shall not be in any manner discharged, released,
or affected, by such appointment or resignation.

§ 1428. All acts of an executor or administrator, as such, before the revocation of his letters
testamentary or of administration, are as valid, to all
intents and purposes, as if such executor or administrator had continued lawfully to execute the duties of
his trust.

§ 1429. A transcript from the minutes of
the Court, showing the appointment of any person as
executor or administrator, together with the certificate
of the Clerk, under his hand and the seal of his Court,
that such person has given bond and been qualified,
and that letters testamentary or of administration have
been issued to him and have not been revoked, shall
have the same effect in evidence as the letters themselves. '

§ 1430. No Probate Court shall admit'to
probate any will, or grant letters testamentary or of
administration, in any case Where the Judge thereof
is interested as next of kin to the decedent, or as a
legatee or devisee under the Will, or when he is named
as executor or trustee in the will, or is a Witness

thereto, or is in any other manner interested or disqualified from acting.

§ 1431. When a petition is filed in the
Probate Court, praying for admission to probate of a
will, or for granting letters testamentary or of administration, or when proceedings are pending in the Probate Court for the settlement of an estate, and the
presiding Judge of the Court is disqualified to act
from any cause, upon his own or the motion of any
person interested in the estate, he must make an order
transferring the proceeding to the Probate Court of
an adjoining county; and the Clerk of the Court
ordering the transfer must transmit, to the Clerk of
the Court to which the proceeding is ordered to be
transferred, a certified copy of the order, and all the
papers on file in his oflice in the proceeding; and
thereafter the Probate Court to which the proceeding
is transferred shall exercise the same authority and
jurisdiction over the estate, and all matters relating to
the administration thereof, as if it had original jurisdiction of the Qtate.

§ 1432. The transfer of a proceeding from
one Court to another, as provided for in the preceding section, shall not affect the right of any person to letters testamentary or of administration on the estate
transferred, but the same persons are entitled to letters
testamentary or of administration on the estate in the

order hereinbefore provided. If, before the administration is closed of any estate so transferred, as herein
proyided, another person is elected or appointed, and
qualified, as Probate Judge of the county wherein such
proceeding was originally commenced, who is not dis
qualiiied to act in the settlement of the estate, and the
causes for which the proceeding was transferred no
longer exist, any person interested in the estate may
have the proceeding returned to the Court from which
it was originally transferred, by filing a petition setting
forth these facts, and moving the Court therefor.

§ 1433. On hearing the motion, if the facts
required by the preceding section to be set out in the
petition are satisfactorily shown, and it further appears
to the Court that the convenience of parties interested
would be promoted by such change, the Judge must
make an order transferring the proceeding back to
the Probate Court where it was originally commenced;
and the Clerk of the Court ordering the transfer must
transmit to the Clerk of the Court in which the proceeding was originally commenced a certified copy of
the order, and all the original papers on file in his oflice
in the proceeding; and the Court where the proceeding was originally commenced shall thereafter have.

jurisdiction and power to make all necessary orders
and decrees to close up the administration of the estate.

§ 1436. Whenever the Probate Judge has
reason to believe, from his own knowledge or from
credible information, that any executor or administrator has wasted, embezzled, or mismanaged, or is
about to waste or embezzle the property of the estate
committed to his charge, or has committed or is about
to commit a fraud upon the estate, or is incompetent
to act, or has permanently removed from the State, or
has wrongfully neglected the estate, or has long neglected to perform any act as such executor or administrator, he must, by an order entered upon the minutes
of the Court, suspend the powers of such executor or
administrator until the matter is investigated.

§ 1437. When such suspension is made,

notice thereof must be given to the executor or administrator, and he must be cited to appear and show cause
why his letters should not be revoked. If he fail to
appear in obedience to the citation, or, if appearing,
the Court is satisfied that there exists cause for his
removal, his letters must be revoked, and letters of
administration granted anew, as the case may require.

§ 1438. At the hearing, any person interested in the estate may appear and file his allegations
in writing, showing that the executor or administrator
should be removed; to which the executor or administrator may demur or answer, as hereinbefore provided.

The issues raised must be heard and determined by
the Court.

§ 1439. If the executor or administrator
has absconded or conceals himself, or has removed or
absented himself from the State, notice may be given
him of the pendency of the proceedings by publication, in such manner as the Court may direct, and the
Court may proceed upon such notice as if the citation
had been personally served.

§ 1440. In the proceedings authorized by

I the preceding sections of this Article, for the removal

of an executor or administrator, the Court may compel
his attendance by attachment, and may compel him to
answer questions, on oath, touching his administration,
and, upon his refusal so to do, may commit him until
he obey, or may revoke his letters, or both.

§ 1443. Every executor or administrator
must make and return to the Court, at its first term
after his appointment, a true inventory and appraisement of all the estate of the decedent, including the
homestead, if any, which has come to his possession
or knowledge.

§ 1444. To make the appraisement, the
Probate Judge or Court must appoint three disinterested persons (any two 'of Whom may act), who are
entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their
services, not to exceed five dollars per day, to be
allowed by the Court or Judge. The appraisers must,
with the inventory, file a verified account of their services and disbursements. If any part-of the estate is
in any other county than that in which letters issued,
appraisers thereof may be appointed, either by the
Probate Judge having jurisdiction of the estate or by
the Probate Judge of such other county, on request of
the Judge having jurisdiction.

§ 1445. Before proceeding to the execution of their duty, the appraisers, before any officer ,
authorized to administer oaths, 'must take and sub- A

scribe an oath, to be attached to the inventory, that
they will truly, honestly, and impartially appraise the
property exhibited to them, according to the best of
their knowledge and ability. They must then proceed
to estimate and appraise the property; each article
must be set down separately, with the value thereof
in dollars and cents, in figures, opposite to the articles respectively; the inventory must contain all the
estate of the decedent, real and personal, a statement
of all debts, partnerships, and other interests, bonds,
mortgages, notes, and other securities for the payment
of money belonging to the decedent, specifying ‘the
name of the debtor in each security, the date, the
sum originally payable, the indorsements thereon (if
any), with their dates, and the sum which, in the
judgment of the appraiser, may be collected on each

debt, interest, or security; the inventory must show,
so far as the same can be ascertained by the executor
or the administrator, what portion of the property is
community property and what portion is the separate
property of the decedent.

§ 1446. The inventory must also contain
an account of all moneys belonging to the decedent
which have come to the hands of the executor or
administrator, and if none, the fact must be so stated
in the inventory. If the Whole estate consists of
money, there need not be an appraisement, but an
inventory must be made and returned as in other
cases.

§ 1447. The naming of a person as executor does not thereby discharge him from any just
claim which the testator has against him, but the
claim must be included in the inventory, and the
executor is liable for the same, as for so much money
in his hands, when the debt or demand becomes due.

§ 1448. The discharge or bequest in a will,
of any debt or demand of the testator against the
executor named, or any other person, is not valid
against the creditors of the decedent, but is a specific
bequest of the debt or demand. It must be included
in the inventory, and, if necessary, applied in the payment of the debts. If not necessary for that purpose,
it must be paid in the same manner and proportion as
other specific legacies.

§ 1449. The inventory must be signed by
the appraisers, and the executor or administrator must
take and subscribe an oath before an oflicer authorized
to administer oaths, that the inventory contains a true
statement of all the estate of the decedent which has
come to his knowledge and possession, and particularly
of all money belonging to the decedent, and of all just

claims of the decedent against the atiiant. The oath
must be indorsed upon or annexed to the inventory.

§ 1450. If an executor or administrator
neglects or refuses to return the inventory within the
time prescribed, or within such further time, not exceeding two months, which the Court or Judge shall,
for reasonable cause, allow, the Court may, upon notice,
revoke the letters testamentary or of administration,
and the executor or administrator is liable on his bond
for any injury to the estate, or any person interested
therein, arising from such failure.

§ 1451. Whenever property not mentioned
in an inventory that is made and filed, comes to the
possession or knowledge of an executor or administrator, he must cause the same to be appraised in the
manner prescribed in this Article, and an inventory
thereof to be returned within two months after the
discovery; and the making of such inventory may be

enforced, after notice, by attachment or removal from
otiice.

§ 1452. The executor or administrator is
entitled to the possession of all the real and personal
estate of the decedent, and to receive the rents and
profits of the real estate, until the estate is settled, or
until delivered over by order of the Probate Court to
the heirs or devisees; and must keep in good tenantable repair all houses, buildings, and fixtures thereon,
which are under his control. The heirs or devisees
may themselves, or jointly with the executor or administrator, maintain an action for the possession of the
real estate, or for the purpose of quieting title to the
same, against any one except the executor or administrator.

§ 1453. Unless it satisfactorily appears to the Probate Court, that the rents, issues, and profits of the

real estate for a longer period, are necessary to be re.ceived by the executor or administrator, wherewith

to pay the debts of the decedent, or that it will probably be necessary to sell the real estate for the payment
of such debts, at the end of ten months from the
first publication of the notice to creditors, the Court
must direct the executor or administrator to deliver
possession of all the real estate to the heirs at law or

devisees.

§ 1458. If any person before the granting
of letters testamentary or of administration, embezzles or alienates any of the moneys, goods, chattels,
or effects of a decedent, he is chargeable therewith,
and liable to an action by the executor or administrator of the estate, for double the value of the property so embezzled or alienated, to be recovered for the

benefit of the estate.

§ 1459. If any executor, administrator, or
other person interested in the estate of a decedent,
complains to the Probate Judge, on oath, that any person is suspected to have concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any moneys,
goods, or chattels of the decedent, or has in his possession or knowledge, any deeds, conveyances, bonds,
contracts, or other Writings, which contain evidences
of, or tend to disclose the right, title, interest, or

claim of the decedent to any real or personal estate,
or any claim or demand, or any last will, the Judge
may cite such person to appear before the Probate
Court, and may examine him on oath upon thematter
of such complaint. If such person is not in the county
where letters have been granted, he may be cited and
examined, either before the Probate Court of the county
where he is found, or before the Court issuing the citation. But if in the latter case he appears and is found
innocent, his necessary expenses must be allowed him
out of the estate.

§ 1460. If the person so cited refuses to
appear and submit to an examination, or to answer
such interrogatories as may be put to him, touching
the matters of the complaint, the Court may, by warrant for that purpose, commit him to the County Jail,
there to remain in close custody until he submits to
the order of the Court or is discharged according to
law. If, upon such examination, it appears that he
has concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away,
or disposed of any moneys, goods, or chattels of the
decedent, or that he has in his possession or knowledge, any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or
other writings, tending to disclose the right, title,
interest, or claim of the decedent to any real or personal estate, claim, or demand, or any lost will of the
decedent, the Probate Court may make an order
requiring such person to disclose his knowledge thereof
to the executor or administrator, and may commit him
to the County Jail, there to remain until the order is
complied with or he is discharged according to law;
and all such interrogatories and answers must be in
Writing, signed by the party examined, and filed in
the Probate Court. The order for such disclosure,
made upon such examination, is primary evidence of

the right of such administrator to such property in

any action brought for the recovery thereof; and any
judgment recovered therein must be for double the
value of the property as assessed by the Court or jury,
or for return of the property, and damages in addion
thereto, equal to the value of such property. In addition to the examination of the party, witnesses may
be produced and examined on either side.

§ 1461. The Probate Judge, upon the complaint, on oath, of any executor or administrator, may

cite any person who has been entrusted with any part
of the estate of the decedent, to appear before such
Court, and require him to render a full account, on
oath, of any moneys, goods, chattels, bonds, accounts,
or other property or papers belonging to the estate,

. which have come to his possession in trust for the

executor or administrator, and of his proceedings
thereon; and if the person so cited refuses to appear
and render such account, the Court may proceed
against him as provided in the preceding section.

§ 1464. When a person dies leaving a

widow or minor children, the Widow or children, until

letters are granted and the inventory is returned, are
entitled to remain in possession of the homestead, of
all the wearing apparel of the family, and of all the
household furniture of the decedent, and are also entitled to a reasonable provision fdr their support, to be
allowed by the Probate Judge.

§ 1465. Upon the return of the inventory,
or at any subsequent time during the administration,
the Court or the Probate Judge may, on his own motion or on petition therefor, set apart for the use of
the surviving husband or Wife, or the minor children
of the decedent, all property exempt from execution,
including the homestead selected, designated, and recorded. If none has been selected, designated, and
recorded, the Judge or the Court must select, designate, set apart, and cause to be recorded, a homestead
for the use of the persons hereinbefore named, in the
manner provided in Article II of this Chapter, out of
the real estate belonging to the decedent.

§ 1466. If the amount set apart be insuflicient for the support of the Widow and children, or
either, the Probate Court or Judge must make such
reasonable allowance out of the estate as shall be necessary for the maintenance of the family, according to
their circumstances, during the progress of the settlement of the estate; which, in case of an insolvent.

estate, must not be longer than one year after granting
letters testamentary or of administration.

§ 1467. Any allowance made by the Court
or Judge, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, must be paid in preference to all other charges,
except funeral charges and expenses of administration;
and any such allowance, Whenever made, may, in the
discretion of the Court or Judge, take effect from the
death of the decedent.

§ 1468. When property is set apart for the
use of the family, in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter, if the decedent left a widow and no minor
child, such property is the property of the Widow. If
he left also a minor child or children, the one half of
such property shall belong to the widow and the
remainder to the child, or in equal shares to the children, if there are more than one. If there is no widow,
the whole belongs to the minor child or children.

§ 1469. If, on the return of the inventory
of the estate of an intestate, it appears that the value
of the whole estate does not exceed the sum of fifteen
hundred dollars, the Probate Court, by a decree for
that purpose, must assign for the use and support of
the widow and minor child or children, if there be a
Widow or minor child, and if no widow, then for the
children, if there are any,,the Whole of the estate, after
the payment of the expenses of his last illness, funeral
charges, and expenses of the administration, and there
must be no further proceedings in the administration
unless further estate be discovered; and when it so
appears that the value of the whole estate does not
exceed the sum of three thousand dollars, it is in the
discretion of the Probate Court to dispense with the
regular proceedings, or any part thereof‘, prescribed in
this Title, and there must be had a summary administration of the estate, and an order of distribution
thereof at the end of six months after the issuing of
letters; the notice to creditors must be given to present their claims within four months after the first
publication of such notice, and those not so presented
arebarred as in other cases.

§ 1470. If the widow has a maintenance
derived from her own property equal to the portion set
apart to her by the preceding sections of this Article,
the whole property so set apart, other than‘ her half of
the homestead, must go to the minor children.

§ 1474. The homestead selected by the busband and wife, or either of them, during their coverture, and recorded while both are living, on the death
of the husband or wife vests absolutely in the survivor,
and is not, nor is theproceeds of a sale thereof; subject to the payment of any debt or liability contracted
by or existing against the husband and wife, or either
of them, previous to or at the time of'the death of
such husband or wife, except such mortgage or lien as
the homestead was subject to at the time of the death
of such husband or wife. ’

§ 1475. If the homestead selected and
recorded prior to the death of the decedent is returned
in the inventory, appraised at not exceeding five thousand dollars in value, the Probate Court must, by order,
set it off to the persons in whom title is vested by the
preceding section. If there are subsisting liens or
incumbrances on the homestead, they must be paid
out of the funds of the estate, if there remain suf£cient for that purpose, after the payment of all claims
allowed against the estate.

§ 1476. If the homestead, as selected and recorded,
‘is appraised at, more than iive thousand dollars, the

appraisers must, before they make their return, adxmeasure and set apart such portion of the original
homestead, including the residence, or such portion of
the residence as does not exceed five thousand dollars
in value, and make report thereof, giving the metes,
bounds, and full description of the property and
appurtenances by them set apart as a homestead; the
appraisers must, at the same time, repoit the value of
the entire house, if they have partitioned it; also, the
house and the largest portion of the immediately adjacent land and buildings, which, together, do not exceed
five thousand dollars in value.

§ 1477. Any two of the appraisers concurring may
discharge the duties imposed upon the three, and
make the report. A dissenting report may be made
by the third appraiser. The report must state fully
the acts of the appraisers. Both reports may be heard
and considered by the Court in determining a confirmation or rejection of the majority report, but the
minority report must in no case be confirmed.

§ 1478. When the report of the appraisers is filed,
the Court must set a. day for hearing any objections
thereto, from any one interested in the estate: There
must be given the same notice thereof as is required
in Article I, Chapter II, of the probate of a Will. The
objections must be in Writing, and, together with such
witnesses as may be produced for and against the report, be heard by the Court. If the Court is satisfied
that the appraisement, or the partition and appraisement, was fairly and honestly conducted and made, the
report, appraisement, and partition must be confirmed;
if not, rejected.

§ 1479. If the report is rejected, and no appeal is
taken therefrom, or if from any cause the first appraisers fail to make the‘ required report, the Court must
appoint three disinterested householders, residents of
the county, to appraise and admeasure the homestead,
who must be sworn thereto, perform the duties and
make report thereof; and the same proceedings for the
confirmation or rejection thereof must be had as provided in the two preceding sections. If the report is
again rejected, and no appeal is taken, the Court must
direct the homestead claimant to bring action for partition of the homestead, in the District Court, and
must set apart the homestead as directed by the District Court.

§ 1480. Instead of dividing a house or the land
embraced in the homestead selected and recorded,

the person entitled to the homestead by descent has
the right to pay to the estate the excess of value at
which the same is appraised over five thousand dollars, and the Court must make an order directing the
executor or administrator to execute a deed therefor,
conveying to him all the interest of the’ estate therein.
If the claimant declines to make such payment, and
prefers receiving the value of the homestead’ rather
than a partition between him and the estate, any of
the heirs or devisees may pay the appraised value and
take a deed from the estate and’ the homestead claimant. Five thousand dollars of the purchase money
must be paid by order of the Court, to the person
entitled to the homestead.

§ 1481. If no homestead is selected, designated, and
recorded prior to the death of the decedent, any of the
persons named in Section 1474, entitled to succeed
to a homestead, may petition the Probate Court to
admeasure, appraise, and set apart to them a homestead, from the real estate belonging to the decedent. The petition must set forth the name of the
petitioner, his relation to decedent, the land from
which it is desired to make the selection, the portion
thereof selected, and its estimated value, and whether
the same is community or separate property “of the
decedent, or owned by decedent as joint tenant or
tenant in common.

§ 1482. If the land from which the selection of the
homestead is to be made, is owned by the decedent as
joint tenant or tenant in common, the Probate Court
must so order, and the executor or administrator must
proceed to have partition thereof made by action in
the District Court, as provided in this Code; and when
partition is so made and certified to the Probate Court,
the Probate Court must, if the portion set apart tothe
estate does not exceed live thousand dollars in value,

set the same apart to the claimant, if entitled thereto,
and cause the same to be recorded; or,‘ if a sale is bad
of the land by decree of the District or Probate Court,
the proceeds of the sale belonging to the estate, not

exceeding five thousand dollars, must be paid to such
claimant. ‘

§ 1483. If the land and appurtenances from which
the selection of a homestead is sought, is community
or separate property of the decedent, on filing the
petition the Court must appoint appraisers, and cause
the same to be admeasured, appraised, reported, and
confirmed or rejected, as provided in the preceding sections of this Article.

§ 1484. If it is made to appear to the Probate Court
that any appraisement of property, constituting the
homestead, or from which it is claimed, is either too
high or too low, or is unfairly or fraudulently made,
the appraisement, by order of the Court, must be
annulled and another had, as provided in this Article
in case of rejection of a report. Instead of allowing
the homestead claimant, or other heirs or devisees, to
take the property in this section before mentioned, at
its appraised value, as provided in Section 1480, the
Court may, in its discretion, or on petition, direct a
sale thereof to be had at public auction, after notice of
sale given as provided for sales of real estate of a
decedent in the course of administration, for the payment of debts or legacies. If more than five thousand
dollars is not bid, no sale shall take place, but on
report of the facts the property must be set apart as a
homestead.

§ 1485. The costs of all proceedings in the Probate
Court, provided for in this Chapter, must be paid by
the estate, as expenses of administration. Persons
succeeding by purchase or otherwise to the interests,

rights, and title of successors to homesteads, or tothe
right to have homesteads set apart to them, as in this Chapter provided, have all the rights and benefits
conferred by law on the persons whose interests and
rights they acquire.

§ 1486. A certified copy of every final order made
in pursuance of this Article, by which a report is coniirmed, property assigned, or sale connrmed, must be
recorded in the ofiiee of the Recorder of the county
where the homestead property is situated.

§ 1490. Every executor or administrator 
must, immediately after his appointment, cause to be
published in some newspaper of the county, if there
be one, if not, then in such newspaper as may be
designated by the Court, a notice to the creditors of
the decedent, requiring all persons having claims
against him to exhibit them, with the necessary
vouchers, to the executor or administrator, at the
place of his residence or business, to be specified in
the notice. Such notice must be published as often
as the Judge or Court shall direct, but not less than
once a week for four weeks. The Court or Judge 1
may also direct additional notice by publication or
posting. In case such executor or administrator resigns, or is removed, before the time expressed in the
notice, his successor must give notice only for the
unexpired time allowed for such presentation.

§ 1491. The time expressed in the notice
must be ten months after its iirst publication, when the
estate exceeds in value the sum of ten thousand dollars, and four months when it does not.

§ 1492. After the notice is given, ‘as required by the preceding section, a copy thereof, with
the afiidavit of due publication, or of publication and
posting, must be filed, and upon such affidavit or other
testimony to the satisfaction of the Court, an order or
decree showing that due notice to creditors has been
given, and directing that such order or decree be
entered in the minutes and recorded, must be made
by the Court.

§ 1493. If a claim is not presented within
the time limited in the notice, it is barred forever,
except as follows: If it is not then due, or if it is

contingent, it may be presented within one month after
it becomes due or absolute; when it is made to appear
by the ailidavit of the claimant, to the satisfaction of
the executor or administrator and the Probate Judge,
that the claimant had no notice, as provided in this Chapter, by reason of being out of the State, it may
be presented any time before a decree of distribution
is entered; a claim for a deficiency remaining unpaid
alter a sale of property of the estate mortgaged or
pledged must be presented within one month after such
deiiciency is ascertained.

§ 1494. Every claim presented to the administrator must be supported by the afiidavit of the
claimant, or some one in his behalf, that the amount is
justly due, that no payments have been made thereon
which are not credited, and that there are no offsets
to the same, to the knowledge of the claimant or
afiiant. When the ailidavit is made by a person other
than the claimant, he must set forth in the afiidavit
the reasons why it is not made by the claimant. The
oath may be taken before any oflicer authorized to
administer oaths. The executor or administrator may
also require satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be produced in support of the claim. If the estate is insolvent,,;1o greater rate of interest shall be allowed upon
any claimfafter the first publication of notice to creditors, than is allowed on judgments obtained in the
District Court.

Probate Judge as shall have acted upon it, has the
same right to sue in a proper Court for its recovery as
other persons have when their claims against an estate

are rejected.


§ 1496. When a claim, accompanied by

the affidavit required in this Chapter, is presented to i

the executor or administrator, he must indorse thereon
his allowance or rejection, with the day and date
thereof. If he allows the claim, it must be presented
to the Probate Judge for his approval, who must, in
the same manner, indorse upon it his allowance or
rejection. If the executor or administrator, or the
Judge, refuse or neglect to indorse such allowance or
rejection for ten days after the claim has been presented to him, such refusal or neglect is equivalent to
a rejection; and if the presentation he made by a
Notary, the certiiicate of such Notary, under seal, is
primary evidence of such presentation and rejection.
If the claim be presented to the executor or administrator, before the expiration of the time limited for
the presentation of claims, the same is presented in
time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator, and by the Judge, after the expiration of such
time.

§ 1497. Every claim allowed by the executor or administrator, and approved by the Probate
Judge, or a copy thereof, as hereinafter provided, must,
Within thirty days thereafter, be filed in the Probate
Court, and be ranked among the acknowledged debts
of the estate, to be paid in due course of administration. If the claim is founded on a bond, bill, note, or
any other instrument, a copy of such instrument must
accompany the claim, and the original instrument must
be exhibited if demanded, unless it is lost or destroyed,
in which case the claimant must accompany his claim
by his afiidavit, containing a copy or particular description of such instrument, and stating its loss or’destruction. If the claim or any part thereof is secured by a
mortgage or other lien which has been recorded in the
ofiice of the Recorder of the county in which the land
affected by it lies, it is sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien, and refer to the date, volume, and page
of its record. If, in any case, the claimant has left any
original voucher in the hands of the executor or administrator, or suffered the same to be filed in Court, he
may withdraw the same when a copy thereof has been
already, or is then, attached to his claim. A brief
description of every claim tiled must be entered by
the Clerk in the register, showing the name of the
claimant, the amount and character of the claim, rate
of interest, and date of allowance.

§ 1498. When a claim is rejected, either
by the executor or administrator, or the Probate Judge,
the holder must bring suit in the proper Court against
the executor or administrator, within three months
after the date of its rejection, if it be then due, or
within two months after it becomes due, otherwise the
claim is forever barred.


§ 1499. No claim must be allowed by the
executor or administrator, or by the Probate Judge,
which is barred by the Statute of Limitations. When
a claim is presented to the Probate Judge for his allowance, he may, in his discretion, examine the claimant
and others, on oath, and hear any other legal evidence
touching the validity of the claim.

§ 1500. No holder of any claim against
an estate shall maintain anyaction thereon, unless the
claim is first presented to the executor or administrator, except in the following case: an action may be
brought by any holder of a mortgage or lien to enforce the same against the property of the estate
subject thereto, where all recourse against any other

property of the estate is expressly waived in the complaint.


§ 1501. The time during which there
shall be a vacancy in the administration must not be
included in any limitations herein prescribed.

§ 1502. If an action is pending against
the decedent at the time of his death, the plaintiff
must in like manner present his claim to the executor
or administrator, for allowance or rejection, authenticated as required in other cases; and no recovery shall

be had in the action unless proof be made of the presentations required.

§ 1503. VVhenever any claim is presented
to an executor or administrator, or to the Probate
Judge, and he is willing to allow the same in part, he
must state in his indorsement the amount he is willing
to allow. If the creditor refuse to accept the amount
allowed in satisfaction of his claim, he shall recover
no costs in any action therefor, brought against the
executor or administrator, unless he recovers a greater
amount than that. offered to be allowed.


§ 1504. A judgment renderedagainst an
executor or administrator, upon any claim for money
against the estate of his testator or intestate, only
establishes the claim in the same manner as if it had
been allowed by the executor or administrator and the executor or administrator pay in due course of administration the amount ascertained to be due. A certified transcript of the judgment must be filed in the Probate Court. No execution must issue upon such judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property of the estate or give to the judgment creditor any priority of payment.

§ 1505. When any judgment has been rendered for or against the testator or intestate in his lifetime, no execution shall issue thereon after his death, except as provided in Section 686; a judgment against the decedent for the recovery of money, must be presented to the executor or administrator, like any other claim. IF the execution is actually levied upon any property of the decedent before his death, the same may be sold for the satisfaction thereof, and the officer making the sale must accoutn to the executor or administrator for any surplus in his hands.

§ 1506. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying after verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment is rendered thereon, is not a lien on teh real property of the decedent, but is payable in due course of administration.

§ 1507. If the executor or administrator
doubts the correctness of any claim presented to him,
he may enter into an agreement, in writing, with the
claimant, to refer the matter in controversy to some’
disinterested person, to be approved by the Probate
Judge. Upon filing the agreement and approval of
the Probate Judge in the office of the Clerk of the
District Court for the county in which the letters testamentary or of administration were granted, the Clerk
must, either in vacation or in term, enter a minute
of the order referring the matter in controversy to

.the person so selected; or, if the parties consent, a

reference may be had in the Probate Court; and the
report of the referee, if confirmed, establishes or rejects the claim, the same as if it had been allowed or
rejected by the executor or administrator and the
Probate Judge.

§ 1508. The referee must bear and determine the matter, and make his report thereon to the
Court in which his appointment is entered. The same
proceedings shall be had in all respects, and the referee
shall have the same powers, be emhb¢ 
compensation and subject to the same control, as in
other cases of reference. The Court may remove the
referee, appoint another in his place, set aside or confirm his report, and adjudge costs, as in actions against
executors or administrators, and the judgment of the
Court thereon shall be as valid and effectual, in all
respects, as if the same had been rendered in a suit
commenced by ordinary process.

§ 1509. When a judgment is recovered,
with costs, against any executor or administrator, he

shall be individually liable for such costs, but they
must be allowed him in his administration accounts,
unless it appears that the suit or proceeding in which
the costs were taxed was prosecuted or defended without just cause.

§ 1510. If the executor or administrator is
a creditor of the decedent, his claim, duly authenticated by aiiidavits, must be presented for allowance or
rejection to the Probate Judge, and its allowance by
the Judge is suiiicient evidence of its correctness, and
it must be paid as other claims, in due course of administration. If, however, the Probate Judge rejects the
claim, action thereon may be had against the estate
by the claimant, and summons must be served upon
the Probate Judge, who may appoint an attorney at
the expense of the estate, to defend the action. If
the claimant recovers no judgment he must pay all
costs, including defendant’s attorney’s fees.

§ 1511. If an executor or administrator

' neglects for two months after his appointment to give

notice to creditors, as prescribed by this Chapter, the
Court must revoke his letters, and appoint some other
person in his stead, equally or the next in order entitled to the appointment.

§ 1512. At the same term at which he is
required to return his inventory, the executor or administrator must also return a statement of all claims
against the estate which have been presented to him,
if so required by the Court; and from term to term
thereafter he must present a statement of claims sub
sequently presented to him. In all such statements he
must designate the names of the creditors, the nature
of each claim, when it became due or will become due,
and whether it was allowed or rejected by him.


§ 1516. The personal estate of the decedent which comes into the hands of the executor or
administrator is first chargeable with the payment of
the debts and expenses; if the goods, chattels, rights,
and credits in the hands of the executoror administrator are not sufficient to pay the debts of the decedent, the expenses of administrati/on, and the allowance
to the family, the whole of the real estate may be sold
for that purpose by the executor or administrator, in
the manner prescribed in Chapter VII of this Title.

§ 1517. No sale of any property of an
estate of a decedent is valid unless made under order
of the Probate Court, except as otherwise provided in
this Chapter. All sales must be reported under oath,
and confirmed by the Probate Court, before the title
to the property sold passes.

§ 1518. All petitions for orders of sale
must be in writing, setting forth the facts showing the
sale to be necessary, and upon the hearing any person

interested in the estate may tile his written objections,
which must be heard and determined.

§ 1519. When it can be made to appear to the Court
that the estate is insolvent, or that it will require a
sale of all the property of the estate, of every character, to pay the family allowance, expenses of administration, and debts, there must be but one petition filed,
but one order of sale made, and but one sale had.
The Probate Court, when a petition for the sale of any
property for any of the purposes herein named is presented, must inquire fully into the probable amount
required to make all such payments, and if there is no
more estate than sufiicient to pay the same, must
require but one proceeding for the sale of the entire
estate. In such case, the petition must set forth all
the facts required by Section 1537.


§ 1522. At any time after receiving letters, the executor, administrator, or special administrator may apply to the Court or Judge and obtain an
order to sell perishable and other personal property
likely to depreciate in value, or which will incur loss
or expense by being kept, and so much other personal
property as may be necessary to pay the allowance
made to the family of the decedent. The order for
the sale may be made Without notice; but the executor, administrator, or special administrator is responsible for the property, unless, after making a sworn

return, and on a proper showing, the Court shall
approve the sale.

§ 1523. If claims against the estate have
been allowed, and a sale of property 18 necessary for
their payment or the expenses of administration, the
executor or administrator may apply for an order to
sell so much of the personal property as may be necessary therefor. Upon filing his petition, notice of at
least five days must be given of the hearing of the
application, either by posting notices or by advertising. _He may also make a similar application, either
in vacation or term, from time to time, so long as any
personal property remains in his hands and sale thereof
is necessary. If it is made to appear for the best
interest of the estate, he may, at any time after filing
the inventory, in like manner and after giving like
notice, apply for and obtain an order to sell the whole
of the personal property belonging to the estate,
whether necessary to pay debts or not.

§ 1524. Partnership interests or interests belonging
to‘ any estate by virtue of any partnership formerly
existing, interest in personal property pledged, and
choses in action, may be sold in the same manner as
other personal property, when it appears to be for the
best interest of the estate. Before confirming the sale
of any partnership interest, whether made to the surviving partner or to any other person, the Court or

Judge must ‘carefully inquire into the condition of the.

partnership affairs, and must examine the surviving
partner, if in the county and able to be present in

Court.

§ 1525. If it appears that a sale is necessary for the payment of debts or the family allowance,
or for the best interest of the estate and the persons

interested in the property to be sold, whether it is or
is not necessary to pay the debts or family allowance,
the Court or Judge must order it to be made. In
making orders and sales for the payment of debts or
family allowance, the Court or Judge must so direct;
and such articles as are not necessary for the support
and subsistence of the family of the decedent, or are
not specially bequeathed, must be iirst sold. Articles
bequeathed must not be sold to pay ‘debts or family
allowance, until all other personal estate has been
applied to the payment thereof.

§ 1526. The sale of personal property must be made at public auction, and after public
notice, given for at least ten days, by notices posted
in three public places in the county, or by publication
in a newspaper, or both, containing the time and place
of sale, and a brief description of the property to be

sold; unless, for good reason shown, the Probate Court _

or Judge orders a private sale, or a shorter notice.
Public sales of such property must be made at the
Court House door, at the residence of the decedent,
or at some other public place; but no sale shall be
made of any property which is not present at the time
of selling it, unless the Court otherwise order.

§ 1529. When it appears from the inventory of the
estate of any decedent that his estate consists in whole
or in part of mines or interests in mines, such mines

or interests may be sold under the order of the Probate Court having jurisdiction of the estate, as hereinafter provided.

§ 1530. The executor, administrator, or
any heir at law, or creditor of the estate, any partner
or member of any mining company in which interests
or shares are held or owned by the estate, may file in
the Probate Court a petition in writing, setting forth
the general facts of the estate being then in due course
of administration, and particularly describing the mine,
interest, or shares which it is desired to sell, and particularly the condition and situation of the mines or
mining interests, or of the mining company in which
such interests or shares are held, and the grounds upon
which the sale is asked to be made. i

§ 1531. Upon the presentation of such peti_ tion the Probate Judge must make an order directing

all persons interested to appear before him at a time
and place specified, not less than four nor more than
ten weeks from the time of making such order, to
show cause why an order should not be granted to the
executor or administrator to sell such mines, mining
interests, shares, or stocks, as are setuforth in the petition and belonging to the estate. A copy of the order
to show cause must be personally served on all persons
interested in the estate, at least ten days before the
time appointed for hearing the petition, or published
at least four successive weeks in such newspaper as the
Court shall specify. If all persons interested in the
estate signify in writing their assent to such sale, the
notice may be dispensed with.

§ 1532. If, upon hearing the petition, it
appears to the satisfaction of the Probate Judge that
it is to the interest of the estate that such mining
property or interests of the estate should be sold, or if

it appears to his satisfaction that an immediate sale is
necessary in order to secure the just rights or interests
of the mining partners, or tenants in common, in which
such shares or property are held, such Probate Judge
must make an order authorizing the executor or administrator to sell such mining interests, mines, or shares,
as hereinafter provided.

§ 1533. After the order of sale is made, all

further proceedings for the sale of such mining property, and for the notice, report, and confirmation thereof,

must be in conformity with the provisions of Article
IV of this Chapter.


§ 1536. When the personal estate in the
hands of the executor or administrator is exhausted or
insufiicient to pay the allowance of the family, the
debts outstanding against the decedent, and the debts,
expenses, and charges of administration, the executor
or administrator may sell the real estate for that purpose, upon the order of the Probate Court.

§ 1537. To obtain such order he must
present a verified petition to the Probate Court, or to
the Judge at chambers, setting forth the amount of
personal estate that has come to his hands, and how
much thereof, if any, remains undisposed of; the debts
outstanding against the decedent, as far as can be
ascertained or estimated; the amount due upon the
family allowance, or that will be due after the same

has been in force for one year; the debts, expenses,
and charges of administration already accrued, and an
estimate of What will or may accrue during the administration; a description of all the real estate of
Which the decedent died seized, or in which he had
any interest, or in which the estate has acquired any
interest, and the condition and value of the respective
portions and lots thereof, and whether the same be
community or separate property; the names and ages
of the devisees, if any, and of the heirs of the decedent. If all the matters above enumerated cannot
be ascertained, it must be so stated in the petition.

§ 1538. If it appears to the Court or Judge,
from such petition, that it is necessary to sell the whole
or some portion of the real estate for the purposes and
reasons mentioned in the preceding section, or any of
them, such petition must be filed and an order thereupon made, directing all persons interested in the
estate to appear before the Court, at a time and place
speciiied, not less than four nor more than ten Weeks
from the time of making such order, to show cause
why an order should not be granted to the executor or
administrator to sell so much of the real estate of the

decedent as is necessary.

§ 1539. A copy of the order to show
cause must be personally served on all persons interested in the estate, and on any general guardian of any
minor, devisee, or heir of the decedent resident in the
county, at least ten days before the time appointed for
hearing the petition, or must be published at least
four successive weeks in such newspaper as the Court
or Judge shall direct. The notice is served if the
publication is completed ten days before the day set for
hearing. If all persons_interested in the estate join in
the petition for the sale, or signify in Writing their
assent thereto, the notice may be dispensed With.

§ 1540. The Probate Court, at the time 1
and place appointed in such order, or at such other A

time to which the hearing may be postponed, upon
satisfactory proof of personal service or publication of
a copy of the order, by affidavit or otherwise, if the
consent, in Writing, to such sale of all parties interested is not filed, must proceed to hear the petition,’
and hear and examine the allegations and proofs of
the petitioners, and of all persons interested in the

estate who may oppose the application. All claims ,

against the decedent not before presented, if the

period of presentation has not elapsed, ‘may be presented and passed upon at the hearing.

§ 1541. The executor, administrator, and
witnesses may be examined on oath by either party,
and process to compel them to attend and testify may
be issued by the Probate Judge, in the same manner
and with like effect as in other cases. ‘

§ 1542. If it appears necessary to sell a
part of the real estate, and that by a sale thereof the
residue of the estate, real or personal, or some specific
part thereof‘, would be greatly injured or diminished
in value, or subjected to expense, or rendered unprofitable, or that after any such sale the residue Would
be so small in quantity or value, or would be of such
a character with reference to its future disposition
among the heirs or devisees, as clearly to render it
for the best interests of all concerned that the same
should be sold, the Court may authorize the sale of
the whole estate, or of any part thereof, necessary and
for the best interest of all concerned. '

§ 1543. If the Court is satisfied, after afull
bearing’ upon the petition and an examination of the
proofs and allegations of the parties interested, that a
sale of the whole or some portion of the real estate is

necessary, for any of the causes mentioned in this Article, or if such sale be assented to by all the persons
interested, an order must be made to sell the whole,or
so much and such parts of the real estate described
in the petition, as the Court shall judge necessary or
beneficial.

§ 1544. The order of sale must describe
the lands to be sold and the terms of sale, which may
be for cash, or on a credit not exceeding one year,
payable in gross or in installments, and in such kind of
money, with interest, as the Court may direct. The
land may be sold in one parcel or in subdivisions, as
the executor or administrator shall judge most beneficial to the estate, unless the Court otherwise specially
directs. If it appears that any part of such real estate
has been devised and not charged in such devise with
the payment of debts or legacies, the Court must order
the remainder to be sold before that so devised.
Every such sale must be ordered to be made at public
auction, unless, in the opinion of the Court, it would
benefit the estate to sell the Whole or some part of
such real estate at private sale; the Court may, if the
same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such
real estate or any part thereof to be sold at either public or private sale, as the executor or administrator
shall judge to be most beneficial for theestate. It
the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to
make a sale under the order and as directed therein,
he may be compelled to sell, by order of the Court,
made on motion, after due notice, by any party interested.

§ 1545. If the executor or administrator
neglects to apply for an order of sale when it is necessary, any person may make application therefor, in the
same manner as the executor or administrator, and
notice thereof must be given to the executor or administrator, before the hearing. The petition of such
applicant must contain as many of the matters set
forth in Section 1537 as he can ascertain, and the
decree of sale mustfix the period of time within which
the executor or administrator must make the sale.

§ 1546. Upon making the order mentioned
in the last section, a certified copy of the order of sale
must be delivered by the Court or the Clerk to the
executor or administrator, who is thereupon authorized and required to sell the real estate as directed.

be made at public auction, notice of the time and
place of sale must be posted in three of the most pubhe places in the county in which the land is situated,
and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed

as the Court may direct, for three weeks successively
next before the sale. The lands and tenements to be
sold must be described with common certainty in the
notice.

§ 1548. Sales at public auction must be
made in the county where the land is situated; but
when the land is situated in two’ or more counties, it
may be sold in either. The sale must be made between
the hours of nine o’clock in the morning and the setting of the sun on the same day, and must be made on
the day named in the notice of sale, unless the same
is postponed.

§ 1549. When a sale of real estate is ordered
to be made at private sale, notice of the same must be
posted up in three of the most public places in the
county in which the land is situated, and published in
a newspaper, if there be one printed in the same
county—if none, then in such paper as the Court may

direct—-for tW'0 Weeks successively next before the day
on or after which the sale is to be made, in which the
lands and tenements to be sold must be described with
common certainty. ’ The notice must state a day on or
after which the sale Will be made, and a place where
offers or bids will be received. The day last referred
to must be at least fifteen days from the first publication _of notice, and the sale must not be made before
that day, but must be made within six months thereafter. The bids or offers must be in Writing, and may‘

be left at the place designated in the notice, or delivered to the executor or administrator personally, or may
be filed in the oiiiee of the Clerk of the Probate Court,
to which the return of sale must be made, at any time
after the first publication of the notice, and before the

‘making of the sale. If it is shown that it Will be for

the best interest of the estate, the Court or Judge
may, by an order, shorten the time of notice, which
shall not, however, be less than one Week, and may
provide that the sale may be made on or after a day
less than fifteen, but not less than eight, days from the
first publication of the notice, in which case the notice
of sale and the sale may be made to correspond with
such order.

§ 1550. No sale of real estate at private
sale shall be confirmed bythe Court, unless the sum
offered is at least ninety per cent of the appraised value
thereof, nor unless such real estate has been appraised
within one year of the time of such sale. If it has not
been so appraised, or if the Court is satisfied that the
appraisement is too high or too low, appraisers must be
appointed, and they must make an appraisement thereof
in the same manner as in case of an original appraisement of an estate. This may be done at any time
before the sale or the confirmation thereof.

§ 1551. The executor or administrator
must, when the sale is made upon a credit, take the
notes of the purchaser for the purchase money, with a
mortgage on the property to secure their payment.

§ 1552. The executor or administrator,
after making any sale of real estate, must make a
return of his proceedings to the Probate Court, which
must be filed in the oiiice of the Clerk, at any time
subsequent to the sale, either in term or vacation. If
the sale is made at public auction, and the return is
made and filed on or before the first day of the ‘next
term thereafter, no notice is required of such return
or of the hearing thereof‘, but the hearing may be
had upon the first day of the term, or any subsequent
day to which the same may be postponed. If the
sale be not made at public auction, or if made at public auction a hearing upon the return of proceedings
be asked for in the return, or is brought on for a hearing upon a day before the first day of the next term
thereafter, or upon any other day than the iirst day of
the next term after such sale, the Court or Judge
must fix the day for the hearing, of which notice of at
least ten days must be given by the Clerk, by notices
posted in three public places in the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both, as the Court or Judge
shall direct, and must briefly indicate the land sold,
the sum for which it was sold, and must refer to the
return for further particulars. Upon the hearing, the
Court must examine the return and witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings were unfair,
or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and if it
appear that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per
cent, exclusive of the expenses of a, new sale, may be
obtained, the Court may vacate the sale and direct
another to be had, of which notice must be given, and
the sale in all respects conducted as if no previous sale
had taken place ;.if an offer ten per cent more in

amount than that named in the return be made to the
Court in Writing, by a responsible person, it is in the
discretion of the Court to accept such offer and confirm the sale to such person or to order a new sale.

§ 1553. When return of the sale is made
and filed any person interested in the estate may file
written objections to the confirmation thereof; and
may be heard thereon, when the return is heard by
the Court or Judge, and may produce Witnesses in
support of his objections.

§ 1554. If it appears to the Court that the

A sale was legally made and fairly conducted, and that

the sum bid was not disproportionate to the value ot
the property sold, and that a greater sum, as above
specified, cannot be obtained, or if the increased bid
mentioned in Section 1552 be made and accepted by
the Court, the Court must make an order confirming
the sale, and directing conveyances to be executed.
The sale, from that time, is confirmed and valid, and
a certified copy of the order confirming it and directing conveyances to be executed must be recorded in
the ofiice of the Recorder of the county within which
the land sold is situated. If, after the confirmation,
the purchaser neglects or refuses to comply with
the terms of sale, the Court may, on motion of the
executor or administrator, and after notice to the purchaser, order a resale to be made of the property. If
the amount realized on such resale does not cover the
bid and the expenses of the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the deficiency to the estate.

§ 1555. Conveyances must thereupon be
executed to the purchaser by the executor or administrator, and they must refer to the orders of the Probate Court authorizing and confirming the sale of the
property of the estate, and directing conveyances

thereof to be executed, and to the record of the order
of confirmation in the oflice of the County Recorder,
either by the date of such recording, or by the date,
volume, and page of the record, and such reference
shall have the same effect as if the orders were, at
large, inserted in the conveyance. Conveyances so
made convey all the right, title, interest, and estate of
the decedent, in the premises, at the time of his death;
if, prior to the sale, by operation of law or otherwise,
the estate has acquired any right, title, or interest in
the premises, other than, or in addition to, that of the
decedent at the time of his death, such right, title, or
interest also passes by such conveyances.

§ 1556. Before any order is entered confirming the sale, it must be proved to the satisfaction
of the Court that notice was given of the sale as prescribed, and the order of confirmation must show that
such proof was made.

§ 1557. If at the time appointed for the
sale, the executor or administrator deems it for the
interest of all persons concerned therein that the same
be postponed, he may postpone it from time to time,
not exceeding in all three months.

§ 1558. In case of a postponement, notice
thereof must be given, by a public declaration, at the
time and place iirst appointed for the sale, and if the
postponement be for more than one day, further notice
must be given, by posting notices in three or more
public places in the county where the land is situated,
or publishing the same, or both, as the time and circumstances will admit.

§ 1559. When a testator has given any
legacy by will that is effectual to pass or charge the title to real estate, and his goods, chattels, rights, and
credits are insufficient to pay the legacy, together with

his debts and the charges of administration, the executor or administrator with the will annexed may obtain
an order therefor, and sell his real estate for that purpose, in the same manner and upon the same terms and
conditions as are prescribed in this Chapter in case of
a sale for the payment of debts.

§ 1560. If the testator makes provision by
his will, or designates the estate to be appropriated for
the payment of his debts, the expenses of administra»
tion, or family expenses, they must be paid according
to such provision or designation, out of the estate thus
appropriated, so far as the same is suilicient.

§ 1561. When such provision has been
made, or any property directed by the will to be sold,
the executor or administrator With the will annexed,
may sell, Without the order of the Probate Court, but
he must give notice of the sale, return accounts thereof
to the Court, and make the sale in all respects as under
order of the Court, unless there are special directions in
the will, in which case he must be governed thereby.

§ 1562. If the provision made by the Will,
or the estate appropriated therefor, is insufficient to
pay the debts, expenses of administration, and family
expenses, that portion of the estate not devised or disposed of by the will, if any, must be appropriated and
disposed of for that purpose, according to the provisions of this Chapter.

§ 1563. The estate, real and personal, given
by will to legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts,
expenses of administration, and family expenses, in
proportion to the value or amount of the several devises or legacies, but’ specific devises or legacies are
exempt from such liability if it appeals to the Court
necessary to ea1'1'y into eilect the intention of the test:1t.or, and there is other snfiicient estate.

§ 1564. When an estate given by will has j
been sold for the payment of debts or expenses, all the i
devisees and legatees must contribute‘ according to
their respective interests to the devisee or legatee
whose devise or legacy has been taken therefor, and

§ 1565. If a decedent, at the time of his
death, was possessed of a contract for the purchase of

lands, his interest in such land and under such con- ‘

tracts may be sold on the application of his executor
or administrator, in the same manner as if he had died
seized of such land, and the same proceedings may be
had for that purpose as are prescribed in this Chapter
for the sale of lands of which he died seized, except
as hereinafter provided.

§ 1566. The sale must be made subject to
all payments that may thereafter become due on such
contracts, and if there are any such, the sale must not
be confirmed by the Probate Judge until the purchasers execute a bond to the executor or administrator, for the benefit and indemnity of himself and of
the persons entitled to the interest of the decedent in
the lands so contracted for, in double the whole amount
of payments thereafter to become due on such contract, With such sureties as the Probate Judge shall

approve.

§ 1567. The bond must be conditioned
that the purchaser will make all payments for such
land that become due after the date of the sale, and

will fully indemnify the executor or administrator and

the persons so entitled against all demands, costs,
charges, and expenses, by reason of any covenant or

agreement contained in such contract.

the executor or administrator must execute to the purchaser an assignment of the contract, which vests in
the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, all the right, title,
and interest of the estate, or of the persons entitled to
the interest of the decedent, in the lands sold at the
time of the sale, and the purchaser has the same rights
and remedies against the vendor of such land as the
decedent would have bad if he were living.

§ 1569. When any sale is made by an
executor or administrator, pursuant to the provisions
of this Chapter, of lands subject to any mortgage or
other lien, which is a valid claim against the estate of
the decedent, and has been presented and allowed,
the purchase money must be applied, after paying the
necessary expenses of the sale, first to the payment
and satisfaction of the mortgage or lien, and the
residue, if any, in due course of administration. The
application of the purchase money to the satisfaction
of the mortgage or lien must be made Without delay;
and the land is subject to such mortgage or lien until
the purchase money has been actually so applied. No
claim against any estate which has been presented
and allowed is affected by the Statute of Limitations,
pending the proceedings for the settlement of the
estate. The purchase money, or so much thereof as
may be sufficient to pay such mortgage or lien, with
interest, and any lawful costs and charges thereon, may
be paid into the Probate Court, to be received by the
Clerk thereof‘, whereupon the mortgage or lien upon
the land must cease, and the purchase money must be
paid over by the Clerk of the Court without delay, in
payment of the expenses of the sale, and in satisiaction

of the debt, to secure which the mortgage or other
lien was taken, and the surplus, if any, at once returned to the executor or administrator, unless for
good cause shown, after notice to the executor or
administrator, the Court otherwise directs.

Probate Court, of lands upon which there is a mortgage or lien, the holder thereof may become the purchaser, and his receipt for the amount due him from
the proceeds of the sale is a payment pro tanto. If

insumcient to defray the expenses and discharge his
mortgage or lien, he must pay to the Court or the Clerk
thereof an amount sufiicient to pay such expenses.

§ 1571. If there is any neglect or misconduct in the proceedings of the executor in relation to
any sale, by which any person interested in the estate
suffers damage, the party aggrieved may recover the
same in an action upon the bond of the executor or
administrator, or otherwise.

§ 1572. Any executor or administrator who
fraudulently sells any real estate of a decedent contrary to or otherwise than under the provisions of this Chapter, is liable in double the value of the land sold,
as liquidated damages, to be recovered in an action by
the person having an estate of inheritance therein. .

§ 1573. _N o action for the recovery of any
estate, sold by an executor or administrator under the
provisions of this Chapter, can be maintained by any
heir or other person claiming under the decedent,
unless it be commenced within three years next after
the sale. An action to set aside the sale may be instituted and maintained at any time within three years
from the discovery of the fraud, or other grounds upon
which the action is based.

§ 1574. The preceding section shall not
apply to minors or others under any legal disability,to
sue at the time when the right of action first accrues;
but all such persons may commence an action at any

time within three years after the removal of the disability.

§ 1575. When a sale has been made by an
executor or administrator, of any property of the estate,
real or personal, he must return to the Probate Court,
at its next term thereader, an account of sales, verified
by his athdavit. If he neglects to make such return,
he may be punished by attachment, or his letters may
be revoked, one day's notice having been first given
him to appear and show cause Why such attachment

should not issue, or such revocation should not be

directly or indirectly, purchase any property of the
estate he represents, nor must he be interested in any
sale.

§ 1581. The executor or administrator
must take into his possession all the estate of the
decedent, real and personal, and collect all debts due
to the decedent or to the estate. For the purpose of
bringing suits to quiet title, or for partition of such
estate, the possession of the executors or administrators
is the possession of the heirs or devisees; such possession by the heirs or devisees is subject, however, to
the possession of the executor or administrator, for the
purposes of administration, as provided in this Title.

§ 1582. Actions for the recovery of any
property, real or personal, or for the possession thereof,
and all actions founded upon contracts, may be maintained by and against executors and administrators, in

all cases in which the same might have been maintained by or against their respective testators or intestates.

§ 1583. Executors and administrators may
maintain actions against any person who has wasted,

lifetime.

§ 1584. Any person or his personal representatives may maintain an action against the executor
or administrator of any testator or intestate who in

the real estate of such person.

§ 1585. When a partnership exists between
the decedent, at the time of his death, and any other
person, the surviving partner has the right to continue
in possession of the partnership, and to settle its
business, but the interest of the decedent in the part»
nership must be included in the inventory, and be
appraised as other property. The surviving partner
must settle the affairs of the partnership without delay,
and account with the executor or administrator, and
pay over such balances as may from time to time be
payable to him, in iight of the decedent. Upon the
application of the executor or administrator, the Probate Judge may, whenever it appears necessary, order
the surviving partner to render an account, and in case
of ‘neglect or refusal may, after notice, compel it by
attachment; and the executor or administrator may
maintain against him any action which the decedent
could have maintained.

§ 1586. An administrator may, in his own

a name, for the use and benefit of all parties interested

in the estate, maintain actions on the bond of an
executor, or of any former administrator of the same
estate.

§ 1587. In actions by or against executols,
it is not necessary to join those as parties to whom
letters were issued, but who have not qualified.

§ 1588. Whenever a debtor of a decedent
is unable to pay all his debts, the executor or administrator, With the approbation of the Probate Court or
Judge, may compound with him, and give him a discharge upon receiving a fair and just dividend of his
effects. A compromise may also be authorized, when

it appears to be just, and for the best interest of the
estate.

§ 1589. When there is a deficiency of
assets in the hands of an executor or administrator,
and when the decedent, in his lifetime, has conveyed

any real estate, or any rights or interests therein, with
intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid any right,
debt, or duty of any person, or has so conveyed such
estate that by law the deeds or conveyances are void
as against creditors, the executor or administrator
must commence and prosecute to final judgment any
proper action for the recovery of the same; and may
recover for the beneiit of the creditor all such real
estate so fraudulently conveyed; and may also, for the
beneht of the creditors, sue and recover all goods,
chattels, rights, or credits which have been so conveyed by the decedent in his lifetime, Whatever may
have been the manner of such fraudulent conveyance.

§ 1590. No executor or administrator is‘

bound to sue for such estate as mentioned in the preceding section, for the benefit of the creditors, unless
on application of creditors, who must pay such part
of the costs and expenses of the suit, or give such
security to the executor or administrator therefor, as
the Probate Judge shall direct.

§ 1591. All real estate so recovered must
be sold for the payment of debts, in the same manner
as if the decedent had died seized thereof, upon
obtaining an order therefor from the Probate Court;
and the proceeds of all goods, chattels, rights, and
credits so recovered must be appropriated in payment
of the debts of the decedent, in the same manner

as other property in the hands of .the executor or
administrator.

§ 1597. When a person who is bound by
-contract in Writing to convey any real estate, dies before making the conveyance, and in all cases where
such decedent, if living, might be compelled to make
such conveyance, the Probate Court may make a decree
authorizing and directing his executor or administrator to convey such real estate to the person entitled

thereto.

§ 1598. On the presentation of a verified
petition by any person claiming to be entitled to such
conveyance from an executor or‘ administrator, setting
forth the facts upon which the claim is predicated, the
Probate Court must appoint a time and place for hearing the petition, at a regular term of the Court, and
must order notice thereof to be published at least four
successive weeks before such hearing, in such newspaper in this State as he may designate.

§ 1599. At the time and place appointed
for the hearing, or at such other time to which the
same may be postponed, upon satisfactory proof, by

affidavit or otherwise, of the,due publication of the
notice, the Court must proceed to a hearing, and all
persons interested in the estate may appear and contest
such petition, by filing their objections in writing, and
the Court may examine, on oath, the petitioner and all
who may be produced before him for that purpose.

§ 1600. If, after a full hearing upon the
petition and objections, ‘and examination of the facts
and circumstances of the claim, the Court is satisfied
that the petitioner is entitled to a conveyance of the
real estate described in the petition, a decree authorizing and directing the executor or administrator to
execute a conveyance thereof to the petitioner must

be made, entered on the minutes of the Court, and
recorded. .

§ 601. The executor or administrator must
execute the conveyance according to the directions of
the decree, a certified copy of which must be recorded
with the deed in the office of the Recorder of the
county where the lands lie, and is primary evidence of
the correctness of the proceedings, and of the authority

of the executor or administrator to make the conveyance.

§ 1602. If, upon hearing in the Probate
Court, as hereinbefore provided, the right of the petitioner to have a specific performance of the contract
is found to be ‘doubtful, the Court must dismiss the
petition Without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner, who may, at any time Within six months thereafter, proceed, in the District Court, to enforce a specific performance thereof.

§ 1603. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a decree of the Probate Court, as provided in
this Chapter, shall pass the title to the estate contracted

for as fully as if the contracting party himself was still
living and executed the conveyance.

§ 1604. A copy of the decree for a con’ veyance, made by the Probate Court, and duly certified and recorded in the oflice of the Recorder of the
county where the lands lie, gives the person entitled
to the conveyance a right to the possession of the lands
contracted for, and to hold the same according to the
terms of the intended conveyance, in like manner as
if they had been conveyed in pursuance of the decree.

§ 1605. The recording of any decree, as

provided in the preceding section, shall not prevent

the Court making the decree from enforcing the same
by other process. ‘

§ 1606. If the person entitled to the conveyance dies before the commencement of proceedings therefor under this Chapter, or before the completion of the conveyance, any person entitled to sueceed to his rights in the contract, or the executor or
administrator of such decedent may, for the benefit of
the person so entitled, commence such proceedings, or
prosecute any already commenced, and the conveyance
must be so made as to vest the estate in the persons

entitled to it,‘or in the executor or administrator, for
their benefit.

§ 1607. The decree provided for in this Chapter may direct the possession of the property
therein described to be surrendered to the person

entitled thereto, upon his producing the deed and a
certified copy of the decree, when, by the terms of
the contract, possession is to be surrendered.

§ 1612. No executor or administrator is
chargeable upon any specialipromise to answer damages or to pay the debts ‘of the testator or intestate
out of his own estate, unless the agreement for that
purpose, or some memorandum or note thereof‘, is in

or by some other person by him thereunto specially
authorized.

§ 1613. Every executor and administrator
is chargeable in his account with the whole of the
estate of the decedent which may come into his possession, at the value of the appraisement contained in
the inventory, except as provided in the following sections, and with all the interest, profit, and income of
the estate.

§ 1614. He shall not make proiit bythe
increase, nor suffer loss by the decrease, or destruction, without his fault, of any part of the estate. He

§ 1615. No executor or administrator is
accountable for any debts due to the decedent, if it

appears that they remain uncollected without his
fault.

§ 1616. He shall be allowed all necessary

_ expenses in the care, management, and settlement of

the estate, and for his services such fees as provided
in this Chapter; but when the decedent, by his will,

services, unless, by a written instrument, filed in the
Probate lourt, he renounces all claim for compensation provided by the will.

§ 1617. No administrator or executor shall
purchase any claim against the estate he represents;
and if he pays any claim for less than its nominal
value he is only entitled to charge in his account the

dollars, at the rate of five per cent; for all above that
sum, at the rate of four per cent; and the same commission must be allowed administrators. In all cases, .

Judge may deem just and reasonable, for any extraordinary service. The total amount of such allowance
must not exceed the amount of commissions allowed
by this section.

showing the amount of money received and expended
by him, the amount of all claims presented against
the estate and the names of the claimants, and all
other matters necessary to show the condition of its

§ 1623. If the executor or administrator
fails to render an exhibit at the third term of the Court,
the Judge of the Probate Court must cause a citation

should be made.

§ 1625. If the Judge is -satisfied, either
from the oath of the applicant or from any other testimony otfered, that the facts alleged are true, and considers the showing of the applicant sufficient, he must

named in the citation, which must be during a term of
the Court, and render an exhibit as prayed for.

§ 1626. When an exhibit is rendered by
an executor or administrator, any person interested
may appear and, by objections in Writing, contest any
account or statement therein contained. The Court
may examine the executor or administrator, and if he
has been guilty of neglect, or has wasted, embezzled,
or mismanaged the estate, his letters must be revoked.

§ 1627. If any executor or administrator
neglects or refuses to appear and render an exhibit,
after having been duly cited, an attachment may be

no attachment must issue unless a citation has been’

first issued, served, and returned, requiring the executor or administrator to appear and show cause why an
attachment should not issue. Every account rendered
must exhibit not only the debts which have been paid,
but also a statement of all debts which have been duly
presented and allowed during the period embraced in
the account.

§ 1629. When the authority of an executor or administrator ceases or is revoked for any reason,
he may be cited to account before the Probate Court
at the instance of the person succeeding to the administration of the same estate, in like manner as he might
have been cited by any person interested in the estate
during the time he Was executor or administrator.

§ 1630. If the executor or administrator
resides out of the county, or absconds, or conceals
himself, so that the citation cannot be personally

executor or administrator must produce and tile vouchers for all charges, debts, claims, and expenses which
he has paid, which must remain in the Court; and he
may be examined on oath touching such payments,
and also touching any property and effects of the dececcnt, and the disposition thereof. When any voucher
is required for other purposes, it may be withdrawn

on leaving a certified copy on file; if a voucher is lost,
or for other good reason cannot be produced on the
settlement, the payment may be proved by the oath

of any competent witness.

§ 1632. On the settlement of his account
he may be allowed any item of expenditure, not
exceeding twenty dollars, for which no voucher is produced, if such item be supported by his own uncontradicted oath positive to the fact of payment, specifying

allowances in the Whole must not exceed iive hundred
dollars against any one estate.

§ 1633. When any account is rendered for
settlement, the Court or Judge must appoint a day for
the settlement thereof; the Clerk must thereupon give
notice thereof, by causing notices to be posted in at
least three public places in the county, setting forth
the name of the estate, the executor or administrator,
and the day appointed for the settlement of the
account, which must be on some day of a term of the
Court. The Court or Probate Judge may order such
further notice to be given as may be proper.

§ 1634. If the account mentioned in the preceding

' section is for a iinal settlement, and the estate is ready
or for distribution and partition, the notice thereof

required to be published must state these facts; and,
on confirmation of the final account, distribution and
partition of the estate to all entitled thereto must be
immediately had, Without further notice or proceedings. If, from any cause, the hearing of the account

’ or the partition and distribution is postponed, the

order postponing the same to a day certain, is notice
to all persons interested therein.

§ 1635. On the day appointed, or any subsequent day to which the hearing may be postponed

l by the Court, any person interested in the estate may

appear and file his exceptions in writing to the account,
and contest the same.

claims not passed upon on the settlement of any former
account, or on rendering an exhibit, or on making a
decree of sale, may be co_ntested by the heirs, for cause
shown. The hearing and allegations of the respective
parties may be postponed from time to time, when necessary, and the Court may appoint one or more referees
to examine the accounts and make report thereon, subject to conhrmation; and may allow a reasonable compensation to the referees, to be paid out of the estate
of the decedent.

§ 1637. The settlement of the account,
and the allowance thereof by the Court, or upon
appeal, is conclusive against all persons in any way
interested in the estate, saving, however, to all persons laboring under any legal disability, their rights to
proceed against the executor or administrator, either
individually or upon his bond,_within two years after
their respective disabilities cease; and in any action
brought by any such person, the allowance and settlement of the account is primary evidence of its correctness.

§ 1638. The account must not be allowed
by the Court until it is first proved that notice has
been given as required by this Chapter, and the decree
must show that such proof was made to the satisfaction of the Court, and is conclusive evidence of the

fact.


§ 1643. The debts of the estate subject to
the provisions of Sec. 1205 must be paid in the following order:

1. Funeral expenses;

2. The expenses of the last sickness;

States;
4. Judgments rendered against the decedent in his

lifetime, and mortgages, in the order of their date;

5. All other demands against the estate.

§ 1644. The preference given in the preceding section to a mortgage only extends to the proceeds of the property mortgaged. If the proceeds of
such property is insuiiicient to pay the mortgage, the
part remaining unsatisiied must be classed with other
demands against the estate.

§ 1645. If the estate is insufiicient to pay

’ all the debts of any one class,.each creditor must be

paid a dividend in- proportion to his claim; and no
creditor of any one class shall receiveany payment
until all those of the preceding class are fully paid.

§ 1646. The executor or administrator, as
soon as he has sufficient funds in his hands, must pay
the funeral expenses and the expenses of the last sickness, and the allowance made to the family of the
decedent. He may retain in his hands the necessary
expenses of administration, but he is not obliged to
pay any other debt or any legacy until, as prescribed
in this Article, the payment has been ordered by the
Court.

§ 1647. Upon the settlement of the accounts of the executor or administrator, at the end of
the year, as required in this Chapter, the Court must
make an order for the payment of the debts, as the
circumstances of the estate require. If there is not
sufiicient funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, the Court must specify in the decree the sum
to be paid to each creditor. If the Whole property of
the estate be exhausted by such payment or distribution, such -account must be considered as a final account, and the executor or administrator is entitled to
his discharge, on producing and filing the necessary
vouchers and proofs showing that such payments have
been made, and that he has‘fully complied with the
decree of the Court.

§ 1648. If there is any claim not due, or
any contingent or disputed claim against the estate,
the amount thereof, or such part of the same as the
holder would be entitled to if the claim were due,
established, or absolute, must be paid into the Court,
and there remain, to be paid over to the party when
he becomes entitled thereto; or, if he fails to establish
his claim, to be paid over or distributed as the circumstances of the estate require. If any creditor Whose
claim has been allowed, but is not yet due, appears
and assents to a deduction therefrom of the legal interest for the time the claim has yet to run, he is entitled to be paid accordingly. The payments provided
for in this section are not to be made when the estate
is insolvent, unless a pro rata distribution is ordered.

§ 1649. When a ‘decree is made by the
Probate Court for the payment of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally liable to each creditor for his allowed claim, or the dividend thereon, and
execution may be issued on such decree, as upon a
judgment in the District Court, in favor of each creditor, and the same proceeding may be had under such
execution as if it had been issued from the District
Court. The executor or administrator is liable therefor, on his bond, to each creditor.

§ 1650. When the accounts of the administrator or executor have been settled, and an order
made for the payment of debts and distribution of
the estate, no creditor Whose claim was not included
in the order for payment has any right to call upon
the creditors who have been paid, or upon the heiis,
devisees, or legatees to contribute to the payment of
his claim; but if the executor or administrator has
failed to give the notice to the creditors, as prescribed

in Section 1491, such creditor may recover on the
bond of the executor or administrator the amount of

his claim, or such part thereof as he would have been
entitled to had it been allowed. This section shall
not apply to any creditor whose claim was not due
ten months before the day of settlement, or Whose
claim Was contingent and did not become absolute ten
months before such day.

§ 1651. If the Whole of the debts have
been paid by the first distribution, the Court must

direct the payment of legacies and the distribution of
the estate among the heirs, legatees, or other persons

entitled, as provided in the next Chapter; but if there
be debts remaining unpaid, or if, for other reasons, the
estate be not in a proper condition to be closed, the
Court must give such extension of time as may be
reasonable for a iinal settlement of the estate.

§ 1652. At the time designated in the _last section, or sooner, if Within that time all the property
of the estate has been sold, or there are sudicient
funds inihis hands for the payment of all the debts due
by the estate, and the estate be in a proper condition
to be closed, the executor or administrator must render a final account, and pray a settlement of his administration.

§ 653. If he neglects to render his account,
the same proceedings may be had as prescribed in this Chapter in regard to the first account to be rendered
by him; and all the provisions of this Chapter relative
to the last mentioned account, and the notice and settlement thereof, apply to his account presented for final
settlement.


§ 1658. At any time after the lapse of four
months from the issuing of letters testamentary or oft
administration, any heir, devisee, or legatee may pref

him upon his giving bonds, with security, for the payment of his proportion of the debts of the estate.

§ 1659. Notice of the application must be;
given to the executor or administrator, personally, and?
to all persons interested in the estate, in the same?
manner that notice is required to be given of the set;
tlement of the account of an executor or administnltor1660. The executor or administrator, or
any person interested in the estate, may appear at. the
time named and resist the application, or any other
heir, devisee, or legatee may make a similar applica
tion for himself.

§ 1661. If at the hearing,
it appears that the estate is but little indebted, and
that the share of the party applying may be allowed
to him without lossto the creditors of the estate, the
Court must make an order in conformity with the
prayer of the applicant, requiring:

1. Each heir, legatee, or devisee obtaining snchl
order, before receiving his share or any portion thereoii
to execute and deliver to the executor or administrator a bond, in such sum as shall be designated by the
Probate Judge, with sureties to be approved by thz
Judge, payable to the executor or administrator, and
conditioned for the payment, whenever required, of

his proportion of the debts due from the estate, not 5
exceeding the value or amount of the legacy or por- 3
tion of the estate to which he is entitled; ‘

2. The executor or administrator to deliver to the
heir, legatee, or devisee the whole portion of the
estate to which he may be entitled, or only a part
thereof, designating it.

must be made in the manner hereinafter prescribed.
The costs of these proceedings to be paid by the
applicant, or if there be more than one, to be apportioned equally amongst them.

§ 1662. When any bond has been executed and delivered, under the provisions of the preceding section, and it is necessary for the settlement
of the estate to require the payment of any part of
the money thereby secured, the executor or administrator must petition the Court for an order requiring
the payment, and have a citation issued and served on
the party bound, requiring him to appear and show
cause why the order should not be made. At the
hearing, the Court, if satisiied of the necessity of such
payment, must make an order accordingly, designating
the amount and giving a time within which it must be
paid. If the money is not paid within the time allowed,

an action may be maintained by the executor or
administrator on the bond.


§ 1665. Upon the final settlement of the
accounts of the executor or administrator, or at any
subsequent time, upon the application of the executor
or administrator, or of any heir, legatee, or devisee,
the Court must proceed to distribute the residue of

the estate in the hands of the executor or administrator, if any, among the persons who by law are entitled thereto ; and if the decedent has leR a surviving
child, and the issue of other children, and any of them,
before the close of administration, have died while
under age and not having been married, no administration on such deceased child’s estate is necessary,
but all the estate which such deceased child was entitled to by inheritance must, without administration, be
distributed to the other heirs at law. A statement of
any receipts and disbursements of the executor or administrator, since the rendition of his nnal accounts,
must be reported and filed at the time of making such
distribution, and a settlement thereof, together with
an estimate of the expenses of closing the estate, must
be made by the Court and included in the order or
decree; or the Court or Judge may order notice of
the settlement of such supplementary account, and
refer the same as in other cases of the settlement of

accounts.

§ 1666. In the order or decree, the Court
must name the persons and the proportions or parts to
which each shall be entitled, and such persons may
demand, sue for, and recover their respective shares
from the executor or administrator, or any person having the same in possession. Such order or decree is
conclusive as to the rights of heirs, legatees, or devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, or modified
on appeal.

\

§ 1667. Upon application for distribution,
after final settlement of the accounts of administration,
if the decedent was a non-resident of this State, leaving a will which has been duly proved or allowed in
the State of his residence, and an authenticated copy
thereof has been admitted to probate in this State,
and it is necessary, in order that the estate or any part
thereof may be distributed according to the Will, that
the estate in this State should be delivered to the
executor or administrator in the State or place of his
residence, the Court may order such delivery to be
made, and, if necessary, order a sale of the real estate,
and a like delivery of the proceeds. The delivery, in
accordance with the order of the Court, is a full discharge of the executor or administrator with the will
annexed, in this State, in relation to all property embraced in such order, which, unless reversed on appeal,
binds and concludes all parties in interest. Sales of
real estate ordered by virtue of this section must be
made in the same manner as other sales of real estate
of decedents by order of the Probate Court.

§ 1668. The order or decree may be made

on the petition of the executor or administrator, or of
any person interested in the estate, but notice must be
given, or waived, unless distribution is made, or the
time for making it is fixed by order of the Court at
the time of the settlement of the final account. All
proceedings not so Waived or dispensed with, must be
had in the manner provided in Article IV, Chapter
VII, of this Title, for sale of real estate by an executor or' administrator. The Court may order such
further notice to be given as it may deem proper. If
partition is applied for, as provided in this Chapter,
such decree shall not divest the Court of jurisdiction
for the purposes of partition, unless the estate is finally
closed.

§ 1669. Before any decree of distribution
of an estate is made, the Probate Court must be satisfied, by the oath of the executor or administrator, or
otherwise, that all State, county, and municipal taxes,

legally levied upon personal property of the estate,
have been fully paid.

§ 1675. When the estate, real or personal,
assigned by the decree of distribution to two or more
heirs, devisees, or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respective shares are not separated and
distinguished, partition, or distribution, may be made
by three disinterested persons, to be appointed Commissioners for that purpose by the Probate Court or
Judge, Who must be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of their duties. A certified copy of the order
of their appointment, and of the order or decree
assigning and distributing the estate, must be issued
to them as their warrant, and their oath must _be
indorsed thereon. Upon consent of the parties, or
when the Court deems it proper and just, it is suflicient to appoint one Commissioner only, who has the
same authority and is governed by the same ‘rules as
if three were appointed.

§ 1676. Such partition may be ordered and
had in the Probate Court, on the petition of any person interested. But before Commissioners are appointed, or partition ordered by the Probate Court as
directed in this Chapter, notice thereof must be given
to all persons interested, who reside in this State, or
to their guardians, and to the agents, attorneys, or
guardians, if any in this State, of such as reside out of
the State, either personally or by public notice, as the
Probate Court may direct. The petition may be hled,
attorneys, guardians, and agents appointed, and notice
given, at any time before the order or decree of distribution, but the Commissioners must not be appointed
until the order or decree is made distributing the
estate.

§ 1677. If the real estate is in different
counties, the Probate Court may, if deemed proper,
appoint a Commissioner for all, or different Commissioners for each county. The estate in each county
must be divided separately among the heirs, devisees,
or legatees, as if there was no other estate to be
divided, but the Commissioner first appointed must,
unless otherwise directed by the Probate Court, make division of such real estate, wherever situated within

this State.

§ 1678. Partition or distribution of the
real estate may be made as provided in this Chapter,
although some of the original heirs, legatees, or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons,
and such shares must be assigned to the person holding
the same, in. the same manner as they otherwise would

have been to such heirs, legatees, or devisees.

§ 1679. When both distribution and partition are made, the several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out to each, individual in
proportion to his right, by metes and bounds, or
description, so that the same can be easily distinguished, unless two or more of the parties interested
consent to have their shares setiout so as to be held by
them in common and undivided.

§ 1680. When the real estate cannot be

- divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the

owners, the Probate‘ Court may assign the whole to
one or more of the parties entitled to share therein
who will accept it, always preferring the males to the
females, and among children preferring the elder to the
younger. The parties accepting the whole must pay
to the other parties interested their just proportion of
the true value thereof, or secure the same to their
satisfaction, or, in case of the minority of such party,
then to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true
value of the estate must be ascertained and reported
by the Commissioners. When the Commissioners
appointed to make partition are of the opinion that
the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or
inconvenience to the owners, they must so report to the
Court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as
herein provided, and must find and report the true
value of such real estate. On filing the report of the
Commissioners, and on making or securing the payment as before provided, the Court, if it appears just
and proper, must confirm the report, and thereupon
the assignment is complete, and the title to the whole
of such real estate vests in the person to whom the
same is so assigned. '

§ 1681. When any tract of land or tenement is of greater value than any one’s share in the
estate to be divided, and cannot be divided Without

injury to the same, it may be set off by the Commissioners appointed to make partition to any of the parties who will accept it, giving preference as prescribed
in the preceding section. The party accepting must
pay or secure to the others such sums as the Commissioners shall award to make the partition equal, and
the Commissioners must make their award accordingly; but such partition must not be established by
the Court until the sums awarded are paid to the parties entitled to the same, or secured to their satisfaction.

§ 1682. When it appears to the Court,
from the Commissioners’ report, that it cannot otherwise be fairly divided, and should be sold, the Court
may order the sale of the whole or any part of the
estate, real or personal, by the executor or administrator, or by a Commissioner appointed for that purpose,
and the proceeds distributed. The sale must be conducted, reported, and confirmed in the same manner

and under the same requirements provided in Article
IV, Chapter VII of this Title.

§ 1683. Before any partition is made or
any estate divided, as provided in this Chapter, notice
must be given to all persons interested in the partition, their guardians, agents, or attorneys, by the Commissioners, of the time and place when and where
they shall proceed to make partition. The Commissioners may take testimony, order surveys, and take
such other steps as may be necessary to enable them
to form a judgment upon the matters before them.

§ 1684. The Commissioners must report
their proceedings, and the partition agreed upon by
them, to the Probate Court, in writing, and the Court
may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the report and
commit the same to the same Commissioners, or

appoint others; and When such report is finally coniirmed, a certified copy of the judgment or decree of
partition made thereon, attested by the Clerk, under
the seal of the Court, must be recorded in the office
of the Recorder of the county where the lands lie.

§ 1685. When the Probate Court makes a
judgment or decree assigning the residue of any estate
to one or more persons entitled to the same, it is not
necessary to appoint Commissioners to make partition
or distribution thereof, unless the parties to whom the

assignment is decreed, or some of them, request that
such partition be made.

§ 1686. All questions as to advancements
made, or alleged to have been made, by the decedent
to his heirs, may be heard and determined by the
Probate Court, and must be specified in the decree
assigning and distributing the estate; and the final
judgment or decree of the Probate Court, or, in case
of appeal, of the Supreme Court, is binding on all
parties interested in the estate.

§ 1691. When any estate is assigned or
distributed by a judgment or decree of the Court, as
provided in this Chapter, to any person residing out

of and having no agent in this State, and it is necessary that some person should be authorized to take
possession and charge of the same for the benefit of
such absent person, the Court may appoint an agent
for that purpose, and authorize him to take charge of
such estate as well as to act for such absent person in
the distribution. 2

§ 1692. The agent must first give a bond
to the Probate Judge, to be approved by him, conditioned that he shall faithfully manage and account for
the estate. The Court appointing such agent may
allow a reasonable sum out of the profits of the estate
for his services and expenses.

§ 1693. When personal property remains
in the hands of the agent unclaimed for a year, and it
appears to the Court that it is for the benefit of those
interested, it shall be sold under the order of the Court,
and the proceeds, after deducting the expenses of the

‘sale allowed by the Court, must be paid into the State

Treasury. ‘ When the payment is made, the agent
must take from the Treasury duplicate receipts, one
of which he must file in the office of the Controller,
and the other in the Probate Court.

§ 694. The agent must render to the Probate Court
appointing him, annually, an account, showing:

1. The value and character of the property received «
by him, what portion thereof is still on hand, What
sold, and for what;

2. The income derived therefrom;

3. The taxes and assessments imposed thereon, for
what, and whether paid or unpaid;

4. Expenses incurred in the care, protection, and
management thereof, and whether paid or unpaid.

W’hen filed, the Probate Court may examine witnesses and take proofs in regard to the account; and if
satisfied from such accounts and proofs that it will be

for the beneiit and advantage of the persons interested
therein, the Court may, by order, direct a sale to be
made of the Whole or such parts of the real or personal property as shall appear to be proper, and the
purchase money to be deposited in the State Treasury.

§ 1695. The agent is liable on his bond
for the care and preservation of the estate While in his
hands, and for the payment of the proceeds of the
sale as required in the preceding sections, and may be
sued thereon by any person interested.

§ 1696. When any person appears and
claims the money paid into the Treasury, the Probate
Court making the distribution must inquire into such
claim, and being first satisfied of his right thereto,
must grant him a certificate to that effect, under its
seal; and upon the presentation of the certificate to
him, the Controller must draw his Warrant on the
Treasurer for the amount.

§ 1697. “Then the estate has been fully
administered, and it is shown by the executor or administrator, by the production of satisfactory vouchers,
that he has paid all sums of money due from him, and
delivered up, under the order of the Court, all the
property of the estate to the parties entitled, and performed all the acts lawfully required of him, the Court
must make a judgment or decree discharging him
from all liability to be incurred thereafter.

§ 1698. The final settlement of an estate
does not prevent the subsequent issuance of letters
testamentary, or of administration with the Will annexed, whenever other property of the estate is discovered, or whenever it becomes necessary or proper,
from any cause, that letters should be again issued.

§ 1704. All orders and decrees made by

and published in a newspaper, as required in the order
to show cause Why the sale should not be made, such

costs, may be entered and enforced by execution or
otherwise, by the Probate Court, as in civil actions.

§ 1717. If no jury is demanded, the Court
must try the issues joined. If, on written demand, a
jury is called by either party, and the issues are not
sufiiciently made up by the written pleadings on file,
the Court, on due notice to the opposite party, must

. settle and frame the issues to be tried, and submit the

same, together with the evidence of each party, to the

such minors or non-residents, are unrepresented. The
order must specify the names of the parties for whom
the attorney is appointed, who is thereby authorized
to represent such parties in all such proceedings had
subsequent to his appointment. The appearance of
the attorney is sufficient proof of the service of the
notice on the parties he is appointed to represent.
The attorney may receive from the distributive shares
of the estate set apart for the parties Whom he represents, a fee not exceeding fifty dollars for his entire
services; if there is no distribution of the estate, this

cause, it becomes necessary, the Probate Court may
substitute another attorney for the one first appointed,
in vvhich case the fee must be proportionately divided.

are both non-residents, and the Ward is entitled to
property in this State which may be removed to
another State or foreign country without coniiict with
any restriction or limitation thereupon, or impairing
the right of the Ward thereto, such property may be

2. That he has entered upon the discharge of his
duties;
3. That he is entitled, by the laws of the State, to

his appointment to the possession of the estate of the
Ward.

Upon such application, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, the Probate Judge must make an order
granting to such guardian leave to take and remove
the property of his ward to the State or place of his
residence, which is authority to him to sue for and

receive the same in his own name, for the use and benefit of his ward.

§ 1799. Such order is a discharge of
the executor, administrator, local guardian, or other
person in whose possession the property may be at the

Court the receipt therefor of the foreign guardian of
such absent Ward. '


§ 1800. Upon complaint made to him

provisions of this Code.

§ 1823. Judicial evidence is the means, sanctioned
by law, of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the
truth respecting a question of fact.

§ 1824. Proof is the effect of evidence, the establishment of a fact by evidence.

§ 1825. The law of evidence, which is the subject
of this part of the Code, is a collection of general rules
established by law:

1. For declaring what is to be taken as true without
proof;

2. For declaring the presumptions of law, both those
which are disputable and those which are conclusive;
and,

3. _For the production of legal evidence;

4. For the exclusion of whatever is not legal;

5. For determining, in certain cases, the value and
effect of evidence.

§ 1826. The law does not require demonstration;
that is, such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility
of error, produces absolute certainty; because such
proof is rarely possible. Moral certainty only is
required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.

§ 1827. There are four kinds of evidence:

1. The knowledge of the Court;
2. The testimony of witnesses;

3. Writings; '
4. Other material objects presented to the senses.

§ 1828. There are several degrees of evidence:

1. Original and secondary;

2. Direct and indirect;

3. Primary, partial, satisfactory, indispensable, and
conclusive.

§ 1829. Original evidence is an original writing or
material object introduced in evidence.

§ 1830. Secondary evidence is a copy of such original Writing or object, or oral evidence thereof.

§ 1831. Direct evidence is that which proves the
fact in dispute, directly, without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if true, conclusively
establishes that fact. For example: if the fact in dispute be an agreement, the evidence of a Witness who
was present and witnessed the making of it, is direct.

§ 1832. Indirect evidence is that which tends to
establish the fact in dispute by proving another, and
which, though true, does not of itself conclusively
establish that fact, but which affords an inference or
presumption of its existence. For example: a witness
proves an admission of the party to the fact in dispute.
This proves a fact, from which the fact in dispute is

inferred. 0

§ 1833. Primary evidence is that which suffices for
the proof of a particular fact, until contradicted and
overcome by other evidence. For example: the certilicate of a recording ofiicer is primary evidence of a
record, but it may afterwards be rejected upon proof
that there is no such record.

§ 1834. Partial evidence is that which goes to establish a detached fact, in a series tending to the fact in
dispute. It may be received, subject to be rejected
as incompetent, unless connected with the fact in dispute by proof of other facts. For example: on an
issue of title to real property, evidence of the continued possession of a remote occupant is partial, for it is
of a detached fact, which may or may not be aRerWards connected with the fact in dispute.

§ 1835. That evidence is deemed satisfactory which
ordinarily produces moral certainty or conviction in an
unprejudiced mind. Such evidence alone will justify
a verdict. Evidence less than this is denominated

slight evidence.

§ 1836. Indispensable evidence is that without
which a particular fact cannot be proved.

§ 1837. Conclusive or unanswerable evidence is that
which the law does not permit to be contradicted.

For example, the record of a Court of competent jurisdiction cannot be contradicted by the parties to it.

§ 1838. Cumulative evidence is additional evidence
of the same character, to the same point.

§ 1839. Corroborative evidence is additional evidence of a diiferent character, to the same point.

§ 1844. The direct evidence of one Witness who is 4
entitled to full credit is sufficient for proof of any fact, '1
except perjury and treason. i

§ 1845. A witness can testify of those facts only
which he knows of his own knowledge; that is, which
are derived from his own perceptions, except in those
few express cases in which his opinions or inferences,
or the declarations of others, are admissible.

§ 1846. A witness can be heard only upon oath or
afiirmation, and upon a trial he can be heard only in
the presence and subject to the examination of all
the parties, if they choose to attend and examine.

§ 1847. A witness is presumed to speak the truth.
This presumption, however, may be repelled by the
manner in which he testifies, by the character of his
testimony, or by evidence affecting his character for
truth, honesty, or integrity, or his motives, or by contradictory evidence; and the jury are the exclusive
judges of his credibility.

§ 1848. The rights of the party cannot be prejudiced by the declaration, act, or omission of another,
except by virtue of a particular relation between
them; therefore, proceedings against one cannot affect

another.

§ 1849. Where, however, one derives title to real
property from another, the declaration, act, or omission
of the latter, while holding the title, in relation to
the property, is evidence against the former.

§ 1850. Where, also, the declaration, act, or omission
forms part of a transaction, which is itself the fact in
dispute, or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act,
or omission is evidence, as part of the transaction.

§ 1851. And where the question in dispute between
the parties is the obligation or duty of a third person,
whatever would be evidence for or against such person
is primary evidence between the parties.

§ 1852. The declaration, act, or omission of a mem, ber of a family who is a decedent, or out of the jurisdiction, is also admissible as evidence of common reputation, in cases where, on qu8stions of pedigree, such
reputation is admissible.

§ 1853. The declaration, act, or omission of a decedent, having suiiicient knowledge of the subject, against
his pecuniary interest, is also admissible as evidence to
that extent against his successor in interest.

§ 1854. When part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence by one party, the
whole on the same subject may be inquired into by the
other; when a letter is read, the answer may be given;
and when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or
writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation, or writing, which is necessary to
make it understood, may also be given in evidence.

§ 1855. There can be no evidence of the
contents of a writing, other than the writing itself,

except in the following cases:
1. When the original has been lost or destroyed; in
which case proof of the loss or destruction must first

be made;
2. When the original is in the possession of the

party against whom the evidence is offered, and he

fails to produce it after reasonable notice;
3. When the original is a record or other document

in the custody of a public oliicer;
4. When the.original has been recorded, and a certified copy of the record is made evidence by this
Code or by statute;

5. When the original consists of numerous accounts I
or other documents, which cannot be examined in
Court without great loss of time, and the evidence
sought from them is only the general result of the
whole.

In the cases mentioned in Subdivisions 3 and 4, a
copy of the original must be produced; in those mentioned in Subdivisions 1 and 2, either a copy or oral
evidence of the contents.

§ 1856. VVhen the terms of an agreement have been
reduced to Writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms, and therefore there
can be between the parties and their representatives,
or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of
the agreement other than the contents of the writing,
except in the following cases:

1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing
is put in issue by the pleadings;

2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact
in dispute. /

But this section does not exclude other evidence
of the circumstances under 'which the agreement
was made or to which it relates, as defined in Section 1860, or to explain an extrinsic ambiguity, or
to establish illegality or fraud. The ‘term agreement
includes deeds and wills, as well as contracts between
parties.

§ 1857. The language of a writing is to be interpreted according to the meaning it bears in the place
of its execution, unless the parties have reference to a
different place.

§ 1858. In the construction of a statute or instrument, the oflice of the Judge is simply to ascertain
and declare what is in terms or in substance contained
therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit

what has been inserted; and where there are several
provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.

§ 1859. In the construction of a statute the intention of the Legislature, and in the construction of the
instrument the intention of the parties, is to be pursued, if possible; and when a general and particular
provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to
the former. So a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.

§ 1860. For the proper construction of an instrument, the circumstances under which it was made,
including the situation of the subject of the instrument, and of the parties to it, may also be shown, so
that the Judge be placed in the position of those
Whose language he is to interpret. 1861. The terms of a Writing, are presumed to
have been used in their primary and general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible that they
have a local, technical,,or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used and understood in the particular instance, in which case the agreement must be construed accordingly.

§ 1862. When an instrument consists partly of written Words and partly of a printed form, and the two
are inconsistent, the former controls the latter.

§ 1863. When the characters in which an instrument is Written are difiicult to be deciphered, or the
language of the instrument is not understood by the
Court, the evidence of persons skilled in deciphering
the characters, or who understand the language, is
admissible to declare the characters or the meaning of

the language.

§ 1864. When the terms of an agreement have been
intended in a different sense by the different parties to
it, that sense is to prevail against either party in which
be supposed the other understood it, and when different constructions of a provision are otherwise equally
proper, that is to be taken which is most favorable to
the party in whose favor the provision was made.

§ 1865. A written notice, as Well as every other
writing, is to be construed according to the ordinary
acceptation of its terms. Thus a notice to the drawers
or indorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note,
that it has been protested for Want of acceptance or
payment, must be held to import that the same has
been duly presented for acceptance or payment and
the same refused, and that the holder looks for payment to the person to Whom the notice is given.

§ 1866. When a statute or instrument is equally
susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of
natural right, and the other against it, the former is
to be adopted.

§ 1867. None but a material allegation need be
proved.

§ 1868. Evidence must correspond with the substance of the material allegations, and be relevant to
the question in dispute. Collateral questions must
therefore be avoided. It is, hovvever, Within the discretion of the Court to permit inquiry into a collateral
fact, when such fact is directly connected with the
question in dispute, and is essential to its proper
determination, or when it aifects the credibility of a
witness.

§ 1869. Each party must prove his own afiirmative
allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of

a negative allegation, except when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of the
right or title on which the cause of action or defense
is founded, nor even in such case when the allegation
is a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party.

§ 1870. In conformity with the preceding provisions,
evidence may be given upon a trial of the following
facts:

1. The precise fact in dispute;

2._The act, declaration, or omission of a party, as
evidence against such party;

3. An act or declaration of another, in the presence

a person, the reason for the opinion being given;

11. Common reputation existing previous to the controversy, respecting facts of a public or general interest
more than thirty years old, and in cases of pedigree
and boundary;

12. Usage, to explain the true character of an act,
contract, or instrument, where such true character is
not otherwise plain; but usage is never admissible,
except as an instrument of interpretation;

13. Monuments and inscriptions in public places, as
evidence of common reputation; and entries in family
bibles, or other family books or charts; engravings on
rings, family portraits, and the like, as evidence of
pedigree;

14. The contents of a writing, when oral evidence
thereof is admissible;

15. Any other facts from which the facts in issue
are presumed or are logically inferable;

16. Such facts as serve to show the credibility of a
witness, as explained in Section 1847.

facts: . ‘

1. The true signification of all English Words and
phrases, and of all legal expressions;

§ 1879. All persons, without exception,
otherwise than is speciiied in the next two sections,

other persons who have an interest in the event of an

Courts, and the treatises of learned men.

and purporting to contain the statutes, code, or other
written law of such State or country, or proved to be
commonly admitted in the tribunals of such State or
country as evidence of the written law thereof, are
admissible in this State as evidence of such law.

Writing.

§ 1902. The oral testimony of witnesses skilled

and published books of reports of decisions of the
Courts of such State or country, or proved to be commonly admitted in such Courts.

thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the
administration of the estate of a decedent, or in repect to the personal, political, or legal condition or
relation of a particular person, the judgment or order
is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will, or
administration, or the condition or relation of the person;

2. In other cases, the judgment or order is, in respect
to the matter directly adjudged, conclusive between
the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special
proceeding, litigating for the same thing under the
same title and in the same capacity.

§ 1909. Other judicial orders of a Court or Judge
of this State, or of the United States, create a disputable presumption, according to the matter directly
determined, between the same parties and their representatives and successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special

proceeding, litigating for the-same thing under the
same title and in the same capacity.

§ 1910. The parties are deemed to be the same
when those between whom the evidence is offered
were on opposite sides in the former case, and a judgment or other determination could in that case have
been made between them alone, though other parties
were joined with bothior either.

§ 1911. That only is deemed to have been adjudged
in a former judgment which appears upon its face to
have been so adjudged, or which was actually and
necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.

§ 912. Whexiever, pursuant to the last four sections,
a party is bound by a record, and such party stands in

or proceeding, and an opportunity at the surety’s request to join in the defense.

§ 1913. The effect of a judicial record of a sister
State is the same in this State as in the State where it
was made, except that it can only be enforced here by

States.

§ 1915. The effect of the judgment of any other

tribunal of a foreign country having jurisdiction to .

pronounce the judgment, is as follows:

\

1. In case of a judgment against a specific thing,
the judgment is conclusive upon the title to the thing;
2. In case of a judgment against a person, the judgment is presumptive evidence of a right as between

the parties and their successors in interest by a sub-sequent title, and can only be repelled by evidence of
a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party,
collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.

§ 1916. Any judicial record may be impeached by
evidence of a want of jurisdiction in the Court or
judicial oflicer, of collusion between the parties, or of
fraud in the party offering the record, in respect to the

is jurisdiction over the cause, over the parties, and

the judgment.

follows:

1. Acts of the Executive of this State, by the records

Court of Common Pleas or County Court thereof, certifying that the person subscribing the transcript was,
at the date of the judgment, a Justice of the Peace
in the county, and that the signature is genuine. Such

of any law of the United States, or of this State, is

the time of the location, or time of filing a preéniption
claim on which the certiiicate may have been issued,
the land was in the adverse possession of the adverse
party, or those under whom he claims, or that the
adverse party is holding the land for mining purposes.

§ 1926. An entry made by an officer, or Board of

§ 1929. Private writings are either:
1. Sealed; or,
2. Unsealed.

§ 1930. A seal is a particular sign, made to attest,
in the most formal manner, the execution of an instrument.

§ 1931. A public seal in this State is a stamp or
impression made upon wax, wafer, paper, or any other
substance upon which a visible and permanent impression can be made. A private seal may be in the same
manner, or it may be made without an impression,
by a wafer or wax attached to the instrument, or by
a paper attached to it by an adhesive substance. A
scroll or other sign, made in a sister State or foreign
country, and there recognized as a seal, must be so
regarded in this State.

§ 1932. The seal aflixed to a writing is presumptive
evidence of a consideration. In other respects there
is no difference between sealed and unsealed writings.
A writing under seal may therefore be changed or
altogether discharged by a Writing not under seal, or
by an oral agreement otherwise valid.

§ 1933. The execution of an instrument is the subscribing and delivering it, with or without affixing a
seal.

indifferent between the parties, are primary evidence
of facts of general notoriety and interest. 1

§ 1937. The original writing must be produced and
proved, except as provided in Sections 1855 and 1919.
If it has been lost,‘ proof of the loss must first be made
before evidence can be given of its contents. Upon
such proof being made, together with proof of the due
execution of the writing, its contents may be proved
by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some
authentic document, or by the recollection of a witness, as provided in Section 1855.

§ 1938. If the writing be in the custody of the
adverse party, he must first have reasonable notice to
produce it. If he then fail to do so, the contents of
the writing may be proved as in case of its loss. But
the notice to produce it is not necessary where the
writing is itself a notice, or where it has been wrongfully obtained or withheld by the adverse party.

§ 1939. Though awriting called for by one party is
produced by the other, and is thereupon inspected by
the party calling for it, he is not obliged to produce it
as evidence in the case.

§ 1940. If there be a subscribing witness to a writing produced in evidence its execution must be proved
by him, if he is within reach of a subpoena, and can
be produced and can testify. If there be more than
one subscribing witness the evidence of one is suiiicient. If the subscribing witnesses cannot be produced, the execution may be proved by the party who
executed it, or by proof of his handwriting.

§ 1941. If the subscribing witness denies or does
not recollect the execution of the writing, its execution may still be proved by other evidence.

§ 1942. “There, however, evidence is given that
the party against whom the writing is offered has at
any time admitted its execution no other evidence of
the execution need be given, when the instrument is
one mentioned in Section 1945, or one produced from
the custody of the adverse party, and has been acted
upon by him as genuine. .

§ 1943. The handwriting of a person may be proved
by any one who believes it to be his, and who has seen
him write, or has seen writings purporting to be his,
upon which he has acted or been charged, and who
has thus acquired a knowledge of his handwriting.

§ 1944. Evidence respecting the handwriting may
also be given by a comparison, made by the witness
or the jury, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered.

§ 1945. Where a writing is more than thirty years
old, the comparisons may be made with writings purporting to be genuine, and generally respected and
acted upon as such, by persons having an interest in
knowing the fact.

§ 1946. The entries and other writings of a decedent, made at or near the time of the transaction, and
in a position to know the facts stated therein, may be
read as primary evidence of the facts stated therein,
in the following cases:

of the person making it;

2. VVhen it was made in a professional capacity
and in the ordinary course of professional conduct;

3. VVhen it was made in the performance of a duty

testaments, may be acknowledged or proved and certified in the manner provided for the acknowledgment
or proof of conveyances of real property, and the certificate of such acknowledgment or proof is primary
evidence of the execution of the writing, in the same
manner as if it were a conveyance of real property.

§ 1949. Every County Recorder must receive and
file in his oflice any private writing delivered to him
for that purpose, and give a written receipt therefor.
Such writing must be properly indorsed so as to indicate its general nature, the names of the parties thereto,
and the time of filing, and must be deposited and kept
in such oflice separate from other papers. It is then
subject to the examination of any person, but cannot
be withdrawn, except temporarily, upon the written
order of the depositor or his legal representatives, or
on the order of a Court of record, for the purpose of
being read in evidence therein.

§ 950. The record of a conveyance of real property,
or other record, a transcript of which is admissible in

§ 1954. Whenever an object, cognizable by’ the
senses, has such a relation to the fact in dispute as
to afford reasonable grounds of belief respecting it,
or to make an item in the sum of the evidence, such
object may be exhibited to the jury, or its existence,
situation, and character may be proved by witnesses.
The admission of such evidence must be regulated by
the sound discretion of the Court.

7. Any other presumption which, by statute, is
expressly made conclusive.

the judgment, that he had been convicted of a felony.

proper occasions:

1. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal
discretion, and in subordination to the rules of evidence;

2. That they are not bound to decide in conformity
with the declarations of any number of witnesses,
which do not produce conviction in their minds, against
a less number or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying their minds; 3. That a witness false in one part of his testimony
is to be distrusted in others;

4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be
viewed with distrust, and the evidence of the oral
admissions of a party with caution;

must be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory the decision must be made according to the preponderance of evidence; that in criminal cases guilt

own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence whichvit is in the power of one side to produce

to degrade his character, unless it be to the very fact
in issue, or to a fact from which the fact in issue would
be presumed. But a witness must answer as to the
fact of his previous conviction for felony.
