ing are known to any person other than the party, such person may make

veriﬁed, and the answer contains a counter-claim, the same may be veriﬁed
apart from the defense part of the answer, and the foregoing provisions are

one grounded on an injury to the person or the character.

action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has

ment; if the court is thus satisﬁed, a continuance may be granted to some
day in the same or the next term of said court. 

SEC. 3603. All matters of supplement or
amendment, whether of addition or subtraction, shall not be made by
erasure or interlineation of the original, or by addition thereto, but upon a

answer shall be made.

action by ordinary proceedings shall not be postponed on account of the
failure to answer interrogatories, if the party interrogated is present in
court at the trial, so that he may be orally examined; nor in case of absence,
unless an affidavit is ﬁled showing the facts the party believes will be proved
by the answers thereto, and that the party has not ﬁled the interrogatories

stated in the aﬂidavit shall be considered as admitted by those inter
rogated, the trial shall not be postponed for that cause. 

SEC. 3608. Particularity required. The party, in answering such

pleading not controverted by a subsequent pleading shall, for the purposes

whole be a part of the record. Such reporter shall be governed by teh law relating to official shorthand reporters.

SEC. 3743. Selection of referees. In all cases of reference, the par
ties, except when a minor is a party, may agree upon a suitable person or
persons, not exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered accord
ingly; and if the parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or more
referees, not exceeding three, who shall be persons free from objection, or
the court may allow each party to select one and itself select a third. 
SEC. 3744. Appointed in vacation. A judge of the court, when a
cause is pending, may, in vacation, upon the written consent of the parties,
make an order of reference, which shall be written on the agreement to refer,
and ﬁled with the clerk with the other papers in the case, and become part
of the record. 
SEC. 3746. Sworn. The referee must make affidavit well and faithfully
to hear and examine the case, and make a just and true report therein, accord
ing to the best of his understanding. The aﬂidavit shall be returned with
the report, ﬁled by the clerk, and be a part of the record. 

SEC. 3746. The order shall not be made until the case is
at issue as to the parties whose rights are to be examined on the reference.
The order may direct when the referee shall proceed to a hearing and
when he shall make his report, but, in the absence of such direction, he
shall do so on the morning of the tenth day after the day on which the
order of reference was made, and shall ﬁle his report as soon as done. The
parties shall take notice of the time thus ﬁxed or determined and non
attendance of either party within an hour thereof shall be attended with
like consequences as if the case were in court, which consequences shall be
reported as any other fact or ﬁnding of the referee.

SEC. 3747. Acceptance by referee. The referee must be called on by

within three days. It may be embodied in a. bill of exceptions to be ﬁled
within thirty days after the ﬁnal determination of the case, or within a rea
sonable time thereafter, to be ﬁxed by the court, not to exceed ninety days
therefrom. In equitable actions, triable de nova on appeal, no bill of excep
tions shall be necessary, nor in other actions in which all the proceedings
are, under the direction of the court, taken in writing or shorthand by the
regular court reporter, or another appointed by the court or judge for the
purpose, and embodied in a report by such reporter, certiﬁed by him and
the court or judge, in the manner provided in this chapter for making and
certifying such report. This section shall not be so construed as to prevent
any party embodying in a. bill of exceptions all or any part of the proceed
ings in any action in which he may elect to preserve his exceptions in that
form. And whenever the judge or referee trying a cause is unable by rea
son of death, removal, resignation or any cause to sign a bill of exceptions,
or certify the shorthand reporter’s record, the same shall be done by his
successor, and the time for such signing or certiﬁcation shall be extended
thirty days after the appointment, or election andqualiﬁcation of such suc

regarded.

on the record, and the grounds of the exception appear in the entry,
or when any error appears of record, the exception may be taken by the
party causing to be noted at the end of the decision, or in connection there
with, that he excepts.
SEC. 3752. A bill of exceptions,
when presented for signature, need not include therein, spread out at
length, any writing ﬁled in court, but may incorporate the same by any
unmistakable reference thereto; and the clerk, in making a transcript of
the bill of exceptions shall write therein at length all of such writing included therein by reference.

SEC. 3753. When the decision is not entered on the record,
or the grounds of objection do not suﬂiciently appear therein, the party
excepting must reduce his exception to writing and present it to the judge
for his signature, which, if it fairly presents the facts, he shall sign; if he
refuses, the party may procure the signature of two bystanders attesting
that the exception is correctly stated, and that the judge has refused to
sign the same, which bill of exceptions shall then be ﬁled with the clerk
and become a. part of the record. The truth of such exceptions may be
controverted and maintained by aﬂidavits, not exceeding ﬁve on each side,
which shall become a p
art of the record. All afﬁdavits impugning the
exception must be ﬁled within three days from the time of ﬁling the bill,
and all aﬂidavits sustaining the same within two days thereafter.

SEC. 3754. Must be on material point. No exception shall be regarded in the supreme court unless the ruling has been on a material
point, and the effect thereof prejudicial to the rights of the party excepting.

vacated and a new trial granted, on the application of the party aggrieved,
for the following causes aifecting materially the substantial rights of such
party :
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, referee or prevail
ing party; or any order of the court or referee, or abuse of discretion, by
which the party was prevented from having a fair trial;
2. Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party;
3. Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded

4. Excessive damages appearing to have been given under the inﬂuence
of passion or prejudice;

or too small, where the action is upon a contract or for the injury or deten
tion of property;
6. That the verdict, report or decision is not sustained by sufficient evi
dence, or is contrary to law:
7. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party applying, which
he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced atthe
trial ;
8. Error of law occurring at the trial, excepted to by the party making

within three days after the verdict, report or decision is rendered, unless
for good cause the court extends the time, except for the cause of newly

causes enumerated in subdivisions two, three and seven of the preceding section, may be sustained and controverted by aiﬁdavits.

SEC. 3767. Judgment notwithstanding verdict.
Either party may
ﬁle a motion for judgment in his favor, notwithstanding the fact that a ver

SEC. 8768. Arrest of judgment. Either party may ﬁle a motion in
arrest of judgment, where the pleadings of the prevailing party wholly fail

returned in his favor. 

SEC. 3759. Filing of motion. The ﬁling of either a motion for a new
trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in arrest of judgment,
shall not be a waiver of the right to ﬁle either or both of the others, but any
such motion shall be ﬁled within the time ﬁxed for the ﬁling of motions for
new trials.
SEC. 3760. Amendment to cure defect. Upon any motion for a new
trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in arrest of judgment,
the party whose pleading it is alleged is defective may, if the court consid
ers it necessary, ﬁle an amendment setting up the omitted facts, which, if
true, would remedy the alleged defects, and such amendment shall be ﬁled
before the hearing of the motion, and shall suspend the same. If the facts
thus stated would not, if proven, defeat the object of the motion, it shall be
sustained. If such new averments would, if proven, defeat its object and
are not admitted, they must be denied, or confessed and avoided, by the
opposite party within such time as the court shall direct, unless the same
are denied by legal operation, and in such case the law of pleading and pro
cedure shall apply, except that the amendment and response need not be
veriﬁed. 

SEC. 3761. Issues tried—judgment. If the facts thus pleaded are
admitted, the party pleading the same shall be entitled to such judgment as

pleading and admitted as proven on the trial, but, if controverted, there
shall be a trial of the issues raised by the new pleadings, and judgment
shall be rendered on the original verdict or ﬁnding, as modiﬁed or supple

tions named shall be entered on the record, and no new trial shall be granted
if he refuses to agree thereto.

SEC. 3764. An action may be dismissed, and

SEC. 3769. J’udg'ment—ﬂna.1 adjudication. Every ﬁnal adjudication
of the rights of the parties in an action is a judgment; and such adjudica

recovery of money only may, at any time after service of notice and before

rendered by the court accordingly. If the notice of acceptance is not given
in the period limited, the offer shall be treated as withdrawn, and shall not

if that sum would exceed double the amount of the claim for which an attach
ment is sued out, then in such sum as equals double the amount of such
claim, conditioned that such property or its appraised value shall be deliv
ered to the sheriff, to satisfy any judgment which may be obtained against
the defendant in that suit, within twenty days after the rendition thereof.

cases where a bond is to be given, unless the parties agree otherwise, the
sheriff shall summon two disinterested persons having the qualiﬁcation of

such persons disagree as to the value of the property, the sheriff shall
decide between them. 
SEC. 3911. Defense in action on delivery bond. In an action brought
upon such bond, it shall be a suﬁicient defense that the property for the de

fromseizure under suchattachment. 
SEC. 3912. Sale of perishable property. When the property attached
is in danger of immediate and serious waste or decay, or when the

any party to the action, the court or a judge thereof, upon such notice as it
or he may prescribe, may order the sale of any or all of such property.

has a just claim, and that the property has been or is about to be sold, con
cealed or removed from the state, or where plaintiff states on oath that he

the court the property will be so sold, concealed or removed, an attachment
may be granted against the property. 

SEC. 3915. Granted by court or judge-—terms. The attachment in
the cases mentioned in the last two sections may be granted by the court in

proper county, or of the attorney-general, that he verily believes that a
speciﬁc amount therein stated is justly due, and the defendant therein has
refused to pay or secure the same, and unless an attachment is issued
against the property of the defendant there is danger that the amount due
will be lost to the state. 
SEC. 3920. No bond required. The attachment so issued shall be
levied as in other cases of attachment, and no bond shall be required of

time each was summoned must be stated, with a copy of each notice of gar
nishment served attached as a part of his return. Where real property is
attached, the sheriff shall describe it with certainty to identify it, and,
where he can do so, by a reference to the book and page where the deed
under which the defendant holds is recorded. . He shall return with the
writ all bonds taken under it, any notice of claim to such property by
another than the defendant, any indemnifying bond given by the plaintiff
in consequence of such notice, and all money and bank bills levied upon or
paid to him thereunder. Such return must be made immediately after he

by oath to the court, disputing the validity of the attachment, or stating a
claim to the property or money, or to an interest in or lien on it, under any
other attachment or otherwise, and setting forth the facts upon which the
claim is founded; and the petitioner ’s claim shall be in a summary manner
investigated. The court may hear the proof or order a reference, or may
impanel a jury to inquire into the facts. If it is found that the petitioner
has a title to, a lien on or any interest in such property, the court shall make
such order as may be necessary to protect his rights. The costs of such
proceedings shall be paid by either party at the discretion of the court.

SEC. 3929. A motion may be made to discharge
the attachment or any part thereof, at any time before trial, for insuﬁiciency

attachment existed at the time it was issued; and the court shall give the
plaintiﬁ a reasonable time to perfect such defective proceedings.

SEC. 3943. Failure to appear or answer—ca.use shown. If duly
summoned, and his fees tendered when demanded, he fails to appear and
answer the interrogatories propounded to him without sufficient excuse, he

and property as is equal to the value of the property to be attached. 

SEC. 3946. Answer controverted. When the garnishee has answered
the interrogatories propounded to him, the plaintiif may controvert them by

the defendant in the main action, or for the delivery to the sheriﬁ of any
money or property in the garnishee’s hands belonging to the defendant in
the main action within a time to be ﬁxed by the court, and for the value of
the same, as ﬁxed in said judgment, if not delivered within the time thus

may, by a suitable pleading ﬁled in the garnishment proceedings, set up

parties thereto may be heard and determined on motion by the court, or a
judge thereof, upon such notice as may be prescribed by it or him.

SEC. 3973. Against municipal corporation-levy of tax. If no
pro
perty of a municipal corporation against which execution has issued can
be found, or if the judgment creditor elects not to issue execution against
such corporation, a tax must be levied as early as practicable to pay off the
judgment. When a tax has been so levied and any part thereof shall be
collected, the treasurer of such corporation shall pay the same to the clerk
of the court in which the judgment was rendered, in satisfaction thereof.

mortgage for any damages sustained by reason of such levy. [Same, § 2.]
SEC. 3982. Creditor subrogated. When such sum is paid to the holder
of the mortgage or deposited with the clerk, the attachment or execution

of the mortgage shall only receive the amount so stated to be due, and the sur
plus, if any, shall be returned to the person making the deposit. [Same, § 2.]
SEC. 3986. Indemnifying bond released. When the attaching or
execution creditor thus pays or deposits the amount of the claim under the
mortgage, he shall not be required to give an indemnifying bond on notice
to the sheriff by the holder of the mortgage of his right to the property
thereunder, or if one has been given, it shall be released.
SEC. 3986. Costs-—su.rp1us. If under execution sale the mortgaged
property does not sell for enough to pay the mortgage debt, interest and
costs of sale, the judgment creditor shall be liable for all costs thus made,
but if a greater sum is realized, the oﬁicer conducting the sale shall at once
pay to the mortgage holder the amount due thereunder, and apply the sur
plus on the execution. [21 G. A., ch. 117, § 3.]
SEC. 3987. Statement of indebtedness. For the purpose of enabling
the attaching or execution creditor to determine the amount to be tendered
or deposited to hold the levy under the writ of attachment or execution, the
person entitled to receive payment of the mortgage debt shall deliver to any
such person, upon written demand therefor, a statement in writing under
oath, showing the nature and amount of the original debt, the date and the
amount of each payment, if any, which has been made thereon, and an
itemized statement of the amount then due and unpaid. [Same, §§ 2, 5.]
SEC. 3988. Contest as to validity or amount. Lf the right of the
mortgagee to receive such or any sum is for any reason questioned by the
levying creditor, he may, within ten days after levy, or after demand is
made for a statement of the amount due as above provided, commence an
action in equity or contest such right upon ﬁling a bond in a penalty double
the amount of such mortgage, conditioned for the payment of any sum to be
found due to the person entitled thereto, with sureties to be approved by
the clerk, and if such mortgagee is a nonresident or his residence is unknown,
service may be made by publication as in other actions, but if such residence
becomes known before ﬁnal submission, the court may order personal service
to be made. If commenced at law, the court may transfer the same to the
equity side as in other cases. The court may appoint a receiver, and shall
determine the amount due on the mortgage, and all other questions properly
presented, and may continue and preserve or dismiss the lien of the levy,
the costs to be taxed to the losing party as in other cases. If there are two
or more mortgages, the creditor may admit the validity of one or more, and
make the required deposit as to such, and contest the other, and where there
are two or more such mortgages, each of which is questioned, a failure to
establish the invalidity of all shall not defeat the rights of the levying cred
itor, but in such case the decree shall determine the priority of liens, and
direct the order of payment out of the proceeds of the property which shall
be sold under special execution to be awarded in said cause; but nothing in
this chapter contained shall be construed to forbid or in any way aﬁect the
right of a creditor to contest in any other way the validity of any mortgage

SEC. 3989. Failure to make statement. A failure to make the state
ment, when required as above provided, shall have the effect to postpone
the lien of the mortgage and give the levy of the Writ of attachment or exe
cution priority over the claim of the holder thereof. [Same, § 6.]
SEC. 3990. Where mortgagee has been garnished. If the mortgagee,
before the levy of a writ of attachment or execution, has been garnished at
the suit of a creditor of the mortgagor, a creditor desiring to seize the mort
gaged property under a writ of attachment or execution shall pay to the
holder of the mortgage, or deposit with the clerk, in addition to the mort
gage debt, the sum claimed under the garnishment, and the provisions of
this chapter, so far as applicable, in all respects shall govern proceedings
relating thereto.
SEC. 3991. Indemnifying bond—notice of claim to property. An
oﬂicer is bound to levy an execution on any personal property in the posses
sion of, or that he has reason to believe belongs to, the defendant, or on
which the plaintiﬁ directs him to levy, unless he has received noticein
writing under oath from some other person, his agent or attorney, that such
property belongs to him; stating the nature of his interests therein, how
and from whom he acquired the same, and consideration paid therefor; or
from the defendant, that the property is exempt from execution; but failure
to give such notice shall not deprive the party of any other remedy. Or, if
after levy he receives such notice, such oﬂicer may release the property
unless a bond is given as provided in the next section; but the oﬂicer shall
be protected from all liability by reason of such levy until he receives such
written notice. 

SEC. 3992. Conditions of bond-return. When the ofﬁcer receives
such notice he may forthwith give the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, notice
that an indemnifying bond is required. Bond may thereupon be given by
or for the plaintiff, with one or more sufﬁcient sureties, to be approved by
the officer, to the effect that the obligors will indemnify him against the dam
ages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of the prop
erty, and will pay to any claimant thereof the damages he may sustain in
consequence of the seizure or sale, and will warrant to any purchaser of the
property such estate or interest therein as is sold; and thereupon the officer
shall proceed to subject the property to the execution, and shall return the
indemnify-
ing bond to the court from which the execution issued.

SEC. 3993. Failure to give bond. If such bond is not given, the
oﬁicer may refuse to levy, or if he has done so, and the bond is not given in
a reasonable time after it is required by the ofﬁcer, he may restore the prop
erty to the person from whose possession it was taken, and the levy shall
stand discharged.

SEC. 3994. Application of proceeds. Where property for the sale of
which the otﬁcer is indemniﬁed sells for more than enough to satisfy the
execution under which it was taken, the surplus shall be paid into the court
to which the indemnifying bond is directed to be returned. The court may
order such disposition or payment of the money to be made, temporarily or
absolutely, as may be proper in respect to the rights of the parties inter
ested. 
SEC. 8995. Executions byjustices. The provisions of the preceding sections, as to bonds, shall apply to proceedings upon executions issued
by justices of the peace. Indemnifying bonds shall be returned in such
cases with the execution under which they are taken.

the recovery of money, except those rendered on any appeal or writ of
error, or in favor of a laborer or mechanic for his wages, or against one
who is surety in the stay of execution, or against any oﬂicer, person or cor
poration, or the sureties of any of them, for money received in a ﬁduciary
capacity, or for the breach of any oﬁicial duty, there may be a stay of
execution, if the defendant therein shall, within ten days from the entry of
judgment, procure one 01' more suﬂicient freehold sureties to enter into a
bond, acknowledging themselves security for the defendant for the payment
of the judgment, interest and costs from the time of rendering judgment
until paid, as follows:
1. If the sum for which judgment was rendered, inclusive of costs, does
not exceed one hundred dollars, three months;
2. If such sum and costs exceed one hundred dollars, six months.

SEC. 3997. Aﬁdavit of surety. Olﬁcers approving stay bonds shall.
require the aﬁidavit of the signers thereof, unless waived in writing by the
party in whose favor the judgment is rendered, that they own property not
exempt from execution, and aside from incumbrance, to the value of twice
the amount of the judgment. 
SEC. 3998. Stay waives appeal. No appeal shall be allowed attera
stay of execution has been obtained.

SEC. 3999. Bond—approval—recording-—eﬁ‘ect. The sureties for
stay of execution may be taken and approved by the clerk, and the bond
shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose, and have the force and
effect of a judgment confessed from the date thereof against their property,
and shall be indexed in the proper judgment docket, as in case of other
judgments.

SEC. 4000. Execution recalled. When the bond is accepted and
approved after execution has been issued, the clerk shall immediately
notify the sheriff of the stay, and he shall forthwith return the execution
with his doings thereon. 
SEC. 4001. Property released. All property levied on or before stay
of execution, and all written undertakings for the delivery of personal prop
erty to the sheriff, shall be relinquished by the officer, upon stay of execu
tion being entered.
SEC. 4002. Execution against principal and sureties. At the expi
ration of the stay, the clerk shall issue a joint execution against the prop
erty of all the judgment debtors and sureties, describing them as debtors or
sureties therein, and the liability of such sureties shall be subject to that
of their principal as provided in this chapter. 

SEC. 4003. Objection by surety. \Vhen any court shall render judg
ment against two or more persons, any of whom is surety for any other in
the contract on which judgment is founded, there shall be no stay of execu
tion allowed, if the surety objects thereto at or before the time of rendering
the judgment, whereupon it shall be ordered by the court that there be no
stay, unless the surety for the stay of execution will undertake speciﬁcally
to pay the judgment in case the amount thereof cannot be levied of the prin
cipal defendant, and the judgment shall recite that the liability of such stay
is prior to that of the objecting surety.

SEC. 4004. Stay terminated by surety. Any surety for the stay of
execution may ﬁle with the clerk an afﬁdavit, stating that he verily believes
he will be compelled to pay the judgment, interest and costs thereon
unless execution issues immediately, and gives notice thereof in writing to
the party for whom he is surety; and the clerk shall thereupon issue execu
tion forthwith, unless other sufﬁcient surety be entered before the clerk
within ﬁve days after such notice is given as in other cases. 
SEC. 4006. Other security given. If other sufﬁcient surety is given,
it shall have the force of the original surety entered before the ﬁling of the
aﬂidavit, and shall discharge the original surety. 
SEC. 4006. Lien not released. Where a stay of execution has been
taken, such confessed judgment shall not release any judgment lien by vir
tue of the original judgment for the amount then due.

of the exemptions mentioned in this chapter does not waive his rights thereto

in writing by the oﬁicer about to levy thereon. 

SEC. 4018. Sending claims out of state to defeat exemption. Who
ever, whet-her as principal, agent or attorney, with intent to deprive a resi
dent in good faith of the state of the beneﬁt of the exemption laws thereof,

state for action, or causes action to be brought on such claim in another
state, or assigns or transfers such claim to a nonresident of the state, with
intent that action thereon be brought in the courts of another state, the

company, corporation, ﬁrm or person, the debts owing to employes for labor
performed within the ninety days next preceding the seizure or transfer of
such property, to an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars to each per
son, shall be a preferred debt and paid in full, or if there is not suﬁicient
realized from such property to pay the same in full, then, after the payment
of costs, ratably out of the fund remaining, but such preference shall be
junior and inferior to mechanics’ liens for labor in opening and developing
coal mines. 

SEC. 4020. Statement of c1a.im—a.1lowance. Any employe desiring
to enforce his claim for wages, at any time after seizure of the property
under execution or writ of attachment and before sale thereof is ordered,

subject, however, to the provisions of the preceding section. 
SEC. 4021. Contest. Any person interested may contest any claim or
part thereof by ﬁling objections thereto, supported by aﬂidavit, with such

against such property. [Same]
SEC. 4022. Priority. Claims of employes for labor, if not contested,

the oﬁicer may postpone the sale for not more than three days without being
required to give any further notice thereof, which postponement shall be

the parties in writing and made a part of the return upon the execution. 

SEC. 4030. Overplus. When the property sells for more than the
amount required to be collected, the overplus must be paid to the debtor,
unless the oﬁicer has another execution in his hands on which said overplus
may be rightfully applied, or unless there are liens upon the property which
ought to be paid therefrom, and the holders thereof make claim to such
surplus and demand application thereon, in which case the oﬂicer shall pay
the same into the hands of the clerk of the district court, and it shall be
applied as ordered by the court. 

SEC. 4031. If the property levied on sells for less than sufficient to satisfy the execution, the judgment holder may order

SEC. 4034. Sales vacated. When any person ‘shall
purchase at a
Sheriffs sale any real estate on which the judgment upon which the execu
tion issued was not a lien at the time of the levy, and which fact was
unknown to the purchaser, the court shall set aside such sale on motion,
notice having been given to the debtor as in case of action, and a new execu
tion may be issued to enforce the judgment, and, upon the order being made
to set aside the sale, the sheriff or judgment creditor shall pay over to the
purchaser the purchase money; said motion may also be made by any person
interested in the real estate.
SEC. 4035. 'Money—things in action. Money levied upon may be
appropriated without being advertised or sold, and so may bank bills, drafts,

SEC. 4036. Subjecting real estate of deceased judgment debtor.
When a judgment has been obtained against a decedent in his lifetime, the

to award execution against the same. 

SEC. 4037. Notice. The person against whom the petition is ﬁled shall

resident defendants may be had in such cases by publication. 
SEC. 4039. Execution awarded. At the proper time, the court shall
award the execution, unless suﬁicient cause is shown to the contrary, but
the non-age of the heirs or devisees shall not be held such sufﬁcient cause.
SEC. 4040. Mutual judgments-set oﬁ‘. Mutual judgments, execu
tions on which are in the hands of the same oﬁicer, may be set off the one
against the other, except the costs, but if the amount collected on the large
judgment is suﬁicient to pay the costs of both, such costs shall be paid there
from. 

SEC. 4041. Appraisement of personal property and leasehold inter
ests.
Personal property, and leasehold interests in real property having
less than two years of an unexpired term, levied upon and advertised for sale
on execution, must be appraised before sale by two disinterested householders
of the neighborhood, one of whom shall be chosen by the execution debtor
and the other by the plaintiff, or, in case of the absence of either party, or if
either or both parties neglect or refuse to make choice, the oﬁicer making
the levy shall choose one or both, as the case may be, who shall forthwith
return to said oﬁicer a just appraisement, under oath, of said property if
they can agree; if they cannot, they shall choose another disinterested house
holder, and with his assistance shall complete such appraisement, and the
property shall not, upon the ﬁrst offer, be sold for less than two-thirds of
said valuation; but if offered at the same place and hour of the day as adver
tised upon three successive days, and no bid is received equal to two-thirds.
of the app
raised value thereof, then it may be s'o1d for one-half of said val
uation. 

SEC. 4042. Property unso1d—1evy holds g-ood—additional levy-—
abandonment.
Subject to the provisions of the preceding section, when
property is unsold for want of bidders, the levy still holds good; and, if
there be suﬂicient time, it may again be advertised, or the execution returned
and one issued commanding the oﬁicer to sell the property, describing it,
previously levied on, to which a clause may be added that, if such property
does not produce a sum suﬂicient to satisfy such execution, the oﬁicer shall
proceed to make an additional levy, on which he shall proceed as on other
executions; or the plaintiﬁ may, in writing ﬁled with the clerk or justice,
abandon such levy, upon paying the costs thereof; in which case execution
may issue with the same eﬁect as if none had ever been issued. 

SEC. 4043. When sale absolute. When real property has been levied
upon, if the estate is less than a leasehold having two years of an unexpired
term, the sale is absolute, but if of a larger amount, it is redeemable as
hereinafter prescribed. [C.'73, §§ 3098-9; R., §§ 3329-30; C.’51, § 1924.]
SEC. 4044. Deed or certiﬁcate. If the property sold is not subject to
redemption, the sheriff must execute a deed therefor to the purchaser; but
if subject to redemption, a certiﬁcate, containing a description of the property
and the amount of money paid by such purchaser, and stating that, unles-<
redemption is made within one year thereafter, according to law, he or his
heirs or assigns will be entitled to a deed for the same. 

SEC. 4045. Redemption—by debtor—appea1 or stay. The debtor
may redeem real property at any time within one year from the day of sale,
and will, in the meantime, be entitled to the possession thereof; and for the
ﬁrst six months thereafter such right of redemption is exclusive; but no
party who has taken an appeal from the superior or district court, or stayed
execution on the judgment, shall be entitled to redeem.

SEC. 4046. By creditors. If no redemption is made by the debtor as
above provided, thereafter, and at any time within nine months from the
day of sale, said redemption may be made by a mortgagee before or after
the debt secured by the mortgage falls due, or by any creditor whose claim
becomes a lien prior to the expiration of the time allowed for such redemp
tion; but a mechanic’s lien before judgment thereon is not of such character
as to entitle the holder to redeem. The owner of a claim which has been
allowed and established against the estate of a decedent may redeem as in
this chapter provided, by making application to the district court or any
judge of the district where the real estate to be redeemed is situated. Such
application shall be heard after notice to such parties as said court or judge
may direct, and shall be determined with due regard to rights of all persons
interested. 

SEC. 4047. By creditors from each other. Creditors having the
right of redemption may redeem from each other within the time above lim
ited, and in the manner herein provided. 
SEC. 4048. Senior creditor. When a senior creditor thus redeems
from his junior, he is required to pay off only the amount of those liens
which are paramount to his own, with the interest and costs appertaining
to those liens. [C. ’73, 3' 3107; R., § 3337; C.’51, § 1931.]
SEC. 4049. Junior may prevent. The junior creditor may in all such
cases prevent a redemption by the holder of the paramount lien by paying
off the lien, or by leaving with the clerk beforehand the amount necessary
therefor, and a junior judgment creditor may redeem from a senior judgment
creditor. [C. ’73, §§ 3108-9; R., §§ 3338-9; C.’51, § 1932.]
SEC. 4050. Terms. The terms of redemption, when made by a cred
itor, in all cases shall be the reimbursement of the amount bid or paid by
the holder of the certiﬁcate, including all costs, with interest the same as
the lien redeemed from bears on the amount of such bid or payment, from
the time thereof, but where a mortgagee whose claim is not yet due is the
person from Whom the redemption is thus to be made, he shall receive on
such mortgage only the amount of the principal thereby secured, with unpaid
interest thereon to the time of such redemption.

SEC. 4051. The terms of redemption, when made by the title holder, shall be the 
payment into the clerk’s ofﬁce of the amount of the certificate, and all sums
paid by the holder thereof in eifecting
redemptions, added to the amount of his own lien, or the amount he has
credited thereon, if less than the whole, with interest at contract rate on
the certiﬁcate of sale from its date, and upon sums so paid by way of
redemption from date of payment, and upon the amount credited on his own
judgment from the time of said credit, in each case including costs. 

SEC. 4062. By junior from senior creditor. When a senior redeems
from a junior creditor, the latter may, in return, redeem from the former,
and so on, as often as the land is taken from him by virtue of a paramount

amount 01' value the original judgment or order, and all rents of or dam
ages to property during the pendency of the appeal out of the possession

intended to stay proceedings on only a. part of the judgment or order, it
shall be varied so as to secure the part stayed alone. When thus ﬁled and
approved, the clerk shall issue a written order requiring the appellec and
all others to stay all proceedings under such judgment or order, or so much
thereof as is superseded thereby, but no appeal or stay shall vacate or
aﬁect such judgment or order.

SEC. 4341. Deﬁnition. The action of mandamus is one brought
to obtain an order commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation or
person to do or not to do an act, the performance or omission of which the
law enjoins as a duty resulting from an ofﬁce, trust or station. Where dis
cretion is left to the inferior tribunal or person, the mandamus can only
compel it to act, but cannot control such discretion.

SEC. 4342. Order issued. The order may be issued by the district or
superior court to any inferior tribunal, or to any corporation, oﬁicer or per
son; and by the supreme court to any district or superior court, if necessary,
and in any other case where it is found necessary for that court to exercise
its legitimate power. 

SEC. 4343. Extent of remedy. The plaintiﬁ in any action, except
those brought for the recovery of speciﬁc real or personal property, may
also, as an auxiliary relief, have an order of mandamus to compel the per
formance of a duty established in such action. But if such duty, the per
formance of which is sought to be compelled, is not one resulting from an
oﬁice, trust or station, it must be one for the breach of which a legal right
to damages is already complete at the commencement of the action, and
must also be a duty of which a court of equity would enforce the perform
ance. 

SEC. 4344. Other remedy. An order of mandamus shall not be
issued in any case where there is a plain, speed; and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of the law, save as herein provided.
SEC. 4345. The order of mandamus is
granted on the petition of any private party aggrieved, without the concur
rence of the prosecutor for the state, or on the petition of the state by the
county attorney, when the public interest is concerned, and is in the name
of such private party or of the state, as the case may be in fact brought.

SEC. 4346. The plaintiff in such action shall state his claim,
and shall also state facts suﬁicient to constitute a cause for such claim, and
shall also set forth that the plaintiff, if a private individual, is personally
interested therein, and that he sustains and may sustain damage by thenon
performance of such duty, and that performance thereof has been demanded
by him, and refused or neglected, and shall pray an order of mandamus
commanding the defendant to fulﬁll such duty. 

SEC. 4347. Other pleadings. The pleadings and other proceedings
in any action in which a mandamus is claimed shall be the same, as nearly
as may be, and costs shall be recoverable by either
party, as in an ordinary
action for the recovery of damages.

SEC. 4348. When the action is
brought by a private person, it may be joined with a cause of action for
such an injunction as may be obtained by ordinary proceedings, or with the
causes of action speciﬁed in this chapter, but no other joinder and no coun
ter-claim shall be allowed. 

SEC. 4349. When the plaintiﬁ recovers judgment,
the court may include therein a peremptory order of mandamus directed to
the defendant, commanding him forthwith to
perform the duty to be
enforced, together with a money judgment for damages and costs, upon
which an ordinary execution may issue.

SEC. 4350. Return. The order shall simply command the performance
of the duty, shall be directed to the party, and may be issued in term or
vacation, returnable forthwith, and no return except that of compliance
shall be allowed; but time to return it may, upon suﬂicient grounds, be
allowed by
the court or judge, either with or without terms.
SEC. 4351. Performance by another—costs. The court may, upon
application of the plaintiff, besides or instead of proceeding against the
defendant by attachment, direct that the act required to be done may be
done by the plaintiif or some other person appointed by the court, at the
expense of the defendant, and, upon the act being done, the amount of such
expense may be ascertained by the court, or by a referee appointed by the
court or judge, and the court may render judgment for the amount of the
expgnse7an]d cost, and enforce payment thereof by execution. 
SEC. 4352. Temporary orders. During the pendency of the action,
the court, or judge in vacation, may make temporary orders for preventing
damage or injury to the plaintiﬁ until the action is decided. 
SEC. 4353. Appeal by state. When the state is a party, it may appeal
without security. 
SEC. 4364. When allowed. An injunction may be obtained as an
independent remedy in an action by equitable proceedings, in all cases
where such relief would have been granted in equity previous to the adop-
tion of the code; and in all cases of breach of contract or other injury,
where the party injured is entitled to maintain and has brought an action by
ordinary proceedings, he may, in the same cause, pray and have a writ of
injunction against the repetition or continuance of such breach of contract
or other injury, or the commission of any breach of contract or injury of a
like kind arising out of -the same contract or relating to the same property
or right, and he may also, in the same action, include a claim for damages
or other redress.

SEC. 4355. In any of the cases men
tioned in the preceding section, the injunction may either be a. part of the
judgment rendered in the action, or it may, if proper grounds therefor are
shown, be granted by order at any stage of the case before judgment, and
shall then be known as a temporary injunction. [C. ’73, § 3387; R., §3775;
C351, §2191.]
SEC. 4356. '1‘emporary—when allowed. Where it appears by the
petition therefor, which must be supported by aﬁidavit, that the plaintiff is
entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof, con
sists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act which would
produce great or irreparable injury to the plaintiff; or where, during litiga
tion, it appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do,
or is procuring or suﬁering to be done, some act in violation of the plaintiff ’s
rights respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judg
ment ineﬁectual, a temporary injunction may be granted to restrain such
act.
It may also be granted in any case where it is specially authorized by
statute. 

SEC. 4357. By whom granted. A temporary injunction may be
granted:

be brought;
2. By any judge of the district court of such district, or a superiorcourt
in the proper county;
3. By any judge of the supreme, or a judge of any other district court.
But in cases where an action is pending, and it is applied for to affect
the subject-matter thereof, it can only be granted by the court or judge
thereof in which such action is pending. Nor shall it be granted by any
judge mentioned in the second subdivision hereof, unless it satisfactorily
appears by aﬁidavit that the court or judge thereof in which the action is
brought cannot, for want of time, sickness, or other disability, hear the
same, or that the residence of the judge is inconvenient, or that it is for
some suﬂicient reason impracticable to make the application to him. Nor
shall it be granted by any judge mentioned in the third subdivision hereof,
unless it be made satisfactorily to appear to such judge, by aﬁidavit, that
the application therefor cannot, for some sufﬁcient reason, be made to either
of the courts or judges mentioned in the ﬁrst or second subdivision of this section. 

SEC. 4358. Notice to defendant who has answered. An injunction
shall not be granted against a defendant who has answered, unless he has
had notice of the application.
[o.’73, § 3390.]
SEC. 4359. Notice in other cases. An injunction to stop the general
and ordinary business of a. corporation, or the operations of a railway, or of
a municipal corporation, or the erection of any building or other work, or
the board of supervisors of any county, or to restrain a nuisance, can only
be granted upon reasonable notice of the time and place of the application
to the party to be enjoined; nor shall any temporary writ of injunction be
allowed by any judge during term time, except the petition therefor shall
be ﬁrst ﬁled with the clerk and entered upon the court calendar of that term,
and the order allowing the same, if granted, shall be entered therein

SEC. 4360. Refusal by court conclusive. No injunction shall be
granted by a judge after the application therefor has been overruled by
the court; nor by a. court or judge, when it has been refused by the court 01'

tion §sha.1l, if requested by either party, give him a certiﬁcate thereof. 

SEC. 4361. Motion to dissolve. The defendant may move to dissolvtj

ingly. If made by the judge, he must indorse the said order upon the P911‘

to issue only after the ﬁling of a bond in the oﬂice of the clerk of the PTOPQT

the clerk, and conditioned for the payment of all damages which mill’ be
adjudged against petitioner by reason of such injunction. 

SEC. 4364. When to restrain proceedings or judgment. When
proceedings in a civil action, or on a judgment or ﬁnal order, are sought to
be enjoined, the action must be brought in the county and court in which

taken to the supreme court.

SEC. 4365. In an action to enjoin the proceedings
in a civil action, or on a judgment or ﬁnal order, the bond must be further con

or modify the same, or the application may be made to the judge of the
court in which the action is pending. 
SEC. 4369. Notice-showing. The application must be with notice to
the plaintiff, upon the ground that the order was improperly granted, or it
may be founded on the answer of defendants and afﬁdavits. In the latter case,
the plaintiff may fortify his application by counter aﬂidavits, and have
reasonable time therefor.

SEC. 4370. The judge shall decide the matter at once,
unless some good cause for delay is shown, but the vacation of the order
shall not prevent the action from proceeding, if anything is left to proceed
upon.

SEC. 4371. Only one motion to dissolve or modify
an injunction upon the whole case shall be allowed.

agreed case alone, which must provide for any lien created for attachment,
and for any property in the custody of the law, else such lien and custody
will be held to be waived.

an agreement in writing that, upon the judgment of the court being given
on the question of law raised, particular property therein described, or a
sum of money ﬁxed by the parties or to be ascertained by the court or in

SEC. 4684. Depositions—when taken and by whom. After the com mencement
