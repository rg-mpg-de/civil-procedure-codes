petitioner such and the same relief as ought to have
been given by the Court of Chancery in a suit or
proceeding for the same or the like purpose properly

estate or right, or to relief upon any equitable ground
against any deed, instrument, or contract, or against
any right, title, or claim asserted by any plaintiff or
petitioner in such cause or matter, or alleges any
ground of equitable defence to any claim of the
plaintiff or petitioner in such cause or matter, the said
Courts respectively, and every Judge there, shall give
to every equitable estate, right, or ground of relief so
claimed, and to every equitable defence so alleged,
such and the same effect, by way of defence against

for the same or the like purpose before the passing
of this Act.

matter of equity, and also in respect of any legal
estate, right, or title claimed or asserted by him, all
such relief against any plaintiff or petitioner as such

ing, and as the said Cow-ts respectively, or any Judge
thereof, might have granted in any suit instituted
for that purpose by the same defendant against the
same plaintiff or petitioner ; and also all such relief
relating to or connected with the original subject of 
the cause or matter, and in like manner claimed 
against any other person, whether already a party to
the same cause or matter or not, who shall have been
duly served with notice in writing of such claim pur­
suant to any rule of Court or any order of the Court,
as might properly have been granted against such
person if he had been made a defendant to a cause
duly instituted by the same defendant for the like
purpose ; and every person served with any such
notice shall thenceforth be deemed a party to such
cause or matter, with the same rights in respect of his
defence against such claim as if he had been duly

shall recognise and take notice of all equitable
estates, titles, and rights, and all equitable duties

duly instituted therein before the passing of this
Act. 
( 5.) No cause or proceeding at any time pending in the
High Court of Justice, or before the Court of
Appeal, shall be restrained by prohibition or injunc­
tion ; but every matter of equity on which an in­
junction against the prosecution of any such cause or
proceeding might have been obtained, if this Act

terms or conditions, may be relied on by way of
defence thereto: Provided always, That nothing in

to the matters next hereinafter mentioned : Be it enacted as 
follows: 
.Administration of .Assets of Insolvent Estates. 
( 1.) In the administration by the Court of the assets of
any person who may die after the passing of this
Act, and whose estate may prove to be insufficient
for the payment in fnll of his debts and liabilities,
the same rules shall prevail and be observed as to
the respective rights of secured and unsecured credi­
tors, and as to debts and liabilities proveable, and as
to the valuation of annuities and future or contingent
liabilities, respectively, as may be in force for the
time being under the law of bankruptcy with respect
to the estates of persons adjudged bankrupt ; and
all persons who in any such case would be entitled
to prove for and receive dividends out of the estate
of any such deceased person may come in under the
decree or order for the administration of such estate
and make such claims against the same as they may
respectively be entitled to by virtue of this Act. 
Statutes of Limitation inapplicable to express trusts. 
( 2.) No claim of a cestui que trust against his trustee for
any property held on an express trust, or in respect
of any breach of such trust, shall be held to be 
(3.) 
barred by any statute of li~itations. 
Equitable Waste. 
An estate for life without impeachment of waste shall
not confer or be deemed to have conferred upon the
tenant for life any legal right to commit waste of the
description known as equitable waste, unless an in­
tention to confer such right shall expressly appear
by the instrument creating such estate. 
Me1·ger. 
( 4.) There shall not, after the commencement of this Act,
be any merger by operation of law only of any estate,
the beneficial interest in which would not be deemed
to be merged or extinguished in equity, 
Suits for Possession of land by Mortgagors. 
( 5.) A mortgagor entitled for the time being to the pos­
session or receipt of the rents and profits of any land
as to which no notice of his intention to take posses­
sion or to enter into the receipt of the rents and
profits thereof. shall have been given by the mort­
gagee, may sue for such possession, or for the recovery
of such rents or profits, or to prevent or recover
damages in respect of any trespass or other wrong
relative thereto, in his own name only, unless the
cause of action arises upon a lease or other contract
made by him jointly with any other person. 
Assignment of debts and choses in action, 
(6.) Any absolute assignment, by writing under t!.te band
of the assignor ( not purporting to be by way of
charge only), of any debt or other legal chose in
action, of which express notice in writing shall have
been given to the debtor, trustee, or other person
from whom the assignor would have been entitled to
receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall
be, and be deemed to have been, eft'ectual in law
(subject to all equities which would have been 
entitled to priority over the right of the assignee if
this Act had not been passed) to pass and transfer
the legal right to such debt or chose in action from
the date of such notice, and all legal and other
remedies for the same, and the power to give a good
discharge for the same, without the concurrence of
the assignor: Provided always, That if the debtor,
trustee, or other person liable in respect of such debt 
or chose in action shall have had notice that such 
(7.) 
assignment is disputed by the assignor or any one
claiming under him, or of any other opposing or con­
flicting claims to such debt or chose in action, he
shall be entitled, if he think fit, to call upon the
several persons making claim thereto to interplead
concerning the same, or he may, if he think fit, pay
the same into the High Court of Justice under and
in conformity with the provisions of the Acts for the
relief of trustees. 
Stipulations not of the essence of Contracts. 
Stipulations in contracts, as to time or otherwise,
which would not before the passing of this Act have
been deemed to be or to have become of the essence

all Courts the same construction and effect as they
would have heretofore received in equity. 
Injunctions and Receivers. 
(8.) A mandamus or an injunction may be granted or o.
receiver appointed ~y an interlocutory order of the 
Court in all cases in which it shall appear to the

either unconditionally or upon such terms and con­
ditions as the Court shall think just ; and if an
injunction is asked, either before, or at, or after the
hearing of any cause or matter, to prevent any
threatened or apprehended waste or trespass, such
injunction may be granted, if the Court shall think
fit, whether the person against whom such injunction
is sought is or is not in possession under any claim
of title or otherwise, or (if out of possession) does or
does not claim a right to do the act sought to be.
restrained under any colour of title; and whether the
estates claimed by both or by either of the parties
are legal or equitable. 
Damages by Collisions at Sea.
(9.) In any cause or proceeding for damages arising out 
of a collision between two ships, if both ships shall
. be found to have been in fault, the rules hitherto in 
force in the Court of Admiralty, so far as they have
been at variance with the rules in· force in the Courts 
of Common Law, shall prevail.

( 10.) In questions relating to the custody and education
of infants the Rules of Equity shall prevail. 
Cases of Conflict not enumerated.

may be assigned under this Act ; but in all other cases in
which, under the law now existing, the terms into which the
legal year is divided are used as a measure for determining
the time at or within which any act is required to be done,
the same may continue to be referred to for the same or the 
like purpose, unless and until provision is otherwise made 
by any lawful authority. Subject to Rules of Court, the High
Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal, and the Judges
