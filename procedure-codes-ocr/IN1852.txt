SEC. 16. If the person so admitted be guilty of any improper conduct, or of any unjustifiable delay in the progress of such action, the court may, in its discretion, annul such order, and he shall thereafter be deprived of all benefit of the order admitting him to prosecute or defend as such poor person.

the action shall be continued in the name of the original party;
or, the court may allow the person to whom the transfer is
made to be substituted in the action.

SEC. 22. The court may determine any controversy between the parties before it, when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights; but

when a complete determination of the controversy cannot be
had, without the presence of other parties, the court must
cabse them to be joined as proper parties. And when, in an
action for the recovery of real or personal property, a person

shall notify the defendant of the action commenced, the parties
thereto, and the court where pending. t

action, and the term at which the same will stand for trial,

be printed therein, then in the county in this State nearest
thereto in which any such newspaper is printed, in either
of the following cases, shown by affidavit:

First. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, and
has property within the State, or the cause of action arose

law, or the object of the action is to enforce or discharge a
lien, or to obtain a divorce. w

Sec. 39. When the defendant is a non-resident, personal
service of the summons out of the State is equivalent to
publication, and such service may be proved by the aflidavit
of a competent person, made before any otiicer authorized

place, and mode of giving the notice, and set forth that the
person thus served with notice is the identical person named

them without naming them: and the court shall make such
order respecting notice, and the publication thereof, as may
be deemed proper.

Sec. 41. Where the action is against two or more defendants, and the summons is served on one or more, but not all
of them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows:

First. If the action be against defendants jointly indebted
on contract, he may proceed against the defendant served,
and if he recover jud ment, it may be enforced against the
joint property of al , and the separate property of the
defendant served; or, a

Second. If the action be ainst defendants severally
liable, he may proceed against t e defendants served in the
same manner as if they were the only defendants, and may
afterwards proceed against those not served.

Third. If all the defendants have been served, judgment
may be taken against any or either of them severally when
the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against such
defendant or defendants, if the action had been against them

any of the defendants, such return shall be suggested on the
record, and the plaintiff may continue the cause as to them

time withinfive years after the rendition of the judgment,

of several causes of action being improperly united in the
same complaint, the court shall order the misjoinder to be
noted on the order book, and cause as many separate actions
to be docketed between the parties as there are causes decided
by the court to be improperly joined; and each shall stand

real property.

pleadings to the facts proved; when the amendment does not
substantially change the claim or defense. The court may
also, in its discretion, allow a party to file his pleadings after
the time limited therefor; and at any time within one year
relieve a party from a judgment taken against him through

o the contract; and the purchase-money due on such contract, when recovered by the executor, shall be paid to the
devisees.

SEC. 7. An incumbrance upon any estate, shall not be
deemed a revocation of any devise of such estate previously
executed, but the devises and legacies relating thereto shall be
subject to such incumbrance.

Sec. 8. If, after having executed a will, devising any
property, any testator shall make a conveyance of his interest
therein, and shall take back a new estate therein, such new
estate shall pass by his will to the person to whom the original
estate or interest was devised, unless it shall appear from such
will, or by the conveyance of his estate, or interest therein,
or by the instrument by the force of which such new estate
is taken back, that the testator intended that such conveyance
should operate as a revocation of such devise.

Sec. 9. A conveyance, settlement, deed or other act of a
testator, by which his estate or interest in property previousl

not be deemed a revocation of such devise; but the same
shall pass to the devisee or legatee, the actual estate or interest
of the testator, which woul otherwise descend to his heirs;
unless such devise shall be otherwise revoked, or unless in the
instrument by which such alteration is made, the intention is
declared that it shall operate as a revocation of such previous

not performed, or such contingency do not happen.

Sec. 10. When any estate, real or personal, that is devised,

}shall be taken, in whole or in part, from the devisee for the

debts with the others, or shall [have] by any provision in his
will, required any appropriation of his estate, or any part of it,
for the payment of his debts, different from that prescribed in
this section, in which case the estate shall be applied in conformity with the provisions of the will.

Sec. 11. Whenever any part of the real estate of a testator
is left undevised, by his will, and his personal estate shall be
insufficient for the payment of his debts, the undevised real
estate shall be first chargeable with debts, in exoneration, as

assets for the payment of his debts was made b the testator,
when they shall, for that pur se, be disposed o in conformity
with the provisions of the will?

Sec. 12. Nothing herein contained, shall, in any way,

of his debts.

Sec. 13. Whenever any estate, real or personal, shall be
devised to any decedent of the testator, and such devisee shall

lapse, but the property so devised shall vest in the surviving
descendant of the devisee, as if such devisee had survived the

Sec. 14. The naming of any executor in a will, shall not
operate as a discharge of an just claim which the testator

estate, or any part thereof, and any of his real estate subject
to a mortgage, executed by such testator, shall descend to an

discharged as ‘follows:

First. If such testator- shall have char ed any particular
part of his estate, real or personal, with the payment of his
debts, such mortgage shall be considered a part of such debts.

Second. If the will contains no direction as to what part of
his estate shall be taken for the ayment of his debts, and any

the probate thereof.

Sec. 19. No will in writing, nor any part thereof, except
