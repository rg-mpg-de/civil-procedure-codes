or claims, an interest in the controversy adverse to the
plaintiff, or who is a necessary party to a complete deter­
mination or settlement of the question involved therein. 
SEc. 37. Of the parties to the action, those who are
united in interest must be joined, as plaintiffs or defend­
ants; but if the consent of' one who should have been
joined as plaintiff cannot be obtained, he may be made a 
defendant, the reason being stated in the petition. 
SEC. 38. When the question is one of common or general

action, at the option of the plaintiff. 
SEC. 40. An action does not abate by the death or other
disability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest
therein, during its pendency, if the cause of action survive
or continue. In case of the death or other disability of a
party, the court may allow the action to continue by or
against his representative or successor in interest. In case
of any other transfer of interest, the action may be con-
tinued in the name of the original party, or the court may
allow the person to whom the transfer is made, to be sub-
stituted in the action. 
SEc: 41. The court may determine any controversy
between parties before it, when it can be done without 
prejudice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights;
but when a determination of the controversy cannot be
had without the presence of other parties, the court must
order them to be brought in. 
SEC. 42. When, in an action for the recovery of real or
personal property, any person having an interest in the 
property applies to be made a party, the court may order
it to be done. 
SEC. 43. Upon affidavit of a defendant, before answer,
in any action upon contract, or for the recovery of per- 
sonal property, that some third party, without collusion
with him, has or makes a claim to the subject of the action, 
and that he is ready to pay or dispose of the same, as the
court may direct, the court may make an order for the
safe-keeping, or for the payment, or deposit in court, or
delivery of the subject of the action, to such person as it may
direct, and an order requiring such third party to appear,
in a reasonable time, and maintain or relinquish bis claim
against the defendant. If such third party, being served
with a copy of the order, by the sheriff, or such other
person as the court may direct, fail to appear, the court
may declare him barred of all claim in respect to the
subject of the action, against the defendant therein. If 
such third party appear, he shall be allowed to make 
himself defendant in the action, in lieu of the original
defendant, who shall be discharged from all liability to 
either of the other parties in respect to the subject of the
action, upon his compliance with the order of the court
for the payment, deposit or delivery thereof. 
SEc. 44. The provisions of the last section shall be
applicable to an action brought against a sheriff or other 
officer, for the recovery of personal property, taken by
him under execution, or for the proceeds of such property 
so taken and sold by him ; and the defendant in any such
action shall be entitled to the benefit of those provisions 
against the party in whose favor the execution issued,
upon exhibiting to the court the process under which he
acted, with his affidavit that the property, for the recovery
of which, or its proceeds, the action is brought, was taken
under such process. 
SEc. 45. In an action against a sheriff or other officer, 
~1ort e recovery o property ta en un eran execution an

substituted as the defendant, security for the cost being 
given.

in a newspaper, may, at any time within three years after
the date of the judgment or order, have the same opened,
and be let in to defend. Before the judgment or order
shall be opened, the applicant shall give notice to the ad­
verse party of his intention to make such an application,
and shall file a full answer to the petition, pay all costs,
if the court require them to be paid, and make it appear 
to the satisfaction of the court, by affidavit, that during
the pendency of the action he had no actual notice thereof 
in time to appear in court and make his defense ; but the title to any property, the subject of the judgment or order
sought to be opened, which, by it, or in consequence of it,
shall have passed to a purchaser in good faith, shall not 
be affected by any proceedings under this section, nor shall
they affect the title of any property sold before judgment 
under an attachment. The adverse party, on the hearing
of an application to open a judgment or order, as provided
by this section, shall be allowed to present counter affida­
vits to show that during the pendency of the action the 
applicant had notice thereof in time to appear in court
and make his defense. 
SEc. 78. In actions where it shall be necessary to make
the heirs or devisees of any deceased person defendants,
and it shall appear by the affidavit of the plaintiff, 
annexed to his petition, that the names of such heirs or
devisees, or any of them, and their residence, are un­
known to the plaintiff, proceedings may be had against
such unknown heirs or devisees, without naming them ;
and the court shall make such order respecting service as
may be deemed proper. If service by publication be
ordered, the publication shall not be less than three weeks. 
SEC. 79. Where the action is against two or more de­
fendants, and one or more shall have been served, but not 
all of them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows : First, 
If the action be against defendants jointly indebted upon
contract, he may proceed against the defendants served,
unless the court otherwise direct ; and if he recover judg­
ment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus
jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced
against the joint property of all, and the separate prop­
erty of the defendants served ; and if they are subject to 
arrest, against the persons of the defendants served. Sec­
ond, If the action be against defendants severally liable,
he may, without prejudice to his rights against those not
served, proceed against the defendants served in the same
manner as if they were the only defendants. 
SEC. 80. Nothing in this code shall be so construed as 
to make a judgment, against one or more defendants
jointly or severally liable, a bar to another action against 
those not served.
SEc. 81. When the petition has been filed, the action is 
pending, so as to charge third persons with notice of its
pendency, and while pending no interest can be acquired 
by third persons in the subject matter thereof as against
the plaintiff's title; but such notice shall be of no avail
unless the summons be served or the first publication made
within sixty days after the filing of the petition. 
SEc. 82. When any part of real property, the subject
matter of an action, is situated in any other county or
counties than the one in which the action is brought, a
certified copy of the judgment in such action must be
recorded in the office of the register of deeds of such other 
county or counties, before it shall operate therein as notice
so as to charge third persons, as provided in the preceding section. It shall operate as such notice, without record, in
the county where it is rendered.

in the same petition, whether they be such as have hereto-

they all arise out of either one of the following classes : 
First, The same transaction, or transactions, connected 
with the same subject of action. Second, Contracts, ex­

SEC. 84. The pleadings are -the written statements, by
the parties, of the facts constituting their respective claims 
and defenses.
SEc. 85. The rules of pkading heretofore existing in
civil actions are abolished ; and hereafter, the forms of
pleading in civil actions in courts of record, and the rules 
by which their sufficiency may be determined, are those
prescribed by this code. 
SEc. 86. The only pleadings allowed are: First, The
petition by the plaintiff. Second, The answer or demurrer 
by the defendant. Third, The demurrer or reply by the
plaintiff. Fourth, The demurrer or reply by the defendant. 
SEC. 87. The petition must contain: First, The name of
the court, and the county in which the action is brought, 
and the names of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, fol-
lowed by the word '' petition." Second, A statement of 
the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and/'-'
concise language, and without repetition. Third, A de- 
mand of the relief to which the party supposes himself
entitled. . If the recovery of money be demanded, the 
amount thereof shall be stated ; and, if interest thereon'
be claimed, the time from which interest is to be computed
shall be also stated. 
SEc. 88. Where the petition contains more than one
cause of action, each shall be separately stated and num- 
bered. 
SEc. 89. The defendant may demur to the petition only
when it appears on its face, either: First, That the court 
has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, or the
subject of the action. Second; That the plaintiff has not 
legal capacity to sue. Third, That there is another action
pending between the same parties for the same cause.
Fourth, That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or de­
fendant. Fiftlt, That several causes of action are improp­
erly joined. Sixth, That the petition does not state facts
sufficient t-0 constitute a cause of action. 
SEC. 90. The demurrer shall specify distinctly the
grounds of objection to the petition. Unless it do so, it
shall be regarded as objecting only that the petition does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
SEc. 91. When any of the defects enumerated in section
eighty-nine do not appear upon the face of the petition,
the objection may be taken by answer; and if no objec­
tion be taken, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant 
shall be deemed to have waived the same, except only the
objection to the jurisdiction of the court, and that the pe­
tition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. 
SEc. 92. When a demurrer is sustained, on the ground
of misjoinder of several causes of action, the court, on
motion of the plaintiff, shall allow him, with or without
costs, in its discretion, to file several petitions, each includ­
ing such of said causes of action as might have 'been
joined; and an action shall be docketed for each of said
petitions, and the same shall be proceeded in without fur­ 
ther service. 
SEc. 93. The defendant may demur to one or more of
the several causes of action stated in the petition, and
answer to the residue. 
ANSWER. 
SEc. 94. The answer shall contain : Fir st, A general or
specific denial of each material allegation of the petition 
controverted by the defendant. Second, A statement of
any new· matter constituting a defense, counter-claim or
set-off, or a right to relief concerning the subject· of the
action, in ordinary and concise language, and without rep­
etition. Tldrd, When relief is sought, the nature of the
relief to which the defendant supposes himself entitled.
The defendant may set forth, in his answer, as many
grounds of defense, counter-claim, set-off, and for relief, as
he may have, whether they be such as have been hereto­
fore denominated legal, or equitable, or both. Each must
be separately stated and numbered, and they must refer, 
in an intelligible manner, to the causes of action which
they are intended to answer. 
SEC. 95. The counter-claim mentioned in the last section
must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against 
a. plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be
had in the action, and arising out of the contract or trans- 
action set forth in the petition as the foundation of the/.,.
plaintiff's claim, or connected with the su bject of the 
action. The right to relief concerning the subject of the
action, mentioned in the same section, must be a right to
relief necessarily or properly involved in the action for a
complete determination thereof, or settlement of the ques- 
tion involved therein. 
SEc. 96. If the defendant omit to set up a counter-claim
or set-off, he cannot recover costs against the plaintiff in 
any subsequent action thereon; but this section shall not
apply to causes of action which are stricken out of or 
withdrawn from the answer, as in sections ninety-seven
and one hundred and twenty. 
SEC. 97. When it appears that a new party is necessary 
to a final decision upon a counter-claim, the court may
eitheJ permit the new party to be made by a summons, to 
reply to the counter-claim, or may direct the counter-claim 
to be stricken out of the answer, and made the subject of
a separate action. 
SEC. 98. A set-off can only be pleaded in an action
founded on contract, and must be a cause of action arising 
upon contract or ascertained by the decision of a court. 
SEc. 99. When it appears that a new party is necessary 
to a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit
the new party to be made, if it also appear that, owing to
the insolvency or non-residence of the plaintiff, or other
cause, the defendant will be in danger of losing his claim,
unless permitted to use it as a set-off. 
SEC. 100. When cross demands have existed between
persons under such circumstances that, if one had brought 
an action against the other, a counter-claim or set-off
could have been set up, neither can be deprived of the 
benefit thereof by the assignment or death of the other;
but the two demands must be deemed compensated so far
as they equal each other. 
SEc. 101. The guardian of an infant or person of un­
sound mind, or attorney for a person in prison, shall deny, 
in the answer, all the material allegations of the petition
prejudicial to such defendant. 
SEc. 102. When the answer contains new matter, the
plaintiff may reply to such new matter, denying, generally
or specifically, each allegation controverted by him ; and 
he may allege, in ordinary and concise language, and
without repetition, any new matter not inconsistent with
the petition, constituting a defense to such new matter in the 
answer ; or he may demur to the same for insufficiency,
stating, in his demurrer, the grounds thereof; and he may 
demur to one os more of such defenses set up in the
answer, and reply to the residue. 
SEc. 103. If the reply to any defense set up by the
answer be insufficient, the defendant may demur thereto, 
stating the grounds of such demurrer. 
SEc. 104. When the answer contains new matter consti­
tuting a right to relief against a co-defendant concerning
the subject of the action, such co-defendant may demur
or reply to such matter in the same manner as if he were
plaintiff, and subject to the same rules, as far as ap~lica­ 
ble.  
SEC. 105. The answer or demurrer, by the defendant,
shall. be filed within twenty days after the day on which 
the summons is returnable; the reply or demurrer shall
be filed within thirty days after the day op which the
summons was made returnable ; the demurrer to the reply 
shall be filed within forty days after the day on which the
summons was made returnable. · · 
SEC. 106. The court, or any judge thereof in vacation,
may, in his discretion, and upon such terms as may be 
just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other act to 
be done, after the time limited by this act, or by an order
enlarge such time. 
SEc. 107. Every pleading, in a court of record, must be
subscribed by the party or his attorney. 
SEC. 108. In all actions, allegations of the execution of
written instruments and indorsements thereon, of the
existence of a corporation or partnership, or of any a p­
pointment or authority, shall be taken as true, unless the
denial of the same be verified by the affidavit of the party,
his agent or attorney. 
SEc. 109. The verification mentioned in the last section
shall not be required to the answer of a guardian defend- 
ing for an infant or person of unsound mind, or a person
imprisoned. 
SEC. 110. If there be several persons united in interest
and pleading together, the affidavit may be made by any 
one of such parties. When a municipal or other corpora-
tion is a party, the verification may be made by an officer 
thereof, its agent or attorney.
SEC. 111. The affidavit shall be sufficient if it state that 
the affiant believes the facts stated in the pleading to be 
true. 
SEc. 112. In all cases where the party pleading is a
non-resident of the county in which the action is brought,
or if he shall be absent from the county where the plead-
ing is filed, an affidavit, made before filing the pleading,
stating the substance of the facts afterward inserted in the
pleading, shall be a sufficient verification. Such affidavit
shall be filed with the pleading intended tc > be verified
thereby.
SEc. 113. The affidavit verifying pleadings may be made
before any person before whom a deposition might be 
taken, and must be signed by the party making the same;
and the officer before whom the same was taken shall 
certify that it was sworn to or affirmed before him, and
signed in his presence. The certificate of such officer,
signed officially by him, shall be evidence that the affida-
vit was duly made, that the name of the officer was written
by himself, and that he was such officer. 
SEC. 114. When the affidavit is made by the agent or
attorney, it must set forth the reason why it is not made
by the party himself. It can be made by the agent or 
attorney only: First, When the facts are within the per-
sonal knowledge of the agent or attorney. Second, When
the plaintiff is an infant, or of unsound mind, or impris-
oned. Third, When the pleading to be verified is founded
upon a written instrument for the payment of money only,
and such instrument is in the possession of the agent or
attorney. Fourth, When the party is not a resident of,
or is absent from, the county. 
SEC. 115. In the construction of any pleading, for the
purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice 
bet~~: the parties.
SEc. 116. All fictions in pleadings are abolished. 
SEC. 117. The title of a cause shall not be changed in
any of its stages. 
SEC. 118. If the action, counter-claim or set-off be
founded on account, or on a note, bill or other written 
instrument, as evidence of indebtedness, a copy thereof
must be attached to and filed with the pleading. If not
so attached and filed, the reason thereof must be shown
in the pleading. 
SEC. 119. If redundant or irrelevant matter be inserted
in any pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of the
party prejudiced thereby ; and when the allegations of a
pleading are so indefinite and uncertain that the precise
nature of the charge or defense is not apparent, the court
may require the pleading to be made definite and certain
by amendment. 
SEC. 120. The court, at any time before the final sub­
mission of the cause, on motion of the defendant, may 
allow a counter-claim or set-off, set up in the answer, to
be withdrawn, and the same may become the subject of 
another action; on motion of either party, to be made at
the time such counter-claim or set-off is withdrawn, an
action on the same shall be docketed and proceeded in, as
in like cases after process served ; and the court shall
direct the time and manner of pleading therein. If an
action be not so docketed, it may afterward be commenced
in the ordinary way. 
SEC. 121. In pleading a judgment, or other determina-
tion of a court or officer of' special jurisdiction, it shall be 
"sufficient to state that such judgment or determination
was duly given or made ; and the jurisdiction of any such
court or officer shall be presumed until the contrary ap­
pears. 
SEc. 122. In pleading the performance of conditions
precedent in a contract, it shall be sufficient to state that
the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; 
and if such allegations be controverted, the party pleading
must establish, on the trial, the facts showing such per­
formance. 
SEC. 123. In an action, counter-claim or set-off, founded
upon an account, promissory note, bill of exchange or
other instrument, for the unconditional payment of money
only, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a copy of the
account or instrument, with all credits, and the Indorse- 
ments thereon, and to state that there is due to him, on
such account or instrument, from the adverse party, a 
specified sum, which he claims, with interest . ., When
others than the makers of a promissory note, or the 
acceptors of a bill of exchange, are parties in the action,
it shall be necessary to state, also, the kind of liability of
the several parties, and the facts, as they may be, which
fix their liability. 
SEC. 124. In pleading a private statute, or a right de-<:-:1~~nr1n1e
rived therefrom, it.shall be sufficient to refer to such statute 
by its title, and the day of its approval, and_ ~e court
shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof. I %1 ... "' 
SEc. 125. In an action for libel or slander, it .. ~hall be
sufficient to state, generally, that the defamatory matter
was pn blished or spoken of the plaintiff; and if the
allegation be denied, the plaintiff must prove, on the trial, 
the facts, showing that the defamatory matter was pub-
lished or spoken of him. 
SEc. 126. In the actions mentioned in the last section,
the defendant may allege the truth of the matter charged 
as defamatory, and may prove the same, and any miti-
gating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages,
or he may prove either. 
SEC. 127. In any action for the recovery of real property,
it shall be described with such convenient certainty as will 
enable an officer holding an execution to identify it. 
SEC. 128. Every material allegation of the petition, not 
con ove y e answer, an every ma ria a ega ion
of new matter in the answer, not controverted by the re- 
ply, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as
true; but the allegation of new matter in the reply shall
be deemed to be controverted by the adverse party, as
upon direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require ..
A demurrer to a reply shall not be held to admit any of
the facts alleged in such reply for any purpose other than 
to determine the sufficiency thereof. Allegations of value,
or of amount of damages, shall not be considered as true,
by failure to controvert them ; but this shall not apply to 
the amount claimed in actions on contract, express or im-
plied, for the recovery of money only. 
SEC. 129. A material allegation, in a pleading, is one
essential to the claim or defense, which could not be
stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient. 
SEC. 130. Neither presumptions of law nor matters of 
which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in the
pleading. 
SEC. 131. When a tender of money is alleged in any
pleading, it shall not be necessary to deposit the money in 
court when the pleading is filed, but it shall be sufficient
if the money is deposited in court at the trial, or when
ordered by the court. 
SEc. 132. If an original pleading be lost, or withheld
by any person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be 
substituted.
SEC. 183. Novariancebetweentheallegations, in a plead-
ing, and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it have 
actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in
maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. "\Vhen-
ever it is alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact
must be proved to the satisfaction of the. court, and it
must also be shown in what respect he has been misled, 
and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be
amended, upon such ternis as may be just. 
SEc. 134. When the variance is not material, as provided
in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be
found, according to the evidence, and may order an imme­
diate amendment without cost. 
SEc. 135. When, however, the allegation of the claim or
defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not
in some particular or particulars only, but in its general
scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of vari-
ance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof. 
SEc. 136. The plaintiff may amend his petition without
leave, at any time before the answer is filed, without preju­
dice to the proceedings ; but notice of such amendment
shall be served upon the defendant or his attorney, and the
defendant shall have the same time to answer or demur
thereto as to the original petition. 
SEC. 137. At any time within ten days after the demurrer
is filed, the adverse party may amend, of course, on pay­
ment of costs since filing the defective pleading. Notice 
of the filing of an amended pleading shall be forthwith
served upon the other party or his attorney, who shall
have the same time thereafter to answer or reply thereto,
as to an original pleading. 
SEC. 138. Upon a demurrer being overruled, the party 
who demurred may answer or reply, if the court be satis-
fled that he has a meritorious claim or defense, and did 
not demur for delay. 
SEC. 139. The court may, before or after judgment, in
furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be
proper, amend any pleading, process or proceeding by
adding or striking out the name of any party, or correct-
ing a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any 
other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to
the case, or conform the pleading or proceeding to the 
facts proved, when such amendment does not change sub-
stantially the claim or defense ; and when any proceeding
fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this 
code, the court may permit the same to be made conform-
able thereto by amendment. /,- 
SEC. 140. The court, in every stage of action, must dis-
regard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings
which does not affect the substantial rights of the ad verse 
party; and no judgment shall be reversed or affected by
reason of such error or defect.
SEC. 141. If the demurrer be snstalned, the adverse party
may amend, if the defect can be remedied by way of 
amendment, with or without costs, as the court, in its dis­
cretion, shall direct. 
SEC. 142. When either party shall amend any pleading
or proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit 
or otherwise, that the adverse party could not be ready
for trial in consequence thereof, a continuance may be
granted to some day in term, or to another term of the 
court. 
SEC. 143. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the
name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated, in 
any pleading or proceeding, by any name or description;
and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding may be amended accordingly. The plaintiff,
in such case, must state in his petition that he could not
ascertain the true name ; and the summons must contain 
the words, '' real name unknown,'' and a. . copy thereof
must be served personally upon the defendant. 
SEc. 144. Either party may be allowed, on notice, and
on such terms, as to costs, as the court may prescribe, to 
file a supplemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts
material to the case, occw;ring after the former petition,
answer or reply. 
SEc. 145. Whenever two or more actions are pending in
the same court, which might have been joined, the defend­
ant may, on motion and notice to the adverse party, re­
quire him to show cause why the same shall not be con­
solidated, and if no cause be shown, the said several
actions shall be consolidated. 
SEc. 146. The order for consolidation may be made by
the court, or by a judge thereof, in vacation.

meanors or offenses. 
SEC. 148. An order for the arrest of the defendant shall

amount thereof, as nearly as may be, and showing one or
more of the following particulars: First, That the de­
fendant has removed, or begun to remove, any of his
property out of the jurisdiction of the court, with intent
to defraud his creditors. Second, That he has begun to 
convert his property, or a part thereof, into money, for the
purpose of placing it beyond the reach of his creditors. 
Third, That he has property, or rights of action, which
he fraudulently conceals. Fourth, That he has assigned,
removed or disposed of, or has begun to dispose of, his
property, or a part thereof, with intent to defraud his 
creditors. Fifth, That he fraudulently contracted the
debt, or incurred the obligation, for which suit is about to 
be or has been brought. The affidavit shall also contain
a statement of the facts claimed to justify the belief in
the existence of one or more of the above particulars. 
SEC. 149. The order of arrest shall not be issued by the
clerk, until there has been executed, by one or more 
sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, a written undertaking to
the effect that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant all
damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, if
the order be wrongfully obtained, not exceeding double
the amount of the plaintiff's claim stated in the affidavit. 
SEc. 150. The order may be made to accompany the
summons, or at any time afterward, before the judgment. 
SEC. 151. The order of arrest shall be addressed and
delivered, with a copy of the affidavit, to the sheriff; the
order shall state the name of the parties, the court in
which the action is brought, and the amount of the plain-
tiff's claim specified in the affidavit, and shalf require the
sheriff to an-est the defendant, and hold him to bail in
double the sum stated in the affidavit, and to make return
of the order on a day to be named therein, with the un-
dertaking of the bail, if any be given. 
SEc. 152. The return day of the order of arrest, when
issued at the commencement of the snit, shall be the same 
as that of the summons ; when issued afterward, it shall 
be fifteen days after it is issued. 
SEC. 153. The sheriff shall execute the order by arrest-
ing the defendant, and delivering to him a copy of the
order, and of the affidavit. If' the defendant cannot be
found before the return day, the plaintiff shall be entitled to
further orders, without another affidavit or undertaking
until the defendant is arrested ; but orders of arrest shall
not be issued to any other than the county in which the
action is brought. 
SEc. 154. The defendant, when arrested, shall be com-
mittcd by the sheriff to the jail of the county, and kept 
in custody until discharged by law. 
SEc. 155. The defendant may, before or after giving
bail, deposit in the hands of the sheriff, or in court, the 
amount of money mentioned in the order of arrest;
whereupon he shall be discharged, or his bail, if any be 
given, shall be released. 
SEc. 156. The sheriff shall pay into court the money
received by him in lieu of bail. If received in vacation,
he shall pay it in on the first day of the next term ; if
received during a term, he shall pay it in immediately. 
SEc. 157. The court shall make proper orders for the
safe-keeping of money deposited in lieu of bail. It may
directthe sheriff to keep the money, and, after final judg­
ment in the action, shall order it to be paid to the party
entitled thereto, according to the result. 
SEC. 158. Money so deposited with the sheriff, in lieu
of bail, or directed by the court to be kept by him, shall 
be held upon his official responsibility; and he and his
sureties shall be liable, and may be proceeded against ~r 
any default in relation thereto, as in other cases of delin-
quency. 
SEC. 159. Bail may be given by the defendant on his
arrest, or at any time afterward, before judgment, It
shall be done by causing one or more sufficient sureties
to execute a written undertaking to the plaintiff, in the 
presence of the sheriff, to the effect that, if judgment shall
be rendered in the action against the defendant, he will
render himself amenable to the process of the court
thereon. The undertaking, when accepted, shall be re­
turned to the clerk's office, and the defendant discharged . 
SEC. 160. The plaintiff or his attorney may accept the
bail by indorsing such acceptance on the undertaking; 
or may object to the bail, for insufficiency, at any time
within five days after the undertaking has been given.
Within such time, he shall serve upon the sheriff a written
notice that he does not accept the bail, or he shall be
deemed to have accepted it, and the sheriff shall be exon­
erated from liability. ,vhen the undertaking is given
after return of arrest, the plaintiff shall have notice thereof. 
SEC. 161. On the receipt of such notice, the sheriff or
defendant may, within two days thereafter, give, to the
plaintiff or his attorney, notice, in writing, of the justifi­
cation of the same or other bail, before a judge or clerk
of the court in which the action is brought, a probate
judge or justice of the peace, at a specified time and 
place ; the time to be not :Jt.ss than five nor more than ten
days thereafter. In case other Bail be given, tpere. must 
be a new undertaking. 
SEC. 162. For the purpose of justification, each of the
bail must attend before the proper office'r, at the time and 
place mentioned, and may be examined on oath or affirm-
ation touching his sufficiency, in such manner as the officer 
may think proper. ·
SEC. 163. If the officer find the bail sufficient, he shall 
indorse his allowance on the undertaking, and cause the
same to be filed with the clerk, and the sheriff shall 
thereupon be discharged from liability. 
SEC. 164. After being arrested, if the defendant escapes
or be rescued, or bail be not taken, or be adjudged insuffi­
cient, or a deposit be not made, the sheriff shall be liable
as bail. But he may discharge himself from liability by
putting in sufficient bail at any time before judgment. 
SEC. 165. The return of "Not found," upon an execution
against the body of the defendant shall be necessary to fix
the liability of the sheriff as bail, which liability shall be
the amount of the judgment, interest and costs. This
liability shall be enforced only in a separate action against
him, or against him and his sureties on his official bond,
as in other cases of delinquency. 
SEC. 168. The bail adjudged insufficient, shall be liable 
to the sheriff for the damages he may sustain by reason
of such insufficiency.  
SEC. 167. The liability of the bail shall be fixed in the
manner provided in section one hundred and sixty-five,
for fixing the liability of the sheriff as bail, and the bail
can be proceeded against in an action only. 
SEc. 168. A surrender of the defendant to the sheriff
of the county in which he was arrested, with a delivery of
a certified copy of the undertaking of the bail, whether 
such surrender be made by the defendant himself, or by
his bail, shall discharge the bail. Such surrender may be
made at any time before the return day of the summons
in an action against the bail. The sheriff shall give to the
bail a written adknowledgment of the surrender, and hold
the defendant in his custody, upon said copy of the under-
taking of the bail, as upon an order of arrest. On the
production of the sheriff' e aoknowledgment pf the sur-
render, to the clerk of the court, an exoneration of the
bail shall be entered on his undertaking. 
SEC. 169. For the pisrpose of surrendering the defend-
ant, the \an, at any time or place, before he is finally
charged, may himself arrest him, or by a written authori­ 
ty, indorsed on ~ certified copy of the undertaking, may
empower any person of suitable age and discretion to do 
SEc. 170. The bail will be exonerated by the death of
the defendant, or his imprisonment in a state-prison, or 
by his legal discharge from the obligation to surrender
himself amenable to the process of the court, or by his
surrender to the sheriff of the county in which he was
arrested in execution thereof, within the time fixed in section one hundred and sixty-eight, or within such further
time as the court, in which the action is pending, may
allow. 
SEC. 171. If money be deposited by the defendant on
his discharge, bail may be given and justified, upon notice 
as prescribed in section one hundred and sixty-one, at any 
time before judgment; and thereupon the court in which
the action is brought, on being satisfied that the bail has 
been given and adjudged sufficient, shall direct that the 
money deposited be refunded to the defendant, and it
must be refunded accordingly.
SEC. 172. If, at any time before or after judgment
against the bail, proceedings in error are commenced, on 
the judglnent against the principal, in the suit in which
their undertaking was taken, the court may, on motion,
stay proceedings against such bail, for a reasonable time,
on their paying all the costs that have accrued again~t
them; and if, on such proceedings, the judgment against 
the principal shall be reversed, and the principal dis­ 
charged from said suit, the bail shall be discharged from
the undertaking. · 
SEC. 173. A defendant arrested may, at any time beforP
the acceptance of the bail by the plaintiff, or the justifica- 
tion of the bail, apply on motion, to the court in which the
snit is brought, if in session, and, in vacation, to a judge 
thereof to vacate the order of arrest or to reduce the 
amount of the bail. Reasonable notice of such mo ion
must be given to the plaintiff.  
SEc. 174. If the motion be made upon affidavits on the 
part Of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff mar 
oppose the same, by affidavits or other evidt>11Ce, in addi­
tion to that on which the order of arrest was mu.de.

tp jail, under the provisions of this article, shall be liable,
in the first instance, for the jail fees, and shall, if required
by the jailor, pay such fees weekly, in advanee ; and

cause shown, appoint a receiver, who shall take an oath 
faithfully to discharge his duty, and shall give an under­
taking to the state of Kansas, in such sum as the court or
judge may direct, and with such security as shall be ap­
proved by the clerk of such court, for the faithful perform­
ance of his duty as such receiver, and to pay over all
money and account for all property which may come into
his hands by virtue of his appointment, at such times and
in such manner as the court may direct. 
SEC. 208. Such receiver shall take possession of all
notes, due bills, books of account, accounts and all other
evidences of debt that have been taken, by the sheriff or 
other officer, as the property of the defendant in attach­
ment, and shall proceed to settle and collect the same.
For that purpose, he may commence and maintain actions 
in his own name as such receiver; but in such actions, no
right of defense shall be impaired or affected. 
SEC. 209. Such receiver shall forthwith give notice of
his appointment to the persons indebted to the defendant
in attachment. The notice shall be written or printed,
and shall be served on the debtor or 'de btors, by copy
personally, or by copy left at the residence of the debtor
or de htors ; and from the date of such service, the debt-Ors
shall stand liable to the plaintiff in attachment for the
amount of moneys or credits in their hands, or due from
them to the defendant in attachment, and shall account
therefor to the receiver. 
SEc. 210. Such receiver shall, when required, report his
proceedings to the court, and hold all moneys collected
by him, and the property which may come into his hands,
subject to the order of the court. 
SEc. 211. Where a receiver is not appointed by the
court or a judge thereof, as provided in section two hun­ 
dred and seven, the sheriff or other officer attaching the
property, shall have all the powers and perform all the
duties of a receiver appointed by the court or a judge,
and may, if necessary, commence and maintain actions in
his own name as such officer. Ile may be required to give
security other than his official undertaking. 
SEC. 212. The court shall make proper orders for the
preservation of the property during the pendency of the
suit ; it may direct a sale of property, when, because of
its perishable nature, or of the costs of keeping it, a sale 
will be for the benefit of the parties. In vacation, such
sale may be ordered by the judge of the court. The sale 
shall be public, after such advertisement as is prescribed
for the sale of like property on execution, and shall be
made in such manner and upon such terms of credit, with
security, as the court or judge, having regard to the prob­
able duration of the action, may direct. The proceeds, if 
collected by the sheriff, with all the money received by
him from garnishees, shall be lreld and paid over hy him,
under the same requirement and responsibility of himself
and sureties, as are provided in respect to money deposited
in lien of bail. 
SEC. 213. If the defendant, or other person on his behalf,
at any time before judgment, cause an undertaking to be 
executed to the plaintiff, by one or more sureties, resident
in the county, to be approved by the court, in double the
amount of the plaintiff's claim, as stated in his affidavit, 
to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment
of the court, the attachment in such action shall be dis-
charged, and restitution made of any property taken
under it or the proceeds thereof. Such undertaking shall,
also, discharge the liability of a garnishee in such action,
for any property of the defendant in his hands. 
SEC. 214. The undertaking mentioned in the last section 
may.zin vacation, be executed in the presence of the
sheriff having the order of attachment in his hands, or
after the return of the order, before the clerk, with the
same effect as if executed in court, the sureties .in either
case to be approved by the officer before whom the under­
taking is executed. 
SEC. 215. The garnishee shall answer as follows : If the
order of attachment be returned during a term of the 
court, and ten days before the close thereof', he shall answer
at that term, on a day to be named in the notice, not less 
than ten days from the date of service. If the order be
returned during vacation, he shall answer on the first day
of the next term after its return. If the garnishee reside 
out of the county in which the action is brought, he shall
file written answers to the interrogatories served upon him 
within the time hereinbefore provided, which answers
shall be sworn to, subscribed and certified in the same
manner as an affidavit. If he reside in the county in
which the action is brought, he shall appear in court and 
be examined. .A garnishee shall answer, under oath, all 
questions or interrogatories put to him touching the prop­
erty, of every description, of the defendant, in his posses­
sion or under his control, and shall disclose truly the
amount owing by him to the defendant, at or after the
service of notice, whether due or not; and in case of a cor­ 
poration, any stock therein held by or for the benefit of
the defendant, at or after. the service of notice. 
SEC. 216. A garnishee may pay the money owing to the
defendant by him to the sheriff having the order of at­
tachment, or into court. He shall be discharged from 
liability to the defendant for any money so paid, not
exceeding the plaintiff's claim. He shall not be subject 
to costs, beyond those caused by his resistance of the
claim against him ; and if he disclose the property in his 
hands, or the true amount owing by him, and deliver and
pay the same, according to the order of the court, he shall
be allowed his costs. 
SEC. 217. If the garnishee do not answer, as required by section two hundred and fifteen, the court may proceed
against him by attachment, as for a contempt. 
SEC. 218. If the garnishee answer, and it is discovered,
on his examination, that, a.t or after the service of the order 
of attachment and notice upon him, he was possessed of
any property of the defendant, or was indebted to him, the
court may order the delivery of such property and the
payment of the amount owing by the garnishee, lnto the
court; or the court may permit the garnishee to retain the
property or the amount owing, upon the execution of an
undertaking to the plaintiff, by one or more sufficient
sureties, t-0 the effect that the amount shall be paid or the
property forthcoming, as the court may direct. 
SEc. 219. If the garnishee fail to answer, or if he answer
and his disclosure is not satisfactory to the plaintiff, or if 
he fail to comply with the order of the court to deliver
the property and pay the money owing into court, or give
the undertaking reg uired in the preceding section, the
plaintiff may proceed against him in an action, by filing a
petition, in his own name, as in other cases, and-eausing
a summons to be issued upon it ; and thereupon such 
proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment
may be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, for the amount
of property, and credits of every kind, of the defendant, in
the possession of the garnishee, and for what shall appear
to be owing by him to the defendant, and for the costs of 
the proceedings against the garnishee. If the plaintiff
proceed against the garnishee by action, for the cause that
his disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appear in the
action that such disclosure was incomplete, the plaintiff 
shall pay the costs of such action. The judgment in this
action may be enforced as judgments in other cases. 
When the claims of plaintiffs in attachment are satisfied,
the defendant in attachment may, on motion, be substitu­ 
ted as the plaintiff in this judgment.
SEC. 220. Final judgment shall not be rendered against 
the garnishee until the action against the defendant in
attachment has been determined; and if, in such action, 
judgment be rendered for the defendant in attachment, the
garnishee shall be discharged and recover costs. If the 
plaintiff shall recover against the defendant in attachment,
and the garnishee shall deliver up all the property,
moneys and credits of the defendant in his possession,
and pay all the moneys from him due, as the court may 
order, the garnishee shall be discharged, and the costs of
the proceedings against him shall be paid out of the prop­ 
erty and moneys so surrendered, or as the court may think
right and proper; and on final judgment against the
garnishee, execution may be issued as in other cases. 
SEC. 221. If judgment be rendered in the action for the
defendant, the attachment shall be discharged, and the
property attached, or its proceeds, shall be returned to
him. 
SEc. 222. If judgment be .rendered for the plaintiff, it
shall be satisfied as follows: So much of the property
remaining in the hands of the officer, after applying the
moneys arising from the sale of perishable property, and
so much of the personal property and lands and tenements,
if any, whether held by legal or equitable title, as may be
necessary to satisfy the judgment, shall be sold by order
of the court, under the same restrictions and regulations
as if the same had been levied on by execution; and the
money arising therefrom, with the amount which may be 
recovered from the garnishee, shall be applied to satisfy
the judgment and costs. If there be not enough to satisfy
the same, the judgment shall stand, and execution may
issue thereon for the residue, in all respects as in other
cases. Any surplus of the attached property or its pro­
ceeds shall be returned to the defendant. 
SEC. 223. The court may compel the delivery to tht: 
sheriff, for sale, of any of the attached property for which
an undertaking may have been given, and may proceed
summarily, on such undertaking, to enforce the delivery of
the property, or the payment of such sum as may be due
upon the undertaking, by rules and attachments, as in
cases of contempt. 
SEc. 224. The court may order the sheriff to repossess
himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached 
property, which may have passed out of his hands,
without having been sold or converted into money ; and
the sheriff shall, under such order, have the same power 
to take the property as he would have under an order of
attachment. 
SEC. 225. Where several attachments are executed upon
the same property, or the same persons are made gar­
nishees, the court, on motion of any of the plaintiffs, may
order a reference, to ascertain and report the amounts and
priorities of the several attachments, or may determine
any such amount and priorities without such reference. 
SEc. 226. From the time of the issuing of the order of 
attachment, the court shall be deemed to have acquired
jurisdiction and to have control of all subsequent pro­ 
ceedings under the attachment; and if, after the issuing
of the order, the defendant, being a person, should die, or a
corporation, and its charter should expire by limitation,
forfeiture or otherwise, the proceedings shall be carried 
on; but in all such cases, other than where the defendant
was a foreign corporation, his legal representatives shall
be made parties to the action. 
SEC. 227. The defendant may, at any time before judg­
ment, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move the
court for additional security on the part of the plaintiff;
and if, on such motion, the court is satisfied that the
surety in the plaintiff's undertaking has removed from
this state, or is not sufficient for the amount thereof, it
may vacate the order of attachment and direct restitution
of any property taken under it, unless, in a reasonable
time, to be fixed by the court, sufficient security be given 
by the plaintiff. 
SEC. 228. The defendant may, at any time before judg­
ment, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move to dis- 
charge an attachment, as to the whole or a part of the
property attached. 
SEC. 229. If the motion be made upon affidavits, on the
part of the defendant, or papers and evidence in the case, 
but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the same by 
a.flidavits or other evidence, in addition to that on which
the order of attachment was made. 
SEC. 230. Where a debtor has sold, conveyed or other- 
wise disposed of his property, with the fraudulent intent 
to cheat or defraud his creditors, or to hinder or delay
them in the collection of their debts, or is about to make
such sale or conveyance or disposition of his property,
with such fraudulent intent, or is about to remove his
property, or a material part thereof, with the intent or to
the effect of cheating or defrauding his creditors, or of
hindering or delaying them in the collection of their debts,
a creditor may bring an action on his claim before it is
due, and have an attachment against the property of the 
debtor.
SEC. 231. The attachment authorized by the last section
may be granted by the court in which the action is brought,
or by a judge thereof; but before such an action shall be 
brought, or such attachment shall be granted, the plaintiff,
or his agent or attorney, shall make an oath, in writing,
showing the nature ancl amount of the plaintiff's claim,
that it is just, when the same will become due, and the
existence of some one of the grounds for an attachment
enumerated in the preceding section. 
SEC. 232. If the court or judge refuse to grant an order
of attachment, the action s a e ismisse , ut without
prejudice to a. future action; and in all such actions, ap-
plication for an attachment must be made. 
SEC. 233. The order of the court or judge granting the
attachment shall specify the amount for which it is al-
lowed, not exceeding a sum sufficient to satisfy the plain­
tiff's claim, and the probable costs of the action. 
SEC. 284. The order of attachment, as granted by the
court or judge, shall not be issued by the clerk until there 
has been executed, in his office, an undertaking, on the
part of the plaintiff, as in case of any ordinary attachment. 
SEc. 235. The plaintiff in such action shall not have
judgment on his claim before it is due, but the proceed- 
ings on the attachment may be conducted without delay. 
SEC. 236. The proceedings applicable to attachments
issued by the clerk in ordinary cases, shall regulate the 
attachment granted by the court or judge, as far as ap­
plicable.

SEC. 238. When it appears, by the petition, that the
plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such re­
lief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the com­
mission or continuance of some act, the commission or 
continuance of which, during the litigation, would produce
injury to the plaintiff; or when, during the litigation, it
appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is
about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some

ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be granted to re­
strain such act. And when, during the pendency of an

ment ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be granted

the affidavit of the plaintiff or his agent, that the plaintiff,
is entitled thereto. 
SEC. 240. If the court or judge deem it proper that the
defendant, or any party to the suit, should be heard before

party injured the damages he may sustain, if it be finally 
decided that the injunction ought not to have been granted.

the party enjoined, shall state the injunction, and shall be
issued by the clerk. Where the injunction is allowed at

application for an injunction, shall be notice of its al-
lowance.

cant, by a court of inferior jurisdiction, or any judge

being satisfied, by affidavit, of the breach of the injunc­
tion, against the party guilty of the same, and he may be

SEC. 269. the general mode of summoning the jury is
such as is or may be provided by law. 
SEC. 270. If there shall be impanneled, for the trial of
any cause, any pctit juror, who shall have been convicted 
of any crime which by law renders him disqualified to
serve on a jury; or who has been arbitrator on either side, 
relating to the same controversy ; or who has an interest
in the cause; or who has an action pending between him
and either party; or who has formerly been a juror in the
same cause; or who is the employer, employee, counselor,
agent, steward or attorney of either party; or who is sub­
penaed as a witness ~ or who is of kin to either party ; or
any person who shall have S<'ITPd once already on a jury,
as a talesman on the trial of any cause, in the same com t
during the term, he may be ohallenged for such causes ; in
either of which cases the same shall he cousidered as a
prlneipnl challenge, and the validity thereof be tried by 
the court; and any petit juror who shall be returned upon
the trial of any of the causes herein before specified, against
whom no principal cause of challenge can be alleged, may,
nevertheless, be challenged on suspicion of prejudice
against, or partiality for, either party, or for want of com­
petent knowledge of the English language, or any other
cause that may render him, at the time, an unsuitable 
juror ; and the validity of such challenge shall be deter­
mined by the court. 
SEC. 271. The plaintiff first, and afterward the defendant, s a complete his challenges for cause. They may 
then, in tum, in the same order, have the right to challenge
one juror -each, until each shall have peremptorily chal- 
lenged three jurors, but no more. 
SEC. 272. After each challenge, the vacancy shall be
filled before further challenges are made ; and any new 
juror thus introduced may be challenged for cause as well
as peremptorily. 
SEC. 273. When the requisite number of jurors cannot
otherwise be obtained, the sheriff shall select talesmen to
supply the deficiency from the bystanders, or the body of
the county, as the court may direct. 
SEC. 274. The jury shall be sworn to well and truly try
the matters submitted to them in the case in hearing, and 
a true verdict give, according to the law and the evidence. 
SEC. 275. When the jury has been sworn, the trial shall
proceed in the following order, unless the court, for special 
reasons, otherwise directs: First, The party on whom
rests the burthcn of the ·it:sues may briefly state his case, 
1 and the evidence by which he expects to sustain it. Sec-
ond, The adverse party may then briefly state his defense, 
and the evidence he expects to offer in support of it.
?Third, The party on whom rests the burthen of the issues 
must first produce his evidence; the adverse party will
then produce his evidence. Fourth, The parties will then
be confined to rebutting evidence, unless the court, for
good reasons, in furtherance of justice, permits them to
off er evidence in their original case. Fifth; When the
evidence is concluded, and either party desires special in­
structions to be given to the jury, such instructions shall
be reduced to writing, numbered and signed by the party, 
or his attorney, asking the same, and delivered to the 
court. Sixth., When the argument of .the cause is conclu­
ded, the court shall give general instructions to the jury, 
which shall be in writing, and be numbered and signed
by the judge, if required by either party. Seventh,
Where either patty asks special instructions to be given
to the jury, the court shall either give each instruction, as
requested, or positively refuse to do so; or give the in­
structions with a modification, in such manner that it shall
distinctly appear what instructions were given, in whole
or in part, and, in like manner, those refused, so that either
party may except to the instructions, as asked for, or as
modified, or to the modification. All instructions given
by the court must be signed by the judge, and filed, to­ 
gether with those asked for by the parties, as a part of the
record. 
SEc. 276. A party excepting to the giving of instruc- 
tions, or the refusal thereof, shall not be required to file a
formal bill of exceptions ; but it shall be sufficient to write 
at the close of each instruction, '' Refused and excepted 
to," or, "Given and excepted to," which shall be signed
by the judge. 
SEC. 277. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is
proper for the jury to have a view of the property which
is the subject of litigation, or of the place in which any
material fact occurred, it may order them to be conducted,
in a body, under the charge of an officer, to the place,
which shall be shown to them by some person appointed
by the court for that purpose . While the jury are thus
absent, no person, other than the person so appointed,
shall speak to them on any subject connected with the
trial. 
SEC. 278. When the case is finally submitted to the jury,
they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If 
h h b k h .
ey retire, t ey must e ept toget er, m some conve- 
nient place, under charge of an officer, until they agree
upon a verdict or be discharged by the court, subject to
the discretion of the court to permit them to separate tem­
porarily at night, and at their meals. The officer having
them under his charge shall not suffer any communication 
to be made to them, or make any himself, except to ask
them if they are agreed upon their verdict, unless by order
of the court; and he shall not, before their verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of their
deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon. 
SEC. 279. If the jury are permitted to separate, either
during the trial or after the case is submitted to them, 
they shall be admonished by the court that it is their duty
not to converse with, or suffer themselves to be addressed
by, any other person; on any subject of the trial, and that
it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon,
until the case is finally submitted to them. 
SEc. 280. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if
there be a disagreement between them as to any part of
the testimony, or if they desire to be informed as to any 
part of the law arising in the case, they may request the
officer to conduct them to the court, where the information
on the point of law shall be given in writing, and the court
may give its recollection as to the testimony on the point
in dispute, in the presence of, or after notice to, the parties
or their counsel. 
SEC. 281. The jury may be discharged by the court on
account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or
calamity requiring their discharge, or by consent of both 
parties, or after they have been kept together until it
satisfactorily appears that there is no probability of their
agreeing. 
SEc. 282. In all cases where the jury are discharged
during the trial, or after the eause is submitted to them, 
it may be tried again immediately, or at a future time, as
the court may direct. 
SEC. 283. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict,
they must be conducted into court, their names called by
the clerk, and the verdict rendered by their foreman.
When the verdict is announced, either party may require
the jury to be polled, which is done by the clerk or the
court asking each juror if it is his verdict. If any one
answers in the negative, the jury must again be sent out,
for further deliberation. 
SEC. 284. The verdict shall be written, 'signed by the
foreman and read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry 
made whether it is their verdict. If any juror disagrees,
the jury must be sent out again; but if no disagreement 
be expressed, and neither party requires the jury to be
polled, the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged
from the case. If, however, the verdict be defective in
form only, the same may, with the assent of the jury,
before they are discharged, be corrected by the court. 
SEC. 285. The verdict of a jury is either general or 
special. A general verdict is that by which they pro­
nounce generally upon all or any of the issues, either in
favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is
that by which the jury finds facts only. It must present 
the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evi­
dence to prove them ; and they m ust be so presented as
that nothing :remains to the court but to draw from them
conclusions of law. 
SEC. 286. In every action for the recovery of money
only, or specific real property, the jury, in their discretion,
may render a general or special verdict. In all other cases
the court may direct the jury to find a special verdict, in 
writing, upon all or any of the issues; and in all cases/:
may instruct them, if they render a general verdict, to 
find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in
writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The
special verdict or finding must be filed with the clerk, and 
entered on the J0 ournal, · 
SEC. 287. When the special finding of facts is inconsist-
ent with the -general verdict, the former controls the latter, 
and the court may give judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 288. When, by the verdict, either party is entitled
to recover monPy of the adverse party, the jury, in tln-ir
verdict, must assess the amount of recovery. 
SEC. 280. The trial by jury may be waived by the
parties, in actions arising on contract, and with the assent 
of the court in other actions, in the following manner :
By the consent of the party appearing, when the other
party fails to appear at the trial by himself or attorm-v.
By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with 
the clerk. By oral consent, in open court, entered on the
journal. 
SEC. 290. Upon the trial of questions of fact by the
court, it shall not be necessary for the court to state its
finding, except g<>rn:rally, for the plaintiff or defendant,
unless one of the parties request it, with the view of ex­
cepting to the decision of the court upon the q u-stions of
law invoked in the trial; in which case the court shall
state, in writing, the conclusions of fact found, separately 
from the conclusions of In w. 
SEC. 291. All or any of the issues in the action, whether 
of fact or of law, or both, may be referred, upon the
written consent of the parties, or upon their oral consent
in court, entered upon the journal. 
SEC. 292. When the parties do not consent, the court
may, upon the application or either, or of its own motion, 
direct a reference in either of the following cases: Where
the trial of an issue of fact shall require the examination 
of mutual accounts, or when the account is on one side
only, and it shall be made to appear to tho court that it is
necessary that the party on the other side should be exam-
ined as a witness to prove the account ; in which case the
referees may be directed to hear and report upon the 
whole issue, or upon any specific question of fact involved
therein; or where the taking of an account shall be neces- 
sary for the information of the court before judgment, in
cases which rqay be determined by the court, or for carry- 
ing a judgment into effect; or where a question of fact
other than upon the pleadings, shall arise, upon motion
or otherwise, in any stage of an action. 
SEC. 293. A trial before referees is conducted in the
same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same 
power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses,
to administer all necessary oaths in the trial of the case, 
and to grant adjournments, as the court, upon such trial.
Theymuststatethefacts found and the conclusions of law
separately, and their decisions must be given, and may be
excepted to and reviewed in like manner. The report of
the referees upon the whole issue stands as the decision of
the court, and. judgment may be entered thereon in the
same manner as if the action had-been tried by the court.
When the referee is to report the facts, the report has the
effect of a special verdict. 
SEc. 294. In all cases of reference, the parties, except
when an infant may be a party, may agree upon a suita-
ble person or persons, not exceeding three, and the refer-
ence shall be ordered accordingly ; and if the parties do
not agree, the court shall appoint one or more referees, not
exceeding three, who shall be free from exception. 
SEC. 295. It shall be the duty of the referees to sign any
true exceptions taken to any order or decision by them 
made in the case, and return the same, with their report,
to the court making the reference. 
SEC. 296. A. judge, in vacation, upon the written consent
of the parties, may make any order of reference which 
the court of which he is a member could make in term
time. In such case, the order of reference shall be made
on the written agreement of the parties to refer, and shall
be filed with the clerk of the court, with the other papers 
in the case. 
SEc. 297. The referees must be sworn or affirmed well
and faithfully to hear and examine the cause, and to make 
a just and true report therein, according to the best of
their understanding. The oath may be administered by
any person authorized to take depositions. 
SEC. 208. The referees shall be allowed such compensa­
tion for their services as the court may deem just and
proper, which shall be taxed as part of the costs in the 
case.
SEC. 299. An exception rs an objection taken to a deci-
sion of the court or judge upon a matter of law. 
SEC. 300. The party objecting to the decision must ex-
cept at the time the decision is made, and time may be
given to reduce the exception to writing, but not beyond
the term. If the decision objected to is made in vacation
or at chambers, the judge may give time to reduce the 
exception to writing, not exceeding ten days. 
SEC. 301. No particular form of exception is required.
The exception must be stated, with so much of the evidence
as is necessary to explain it, and no more, and the whole
as briefly as possible. 
SEc. 802. Where the decision objected to is entered on
the record, and the grounds of objection appear in the 
entry, the. exception may be taken by the party causing 
to be noted. at the end of the decision, that he excepts.
SEc. 808. Where the decision is not entered on the 
record, or the grounds of objection do not sufficiently
appear in the entry, the party excepting must reduce his 
exceptions to writing, and present it to the judge for his
allowance. If true, it shall be the duty of the judge to 
allow and sign it; whereupon it shall be filed with the
pleadings as a part of the record, but not spread at large
on the joumal. If the writing is not true, the Judge shall 
correct it, or suggest the correction to be made, and it
shall then be signed as aforesaid . 
SEc. 304. No exception shall be regarded, unless it is
material. and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the 
party excepting. f;", it, 
SEC. 305. Exceptions taken to the decision of any court
of record may, by leave of such court, be withdrawn from
the files by the party taking the same, at any time before
proceedings in error are commenced. 
SEC. 306. New trial is a re-examinatloii, m t e same 
·l~;- court, of an issue of fact, after a verdict by a. jury, report
of a referee, or a decision by the court. The former ver- 
diet, report or decision shall be vacated, and a new trial
granted, on the application of the party aggrieved, for 
any of the following causes, affecting materially the sub-
stantial rights of such party: First, Irregularity in the 
proceedings of the court, jury, referee, or prevailing party,
or any order of the court or referee, or abuse of discretion, 
by which the party was prevented from having a fair trial.
Second, Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party . .: 
Third, .Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence.:
could not have guarded against. Fourth, Excessive dam- 
ages, appearing to have been given under the influence of
passion or prejudice. Fiftli, Error in the assessment of 
the amount of recovery, whether too large or too small,
where the action is upon a contract, or for the injury or 
det.ention of property. Sixth, That the verdict, report or
decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence, or is con-
trary to law. Seventh, Newly discovered evidence, mate-v: 
rial for the party applying, which he could not, with
reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
trial. Eighth, Error of law occurring at the trial, and
except.ed to by the party making the appli£,tion. 
SEC. 307. A new trial shall not be granted;n account of
the smallness of the damages, in an action for an injury 
to the person or reputation, nor in any other action where
the damages shall equal the actual pecuniary injury
sustained. 
SEC. 308. The application for a riew trial must be made
at the t.erm the verdict, report or decision is rendered; and, 
except for the cause of newly discovered evidence, material
for the party applying, which he could not, with reason- 
able diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial,
shall be within three days after the verdict or decision was
rendered, unless unavoidably prevented. 
SEC, 309. The application must be by motion, upon
written grounds, filed at the time of making the motion.
The causes enumerated in subdivisions two, three and
seven, of section three hundred and six, must be sustained
by affidavits, showing their truth, and may be controverted
by affidavits. 
SEC. 310. Where the grounds for a new' trial could not,
with reasonable diligence, have been discovered before, 
but are discovered after the term at which the verdict,
report of referee or decision was rendered or made, the
application may be made by petition, filed as in other
cases, not later than the second term after discovery ; on
which a summons shall issue, be returnable and served,
or publication made, as prescrlbejt in section seventy-four.
The facts stated in the petition sha1' be considered as denied
without answer, and if the service shall be complete in
vacation, the case shall be 'heard and summarily decided
at the ensuing term, and if in term, it shall be heard and
decided after the expiration of twenty days. from such
service. The case shall be placed on the trial docket, and
the witnesses shall be examined in open court, or their
depositions taken as in other cases; but no such petition
shall be filed more than one year after the final judgment 
was rendered. 
SEc. 311. Whenever damages are recoverable, the plain­
tiff may claim and recover any rate of damages to which
he may be entitled for the cause of action established. 
SEC. 312. The provisions of this article respecting trials
by jury apply, so ar as they are in their nature applicable, 
to trials by the court. 
SEC. 313. A trial docket shall be made out by the clerk-J<
of the court, at least twelve days before the first day of',
each term of the court ; and the actions shall be set for par- ..;,, 
ticular days, in the order in which they are brought, and
so arranged that the cases set for each day shall be tried 
as nearly as may be on that day . 
SEc. 314. The trial of an issue of fact, and the assess-
ment of damages in any case, shall be in the order in 
which they are placed on the trial docket, unless by con- 
sent of the parties or the order of the court, they are con­
tinued or placed at the heel of the docket. The time of 
hearing all other cases shall be in the order in which they
are placed on the docket, unless the court, in its discretion, 
shall otherwise direct. The court may, in its discretion,
hear at any time a motion, and may, .by rule, prescribe
the time for hearing motions. 
SEc. 815. Actions shall be triable at the first term of the
court, after the issues therein by the times fixed for plead- 
~g are or should hav? been m~de up; and when, by the
times fixed for pleading, the issues are or should have 
been made up during a term, such action shall be triable
at that term. When the issues are or should have been 
made up, either before or during a term of court, but after
the period for preparing the trial docket of such term, the
clerk shall place such actions on the trial docket of that
term. 
SEC. 316. The court may, for good cause shown, continue
an action at any stage of the proceedings, upon such 
terms as may be just. When a continuance is granted on
account of the absence of evidence, it shall be at the cost
of the party making the application, unless the court 
otherwise order. · 
SEC. 317. A motion for a continuance, on account of the 
absence of evidence, can be made only upon affidavit,
showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be 
obtained, and that due diligence has been used to obtain
it, and where the evidence may be; and if it is for an 
absent witness, the affidavit must show where the witness
resides, if his residence is known to the party, and the
probability of procuring his testimony within a reasonable 
time, and what facts he believes the witness will prove,
and that he believes them to be true. If, thereupon, the 
_....,adverse party will consent that on the trial the facts alleged
in the affidavit shall be read and treated as the deposition
of the absent witness, or that the facts in relation to other
evidence shall be taken as proved to the extent alleged in 
the affidavit, no continuance shall be granted on the
ground of the absence of such evidence. 
SEc. 318. The clerk shall make out a copy of the trial
docket for the use of the bar, before the first day of the 
term of court.

conviction may be shown for the purpose of affecting his 
credibility.
SEC. 820. Nothing in the preceding section contained
shall, in any manner, affect the laws now existing, relat- 
ing to the settlement of estates of deceased persons, infants,
idiots or lunatics, or the attestation of the execution of
last wills and testaments, or of conveyances of real estate,
or of any other instrument required by law to be attested. 
SEC. 821. Any party to a civil action or proceeding may

ness in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, as 
other witnesses.

defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render judg­
ment against one or more of them, leaving the action to
proceed against the others whenever a 'several judgment
may be proper. The court may also dismiss the petition
with costs, in favor of one or more defendants, in case of
unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiff to serve
the summons on other defendants, or proceed in the cause
against the defendant or defendants served.

where the trial is by the court. Second, By the court,
where the plaintiff fails to appear on the trial. Third, 
By the court, for the want of necessary parties. Fourth, 
By the court, on the application of some of the defendants,'
where there are others whom the plaintiff fails to prose- 
cute with diligence. Fifth, By the court, for disobedience
by the plaintiff of an order concerning the proceedings in
the action. Sixth, In all other cases, upon the trial of the
action, the decision must be upon the merits. 
SEc. 398. In any case where a set-off or counter-claim 
has been presented, the defendant shall have the right of
proceeding to the trial of his claim, although the plaintiff

SEC. 399. In actions to enforce a mortgage or other lien
or charge, a personal judgment shall be rendered for the
amount due, with interest, and for the sale of the proper-
ty charged, and the application of the proceeds; or such 
application may be reserved for the further order of the/j

conveyance, release or acquittance, in aay court of this 
state, and the party against whom the judgment shall be
rendered does not comply therewith by the time appointed, 
such judgment shall have the same operation and effect,
and be as available, as if the conveyance, release or ac- 
quittance had been executed conformably to such judg-
ment ; or the court may order such conveyance, -release or
acquittance to be executed in the first instance by the
sheriff; and such conveyance, release or acquittance, so
executed, shall have the same effect as if executed by the
party against whom the judgment was rendered. This section shall apply to decrees rendered or to be rendered
in suits now pending. 
SEc. 401. If the taking of an account, or the proof of a
fact, or the assessment of damages, be necessary to enable
the court to pronounce judgment upon a failure to answer,
or after a decision of an issue of law, the court may, with 
the assent of the party not in default, take the account,
hear the proof, or assess the damages; or may, with the
like assent, refer the same to a referee or master commis­
sioner, or may direct the same to be ascertained or assessed
by a jury. If a jury be ordered, it shall be on or after the
day on which the action is set for trial. 
SEC. 402. Any person indebted, or against whom a cause
of action exists, may personally appear in a court of com-

stated in the judgment, or in writing, to be filed as plead­
ings in other actions.

fession, an affidavit of the defendant must be filed, stating 
concisely the facts on which the indebtedness arose, and
that the amount of such indebtedness is justly due and
owing by the defendant to the plaintiff. 
SEc. 406. Such judgment shall authorize the same pro­
ceedings for its enforcement as judgments rendered in
actions regularly brought and prosecuted; and the confes­
sion shall operate as a release of errors. 
SEC. 407. Every attorney, who shall confess judgment
in any case, shall, at the time of making such confession, 
produce the warrant of attorney for making the same to
the court before which he makes the confession, and the
original, or a copy of the warrant, shall be filed with the
clerk of the court in which the judgment shall be entered. 
SEC. 408. If any person be in custody in a civil action,
at the suit of another, no warrant of attorney, executed
by the person in custody, to confess judgment in favor of
the person at whose suit he is in custody, shall be of any
force, unless some attorney, expressly named by the person 
in custody, be present and sign the warrant of attorney
as a witness. 
SEC. 409. When a trial by jury has been had, judgment
must be entered by the clerk in conformity to the verdict, 
unless it is special, or the court order the case to be re-
served for future argument or consideration. 
SEc. 410. Where the verdict is special, or where there
has been a special :finding on particular questions of fact, 
or where the court has ordered the case to be reserved, it
shall order what judgment shall be entered. 
SEC. 411. Where, upon the statement in the pleadings,
one party is entitled by law to judgment in his favor, 
judgment shall be so rendered by the court, though a.
verdict has been found against such party. 
SEC. 412. If a counter-claim or set-off, established at the
trial, exceed the plaintiff's claim so established, judgment
for the defendant must be given for the excess; or if it 
appear that the defendant is entitled to any affirmative
relief, judgment shall be given therefor. 
SEC. 413. It shall not be necessary to reserve, in a judg-
mentor order, the right of an infant to show cause against 
it a.ft.er his attaining full age; but in any case in which,

proper, the infant, within one year after arriving at the age
of twenty-one years, may show cause against such order 
or judgment. 
SEC. 414. All judgments and orders must be entered on
the journal of the court, and specify clearly the relief 
granted or order made in [the] action. 
SEC. 415. The clerk shall make a complete record of
every cause as soon as it finally determined, whenever 
such record shall be ordered by the court. 
SEC. 416. He shall make up such record, in each cause,
in the vacation next after the term at which the same was 
determined ; and the presiding judge of such court shall,
at its next term thereafter, subscribe the same. 
SEC. 417. The record shall be made up from the peti-
tion, the process, return, the pleadings subsequent thereto, 
reports, verdicts, orders, judgments, and all material acts
and proceedings of the court ; but if the items of an ac-
count, or the copies of papers attached to the pleadings,
be voluminous, the court may order the record to be made 
by abbreviating the same, or inserting a pertinent descrip­
tion thereof, or by omitting them entirely. Evidence must
not be recorded. 
SEC. 418. When the judicial acts Jr other proceedings
of any court have not been regularly brought up and re­
corded by the clerk thereof, such court shall cause the
same to be made up and recorded within such time as it

nation, found to be correct, the presiding judge of such
court shall subscribe the same. 
SEc. 419. Judgments of courts of record, of this state,
and of courts of the United States rendered within this 
state, shall be liens on the real estate of the debtor, within
the county in which the judgment is rendered, from the 
first day of the term at which the judgment is rendered;
but judgments by confession, and judgments rendered at
the same term during which the action was commenced,
shall bind such lands only from the day on which such
judgment was rendered. An attested copy of the journal
entry of any judgment, together with a statement of the
costs taxed against the debtor in the case, may be filed in
the office of the clerk of the district court of any county,
and such judgment shall be a lien on the real estate of the 
debtor, within that county, from the date of filing such
copy. The clerk shall ent.er such judgment on the appear­ 
ance and judgment dockets in the same manner as if ren­ 
dered in the court of which he is clerk. Executions shall
only be issued from the court in which the judgment is 
rendered. 
SEc. 420. In addition to the causes of action which snr- 
vive at common law, causes of action for mesne profits, or
for an injury to the person, or to real or personal estate,
or for any deceit or fraud, shall also survive ; and the action
may be brought, notwithstanding the death of the person 
entitled or liable to the same.
SEc. 421. No action pending in any court shall abate by 
the death of either or both the parties thereto, except an 
action for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, for a nui­
sance, or against a justice of the peace for misconduct in
office, which shall abate by the death of the defendant. 
SEC. 422. When the death of one is caused by the
wrongful act or omission of another, the personal repre­ 
sentatives of the former may maintain an action therefor
against the latter, if the former might have maintained an
action had he lived, against the latter for an injury for the
same act or omission. The action must be commenced 
within two years. The damages cannot exceed ten
thousand dollars, and must inure to the exclusive benefit
of the widow and children, if any, or next of kin, to be 
distributed in the same manner as personal property of
the deceased.

being stated on the record.\ . 
SEc. 424. Where one of several plaintiffs or defend­
ants dies, or his powers as a personal representative cease, 
if the cause of action do not admit of survivorship, and
the court is of opinion that the merits of the controversy
can be properly determined and the principles applicable
to the case fully settled, it may proceed to try the same
as between the remaining parties; but the judgment shall
not prejudice any who were not parties at the time of trial. 
SEC. 425. When one of the parties to an action dies, or
his powers as a personal representative cease before the 
judgment, if the right of action survive in favor of or
against his representatives or successors, the action may
be revived and proceed in their names. 
SEC. 426. The revivor shall be by an order of the court,
if made in term, or by a judge thereof, if in vacation,
that the action be revived in the names of the representa­
tives or successor of the party who died, or whose powers
ceased, and proceed in favor of or against them. 
SEC. 427. The order may be made on the motion of the
adverse party, or of the representatives or successor of
the party who died, or whose powers ceased, suggesting
his death or the cessation of his powers, which, with the
names and capacities of his representatives or successor,
shall be stated in the order. 
SEC. 428. If the order is made by consent of the parties,
the action shall forthwith stand revived ; and, if not made
by consent, notice of the application for such order shall 
be served in the same manner and returned within the
same time as a summons, upon the party adverse to the
one making the motion ; and if sufficient cause be not
shown against the revivor, the order shall be made. 
SEc. 429. When the plaintiff shall make an affidavit
that the representatives of the defendant, or any one of
them, in whose name it is desired to have the action
revived, are non-residents of the state, or have left the
same to avoid the service of the order [notice], or so con­
cealed themselves that the order [notice] cannot be served
upon them, or that the names and residence of the heirs 
or devisees of the person against whom ·the action may be 
ordered to be revived, or some of them, are unknown to 
the affiant, a notice may be published for three consecutive
weeks, notifying them to appear on a day therein named, 
not less than ten days after the publication is complete, and
show cause why the action should not be revived against
them; and, if sufficient cause be not shown to the contrary,
the order shall be made. 
SEC. 430. Upon the death of the plaintiff in an action,
it may be revived in the names of his representatives, to
whom his right has passed. Where his right has passed 
to his personal representatives, the revivor shall be in
their names ; where it has passed to his heirs or devisees, 
who could support the action if brought anew, the revivor
may be in their names. 
SEc. 431. Upon the death of a defendant in an action,
wherein the right, or any part thereof, survives against his
personal representatives, the revivor shall be against them; 
and it may, also, be against the heirs and devisees of the
defendant, or both, when the right of action, or any part
thereof, survives against them. 
SEC. 432. Upon the death of a defendant in an action
for the recovery of real property only, or which concerns
only his rights or claims to such property, the action may
be revived against his heirs or devisees, or both, and an
order therefor may be forthwith made, in the manner di-
rected in the preceding sections of this article. 
SEC. 433. An order to revive an action against the rep-
resentatives or successor of a defendant shall not be made 
without the consent of such representatives or successor,
unless in one year from the time it could have been first 
made. 
SEC. 434. An order to revive an action, in the names of
the representatives or successor of a plaintiff, may be 
made forthwith, but shall not be made without the consent
of the defendant, after the expiration of one year from the 
time the order might have been first made; but where the
defendant shall also have died, or his powers have ceased,
in the meantime, the order of revivor, on both sides, may
be made in the period limited in the last section. 
SEc. 435. When it appears to the court, by affidavit,
that either party to an action has died, or where a party 
sues or is sued as a personal representative, that his
powers have ceased for a period so long that the action 
cannot be revived in the names of his representatives or
successor, without the consent of both parties, it shall 
order the action to be stricken from the docket. 
SEC. 436. At any term of the court succeeding the death
of the plaintiff, while the action remains on the docket,
the defendant having given the plaintiff's proper repre­
sentatives, in whose name the action might be revived, ten
days' notice of the application therefor, may have an order 
to strike the action from the docket, and for costs against
the estate of the plaintiff, unless the action is forthwith 
revived. 
SEc. 437. When, by the provisions of the preceding sec-
tions, an action is revived, the trial thereof shall not be 
postponed by reason of the revivor, if the action would
have stood for trial at the term the revivor is complete,

and before satisfaction thereof, their representatives, real
or personal, or both, as the case may require, may be 
made parties to the same, in the same manner as is pre­
scribed for reviving actions before judgment ; and such
judgment may be rendered, and execution awarded, as
might or ought to be given or awarded against the repre­
sentatives, real or personal, or both, of such deceased 
party. 
SEc. 440. If a judgment become dormant, it may be re-.
vived in the same manner as is prescribed for reviving

the property of the judgment debtor. Second, Against
his person. Third, For the delivery of the possession of
real or personal property, with damages for withholding
the same, and costs. Fourth, Executions in special cases. 
SEc. 443. Lands, tenements, goods and chattels; not 
exempt by law, shall be subject to the payment of debts,
and shall be liable to be taken on execution and sold, as
hereinafter provided. 
SEc. 444. All real estate, not bound by the lien of the
judgment, as well as goods and chattels of the debtor,
shall be bound from the time they shall be seized in exe­
cution. 
SEC. 445. If execution shall not be sued out within five
years from the date of any judgment that now is or may
hereafter be rendered, in any court of record in this state,
or if five years shall have intervened between the date of
the last execution issued on such judgment and the time
of suing out another writ of execution thereon, such
judgment shall become dormant, and shall cease to operate
as a lien on the estate of the judgment debtor. 
SEc. 446. The writ of execution against the property of
the judgment debtor, issuing from any court of record in
this state, shall command the officer to whom it is di­ 
rected, that of the goods and chattels of the debtor he
cause to be made the money specified in the writ ; and for
want of goods and chattels, he cause the same to be made
of the lands and tenements of the debtor ; and the amount
of the debt, damages and costs, for which the judgment
is entered, shall be indorsed on the execution. 
SEc. 447. When two or more writs of execution against
the same debtor shall be sued out during the term in
which judgment was rendered, or within ten days there­
after, and when two or more writs of execution against
the same debtor shall be delivered to the officer on the
same day, no preference shall be given to either of such
writs ; but if a sufficient sum of money be not made to
satisfy all [such] executions, the amount made shall be
distributed to the several creditors in proportion to the
amount of their respective demands. In all other cases,
the writ of execution first delivered to the officer shall be
first satisfied. And it shall be the duty of the officer to 
indorse on every writ of execution the time when he re­ 
ceived the same; but nothing herein contained shall be 
so construed as to affect any preferable lien which one or
more of the judgments, on which execution issued, may
have on the lands of the judgment debtor. 
SEC. 448. The officer to whom a writ of execution is 
delivered, shall proceed immediately to levy the same
upon the goods and chattels of the debtor; but if no 
goods and chattels can be found, the officer shall indorse
on the writ of execution "No goods," and forthwith levy
the writ of execution upon the lands and tenements of the
debtor, which may be liable, to satisfy the judgment. 
SEc. 449. If the officer, by virtue of an execution issued
from any court of record in this state, shall levy the same 
on any goods and chattels claimed by any person other
than the defendant, or be requested by the plaintiff' to 
levy on any such goods and chattels, the officer may re-
quire the plaintiff to give him an undertaking, with good
and sufficient securities, to pay all costs and damages
that he may sustain by reason of the detention or sale of
such property ; and until such undertaking shall be given,
the officer may refuse to proceed as against such property. 
SEc. 450. In all cases where a sheriff, coroner or other
officer shall, by virtue of an execution, levy upon any
goods and chattels which shall remain upon his hands 
unsold, for want of bidders, for the want of time to adver- 
tise and sell, or any other reasonable cause, the officer
may, for his own security, take of the defendant an un-
dertaking, with security, in such sum as he may deem
sufficient, to the effect that the said property shall be deliv-
ered to the officer holding an execution for the sale of the
same, at the time and place appointed by said officer, 
either by notice" given in writing, to said defendant in
execution, or by advertisement, published in a newspaper
printed in the county, naming therein the day and place
of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver the goods
and chattels at the time and place mentioned in the notice
to him given, or to pay to the officer holding the execution
the full value of said goods and chattels, or the amount
of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given as afore- 
said, may be proceeded on as in other cases. 
SEC. 451. The officer who levies upon goods and chat- 
tels, by virtue of an execution issued by a court of record,
before he proceeds to sell the same shall cause public
notice to be given of the time and place of sale, for at 
least ten days before the day of sale. The notice shall be
given by advertisement, published in some newspaper
printed in the county, or, in case no newspaper be printed
therein, by setting up advertisements in five public places
in the county. Two advertisements shall be put up in the
township where the sale is to be held; and where goods
and chattels levied upon cannot be sold for want of bid- 
ders, the officer making such return shall annex to the
execution a true and perfect inventory of such goods and
chattels, and the plaintiff in such execution may there­
upon sue out another writ of execution, directing the sale
of the property levied upon as aforesaid; but such goods
and chattels shall not be sold, unless the time and place
of sale be advertised, as herein before provided. 
SEC. 452. When any writ shall issue, directing the sale
of property previously taken in execution, the officer issu­ 
ing said writ shall, at the request of the person entitled to
the benefit thereof, his agent or attorney, add thereto a
command to the officer to whom such writ shall be directed,
that if the property remaining in his hands not sold shall,
in his opinion, be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, he
shall levy the same upon lands and tenements, goods and
chattels, or either, as the law shall permit, being the prop-
erty of the judgment debtor, sufficient to satisfy the debt. 
SEC. 453. If execution be levied upon lands and tene­
ments, the officer levying such execution shall call an in­
quest of three disinterested householders, who shall be 
resident within the county where the lands taken in exe­
cution are situate, and administer to them an oath, impar-
tially to appraise the property so levied on; upon actual 
view ; and such householders shall forthwith return to said
officer, under their hands, an estimate of the ;eal value of 
said property. 
SEC. 454. The officer receiving such return shall forth­
with deposit a copy thereof with the clerk of the court 
from which the writ issued, and advertise and sell such
property, agreeably to the provisions of this article. 
SEC. 455. If, upon such return, as aforesaid, it appear,
by the inquisition, that two-thirds of the appraised value 
of said lands and tenements, so levied upon, is sufficient
to satisfy the execution, with costs, the judgment on which
such execution issued shall not operate as a .lien on the
residue of the debtor's estate, to the prejudice of any other
judgment creditor; but no such property shall be sold for
less than two-thirds of the value returned in the inquest;
and nothing in this section contained shall, in any wise,
extend to affect the sale of lands by the state, but all lands,
the property of individuals indebted to the state for any 
debt or taxes, or in any other manner, shall be sold, with­ 
out valuation, for the discharge of such debt or taxes,
agreeably to the laws in such cases made and provided. 
SEC. 456. If the property of any clerk, sheriff, coroner,
justice of the peace, constable, or any collector of state, 
county, town or township tax, shall be levied on for, or on
account of, any moneys that now are, or may hereafter be,
by them collected or received in their official capacity, the
property so levied on shall be sold without valuation. 
SEC. 457. Lands and tenements taken on execution shall
not be sold until the officer cause public notice of the time/'.; 
and place of sale to be given, for at least thirty days be-
fore the day of sale, by advertisement in some newspaper 
printed in the county, or, in case no newspaper be printed/()
in the county, in some newspaper in general circulation 
therein, and by putting up an advertisement upon the
court house door, and in five other public places in the~
county, two of which shall be in the township where such
lands and tenements lie. .All sales made without such ad- 
vertisement shall be set aside, on motion, by the court to
which the execution is returnable. 
SEc. 458. If the court, u pon the return of any writ of
execution, for the satisfaction of which any lands or tene- 
men ts have been sold, shall, after having carefully exam-
ined the proceedings of the officer, be satisfied that the sale 
bas, in all respects, been made in conformity to the provi-
sions of this article, the court shall direct the clerk to
make an entry on the journal that the court is satisfied
of the legality of such sale, and an order that the officer 
make to the purchaser a deed for such lands and tene-
ments ; and the officer, on making such sale, may retain 
the purchase money in his hands until the court shall have
examined his proceedings, as aforesaid, when he shall pay
the same to the person entitled thereto, agreeably to the 
order of the court. 
SEC. 459. The sheriff or other officer who, upon such
writ or writs of execution, shall sell the said lands and
tenements, or any part thereof, shall make to the pur-
chaser as good and sufficient deed of conveyance of the
lands and tenements sold, as the person or persons against
whom such writ or writs of execution were issued could
have made of the same, at or any time after they became
liable to the judgment. The deed shall be sufficient evi- 
dence of the legality of such sale, and the proceedings
therein, until the contrary be proved, and shall vest in the
purchaser as good and as perfect an estate in the premises
therein mentioned, as was vested in the party at, or airer, 
the time when such lands and tenements became liable to
the satisfaction of the judgment; and such deed of con­
veyance, to be made by the sheriff or other officer, shall 
recite the execution or executions, or the substance thereof,
and the names of the parties, the amount and date of ren­
dition of each judgment, by virtue whereof the said lands 
and tenements were sold as aforesaid, and shall be exe­
cuted, acknowledged and recorded as is or may be provi­
ded by law, to perfect the conveyance of real estate in
other cases. 
SEC. 460. The officer who levies upon goods and chattels,
or lands and tenements, or who is charged with the duty
of selling the same, by virtue of any writ of execution, 
may refuse to publish a notice of the sale thereof, by ad­
vertisement in a newspaper, until the party for whose ben­
efit such execution issued, his agent or attorney, shall
advance to such officer so much money as will be sufficient 
to discharge the fees of the printer for publishing such
notice. 
SEC. 461. Before any officer shall be excused from giving
the notification, mentioned in the last section, he shall 
demand of the party for whose benefit the execution was
issued, his agent or attorney (provided either of them
reside in the county), the fees in said section specified. 
SEC. 462. All sales of lands or tenements under execution shall be held at the court house, in the county in 
which such lands and tenements are situated. No sheriff
or other officer making the sale of property, either per- 
sonal or real, nor any appraiser of such property, shall,
either directly or indirectly, purchase the same; and 
every purchase, so made, shall be considered fraudulent
and void. 
SEC. 463. If lands or tenements, levied on as aforesaid,
are not sold upon one execution, other executions may be
issued to sell the property so levied upon. 
SEC. 464. In all cases where two or more executions
shall be put into the hands of any sheriff or other officer,
and it shall be necessary to levy on real estate to satisfy 
the same, and either of the judgment creditors, in whose
favor one or more of said executions are issued, shall
require the sheriff or other officer to levy said executions,
or so many thereof as may be required, on separate par­
cels of the real property of the judgment debtor or debtors,
giving to the officer making the levy on behalf of the 
creditor, whose execution may, by the provisions of this article, be entitled to a preference, the choice of such part
of the real property of the judgment debtor or debtors, 
as will be sufficient, at two-thirds of the appraised value, 
to satisfy the same ; and in all cases where two or more
executions, which are entitled to no preference over each 
other, are put into the hands of the same officer, it shall
be the duty of the officer, when required, to levy the same
on separate parcels of the real property of the judgment 
debtor or debtors, when, in the opinion of the appraisers,
the same may be divided without material injury ; and if
the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient, at
two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy all the execu­
tions chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall be
levied on, to satisfy each execution, as will bear the same
proportion in value to the whole, as the amount due to
the execution bears to the amount of all the executions
chargeable thereon, as near as may be, according to
the appraised value of each separate parcel of said real
property. 
SEC. 465. If the term of service of the sheriff or other
officer who has made, or shall hereafter make sale of any
lands and tenements, shall expire, or if the sheriff or other 
officer shall be absent, or be rendered unable, by death
or otherwise, to make a deed of conveyance of the same, 
any succeeding sheriff or other officer, on receiving a
certificate from the court from which execution issued for 
the sale of said lands and tenements, signed by the clerk,
by order of said court, setting forth that sufficient proof
has been made to the court that such sale was fairly and 
legally made; and on tender of the purchase money, or
if the same or any part thereof be paid, then, on proof
of such payment and tender of the balance, if any, may
execute to the said purchaser or purchasers, or his or their
legal representatives, a deed of conveyance of said lands
and tenements so sold. Such deed shall be as good and
valid in law, and have the same effect, as if the sheriff or
other officer who made the sale had executed the same. 
SEC. 466. If, on any sale made as aforesaid, there shall
be in the hands of the sheriff or other officer, more money 
than is sufficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution,
with interest and costs, the sheriff or other officer shall, on
demand, pay the balance to the defendant in execution, or
his legal representatives. 
thereof. 
SEC. 467. If any judgment or judgments, in satisfac­
tion of which any lands or tenements are sold, shall at
any time thereafter be reversed, such reversal shall i::tot
defeat or affect the title of the purchaser or purchasers ;
but, in such cases, restitution shall be made, by the judg-
ment creditors, of the money, for which such lands or
tenements were sold, with lawful interest from the day of
sale. 
SEC. 468. No judgment heretofore rendered, or which
erea r may e ren ere , on W IC execution B a no
have been taken out and levied before the expiration of
one year next after its rendition, shall operate as a lien on
the estate of any debtor, to the prejudice of any other 
judgment creditor. But in all cases where judgment has
been or may be rendered in the supreme court, and a
special mandate awarded to the district court to carry the
same into execution, the lien of the judgment creditor
shall continue for one year after the first day of the term
of the district court to which such mandate may be 
directed. Nothing in this section contained shall be
construed to defeat the lien of any judgment creditor who
shall fail to take out execution and cause a levy to be 
made, as herein provided, when such failure shall be
occasioned by appeal, proceedings in error, injunction, or 
by vacancy in the office of sheriff or coroner, or the disa­
bility of such officer, until one year after such disability
shall be removed. In all cases where real estate has been
or may hereafter be taken on execution and appraised,
and twice advertised and offered for sale, and shall remain
unsold for want of bidders, it shall be the duty of the
court from which such execution issued, on motion of the
plaintiff, to set aside such appraisement and order a new
one to be made, or to set aside such levy and appraise­
ment and award a new execution to issue, as the case may 
require.
SEC. 469. The sheriff or other officer, to whom any writ 
of execution shall be directed, shall return such writ to 
ixty
the court to which the same is returnable, within si 
SEC. 470. In all cases where judgment is rendered in
any court of record within this state, upon any instrument 
of writing in which two or more persons are jointly and
severally bound, and it shall be made to appear to the 
court, by parol or other testimony, that one or more of said persons so bound, signed the same as surety or bail, for his or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said court, in recording the judgment htereon, to certify which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which are sureties or bail. And the clerk of the court aforesaid shall issue execution on such judgment, commanding the hseriff or other oficer to cause the money to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor; but for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor to make the same, that he cause the same to be made or the goods and chattels, lands and tnements, of the surety or bail. In all cases, the property, both personal and real, fo the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail shall be taken in execution. 

SEC. 471. Each householder, summoned to appraise real estate under the provisions of this chapter, shall be allowed
and receive for his services the sum of fifty nt f r ach 
day he may be so engaged as such apprc i r to b ol-
lected on the execution by virtue of whi h th pr p rty
appraised was levied on, if claimed: t th tim f making
the return of such appraisement. And wh n any house-
holder, summoned as aforesaid, shall fail to a p ar at th 
time or place appointed by the offi.c r and dischar hi
duty as appraiser, he shall, on com.._ laint b ing mad to
any justice of the peace of the to hip in which such
householder resides, forfeit and pay th um of fifty c nts 
for every such neglect, unless he can r nd r a r a ona bl
excuse. Such sum shall be collected y said ju ti 'and
paid in to the township treasurer, for the us of th town- 
ship. 
SEC. 472. If any sheriff or other flic .r hall refuse or
neglect to execute. any writ of execn ti n to him dire ted,
which has come to his hands, or shall n gl ct or r fu to 
sell any goods and chattels, lands and t n ment · or shall
neglect to call an inquest and return a copy ther of forth­
with, to the clerk's office, or shall n glect to return any 
writ of execution to the proper court, on or before the
return day thereof; or shall neglect to return a just and 
perfect inventory of all and singular the goods and chat-
tels by him taken in execution, unless the said sheriff or 
other officer shall return that he has levied and made the
amount of the debt, damages and costs; or shall refuse or 
neglect, on demand, to pay over to the plaintiff, his agent
or attorney of record, all moneys by him collected or re­
ceived for the use of said party, at any time after collect­
ing or receiving the same, except as provided in section 
four hundred and fifty-eight; or shall neglect or refuse, on
demand made by the defendant, his agent or attorney of 
record, to pay over all moneys by him received for _any
sale made, beyond what is sufficient to satisfy the writ or
writs of execution, with interest and legal costs, such
sheriff or other officer shall, on motion in court, and two
days' notice thereof, in writing, be amerced in the amount
of said debt, damages and costs, with ten per cent. thereon, 
to and for the use of said plaintiff or defendant, as the
case· may be. 
SEC. 473. If any clerk of a court shall neglect or refuse,
on demand made by the person entitled thereto, his agent
or attorney of record, to pay over all money by him re­
ceived in his official capacity, for the use of such persons,
every such clerk may be amerced, and the proceedings
against him and his sureties shall be the same as provided
for, in the foregoing section, against sheriffs and their
sureties. 
SEC. 474. When the cause of amercement is for refusing
to pay over money collected as aforesaid, the said sheriff 
or other officer shall not be amerced in a greater sum than
the amount so withheld, with ten per cent. thereon. 
SEC. 475. When an execution is issued to the sheriff of
any county other than that in which the judgment was 
rendered, the sheriff, after indorsing the date of its recep-
tion thereon, shall deliver the same to the clerk of the dis- 
trict court of his county, who shall thereupon enter the
same in the execution docket in the same manner a! if it
had issued from the court of which he is clerk ; and before
the sheriff shall return any such writ, he shall cause his
return to be entered in like manner.· 
SEc. 476. When execution shall be issued in any county 
in this state, and directed to the sheriff or coroner of 
another county, it shall be lawful for such sheriff or cor­
oner having the execution, after having discharged all the
duties required of him by law, to inclose such execution, 
by mail, to the clerk of the court who issued the same.
On proof being made by such sheriff or coroner, that the 
execution was mailed soon enough 
have reached the 
office where it was issued within the time prescribed by 
law, the sheriff or coroner shall not be liable for any
amercement or penalty if it do not reach the office in due
time. 
SEC. 477. No sheriff shall forward, by mail, any money
made on any such execution, unless he shall be specially 
instructed to do it by the plaintiff, his agent or attorney of 
record, In all cases of a motion to amerce a sheriff, or
other officer of any county other than that from which the
execution issued, notice in writing shall be given to such
officer, as herein before required, by leaving it with him, or
at his office, at least fifteen days before the day on which 
such motion shall be niade. All amercements so procured
shall be entered on the record of the court, and shall. have
the same force and effect as a judgment. 
SEC. 478. Each and every surety of any sheriff or other
officer may be made party to the judgment rendered as 
aforesaid, against the sheriff or other officer, by action, to
be commenced and prosecuted as in other cases; but the
goods and chattels, lands and tenements of any such
surety shall not be liable to be taken on execution, when
sufficient goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the
sheriff or other officer, against whom execution may be is­
sued, can be found to satisfy the same. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent either party from proceeding
against such sheriff or other officer, by attachment, at his
election. 
SEc. 479. In cases where a sheriff or other officer may
be amerced, and shall not have collected the amount of the 
original judgment, he shall be permitted to sue out an
execution and collect the amount of said judgment, in the
name of the original plaintiff, for his use. 
SEC. 480. When property, liable to an execution against
several persons, is sold thereon, and more than a due pro- 
portion of the judgment is laid upon the property of one
of them, or one of them pays, without a sale, more than 
his proportion, he may compel contribution from the
others ; and when a judgment is against several, and is
upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, 
and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either
by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel 
repayment from the principal; in such case, the person
so paying or contributing is entitled to the benefit of the 
judgment, to enforce contribution or repayment, if within
ten days after his payment he file, with the clerk of the 
court where the judgment was rendered, notice of his
payment and claim to contribution or repayment. Upon
a filing of such notice, the clerk shall make an entry
thereof in the margin of the docket. 
SEC. 481. When a judgment debtor has not personal or
real property, subject to levy on execution, sufficient to
satisfy the judgment, any equitable interest which he
may ha_ve in real estate, as mortgagor, mortgagee, or 
otherwise, or any interest he may have in any banking,
turnpike, bridge, or other joint stock company, or any 
interest he may have in any money, contracts, claims, or
choses in action, due or to become due to him, or in any
judgment or decree, or any money, goods or effects which
he may have in the possession of any person, body politic
or corporate, shall be subject to the payment of such
judgment, by action, or as hereinafter prescribed. 
SEC. 482. When an execution against a judgment debtor,
or one of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to
-the sheriff of the county where he resides, or, if he do not
reside in the state, to the sheriff of the county where the 
judgment was rendered, or a transcript of a justice's
judgment has been filed, is .returned unsatisfied, in whole 
or in part, the judgment creditor is entitled to an order of
the probate judge, or judge of the district. court, of the
county to which the execution was issued, requiring such
debtor to appear and answer concerning his property,
before such judge, or a referee appointed by such judge,
at a time and place specified in such order, within the
county to which the execution was issued. 
SEC. 483. After the issuing of an execution against
property, and upon the affidavit of the Judgment credi­ 
tor, his agent or attorney, that the judgment debtor has
property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the sat­
isfaction of the judgment, the probate judge or judge of
the district court of the county in which the order may be
served, may, by order, require the judgment debtor to
appear, at a time and place in said county, to answer
concerning the same ; and such proceedings may there­
upon be had, for the application of the property of the
judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment,
as hereinafter prescribed. 
SEc. 484. Instead of the order requiring the attendance 
of the judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sec­
tions, the judge may, upon proof to his satisfaction, by 
affidavit of the party or otherwise, that there is danger of
the debtor leaving the state, or concealing himself, to avoid
the examination herein mentioned, issue a warrant requir­
ing the sheriff to arrest him and bring him before such
judge, within the county in which the debtor may be
arrested. Such a warrant can be issued only by a probate
judge, or the judge of the district court, of the county in
which such debtor resides or may be arrested. Upon be­
ing brought before the judge, he shall be examined on
oath, and other witnesses may be examined on either side ;
and if, on such examination, it appear that there is danger
of the debtor leaving the state, and that he has property
which he unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, he
may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, in such sum
as the judge may prescribe, with one or more sureties,
that he will, from time to time, attend for examination
before the judge or· referee, as shall be directed. In de­ 
fault of entering into such undertaking, he may be com­
mitted to the jail of the county, by warrant of the judge,
as for a contempt. 
SEC. 485. No person shall, on examination pursuant to
this article, be excused from answering any question on
the ground that his examination will tend to convict him
of a fraud; but his answer shall not be used as evidence
against him in a prosecution for such fraud. 
SEC. 486. After the issuing of execution against prop-
erty, any person indebted to the judgment debtor may
pay to the sheriff the amount of his debt,. or so much
thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execution; and
the sheriff's receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the
amount so paid, or directed to be credited by the judgment
creditor on the execution. 
SEC. 487. After the issuing or return of an execution
against property of a judgment debtor, or of any one of 
several debtors in the same judgment, where it is made
to appear by affidavit or otherwise, to the satisfaction of
the judge, that there is reason to believe that any person
or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or
is indebted to him, the judge may, by an order, require
such person or corporation, or any officer or mem her 
thereof, to appear at a specified time and place within tho
county in which such person or corporation may he served 
with the order to answer, and answer the same. The
judge may, also, in his discretion, require notice of such
proceeding to be given to any party in the action, in such
manner as may seem to him proper. 
SEC. 488. Witnesses may be required, upon the order
of the judge, to appear and testify upon any proceedings
under this article, in the same manner as upon the trial
of an issue. 
SEC. 489. The party or witness may be required to 
attend before the judge, or before a referee appointed by
the court or judge. All examinations and answers before
a judge or a referee, under this article, must be on oath,
and reduced to writing; but when a corporation answers,
the answer must be on oath of an officer thereof. 
SEc. 490. The judge may order any property of the
judgment debtor, not exempt by law, in the hands either 
of himself or any other person or corporation, or due to
the judgment debtor, to be applied toward the satisfaction 
of the judgment, and may enforce the same by proceed­
ings for contempt, in case of refusal or disobedience; but
the earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at any
time within three months next preceding the order, can-
not be so applied, when it is made to appear, by the
debtor's affidavit or otherwise, that such earnings are 
necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or
partly by his labor. 
SEc. 491. The judge may also, by order, appoint the
sheriff of the proper county, or other suitable person, a 
receiver of the property of the judgment debtor, in the
same manner and with like authority as if the appoint­
ment was made by the court. The judge may also, by
order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property
of the judgment debtor, not exempt by law, and any
interference therewith. 
SEC. 492. If it shall appear that the judgment debtor
has any equitable interest in real estate in the county in 
which proceedings are had, as mortgagor or mortgagee, or
otherwise, and the interest of said debtor can be ascer-
tained as between himself and the person or persons hold­
ing the legal estate, or the person or persons having a lien
on or interest in the same, without controversy as to the
interest of such person or persons holding such legal
estate or interest therein, or lien on the same, the receiver
may be ordered to sell and convey such real est.ate, or the 
debtor's interest therein. Such sale shall be conducted,
in all respects, in the same manner as is provided by this
code for the sale of real estate upon execution; and the
proceedings of sale shall, before the execution of the deed,
be approved by the court in which the judgment was ren­
dered, or the transcript has been filed as aforesaid, as in
case of sale upon execution. 
SEC. 493. If the sheriff shall be appointed receiver, he
and his sureties shall be liable on his official bond for the
faithful discharge of his duties as receiver, and no addi-
tional oath shall be required of him; if any other person
shall be appointed receiver, he shall give a written under-
taking, in such sum as shall be prescribed by the judge,
with one or more sureties, to the effect that he will faith-
fully discharge the duties of receiver, and he shall also
take an oath to the same effect before acting as such re-
ceiver. The undertaking mentioned in this section shall
be to the state of Kansas, and actions may be prosecuted
for a breach thereof, by any person interested, in the same
manner as upon a sheriff's official bond. 
SEC. 494. The receiver shall be vested with the property
not exempt by law, or such part thereof as the court or
judge may order, and may sue for, collect, and recover, 
and dispose of the same, and apply the proceeds accord-
ing to the order of the court or judge, and generally may
do such acts concerning the property as the court or judge
may authorize. 
SEc. 495. The court or judge may order the delivery, to
the receiver, by the judgment debtor, or any other person
in whose possession the same may be, any notes, bills, ac-
counts, contracts, books or other evidences of indebted-
ness or right in action, of the judgment debtor, and may
enforce such order by attachment, as for a contempt. 
SEC. 496. The judge or referee, acting under the provi-
sions of this.article, sha11 have power to continue his pro-
ceedings, from time to time, until they shall be completed. 
SEc. 497. The judge may, in his discretion, order a refer-
ence to a referee, agreed upon or appointed by him, to
report the evidence or the facts. 
SEc. 498. If any person, party or witness disobey an 
order of the judge or referee, duly served, such person,
party or witness may be punished by the judge, as for a 
contempt. 
SEc. 499. The order mentioned in sections four hundred
and eighty-two, four hundred and eighty-three, four hun­
dred and ninety-one, and four hundred and eighty-seven,
shall be in writing, and signed by the judge making the
same, and shall be served as a summons in other cases.
The judge shall reduce all his orders to writing, which, 
together with a minute of his proceedings, signed by him­
self, shall be filed with the clerk of the court of the county 
in which the judgment is rendered, or the transcript of the
justice filed, and the clerk shall enter on his execution 
docket the time of filing the same. 
SEC. 500. The judge shall allow to clerks, sheriffs, ref­
erees, receivers and witnesses such compensation as is al­
lowed for like services in other cases, to be taxed as costs 
in the case, and shall enforce, by order, the collection
thereof, from such party or parties as ought to pay the same. 
SEC. 501. The clerk shall be allowed such fees, for ser­
vices under this head, as are allowed for similar services 
in other cases. 
SEC. 502. When an execution shall have been returned
unsatisfied, the judgment creditor may file an affidavit of 
himself, his agent or attorney, in the office of the clerk,
setting forth that he has good reasons to, and does, believe
that any person or corporation, to be named, has property
of the judgment debtor, or is indebted to him; and there­
upon the clerk shall issue an order, requiring such person
or corporation to answer, on or before a day to be named
in the order, not less than ten nor more than twenty days
from the date of issuing the same, all interrogatories that
may be propounded by the judgment creditor, concerning
such indebtedness or property. 
SEC. 503. The judgment creditor, or his attorney, shall
prepare interrogatories concerning such indebtedness or
property, a copy of which shall be served on the garnishee 
at the time of the service of the order, or within three days
thereafter. And the garnishee shall, on or before the day 
required 'in the order, file with the clerk full and true
answers to all such interrogatories, verified by his affidavit. 
SEo. 504. All subsequent proceedings against the gar­
nishee shall be the same as in cases of attachment, as far 
as applicable.  
SEc. 505. An execution against the person of the judg- 
ment debtor shall require the officer to arrest such debtor,
and commit him to the jail of the county, until he pay the 
judgment, or is discharged according to law. 
SEc. 506. An execution against the person of the debtor

terest or stock in some corporation or company, which he
fraudulently conceals with the like intent. Third, When

property, or rights in action, or has converted the same

execution. Fourth, When he fraudulently contracted the
debt, or incurred the obligation, upon which the judgment

in section five hundred and six. 
SEC. 508. A justice of the peace may issue an execution
against the person of a judgment debtor, upon being sat-

lars, by the like affidavit and evidence. 
SEC. 509. In all cases in which the judgment debtor was
arrested before judgment, and has not been released from
imprisonment by an application for relief, as an insolvent 
debtor, and where the order for such arrest has not been
adjudged improper, an execution against the person of
such judgment debtor may issue of course. 
SEc. 510. Any person taken in execution as aforesaid,
shall be discharged by delivering or setting off to the
officer serving the same, if issued from a court of record,
real or personal property, if issued from a justice of the

judgment, and costs, for which the writ is issued.

of this article shall be entitled to prison bounds, which 
shall be coextensive with the county, upon executing an
undertaking, with one or more sufficient sureties, to be

beyond the prison bounds before being discharged accord­
ing to law, he will pay to the plaintiff the amount of the
execution, with interest and costs ; but in case the person 
shall be out of jail, in prison bounds, the judgment cred­
itor, upon whose judgment he was imprisoned, shall be
entitled to execution against the lands and tenements,
goods and chattels of the debtor, and all other remedies
prescribed by this code for the collection of debts.

was or might be rendered, on such terms as may be just. 
SEC. 515. If the execution be for the delivery of the
possession of real or personal property, it shall require 
the officer to deliver the same, particularly describing the
property, to the party entitled thereto, and may, at the
same time, require the officer to satisfy any costs or dam­
ages, recovered in the same judgment, out of the goods
and chattels of the party against whom it was rendered;
and, for the want of such goods and chattels, then out of
the lands and tenements ; and in this respect it shall be
deemed an execution against the property. 
SEC. 516. When the judgment is not for the recovery of
money or real property, the same may be enforced by 
attachment, by the court rendering judgment, upon motion
made, or by a rule of the court upon the defendant; but
in either case, notice of the motion or a service of a copy
of the rule shall be made on the defendant, a reasonable
time before the order of attachment is made. 
SEC. 617. In special cases, not hereinbefore provided
for, the execution shall conform to the judgment or order
of the court. When a judgment for any specified amount,
and also for the sale of specific real or personal property,

satisfy the amount of the debt or damages and costs, be
not made from the sale of the property specified, an exe­ 
cution may issue for the balance, as in other cases. 
SEc. 518. In all cases in which a judgment shall be ren-
dered by a justice of the peace, the party in. whose favor 
the judgment shall be rendered may file a transcript of
such judgment in the office of the clerk of the district
court of the county in which the judgment was rendered ;
and thereupon the clerk shall, on the day on which the
same shall be filed, enter the case on the appearance

time of filing the transcript; and shall also enter the same
on the judgment docket, as in case of a judgment rendered
in the court of which he is clerk. 
SEC. 519. Such judgment shall be a lien upon the real
estate of the judgment debtor, from the day of filing the 
transcript, in the same manner and to the same extent as
if the judgment had been rendered in the district court. 
SEc. 520. Execution may be issued thereon, to the sher-
iff, by the clerk of the court, in the same manner as if the 
judgment had been taken in court ; and the sheriff shall
execute and return the same, as other executions ; and in
case of sale of real estate, his proceedings shall be exam-
ined and approved by the court as in other cases. 
SEc. 521. The justice of the peace shall certify on the
transcript the amount, if any, paid on such judgment. 
SEC. 522. If such judgment becomes dormant, or if any
of the parties thereto die before the same is satisfied, it 
may be revived in the same manner as other judgments 
in the district court; and a certified copy of the entry of
such transcript may be filed in the office of the clerk of
the di trict court of any other county, and shall be alien
on th r al state of the debtor in such county, from the 
date of the filing of such copy.

plaintiff in error, to the adv r ·e party with on or more
sufficient sureties, as follows: First, Wh .n the judgment
or final order sought to be reversed dire ·t the payment of
money, the written undertaking shall be in double the 
47 
amount of the judgment or order, to the effect that the

in whole or in part. Second, When it directs the execu­
tion of a conveyance or other instrument, the undertaking 
shall be in such a sum as may be prescribed by any court
of record in this state, or any judge thereof, to the effect

the opposite party all damages that he may sustain by
reason of such proceedings, and all costs in the supreme 
court.
SEc. 654. Before an undertaking shall operate to stay 
execution of the jhdgment or order, a petition in error
must be filed in the appellate court, and the execution of
the undertaking and the sufficiency of sureties must be
approved by the court in which the judgment was rendered
or order made, or by the clerk thereof; and the clerk shall 
indorse said approval, signed by himself, upon the under­
taking, and file the same in his office, for the defendant in

modified, he may, upon leave obtained from the court
below, or a judge thereof in vacation, proceed to enforce

sureties, to the effect that if the judgment be reversed or
modified, he will make full restitution to the plaintiff in 
error, of the money by him received under the judgment.

ment or making of the final order complained of; or in
case the person entitled to such proceeding be an infant, a
person of unsound mind or imprisoned, within three years
as aforesaid, exclusive of the time .of such disability. 
SEC. 567. No proceeding to reverse, vacate or modify
any judgment or final order of a justice of the peace shall 
operate as a stay of execution, unless the clerk of the

executed on the part of the plaintiff in error, by one or
more sureties, to be approved by the clerk, to the effect: 
First, When the judgment directs the payment of money,
that the plaintiff will pay all costs which have accrued or 
may accrue in such proceedings in error, together with the
amount of any judgment that may be rendered against
the plaintiff in error, either upon and after the a:ffirmance
thereof in the district court, or on the further trial of the
case in such court, after the judgment of the court below
shall have been set aside or reversed. Second, When the 
judgment directs the delivery of the possession of lands
or tenements by the plaintiff in error, he will not commit 
or suffer to be committed any waste thereon ; and if the
judgment be affirmed by the court above, or if judgment
be rendered against the plaintiff upon the further trial of
the case, after the judgment of the court below shall have

rendered, or re~and the cause to the court below for such 
judgment. The court reversing such judgment' or final
order shall not issue execution in causes that are removed 
before them on error, on which they pronounce judgment
as aforesaid, but shall send a special mandate to the court
below, as the case may require, to award execution there­
upon; and such court, to which such special mandate is
sent, shall proceed in such cases in the same manner as if
such judgment or final order had been rendered therein. 
In cases decided by the supreme court, when the facts
are agreed to by the parties, or found by the court below,
or a referee, and when it does not appear, by exception or
otherwise, that such findings are against the evidence in
the case, the supreme court shall send a mandate to the
court below, directing it to render snch judgment in the
premises as it should have rendered on the facts agreed to
or found in the case. 
SEc. 560. It shall be the duty of the judges of the su- 
preme court to prepare, and file with the papers in each
case, full notes of the opinion of the court upon the ques­ 
tions of law arising in the case, within sixty days after the
decision of the same ; and the opinion so filed shall be
treated as a part of the record in the case, but no costs
shall be charged therefor, except for copies thereof ordered
by a party ; and no mandate shall be sent to the court be- 
low, until the opinion provided for by this section has
been filed. 
SEc. 561. A syllabus of the points of law decided in
any case in the supreme court shall be stated, in writing, 
by the judge delivering the opinion of the court, and filed
with the papers of the case, which shall be confined to 
points of law arising from the facts in the case, that have
been determined by the court; and the syllabus shall be
submitted to the judges concurring therein, for revisal be-
fore filing thereof, and it shall be filed with the papers,
without alteration, unless by consent of the judges con­
curring therein ; and a copy of such syllabus shall, in all
cases, be sent to the' court below, by the clerk of the
supreme court, with the mandate provided for by section
five hundred and fifty-nine of this act.

any of the plaintiffs, or any of the defendants. 
SEC. 618. After the interests of all the parties shall have
been ascertained, the court shall make an order specifying
the interests of the respective parties, and directing par­
tition to be made accordingly. 
SEC. 610. Upon making such order, the court shall ap­
point three commissioners to make partition into the requi-
site number of shares. ,

ticular portions to any one of the parties. 
SEc. 621. Before entering upon their duties, such com­
missioners shall take and subscribe an oath that they will 
perform their duties faithfully and impartially, to the best
of their ability. 
SEC. 622. The commissioners shall make partition of the
property among the parties according to their respective
interests, if such partition can be made without manifest
injury. But if such partition cannot be made, the com- ·
missioners shall make a valuation and appraisement of the
property. They shall make a report of their proceedings 
to the court, forthwith. 
SEC. 623. Any party may file exceptions to the report
of the commissioners, and the court may, for good cause, 
set aside such report, and appoint other commissioners, or
refer the matter back to the same commissioners. 
SEc. 624. If partition be made by -the commissioners,
and no exceptions are filed to their report, the court shall 
render judgment that such partition be and remain firm
and effectual forever. 
SEc. 625. If partition cannot be made, and the property
shall have been valued and appraised, any one or more of 
the parties may elect to take the same at the appraisement,
and the court may direct the sheriff to make a deed to the
party or parties so electing, on payment to the other par­
ties of their proportion of the appraised value. 
SEc. 626. If none of the parties elect to take the prop­
erty at the valuation, or if several of the parties elect to
take the same at the valuation, in opposition to each other, 
the court shall make an order directing the sheriff of the
county to sell the same, in the same manner as in sales of
real estate on execution ; but no sale shall be made at less
than two-thirds of the valuation placed upon the property
by the commissioners. 
SEc. 627. The sheriff shall make return of his proceed­ 
ings to the court, and if the sale made by him shall be a p­

shall direct. 
SEc. 628. The court making partition shall tax the costs,
attorneys' fees and expenses which may accrue in the
action, and apportion the same among the parties, accord­
ing to theirrespective interests, and may award execution
therefor, as in other cases.

order, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article,

of such tenant or other person. 
SEC. 632. Any sub-contractor, who intends to furnish
materials or perform labor, may give notice, in writing, to

of the following causes: First, When either of the parties 
had a former husband or wife living at the time of the
subsequent marriage. Second, Abandonment for one year. 
Third, Adultery. Fourth, Impotency. Fifth, ,vhen the/~,

than her husband. Sixth, Extreme cruelty. Seventh, 
Fraudulent contract. Eighth, Habitual drunkenness. 
Ninth, Gross neglect of duty. Tenth, The conviction of a
felony, and imprisonment in the penitentiary therefor, sub-
sequent to the marriage. 
SEc. 640. The plaintiff in an action for divorce must
have been an actual resident, in good faith, of the state,
for one year next preceding the filing of the petition, and
a resident of the county in which the action is brought at 
the time the petition is filed. 
SEC. 641. The petition must be verified as true, by the 
affidavit of the plaintiff. A summons may issue thereon,
and shall be served, or publication made, as in other cases. 
When service by publication is proper, a copy of the pe- 
tition, with a copy of the publication notice attached
thereto, shall, within three days after the first publication 
is made, be inclosed in an envelope addressed to the de­
fendant, at his or her place of residence, postage paid, and
deposited in the nearest post office, unless the plaintiff 
shall make and file an affidavit that such residence is un/
known to the plaintiff, and cannot be ascertained by any
means within the control of the plaintiff . 
SEC. 642. The defendant, in his or her answer, may al-
lege a cause for a divorce against the plaintiff, and may 
have the same relief thereupon as he or she would be entitled to for a like cause if he or she were plaintiff. When
new matter is set up in the answer, it shall be verified as 
to such new matter by the affidavit of the defendant. 
SEC. 643. When the parties appear to be in equal wrong,
the court may, in its discretion, refuse to grant a divorce; 
but in any such case, or in any other case where a divorce
is refused, the court may, for good cause shown, make
such order as may be proper for the custody, maintenance
and education of the children, or the control and disposi­
tion of the property of the parties as may be proper. 
SEC. 644. After a petition has been filed in an action for
a divorce, or for alimony alone, the court, or a judge there- 
of in vacation, may make and enforce, by attachment,
such order to restrain the disposition of the property of 
either party, or for the control of the children and support
of the wife, during the pendency of the action, as ma.y be 
right and proper ; and, also, may make such order, rela­
tive to the expenses of the suit, as will insure to the wife
an efficient preparation of her case ; and on granting a di­
vorce in favor of the wife, or refusing one on the a pplica­
tion of the husband, the court may require the husband to
pay all reasonable expenses of the wife in the prosecution
or defense of the action. 
SEC. 645. When a divorce is granted, the court shall
make provision for guardianship, custody, support and
education of the minor children of the marriage, and may 
modify or change any order in this respect, whenever cir-
cumstances render such change proper. 
SEc. 646. When the divorce is granted for the fault of the
husband, the court may adjudge to the wife a reasonable
sum as alimony, to be paid by the husband in gross, or in
installments, out of his estate ; and any such allowance
shall have the same effect, and may be enforced, as any 
other money judgment. 
SEC. 647. A divorce granted at the instance of one party,
shall operate as a dissolution of the marriage contract as 
to both, and shall be a bar to any claim of the party for 
whose fault it was granted, in or to the property of the
other. 
SEC. 648. When either of the parties to a marriage shall
· be incapable, from want of age or understanding, of con­ 
. tracting such marriage, the same may be declared void by
the district court, in an action brought by the incapable
party ; but the children of such marriage, begotten before
the same is annulled, shall be legitimate. Cohabitation
after such incapacity ceases, shall be a sufficient defense 
to any such action.
SEc. 649. The wife may obtain alimony from the hus­ 
band without a divorce, in an action brought for that pur­
pose in the district court, for any of the causes for which
a divorce may be granted. The husband may make the
same defense to such action as he might to an action for a
divorce, and may, for sufficient cause, obtain a divorce
from the wife in such action. · 
SEc. 650. Upon the trial of an action for a divorce, or
for alimony, the court may admit proof of the admissions
of the parties to be received in evidence, carefully exclud­ 
ing such as shall appear to have been obtained by conniv­
ance, fraud, coercion or other improper means. Proof of 
'cohabitation, and reputation of the marriage of the parties,
may be received as evidence of the marriage. But no di­
vorce shall be granted without proof. 
SEc. 651. A wife who resides in this state at the time of
applying for a divorce, shall be deemed a resident of this
state, though her husband resides elsewhere.

cise powers not conferred by law. Fifth, For any other 
cause for which a remedy might have been heretofore
obtained by writ of quo uiarranto or information in the 
nature of quo ioarramto. 
SEc. 654. When the action is brought by the attorney
general or the county attorney of any county, of his own 
motion, or when directed to do so by competent authority,
it shall be prosecuted in the name of the state. But where
the action is brought by a person claiming an interest in
the office, franchise or corporation, which is the subject of 
the action, it shall be prosecuted in the name of such
person. Whenever the action is brought against a person 
for usurping an office, by the attorney general or the
county attorney, he shall set forth in the petition the name 
of the person rightfully entitled to the office, and his right
or title thereto. When the action in such case is brought
by the person claiming title, he may claim and recover 
any damages he may have sustained. 
SEC. 655. In every case contesting the right to an office,

the functions of the office, after he has been q nalified as
required by law; and the court shall order the defendant
to deliver over all the books and papers in his custody or
within his power, belonging to the office from which he
shall have been ousted. 
SEc. 657. If the defendant shall refuse or neglect to
deliver over the books and papers, pursuant to the order, the court, or judge thereof, shall enforce the order by attachment and imprisonment.
SEC. 658. When judgment is rendere din favor of the plaintiff, he may, if he has not claimed his damages in the action, have a separate action for the damages at any time within one year after the judgment. The court may give judgment of ouster against the defendant, and exclude him from the office, franchise or corporate rights; and in cases of corporations, that the same shall be dissolved.
SEC. 659. If judgment be rendered against any corporation, or against any persons claiming to be a corporation, the court may cause the costs to be collected by execution against th eperson claiming to be a corporation, or by attachment against the directors or other officers of the corporation, and may restrain any disposition of the effects of the corporation, appoint a receiver of its property and effects, take an account, and make a distribution thereof among the creditors and persons entitled.

cannot be found, or shall refuse admittance to the sheriff,
the same may be served by leaving it at the residence of
the person to whom it is directed, or by affixing the same
on some conspicuous place, either of his dwelling house
or where the party is confined or under restraint. 
SEC. 667. The sheriff or other person to whom the writ
is directed shall make immediate return thereof, and if 
he neglect or refuse, after due service, to make return, or

ter in avoidance ; the new matter shall be verified, except

continuance thereof, shall discharge the party.

ity of any judgment or process, whereby the party is in

SEC. 689. This writ may not be issued in any case where
there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary 
course of the law. It may issue on the i~ormation of the,
party beneficially interested. S'jLJ,:- i' [ / ~1 .: r- ~~ ~, .: I 1 
SEc. 690. The writ is either alternative or peremptory. 
.The alternative writ must state, concisely, the facts,
showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the
act, and his omission to perform it, and command him
that immediately upon the receipt of the writ, or at some
other specified time, he do the act req nired to be performed 
or show cause before the court whence the writ issued, at 
a specified time and place, why he has not done so ; and
that he then and there return the writ with his certificate
of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory
writ must be in a similar form, except that the words
requiring the defendant to show cause why he has not
done as commanded, must be omitted. 
SEC. 691. When the right to require the performance of
the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can 
be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus
may be allowed in the first instance ; in all other cases,
the alternative writ must be first issued. 
SEc. 692. The motion for the writ must be made upon
affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the appli- 
cation to be given to the adverse party, or may grant an
order to show cause why it should not be allowed, or may
grant the writ without notice. 
SEC. 693. The allowance of the writ must be indorsed
thereon, -signed by the judge of the court granting it, and 
the WJi't must be served personally upon the defendant ; if
the defendant, duly served, neglect to return the same, he
shall bE\ proceeded against, as for a cofttempt. 
SEC. 694. On the return day of the }Jternative writ, or
such further day as the court may allow, the party on 
whom the writ shall have been served may show cause, by
answer made in the same manner as an ailS.l'7'er to a peti- 
tion in a civil action. · 
SEC. 695. If no answer be made, a peremptory man- 
damus must be allowed against the defendant; if answer
be made, containing new matter, the same shall not, in any 
respect, conclude the plaintiff, who may, on the trial or
other proceeding, avail himself of any valid objections to· 
[its] sufficiency, or may countervail it by proof, either in
direct denial or by way of avoidance. 
SEc. 696. No other pleading or written allegation is al-
lowed than the writ and answer ; these are the pleadings 
in the case, and have the same effect, and are to be con-
strued and may be amended in the same manner, as plead- 
ings in a civil action; and the issues thereby joined must
be tried, and the further proceedings thereon had, in the
same manner as in a civil action. 
SEC. 697. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he shall
recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be 
ascertained by the court or jury, or by referees, as in a
civil action, and costs ; and a peremptory mandamus shall
also be granted to him without delay. 
SEC. 698. A recovery of damages, by virtue of this article, against a party who shall have made a return to a
writ of mandamus, is a bar to any other action against the 
same party for the making of such return. 
SEC. 699. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed 
to any public officer, body or board, commanding the per-
forma.nce of any public duty specially enjoined by law, if 
it appear to the court that such officer, or any member of
such body or board, has, without just excuse, refused or 
neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may
impose a fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon
every such officer or member of such body or board.
Such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury
of the county where the duty ought to have been per-!
formed ; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action for
any penalty incurred by such officer or msm ber of such
body or board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to per­
form the duty so enjoined.

ment thereon ( certified by the constable or person serving 
the same to be a true copy), to the defendant, or leaving
the same at his usual place of residence. Second, An

SEC. 14. When the defendant is an incorporated insur-
ance company, and the action is brought in the county in

of fourteen years, the service must be upon him and upon 
his guardian or father ; or, if neither of these can be found, 
then upon his mother, or the person having the care or
control of the infant, or with whom he lives. If neither
of these can be found, or if the minor be more than four­
teen years of age, service on him alone shall be sufficient. 
The manner of service may be the same as in the case of
adults. 
SEc. 17. The parties are entitled to one hour in which
to appear, after the time mentioned in the summons for
appearance, or to which the case is adjourned, but are not
bound to remain longer than that time, unless both parties
have appeared, and the justice, being present, is engaged 
in the trial of another cause. In such case the justice may
postpone the time of appearance until the close of such
trial.

SEc. 18, An order for the arrest of the defendant in a
civil action shall be made by the justice of the peace

office an affidavit of the plaintiff, his authorized agent or 
attorney, made before any person authorized by law to
administer oaths, stating the nature of the plaintiff's claim,

That the defendant has removed or begun to remove any
of his property out of the county, with intent. to defraud
his creditors. Second, That the defendant has begun to
convert his property, or any part thereof, into money, for
the purpose of defrauding his creditors. Third, That he
has property or rights in action which he fraudulently
conceals. Fourth, That he has assigned, removed or dis­
posed of, or has begun to assign, remove or dispose of his
property, or any part thereof, with intent to defraud his
creditors. Fiftli,, That the defendant fraudulently con­
tracted the debt or incurred the obligation for which snit

more of the above particulars. 
SEC. 19. The order of arrest may be made to accompany'
the summons, or at any time afterwards before judgment. 
SEC. 20. The order of arrest shall not be issued by a
justice of the peace until there has been executed, by one 
or more sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, a written under-
taking, to the effect that the plaintiff shall pay to the
defendant all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the arrest, if the order be wrongfully obtained, not ex-
ceeding double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, stated 
in the affidavit. 
SEC. 21 The order of arrest shall be addressed and de- 
livered, with a copy of the affidavit, to a constable of the
proper township ; it shall state the names of the parties, 
the amount of the plaintiff's claim specified in the affida-
vit, be signed by the justice of the peace issuing it, and
shall require the constable to arrest the defendant and
bring him forthwith before said justice. 
SEc. 22. The officer receiving said order shall execute
the same by forthwith arresting the defendant and deliver-
ing to him a copy thereof, and of the affidavit ; and the
defendant so arrested, unless the claim of the plaintiff,
specified in the affidavit, and costs of suit, are paid, or un-
less discharged from custody by order of the plaintiff,
shall be taken by such constable, forthwith, before the 
justice of the peace by whom said order of arrest was
issued, and kept in custody until discharged by law. 
SEC. 23. Upon the return of said order of arrest, exe-
coted in pursuance of the preceding section, the trial of
said ca use shall proceed, unless for good ca use shown,
upon the application of either party, or at the instance of 
the justice himself', the same shall be continued, as is pro-
vided for in other cases before justices of the peace; and 
when the trial of said cause is continued for any period,
the defendant, upon executing, with one or more sufficient
sureties, a written undertaking to the effect that if judg-
ment be rendered against him upon the final determina-
tionof the action, he will render himself amenable to the
process thereon; or upon depositing in the hands of the 
justice of the peace the amount of money mentioned in 
the order of arrest, and the probable amount of costs of
suit, shall be forthwith discharged from custody. 
SEC. 24. In no case shall the defendant be detained in
the custody of the officer, when a continuance has· been
for a period of more than forty-eight hours, unless said 
continuance has been made at the instance, or with the
consent, of the defendant himself. 
SEC. 26. If the defendant, before the commencement of
the trial, file his affidavit with the justice, denying the
grounds laid in the affidavit of the plaintiff for the arrest, 
the truth of such grounds shall be considered in issue on
the trial, and shall be tried at the same time and in the
same manner as the other issues in the case ; but a separate
finding shall be made whether such grounds are "true" 
or 'i not sustained by the evidence." If all the grounds
are found to be not sustained by the evidence, the defend­
ant shall be discharged. 
SEc. 26. On judgment against the defendant, in any
civil action before a justice of the peace, when the defend-
ant is in the custody of th.e officer, as herein before provided, 
or if, after judgment against him, there is filed, in the office
of such justice, an affidavit of the plaintiff, his authorized
agent or attorney, made before any person competent to
administer an oath, stating the amount of judgment re­
maining unpaid, and one or more of the particulars men­
tioned in section eighteen, said justice of the peace shall,
unless otherwise ordered by the plaintiff, issue an execu­
tion, and accompany the same with an order for the arrest 
of the defendant. 
SEc. 27. Said order of arrest shall be addressed and
delivered, with a copy of the affidavit, to the constable hav­
ing said execution, and shall state the names of the parties,
be signed by the justice issuing it, and state the amount
of the judgment and costs unpaid, and shall require the
officer, in case the same shall not be paid, or an amount
of property of the defendant, whereon to levy execution,
sufficient to satisfy the same cannot be found in his county, 
to arrest the defendant, if not already in the custody of the
officer, and deliver him to the sheriff of the proper county, 
to be committed by him to the jail of the county, and kept
in custody until discharged by law.

SEC. 28. The plaintiff shall have an order of attachment
against the property of the defendant, in a civil action
before the justice of the peace for the recovery of money,
before or after the commencement thereof, when there is
filed in his office an affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or 
attorney, showing the nature of the plaintiff's claim, that
it is just, the amount which the affiant believes the plain· 
tiff ought to recover, and the existence of some one or
more of the following particulars: First, That the defend- 
ant is a foreign corporation, or a non-resident of the
county; or, Second, Has absconded, with intent to defraud
his creditors; or, Third, Has left the county of his resi-
dence to avoid the service of summons; or, Fourth, So
conceals himself that a summons cannot be served upon
him; or, .Fifth, Is about to remove his property, or a part 
thereof, out of the county, with the intent to defraud his
creditors; or, Sixth, Is about to convert his property, or
a part thereof, into money, for the purpose of placing it
beyond" the reach of his creditors ; or, Snenth. Has prop-
erty or rights in action which he conceals ; or, .Eighth, 
Has assigned, removed or disposed of, or is about to dis-
pose of, his property, or a part thereof, with intent to de·
fraud his creditors ; or, Ninth, Fraudulently contracted
the debt or incurred the obligation for which suit is about 
to be or has been brought. When the defendant is a for- 
eign corporation, or a non-resident of the county, the
attachment shall not be granted, unless the claim is for a
debt or demand arising upon contract, judgment or decree,
unless the cause of action arose wholly within the limits
of this state, which fact must be established on the trial. 
SEC. 29. The order of attachment shall not be issued by
the justice until there has been executed in his office, by
one or more sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, to be ap­
proved by the justice, an undertaking, not exceeding
double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, to the effect
that the plaintiff shall pay the defendant all damages
which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the 
order be wrongful1y obtained. 
SEc. 30. The order of attachment may be made to ac­
company the summons, or at any time afterward before
judgment; it shall be addressed and delivered to any
constable of the proper township, and shall require him 
to attach the goods, chattels, stocks or interest in stocks,
rights, credits, moneys and effects of the defendant in his
county, not exempt by law from being applied to the pay­
ment of the plaintiff's claim, or so much thereof as will
satisfy the plaintiff's claim, to be stated in the order asin
the affidavit, and the probable costs of the action, not
exceeding fifty dollars. 
SEC. 31. The return day of the order of attachment,
when issued at the commencement of the action, shall be
the same as that of the summons ; when issued afterwards,
it shall be executed and returned forthwith. 
SEc. 32. When there are several orders of attachment
against the same defendant, in the hands of the same offi­
cer, they shall be executed in the order in which they 
were received by said officer. He shall go to the place
where the defendant's property may be found, and there,
in the presence of two credible persons, declare that by 
virtue of said order, he attaches said property at the suit
of such plaintiff; and the officer, with two householders
of the county, who shall be first sworn or affirmed by the
officer, shall make a true inventory and appraisement of
all property attached, which shall be signed by the officer
and said householders, and returned with the order ; when
the property can be come at, he shall take the same into
his custody, and hold it subject to the order of the justice. 
SEc. 33. The constable shall deliver the property at­
tached to the person in whose possession it was found, 
upon the execution by such person, in the presence of the
constable, of an undertaking to the plaintiff, with one or
more sufficient sureties, resident in the county, to the effect
that the parties to the same are bound in double the
appraised value thereof, that the property or its appraised
value in money shall be forthcoming to answer the judg- 
ment of the court in the action ; but if. it shall appear to 
the court that any part of said property has been lost or
destroyed by unavoidable accident, the value thereof shall 
be remitted to the person or persons so found.
SEc. 34. Different attachments of the same property 
may be made, and one inventory and appraisement shall
be sufficient. The lien of the attachments shall be in the
order in which they are served, and the subsequent
attachments shall be served on the property as in the
hands of the officer, and subject to the prior attachments.
The justice who issued the attachment having the priority
of lien, shall determine all questions as to the priority of
liens on the property attached. 
SEC. 35. If the order of attachment is made to accompany
the summons, a copy thereof and the summons shall be
served upon the defendant in the usual manner for the 
service of summons, if the same can be done within the
county ; and when any property of the defendant has been 
taken under the order of attachment, and it shall appear"
that the summons issued in the action has not been. and 
cannot be served on the defendant in the county, in the
manner prescribed by law, the justice of the peace shall 
continue the cause for a period not less than thirty or more
than fifty days ; whereupon the plaintiff shall proceed, for 
three consecutive weeks, to publish, in some newspaper
printed in the county, or, if none be printed therein, then
in some newspaper of general circulation in said county,
a notice, stating the names of the parties, the time when,
by what justice of the peace, and for what sum said order
was issued and the time when the cause will be heard,
and shall make proof of such publication to the justice ;
and thereupon said action shall be proceeded with the
same as if said summons had been duly served. 
SEC. 36. When the cause is continued, as provided for
in the preceding section, and it shall appear that any of 
the property taken under the attachment is live stock, or
is of a perishable nature, the justice may issue his order 
directing the officer having custody thereof, to dispose of 
the same as upon execution; and the moneys realized
therefrom shall be paid over to the justice, and applied as
other money realized from the sale of the property attached 
is applied.
SEc. 37. When the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall 
make oath, in writing, that he has good reason to and
does believe that any person or corporation, to be named, 
and within the county where the action is brought, has
property of the defendant (describing the same), or credits
in his possession, or is indebted to him, if the officer cannot
come at the property, he shall leave with such garnishee
a copy of the order of attachment, with a written notice
that he appear before the justice, at the return of the
order of attachment, and answer, as provided in section 
thirty-nine.
SEC. 38. The copy of the order and notice shall be 
served upon the garnishee as follows : If he be a person,
they shall be served upon him personally, or left at his
usual place of residence ; if a corporation, they shall be 
left with the president or other head of the same, or the
secretary, cashier or managing agent thereof. 
SEC. 39. The garnishee shall appear before the justice,
in accordance with the command of the notice, and shall
answer, under oath, all questions put to him touching the
property of every description and credits of the defendant,
in his possession or under his control ; and h.e shall disclose
truly the amount owing by him to the defendant, whether
due or not ; and in the case of a corporation, any stock
therein held by or for the benefit of the defendant, at or
after the service of the notice. The examination of the
garnishee, with the questions and answers, shall be re­
duced to writing by the justice, or in his presence signed
by the party and filed, unless the parties otherwise agree. 
SEC. 40. A garnishee may pay the money owing to the
defendant by him, to the constable having the order of
attachment, or into court. He shall be discharged from 
liability to the defendant for any money so paid, not
exceeding the plaintiff's claim. He shall not be subject
to costs beyond those caused by his resistance of the claim
against him, and if he disclose the property in his hands,
or the true amount owing by him, and deliver or pay the
same according to the order of the court, he shall be
allowed his costs. 
SEC. 41. If the garnishee do not appear and answer, as 
required by section thirty-nine, the justice may proceed
against him by attachment, as for a contempt. 
SEc. 42. If the garnishee appear and answer, and it is
discovered on his examination that at or after the service 
of the order of attachment and notice upon him, he was
possessed of any property of the defendant, or was
indebted to him, the justice may order the delivery of
such property, and the payment of the amount owing by
the garnishee into court, or may permit the garnishee to 
retain the property or the amount owing, upon the execu­
tion of an undertaking to the plaintiff, by one or more
sufficient sureties, to the effect that the amount shall be
paid or the property forthcoming, as the court may direct. 
SEC. 43. If the garnishee fails to appear and answer, or 
if he appears and answers, and his disclosure is not satis-
factory to the plaintiff, or if he fails to comply with the 
order of the justice to deliver the property and pay the
money owing into court, or give the undertaking required
in the preceding section, the plaintiff may proceed against
him in an action, in his own name, as in other cases ; and 
thereupon such proceedings may be had as in other actions,
and judgment may be rendered in favor of the splaintiff
for the amount of the property and credits of every kind,
of the defendant in the possession of the garnishee, and for
what shall appear to be owing by him to the defendant,
and for the costs of the proceedings against the garnishee.
If the plaintiff proceed against the garnishee by action,
for the cause that his disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless 
it appears in the action that such disclosure was incom­
plete, the plaintiff shall pay the costs of such action. The 
judgment in this action may be enforced as Judgments in
other cases. When the claims of the plaintiffs in attach­
ment are satisfied by the garnishee, he may, on motion, be
substituted as the plaintiff in the judgment.  ; 
SEC. 44. The plaintiff may give notice to the J"usi·~-ffl; 
the answer of the garnishee is unsatisfactery, and ~nd
a trial of the trntp of' such answer, and the justi~~lfJJ.
thereupon appoint a day for such trial, which shall be rr 
ducted, in all respects, as in other cases. 
SEC. 45. Final .. dg ment shall not be rendered azainst 
the garnishee until the action against the defendant in at-
tachment has been determined ; and if, in such action, 
judgment be rendered for the defendant in attachment, the
garnishee shall be discharged, and recover costs. If the 
plaintiff shall recover against the defendant in attach­
ment, and the garnishee shall deliver up all property, 
moneys and credits of the defendant in his possession, and
pay all the moneys from him due, as the court may order, 
the garnishee shall be discharged, and the costs of the pro­
ceedings against him shall be paid out of the property and
moneys so surrendered, or as the court may think right 
and proper.
SEC. 46. If judgment be rendered, in the action, for the 
defendant, the attachment shall be discharged, and the
property attached, or its proceeds, shall be returned to 
him.
SEC. 47. If judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall 
be satisfied as follows : So much of the property remain­
ing in the hands of the officers, after applying the moneys
arising from the sale of perishable property, and so much
of the personal property, if any, as may be necessary to 
satisfy the judgment, shall be sold, by order of the justice,
under the same restrictions and regulations as if the same
had been levied on by execution ; and the money arising
therefrom, with the amount which may be recovered from
the gan:Ashee, shall be applied to satisfy the judgment
and costs. If there be not enough to satisfy the same, the
judgment shall stand, and execution may issue thereon
for the residue, in all respects as in other cases. Any sur­
plus of the attached . property, or its proceeds, shall be
returned to the defendant. 
SEC. 48. The justice may order the constable to repos­
sess himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the at­
tached property which may have passed out of his hands
without having been sold or converted into money; and the
constable shall, under such order, have the same power to 
Ufte the property as he would have under an order of attachment.
SEC. 49. Where several attachments are executed on the
Ett.W\1"operty, ~ the same persons are made garnishees, 
,.y of the plainti:l's, may determine the amounts and pri­
orities of the several attachments, and the proceeds shall 
t:lfe Justice issuing the first order served, on the n!otion of 
be applied accordingly. 
SEc. 50. The officer shall return, upon every order of 
attachment, what he has done under it. The return must
show the property attached, and the time it was attached.
When garnishees are a,rved, their names, and the time 
each was served, must be stated. The officer shall also
return, with the order, all undertakings given under it. 
SEc. 51. An order of attachment ~inds the property at- 
tached from the time of service, and tl!e garnishee shall
stand liable to the plaintiff in attachment for all property,
moneys and credits in his hands, or due from him to the
defendant, from the time he is served with the written
notice mentioned in section thirty-s~ven; but when prop-
erty is att,,ched in the hands of a consignee or other person 
hiving attl'>r lien, his lien thereon shall not be affected
by the attachment. 
SEC. 52. If the defendant, or other person in his behalf,
at any time before judgment, cause an undertaking to be 
executed to theplaintiff by one or more sureties, resident
in the county, to be approved by tfie justice, in double the
amount of the plaintiff's claim, to be stated in his affidavit, 
to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment
of the justice, the attachment in such action shall be dis-
charged, and restitution made of any property taken
under it, or the proceeds thereof. Such undertaking shall
also discharge the liability of a garnishee, in such action,
for any property of the defendant in his hands. 
SEc. 53. If the defendant shall, before the trial is com-
menced, file an affidavit, denying the grounds laid for the
attachment in the plaintiff's affidavit, the justice shall, on/\,~/-,/,
reasonable notice, in writing, being given to the opposite
party, proceed to examine i. the truth of the grounds
laid for such attachment, and shall hear such evidence as
may be produced by either party; and if it appear that
such grounds are not sustained by the evidence, the jus-
tice shall discharge the attachment. 
SEC. 54. If, in any case where an order of attachment
has been issued by a justice of the peace, it shall appear 
from the return of the officer and from the examination of
the garnishee, that no property, moneys, rights, credits or 
effects of the defendant has been taken under the attach-
ment, but that the defendant is the owner of an interest in
real estate in the county, the justice before whom such 
action is pending shall, at the request of the plaintiff,
forthwith certify his proceedings to the dlMrict court of
the proper county ; and thereupon the clerk of said court
shall docket said cause, and the action shall be proceeded
with in said court in all respects as if the same had 
originated therein.

SEC. 55. Justices of the peace shall have jurisdiction of actions for the recovery of specific personal property not exceeding three hundred dollars in value, as herein provided.
SEC. 55. An action for this purpose shall not be brought
until there is filed in the office of the justice an affidavit
of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, showing: First, A 
description of the property claimed. Second, "I'hat the
plaintiff is the owner thereof', or has a special ownership
therein, stating the facts in relation thereto, and that he· is 
entitled to the immediate possession of the property.
Third, That the property is wrongfully detained by the 
defendant. Fourth, That i~,is not taken in execution on
any order or judgment agai~t said plaintiff: or if so taken
on execution, that it is by statute exempt from seizure, or
for the payment of any tax, fine or nmercement assessed
against him, or by virtue of an order of delivery issued
under this article, or any other mesne or final process
issued against said plaintiff; and, Fifth, The actual value
of the property. When several articles are claimed, the
value of each article shall be stated as nearly as practica­
ble. 
SEC. 57. The justice shall not issue a summons as here­
inafter provided, until there has been executed in his office, 
by one or more sufficient sureties of' the plaintiff', to be
approved by the justice, an undertaking in not less than
double the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit,
to the effect that the plaintiff shall dnly prosecute the
action, and pay. all costs and damngvs which may be 
awarded against him; and if the pr~1Jerty be delivered to 
him that he will return the same to the defendant, if a re­
turn thereof be adjudged. 
SEc. 58. Upon such affidavit and undertaking being
executed and filed with the justice, he shall issue a sum- 
mons as in other cases, but in addition commanding the
constable immediately to seize and take into his custody,
wherever they may be found in the county, the goods and
chattels mentioned in the affidavit, and deliver the same
to the plain tiff. 
SEC. 59. The constable shall execute the writ by taking
the property therein mentioned. · He shall also deliver a 
copy of the summons to the persons charged with the un-
lawful detention of property, or leave such a copy at his
usual place of residence, and shall make return of the
time and manner of service, and any undertaking taken 
by him. 
SEc. 60. If, within twenty-four hours after service of the
copy of the summons, there is executed, by one or more 
sufficient sureties of the defendant, to be approved by the
constable, an undertaking to the plaintiff, in not less than
double the amount of the value of the property, as stated
in the affidavit of the plaintiff, to the effect that the defend-
ant will deliver the property to the plaintiff if such delivery
be adjudged, and will pay all costs and damages that may 
be awarded against him, the constable shall return the
property to the defendant, If such undertaking be not 
given within twenty-four hours after the service of the or-
der, the constable shall deliver the property to the plaintiff. 
SEC. 61. The plaintiff may, within twenty-four hours 
- 
· from the time the undertaking mentioned in the preceding section is given by the defendant, give notice to the con­
stable that he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If 
he fails to do so, Im must be deemed to have waived all
objections to them. When the plaintiff excepts, the sure­
ties must justify, upon notice, as bail on arrest. The 
constable shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the 
sureties until the ob} .. ction to them is waived, as above
provided, or until they justify. 
SEc. 62. The affidavit of the plaintiff, as to the value of 
the property, shall fix the jurisdiction of the justice so tar
as such value is concerned; but the value of the property 
shall not be assessed against the defendant at a greater
amount than that sworn to by the plaintiff in his affidavit, 
SEc. 63. If tho property has been delivered to the plain- 
tiff, and he fails to prosecute his action to final judgment,
the justice shall, upon the application of the defendant or 
his attorney, impannel a jury to inquire into the right of
property, and the right of possession of the defendant to 
the property taken. If the jury shall be satisfied that the
said property was the property of the defendant at the
commencement of the action, or if the said jury be satis­
fied that the defendant was entitled to the possession at
such time, they shall find accordingly, and shall further
find the value of such property, or the value of the pos­
session thereof, and any damages for withholding the same
as may be just and proper. 
SEC. 64. In all cases when the property has been deliv-
ered to the plaintiff, when the jury shall find for the de­ 
fendant, they shall also find whether the defendant had the
right of property, or the right of possession only, at the
commencement of the suit, and, if they find either in his
favor, they shall also find the value of the property, or the
value of the possession, and such damages for withholding
said property as may be just and proper. 
SEC. 65. The judgment, in the cases mentioned in the
two preceding sections, shall be for the return of the prop- 
erty, or the value thereof,. or the value of the possession
of the same, in case a return cannot be had, and the costs 
of the suit. 
SEc. 66. In all cases when the property bas been deliv­
ered to the plaintiff, where the jury shall find for the 
plaintiff on the trial, or on inquiry of damages, they shall
assess adequate damages to the plaintiff for the illegal de­
tention of the property, for which, with costs of suit, the
justice shall render judgment against the defendant. 
SEC. 67. When the property claimed has not been taken,
the action may proceed as one for damages only, and the
plaintiff shall be entitled to such damages as may be right
and proper. 
SEC. 68. The constable, in executinz the writ, may break 
open any building or inclosure in which the property
claimed, or any part thereof, is concealed; but not until
he has been refused an entrance into said building or in­ 
closure, and the delivery of the property, after having de­
manded the same. 
SEC. 60. Whenever it shall be made to appear to the
satisfaction of the justice, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, 
or otherwise, that the defendant, or any other person, 
knowingly conceals the property sought to be recovered,
or, having 'Control thereof, refuses to deliver the same to 
the officer, the justice may commit such defendant, or other
person, until he or they disclose where such property is, 
or deliver the same to the officer. 
SEC. 70. If any justice shall issue a writ to replevin
property, as is provi e by t is act, without the affidavit
and undertaking being executed and filed in his office, as 
is provided in this article, the same shall be set aside at
his costs, and he shall be liable, in damages, to the party 
injured.

SEc. 83. If either party fail to appear at the time speci-
fled in the summons, or within one hour thereafter, or fail

all cases where a counter-claim or set-off has been filed
before the dismissal of the cause by the plaintiff, the
defendant shall have the right to proceed with the trial of
his claim. 
SEc. 84. In no case shall it be necessary to prove the
execution of any written instrument upon which the action
or counter-claim or set-off is founded, or any indorsement

posite party shall file an affidavit denying the execution of
such instrument, or the making of such indorsement, or the 
existence of such partnership.

before a justice, an action, of which such justice has cog-
nizance, the justice shall enter the same on his docket and 
proceed to trial, judgment and execution, in all respects
in the same manner as if summons had been issued, served
and returned. 
SEC. 95. In all civil actions, after an appearance of the
defendant, and before the justice shall proceed to inquire
into the merits of the cause, either party may demand a
jury to try the action, which jury shall be composed of

jurors in the district court, unless the parties shall agree
on a less number. 
SEc. 96. When a jury is demanded, the trial of the case
must be adjourned until a time fixed for the return of the

--- o· clock in the noon, to serve as jurors in a
case pending before me, then and there to be tried, and

there this writ, with your doings thereon. Given under
my hand this day of , A. D. A. B.,
justice of the peace." 
SEc. 99. The constable shall serve such summons by a 
personal service thereof, and return the same indorsed
with the names of the persons summoned, at the time 
appointed for the trial of the cause. 
SEc. 100. Jurors, for noglvcting or refusing to nttend 
when properly summoned, or refusing to serve when in 
Google 
attendance, shall be liable to a like penalty, and be pro­
ceeded against in the same manner, as witnesses who fail
to attend or refuse to testify. 
SEc. 101. The constable shall be in attendance on the
court, at and during the progres::; of the trial ; and if. from
challenge or other cause, the panel shall not be full, he

cause shall be continued, the jurors must attend at the
time and place appointed for the trial, without further
notice.

party, instruct the jury upon any point of law arising in
the case ; but such instructions shall be reduced to writing
before they are given, and shall be filed among the papers
in the case. 
SEc. 107. After the Jury shall have been sworn, they
shall sit together and hear the proofs and allegations of
the parties, and, after hearing the same, shall be. kept
together in some convenient place, under the charge of a
constable, until they have agreed upon their verdict or 
shall be discharged by the justice. 
SEC. 108. When the jurors shall have agreed upon their
verdict, they shall deliver it to the justice publicly, who
shall enter it upon his docket. 
SEc. 109. Whenever the justice shall be satisfied that a
jury, sworn in any cause before him, cannot agree on their 
verdict, after having consulted upon it a reasonable time,
he may discharge them and continue the cause, and may,
if required by either party, proceed to strike another 
jury as herein before provided. The cause shall be con­
t inned until such time as the justice thinks reasonable,
unless the parties or their attorneys agree on a longer or 
shorter time, or unless they agree that the justice may
render judgment on the evidence already heard before
him. 
SEc. 110. It shall be lawful for the justice, before whom 
a cause has been tried, on motion, and being satisfied that
the verdict was obtained by fraud, partiality or undue
means, at any time within four days after the entering of
judgment, to grant a new trial; and he shall set a time
for the new trial, of which the opposite party shall have

question of law arising during the trial of the cause ; and
when either party shall allege such exception, it shall be 
the duty of the justice to allow and sign a bill containing
such exception, if truly alleged, with the point decided,
so that the same may be made part of the record in the 
cause. .

against a defendant, 1n his absence, the same may be set 
aside upon the following conditions: First, That his motion
· be made within ten days after such judgment was entered. 
Second, That he pays or confesses judgment for the costs
awarded against him. Third, That he file an affidavit

part, of the plaintiff's claim. Fourth, That he notifies, in
writing, the opposite party, his agent or attorney, or
causes it to be done, of the opening of such judgment,
and of the time and place of trial, at least five days before

not a resident of the county, by leaving a written notice
thereof at the office of the justice, ten days before the trial. 
SEC. 115. Upon a verdict, the justice must immediately
render judgment accordingly. ,vhen the trial is by the 
justice, judgment must be entered immediately after the
close of the trial, if the defendant has been arrested, or his 
· property attached ; in other cases, it must be entered either
at the close of the trial, or, if the justice then desires fur·
ther time to consider, on or by the fourth day thereafter,
both days inclusive. 
SEC. 116. When the amount due to either party exceeds
the sum for which the justice is authorized to enter judg- 
ment, such party may remit the excess, and judgment
may be entered for the residue. A defendant need not re· 
mit such excess, and may withhold setting the same off;
and a recovery for the amount set off and allowed, or any
part thereof, shall not be a bar to his subsequent action for
the amount withheld. 
SEC. 117. If the defendant, any time before trial, offers,
in writing, to allow judgment to be taken against him for 
a specified sum, the plaintiff may immediately have judg-
ment therefor, with the costs then accrued ; but if he do
not accept such offer before the trial, and fails to recover,
in the action, a sum equal to the offer, he cannot recover
costs accrued after the offer, but costs must be adjudged 
against him ; but the offer, and failure to accept it, cannot
be given in evidence or mentioned on the trial. 
SEc. 118. When judgment is rendered in a case where
the defendant is subject to varrest and imprisonment, it

court may, with the consent of such appellee, dismiss the 
appeal at the cost of the appellant, and remand the cause 
to the justice of the peace, to be thereafter proceeded in
as if no appeal had been taken. 
SEC. 126. If the plaintiff in the action before the justice
shall appeal from any judgment rendered against such
plaintiff, and after having filed his transcript, and caused
such appeal to be docketed, according to the provisions of
this act, shall fail to file a petition, or otherwise neglect to
prosecute the same to final judgment, so that such plaintiff 
shall become non-suit, it shall be the duty of the court to 
render judgment against such appellant, for the amount
of the judgment rendered against him by the justice of
the peace, together with the interest accrued thereon, and
for costs of suit, and to award execution therefor as in
other cases. 
SEC. 127. If both parties fail to enter such appeal within
th~ time limited, as aforesaid, the justice, on receiving a 
certificate from the clerk of the court, stating that the ap­
peal was not entered, or, being entered, was dismissed as
aforesaid, shall thereupon issue execution upon the judg­
ment, in the same manner as if such appeal had never been
taken. 
SEC. 128. If any person, appealing from a judgment
rendered in his favor, shall not recover a greater sum than

judgment shall be entered in the district court against the 
appellant, the surety in the undertaking shall be liable to

be stated in the order of the court, and a transcript of such
order shall be filed with such justice, who shall thereupon
proceed to issue execution, in the same manner as if no
appeal had been taken. 
SEC. 131. In proceedings on appeal, when the surety in
the undertaking shall be insufficient, or such undertaking 
may be insufficient in form or amount, it shall be lawful
for the court, on motion, to order a change or renewal of 
such undertaking, and direct that the same be certified to
the justice from whose judgment the appeal was taken, or
that it be filed in said court.

collect the amount of the judgment out of the personal
property of the debtor, and pay the same to the party
entitled thereto. Second, If it be a case where any of the 
judgment debtors are certified on the docket as surety, it
shall command that the money be made of the personal
property of the principal debtor, and, for want thereof,

within the jurisdiction, shall be exhausted before any of
the property of the surety shall be taken in execution.

cient property of the defendant, subject to the execution,

the thirty days.

days to elapse without making a return thereof to the

constable guilty of such neglect shall forfeit and pay, on
conviction thereof, any sum not exceeding one hundred
dollars, to be recovered by action in the name of the state

ders, or other just cause, it shall be his duty to return

immediately thereafter issue an order, thereby command-
ing any constable to whom the same may be directed or 
delivered, to expose such property to sale ; which sale and

erty had been sold on the original execution.

chattels, of which he permits the party against whom the
execution issued to retain the possession, is hereby au-
thorized to take such security for his own indemnity as

landlord or tenant, against whom such process was not
issued, shall not be affected thereby; but the same may be 
sold, subject to the claim or interest of- the landlord or
tenant against whom such process did not issue. 
SEC. 154. In cases where the constable shall make it
appear, to the satisfaction of the justice, that he has been 
deprived of an opportunity of levying an execution within
the time prescribed by this act, or otherwise prevented 
from making the whole of the money therein required to
be made, and shall make return to the justice who issued
the same to that effect, such justice is hereby authorized
and required to issue further process of execution for the
amount or balance remaining unsatisfied, which shall be
served and returned in all respects as other executions are
under this act. 
SEc. 155. When an execution issued by a justice of the
peace shall have been returned unsatisfied, the judgment
creditor, his agent or attorney, may file an affidavit with
the justice, setting forth that he has good reason to and
does believe that any person or corporation, to be named,

an order to such garnishee to appear before him, on a day
to be named, and answer such questions as may be pro­
pounded to Mm by the judgment creditor touching the 
property of the ,j ndgment debtor in his possession or under

debtor, whether due or not.

prisonment, or both ; such fine not to exceed twenty
dollars, and such imprisonment ten days.
