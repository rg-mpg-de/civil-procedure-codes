Publication,
(lrder for:
Se~tioo 319:1. Service by Poblieatioo, Order for: 
When the person on whom the service i's to be made resides out of the
State, or has departed from the State, or cannot, after due diligence,
be found within the State, or conceals himself to avoid the service
of summons, or is a foreign corporation having no managing or busi­
ness agent, cashier, or secretary within the State, and the fact appears
by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court or a judge thereof, or a pro­
bate judge, and it also appears by such affidavit, or by the verified com­
plaint on file that a cause of action exists against the defendant in re­
spect to whom the service is to be made, or that he is a necessary or
proper party to the action, such court or judge may make an order that
the service be made by the publication of the summons. 

Section 3196. SerYice by Poblicatioa, Bow· .Mad~:
The order must direct the publication to be made in a newspaper to
~ .. e designated as most likely to give notice to the person to be served,
and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, at least
once a week; but publication against a defendant residing out of the
state or absent therefrom. must not be less than one month. In case
of publication, where the residence of a non-resident or absent de­
fendant is known, the court or judge must direct a copy of the sum­
mons and complaint to be forthwith deposited in the post office. di­
rected to the person to be served at his place of residence. When
publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and
complaint out of the state, is equivalent to publication and deposit in
the postoffice; and in either case the service of the summons is com­ 
plete at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publi­
cation.

pearance•: From the time of the service of the summons and of
a copy of a complaint in a civil action, where service of a copy of
the complaint is required, or of the completion of the publication,
when service by publication is ordered, the court is deemed to have
acquired jurisdiction of the parties and to have control of all the
subsequent proceedings. The voluntary appearance of a defendant
is equivalent to personal service of the summons and copy of the
complaint upon him.

ing to the information and belief of the defendant. If the defendant
has no information or belief upon the subject sufficient to enable him
to answer an a11egation of the complaint, he may so state in his ans­
wer, and place his denial on that ground. If the complaint be not
verified a general denial is sufficient, but only puts in issue the ma- 
terial allegations of the complaint.

Section 33'17. Juriwdiction. Procedure. "Notice to
Pre8ee11ting Attorney: The district courts of the several ju­
dicial districts of this State shall have jurisdiction of actions for di­
vorce under the provisions of Section 2028 of the Civil Code, and
such action shall be brought in the county of this State in which
the plainciff resides. A nd the court in which such action is about to be

verified showing that a cause of action exists under this Chapter.
appoint some person to act as guardian of such insane person in such
action. and the summons and the complaint in such action shall be

no divorce shall be granted under the provisions of this Chapter ex­
cept in the presence of the county attorney.

There can be but one action for the recovery of any debt. or the en­
forcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real estate or per­
sonal property, which action must be in accordance with the provis­
ions of this Chapter. In such action the court may, by its judgment.
direct a sale of the incumbered property ( or so much thereof as may be
necessary) and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the pay-
ment of the costs of the court and the expenses of the sale, and the
amount due to the plaintiff; and sales of real estate under judgment of
foreclosure of mortgages and liens are subject to redemption as in
the case of sales under execution; and if it appear from the sheriff's
return that the proceeds are insufficient, and a balance still remains
due, judgment can then be docketed for such balance against the de­
fendant or defendants personalty liable for the debt, and it becomes
a lien on the real estate of such judgment debtor. as in other cases on
which execution may be issued. No person holding a conveyance
from or under the mortgagor of the property mortgaged, or having
a lien thereon, which conveyance or lien does not appear. of record
in the proper office at the commencement of the action, need be made
a party to such action ; and the judgment therein rendered, and the
proceedings therein had, are as conclusive against the party holding
such unrecorded conveyance or lien as if he had been made a party to 
the action.

Section 3333. Preceeding• when Debt Necured Fall•
Due at Difrerent Thnet1: l f the debt for which the mortgage,
lien or incumbrance is held is not all due, so soon as sufficient of the
property has been sold to pay the amount due. with costs, the sale
must cease; and afterwards, as often as more becomes due, for prin­
cipal or interest. the court may. on motion. order more to be sold.
But if the property cannot be sold in portions. without injury to the
parties. the whole may be ordered to be sold in the first instance, and
the entire debt and costs paid, there being a rebate of interest where
such rebate is proper. 

Section 88:14. A. Mortl'Al'e 1'1oet not be Deemed a
CoaYeyaoce: A mortgage. of real property shall not be deemed a 
conveyance, whatever its terms, so as to enable the owner of the

and file the same with the justice or judge. The statement must
contain the grounds upon which the party intends to rely on the
appeal, and so much of the evidence as may be necessary to explain the
grounds and no more. With ten days after he receives notice that
the statement is filed, the adverse party if dissatisfied with the same,

be settled by the justice or judge, and if no amendment be filed, the

appeal before the district court.

tions of both law and fact, no statement need be made, but the
action be tried anew in the district court.

the fees of the court or justice and filing an undertaking as required

any, the clerk or justice must, within five days, transmit to the clerk
of the district court. if the appeal be on questions of law alone, the
pleadings and files in the action. a certified copy of his docket, the
statement, if any, as admitted or as settled, the notice of appeal 
and the undertaking filed; or, if the appeal be on questions of fact,
or both law and fact, a certified copy of his docket, the pleadings, all
notices, motions, and other papers filed in the cause, the notice of ap­
peal and the undertaking filed and the justice or judge may be com­
pelled by the district court, by an order entered upon motion, to trans­ 
mit such papers, and may be fined for neglect or refusal to trans.
mit the same. A certified copy of such order may be served on the jus­
tice or judge by the party or his attorney. In the district court, either
party may have the benefit of all legal objections made in probate or
justices' courts. And the district court has the same power to grant
relief by amendment and otherwise, as in actions commenced in the 
district court. 

Section 3887. 1Jodertalda~ on A.ppeal, Ju•tiftca1ioo 
oC Suretin: An appeal from a justice's or probate court is not
effectual for any purpose, unless an undertaking be filed, with two or
more sureties, in the SUllJ of one hundred dollars, for the payment of
the costs on the appeal; or, if a stay of proceedings be claimed, in 1. 
sum equal to twice the amonut of the judgment, including costs,
when the judgment is for the payment of money; or twice the value
of the property, including costs, when the judgment is for the re­
covery of specific personal property, and must be conditioned, when
the action is for the recovery of money, that the appellant will pay
the amount of the judgment appealed from and all costs, if the ap­
peal be withdrawn or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment, and
all costs that may be recovered against him in the action in the dis­
trict court. \Vhen the action is for the recovery of specific personal
property, the undertaking must be conditioned that the appellant
will pay the judgment and costs appealed from, and obey the order
of the court made therein, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed,
or any judgment and costs that may be recovered against him in said
action in the district court, and will obey any order made by the
court therein. When the judgment appealed from directs the deliv­
ery of possession of real property, the execution of the same can­
not be stayed unless a written undertaking be executed on the part
of the appellant. with two or more sureties, to the effect that during
the possession of such property by the appellant, he will not com­
mit or suffer to be committed, any waste thereon, and that if the
appeal be dismissed or withdrawn, or the judgment affirmed, • or
judgment be recovered against him in the action in the district court.
he will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property from
the time of the appeal until the delivery of possession thereof; or that 
he will pay any judgment and costs that may be recovered against
him in said action in the district court, not exceeding the sum to he 
fixed by the judge or justice of the court from which the appeal is tak­
en, and which sum must be specified in the undertaking. A deposit
of the amount of the judgment. including all costs appealed from, or
of the value of the property including all costs in actions for the re­
covery of specific personal property, with the justice or judge. is
equivalent to the filing of the undertaking; and in such cases the jus­
tice or judge must transmit the money to the clerk of the district court,
to be by him paid out on the order of the court. The adverse party
may except to the sufficiency of the sureties within five days after
the filing of the undertaking, and unless they or other sureties jus­ 
tify before the justice or judge from whom the appeal is taken. with­
in five days thereafter. upon notice to the adverse party. to the
amounts stated in their affidavits, the appeal must he regarded as if no
such undertaking had been given. 

Section 3888. On Fllln1r 1Jndertaktn.-~ Eieeotl••
Stayed: If an execution he issued. on the filing- of the undertaking 
staying proceedings. the iustice or judge must. by order. direct the
officer to stay all proceedings on the same. Such officer must. upon
payment of his fees for services rendered on the execution. thereupon
relinquish all property levied upon and deliver the same to the judg­
ment debtor, together with all moneys collected from sales or other­

A discharge duly granted under this chapter, with the exceptions
aforesaid, releases the debtor from all claims, debts, liabilities and de­
mands set forth in his schedule, or which were or might have been
proved against his estate in insolvency, and may be pleaded by a
simple averment that on the day of its date such discharge was
granted to him, setting forth the same in full, and the same is a com­
plete bar to all suits brought on any such debts, claims, liabilities or
demands, and the certificate is prima facie evidence in favor of such
fact, and of the regularity of such discharge: Provided, however, 
That any creditor of said debtor whose debt was proved, or provable,
against the estate in insolvency, who sees fit to contest the validity
of such discharge on the ground that it was fraudulently obtained,
and who has discovered the facts constituting the fraud subsequent to
the discharge, may, at any time within two years after the date

may proYe their respective debts; and the assignee must he chosen
hy the creditors of the co-partnership. and must keep separate ac- 
counts of the joint stock or property of the co-partnership, and of the
separate estate of each member thereof; and after deducting out of
the whole amount received by such assignee the whole amount of
the expenses and disbursements, the net proceeds of the joint stock
must be appropriated to pay the creditors of the co-partnership, and
the net proceeds of the separate estate of each partner must be appro­
priated to pay his separate creditors; and if there is any balance
of the separate estate of any partner after the payment of his
separate debts, such balance must be added to the joint stock for the
payment of the joint creditors, and if there is any balance of the joint
stock after the payment of the joint debts, such balance must be di­
vided and appropriated to and among the separate estate of the sev­ 
eral partners according to their respective rights and interest therein,
as it would have been if the partnership had been dissolved
without insolvency; and the sum so appropriated to the separate
estate of each partner must be applied to the payment of his separate
debts, and the certificate of discharge must be granted or refused to
each partner as the same would or ought to be if the proceedings had
been by him alone under this Chapter; and in all other respects the pro
ceedings as to partners must be conducted in the like manner as if
they had been commenced and prosecuted by or against one person
alone. 
If such co-partners reside in different counties, that court in which
· the petition is first filed may retain exclusive jurisdiction over the 
case. If the petition be filed by less than all the partners of a co­

Section 4188. But one Petition, Order, and Sale had,

and debts, there need be but one petition filed, but one order of sale
made, and but one sale had, except in the case of perishable prop­
erty, which may be sold as provded in the next section. The pro­
bate court, when a petition for the sale of any property, for any of
the purposes herein named, is presented, must inquire fully into the
probable amount required to make all such payments, and if there
be no more estate than sufficent to pay the same, may require but
one proceeding for the sale of the entire estate. In such case the
petition must set forth substantially the facts required in a petition

allowance made to the family of the decedent. The order for the

personal property as may be necessary therefor. Upon filing his peti­
tion, notice of at least five days must be given of the hearng of the
application, either by posting notices or by advertising. He may
also make a similar application, either in vacation or term, from
time to time, so long as any personal property remains in his hands
and sale thereof is necessary. If it is made to appear for the best
interests of the estate, he may at any time after filing the inventory,
in like manner and after giving like· notice, apply for and obtain an
order to sell the whole of the personal property belonging to the
estate, whether necessary to pay debts or not.

nership interest, whether made to the surviving partner or to any
other person, the court or judge must carefully inquire into the con­
dition of the partnership affairs, and must examine the surviving
partner if in the county and able to be present in court,

If it appears that a sale is necessary for the payment of debts or the
family allowance. or for the best interest of the estate and the per­
sons interested in the property to be sold, whether it is or is not
necessary to pay the debts or family allowance, the court or judge
must order it to be made. ln making orders and sales for the pay­
ment of debts or family allowance, the court or judge must so direct;
and such articles as are not necessary for the support and subsistarrce
of the family of the decedent, or are not specially bequeathed, must be

allowance, until alf other personal estate has been applied to the pay­
ment thereof.

lic notice, given for at least ten days, by notices posted in three public
places in the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both. con­

this State, but had mining interests herein, the probate court of any:
county in this State, in which such mining interests are situated,

any of his co-owners or mining partners in any of said mining inter­
ests, or of any person having any interest in such mining properties.
or in the estate, appoint an administrator, who shall give bonds as
required by the court; that the probate court first acquiring jurisdic­
tion has exclusive jurisdiction of the administration of all of deced­
ent's mining interests in this State, and that after such appointment
of an administrator of such non-resident decedent, creditors may pre­
sent and prove their claims as in other cases, but within such time
as the court may order. 
The probate court may, when it shall appear that the decedent
has no creditors in this State, or, when for other cause it shall seem
best to the court, permit decedent's foreign administrator or repre­
sentative to file certified copies of his letters or authority to represent
the estate, and thereafter he has all the authority of an administrator
appoined under the laws of this State.

granted to the executor or administrator to sell such mines, mining
interests, shares, or stocks, as are set forth in the petition and belong·
ing to the estate. A copy of the order to show cause must be per­
sonally served on all persons interested in the estate. at least ten days

Section 4189. Hearing and Order oC !!iale; If, upon
hearing the petition it appears to the satisfaction of the probate judge 
that it is to the interest of such estate that such mining property
or interests of the estate should be sold, or if it appears to his satis­
faction that an immediate sale is necessary in order to secure the just
rights or interests of the mining partner, or tenants in common, such
probate judge must make an order authorizing such administrator or
other legal representative to sell such mines, mining interests or shares,
and for that purpose, when necessary, to enter into written bonds o,·
contracts with parties for the future sale upon such conditions and at
such price as may be considered best, subject to the approval of said
judge.

must be authorized to enter into a bond or contract for the sale, and,
when necessary, to make and fully execute and place in escrow at
some place approved by such judge, a proper deed of conveyance for
the property. In any case the proceeds of the sale of the property
shall be disposed of as other proceeds and assets of the estate; Pro­ 
uided, That when the decedent was not a citizen of this State, if no
claims are established in the probate court in this State against the
estate, such proceeds, in the absence of any proper objections by par·
ties interested in such estate, must, upon the order of the probate
court, be paid to the proper foreign administrator or representative
or heir of the estate, or to parties entitled thereto as may be deter­
mined by the court, less the cost of the proceedings in the probate

pointment, and of the order or decree assigning and distributing the
estate, must be issued to them as their warrant, and their oath must

accepting the whole must pay to the other parties interested, their just
proportion of the true value thereof, or secure the same to their sat­
isfaction, or, in case of the minority of such party, then to the sat­
isfaction of his guardian. and the true value of the estate must be
ascertained and reported by the commissioners. \Vhen the commis­
sioners appointed to make partition are of the opinion that the real
estate cannot be divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the
owners, they must so report to the court, and recommend that the
whole be assigned as herein provided, and must find and report the
true value of such real estate. ,On filing the report of the commis­
sioners. and on making or securing the payment as before provided,

thereupon the assignment is complete and the title to the whole of
such real estate vests in the person to whom the same is so assigned. 

Section 4gss. Payment• Cor Equality oC Partition:

one's share in the estate to be divided. and cannot be divided with­

giving preference as prescribed in the preceding section. The party
accepting must pay or secure to the others such sums as the commis­
sioners shall award to make the partition equal, and the commission­
ers must make their award accordingly; but partition must not be
established by the court until the sums awarded are paid to the parties
entitled to the same. or secured to their satisfaction.
