There shall be but one form of civil action, and the pleadings therein
shall be as follows: The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff
shall be known as the complaint, and shall contain a statement of the
facts constituting the cause of action, and a demand for the relief to
which he supposes himself to be entitled. If the defendant desires to
plead to the jurisdiction, or in abatement, or both, he shall take such
exceptions in one plea, substantially in the following form :
The defendant pleads in abatement, because [Here state all
the particular exceptions to the jurisdiction, and causes of abate
ment, and how the plaintiff might, or should, have brought his
action in order to avoid them, if they are such as could have been
avoided]. And therefore he prays judgment. By A. B., his at
torney.
All defenses, other than those to the jurisdiction or in abatement,
shall be made by an answer, or by a demurrer.

§ 608. Demurrers must be Special. All demurrers shall dis
tinctly specify the reasons why the pleading demurred to is insufficient.

§ 609. Answer; general and special denial. The defendant in
his answer shall specially deny such allegations of the complaint as
he intends to controvert, admitting the truth of the other allegations,
unless he intends, in good faith, to controvert all the allegations, in
which case he may deny them generally, as follows:
The defendant denies the truth of the matters contained in the
plaintiff's complaint.
He may also, in his answer, state special matters of defense, and
shall not give in evidence matter in avoidance, or of defense, consistent
with the truth of the material allegations of the complaint, unless in his
answer he states such matter specially. Under a general denial the
plaintiff shall be bound to prove the material facts alleged in the com
plaint. If the defendant intends to controvert the right of the plaintiff
to sue as executor, or as trustee, or in any other representative capacity,
or as a corporation, or to controvert the execution or delivery of any
written instrument or recognizance sued upon, he shall deny the same
in his answer specifically.

§ 610. Plaintiff's reply to answer; general and special denial.
The plaintiff may demur or reply to the answer and, in such reply, he
may admit some and deny other of the allegations; or by a general
denial of the defendant's answer, where the answer is special, put the
defendant upon proof of all the material facts in the answer alleged;
but, under such general denial, he may not give in evidence any mat
ter in avoidance, unless it be specially replied. Further pleadings, sub
sequent in their nature, may be had, if necessary, by leave of the court.
§ 611. Pleading over after demurrer overruled, in all civil
actions, upon the overruling of a demurrer, the party may plead over.

§ 612. Counterclaim and set-off how pleaded, in cases where
the defendant has either in law or in equity, or in both, a counterclaim,
or right of set-off, against the plaintiff's demand, he may have the benefit
of any such set-offs or counterclaims by pleading the same, as such, in
his answer, and demanding judgment accordingly; and the same shall
be pleaded and replied to, according to the rules governing complaints
and answers; provided that no counterclaim, set-off, or defense, merely
equitable, shall be available in actions before justices of the peace.

§ 613. Union of legal and equitable causes of action; limita
tion. In every civil action, not brought before a justice of the peace,
the plaintiff may include in his complaint both legal and equitable rights
and causes of action, and demand both legal and equitable remedies ; but
where several causes of action are united in the same complaint they must all be brought to recover, either (1) upon contract, express or implied,
or (2) for injuries, with or without force, to person and property, or
either, including a conversion of property to the defendant's use, or (3)
for injuries to character, or (4) upon claims to recover real property,
with or without damages for the withholding thereof, and the rents and
profits of the same, or (5) upon claims to recover personal property
specifically, with or without damages for the withholding thereof, or (6)
claims arising by virtue of a contract or by operation of law, in favor of
or against a party, in some representative or fiduciary capacity, or (7)
upon claims, whether in contract, or tort, or both, arising out of the same
transaction or transactions connected with the same subject of action.
The several causes of action so united must all belong to one of these
classes, and, except in actions for the foreclosure of mortgages or liens,
must affect all the parties to the action, and not require different places
of trial, and must be separately stated; and in all cases where several
causes of action are joined in the same complaint, or as matter of
counterclaim or set-off, in the answer, if it appear to the court that they
cannot all be conveniently heard together, the court may order separate
trials of any such causes of action, or may direct that any one or more of
them be expunged from the complaint or answer.

§ 614. Pleadings to allege the material facts in concise form.
All pleadings shall contain a plain and concise statement of the material
facts on which the pleader relies, but not of the evidence by which they
are to be proved ; such statement being divided into paragraphs numbered
consecutively, each containing, as nearly as may be, a separate allegation.
Where the pleadings do not fully disclose the ground of claim or defense,
the court may order fuller and more particular statements; and if,
in the .opinion of the court, the pleadings do not sufficiently define the
issues in dispute, it may direct the parties to prepare other issues, and"
such issues shall, if the parties differ, be settled by the court.

§ 615. Untrue allegations or denials; costs. Allegations or
denials made without reasonable cause and found untrue, shall subject
the party pleading the same to the payment of such reasonable expenses,
to be taxed by the court, as may have been necessarily incurred by the
other party by reason of such untrue pleading ; provided that no expenses
for counsel fees shall be taxed exceeding ten dollars for any one offense.

§ 616. Expunging or correcting prolix or uncertain pleading.
Unnecessary repetition, prolixity, scandal, impertinence, obscurity, or
uncertainty in any pleading, or the incorporation of irrelevant, im
material, or evidential matter, shall be ground for a motion to expunge or
otherwise correct such pleading. Such motions shall be in writing, shall
specify the particular exceptions, and the action of the court thereon
shall, upon appeal after final judgment, be reviewable by the supreme
court of errors.

§ 617. All persons interested to be joined as plaintiffs. All
persons having an interest in the subject of the action, and in obtaining
the judgment demanded, may be joined as plaintiffs, except as other
wise expressly provided; and if one who ought to be joined as plaintiff
declines to join, he may be made a defendant, the reason therefor being
stated in the complaint.

§ 618. Who may be made defendants. Any person may be
made a defendant who has or claims an interest in the controversy, or
any part thereof, adverse to the plaintiff, or whom it is necessary, for a
complete determination or settlement of any question involved therein,
to make a party.

§ 619. When parties are numerous one may represent all.
When the persons who might be made parties are very numerous, so
that it would be impracticable or unreasonably expensive to make them
all parties, one or more may sue or be sued or may be authorized by the
court to defend for the benefit of all.

§ 620. Trustee of express trust may sue or be sued alone.
An executor, administrator, or trustee of an express trust, may sue or be
sued, without joining the persons represented by him and beneficially
interested in the suit.

§ 621. Additional parties may be summoned in. The court
may determine the controversy as between the parties before it, where it
can do so without prejudice to the rights of others ; but where a complete
determination cannot be bad without the presence of other parties, the
court may direct them to be brought in. Where a person, not a party,
has an interest or title which the judgment will affect, the court, on his
application, shall direct him to be made a party.

§ 622. Nonjoinder and misjoinder of parties. No action shall
be defeated by the nonjoinder or misjoinder of parties. New parties
may be added and summoned in, and parties misjoined may be dropped,
by order of the court, at any stage of the cause, as it may deem the
interests of justice to require.

§ 623. Substituted plaintiff. When any action has been com
menced in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff, the court may, if
satisfied that it has been so commenced through mistake, and that it is
necessary for the determination of the real matter in dispute so to do,
allow any other person to be substituted or added as plaintiff.

§ 624. Counterclaim; third parties. When a counterclaim raises
questions affecting the interests of third parties, the defendant may, and
if required by the court shall, cause such parties to be summoned in as
parties to said suit.

§ 625. Effect Of Change Of parties. No change in parties, made
by order of court, shall impair any previous attachment of the estate or
body of any person remaining a defendant in the action, nor impair
bonds or recognizances of any person remaining a party, either as against
himself or his sureties, nor impair receipts to the officer for property at
tached ; and, when parties are changed, the court may order new bonds, if
such new bonds are deemed necessary. Orders of court concerning change
in parties may be upon terms, as to costs or otherwise, at the discretion of
the court.

§ 626. Names of partners; amendment, in mesne process by
or against a partnership, it shall not be necessary to insert the names
of the partners, provided the partnership name is stated ; and the plain
tiff shall have the right, within the first three days of the court to which

the process is returnable, to amend it, without costs, by inserting the
names of the partners; and writs returnable before a justice of the peace
may be amended in the same manner, at any time before the pleadings are
closed. No attachment in any civil action against a partnership, of the
private estate of any of its members, shall be valid, unless his name
shall be set forth in the process, at the time of the attachment.

§ 627. Common counts; bill of particulars. The form of com
plaint denominated " the common counts " in the rules under the practice
act, may be used for the commencement of an action in all cases where
any of these counts is a general statement of the cause of action; and

whenever the said action is brought to recover for work and labor done,
when the contract is claimed to have been fully performed, for materials
furnished, goods sold and delivered, and for money had and received.
Before any default shall be entered, or judgment shall be rendered
thereon, the plaintiff shall furnish a bill of particulars of the item or

such community or corporation in its own corporate name.
§ 630. Actions On probate bonds. In all actions upon bonds
taken in a court of probate, the plaintiff shall aver in his complaint or
reply for whose special benefit the action is prosecuted, and how such
persons are interested in the same, and how the act or neglect of the

judgment which shall be rendered in any such case shall not, in any
future proceedings, by scire facias or otherwise, bar or conclude the rights
of other persons interested in the bond.
§ 631. Action by assignee of chose in action. The assignee
and equitable and bona fide owner of any chose in action, not negotiable,

cause may be rightly understood and intended by the court.

§ 635. Plea in abatement; issue of fact; answer over. Upon
the trial of any issue in fact joined upon a plea in abatement in a civil

causes of action, prescribed in § 613.

fer of said action as hereinafter provided, the court shall, without pro
ceeding further in said action, take such bond, and thereupon copies of
the files and record in said action shall be by the defendant transmitted
to the next district court, court of common pleas, or superior court, as
the case may be, to be held in the district or county which would have
original cognizance of an action brought to recover the demand claimed

court to which they may be transmitted, the same shall operate as a
transfer of said action to said court, which shall thereupon have full

attachment, or other security in favor of either party be impaired by such
transfer. If the defendant does not offer and furnish such bond, nor
withdraw said answer, he shall be deemed to waive any claim under
such answer for any greater sum than the court has jurisdiction to
award; and the court may thereupon proceed to take cognizance of the
claim set up in said answer as in other cases, and may render judgment
in his favor, if the same be established, for a sum not exceeding that

proceeded with and disposed of in the same manner as if it had been
brought there by appeal ; and if the defendant, having removed the cause

actions for any tort unaccompanied with force and where the injury is
consequential, if judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, the defendant
or defendants may set off against such judgment any debt which he or
they may hold, either jointly or severally, against the plaintiff; which
right of set-off shall not be affected by any assignment of such judgment
by the plaintiff, but such assignment shall be taken subject to such right

proceed forthwith to make such set-off; but if the debts so held by the
defendant or defendants, and claimed to be set off, are denied by the
plaintiff, such set-off shall not be alfowed. unless the defendant or de
fendants shall have instituted a suit or suits therefor previous to the
rendition of judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and in case such suit
or suits shall, at the time of the rendition of such judgment, be pending

suits, when, if the defendant or defendants shall recover judgment there
in, such judgment or judgments shall be set off against the judg
ment recovered as aforesaid by the plaintiff; but no set-off shall be al
lowed in cases where the defendant has the right of set-off on the trial
of the case.

time of signing and serving it. Such recognizance may be taken in the
following form :
You, C. S., as principal, and E. €., as surety, acknowledge your
selves jointly and severally bound to J. L., in a recognizance (or,
as the case may be, You, E. C, acknowledge yourself bound to
J. L., in a recognizance) of dollars, that the said
C. S. shall prosecute the action which he has now commenced against
the said J. L. at the court to be holden at H. in and
for the county of H., on the Tuesday of ,

peace for county, returnable on the •
day of 19—,) to full effect, and that he shall pay
any costs for which judgment may be rendered against him thereon.
Taken and acknowledged at H. on the day of ,

§ 716. When bond may be ordered by court. When the court
in which any action is pending shall find that any bond taken therein

for prosecution, or on appeal, is insufficient, or that the plaintiff has
given no bond for prosecution and is not able to pay the costs, it shall
order a sufficient bond to be given before trial, unless the trial will
thereby necessarily be delayed ; and the party failing to comply with such
order may be nonsuited or defaulted, as the case may be. Bonds for
the prosecution of any civil action or appeal, pending in any court, may
be taken in vacation by its clerk.

§ 717. Action on probate bond; indorsement of writ. The writ
in every action brought upon a probate bond, or bond taken to a judge
of probate and his successors in office, shall be abatable unless, before its

ment upon it, substantially as follows : " I agree to be responsible for
the costs of this suit." The indorser shall be liable for the costs of suit
in case of judgment for the defendant, and such judgment shall be
rendered against the indorser, and not against the plaintiff. If the in
dorser shall die or remove from this state, a new indorser on such writ
shall be substituted ; and the court before which the suit is pending may
at any time order the substitution of a new indorser, to be approved by
it, who shall indorse the writ and be liable for the costs from the com
mencement of the suit in the same manner as the original indorser. For
any failure to comply with such an order the plaintiff may be nonsuited.

§ 718. Member of community defending to give bond. When, ,
in any action against a community, any individual member of it shall
appear to defend, he shall procure bond with surety to the acceptance of
the court in which the action is pending, to save such community harm
less from all costs which may arise by reason of such appearance; which
bond shall be payable to such community, and be filed in said court;

shall be entitled to the costs recoverable from the plaintiff, unless the
community likewise appeared and incurred the costs of such defense.

chartered by this state or authorized to do business therein may be
accepted as surety or recognizor upon any and all bonds or recognizances
required by law in civil actions or in any proceedings instituted under

is by law required, the bond of such company, duly executed and con
ditioned for the performance of the obligations expressed in such
bond or recognizance, may be accepted by the person having authority
thereto, and shall be filed by him in the court to which such action or pro
ceeding is returnable or pending.

§ 720. Jury docket and jury trials. In the superior court, court
of common pleas, district court of Waterbury, and city courts, dockets

be so entered in the docket as jury cases upon the written request of
either party made to the clerk within thirty days after the return day,
to wit : Appeals from probate involving the validity of a will, or paper
purporting to be such; appeals from the doings of commissioners on
insolvent estates, and, except as hereinafter provided, civil actions in
volving such an issue of fact as, prior to January first. 1880, would not
present a question properly cognizable in equity. When in any of the
above-named cases an issue of fact is joined, after said period, the case
may, within ten days after such issue of fact is joined, be entered in
the docket as a jury case upon the request of either party made to the
clerk; and any of such cases may, at any time, be entered in the docket
as a jury case by the clerk, upon written consent of all parties, or by
order of court. All cases not entered in the docket as jury cases under
the foregoing provisions, including actions wherein the plaintiff sues
for a debt due by book to balance book accounts, actions wherein an
account is demanded and judgment rendered that the defendant do
account, writs of habeas corpus, prohibition, and ne exeat, complaints
for divorce, and all other special statutory proceedings, which, prior to
January first, 1880, were not triable by jury, shall be entered on the

of fact, other than those above specified, which may be joined in actions
entered on the docket as jury cases, be disposed of as court cases.

§ 721. Damages and equitable relief both claimed; separate
trials. Whenever an action brought to recover damages and also to
obtain equitable relief, is duly placed upon the docket as a jury case, no
determination of the equitable issues raised by the pleadings shall pre
vent *a jury trial of the claim for damages, unless both parties agree in
writing to waive a jury, or unless the determination of the equitable
issues has necessarily adjudicated all the facts upon which the claims for
damages rest.

§ 722. More than One iSSUe Of fact. If more than one issue
of fact be joined in a cause upon the docket as a jury case, either party
may, and the party placing it upon the docket as a jury case shall, within
three weeks after the issues are joined, file with the clerk a written notice,
stating whether he desires all such issues to be tried to the jury, and, if
not, which of them he desires to be so tried. All issues which either party
desires tried to the jury, and which are specified in such notice or notices,
shall be so tried; provided they are such as, under the foregoing provi
sions, are properly triable by jury ; but any other issues in the cause shall
be tried as the court may direct, by the court, the jury, or by a committee.

SEC. 236. An act concerning trial

action at whose request the cause is entered upon the docket as a jury
case, shall pay to the clerk, before the commencement of the trial thereof,
the jury fee legally payable for such trial; and such fee shall be taxed
in favor of the party paying the same in the bill of costs in such action,
if final judgment thereon shall be rendered in his favor.

§ 725. Jury in suit before justice of the peace. when any
action is pending before a justice of the peace, in which the matter in
demand exceeds twenty dollars in amount or value, a jury of six shall be
summoned to try the same, on motion of either party, made either before
the return day, in which case it must be supported by filing a written
statement, signed by the adverse party or his attorney, that an issue of fact
will be joined, or after an issue of fact has been joined; provided the
party moving for a jury shall enter into a recognizance with surety to
the adverse party, in such sum as the court shall order, conditioned for
the payment of all costs in case final judgment is rendered against him.

§ 726. Transfer of causes by agreement of parties. Any
cause or the trial of any issue or issues therein may be transferred, by
agreement of the parties, from the superior court in one county to the
superior court in any other county, upon their filing a stipulation to
that effect in the cause, signed by them or their attorneys; and on the
filing of such stipulation the clerk of the court shall transfer the files
in the cause to the clerk of the court in such other county, and if simply
the trial of an issue or issues in said cause are transferred, the files,
after such issues are disposed of, shall be returned to the clerk of the
court in the original county, and judgment may be entered in said court.

§ 727. Offer Of judgment. In all actions on contract, or for the
recovery of money only, the defendant may before trial file with the
justice of the peace or with the clerk of the court, as the case may be,
a written notice signed by him or his attorney, directed to the plaintiff
or his attorney, offering to allow the plaintiff to take judgment for the
sum named in such notice.

§ 728. Acceptance of offer of judgment, in all actions except
those before a justice of the peace, the plaintiff may, within ten days after
being notified by the defendant of the filing of such offer, and in actions
before a justice of the peace within forty-eight hours after such notifica
tion, file with the clerk of the court or justice of the peace, as the case
may be, a written acceptance of said offer signed by himself or his at
torney; and such written acceptance being filed, the court or justice of
the peace shall render judgment against the defendant, as upon default,
for the sum so named, and for the costs accrued at the time of the de
fendant's giving the plaintiff notice of said offer. No trial shall be
postponed because the period within which the plaintiff may accept such
offer shall not have expired, except at the discretion of said court or
justice.

§ 729. Offer not accepted; withdrawal; costs, if the plaintiff
shall not, within said time and before the commencement of the trial,
file his notice of acceptance, such offer shall be deemed to be withdrawn,
and shall not be given in evidence; and the plaintiff, unless he shall
recover more than the sum named in such offer, with interest from its
date, shall recover no costs accruing after he received notice of the filing
of such offer, but shall pay the defendant's costs accruing after said time.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases in which nominal
damages are assessed upon a hearing after a default or a demurrer over
ruled.
§ 4052. Ejectment. Set-off of defendant's improvements.
Final judgment shall not be rendered, in any action to recover the pos
session of land, against any defendant who has, in good faith, believing
his title to the land in question absolute, made improvements thereon
before the commencement of the action, or whose grantors or ancestors
have so made such improvements, until the court shall have ascertained
the present value of such improvements and the amount reasonably due
to the plaintiff from the defendant for the use and occupation of said
land ; and if such value of such improvements exceeds such amount due
for use and occupation, execution shall not be issued until the plaintiff
has paid said balance to the defendant or into court for his benefit; but
if the plaintiff shall elect to have the title confirmed in the defendant,
and shall, upon the rendition of the verdict, file notice of such election
with the clerk of the court, the court shall ascertain what sum ought in
equity to be paid to the plaintiff by the defendant or other parties in
interest, and on payment thereof may confirm the title to said land in
the parties paying it.

§ 730. Precedence of actions in favor of the state. All civil
actions brought by or on behalf of the state, including informations on
the relation of a private individual, shall have precedence of all others
in respect to the order of trial, except actions upon probate bonds.

of error in cases of summary process, and any objections made to the
acceptance of the report of a committee or auditor, or award of an ar
bitrator, shall be heard and determined at the term or session to which
such writs or reports may be returned, unless a continuance be granted
for cause; and appeals from probate, and from the doings of commis
sioners appointed by courts of probate, and actions brought by receivers
of insolvent corporations by order of the court by which such receivers
were appointed, shall have precedence of all other civil actions in respect
to the order of trial, except as provided in § 730.

§ 732. Motion for disclosure. In any civil action in the superior
court, court of common pleas, district court of Waterbury, or city court,

defense of the suit, within the knowledge, possession, or power of the
adverse party, and such facts, papers, books, or documents, being dis
closed or produced, may be given in evidence by the party filing such
motion.

§ 733. Procedure; affidavit and interrogatories. Upon affi

all the matters therein set forth to be true, the person of whom such
disclosure or production is sought shall plead, answer, or demur, in such

motion, each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully, and
the answers shall be in writing signed by the party, and upon his oath.

§ 734. Disclosure; examination of officer of corporation, if
a corporation is party to an action, the opposite party may examine the
president, treasurer, secretary, clerk, or any director or other officer
thereof, in the same manner as if he were a party to the suit.
§ 735. What questions need not be answered. The party
interrogated shall not be obliged to answer a question or produce a docu
ment, the answering or producing of which would tend to criminate
himself, or to disclose his title to any property, the title whereof is not
material to the trial of the action in the course of which he is inter
rogated.
§ 736. Nonsuit or default on failure to comply, if a party
fails to comply with such order of disclosure or production he shall be
nonsuited or defaulted; and upon motion to set aside such nonsuit or
default, the court may grant the motion upon compliance with such
terms as the court may impose.

§ 737. Disclosure not Conclusive. When either party in any
action shall have obtained of the other party a disclosure on oath, respect
ing the matters alleged in any pleading, the disclosure shall not be

all cases in which any person shall have a legal claim against any
executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, growing out of moneys
paid or services rendered for the estate in the hands of such executor,
administrator, guardian, or- trustee, and which should, justly, be paid
out of such estate, a civil action may be brought by such claimant against
such executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, while in office, or
against the successor of any of them, if he shall have ceased to hold such
office, and if such claim shall be found to be a just one, and one which
ought to be equitably paid out of such estate, judgment may be rendered
in favor of such claimant, to be paid wholly out of the estate so held by
such executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee; provided, always,
that if there shall not be sufficient estate to satisfy said claim or claims
in the hands of such executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, this
section shall not be so construed as to prevent any claimant from pur
suing his legal remedy against such executor, administrator, guardian,
or trustee, at his election, for the balance that may be due him, nor from
electing to hold any such official liable to his personal responsibility for
any debt contracted in the execution of his said trust.


§ 740. Demand for receipt not to vitiate a legal tender. The
requirement or demand of a receipt for such amount of lawful money
as may be offered or tendered on account, or in payment or in part pay
ment of any indebtedness, shall not prevent such offer or tender from
being regarded or held to be a legal tender.

law in which the defendant suffers a default, or in which judgment is
rendered for the plaintiff upon a demurrer to the complaint overruled,
and there is a hearing in damages, said hearing in damages shall be to

default entered or demurrer overruled, file with the clerk of the court in
which such action is pending a request in writing that such hearing in
damages be so held.

contradict any allegations in the plaintiff's complaint, except such as
relate to the amount of damage, unless he shall have given written notice
to the plaintiff of his intention to contradict such allegations and of the
subject-matter which he intends to contradict, nor shall the defendant be
permitted to deny the right of the plaintiff to maintain such action, nor
shall he be permitted to prove any matter of defense, unless he shall have
given written notice to the plaintiff of his intention to deny such right
or to prove such matter of defense.

§ 743. Judges of superior court to make rules. The judges
of the superior court shall make such rules as to the manner of filing
such notices and as to the form thereof as they may deem proper.
§ 744. Writings; admission of their execution. Either party
to a civil action may, by a written notice, call upon the other to admit
the existence and due execution of any document, material to the issue,
saving all just exceptions ; and in case of refusal or neglect to make such
admission, within a reasonable time after the receipt of such notice, the
costs of proving such document shall be paid by the party so neglecting
or refusing, whatever may be the result of the action; unless the court
find that such neglect or refusal was reasonable.
§ 745. Reception of evidence objected to as inadmissible.
Whenever evidence offered upon the trial of any civil action is objected
to as inadmissible, the court or committee trying such action shall not
admit such evidence subject to the objection, unless both parties agree
that it be so admitted ; but if either party shall request a decision, such
court or committee shall pass upon such objection and admit or reject
the testimony.

§ 746. Judgment too large; remittitur; correction, if any
judgment has been or shall be rendered by mistake or clerical error, for
a larger sum than is due, the excess may be remitted by the party re
covering the judgment, at the same or any subsequent term or session of
the court in which it was rendered, reasonable notice being first given
to the adverse party or his attorney ; and the court may thereupon order
the record of said judgment to be corrected, and affirm the same for the
amount to' which it has been remitted.

from judgments of justices of the peace, only one counsel shall be heard
on each side, except by special leave of the court ; and in no trial before

tions, arising during the trial of a cause, be argued by counsel, unless the
court shall request it.

district court of Waterbury, or in any city court, may be set aside at the
term succeeding that in which it was rendered or passed, and the cause
reinstated on the docket, on such terms, as respects costs, as the court
may deem reasonable, upon the complaint of any person prejudiced
thereby, showing that a good defense in whole or part existed at the
time of the rendition of said judgment or the passage of such decree,
and that the defendant was prevented by mistake, accident, or other
reasonable cause, from appearing to make the. same.

§ 749. Contents Of Complaint. Such complaint shall be verified
by the oath of the complainant or his attorney, and shall state in general

terms the nature of the defense, and particularly set forth the reason why

may enjoin him against enforcing said judgment or decree until the
decision upon said complaint.

§ 750. Justice appeals when to be entered. All appeals from
judgments of justices of the peace may be entered by the appellant in
the appellate court before two o'clock in the afternoon of the day next
following the return day to which appeals are taken, without costs, and
at any time afterwards during the same term or session but before the
next return day, unless previously entered by the appellee, on paying to
the appellee his costs up to such time, including the expense of a copy if
procured for the purpose of entering the appeal, which shall not be re
funded however the cause may be eventually determined. The appellee
may after two o'clock in the afternoon of the day next following the re
turn day of the court to which the appeal is taken and during the same
term or session, but before the next return day, enter said appeal if not
previously entered by the appellant, and have the judgment of the court
from which the appeal was taken, affirmed, with additional costs. Such
judgment may, at the discretion of the court, be set aside, on motion of
the appellant at any time during the same term or session, on payment
to the appellee of all his costs up to that time, including the expense
of the copy; and the appellant may, on making such payment, prosecute
such appeal as if he had entered it himself.

§ 751. Reservation Of questions Of law. Questions of law may
be reserved for the advice of the supreme court of errors in all cases in
which an appeal could lawfully have been taken to said court had
judgment been rendered therein ; but no such questions shall be reserved
without the consent of all parties to the record. The court or judge
making such reservation shall, in the judgment, decree, or decision made
or rendered in such cases, conform to the advice of the supreme court of
errors.

§ 753. Questions of law and of fact how decided. The court
shall decide all issues of law, and all questions of law arising in the
trial of any issue of fact; and in committing the cause to the jury shall
direct them to find accordingly, and shall submit all questions of fact to
the jury, with such observations on the evidence, for their information,
as it may think proper, without any direction how they shall find the
facts. After the cause is committed to the jury, no pleas, arguments, or
evidence shall be received before the verdict is returned into court and
recorded.

§ 755. Verdict by nine jurors. A legal verdict may be rendered

the parties shall agree in writing, before the rendition of such verdict,
that such portion of the jury may render it.

court may, if it judges the jury have mistaken the evidence in the cause
and have brought in a verdict contrary to it, or have brought in a verdict
contrary to the direction of the court in a matter of law, return them to
a second consideration, and for like reason may return them to a third
consideration, and no more.

§ 757. Special Verdicts. The court shall determine questions
of law referred to it by the jury in a special verdict, which they may
give when they entertain doubts respecting points of law arising in the
cause, or when the parties request it; in which verdict they shall find the
facts, and state the questions of law thus :
If the law be so in such a point, then we find for the plaintiff; but if
the law be otherwise, then we find for the defendant.
And when the jury find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, it shall
assess the damages which he shall be entitled to recover.

§ 758. Judgment on verdict; assessment of damages. The
court shall render judgment on all verdicts of the jury, according to their
finding, with costs, unless the verdict shall be set aside; and in all cases
where judgment is rendered otherwise than on a verdict, in favor of the
plaintiff, the court shall assess the damages which he shall recover.

§ 759. Trial to the court; special finding, in all actions for
legal relief, when the parties shall join in an issue of fact and put them
selves on the court for trial, the judge of such court may hear and try the
same without a jury, and award damages and costs, and grant execution,
in the same manner and on the same principles as in trials by jury;
but in all such trials, if not before a justice of the peace, the court shall
find, upon motion of either party, the facts upon which its judgment is
founded, and cause such finding to become a part of the record.

§ 760. Judgment for or against some of the parties only. In
all civil actions, where a cause of action shall be sustained in favor of or
against only a part of the parties thereto, judgment may be rendered in
favor of or against such parties only; but any defendant against whom
no recovery shall be obtained shall be entitled to costs.
§ 761. Motion for nonsuit. When on the trial of any issue in
fact, in a civil action, the plaintiff shall have produced his evidence and
rested his cause, the defendant may move for judgment as in case of non
suit, and the court may grant such motion, if in its opinion the plaintiff
shall have failed to make out a prima facie case.
§ 762. Refusal to set aside nonsuit; appeal. When a nonsuit
shall have been so granted in the superior court, court of common pleas,
or district court of Waterbury, the plaintiff may, during the same term
or session of the court and before its next return day, file a written
motion to set aside such judgment; and, if such motion shall be denied,
may appeal as in other cases; and to enable him so to do, the court shall
state the whole evidence so produced as aforesaid, that it may become a
part of the record. If such judgment shall be set aside, either on motion,
or appeal, the cause shall be proceeded with as though no nonsuit had
been granted.
§ 763. Facts found to appear of record. All courts shall keep
a record of their proceedings, and cause the facts on which they found
their final judgments and decrees to appear on the record; and such
finding, if requested by any party, shall specially set forth such facts.

Whenever a demurrer to any pleading is filed and argUed before the judge
of any court, and more than one ground of demurrer is set up therein,
the judge, in rendering his decision thereon, shall specify in writing the
grounds upon which said decision is based.

§ 510. Continuance of trial after expiration of term. Any
judge of the superior court or of the court of common pleas, who shall
have commenced the trial of any civil cause, shall have power to continue
such trial and render judgment after the expiration of the term or session
of the court at which such trial commenced ; but such trial shall be
ended and judgment rendered before the close of the next term or
session.

§ 766. Actions on contract; evidence of damages since suit.
In any action founded in contract, for the recovery of damages, the
plaintiff may offer evidence of any damages that may have accrued from
the same cause of action subsequent to the bringing of the suit, provided
he shall have given reasonable notice to the defendant of the damages so
designed to be proved, and may recover judgment for the full amount of
damages he may prove that he has sustained. The plaintiff, upon giving
such notice, may, by leave of the court, increase the amount of his de
mand in the writ, without costs; but no increase shall be made which
shall carry the demand beyond the jurisdiction of the court.

§ 767. Damages in actions for libel, in every action for a
libel the defendant may give proof of intention ; and unless the plaintiff
shall prove either malice in fact, or that the defendant, after having
been requested by him in writing to retract the libelous charge, in as
public a manner as that in which it was made, failed to do so within a
reasonable time, he shall recover nothing but such actual damage as he
may have specially alleged and proved.

§ 768. Damages in actions on penal bonds. In actions on
penal bonds, containing conditions which have been broken, such damages
only shall be assessed as are equitably due, and judgment shall not be
rendered for the whole penalty, unless it appears to be due ; and if upon
a bond with conditions, the breach of which may happen at different
times, a suit be brought upon the first breach, the court, upon the for
feiture of such bond found, shall render judgment for what is due in
equity at the time, with costs, and award execution ; and upon any further
or other breach of condition, the obligee, his executors, or administrators,
may take out a scire facias against the obligor, his executors, or ad
ministrators, from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
given, to show cause why execution should not be awarded for the money
then due, or damages then sustained; and the court shall render judg
ment for what shall appear to be due in equity, and grant execution
thereon, and so, from time to time, till the condition is fully performed ;
but the whole amount of such judgment shall not exceed the penalty
of the bond with interest.

§ 769. Costs how affected by damages, in all actions
founded on tort, tried in the superior court, court of common pleas, or
the district court of Waterbury, or any city court, and not brought to
such court by appeal, if the damages found do not exceed fifty dollars, the
plaintiff shall recover no more costs than damages, unless the title to
property, or a right of way, or to the use of water, is in question, or un
less the damages were reduced below said amount, by reason of some act of
the defendant pending the suit; in either of which cases the plaintiff shall
recover full costs. Judgment for nominal damages upon a hearing after
a default or a demurrer overruled, shall entitle the party in whose favor
they are given to the full taxable costs of the suit.

§ 770. Costs on appeal from judgment of a justice. When,
on an appeal in any civil action from the judgment of a justice of the
peace, or from a judgment of any city, borough, or town court, or from
the doings of commissioners on any insolvent estate, a more favorable
judgment shall not be obtained by the appellant in the appellate court,
he shall recover no costs on such appeal; and the court may at its dis
cretion allow double costs to the appellee. If the appellant shall obtain

fact as requested by him, and all evidence claimed by either party to be
material in determining as to the existence of the facts to which such
exceptions relate, so far as the judge shall find such evidence to have
been given, and any other evidence deemed by the judge to be material,
together with the request for and draft of finding submitted to the
court, shall be made part of tho record. Such exceptions may be in the

A. B. . County,
vs. Court,
C. D. day of — 19—.

court as stated in paragraph No. —, and requests that the following
evidence, which he claims is material, may be certified by the court,
as appears by Exhibit " A," hereunto annexed. 2d. The plaintiff
(or defendant) excepts to the refusal of the court to find as re
quested in paragraph No. of his request, and requests that the
following evidence, which he claims is material, may be certified by
the court, as appears by Exhibit " B," hereunto annexed.
Either party may appeal from any finding of fact, or refusal to find
any fact as requested, to the supreme court of errors, and upon such
appeal the request of the party for a finding and all the evidence allowed
by the court shall become part of the record of the case.

§ 796. Facts how far reviewable on appeal. Every such ex
ception may be assigned as a reason of appeal, and if it appears that
the finding does not present the questions of law decided by the trial
court, the supreme court of errors shall correct said finding accordingly ;
and if it shall appear to said court that material facts have been found
without evidence, or that material facts have been proved and not found,
it shall grant a new trial. The expense of printing any evidence so made
part of the record shall be paid by the party taking the exceptions to

of the filing of such finding, file with the clerk of the court a copy of the
evidence and rulings in the case, duly certified by the stenographer, to
gether with a motion that such evidence and rulings be made a part of
the record on appeal, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the court
to certify a statement of the evidence and rulings, and cause the same
to be made and printed as a part of the record on appeal. The supreme
court of errors shall examine the whole record, so printed on appeal,
and decide any question that may arise thereon; and if it shall appear
from an examination of the entire record that the finding of the judge
does not properly present the facts and rulings, it shall correct such
finding, so that the same shall properly present such facts and such
rulings ; and for the purpose of such correction it shall not be necessary
to make any special motion, but the claim of the appellant for such cor
rection may be presented in the assignment of errors, in the same way as
questions of law are now presented. The clerk need not print as a part
of said record any portion of the stenographer's minutes which the
parties to the case shall agree in writing is not necessary to be printed,
or which the court shall direct not to be printed, and the expense of
printing the evidence shall be paid and taxed as provided in § 796. Said

be so filed, then execution shall be stayed until the final determination
of said cause; but in any case where the judge trying the same is of

tion of justice requires it, such judge may order execution to issue at
any time upon motion and hearing.

make such application will be considered as waived. The court or
judge allowing such appeal may at any time before or during the

giving timely notice thereof to the counsel. Such applications to the
supreme court of errors will not be heard upon testimony taken in
court, but only on depositions taken by the party offering the same, after
having given reasonable notice to the opposite party or his counsel of
the time and place of taking the same, that the latter may have an
opportunity of cross-examination; nor shall such an application be
entertained unless the party making it has, previous to the notice thereof

and delivered, said case shall, upon the written request of either party

thereto, be continued to the next term of said court to be held in said
judicial district.
§ 802. Action of supreme court on appeals, if the supreme
court of errors shall find errors in the rulings or decisions of the court
below, it shall reverse the judgment or order a new trial, unless such
errors are immaterial or such as have not injuriously affected the ap
pellant; but the court shall not be bound to consider any errors on an
appeal, unless they are specifically stated in the reasons of appeal, and
unless it also appears on the record that the question was distinctly
raised at the trial and was decided by the court adversely to the appel
lant's claim, or that it arose subsequent to the trial.

§ 803. Several issues; new trial to be limited, if several issues
are presented by the pleadings, and on the trial of one or more of said

court shall be of opinion that the same questions will arise again if a
new trial should be had, such bill of exceptions may be allowed, and the

evidence, and denied, the party making said motion may, within six days
after the entry of judgment on the verdict, appeal from the denial of
such motion to the supreme court of errors, and the trial court shall
thereupon certify to the supreme court of errors all the evidence in
said cause, and make it a part of the record ; and if said court shall be
of opinion that the verdict was against such evidence, it shall grant a
new trial. The provisions of § 79G as to the expense of printing evi
dence, and as to the taxing of such expense in whole or in part in the
costs, shall apply to appeals taken under this section.

§ 806. Setting aside verdict; appeal. Whenever any court
shall set aside a verdict of a jury in a civil cause, upon the ground that
it is against the evidence, the party in whose favor said verdict was
rendered may appeal from the decision setting aside such verdict to the
supreme court of errors, in the manner prescribed in this chapter, and
the court shall report all the evidence in said cause to the supreme court
of errors, and make it a part of the record without expense to the ap
pellant for printing the evidence, and if said court shall be of opinion
that such decision setting aside the verdict was erroneous, it shall re
verse such decision and order judgment to be entered upon said verdict
in the lower court in favor of the party for whom said verdict was
rendered; and all further proceedings in the cause shall be stayed until
the decision of said supreme court of errors on such appeal. The pro
visions of § 804 shall apply to an appeal taken under this section, and
if material error is found upon the appellee's bill of exceptions, the
supreme court of errors shall not order judgment to be entered on the
verdict, but in lieu thereof shall order a new trial of the cause. If no
bill of exceptions is filed, the appellee will be deemed to have waived all
objection to any rulings and instructions of the trial court which were

from the judgment that may subsequently be entered upon the original
verdict.

courts respectively, to the supreme court of errors next to be held in the

and in cases where no damages shall be appraised, such city, village, or
borough may immediately proceed to lay out and open such street, or
make and complete such improvement or public work in the same man
ner as if no appeal had been taken; and in proceedings on writs of
habeas corpus the judge may, at his discretion, decline to order stay of
execution.

ceed to final judgment thereon and issue execution for the costs thereof
in the same manner as if said cause had been tried and decided by said
court.

the papers in said cause, and thereupon issue such execution.

ance. If any corporation made a garnishee and cited in to disclose,
was not indebted to, and had no effects of, the defendant in its posses

paymaster stating such fact to be filed in said court, on the return day
of the complaint. If such affidavit shall be so filed and the plaintiff
shall bring a scire facias against such corporation upon a judgment
rendered against the defendant in the complaint, and it shall be found

nishee, cited in to disclose before a court held in a town other than that

effects of the defendant in his possession when the writ was served upon
him, it shall be a sufficient excuse for his not appearing before said
court if he file therein on the return day of the writ his affidavit stating
such facts; but if any garnishee, when duly cited in to disclose, shall
fail to appear without reasonable excuse, or shall refuse to disclose on
oath whether he has any effects of the defendant in his possession, or is
indebted to him, then, if the plaintiff shall bring a scire facias against
him on a judgment recovered against the defendant in the suit, judg
ment shall be rendered against such garnishee personally for the costs
accrued on the scire facias, though it shall appear that he had no effects
of the debtor in his possession and was not indebted to him.
§ 885. Disclosure by garnishee. The court may examine upon
oath any garnishee cited in to disclose as to whether, at the time of the
service of the foreign attachment, he had effects of the defendant in his
hands, or was indebted to him, and may hear any' other proper evidence
respecting the same; and if it appear that such garnishee had not
effects of the defendant in his possession, or was not indebted to him, he
shall recover judgment for his costs ; but if it appear that such garnishee
had in his possession effects of the defendant, or was indebted to him,
the court shall ascertain the amount, and the same shall, if the plaintiff
recovers judgment and brings a scire facias against the garnishee, be
prima facie evidence of the facts so found; but the defendant shall
then have a right again to disclose on oath, and the parties may intro
duce any other proper testimony regarding such facts. If the plaintiff,
in such action by foreign attachment, withdraws his suit, or fails to re
cover judgment against the defendant, such garnishee shall be entitled
to judgment for his costs.

of abode of, its secretary or clerk, or any agent or clerk employed by
said corporation to keep its accounts, or pay its employees in the town
where it . transacts business, and where any moneys, which may be owing
to the defendant, are due and payable. When the plaintiff shall re
cover judgment in any action so brought and obtain execution for the
same, a demand by the officer serving such execution on, or at the usual
place of abode of, the secretary, agent, or clerk of said corporation with
whom service was originally made, shall be a sufficient demand of said
corporation. 
§ 887. Service on disbursing agent or paymaster of gar
nishee. When any corporation having a disbursing agent or paymaster,
with an office or place of business in this state, shall be named as gar

of fraud upon the attaching creditor, who, if he shall recover judgment

bona fide purchaser of such note for valuable consideration, without

writ was* left with him, or shall not expose them to be taken on the
execution, or shall not pay the officer, when demanded, the debt due to
the defendant at the time the copy of the writ was left with him, such

disclose on oath, judgment may be rendered against him, as for his own
debt, to be paid out of his own estate, with costs, and execution shall be
granted accordingly; if it appears on the trial, that the effects are of
less value, or the debt of less amount, than the judgment recovered

or to the amount of the debt; and if it appears that the defendant has
no effects of such agent, or is not indebted to him, be shall recover costs.

so that no demand can be made of him in person by the officer serving the
same, the clerk of the court issuing such execution may, at the request
of the creditor or his attorney, indorse thereon an order signed by such
clerk, requiring the officer to whom such execution is directed to make
said demand by letter forwarded by mail, postage paid, addressed to such
garnishee, or in such other manner as said clerk shall direct; and such
demand, when so made, shall be as effectual as if made of the garnishee
personally : but if such garnishee shall have lodged with the clerk of
said court a written notice, under his hand, of the appointment of an
agent or attorney on whom such demand may be made, such officer shall
make the like demand of such agent or attorney, if within his precincts,
and make return thereof on such execution.

rendering judgment in the original suit shall, by a written order thereon
by him subscribed, direct; and by leaving with his agent or attorney,
if any has been appointed by him in the manner provided in §933, a
true and attested copy of the writ; and process so issued and served
shall be as effectual against such garnishee as if served upon him
personally.
§ 935. Scire facias founded on justice judgment, when a
writ of scire facias shall be brought against a garnishee, founded on a
judgment rendered by a justice of the peace, it shall be signed by and be
returnable before said justice, and shall be heard and determined by him,

death or otherwise before any such scire facias is taken out and returned,

of the peace, as in other cases.
§ 936. Stay of execution when debt is not payable. When it
shall appear on the hearing of any scire facias, founded on a foreign at
tachment, that the debt due to the principal is not yet payable, the
court shall direct the execution to be stayed until the time the debt would
have become payable ; and when the debt was not payable at the time the
demand was made on the execution, the court shall allow the garnishee
his reasonable costs for defending against such scire facias, to be deducted
out of the debt so due.

a scire facias shall be brought to recover a debt or effects taken by a
foreign attachment, if any person or persons, either jointly or severally,

or owners thereof, the defendant in such scire facias, having notice or
knowledge of such assignment, ownership, or claim, may give notice in
writing, signed by proper authority, and duly served, to such claimant or
claimants, or his or their attorney, that such scire facias is pending, and
that he or they may appear, if they see cause, and defend against it;
which notice, when the claimant or claimants shall reside out of the
state shall be given in such time and manner as the court, before which
such action is pending, shall direct ; and thereupon, unless such claimant
or claimants shall, within such time as such court may direct, give to
such defendant sufficient security, to the approval of the court, to
indemnify him against all costs, he may suffer judgment to be given
against him on such scire facias, which shall be a bar to the claim of the
assignee or assignees of the debt, or the owner or owners of the effects,
against him for the same. In case such assignee or assignees, owner or
owners, shall give such security, and make effectual defense against the
scire facias, he or they shall be entitled to the costs that shall be re
covered against the plaintiff; but if he or they fail to make an effectual
defense, the judgment rendered on the scire facias against the defendant
shall be a bar to any claim against him by them for such debt or effects.
If, after such security has been given, the defendant, on due notice given
him, shall neglect to appear and disclose on oath, if required, on the trial
of such scire facias, or, in case a commission shall be issued, shall
neglect to make disclosure before the commissioners, he shall take no
benefit by the provisions of this section, nor of such security.

§ 938. Commission to take disclosure of garnishee. The court
before which any scire facias shall be pending may issue a commission to
take the disclosure of the defendant on oath, when, on account of his

of the estate, to deliver to the defendant the legacy or distributive share
to which he is entitled.

mand, to be applied on such execution; and if at the time of such pay
ment or delivery the garnishee would have been required by law to make
such payment or delivery to the defendant, if there had been no attach
ment, or would have been justified in so doing, he shall be credited for
such payment or delivery to the officer, in his administration account.
§ 943. Scire facias against executor, administrator, or
trustee. If, upon demand so made, the garnishee shall neglect or refuse
to make such payment or delivery, the plaintiff in the foreign attachment
may maintain a scire facias against him as executor, administrator, or
trustee, as aforesaid ; and if the plaintiff recover judgment, no execution

so much of the moneys, or of the value of the effects attached, and for
which he would otherwise have been liable to the original defendant, as
may be necessary to satisfy the judgment; which payment shall be
credited to such executor, administrator, or trustee, in his administration
account; but he shall not be credited with the costs recovered on such
scire facias, unless the court of probate shall be of opinion that he was
justified in incurring the same. If he shall not so pay such judgment,
60 much of the same, including interest thereon from the date when said
judgment is rendered, as shall not exceed the whole of the moneys, or
of the value of the effects attached, and for which he would otherwise

foreclosure by sale should be decreed, it shall, in its decree, appoint a
person to make such sale and fix a day therefor, and shall direct whether

such sale shall be brought into court, there to be applied if the sale be
ratified, in accordance with the provisions of a supplemental judgment
then to be rendered in said cause specifying the parties who are en
titled to the same and the amount to which each is entitled ; and if any
part of the debt or obligation secured by the mortgage or lien fore
closed, or by any subsequent mortgage or lien, was not payable at the
date of the judgment of foreclosure, it shall nevertheless be paid as far
as may be out of the proceeds aforesaid as if due and payable, with
rebate of interest, however, where such debt was payable without interest.
§ 4146. When proceeds of sale will not pay in full, if the
proceeds of such a sale are not sufficient to pay in full the amount secured
by any mortgage or lien thereby foreclosed, the deficiency shall be de
termined, and thereupon judgment may be rendered in said cause for
such deficiency against any party liable to pay the same who is a party
to the cause and has been duly served with process or appeared therein,
and all persons liable to pay the debt secured by such mortgage or lien
may be made parties; but all other proceedings theretofore or meanwhile
begun for the collection of the debt shall be stayed during the pendency
of the foreclosure suit, and if a deficiency judgment is finally rendered
therein, such other proceedings shall forthwith abate. If the property
shall have sold for less than the appraisal provided for in § 4142, no
judgment shall be rendered in that suit or* in any other for the unpaid
portion of the debt or debts of the party or parties upon whose motion

plied it shall be apportioned between them.
§ 4147. Expenses Of Sale and COStS. The court shall order

plaint therein shall leave a true and attested copy thereof at the office
of the town clerk of the town in which such mortgage or lien is re
corded, at least twelve days before the return day of such process; and

lodge for record any further certificates of said Hens. Such liens may
be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of tax
liens.

said list when finally completed. Said lien shall exist from the
first day of October in the year previous to that in which said taxes
become due until one year after said taxes become due, and, during
such existence, shall take precedence of all transfers and incumbrances,
in any wise affecting said interest in said item, or any part of it.
which become matters of record after said first day of October. As
to mortgages, attachments, and liens, which become matters of record
before said first day of October, said tax lien shall take precedence
only of those which purport to cover or affect said interest in the
whole of said item. Said lien, while it exists as above and before

mencement of such services, or the furnishing of such materials, sub
ject to apportionment as provided by § 4163, and may be foreclosed
like a mortgage of personal property.

imprisonment, appear before such court when in session, or the judge
who held the same, or the judge who in vacation made the order of
commitment, and apply for a discharge from imprisonment, which such
court or judge may, for sufficient cause shown, direct.
§ 1000. Averments of return may be denied or other facts
alleged. In every writ of habeas corpus where the return of the defend
ant sets forth as a cause for the imprisonment of the petitioner any
mittimus or warrant of commitment signed by a justice of the peace,
such petitioner or the party imprisoned or restrained may deny any of
the facts set forth in the return, or may reply to such return, alleging

the opposite party, to answer all damages in case the plaintiff in the
action in which the injunction is applied for shall fail to prosecute the
action to effect; provided that a bond need not be required when, for
good cause shown, the court or judge shall be of opinion that a tem
porary injunction ought to issue without bond.
§ 1005. Injunctions may be granted forthwith or after notice.
Injunctions may be granted forthwith, if the circumstances of the case
demand it; or the court or judge may cause immediate notice of the
application to be given to the adverse party, that he may show cause
why such injunction should not be granted; and it shall be sufficient,

or judge the original complaint containing the demand for an injunc

thereof, it may be dissolved or modified by the court or judge who is
sued it, by any judge of the court to which the action is returnable, or
by any judge of the superior court; provided a written motion for such
dissolution shall be preferred before the return day. After the return
day such motion must be addressed to the court in which the action is
pending, or, if such court is not actually in session, to a judge thereof;
but in case of the inability of such court or judge, from any cause, to
hear such motion, it shall be heard and determined by the superior court
or by any judge thereof.

§ 1009. Continuance of injunction pending appeal. When a
temporary injunction is granted and upon final hearing judgment is
rendered adverse to its continuance, either party may apply to the
court rendering such judgment, representing that he is desirous of
taking the case to the supreme court of errors, and praying that said
temporary injunction may be continued until the final decision therein;
and, unless said court shall be of opinion that great and. irreparable
injury will be done by the further continuance of said injunction, or
that said application is made only for delay and not in good faith, the
court shall continue said injunction until a final decision be rendered
in the supreme court of errors.
§ 1010. Mandatory injunction; stay pending appeal, when
judgment shall be rendered for a permanent injunction ordering either
party to perform any act, the court, upon an application similar to that
mentioned in § 1009, shall stay the operation of such injunction until

of prohibition, as prayed for; but if such party shall appear, he may

arising in the cause, and if sufficient ground is found, shall issue a writ
of prohibition to the party prosecuting the cause, and to the judge or
judges of said inferior court or tribunal, commanding them to proceed
no further in the trial of the cause, and shall tax costs in favor of the
complainant. If the party in the court below, or the judge or judges
of such court or tribunal, disobey such writ, such superior court or
judge may punish them for the contempt, according to the rules of the

plea of replevin, wherein the plaintiff declares and says: that
ever since the day of 19—, the defendant
has wrongfully detained, and still wrongfully detains, from the
plaintiff, said goods and chattels, being the property of the plaintiff ;
and that the plaintiff on said day was and ever since has been law
fully entitled to the immediate possession thereof; to his damage
in the sum of dollars; to recover which damage with
costs, as well as the possession of said goods and chattels, he brings
this suit.
Hereof fail not, but make due service and return.
Dated at this day of 19—.
E. F., Justice of the Peace.
County of ss. Town of 19 —.
J. S. of , being duly sworn, deposes and says that he
believes that A. B. of is entitled to the immediate pos
session of the following described goods and chattels, namely:
; that said deponent knows the nature and value of said
goods and chattels; and that their true and just value, as nearly as
the deponent can estimate it, is dollars. J. S.
Subscribed and sworn to before me,
E. F., Justice of the Peace.
Be it remembered that at the town of in
county, on the day of 19—, there
personally appeared before me, G. H. of , as principal,
and I. J. of , as surety, which surety is known to me
to be of sufficient pecuniary responsibility to respond to the amount

severally bound unto C. D. of , in a recognizance of
dollars, that A. B. of , who prayed out the
foregoing writ of replevin against C. D.. shall prosecute his suit to
effect and shall pay to said C. D. any judgment that said C. D. may
recover in said suit, and return to said C. D. the goods and chattels
that may be replevied under said writ, and pay to him all damages
that he may sustain by the replevying thereof, if said A. B. fail to
establish his right to the possession of the same, in said suit.
E. F., Justice of the Peace.
Similar forms may be used in writs returnable before other courts.

§ 1059. Replevin; jurisdiction of court how determhed. in
determining the jurisdiction of the court to which writs of replevin may
be made returnable, the value of the matter in demand shall be de
termined by adding to the value of the goods and chattels which it
commands to be replevied, as stated in the writ, the amount of the
alleged damages for their wrongful detention, except in cases where the
action is brought by any person to recover his cattle or other animals
when impounded, in which cases the jurisdiction of the court shall be
determined by the amount of damages alleged in the plaintiff's declara
tion to have been done by such detention.

§ 1060. Replevin; service; new bond; process void, when.
The officer who replevies property shall leave a true and attested copy
of the process with the defendant, or at his usual place of abode, within
three days after such replevy, and shall retain the property replevied in
his custody for twenty-four hours after leaving such copy, unless the
defendant indorses on the writ that he is satisfied with the amount and
sufficiency of the recognizance taken on issuing the same. If the de
fendant is not satisfied with such recognizance, he may, at any time
before the return day of the writ, cite the plaintiff or his attorney, or the
officer serving the writ, if the property still remains in his custody, to
appear at once before a judge of the superior court, court of common
pleas, or district court of Waterbury, or a county commissioner or justice
of the peace residing in the county where the replevin was effected, to
respond to a motion for a new bond; and the said judge, county com
missioner, or justice of the peace, may hear such motion, and at his
discretion order a new or further bond, conditioned like the recognizance
taken on issuing the writ, signed by the obligors, and delivered to the
defendant, by whom it shall be transmitted to the court to which the writ
was made returnable; and if such order be made while the property
replevied remains in the hands of the officer, he shall not deliver said
property to the plaintiff until such bond be given. If such order for a
new bond shall not be complied with, or if the officer shall fail to leave
with, or at the usual place of abode of, the defendant, a true and attested
copy of the writ, or to retain the property in his custody, as hereinbefore
provided, then such writ of replevin shall be null and void. Whenever
it shall appear to the court before which an action of replevin is pending,
that the replevin bond attached to the writ is insufficient, such court may,
at its discretion, order a new or further replevin bond to be given by
the plaintiff, conditioned like the recognizance taken on issuing the writ,
and if he shall fail to comply with such order, he shall be nonsuited.
§ 1061. Replevin; how parties may plead. (The defendant
may plead the general issue, with or without notice, as may be necessary,
or any special plea, or make an avowry of a taking for lawful cause of the
goods and chattels replevied; but if, under a plea of the general issue,
he intends to deny that he detained the same, he shall file with his plea
a notice that he disclaims all right to the property; in which case, if
final judgment shall be rendered in his favor, he shall not be entitled to
any judgment of return.)
Sec. 47, An act concerning pleadings in
actions of replevin.
Section 1. All pleadings in actions of replevin brought after the
first day of January, 1908, shall be in such form as the judges of the
superior court shall from time to time order.
Sec. 2. So much of chapter 73 and of section 633 of the general
statutes as is inconsistent herewith is hereby repealed.

§ 1062. Replevin; jurisdiction; transfer of cause to higher
COUrt. If the defendant by avowry or special plea sets up a title or
right of possession in himself, and that the value of the goods and chattels
replevied, or the amount of any claim for the security of which he may
be entitled to their possession, exceeds the amount up to which the court
to which the action is brought has jurisdiction, and, at the time of plead
ing, moves that the cause be transferred to such higher court holden
in the same county as would have original jurisdiction of a suit for a
matter in demand of the value so alleged by him to be involved in the
cause, the court shall inquire into the question of value thus raised,
and if his said allegations respecting the same are found true, and he
offers to give a bond with a sufficient surety, in such a sum, not exceed
ing one hundred and forty dollars, as the court may order, conditioned
that he will enter a copy of the record of said cause in such higher
court at or within ten days after its next return day, and prosecute his
plea or avowry to effect, the court shall grant said motion and proceed
no further in said cause; but, upon the copy of the record being entered
as aforesaid in the docket of the proper court, the cause shall be effect
ually removed to such higher court, and shall be there proceeded with as
if originally brought to it; nor shall any bond, attachment, or other
security existing in favor of either party be impaired or invalidated by
such removal. If the court to which such motion for a removal of the
cause is addressed finds on inquiry that said allegations to the effect that
the value or amount of the matter in controversy exceeds its jurisdiction,
are not true, or if the defendant shall fail to give a bond as above pro
vided, such motion shall be denied ; and in such case, or if such a bond
be given but its condition be broken, the court shall proceed with said
cause to a final adjudication.
§ 1063. Replevin; procedure on withdrawal or nonsuit of
plaintiff. If the plaintiff in any action of replevin shall fail to appear,
or shall withdraw, or be nonsuited, before or after issue joined, the de
fendant may make a suggestion in the nature of an avowry, stating
the injury he has sustained, and his claim for damages; and the court
shall render judgment for the defendant to recover such damages as he
has sustained, and his costs, and for a return of the property replevied.
 1064. Replevin; pleading; evidence; damages. If the
plaintiff's right to the possession of the property described in the writ
is put in issue, without any disclaimer of title by the defendant, the
plaintiff shall be bound to prove the same, and may also show the dam
ages sustained by him by reason of the detention of the property by the
defendant; and if the defendant, at or before the time of joining issue,
file a written notice that he claims damages for the replevin, he may give
evidence of such damages; and judgment, if for the plaintiff, whether
upon default or trial, shall be for his damages and costs, and, if for the
defendant, shall be for a return of the property, and for his damages
and costs.

§ 1065. Damages for property not replevied, if any of the
property described in the writ is not replevied, but the plaintiff proves
a general or special property therein with a right to its immediate
possession, and that it is wrongfully detained by the defendant, and
claims full damages therefor, the value of such property with damages
for its detention, may be included in any judgment which the plaintiff
may recover, and it shall be so stated upon the record. No costs shall
be taxed against a common carrier, defendant in any action of replevin
for recovery of goods, wares, merchandise, baggage, or freight, in the
possession of a common carrier, where such common carrier upon de
mand surrenders such property to the officer serving the writ and makes
no defense to the action.
§ 1066. Replevin; nonresident defendant; security for costs.
In actions of replevin brought against persons not inhabitants of this
state, the court before which the action may be pending may make such
order as to security to be given by the defendants for costs that may be
recovered by the plaintiffs, as it may deem just.
§ 1078. When a lease of any land or building or of any apartment
in any building, whether in writing or by parol, shall terminate by lapse
of time, or by reason of any express stipulation thereof, or under the
provisions of § 4044, and the owner or lessor, or his legal representa
tives, shall desire to obtain possession of the same at the termination of
the lease, or at any subsequent time, he or they shall give notice to the
lessee to quit possession of said land, building, or apartment, at least ten
days before the termination of the lease, or before the time specified in
the notice for the lessee to quit possession, except when such lease is
terminated by reason of non-payment of rent, in which case said notice
shall be given at least five days before the time specified in the notice
for the lessee to quit possession, which notice shall be in writing, sub
stantially in the following form :
I (or we) hereby give you notice that you are to quit possession
of the (land, building, or apartment, as the case may be), now
occupied by you, on or before the (here insert the day, place, and
date). A. B.
Duplicate copies of such notice shall be made, one of which shall be
delivered to the lessee, or left at his place of residence, by a proper
officer or indifferent person. If, at the expiration of the ten days or the
five days, as the case may be, the lessee shall neglect or refuse to quit
possession of the premises, any justice of the peace or commissioner of
the superior court residing in the town in which said premises are sit
uated, may, on complaint of the lessor or owner, and on his giving bond
to prosecute to effect, issue a summons to the lessee, which shall be
served at least six days inclusive before the time of trial, to appear
before a justice of the peace in said town, to answer to said complaint ;
provided, that when there is no justice of the peace in the town in
which the premises are situated before whom the same can lawfully be
tried, the complaint may in like manner be brought and tried before a
justice of the peace of an adjoining town in the same county in which
the premises are situated, and in such case may be tried before a jury
from said adjoining town, when a jury shall be demanded by either
party.
§ 1079. Summary process; waiver of notice to quit. When
