tained ; and
Third. If he has had the party in his custody or power, or under
restraint, and has transferred such custody or restraint to another, he

case as law and justice shall require.
Sec. 12. When the writ of habeas corpus is returned, the court or
justice shall, without delay, proceed to examine the causes of the iin-

Sec. 13. Whenever it appears from the return of the writ or
otherwise, that the party is detained on any process under which any
' other person has an interest in continuing his imprisonment or re
straint, the party shall not be discharged until sufficient notice shall
have been given to such other person or his attorney, if within the
state, or within thirty miles of the place of examination, to appear

bail, and the court at which he shall be required to appear ; and any
justice of the peace authorized thereto may, at any time before the
sitting of said court, bail the party pursuant to such order.
Sec. 18. If the party is committed on mesne process in any civil
action, for want of bail, and if it shall appear that the sum for which
bail is required is excessive and unreasonable, the court or justice

the same ; and if the sheriff or deputy should be committed upon
such process, he maybe committed to the jail of any other county
than his own.
Sec. 24. Upon such refusal or neglect of the person to whom the
writ of habeas corpus is directed, the court or justice may also issue
a precept to any officer or other person designated therein, commanding
him to bring forthwith before such court or justice the person
for whose benefit the writ of habeas corpus was issued ; and the
prisoner shall be thereupon discharged, bailed, or remanded, in like
manner as if he had been brought in upon the writ of habeas
corpus.
Sec. 25. Every person guilty of such refusal or neglect to receive
and execute a writ of habeas corpus shall moreover forfeit and pay
to the party aggrieved thereby, a sum not exceeding one thousand
dollars.
Sec. 26. If any one who has in custody or under his power any
person entitled to any writ of habeas corpus, whether any writ has
issued or not, shall, with intent to elude the service of such writ, or
to avoid the effect thereof, transfer such prisoner to the custody, or
place him under the power or control of any other person, or conceal
him, or change the place of his confinement, the person so offending
shall forfeit and pay to the party aggrieved thereby a sum not ex
ceeding one thousand dollars.
Sec. 27. The recovery of any penalty imposed by this chapter

injury or damage sustained by the aggrieved party.
Sec. 28. No person who has been discharged upon a writ of
habeas corpus shall be again imprisoned or restrained for the same

thereupon to bail any person, for whatever cause he may be committed
or restrained, or to discharge him, as law and justice shall
require.
Sec. 30. Whenever any person is committed to jail on any criminal
accusation, for want of bail, any justice of the supreme court, or
any justice of the peace of the same county, specially appointed by
said supreme court, or by either justice thereof, may admit him to
bail in like manner as might have been done by the court or magis33
trate who committed him ; and the said justices respectively shall have

during the intermarriage, to which she shall not have relinquished
her right of dower by deed, except in the cases provided for in the
twenty-third section of this chapter.
Sec. 2. Of inheritances that are entire, where no division can be

certain manner, as of a third part of the rents, issues, growth, or
profits thereof, to be computed and ascertained in manner by this
chapter directed.
Sec. 3. Where dower is legally demandable in more than One lot
or parcel of land belonging to the same person, such assignment need
not be of a part of each lot or parcel, but may be together in one lot,
as the interest and convenience of the widow and the heir or person
having the next immediate estate of freehold shall require.
Sec. 4. The heir or person having the next immediate estate of
freehold in all or any of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments which
belonged to the deceased during the intermarriage, whereof the widow
is dowable, may, in writing and under his hand, assign and set off to

tenements, and hereditaments, according to the provisions of this
chapter, at any time after the decease of the husband.
Sec. 5. The tenant in possession, though having but a term for
years, first giving notice to the owner or owners of the next estate of
freehold or inheritance, and inviting them to join with him, if they
will, in assigning and setting off dower, may, upon demand of the

estate.
Sec. 7. If after one month's demand, made by the widow, of the
persons empowered to set off dower, the same shall not be set off to
her in all the lands, tenements, and hereditaments in which they are
empowered to set off the same, or the dower assigned and set off
shall be less in value than the widow is entitled to, or shall be
assigned and set off in a manner inconsistent with the provisions and
true intent of this chapter, such widow may sue for and recover her
dower and damages for the detention of the same by writ of dower,
to be brought either against the tenant in possession, or the tenant
or tenants of the estate of freehold subsisting at the time of the de
mand.
Sec. 8. The leaving of the demand with the tenant or person in
possession of the premises out of which dower is demanded, or, if no
person be in possession, the posting up of the same in any conspicuous

Sec. 9. Whenever judgment for dower shall be rendered by any
court of common pleas in favor of a plaintiff in an action of dower,
the said judgment shall set forth the manner in which the plaintiff
shall be endowed ; and either party aggrieved by such judgment may
appeal therefrom to the next term of the supreme court in the same
county.
Sec. 10. If no such appeal be prayed in open court within two
days after such judgment, the same shall be final, and shall annul the
dower before that time set off and assigned to the plaintiff in the
case, if any had been set off and assigned.
Sec. 11. Whenever final judgment for dower shall be rendered in
any action of dower, in favor of the plaintiff, the court rendering the
same shall appoint three disinterested commissioners, who shall be
under oath, to be administered by said court, or by any justice of the
peace or notary public, equally and impartially to set forth by metes
and bounds, or to ascertain in the special manner pointed out in such
judgment, the dower of the plaintiff, and also the damages sustained
by the plaintiff by detention thereof after demand therefor.
Sec. 12. Such commissioners shall appoint time and place to meet
the parties in the said action, and give them notice thereof; and at
such time and place, notwithstanding the absence of either or both of
said parties, and unless good cause is shown, proceed to discharge
their duties, and make report of the same under their hands with a
plat of the premises and of the dower set off, if set off by metes and
bounds, as soon as may be, to the court appointing them.
Sec. 13. No sufficient cause to the contrary being shown, such
court shall confirm such report, and enter up judgment according to
the same, and issue a writ of execution for such damages, and to put
the plaintiff in possession of her dower or perception of rents and
profits, as the case may require.
Sec. 14. Such execution shall not be issued until after the plain
tiff produces to the court, or clerk, if the court be adjourned, a cer
tificate that the judgment of such court, confirming such report, has
been duly recorded in the office of the town clerk of the town in
which the premises lie ; the expense of which shall make part of the
costs in the action of dower.
Sec. 15. No action of dower shall abate by the death of the de
fendant named therein, where the defendant is tenant of the free
hold, if the property passes by devise or descent from him ; but such
death being suggested, the heir or devisee shall be summoned to ap
pear at the same or at the next term, in the discretion of the court
in which the action is pending, and take upon him the defence of the
suit, and the suit shall proceed against him in the same manner as if
he had been the original defendant.
Sec. 16. Whenever the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, in
which dower is claimed, are situate in two or more counties in this
state, the suit for dower, whether at law or in equity, may be brought
in either county where any of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments
are situate.
Sec. 17. Any court of probate in this state which shall have
granted letters of administration, or letters testamentary on the estate

hereditaments lying within the state, which belonged to the deceased
during his intermarriage, whereof such widow is dowable. Notice
of such application shall be given to all parties interested, except the
applicant, in the manner prescribed by law for notices by courts of
probate : Provided, however, that all the heirs at law or devisees hav
ing the next immediate estate of freehold, and all parties interested
in all or any of said lands, tenements, or hereditaments, may join in
such application, in which case, no notice thereof need be given.
Sec. 18. Whenever such an application shall be made to such
court of probate, such court, upon hearing the parties thereto, shall,
in the first instance, decree in what manner the dower ought to be
assigned in the premises described in the application, whether by
metes and bounds, or in some special and certain manner as set forth
in the second section of this chapter ; and any person aggrieved by
such decree may appeal therefrom to the next term of the supreme
court to be holden in the same county ; but if no appeal be made
within the time prescribed by law, or if the parties in writing within
that time waive their right to appeal, then such decree shall be final.
Sec. 19. Upon the rendering of a final decree on such application,
prescribing the manner in which the dower shall be assigned, the
court rendering the same shall appoint three disinterested men, who
shall have and exercise the same duties and powers, and in the same
manner, and under the same restrictions as though they were ap
pointed to set off dower in. an action of dower according to the pro
visions of this chapter ; and their report being made to such court,
like proceedings shall be had thereon, and with like effect, as in ac
tions of dower.
Sec. 20. No damages for detention of dower shall be allowed on
such application, but an appeal may be had from the decree of a
court of probate affirming any report to said court, made by the men
appointed to set off dower upon such application, and like proceed
ings shall be had thereon, as is provided in sections eleven, twelve,
thirteen, and fourteen of this chapter.
Sec. 21. In case any infant is interested in any lands, tenements,
or hereditaments which belonged to any deceased person, whereof
his widow is dowable, the application to the court of probate to
cause such widow's dower therein to be assigned and set off to her,
and the waiver of the right of appeal, and all other necessary acts,
may be made, signed, and done in behalf of such infant, by his guar
dian, duly appointed, whose acts in the premises shall be conclusive
on such infant : Provided, that when such widow is herself the guar
dian of such infant, such court of probate shall, and in all other cases
where, in their discretion, they may deem it advisable, such court
may, upon receiving such application, appoint a guardian ad litem for
such infant, whose acts alone in the premises, in all subsequent pro
ceedings, shall be conclusive on such infant.
Sec. 22. No woman who shall be endowed of any lands, tene-
ments, or hereditaments as aforesaid shall commit or suffer any strip
or waste thereon, upon penalty of forfeiting the whole of that part
of the estate upon which such strip or waste shall be made, and the
damages assessed for waste, to him who has the immediate estate
of freehold or inheritance, remainder or reversion, by an action of
waste to be brought therefor ; and all tenants in dower shall main

whereof they may be endowed, in good repair during the term, and
shall leave them so at the expiration thereof.

the same be devised or bequeathed for the jointure of the wife in lieu
of her dower, to take effect in her own possession immediately on the
death of her husband, and to continue during her life, or in fee, de
terminable by such acts only as would forfeit her dower at the com
mon law, such conveyance shall bar her dower of the residue of the
lands, tenements, and hereditaments which her said husband at any
time possessed : but if the said conveyance was before marriage and
during the infancy of the woman, or after marriage, in either case the
widow may, at her election, waive such jointure, and demand her
dower : Provided, the same be done in writing within twelve months
after the probate of the will, if there be one, and if not, then within
twelve months after the granting of letters of administration on her
deceased husband's estate.
' Sec. 24. Whenever any conveyance or devise intended to be in
lieu of dower shall, through any defect, fail to be a legal bar thereto,

dower, the estate so conveyed with intention to bar her dower shall
thereupon cease and determine.

jointure, or any part thereof, without any fraud or covin, by lawful
entry or action, she shall be endowed of so much of the residue of

dowable, as the same lands, tenements, or. hereditaments, wherefrom
she was so evicted and expelled, shall amount and extend to.
Sec. 26. Widows may bequeath the crops as well of their dower
as of other lands and tenements ; and if any widow shall erect any
fence on or around her dower land, her executors or administrators
may enter thereon and remove the same, doing as little damage as
may be to the freehold, at any time within six months after the death
of such widow.

the same rules shall prevail in actions of trespass for mesne profits.
Sec. 2. All joint tenants, coparceners, and tenants in common,
who now are or hereafter may be actually seized or possessed of any

partition.
Sec. 5. If the tenant in reversion or remainder in fee join with
the tenant for life or years in compelling partition of any such lands,
tenements, or hereditaments, against the other co-tenants, the parti-
tion shall be of the whole estate, and binding on the heirs and assigns

tenrft for life or years, or the expiration of the term for years ; but
the surviving plaintiff may prosecute the said action to final judg
ment and execution.
Sec. 6. Partition of real estate holden in joint tenancy or in common,
and situate in two or more counties in this state, may be sued
for by action at law or by bill in equity, in either county in which

ducted in the same manner, in all respects, as if all the real estate
therein named was situate in the same county.

shall be served in manner prescribed by law, at least twenty days
before trial ; who may come in and defend in the same manner as
though he had been originally made a party to such action ; and if
the person thus summoned shall appear, or shall neglect to appear,
his name may be inserted in the process by the court ; and judgment
shall be rendered in such action in the same manner as if such person

charge of the interest of the person for whom he shall be appointed
guardian.
Sec. 12. No action of partition shall be abated by the decease of

Sec. 13. If such heirs or devisees shall voluntarily appear in court
without such notice, the court may proceed without further delay to

or administrators, may and are hereby authorized to have his or their
action of account against such receiver or receivers, or either of them,
as his or their bailiff or bailiffs, for receiving more than his or their
part or proportion as aforesaid.
Sec. 2. Any defendant in such action may appeal to the next
term of the supreme court to be holden in the same county, from a
judgment of the court of common pleas against him that he shall ac
count ; but if no such appeal be prayed in open court, within two
days next after such judgment, the same shall be final.
Sec. 3. Upon rendering final judgment against the defendant in
such action that he shall account, the court rendering the same shall
appoint not exceeding three auditors ; who, upon being sworn by
said court, or any justice of the peace or notary public, to a faithful
and impartial discharge of their duties, shall appoint a time and
place to meet the parties in such action, and to take the account as
required in such judgment, and give notice thereof to said parties.
Sec. 4. Whenever any defendant shall unreasonably refuse or neg
lect to appear at the time and place assigned by such auditors, or,
after appearing, shall refuse or neglect to render an account, the au
ditors may award to the plaintiff the whole of his demand ; and it
shall be in the power of the auditors to administer an oath to the
parties respectively, and to examine them respecting their accounts
and the matters submitted to them ; and upon either of the parties
refusing to take an oath truly to answer such questions as shall be
asked, or to answer directly to the interrogatories put to him, it shall
be in the power of the auditors to commit him to jail, there to re
main at his own charge until he consent to take such oath, and
answer such interrogatories.
Sec. 5. Whenever the auditors appointed in any case shall have
made their report or award concerning the matters submitted to them
to the court from whence they shall have received their appointment,
if no legal cause shall be shown for setting aside such award or re
port, judgment shall be rendered in conformity thereto, and also for
costs, including such reasonable allowance to the auditors for their
services as the court shall judge proper to make ; and the s-aid com
pensation to the auditors shall be paid down by the party in whose
favor final judgment shall be rendered, before he shall have execu
tion on such judgment.
Sec. 6. A major part of the auditors appointed in any case, agree
ing and signing such report or award, the same shall be equally bind
ing and conclusive as if agreed to and signed by all of them : Pro
vided that it shall be necessary, in order to give validity to such
report or award, that all the auditors shall accept of their appoint
ment, and meet on the subject matter thereof.
