causes of action stated therein.

Sec. 144.) When any of the matters enumerated in sub

of any written instrument.
10. That a written instrument upon which a pleading is founded,
is without consideration, or that the consideration of the same has failed

material allegations of the complaint which is not denied under oath
shall be taken as confessed.

state distinctly the nature and the several items thereof and shall con
form to the ordinary rules of pleading.

Sec. 153.) On the trial of such issue, if the defendant shall

the defendant shall not be permitted to set off unliquidated or uncertain
damages founded on a tort or breach of covenant on the part of the
plaintiff.

Sec. 156.) Nothing in the preceding section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the defendant from pleading in set-off any
counter-claim founded on a cause of action arising out of, or incident
to, or connected with the plaintiff's cause of action.

Sec. 157.) If the defendant desire to prove any payment,
counter-claim or set-off, the same shall be plainly and particularly de
scribed in the answer, so as to give the plaintiff full notice thereof.

Sec. 158.) Where the defendant has answered, and the
plaintiff shall afterward amend his pleading, it shall not be necessary
for the defendant to answer a second time, but such original answer

Sec. 159.) Pleas shall be heard and determined in due
order of pleading under the direction of the court.

defendant shall be served upon the attorney for the plaintiff within the
time the same is required to be filed; and within the like time a copy

demanded by either party, such demand shall then be made, and if not
then made, the right to a trial by jury shall be regarded as waived and
the cause shall be tried by the court, unless the court shall otherwise
order. The party in whose favor the verdict of the jury shall be, shall
pay to the clerk of the court the amount of the per diem of the jurors
before the verdict shall be recorded. In case of a disagreement of the
jury, the party who demanded the jury in the first instance shall pay
to the clerk of the court the per diem of the jurors at the time of the dis
charge of the jury or within such time as the court may order. All
sums so paid shall be taxed and allowed as part of the costs of the party

mit all issues of fact to a jury.

arising on the pleadings, and all pleas in abatement and other dilatory
pleas remaining undisposed of shall be determined, and it shall be no
cause for the postponement of trial of the issues of law that a party is
not prepared to try the issues of fact. When juries are demanded, all
issues of law and all pleas which do not go to the merits of the case shall
be disposed of by the court before the case is called for trial on the
merits. The rules hereinafter prescribed for the trial of causes before
the jury shall govern in trials by the court so far as may be applicable.

Sec. 182.) The parties may in any case submit the matter
in controversy between them to the court upon an agreed statement of
facts made out and signed by them or counsel, and filed with the clerk,
upon whicli judgment shall be rendered as in other cases, and in such
case the statement so agreed to and signed, and certified by the court to
be correct, and the judgment rendered thereon, shall constitute the record
of the cause.

Sec. 183.) In all cases brought up from inferior courts,
whether by appeal or certiorari, the case shall be tried de novo.

Sec. 184.) In suit tried by a jury the trial shall proceed
in the following order, unless the court should for good cause, to be
stated in the record, otherwise direct :
1. The plaintiff or his counsel shall read his complaint to the jury
and make a statement of his case before introducing his evidence.
2. The defendant or his counsel shall read his answer and then make
Â» statement of his case to the jury, or he may, at his election, defer
making such statement until after the close of the testimony on behalf
of the plaintiff.

7. The intervenor, if any, shall then introduce his evidence.
8. The parties shall then be confined to rebutting testimony on each
side.

Sec. 185.) The court may, at its discretion, at any time
before the conclusion of the argument, where it appears to be necessary
to the due administration of justice, allow a party to supply an omission
in the testimony, on such terms and under such limitations as the court
may prescribe.

Sec. 186.) After the evidence is closed and before the com
mencement of the argument, the court shall charge the jury. The
parties may then submit the case to the jury in argument; the party
having under the pleadings the burden of proof on the whole case shall
be entitled to open and close the argument; where there are several
parties having several claims or defenses, and represented by different
counsel, the court shall prescribe the order of argument between them.

Sec. 187.) At any time before the jury have retired the
plaintiff may take a non-suit, but he shall not thereby prejudice the
right of an adverse party to be heard on his own claim for affirmative
relief ; when the case is tried by the judge, such non-suit may be taken
at any time before the decision is announced.

Sec. 188.) The jury may either decide the case in court
or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they shall be kept together
in some convenient place, under the charge of an officer, until they
agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by the court ; but the court may,
in its discretion, permit them to separate temporarily for the night
and at their meals and for other proper causes.

Sec. 189.) The officer having the jury under his charge
shall not suffer any communication to be made to them, or make any
himself, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, unless
by order of the court. And he shall not, before the verdict is rendered,
communicate to any person the state of their deliberations or the verdict
agreed upon.

Sec. 190.) If the jury are permitted to separate, either dur
ing the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admon
ished by the court that it is their duty not to converse with or suffer
themselves to be addressed by any other person on any subject connected
with the trial.

Sec. 191.) When the jury wish to communicate with the
court they shall make their wish known to the officer having them in
charge, who shall inform the court thereof, and they may he brought
into open court, and, through their foreman, shall state to the court,
either verbally or in writing, what they desire to communicate.

Sec. 192.) The jury may, after the cause is submitted to
them, be discharged by the court when they can not agree and both par
ties consent to their discharge, or when they have been kept together for
such time as to render it altogether improbable that they can agree.

Sec. 193.) They may also be discharged by the court when
any calamity, sickness or accident may, in the opinion of the court, re
quire it.

Sec. 194.) The final adjournment of the court before the
jury have agreed upon a verdict discharges them.

Sec. 195.) Where a jury has been discharged as herein
provided, without having rendered a verdict, the cause may again be
tried at the same or another term.

Sec. 196.) The court may during the retirement of a jury,
proceed to other business and adjourn from time to time, but shall be
deemed open for all purposes connected with the case before the jury.

Sec. 197.) In all cases where a trial of an issue of fact is
held by the courts of record of the territory, the decision of the court
shall be in writing, and filed with the clerk within thirty days after the

three-fourths of such jury shall be sufficient to render a verdict therein.
And in all such jury trials, when the said jury of twelve persons shall
unanimously agree upon a verdict, said verdict shall be signed by the
foreman thereof, and returned into court ; but where such jury do not
unanimously agree upon a verdict, but three-fourths thereof do agree,
then said three-fourths of such jury shall sign the verdict so agreed
upon by them, and notify the court of such fact, and thereupon all of
said jury shall be returned into court, and shall then deliver to the court
the verdict so signed by three-fourths of such jury ; and the court shall
receive and cause to be read and recorded such verdict in the cause, and
judgment shall be entered thereon as in other cases now provided by law.

Sec. 205.) The clerk or the court shall read the verdict
aloud and the court shall inquire of the jury if such is their verdict.
If any juror disagrees to the verdict, they shall again be sent out to
further consider the case, but if not, the court shall receive the same and
order the same to be entered in the minutes, and the jury shall be dis
charged ; Provided, That in cases where a verdict may be rendered by
three-fourths of the jury, the verdict shall be received unless more than
three jurors disagree thereto.

Sec. 206.) When the verdict is announced either party
may require the jury to be polled, which is done by the clerk or judge
asking each juror separately if such is his verdict. If any juror
answers in the negative, the jury shall again be sent out for further
deliberation; but if each juror concurs in the verdict, the same shall
be received and noted in the docket, except in cases provided for in
the two succeeding sections, and the jury shall be discharged. Pro
vided, That in cases where a verdict may be rendered by three-fourths
of the jury, the verdict shall be received unless more than three jurors
answer in the negative.

Sec. 207.) If the verdict is informal or defective, the
court may direct it to be reformed at the bar, and where there has been
a manifest miscalculation of interest, the court may direct a computa
tion thereof at the bar, and the verdict may, if the jury assent thereto,
be reformed in accordance with such computation.

Sec. 208.) If the verdict is not responsive to the issue sub
mitted to the jury, the court shall call their attention thereto, and send
them back for further deliberation.

Sec. 209.) The verdict of the jury is either general or
special. A general verdict is one whereby the jury pronounces gener
ally in favor of one or more parties to the suit upon all or any of the
issues submitted to them. A special verdict is one wherein the jury
finds the facts only on issues submitted to them under the direction of
the court.

Sec. 210.) The special verdict must find the facts as estab
lished by the evidence, and note the evidence by which they are estab
lished, and the findings must be such as that nothing remains for the
court but to draw from such facts the conclusions of law.

Sec. 211.) A special verdict so found shall, as between
the parties, be conclusive as to the facts found.
