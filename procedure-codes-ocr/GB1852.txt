out of which the Writ of Summons issued, or to a Judge ; and in case it
shall appear to such Court or Judge that reasonable Efforts have been
made to effect personal Service, and either that the Writ has come to
the Knowledge of the Defendant, or that he wilfully evades Service

Court or Judge to order that the Plaintiff be at liberty to proceed as
if personal Service had been effected, subject to such Conditions as to
the Court or Judge may seem fit.

Schedule (A.) to this Act annexed, and marked respectively Nos. 1,

after any Application to set aside such Writ or any Proceeding thereon,
and whether the same or Notice thereof shall have been served or
not, be amended by such Judge Without Costs.

be done by such Amendment ; and the Amendment shall be made
upon such Terms as the Court or Judge, by whom such Amendment
is made, shall think proper ; and in case it shall appear at the Trial
of any Action on Contract that there has been a Misjoinder of
Defendants, such Misjoinder may be amended, as a Variance, at the

and to proceed against the original Defendant or Defendants,
and the Person or Persons so named in such Plea in Abatement :
Provided that the Date of such Amendment shall, as between the
Person or Persons so named in such Plea in Abatement and the

" what or what Part] Plea :"

add a Joinder of Issue for the Defendant.

sufficient Evidence of its having been so renewed.

the Cause, by whom any Writ of Capias ad satisfaciendum shall have
been issued, shall justify the Sheriff, Gaoler, or Person in whose
Custody the Party may be under such Writ, in discharging such
Party, unless the Party for whom such Attorney professes to act
shall have given written Notice to the contrary to such Sheriff,
Gaoler, or Person in whose Custody the opposite Party may be ;

and the Costs ; but nothing herein contained shall affect the
Right of the legal Representative of the deceased Claimant, or the
Liability of the surviving Claimant to such legal Representative ;

to Judgment for Recovery of Possession of the Property, unless some
other Person shall appear and defend within the Time to be appointed
for that Purpose by the Order of the Court or a Judge, to be made
upon the Application of the Claimants ; and it shall be lawful for the
Court or a Judge, upon such Suggestion being made and upon such
Application as aforesaid, to order that the Claimants shall be at liberty
to sign Judgment within such Time as the Court or Judge may think
fit, unless the Person then in possession, by himself or his Tenant, or
the legal Representative of the deceased Defendant, shall within such
Time appear and defend the Action ; and such Order may be served
in the same Manner as the Writ ; and in case such Person shall appear
and defend the same, Proceedings may be taken against such new
Defendant as if he had originally appeared and defended the Action ;
and if no Appearance be entered and Defence made, then the
Claimant shall be at liberty to sign Judgment pursuant to the
Order.
SEC. 197. In case of the Death of a sole Defendant or of all the

aforesaid, may proceed against the surviving Defendant or Defendants
to Judgment and Execution.
SEC. 200. The Claimant in Ejectment shall be.at liberty at any Time

Court, and lodge with the proper Officer such Sum and Sums of
Money as the Lessor or Landlord shall in his Answer swear to be
due and in arrear over and above all just Allowances, and also the
Costs taxed in the said Suit, there to remain till the Hearing of the
Cause, or to be paid out to the Lessor or Landlord on good Security,
subject to the Decree of the Court;, and in case such Proceedings
for Relief in Equity shall be taken within the Time aforesaid, and
after Execution is executed, the Lessor or Landlord shall be accountable

less than the Rent reserved on the said Lease, then the said Lessee

all the Rent and Arrears, together with the Costs, then and in such
Case, all further Proceedings on the said Ejectment shall cease and be
discontinued; and if 'such Lessee, his Executors, Administrators, or
Assigns, shall, upon such Proceedings as aforesaid, be relieved in
Equity, he and they shall have, hold, and enjoy the demised Lands,

Tenant, or any one holding or claiming by or under him, shall refuse
to deliver up Possession accordingly, after lawful Demand in Writing

which shall be recovered by the Claimants in the Action ; and it shall
be lawful for the Court or Judge upon Cause shown, or upon Affidavit

shown, to make the same absolute in the whole or in part, and to
order such Tenant or Person, within a Time to be fixed, upon a Consideration
of all the Circumstances, to find such Bail, with such Conditions
and in such Manner as shall be specified in the said Rule or
Summons, or such Part of the same so made absolute ; and in case

induce the Court or Judge to enlarge the Time for obeying the
same, then the Lessor or Landlord filing an Affidavit that such Rule
or Order has been made and served and not complied with shall be
at liberty to sign Judgment for Recovery of Possession and Costs of
Suit in the Form contained in the Schedule (A.) to this Act annexed,

present be exercised ; and the Provisions of all Statutes not inconsistent
with the Provisions of this Act, and which may be applicable

Law, and every Judge thereof, and any Judge sitting at Nisi Prius,

to amend, or not ; and all such Amendments may be made with or
without Costs, and upon such Terms as to the Court or Judge may
seem fit ; and all such Amendments as may be necessary for the Purpose

that Purpose, be it enacted as follows :
SEC. 223. It shall be lawful for the Judges of the said Courts, or
any Eight or more of them, of whom the Chiefs of each of the said

Rules and Orders for the effectual Execution of this Act, and
of the Intention and Object hereof, and for fixing the Costs to be
allowed for and in respect of the Matters herein contained, and the
Performance thereof, and for apportioning the Costs of Issues,
and for the Purpose of enforcing Uniformity of Practice in the
Allowance of Costs in the said Courts, and of ensuring as far as may
be practicable an equal Division of the Business of Taxation amongst
the Masters of the said Courts, as in their Judgment shall be
necessary or proper, and for that Purpose to meet from Time to Time
as Occasion may require : and it shall further be lawful for the Judges
of the said Courts, or any Eight or more of them, of whom the Chiefs
of each of the said Courts shall be Three, from Time to Time to
exercise all the Powers and Authority given to them by an Act of

Act as to the Rules, Orders, or Regulations made in
pursuance thereof shall be held applicable to any Rules, Orders, or

Business therein.

may be issued, entered, and taken, as may by the Judges of the said
Courts, or any Eight or more of them, of whom the Chiefs of each
of the said Courts shall be Three, be deemed necessary or expedient
for giving Effect to the Provisions herein-before contained, and in
such Forms as the Judges of such Courts respectively shall from
Time to Time think fit to order; and such Writs and Proceedings
shall be acted upon and enforced in such and the same Manner as
Writs and Proceedings of the said Courts are now acted upon and
enforced, or as near thereto as the Circumstances of the Case will
admit ; and any existing Writ or Proceeding, the Form of which
shall be in any Manner altered in pursuance of this Act, shall nevertheless
be of the same force and virtue as if no Alteration had been
made therein, except so far as the Effect thereof may be varied by
this Act.
SEC. 225. It shall and may be lawful to and for the Judges of each of the said Courts from Time to Time to make such Rules and Orders for the Government and Conduct of the Ministers and Officers their respective Courts, in and relating to the Distribution and Performance of the Duties and Business to be done and performed
in the Execution of this Act, as such Judges may think fit and
reasonable : Provided always, that no additional Charge be thereby
imposed on the Suitors.

Proceedings should be rendered more effectual, be it enacted as
follows :
SEC. 226. In case any Action, Suit, or Proceeding in any Court
of Law or Equity shall be commenced, sued, or prosecuted, in disobedience
of and contrary to any Writ of Injunction, Rule, or

or of any Judge thereof, in any other Court than that by or
in which such Injunction may have been issued, or Rule or Order
made, upon the Production to any such other Court or Judge thereof

or taken), or any Judge thereof, shall stay all further Proceedings
contrary to any such Injunction, Rule, or Order ; and thenceforth
all further and subsequent Proceedings shall be utterly null and
void to all Intents and Purposes : Provided always, that nothing
herein contained shall be held to diminish, alter, abridge, or vary the
Liability of any Person or Persons commencing, suing, or prosecuting
any such Action, Suit, or Proceeding contrary to any Injunction, Rule,
or Order of either of the Courts aforesaid, to any Attachment, Punish
ment, or other Proceeding to which any such Person or Persons are,
