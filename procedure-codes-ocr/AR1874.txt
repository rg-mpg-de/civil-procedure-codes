CODE OF PRACTICE.

SEC. 4446. The “ Code of Practice in Civil Cases” shall regulate the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in all the courts of this state, though
not expressly enumerated, and of all that may hereafter be created; and all laws
coming within the purview of its provisions shall be repealed.

SEC. 4447. Remedies in civil cases are divided into two classes:

First. Actions.

Second. Special proceedings.

SEC. 4448. A civil action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice, by
one party against another, for the enforcement or protection of a private right,
or the redress or prevention of a private wrong. It may also be brought for the
recovery of a penalty or forfeiture.

SEC. 4449. Every other remedy in a civil case is a special proceeding.

SEC. 4450. The forms of all actions and suits heretofore existing are abolished.

SEC. 4451. There shall be but one form of action for the enforcement or protection of private rights, and the redress or prevention of private wrongs, which
shall be called a civil action.

SEC. 4452. In such action the party complaining shall be known as the

' plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant.

SEC. 4453. The proceedings in a civil action may be of two kinds:

First. At law.

Second. In equity.

SEC. 4454. The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable proceedings
in all cases where courts of chancery, before the adoption of this code, had

jurisdiction; and must so proceed in all cases where such jurisdiction was exelusive.

SEC. 4455. In all other cases the plaintiff must prosecute his action by proceedings at law.

SEC. 4456. An action upon a written obligation or judgment which has been
lost or destroyed, may be prosecuted by proceedings at law. (Hz:-il Code, secs. 1-6.

SEQ. 4457. No action to obtain a discovery shall be brought, except as provided in the next section. _

SEC. 4458. Where any person or corporation is liable, either jointly or severally with others, by the same contract, an action may be brought against any of
the parties who are liable, to obtain discovery of the names and residences of
the others who are also liable.

SEC. 4459. In such action the plaintiff shall state in his complaint, in effect,
that he has used due diligence, without success, to obtain the information asked
to be discovered, and that he does not believe the parties to the contract, who
are known to him, have property sufficient to satisfy his claims. The complaint
shall be verified, and the cost of such action shall be paid by the plaintiff, unless
the discovery be resisted.

SEC. 4460. The writ of ne ezzeat, as a remedy in a civil action, is abolished.

SEC. 4461. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceedings adopt-ed
shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of the action, but merely a change
into the proper proceedings by an amendment in the pleadings, and a transfer
of the action to the proper docket.

SEC. 4462. The error mentioned in the last section may be corrected by the
plaintiff, without motion, at any time before the defendant has answered; or afterward, o_n motion in court.

SEC. 4463. Such error is waived by failure to move for its correction at the
time and in the manner prescribed in this chapter, and all errors in the decisions
of the court, on any of the motions named in this chapter, are waived, unless excepted to at the time, which maybe done by the clerk noting at the end of

such decision, words of the following import: “To which decision the plaintiff
(‘or defendant) excepts”

SEC. 4464. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correction made in the
following cases: _

First. When the action has been commenced by equitable proceedings, the
defendant, by motion made at the time of filing his answer, may have them
changed into proceedings at law, when it appears that by the provisions of section 4455 the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings at law, unless his answer presents an equitable defense.

Second. When the action has been commenced by proceedings at law, the defendant, by motionimade at or before the time of filing his answer, may have
them changed into equitable proceedings, when it appears that by the provisions
of section -H5-1 the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings in equity.

SEC. 4465. Where the action has been properly commenced by proceedings
at law, either party shall have the right, by motion, to have any issue which
heretofore was exclusively cognizable in chancery, tried in the manner hereinafter prescribed in cases of equitable proceedings (ed); and if all the issues are
such as heretofore were cognizable in chancery, though none were exclusively so,
the defendant shall have the right to have them all tried as in cases of proceedings in equity. '

SEC. 4466. If the plaintiff's claim is for money due by contract, and the defondant puts in a defense of exclusively equitable cognizance, upon the plaintiff
filing an affidavit that he verily believes that he will succeed in the action, and
that the collection of his claim after judgment will be endangered by the delay
arising from such defense being put in, the court shall require the defendant to
give security for the payment of any judgment that the plaintiff may obtain in
the action, and upon his failure to give such security, shall order the defendant
to pay into court an amount sufficient to discharge the plaintiff’s claim, and his
probable costs; upon which order execution may be issued as upon a judgment,
and the amount collected upon execution shall be brought into court and await
the decision of the action, and be paid to the plaintiff or defendant, according
to such decision. But no such security shall be required if the trial of the
equitable defense. takes place during the term at which it is put in, nor until all
defenses to the action, other than those of equitable cognizance, are tried or disposed of in favor of the plaintiff.

SEC. 4467. The provisions of this chapter concerning the prosecution of a
