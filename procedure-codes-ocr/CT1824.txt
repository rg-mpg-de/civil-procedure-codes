TITLE l. Account.
AN Act authorising the appointment of Auditors
in actions of Account.
SEC. 1. JE it enacted by the Senate and House of
D Representatives in General Assembly con*
vened, That whenever a judgment shall be rendered
against the defendant, in an action of account, that he
do account, the court shall appoint not more than three
able, disinterested, and judicious men, to take the ac
count ; who shall be sworn according to law, and shall
have power to appoint the time and place for the hear
ing, and shall give reasonable notice thereof to the par
ties : And if the defendant shall refuse to attend, at the
time and place appointed, and produce his books, and
render his account, the auditors shall receive from the
plaintiff his statement of the account, and award to him
the whole sum he claims to be due.
SEC. 2. If the parties appear, and produce their
books, the auditors shall have power to administer an
oath to them, and examine them respecting their ac
counts, and to enquire of any other lawful witnesses :
and if either party shall refuse to be sworn, or to answer
any proper questions respecting his account, the audit
ors may commit him to gaol, there to continue till he
will consent to be sworn, and answer all proper inter
rogatories : and the auditors shall liquidate and adjust
the accounts, and award that the party in whose favor
they find the balance to be due, shall recover the same,
and shall make report to the same or the next succeed
ing session of the court. The party in whose favor the
report is made, shall pay to the auditors their fees and
expenses, which shall be allowed in the bill of cost : and
on the return and acceptance of the report, the court
shall render judgment, that the party in whose favor it
is made, shall recover the sum found to be due, with his
lawful cost. And no appeal shall be allowed on any
judgment given on a report of auditors.
SEC. 3. In actions of account, brought before justi
ces of the peace, when judgment is rendered that the
defendant shall account, they shall take and adjust the
account, without the appointment of*auditors, and render
judgment accordingly.
SEC. 4. An executor, who is also residuary legatee,
when all, or any part of his legacy is withholden from
him, by his co-executor, may bring his action of ac
count against his co-executor for the recovery thereof j

tees against executors. When two persons hold any
.estate as joint tenants, tenants in common, or coparce
ners, if one of them shall receive, use or take benefit of
such estate, in greater proportion than the amount of
his interest in the principal estate, he, and his executors
or administrators, shall be liable to render an account
to his co-tenant ; and such co-tenant, his executors or .
administrators, may bring an action of account against
such receiver, and recover such sum as he has received
more than his proportion as aforesaid.
SEC. 5. When there shall be such claim, by one coexecutor,
or residuary legatee, against two or more coexecutors
; or when there is a claim by one joint-tenant,
tenant in common, or coparcener, against two or more
cp-tenants, the remedy shall be by bill, or petition in
equity.

governor, lieutenant-governor, a senator, judge, jus
tice of the peace, or clerk of the court to which it is re
turnable^!) Attachments may be granted against the
goods and chattels of the defendant, and for want there
of, against his lands or person. When the plaintiff prays
out an attachment, a sufficient bond shall be given, conditioned
to prosecute his action to effect, and answer all
damages in case he makes not his plea good : and if it
shall appear to the authority signing the writ, that he is
unable to pay the cost of suit, if a recovery should be had
against him, then he shall procure a surety in such bond
of prosecution. If the plaintiff is not an inhabitant of
this state, or if an inhabitant of this state, and it appears
to the authority signing the writ, that he is unable to pay
the cost of suit, if a recovery is had against him, then,
whether the suit be a summons or attachment, he shall
procure surety in a bond from some substantial inhabitant
of this state to prosecute his action to effect, and answer
all damages, in case he make not his plea good.
SEC. 2. All process, by attachment or summons,
shall be directed to the sheriff, his deputy, a constable,
or some indifferent person ; but no writ of attachment
or summons shall be directed to an indifferent person to
serve, till the same shall be complete in all other respects
; nor shall it be so directed, unless more defend-
ants than one are therein named, and described to be of
different counties in the state ; or unless where, in case
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff, or one of the plain
tiffs, if there be more than one, or his or their agent or
attorney, shall make an affidavit respecting the writ, in
the words following : " You solemnly swear (or affirm)
that .you verily believe the plaintiff, (or plaintiffs, as the
case may be) is in danger of losing the debt, (damage, or
other thing, as the case may be) in this writ, unless an
indifferent person be deputed for the immediate service
of the same : So help you God :" which oath the au
thority signing such writ is empowered to administer ;
and he shall certify on the writ that he administered the
same ; for which service he shall be entitled to receive
twelve cents, but which shall not be taxed in the bill of
costs : in which cases, the authority shall insert in the
writ the name of the indifferent person to whom it is di
rected ; but need not insert the reason of such direction.
And if any writ of attachment, or summons, shall be di
rected to an indifferent person, except in the cases, and
under the regulations abovementioned, the same shall
abate.
SEC. 3. The sheriff may depute a proper person, on
some special occasion, to serve a particular writ ; which
deputation shall be entered on the back of the writ ; who,
after service thereof, shall make oath before a justice of
the peace, that he faithfully and truly served the same,
according to his indorsement thereon, and that he did
not fill up said writ, nor give direction to any person to
fill up the same ; and such justice of the peace shall cer
tify on the writ that he administered said oath accord
ingly ; and thereupon the service thereof shall be good
and valid.

answer thereto.
SEC. 5. A summons shall be served, by the officer's
reading the same in the hearing of the defendant or de
fendants, or leaving an attested copy thereof at the place
or places of his or their usual abode : an attachment
shall be served, by attaching the goods and chattels of the
defendant, or if nonecanbe found, by attaching the person
or lands of the defendant. When an attachment is serv
ed, by taking the body of the defendant, notice -shall be
given to him, by the officer's reading the writ in his
hearing, or by leaving an attested copy at his usual place
of abode. When any estate, real or personal, is attach
ed, the officer serving the writ shall leave with the per
son whose estate is so attached, or at the place of his usual
abode, if within the state, a true and attested copy of the
writ, and of his return, describing the estate attached
thereon. And when any real estate is taken, the officer
serving the writ, shall leave a true and attested copy
thereof, and a description of the estate taken, at the
town clerk's office, in the town where the land lies, within

ny, turnpike company, or other corporation, together
with the interests, rents and profits, due, and growing due

law, and levied upon and sold to satisfy any judgment
and execution. And the attachment of any such rights
or shares shall be, by leaving a true and attested copy of
the writ, by the officer serving the same, with his proper
endorsement thereon, as in other cases, with the defend
ant, or at his usual place of abode, if within this state, and
with the cashier of such bank, or with the secretary or
clerk of such company or corporation ; and such rights
or shares, together with the interests, rents and profits,
shall be holden to respond the judgment, which may be
recovered in such action, for the term of sixty days after
the rendering thereof, and no longer.
SEC. 7. No estate attached as aforesaid, shall be held
to respond the judgment obtained by the plaintiff at
whose suit the same is attached, either against the debtor,
or any other creditor, unless such judgment-creditor
take out execution on such judgment, and have the same
levied on goods or personal estate, within sixty days after
final judgment, or on real estate, and have the same ap
praised and recorded within four months after such judg
ment shall have been obtained : or if said goods or estate
are incumbered by any prior attachment, the execution
to be levied as aforesaid, within the respective times
aforesaid, after such incumbrance is removed.
SEC. 8. When the defendant is not a resident or in-
habitant of this state, and has estate within the same
which is attached, a copy of the writ, describing the es-
tate, shall be left, by the officer, with the agent or attor
ney of the defendant, within this state ; and when land
is attached, a like copy shall be left in the office of the
town clerk where the land lies, as in cases where the de
fendant belongs to this state : but if the defendant has not
an agent or attorney within this state, then a like copy
shall be left with him, who has the charge or possession
of the estate attached.
SEC. 9. On writs of scire facias, in which execution
maybe issued against the person and property of the defendant,
on the judgment that may be rendered thereon,
the process may be by attachment of the person or prop
erty of the defendant, to be proceeded with as to bail,
and in all respects, as in ordinary cases.
SEC. 10. Officers serving writs shall return them, or
cause them to be returned, to the clerks of the courts to
which they are made returnable, at least forty-eight hours
prior to the day of the session of the court : and writs re
turnable to justices of the peace shall be returned at least
twenty-four hours before the day of trial.
SEC. 1. 1 . When any process is duly served on any
defendant or defendants, and returned to the court to
which it is made returnable, if he or they do not appear,
his or their default shall be recorded, and judgment be
rendered against them, unless he or they shall come into
court, on or before the second day of its session, and
move for a trial ; in which case he or they shall be ad
mitted thereto, upon paying to the plaintiff his cost to
that time ; and the action shall be entered anew for
trial.(2.)
SEC. 12. When the defendant, being an inhabitant
of this state, is absent out of the same, at the time of
the commencement of the suit, and does not return be
fore the first day of the sitting of the court, such suit
shall be continued to the next term ; and if the defend
ant does not return, or appear by attorney, and be so
remote that notice of the suit could not have been con-
veyed to him, such suit may be continued to the next
term and no longer : and if he does not then appear,
judgment may be rendered against him on default of ap
pearance. But if the defendant is not an inhabitant, or
resident of this state, at the commencement of the suit,
and does not appear and answer to the suit, by himself
or attorney, then the court shall continue the same to the
next term, and may direct notice to be given to the defendent
of the pendency of the suit, by publication in
some, newspaper, or otherwise, as they may judge expe
dient : and if the defendant should not then appear, by
himself or attorney, and be so remote that it is not proba
ble that notico has been received by him of the penden
cy of the suit, the court shall continue the suit to the
next term, and no longer ; and if he does not then ap
pear, may render judgment against him, on default. And
in such cases, where judgment shall be entered up against
him on default, after such continuances, execution shall
not issue thereon, until the plaintiff shall have lodged
with the clerk of the court, a bond, with one or more
sufficient sureties, to the adverse party, in double the
sum of such judgment, to refund the whole, or such part
of it, as the court, upon a writ of error, or petition for
a new trial, to be brought within one year after such
judgment, shall adjudge and determine that the plaintiff
had no right to recover : provided, that no real estate
taken by an execution granted on such first judgment,
shall be aliened and conveyed till after the expiration of
twelvemonths from the rendition of such judgment; or
till after a decision in favor of the original plaintiff, upon
a writ of error or petition for a new trial, brought within
twelve months as aforesaid.
SEC. 13. And in every case, where it appears that
the defendant had not actual notice of the suit, or a reasonable
opportunity to appear and make his defence, the
court may, on petition, grant him a new trial, if they
find he had just ground of defence.
SEC. 14. In actions on joint securities, where all the
defendants are not inhabitants of this state, the service of
the process upon such of the defendants as are inhabit
ants of this state, shall be sufficient notice to maintain the
suit against all the defendants. And if any of the de
fendants, on whom the process was not served, shall be
aggrieved by the judgment, he may be relieved by a new
trial, which the court is empowered to grant, upon a pe
tition for the same, if they shall find, that the defendant
has just cause of defence.
SEC. 15. When a suit is brought before a justice of
the peace, against a defendant who is an inhabitant of
the state, but is absent at the commencement of the suit,
and does not return before the trial, such action shall
be adjourned a reasonable time, not less than one month,
nor more than nine months, to give an opportunity for
the defendant to return, or to send notice to him.
SEC. 16. When a suit is brought before a justice of
the peace, against a defendant who is not an inhabitant
or resident of this state, and actual notice is not given to
him, the action shall be adjourned for a term not less
than three, nor more than nine months.
SEC. 17. In all cases where a judgment shall be ren
dered, by a justice of the peace, against a defendant,
who is absent from the state till after the time of the tri
al, and has no notice of the suit, he may apply to the
county court, in the county where the judgment is ren
dered, for a new trial ; which court is empowered to
grant the same, and to proceed to final judgment there
in, if the defendant shall make it appear, that the judg
ment was wrongfully obtained against him, and that he
has a good ground of defence ; which application shall
be made within six months after his return into this state,
and within three years from the rendition of the judgment.
SEC. 18. If the plaintiff, in an action returned to any
court, and entered in the docket, on being called three
times after twelve o'clock on the first day of the sitting
of the court, shall not appear, either by himself or attor
ney, to prosecute the action, he shall be nonsuited, and
pay cost to the defendant, and for entering the action,
as if it had been prosecuted in said court. And the
plaintiff, in all actions brought to any court, shall have
liberty to withdraw the same, or become nonsuit, before
the jury have given in their verdict ; in which case he
shall pay cost to the defendant, and may bring a new
suit; such withdraw or nonsuit having been first re
corded.
SEC. 19. In all actions, brought by any person, who
is not an inhabitant of this state, to any court in this state,
the clerk of such court shall enter in the record of the
cause, the name of the attorney, by whom such stranger
appeared ; which record shall be good evidence, that
such attorney was the lawful attorney of such stranger.
SEC. 20. In any action, where bond for prosecution
is not given at the time of praying out the writ, or where
the bond taken is insufficient, the court, or justice of
the peace, before whom the same is brought, on motion
of the defendant, and on satisfactory proof that the plain
tiff, or his surety, is not able to pay the bill of cost that
may be recovered in the suit, shall order the plaintiff to
give a bond, with sufficient surety, to prosecute bis ac-
tion to effect, and pay all damages in case he make not
his plea good, before proceeding to trial of the same ; and,
if the plaintiff shall neglect or refuse to give such bond, he
shall be nonsuited.
SEC. 21. All suits wherein the title to land is to be V
tried and determined, and all actions of trespass quart
clausumfregit, shall be brought and tried in the county
where the land lies : and all other actions, which may be
brought before the superior or county courts, shall be
brought and tried in that county, where the plaintiff or
defendant dwells, if they, or either of them, are inhab
itants of this state : but if neither of them are inhabitants
of this state, then the action shall be brought and tried in
the county where the defendant is, when the suit is com
menced, or where the estate is, which is attached, if the
defendant is not within this state.
SEC. 22. All actions cognizable by a justice of the
peace, shall be brought and tried in those towns where the
plaintiff or defendant dwells : but if there be no justice of
the peace in either of said towns, who can lawfully try
the cause, then the plaintiff may bring his suit before a
justice of the peace in one of the towns next adjoining to
the place of his abode.
SEC. 23. All causes wherein the title to land is not
concerned, and wherein the debt, trespass, damage or
other matter in demand, does not exceed thirty-five dollars,
shall be heard and determined by a justice of the
peaces provided that in all cases where the sum demand
ed shall exceed seven dollars, except in actions on notes
©r bonds, vouched by two witnesses, and given for money
only, an appeal shall be allowed to the next county court :
and when an appeal shall be allowed by a justice of the
peace, to the county court, the party so appealing, shall
give sufficient bond, with surety, to the adverse party, to
prosecute such appeal to effect, and to answer all dama
ges in case he make not his plea good.
SEC. 24. When any plea shall be made in abatement
of any writ or process, before the superior or county
court, or before a justice of the peace, if it be ruled in
favor of the defendant, the plaintiff shall have liberty to
amend the defect, on paying to the defendant his cost to
that time ; and then to proceed in the same manner as he
might have done, had there been no defect in the writ :
and in case the defendant appeal from a judgment ren-
. dered on a plea in abatement, and shall not make good
his plea, by the judgment of the court to which he ap
peals, he shall be liable to pay cost, and execution shall
issue against him for the same, though the cause shall
finally be decided in his favor.
SEC. 25. No action commenced by a single woman,
who intermarries during the pendency thereof, shall abate
on account of such intermarriage, provided the husband
shall appear in court, and cause such marriage to be sug
gested on the record ; and he may then proceed in the
same manner, as if the suit was commenced after such
intermarriage.
SEC. 26. No writ, pleading, judgment, or any kind of
proceeding in court, or course ofjustice, shall be abated,
suspended, set aside or reversed, for any kind of circum
stantial errors, mistakes or defects, if the person and the
cause may be rightly understood and intended by the
court.
SEC. 27. When any action shall be pending in any
superior or county court, and the plaintiff, before final
judgment, shall die, the same shall not abate, if it might
originally have been prosecuted by his executor or ad
ministrator ; and in such case, the executor or adminis
trator may enter their names in the suit, if they see
cause, and prosecute the same. And if the defendant,
while the action is pending in court, and before final
judgment, shall die, the same shall not abate, if it might
originally have been prosecuted against his executor or
administrator ; and the plaintiff, or his executor or ad
ministrator, may have a writ of scire-facias against the
executor or administrator of such deceased defendant, to
shew cause why judgment should not be rendered against
them ; which being served at least twelve days before
the sitting of the court, to which the same is returnable,
and returned, the action shall proceed to final issue, ac
cording to law.
SEC. 28. In any action pending before a court, if
there be two or more plaintiffs or defendants, and one or

on the record, the action shall proceed.
SEC. 29. The parties shall make their pleas, and join
issue, according to the rules and orders established by the
court; and in case the plaintiff shall refuse to obey the

judgment may be rendered against him upon nihil dicit.
SEC. 30. The general issue of not guilty, owe nothing,
did not assume, and promise, no wrong or disseisin, or
any other general plea proper to the action, whereby the
whole declaration is put in proof, according to the na
ture of the action, may be made by the defendant ;
under which general plea, the defendant shall have lib
erty, on the trial of the cause, to give his title in evidence,
or any special matter in his defence and justification, ac
cording to the nature of the action ; excepting only a dis
charge from the plaintiff,, or his accord, or some special
matter, whereby the defendant, by the act of the plaintiff,
is saved or acquitted from the plaintiff's demand in the
declaration ; provided, that the defendant shall not give
in evidence, under the general issue, any special matter,
which, by the rules of the common law, ought to be plead
ed specially, unless at the time of making his plea, he
gives notice thereof in writing, stating.such special mat
ter. (3)
SEC. 31. It shall be lawful for the defendant, in any
suit, to plead, by special leave of the court, as many sev-
eral matters, by distinct pleas, as he shall think necessary
for his defence. If any such matter or plea shall, upon
demurrer joined, be judged insufficient, cost may be giv
en to the plaintiff, at the discretion of the court, though
the other issue of issues may be decided in favor of the
defendant. If a verdict shall be found, on any issue join
ed in the cause, in favor of the plaintiff, costs shall be al
lowed to him, though on some other issue, the defendant
should be entitled to judgment; unless the court that tried
such issue, shall be of opinion, that the defendant had
probable cause to be plead such matter, which, upon the
issue, has been so found against him. And in actions of
replevin, where the defendant makes avowry, the plain
tiff shall have right to plead double, in the same manner
as the defendant in other cases, and shall be governed by
the same principles.
SEC. 32. Whenever the defendant in any suit upon a
bond, note, or other chose in action, not negotiable, shall
i , . . . -» ,, t \. j • -
plead, or give in evidence the discharge, admission, or
other act of the plaintiff, or any payment made to him, or
transaction whatsoever, between the plaintiff and defendant,
it shall be lawful for the plaintiff to reply, or prove,
as the case may require, an assignment of such chose in
action, and notice thereof given to the defendant ; and on
the same being made to appear, such discharge, admis
sion, payment, or other transaction, shall be no otherwise
available in such suit, in favor of the defendant, than the
same would or ought to be in a court of equity.
SEC. 33. In any action on any note, bond, or other
contract, to which there is a condition annexed, which
condition, and any breach or breaches thereof, are not set
out in the plaintiff's declaration ; and the defendant
having prayed oyer of, and set out, such conditions, pleads
performance thereof, and the plaintiff replies thereto,
setting forth any breach or breaches of such condition,
the defendant may, with leave of court, rejoin as many
several matters, by distinct rejoinders, as he might have
pleaded, had such condition, and breach or breaches
thereof, been set forth in the declaration.
SEC. 34. In all actions, brought for the recovery of a
debt before any court in this state, wherein the plaintiff
lives or resides out of this state, or is a bankrupt, or insol
vent, and where there shall be mutual debts between the
plaintiff and defendant in such action, one debt may be
set off against the other, and such matter may be given in
evidence, under the general issue, or pleaded in bar : but
such matter shall not be given in evidence as aforesaid,
unless notice be given, at the time of pleading, to such
action, of the debt intended to be set off, and on what ac
count it has become due : and no debt, claimed by assign
ment, shall be set off, unless the plaintiff had notice, at
the time of commencement of the action, that such
debt was due to the defendant. And in every action,
wherein the defendant shall claim a set-off as aforesaid,
and it shall appear upon the trial, that the plaintiff in
such action is indebted to the defendant, the court, before
whom the trial shall be, shall give judgment for the de
fendant, to recover the same of the plaintiff, with his cost:
provided, that no justice of the peace shall give judgment
for the recovery of such balance, where the same shall
exceed the sum of thirty-five dollars.
SEC. 35. The. plaintiff may amend any defect, mis
take or informality in the writ or declaration, without
cost, within the three first days of the term of the court
to which it is returnable ; and at any time afterwards, on
the payment of cost, at the discretion of the court ; pro
vided such amendment shall not change the form or
ground of the action: and the defendant shall have rea
sonable time to answer the same. (4)
SEC. 36. The parties respectively, shall have liberty
to amend any defect, mistake, or informality in the plead
ings, or other parts of the records or proceedings. When
either party shall suppose, that in any part of the plead
ings, he has missed the ground of his plea, and that he
can plead a different plea, that will save him in his cause,
he shall have liberty to change such plea, replication or
rejoinder, as the case may be, and plead anew : and the
other party shall have reasonable time to answer the
same. And in all cases when a party amends or alters
any part of the pleadings, or pleads anew, if it shall occa
sion any delay in the trial, or inconvenience to the other
party, he shall be liable to pay cost, at the discretion of
the court. And all courts shall have power to restrain
the amendment and alteration of pleas, so far as may be
necessary to compel the parties to join issue in a reason
able time for trial.
SEC. 37. All actions in the superior and county courts,
where an issue is joined on any matter of fact, shall be
tried by a jury of twelve men of the neighbourhood, qual-
ified, empanneled, and sworn according to law. (5)
SEC. 38. Thecivil authority, select-men, constables and
grand-jurors in the several towns, shall, some time in the
month of January, annually, meet and choose, by ballot,
to serve as jurors in the county and superior courts, in
the county to which such towns belong, such number of
their able and judicious freeholders as is prescribed by
law, each of which shall have a freehold estate, set in the
list at nine dollars or more. There shall be a bor
provided in the several towns, at the cost of the town,
with a lock to it, and lodged in the hands of the townclerk
; and when the jurors are chosen as aforesaid, the
town-clerk shall write each man's name, so nominated, on
a piece of paper by itself, and put the several names, so
written, in the said box, and keep the same, locked, in
his hands, that the said names may be drawn as is hereaf
ter provided.
SEC. 39. At some convenient time before the sit
ting of the aforesaid courts, the clerks of the same shall
summon fifteen jurors to attend such courts, andshallis-
sue warrants directed to either of the constables of the
several towns, or some of them, in the county in which
the court is to be held, to summon and warn so many
able, judicious and lawful freeholders of the town as their
warrant directs, to attend and serve as jurors at such
court; and such constable shall repair to the town-clerk,
and, in his presence, (or in case of his absence) in the
presence of one of the select-men of such town, or a
justice of the peace, draw out of the box aforesaid, the
number his warrant directs him to summon, without see
ing the names he draws'before he draws them ; and shall
then summon for jurors, those men whose names he has
so drawn.
SEC. 40. But if any or all whose names are so drawn,
shall be, at the time, dead, others in his or their room shall
be drawn and summoned as aforesaid. And the constable
shall make timely return of his warrant to the clerk that
issued the same, with an indorsement certifying whom he
has summoned for the purpose aforesaid, on pain of for
feiting to the treasury of the county, a sum not exceeding
five dollars, at the discretion of the judges of the court ;
unless such constable shall seasonably make his excuse
to the acceptance of said court.
SEC. 41. And if any of the jurors, summoned as afore
said, do not appear, or shall, for any cause, be excused:
from attending court, the court may, at their discretion,
from time to time, direct the clerk to issue a warrant or'
warrants, to summon, in manner as aforesaid, additional;
jurors, so as to prevent, as far as may be consistent with,
the convenient dispatch of business, the necessity of fill
ing up the panel of jurors with the names of persons not
designated and summoned as aforesaid.
SEC. 42. The clerks of said courts, respectively, in;
empanneling the jury for the trial of each cause, shall,

or if either party neglect to appoint, the officer may ap
ply to any justice of the peace in the town, (who by law
may judge between them in civil causes,) who shall ap
point one or more appraisers, as the case may require :
which appraisers, being sworn according to law, shall
make an estimate of such land or real estate, according
to its true value, in writing under their hands, or either
two of them, and the same deliver to such officer : who
shall thereupon set out to the creditor, by metes and
bounds, so much of the lands as may be sufficient, at the
appraisal, to pay the debt on the execution, and the law
ful charges, if sufficient, if not, so much as there may be^
to be indorsed in part payment of the execution, accord
ing to its value at its appraisal. (9)

such execution, with his proper indorsement thereon, of
such appraisal, and his proceedings, to be recorded at
length, in the records of the town-clerk, where the lands
or real estate lie ; and he shall have thirty-four cents for
causing the same to be recorded, with additional fees for
his travel : and he shall then return such execution into

such estate, to be delivered at the place of sale, according
to law, and on the failure of the delivery of such estate,

inhabitants of such towns, or any part of them, the judges
of the county court, in the county where the parties be
long, may, at the request of the sheriff, depute and em
power some suitable and indifferent person, to serve and
return such executions : which persons, deputed as afore
said, shall have the same power and authority, in serving
such executions, as sheriffs by law have. And such sher

person, deputed at his request as aforesaid, in the same
manner as for his deputies.

growing due thereon, shall be, by leaving a true and at
tested copy thereof with the cashier, secretary or clerk,
with an attested certificate, by the officer making such
levy, that he levies upon and takes such rights or shares,
to satisfy such execution; and thereupon such officer shall
post the same according to law, and, as in other cases,
shall, at vendue, sell the same, together with such interests,
rents and profits, or so many thereof, as shall be
sufficient to satisfy such execution, or so much thereof as
such rights or shares may produce; and such officer shall
thereupon give to the purchaser, an instrument in writ-
ing, conveying to him such rights or shares ; and shall
also leave with such cashier, secretary or clerk, a true
and attested copy of the execution, and of his return
thereon ; and the purchaser shall thereupon be entitled
to all dividends and stock, and to the same privileges, as
a member of such company or corporation, as such
debtor was entitled to. And whenever any proper offi
cer shall, with a writ of attachment or execution, apply
to such cashier, secretary or clerk, for the purpose of so
attaching or levying upon such rights or shares, the
cashier, secretary or clerk shall furnish him with a certi-
ficate, under his hand, in his official capacity, ascertaining
the number of rights or shares the defendant holds in

shall make a return sufficient on the face of it, if it shall
be denied by the other party, it shall be competent for
the court to enquire into the truth of it, and if they shalf

effect, and pay all damages, and costs the adverse party
may recover against him.
SEC. 3. When the damages demanded do not exceed
thirty-five dollars, the writ shall be returnable to a justice
of the peace ; but if the demand is more than thirty-five
dollars, the writ shall be returnable to the county court.
When a writ is made returnable to a justice of the peace,
the defendant may make avowry, and demand such
damages as he may have sustained : if the damages, de
manded by the avowant, shall not exceed thirty-five dol
lars, and shall be more than seven, such cause shall be
appealable to the next county court, though the demand
in the writ of replevin does not exceed seven dollars ;
and the party appealing shall give bond, with sufficient
surety, to prosecute his appeal to effect, and answer all
damages in case he make not his plea good : if the dam
ages demanded by the avowant shall exceed thirty-five
dollars, then such cause may be removed to the next
county court, in the same manner as when the defend
ant pleads title to land in an action to trespass : Provid
ed, that the avowant shall recover no costs, unless he re
covers more than thirty -five dollars damages. And where
the parties join issue upon a plea of title, such action may
be removed in like manner.

fail to appear, or withdraw, or become non-suit, before
issue joined, then the defendant shall have power to make
a suggestion in the nature of an avowry, stating the inju
ry he has sustained, and his claim for damages, and the
court shall proceed to enquire as on a hearing in dama
ges, and shall render judgment in favor of the defendant,
to recover such sum for the damages he has sustained as
they shall think just, and his costs. And if the plaintiff
shall withdraw, or become non-suit, after issue joined,
and before trial, the court may, in like manner, render
judgment for the defendant to recover the damages he has
sustained.
SEC. 5. When any goods or effects are attached, the
defendant in the suit shall have power to replevy the
same, on giving a bond, with sufficient surety, to the val
ue of the goods and chattels attached, conditioned to pay

in the suit on which such goods and chattels are attached,
shall recover against him ; which writ shall be returned to
the same court? to which the writ on which the estate was.,
attached, is returnable, and lodged with the clerk of such
court, that the bond may be a security to the plaintiff for
the judgment he may recover against the defendant ; and
if the officer serving such writ of replevin, shall fail to
return such writ to such court, without the written con
sent of the party who has attached such property, he
shall be liable to pay such party double damages, in an
action brought against him for such neglect.
SEC. 6. Whenever the rights or shares of any person
or persons, in any bank, insurance company, turnpike
company, or other corporation, shall be attached, it shall
be lawful for him or them to cause the same to be replev
ied, in the same manner as in case of other property
attached : and the officer serving the writ issued in such
case, shall leave a true and attested copy with the cash
ier, clerk or secretary of the bank, insurance company,
turnpike company, or other corporation, the shares or
rights in which have been attached, and such writ shall
be returnable to the same court as the writ by which
such rights or shares were attached, and shall be so re
turned by the officer serving the same, and for his neglect
he shall be liable as in other cases ; and on a copy being
so left, the shares or rights attached shall be released
from the attachment, and the bond in the writ of replevin
shall be a security to the plaintiff in the suit by attach
ment, to recover his debt or damages.
SEC. 7. The person or persons who shall give bond
upon any writ of replevin, shall not be liable to pay any
greater sum, in any suit which may be brought on any
bond, than the value of the property replevied by virtue
of said writ.
SEC. 8. When any goods or chattels shall be attach
ed, and any person, other than the defendant in the suit,
shall claim to be the owner of them, such person shall
have power to replevy the same, on giving bond before
the justice of the peace, or other authority, signing the
writ, with sufficient surety, in a sum equal to the value of
the goods attached, conditioned to prosecute his action
of replevin to effect, and in case he fail to make his plea
good, to return and deliver the goods and chattels at
tached, to the officer attaching the same, so that they
may be forth-coming to be taken by an execution that
may be granted in the suit on which they were attached,
and on failure thereof, to pay the debt or damage that
may be recovered in such suit. And the plaintiff in such
writ of replevin may cite the party, who attached the
goods and chattels ordered to be replevied, to appear
before a proper court, to answer to a charge for unlawful
ly taking the same : and if such plaintiff shall make out
a title to such goods and chattels, he shall have judgment
to retain the same, with his damages and costs ; but if he
shall fail to make out a title, judgment shall be rendered
against him to return such goods and chattels to the ofhV
cer who attached the same, and that, on failure thereof,
he shall pay the value of such goods and chattels, or the
debt or damages and costs, recovered in the action on
which they were attached, in case they exceed in value

ing further notice. And every person prosecuted for re
newing such encroachment, and convicted, shall incur a
