of one chief justice.

shall bold hf11 office for a period or rour year&, and two assoctate jostloos, who shall be selected by a majority or
the justices or the peace of each count{, from among their own body, at tho beginning of each and every year.
It would seem, therefore, that the chle justice, acting ns such, did not and could not constitute the court. and
had no authority to approve the bond or the clerk or tho county court. Ir done by tho court, it should be

§ 1263. [11 Where the subscribing witnesses to a will are in the army,
and beyond the Iimits of the state, said will may be probated on proof by
two witnesses of the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses to said will,
and also of the testator, if be was able to write; which proof may be either
by affidavit taken in open court, and subscribed by the witnesses, or by 
deposition.] 
§ 1264. (1113) [4] No nuncupative will shall be proved within four­
teen days after the death of the testator ; nor until those who would have
been entitled by inheritance, had there been no will, have been cited to con­
test the same, if they please ; nor shall any such will be probated after six
months have elapsed, from the time of speaking the pretended testamentary
words, unless the same or the substance thereof shall have been committed
to writing within six days after making such will ; nor shall any such will be
probated, unless it be made in the time of the last sickness of the deceased,
at his or her habitation, or where he or she hath resided, for ten days next
preceding, except when the deceased is taken sick away from home, and dies
before he or she returns to such habitation ; nor shall any such will be pro­
bated unless it be proved. by three credible witnesses, that the testator
or testatrix called on some person to take notice, or bear testimony that such
is his or her will, or words of like import; and whenever any such will may
be probated, the evidence of the witnesses shall be committed to writing,
sworn to and subscribed, in open court, by witnesses, 'and shall be re­ 
corded by the clerk.

one witness· and the declaratton of the testator, after its date, that It was his will, the proof was held to be in­
sufficient. (Balley v. Styles, 1 Ch. Reports, 2'20; Lonls v, Lewis, 0 Se~t. & R. 489,) Id. It la nee"ssary to 
prove the execution of n will by the formalities and eolemnltles requtred by tho statute, by direct testimony, or
that legally deducible from such. Id. And where direct testlmony cannot be had, or the Cacti! of Uu.'I CH.Se take
It without the statutory rule, reeort may be had, in the first Instance, to such as m11y be aceeeslble and pertinent 
to lhe luue; but the tacts to be establlehed cannot be inferred from proof of others, from which they arc not
naturally and reasonably inferable, All the facts necelll\lU'y for the probate of a will, tr before the court, must 
be proved if the will be lost. Id. The judgment or the probate court, admitting the will to record, cannot be
attacked oollaterally. (Ingram v. Ingram, Dallam, IH9; -Iarman on Wills, 212. 218, 2d Am. ed.; 1 Green!. Ev.

tion, together with a citation, shall be served on the executor or adminis­ 
trator, requiring him to appear at a regular term of the court, and show
cause why a new appraisement should not be made. On the return of such
citation served, the chief justice shall inquire into the truth of the facts
alleged, and, if satisfied that such appraisement was manifestly unjust or
erroneous, shrtll appoint other appraisers, and order a new appraisement, to
be made and returned in like manner as original appraisements. Wben such
new appraisement is made and returned, it shall be recorded, and shall stand 
in place of the original nppraisement, which shall be as if never made: Pro­

§ 1304. (1153) (44] At the first term of the court, after the original
grant of letters testamentary, or of administration, it shall be the duty of the
chief justice to fix the amount of an allowance to be made for the support of
the widow and minor children, if there be either or any, of the deceased,
which allowance shall be of an amount sufficient for their maintenance for
the term of one year, and shall be paid by the executor or administrator to
the widow, if there be one; if not, then to the guardian of the child or chil­
dren, either in money out of the first fonds of the estate that may come to
his hands, or in such personal effects of the deceased as such widow or
guardian may choose to take at the appraisement, or a part thereof in each,
as they may select. If there be no personal effects of the estate that such
widow or guardian are willing to take for such allowance, or not a sufficiency
of them ; and if there be no funds, or not sufficient funds, of the estate in
the hands of such executor or administrator to pay such allowance, or any
part thereof, then it shall be the duty of the chief justice, so soon as the
mventory and list of claims are returned, to order a sale of so much of the
estate, for cash, as will be sufficient to raise the amount of such allowance,
or a part thereof, as the case may require: Provided, however, that when
any such widow and minor children shall have separate property adequate
to their maintenance, then no such allowance shall be made as is provided
for in this section.

justice to set apart, for the use and benefit of the widow and children, if
there be either or any, of the deceased, all such property as may be ex­
empted from execution or forced sale by the constitution or laws of the
state, with the exception of any exemption of one year's supply of pro.
visions ; and in case there should not be among the effects of the deceased,
all or any of the specific articles so exempted, it shall be the duty of the
chief justice to make an allowance in lieu thereof to the widow and children,
or such of them as there be, which allowance shall be paid by the executor
or administrator, either in money out of the first funds of the estate that
may come to his hands, or in any property of the deceased that such widow
or children may choose to take at the appraisement, or a part thereof in
both 'SS they may select. If there be no property of the deceased that such
widow or children are willing to take for such allowance, or not a sufficiency,
and there be no funds, or not sufficient funds of the estate in the hands of
such executor or administrator to pay such allowance, or any part thereof, 
it shall be the duty of the chief justice, on the application of such widow or
children, to order a sale of so much of the estate for cash as will be sufficient
to raise the amount of such allowance, or a Fart thereof, as the case may re­
quire. . Such allowance shall be paid in the following manner : If there be a
widow and no children, the whole to be paid to the widow: If there be a
child, or children, and no widow, the whole to be paid to such child, or to
be equally divided among such children: If there be a widow and a child,
or children, one-half to be paid to the widow, and the other half to such
child, or to be divided equally among such children : Provided, that, if the
estate of such decedent be not insolvent, nothing in this section contained,
shall be so construed as to prohibit the distribution and partition of said
estate among the heirs and distributees thereof, including the portion herein
provided, to be set aside for the use of the widow and children : and,
further :provided, that a year's provision shall be exempted from such
distribution.

for the sale of all the perishable property belonging to tho succession, and all or such portion
of the other personal property, except slaves, as may be shown to the court to be necessary for
the payment of debts against said estate; and in case, or if on further information, he finds
that the proceeds of the sale of the personal property will not be sufficient for the payment <:I
the said debts, he shall then, within six months after his appointment, or as soon as be ascer­
tains the said deficiency, petition the probate court for the sale of the slaves and real est.at~ o( 
the decedent, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of the said debts ; and
the said court, on full and satisfactory proof of the existence of the debts, and the necessity of
the sale, shall order the same on CMh or credit, as may be most advantageous to said estate. or 
as the nature of the claims against said estate may require. 
A.RT, (1024.) (30] Should the executor or administrator fail to petition the court for the sale
of property, as directed by the above section of this act, then it may be lawful for any one of
tho creditors of the said estate, whose claims have been acknowledged or established, to peti­

that a boA4 _'/Id, purchaller at an administrator's ale, made In pnrananoe of IID order, which the court had the

made to avoid expenses incidental to the preservation of personal property, and for taxes, are
hereby lei\ to the discretion of the judge. The land, and slaves, and other property, shall, in 
all cases, upon a proper showing by the heirs, be, for their benefit, kept together, without sale
or hiring, when a sale thereof is not absolutely necessary.

§ 132'1. (11 '16) [67] When a sale of property is ordered under the

make such sale, or cause it to be made in obedience to the order, at the
earliest period; and when such sale has been made, it shall be the duty of
the executor or administrator, to return to the court that ordered the sale,
an account thereof--either in term time or vacation-within thirty days after
the day of sale. Such account of sale shall be in writing, shall specify the
property sold, the name of the purchaser, the price for which it was sold, and
tbe terms of sale, and shall be sworn to and subscribed by such executor or
administrator, before some officer authorized to administer oaths; whenever
such account of sale is returned, such return shall be noted in the minutes of
the court, and at the term of the court when it is returned ; or if returned in
vacation, at the first term thereafter, it shall be the duty of the chief justice
to inquire into the manner in which such sale was made; and if satisfied that
it was fairly made, and in confonnity with law, he shall cause to be entered

such decree of confirmation shall have been made, upon the purchaser com­
plying with the terms of sale, the executor or administrator shall execute
and deliver to him a conveyance of the propertr so sold, if it were either land
or slaves, reciting therein the decree confirming the sale, and ordesing the
conveyance to be made, which conveyance of land or slaves so made, shall
vest the right and title that the testator or intestate bad, in the purchaser,
and shall be prima facie evidence that all the requisites of the law have been
complied with in making the sale ; and such decree of confirmation of the
sale of personal property, other than slaves, shall in like manner vest the right
and title thereof in the purchaser, and shall be Jike evidence that all the
requisites of the law have been complied with in making the sale of such per­

was entitled to nominal damages, and to such Immediate special dam~e8 as be could prove, An,l if the admin­

is not specially directed by the will of the testator, or by the provisions of
this act, or if the same is not required to be at once sold for the payment of
debts, or claims of any kind against the estate, it shall be the duty of the
executor or administrator to apply to the chief justice for an order to carry

justice shall appear most for the interest of the estate,-and to hire or rent
such other property. Such order shall be entered on the minutes of the court;

prevent an executor or administrator, when the estate is not indebted,-or only to a small

§ (983.) ra] All proceedings relative to successions, matters of probate, et catera, shall
be regulated and governed agreeably to the principles and laws in similar cases in the state
of Louisiana: Provided, that no judge shall act as administrator; but in all cases of intestacy,
the next of kin, and other principles of the common law, shall prevail in the appointment of ud­ 
ministrators and guardians. And the judges shall proceed to complete all unfinished business 
which remains on file or of record, of their predecessors, under tho laws of Coahulla and Texas,
including all appeals which have been taken from their respective municipalities to the supreme
court, the records of which shall be returned to the courts of their respective municipalities, and 
trials thereon be had <k noro: Provided, that in all cases where new municipalities have been
cr~ated, taken from one or more municipalities, it shall be the duty of the clerk of tho court of 
the old municipality to transmit all original papers, documents, and transcripts of proceedings 
had in each case or suit, and all original papers and proceedings relative to successions,
testamentary business of every kind, and all unfinished business and proceedings whatever,
belonging to or connected with the citizens of the new municipality, to the clerk of the court of

By the ctvil code of Louisiana (In force prior to the act or 1886), the succession was required to be closed within

duties, but the original bona of such executor, or administrator, shall be deemed and held as
euffl<,ient, and binding, until the final settlement of the estate, except in cases where new
security is specially required by the existing probate laws. 
The act otl840 only repeals all laWB, and parts of laws, conflicting with the act. Murphy v. Menard, 115

ABT. 1358. {1206) [97] .At the return term of any such citation as is pro­
vided for in the preceding section, or at some succeeding term to which the
application may be continued by the court, if it shall appear that such citation
has been served and published as required by law, the court shall proceed to 
ascertain who are the persons, by law, entitled to partition and distribution,
and their respective shares; and if there are any persons so entitled, who are
known, and are minors, and have no guardian in this state, or whose
guardians are also entitled to a portion of such estate, the court shall appoint
a guardian, ad litem, to represent them in the partition of the estate ; and if
there are any persons so entitled, who are not known, or not residents of this
state, and no person appears who is authorized to represent them, the court 
shall appoint an attorney to represent them in the partition of the estate ;
after which, the court shall proceed to ascertain whether advancements have
been made to any of the persons so entitled-their nature and value-and
require the same to be placed in hotchpotch; as reguired by the law govern­
ing descents and distribution ; and also to ascertain what estate is liable to
partition and distribution ; the court shall then enter a decree, which shall
state the name and residence, if known, of each person entitled to a share of
the estate-specifying those who are known to be minors-the name of their
guardian or guardians ad litem-the name of the attorney appointed to 
represent those who are unknown, or are not residents of this state; the
decree shall also state the proportional part of the estate to which each is
entitled; and shall contain a full description of all the estate to be distributed ;
if the estate to be distributed shall consist only of money, or debts due the
estate, or both, the court shall fix the amount to which each is entitled, and
order the payment and delivery thereof by the executor or administrator ;
but if the estate do not consist entirely of money or debts due the estate, or
both, the court shall appoint three or more discreet persons as commissioners
to make s partition and distribution of the estate, and shall order a writ of
partition to issue, commanding them to proceed forthwith to makesuch par-.
tition and distribution, in accordance with the decree of the court, a copy of
which shall accompany such writ ; and, also, commanding them to make due
return of said writ-with their proceedings under it-at some term of the
conrt to be named in the writ. 
§ 1859. (1207) [98] Itsbnll be the duty of the commissioners of par­
tition under this act, to make a fair, just, and impartial partition and distri­
bution of the estate in the following order :-1st. Of the land or other real
estate, by allotment to each distributee of a part in each parcel, or of parts in
one or more parcels, or of one or more parcels either with or without the
addition of a part or parts of other parcels, as shall be most for the interest
of the distributees : Provided, the said real estate is caeable of being so
divided without manifest injury to all or any of the distributees. And the
said commissioners shall have power, if they think it necessary, to call to their
aid one or more well qualified surveyors to run the lines of any lands :md also
divisional lines thereof. If the real estate is not capable of a fair, just, and
equal division, in kind, but may be made so, by allotting to one or more of
the dlstributees a proportion of money or negroes, or other personal property,
to supply the deficiency or deficiencies, the commissioners shall have power
to make, as near as may be, an equal division of the real estate, and supply
the deficiency of any share or shares from the money, negroes, or other
property. The commissioners shall proceed to make a like division in kind,
as near as may be, of the negroes-supplying the deficiency of any share or
shares from the money or other property ; and also a like division of the
money and other personal property, and shall determine by lot, among equal
ebares, to whom each particular share shall belong. 
§ 1360. (1208) [99] When, in the opinion of the commissioners, the
whole, or any portion of any estate, is not capable of a fair and equal di vision
among the distributees, the said commissioners shall make a special return 
of such property to the court, with the value thereof duly appraised by them.
Upon such return being made to the court, any one or more of the dis­ 
tributees, at a regular term of the court, by the payment to the executor or­
administrator of the appraised value of the property so returned as incapable
of division ; or on the execution of his or their obligations, with one or more
good and sufficient sureties, in favor of each of the other distribntees, for their
share of the appraised value of such property, payable at such time, not,
exceeding twelve months from the date thereof, as the court may designate :
Provided, the court may think it, for the interest of the distributees to allow
a credit; shall have the right to take the said property. Should any one or
more of the distributees take the said property as aforesaid, it shall be the
duty of the court to enter a decree stating the facts ; and on the entry of
such decree the property shall vest as fully and absolutely in the person or
persons taking the same as the deceased was vested therewith : Provided,
nevertheless, that when obligations are executed as aforesaid, a. lieu shall
exist U{>On such property by operation oflaw, to secure the payment of such
obligations: Provided, also, that if any of the distributees shall file in the
court, his exception to the appralsement of the commissioners, before any of 
the distributees shall have so taken such property, a new appraisement
of said property shall be made by order of the court. If no distributee take 
the said property as aforesaid, the court shall order the sale of said,roperty,
either for cash, or on a credit, as may be most for the interest o the die­
tributees ; and at such sale, if any distributee shall bid off any of said
property, be shall be required to pay or secure, as the case may be, only
such amount of his bid as may exceed the amount of his share of such
property ; and the proceeds of sale, when collected, shall be distributed by
the court among those entitled thereto.

divided by them ; and also a particular description of the property allotted 
to each distributee, and its value. And if it be real estate that has been
divided, said report shall contain a general plat of such land, with the
divisional lines plainly set down, and the number of acres in each share.
Upon the return of such report, it shall be the d ut1, of the court, at some
regular term, to examine said report carefully ; and if it be merely informal,
to cause said informality to be corrected : and if such division shall appear
to have been fairly made according to law, and no valid exceptions are taken
to it, the court shall approve it, and order it to be recorded ; but if said
division shall not appear to have been so made, or any valid exceptions are
taken to it, the court shall set aside said report and division, and order
a new partition to be made.

vantageous to the distributees, order a sale thereof for cash, or on a credit
of not more than twelve months, at his discretion: and when the proceeds
of such sale shall have been collected, they shall be distributed, by him,
among those entitled thereto; but if no such proof be made, three or more
commissioners may be appointed in each county where any portion of the

such letters were granted, for a partition of such common property ; and if
he or she shall execute and deliver to said chief justice an obligation, with
good and sufficient sureties, payable to, and approved by said chief justice,
for an amount equal to the value of hia or her interest in such common
property, conditioned for the payment of one-half of all debts existing against
such common property ; then the chief justice shall proceed to make a par-
tition of said common property into two equal moieties-one to be delivered
to the survivor, and the other to the executor or administrator of the de­
ceased ; and all the provisions of this act respecting the partition and distri­
bution of estates, shall apply to any partition made under the provisions of
this section, so far as the same may be applicable ; and whenever such par­

secure the payment of the obligation he may have given as aforesaid ; and
until a partition shall be applied for as herein provided, the executor or ad­
ministrator of the deceased shall have the right, and it shall be his duty, 
to recover possession of all of such common property, and hold the same in 
trust, to be administered for the benefit of t~e creditors and others entitled
thereto under the provisions of this act. Aft.er such partition, any creditor
of said common propPt-ty may sue in his own name on such obligation, and
shall have judgment thereon fur the one-half of such debt as he may estab­
lish ; and for the other half he shall be entitled to be paid by the executor 
or administrator of the deceased.

ABT. 1371. [I] From [and] after the pnssage of this act, the llOth section
of the above recited net shall read as follows:- 
Any person capable of making a will, may so provide by his or her will, 
that no other action shall be had in the county court in relation to the settle­
ment of his or her estate, than the probating and registration of his or her 
will, and the return of an inventory of the estate; and in all such cases, any
person having a debt or claim against said estate, may enforce the payment
of the same, by suit against the executor of said will; and, when judgment
is recovered against such executor, the execution shall run against the estate
of such testator in the hands of such executor: Provided, that no such
executor shall be required to plead to any suit brought against him for
money, until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the probate of 
such will. But in cases where no bond and security has been required of
such executor, at the time of the probate of such will, any person having a
debt [ claim ,,r demand, to which oath has been made] agsmst said estate, or
any person having an interest therein, whether in person or as representative
of another, may by complaint in writing, filed in the court where such will 
was probated, cause such executor to be cited to appear before such court, at
some regular term, and on making it appear to the satisfaction of said court,
that such executor is wasting said estate [ or that such executor is insolvent
or in failing circumstances], and that thereby said creditor will probably
lose his debt, or such other person bis or her interest in the estate, he 
may have an order of said court ordering such executor to give bond, with
two or more good and sufficient sureties, for an amount equal to double the
foll value of such estate, to be approved by, and payable to the [ chief justioe]
of the county; conditioned, that said executor will well and truly administer
such estate, and that be will not waste or mismanage ( or misapply] the same;
which bond may be recovered upon as other bonds given by executors and
administrators; and should such executor fail to give such bond, within ten
days after the order requiring him so to do, then \t shall be the duty of such 
[ chief justice] to remove him from the administration of such estate, and ap·
point some competent person in his stead, whose duty it shall be to adminis­

with two or more good and sufficient sureties, in double the amount of the
value of said estate ; conditioned, payable, and recoverable upon as the bond
required of such executor.]

§ (J 219.) (110) Any person capable of making a will, may so provide by his will, that 
no other action shall be had in the county court, in relation to the settlement of his estate, than
the probate and registration of his will, and the return of an inventory of the estate; but in nll
such cases, any person haviug a debt against said estate may, by complaint in writing, filed in
the court where such will was proved, cause all tho persons entitled to nny portion of such 
eatate under the wll, or as heirs at law, to be cited to appear before such court at some regular 
term, and execute an obligation, with two or more good and suflicient sureties, for an amount
equal to the full value of such estate to be ascertained by the inventory; such obligation to be 
payable to tho chief justice, and conditioned that tho persons who execute the oblient ion shall 
pay all debts that may be established against such estate, in the manner herein provi.ied ; nnd 
on the return of such citations served, unless such persons so entitled to any portiou of tho 
estate, or some of them, or some other persons tor them, shall execute such obligation to the 
satisfa~tion of the chief justice, such estate shall be sr-ttk-d under the direction or th« court, n~
other estates are required to be settled; but if !'11d1 oblignt ion shall l o executed, it slu.l! bo

next of kin of' snch deceased soldier, authorizing him to take administration. 
§ 1402. [3] When administration has heretofore been granted on the
estates of deceased soldiers, without the authority contemplated by this act,
it shall not be lawful for such administrator to recei ve from any officer of the
state, or other person, any patent or land claim, money, or evidence of debt,
to which such deceased soldier may have been entitled, nor to sell the lands,
or land claims of such deceased, without the consent of the heirs of such de­

recorded in the court granting the order to sell, before such order is made. 
§ 1403. [ 4] In all cases where administration has been granted on
estates of deceased soldiers, without the authority contemplated Ly this act,
it shall be the duty of the chief justices of the county courts grantiug the
same, to cause the administrators to be notified, as in other cases, to file in the
court the authority or consent aforesaid ; and in case of failure so to do, they
shall order the removal of such administrators, and also, to require them to

submit questions df fact solely to the decision of the jury, deciding on and
instructing them as to the law arising on the facts-distinctly separating
questions of law from questions of fact. He shall not charge, or instruct the 
Jury in any case, unless the charge shall have been by him first reduced to
writing, and signed; and every such charge or instruction shall be given in
the precise words in which it shall have been written. .All charges or

their testator, or intestate, or ancestor, when a verdict shall be given against
them, or judgment final, by default, shall be taken against them, the judg­

be, and costs, to be paid in due course of administration ; and no execution
shall issue on such judgment. \Vhen the suit is instituted for the enforce­
ment of a specific lien on personal property, the judgment sbaH be, that the
plaintiff recover his debt and damages and costs, and that the property sub­ 
ject to Ruch lien shall be seized and sold by the sheriff, if it can be found,
and that the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the judgment and costs,
and if there be any excess, after such payment, the same shall be paid to the
defendant; and if the proceeds of such sale shall be insufficient to pay such 
judgments and costs, the balance shall be paid in due course of adminis­
tration ; but no execution shall issue thereon. Where the suit is for the
foreclosure of a mortgage on real estate or negroes, the heirs interested in
the mortgaged property shall be made parties to the suit, by due notice

the infant defendanta and the plalntUI', and this charge was not sustained by proofs, there was an end or the 
review, except aa to the alleged nullity or the Judgment for want or 11Cn1ce.. Id. Where a part of the papen 1n
the cause had been lost, and one of the defendants had been made sneh by amended petition, and the record 
reetted that the partle11 appeared by their attorneys, this la prlmafitcie evidence that the party, whom the record
does not show to have been served, did appear and submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court, upon tho trial.
(Merritt v. Clow, 2 TeL t>S2.) Id. And a further recitation, that the defendants moved for a new trial, and there

taken from the district court to the supreme court, the clerk of the district
court shall immediately make up a foll and perfect record of all proceedings 
in such case, and shall, on application of either party, give to such party an

and the day on which it is deli vered, and sign his name, as clerk, thereto;
and if, hy reason of delay or neglect of any clerk to give a transcript of the

any such petition, the clerk shall issue a citation, directed to the sheriff of
the county where the opposite party is alleged to reside, together with a
copy of the petition, commanding him to cite such party to be and appear
before the supreme court, at its next term after the citation is issued, and
defend said writ; which citation and copy of petition shall be served by the
sheriff to whom it is directed, and shall be returned to the court from which
it issued; and all such citations shall be returnable in thirty days after the
issuing thereof; and if the party is a non-resident of the state, or cannot be
found, the citation may be served on the attorney of record ; if an7 such
citation shall not be served, the clerk shall issue an alias, or pluriea citation,
forthwith. Upon the return of any such citation served, the clerk shall
immediately make out a complete transcript of all the proceedings in the
suit upon which the writ is obtained, and also the petition for the writ of
error, and the citation issued with the return thereon, and deliver it to either
party on application, and under the same rules and penalties as provided in
case of appeals: no such writ of error shall operate as a eupereedeas, nor
shall a supereedeas issue with any such writ, until the party obtaining the
same shall have filed with the clerk issuing such writ of error, his obligation,
with good and sufficieut security, to be approved by the clerk, payable to the
adverse party, in a sum equal to double the value or amount of the judg­
ment, order, or decree upon which the writ of error is obtained, conditioned
that the party obtaining such writ shall comply with the judgment, order, or
decree of the supreme court upon such writ, and well and, tr2ly pay all such 
damages as may be awarded against him; which bond snau have the force
and effect of a judgment against all the obligors, upon which execution may

the officer wo.11ted the goods, or thnt tbey were lost or destroyed through bis fault, or that he misapplied tho pro­
ceeds of the sale, or that he retained the same, and did not return tho execution. Id. No such conclusion fiow1
from a levy or an execntton on land. because the o.cts of the officer, without a so.lo, OCC411lon no lose to the debtor,
and the creditor go.Ins nothing, aa the title and possession remain unchanged. (Shepard "· Rowe. 14 Wend. 460;
Taylor v. Ranney. 4 Hill, 621; Reynolds v. Rogers, 6 O. \74.) Id. Levy of an execution, even If made on per· 
aonal property sufflclen& to satisfy the execution, does not extinguish the judgment, tr the loyy ls overreached
by a prior lien, or If lt Is o.bl\ndoned at the request of the debtor, or for his benefit, or if it ls defeated by bis ml1-

fourth day of the term of the court, the plaintiff may, at any time, after said
fourth day, have a final judgment against the defendant; and if the cause of
action is liquidated and proved by any instrument in writing, the clerk shall,
unless a jury is asked for by either party, assess the damages of the plaintiff;
but if the cause of action is unliquiduted, a jury shall be sworn to assess the
damages of the plaintiff: Provided, however, that in suits when service of
the process has been made by publieation, no such judgment by default shall
be taken at the term of the court to which such process is returnable; but
all such suits shall be continued until toe next term of the court, when final 
judgment by default may be taken as in other cases : and provided, also, in

AN AOT FURTHER REGULA.TING PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURTS. 
AnT. 1513. [I] In any county where by law the term of the district court
is limited to one week, if the defendant in any case has been personally
served according to law (except in cases brought up from the courts of jus­
tices of the peace), and shall fail to answer before the fourth day of the term
of the court to which he hns been cited, the plaintitf on or after the fourth
day of the term, may have final judgment by default against the defendant.
If the cause of action be liquidated and established by an instrument in wri­ 
ting, the clerk may compute the sum due, or it may be found by a jury, if 
askecl for by either party. If the cause of action be W1liqnidated, a jury
shall be impanelled to find the sum which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. 
§ 1514. [2] Where suit is instituted against a partnership, service or
process upon one of the partners shall be sufficient nonce to all the members
of the firm, except that the judgment rendered in case of such service, shall
only be enforced against the partnership property, and the separate property 
of the partner who may have been served. 
59'7. Whether, after taking Judgment anlnst one of the partners. tho \llalntltf can mali:itatn nn nction
upon the note. o.s the joint contract or the firm, ls a questlon on which there ba8 seen some dlversitv of decision. 
But the great weight of authority seems to be ngnlnst a !It-Coll(}. recovery upon the contract, (Collyer 011 Part­

Where \he plaintiff' takes judgment upon the note against the partner who sizned it lndividun.lly, equity will not
a,ld to subject tho partner11hlp property to the payment or that jndgment, (Penny v. Martin, 4 J•,hns. Ch. 666;

111. 66. The dormant partners should be ascertulncd, and joined In the ori:.dn:il snit. Id, It ill a well settled
doctrine in equity, that every partnership debt Is joint and several ; and therefore tbe creditor may, nt any time,
sue the survivor u such, and proceed rui:alnst the estate or the deceased partner. (Collyer on Part. 4th Am. 
from 2d Ellf[, edit. p, 6M, IIM, n.; 3 Kent. 63. 64 n.; 1 Story's Eq. 7ti.) Ill. Ir II plaintiff would proceed 11,irainat
the estate of a deceased partner, he must pursue the mo<le required by law for the settlement or the estate or
deceased pel'!lons. Id. M. The court will not take tho property out of the hands of the survivlng partner and 
executor, and place It In the hands of receivers, upon a qu<Uli cn·ditor's bill. Id. 46. 
§ 1515. p I] In civil suits, each party shall be entitled to challenge

[ AN ACT AMENDING THE SEVERAL ACTS REGULATING PROCEEDINGS IN THE
DISTRICT COURTS. 
§ 1518. [1] All corporations acting under a charter granted bv the
legislature of this state, in all suits, whether as plaintiffs or defendants, \:hall

length. 
AGREED CASE. 
ABT. 1516. [12) After trial of any cause, when either party intends to
remove the same into the supreme court for revision, the parties may, with
the consent and approval of the judge who tried tho cause, and without the
necessity of copying the entire proceedings, agree upon such a statement of
the case, and the facts proven, if any, as in their opinion will be uecessarv to
show whether there has been any error in the proceedings ; and such state-
ment shall be signed by the attorneys of the parties, and certified by the
judge, and filed as a part of the record of the cause ; and a copy of such
statement and of the judgment in the case, and the assignment of errors
certified by the clerks of the court, shall be a sufficient transcript of the
proceedings to be taken to the supreme court, and to entitle the parties to a
trial therein upon the points presented for revision. In all cases proposed
to be removed to the supreme court, where such agreed statement is not
made, approved, and filed, as in this section provided, the clerks shall make
out and send up the full transcript of the proceedings as is now provided by
law. 
§ 151'7. [13] No writ of error to remove a cause from the district to
the supreme court, shall in any case issue unless the plaintiff in error give
bond, with sufficient security for all the costs which may accrue in the supreme
court, and which may have accrued in the district court.
