papers, and keep the same safely until the appointment of
an assignee; to publish notice in such newspapers as the

meeting; and all debts at that time absolutely due, although
not payable, may be proved and allowed as if payable, with
a discount or rebate of interest when no interest is payable
by the contract. Moneys due on any bottomry or respondentia bond or policy of insurance may be proved ‘and
allowed, if the contingency or loss happens before the
making of the first dividend, in like manner as if the
same had happened before the first publication of the
notice. If the debtor is liable for any debt in consequence
of having made or indorsed a bill of exchange or promissory
note before said first publication, or in consequence of the
payment by any party to a bill or note of any part of the
money secured thereby, or of the payment of any sum by
a surety of the debtor in any contract, if the payment be
made before the making of the first dividend, such debt
may be proved and allowed as if it had been due and
payable by the debtor before the first publication. All
demands against the debtor for or on account of goods or
chattels wrongfully obtained, taken, or withheld, by him,
may be proved and allowed as debts, to the amount of the
value thereof. No debt other than those above mentioned
shall be proved or allowed against the estate.

SECT. 27. If it appears that there has been mutual

credit given by the debtor and any other person, or mutual

debts between them, the account between them shall be
stated, and one debt set off against the other, and the
balance shall be allowed or paid on either side.

of real or personal estate of the debtor, or a lien thereon,
for securing the payment of a debt claimed by him, the

property so held as security shall, if he require it, be sold,
and the proceeds applied towards the payment of his debt,
and he shall be admitted as a creditor for the residue
thereof, if any. The sale shall be made in such manner
as the judge shall order, and the creditor and assignee
respectively shall execute all deeds and papers necessary or
proper for effecting the conveyance. If the creditor shall
not require such sale and join in effecting the conveyance, he may release and deliver up to the assignee the
premises held as security and be admitted as a creditor
for the whole of his debt. If the property shall not be so
sold, or released and delivered up, the creditor shall not be
allowed to prove any part of his debt.

SECT. 29. N o debt shall be proved or allowed unless the
creditor, or if he resides in a foreign country and the debt
is founded on a contract made by the debtor with the consignee or agent of the creditor residing in the United

as follows :I, , do swear that , of , by (or against,) whom
proceedings in insolvency have been instituted, at and before the date of

any other person to my use, to m knowle or belief, received any
securi or satisfaction whatever, yond w at has been disposed of
agreea ly to law. And I do further swear, that said claim was not
procured b me for the purpose of influencing the proceedings in this
case. An I do further swear that I have not, directly or indirectly,

or made or entered into any bargain, arrangement, or agreement, express
or implied, to take or receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property,
or consideration, whatsoever, to myself, or to any person or persons to my
use or benelit, under or with any understanding or agreement, express or
implied, whereby m vote for assignee or my assent to the debtor's discharge is or shall he in any _way affected, influenced, or controlled, or

whereby the proceedings in this case are or shall be affected, influenced,
or controlled.

No claim shall be allowed unless all the statements set
forth in the oath are true.

SECT. 30. If the creditor is disabled by absence from
the state, sickness, or other cause, from proving his claim,
the above oath may be made by an agent or attorney of
the creditor testifying to the best of his knowledge and
belief; in which case the judge may require such further

proof of the truth of the statements therein as he shall
deem expedient.

SE01‘. 31. The oath may be made before a justice of the
peace; but the judge may at any time require the personal

dividend thereon.

and shall cause a list thereof to be made and certified by E
the register; and any creditor may act at all meetings by his j?
duly constituted attorney_ the same as though personally;
present.

wholly or in part rejected, or an assignee who is dissatisfied 7
with the allowance of a claim, may appeal from the decision ; :
but no appeal shall be allowed unless it is claimed and notice ;

the proceedings, and also to the assignee or creditor, as the J
case may be, within ten days after the decision ‘appealed i
from. If the debt demanded exceeds three hundred dollars 1
the appeal shall be to the supreme judicial court, otherwise
to the court of common pleas, or in the county of Suffolk
to thesuperior court. The appeal shall be entered in the

or answer thereto in like manner; and like proceedings
shall be thereupon had in the pleadings, trial, and determination of the cause, as in an action at law commenced and
prosecuted in the usual manner; except that no execution
shall be awarded against the assignee for the amount of a
debt found due to the creditor. .,

provided, that when the number of creditors present shall

amount to five and less than fen, the votes of two at least, ‘

and when the number of creditors shall amount to ten or
more, the votes of three at least, shall be necessary for a
choice. If no choice is made by the creditors at said meeting, the judge shall appoint one or more assignees. If an
assignee so chosen or appointed shall, within four days, fail
to express in writing his acceptance of the trust, the judge
may fill the vacancy.

SECT. 40. All elections of assignee shall be subject to

SECT. 44. The assignee shall forthwith cause the assign- a
ment to be recorded in the registry of deeds in each district 
or county in which there may be real estate of the debtor 4
on which it may operate; and shall give such public notice
of his appointment as the judge shall order.

SECT. 45. The assignment shall vest in the assignee all 5
the property of the debtor real and personal which he could f
have lawfully sold, assigned, or conveyed, or which might 1
have been taken on execution upon a judgment against him, f
at the time of the first publication of the notice of issuing the ‘
warrant, although the same may then be attached on mesne 1
process as the property of the debtor; and shall be effectual T
to pass all said estate and, subject to the provisions of ;

SECT. 46. If a debtor whose property has been attached, i
shall before judgment and execution in_ the suit convey any 3
part of such property, and subsequently thereto and before i
execution issues proceedings are commenced by or against §
him as an insolvent debtor, or if a dissolution of an attach- 
ment under the preceding section might prevent the property -.
attached from passing to the assignee, the judge before whom
proceedings in insolvency are pending, or the court to which
the process of attachment is returnable, may upon application made on or before the day of the third meeting of
creditors by any person interested, and cause shown thereon,
order the lien created by the attachment to continue. The
action may be continued or executién staid until the assignee

is chosen and takes charge of the action. The assignee may
proceed with the action and levy the execution at the cost
and expense of the estate; and the amount recovered exclusive of costs shall vest‘in the assignee.

' SECT. 47. The assignee shall demand and receive from
the messenger and all other persons, all the estate in his or
their possession which shall have been assigned or intended
to be assigned under the provisions of this chapter; and he
shall sell all such estate, real and personal, which shall
come to his hands, on such terms as he shall think most
for the interest of the creditors; and shall keep a regular
account of all moneys received by him as assignee, to which
every creditor shall at reasonable times have free resort.

SECT. 48. He shall have the like remedy to recover all
said estate, debts, and effects, in his own name, as the debtor
might have done if no assignment had been made. If at
the time of the assignment an action shall be pending in
the name of the debtor for the recovery of a debt or other
thing which might or ought to pass to the assignee by the
assignment, the assignee shall, if he requires it, be admitted
to prosecute the action in his own name, in like manner and
with like effect as if it had been originally commenced by
him. No suit pending in the name of the assignee shall be
abated by his death or removal; but upon the motion of the
surviving, remaining, or new assignee, as the case may be,
he shall be admitted to prosecute the suit in like manner
and with like effect as if it had been originally commenced
by him. In suits prosecuted by the assignee, the assignment made by the judge shall be conclusive evidence of his
authority to sue.

SECT. 49. Drafts, bills of exchange, promissory notes,
claims, demands, and causes of action, which shall, subsequently to the sixth ‘day of July in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-six, and within six months before the filing of
the petition by or against a debtor, have been assigned,
transferred, conveyed, or delivered, to any person indebted
or liable to the debtor, shall not be offset or pleadable in
defence in any suit by the assignee to recover such debt
or liability ; but the assignee may recover the same notwithstanding such draft, bill of exchange, promissory note, claim,
demand, or cause of action: provided, that the person to
whom the same shall be so assigned, transferred, conveyed,
or delivered, had at the time of such assignment, transfer,
conveyance, or delivery, reasonable cause to believe the
debtor insolvent.

SECT. 50. The assignee shall as soon as may be after
receiving any money belonging to the estate, deposit the

same in some bank, in his name as assignee, or otherwise
keep it distinct and apart from all other moneys in his
possession; and shall as far as practicable keep all goods
and effects belonging to the estate separate and apart from
all other goods in his possession, or designated by appropriate marks ; so that they may be easily and clearly distinguished and may not be exposed or liable to be taken as his
property or for the payment of his debts.

SE01‘. 51. He shall give written notice to all creditors
by mail or otherwise of all dividends; and such notice of
all meetings after the first as the judge shall order.

S1301‘. 52. He shall be allowed, and may retain out of the
moneys in his hands, all the necessary disbursements made
by him in the discharge of his duty, and a reasonable compensation for his services, in the discretion of the judge.

S1':c'r. 53. He may under the direction of the judge,
submit any controversy that shall arise in the settlement of
demands against the estate or of debts due to it, to the
determination of arbitrators, to be chosen by him and the
other party to the controversy; and may under such direction compound and settle any such controversy by agreement with the other party as he shall think proper and most
for the interest of the creditors.

SECT. 54. When it shall appear to the satisfaction of the
judge that the title to any portion of an estate which has
come into possession of the assignee is in dispute, and that
the property is of a perishable nature or liable to deteriorate in value, he may on the petition of the assignee and
after such notice to the claimant, his agent, or attorney, as
the judge shall deem reasonable, order it to be sold under
the direction -of the assignee, who shall hold the funds
received, in place of the estate disposed of; and the proceeds of the sale shall be considered the measure of the
value of the property in any suit or controversy between
the parties. But this provision shall not prevent the recov‘ery of the property from the possession of the assignee by

action of replevin commenced at any time before the judge
orders the sale.

SECT. 55. When an assignee has received from the estate
assets suflicient to pay fifty per cent. of the debts and claims
proved against it, he shall certify the fact and render his
accounts therefor to the judge; and when he has received
twenty-live per cent. more from the assets, he shall in like
manner certify and render his accounts therefor. He shall
also certify and render his accounts at any time when
required by the judge.

SECT. 56. At a meeting called by order of the judge in

; his discretion for the purpose, and which shall be called

upon the application of a majority of the creditors either
in number or value, the creditors may remove any assignee
by such a vote as is provided in section thirty-nine for the

choice of assignees.

SECT. 57. The judge after due notice and hearing may
remove an assignee if it shall appear to him upon the
complaint of any person interested in the estate that the
assignee has fraudulently received, concealed, embezzled, or
conveyed away, any of the money, goods, effects, or other
estate, of the debtor, or has been interested in any suit at
law in relation to said estate for the purpose of securing to
himself a preference or priority over the other creditors, or
has in his possession or control any portion of the estate
with intent to appropriate the same unlawfully to his own
use, or has been guilty of any fraudulent act in relation to

the same.

Sncr. 58. He may also remove an assignee who having
removed from the state unreasonably refuses or neglects
to obey any lawful order for calling meetings of the creditors, to settle his accounts, or otherwise unreasonably refuses
or neglects to discharge his duties; and for any other cause
which shall in his judgment render such removal necessary

or expedient.

SEC-T. 59. An assignee may resign his trust and be
discharged therefrom, if the judge shall accept his resignation.

SECT. 60. Vacancies caused by death or otherwise in
the ofiice of assignee may be filled by appointment of the
judge, or at his discretion by an election of the creditors in
the manner prescribed in section thirty-nine at a regular
meeting, or at a meeting called for the purpose, with such
notice thereof in writing to all known creditors, and by
such person, as the judge shall direct.

SECT. 61. The resignation or removal of an assignee
shall in no way release him from performing all things
requisite on his part for the proper closing up of his trust
and the transmission thereof to his successors; nor affect
the liability of the principal or surety on the bond given by
the assignee.

S1-:c'r. 62. When by death or otherwise the number of
assignees is reduced, the estate of the debtor not lawfully
disposed of shall vest in the remaining assignee or assignees,

and the persons selected to fill vacancies, with the same
powers and duties relative thereto as if they were originally
chosen.

SE01‘. 63. Any former assignee, his executors, or administrators, upon request, and at the expense of the estate,
shall make and execute to the new assignee all such deeds,
conveyances, andassurances, and do all such other lawful
acts, as may be needful or proper to enable him to recover
and receive all the estate; and the judge may pass all orders
which he may deem expedient to secure the proper fulfilment of the duties of any former assignee, and to secure
the rights and interests of all persons interested in the
estate.

SECT. 64. No person who shall have received any preference contrary to the provisions of the laws relating to
insolvency, shall vote for or be eligible as assignee, but no
title to property, real or personal, sold, transferred, or
conveyed, by an assignee, shall be affected or impaired by
reason of his ineligibility.

SECT. 65. An assignee refusing or unreasonably neglecting to execute an instrument when lawfully required by
the judge, or disobeying a lawful order or decree of the judge
in the premises, may be committed to and detained in the
jail of the county where he is found, or in which he dwelt
when he was appointed, until he obeys such order or decree,
or is released by the supreme judicial court or some justice
thereof on a writ of habeas comus.

EXAMINATION, &c., or DEBTOB.

SECT. 66. The debtor shall at all times before the
granting of his certificate, upon reasonable notice, attend
and submit to an examination on oath before the judge and
the assignee upon all matters relating to the disposal of his
estate; to his trade and dealings with others, and his
accounts concerning the same; to all debts due or claimed
from him; and to all other matters concerning his estate,
and the due settlement thereof according to law; which
examination shall be in writing when so required by the
judge, shall be signed by the debtor, and filed with the other
proceedings.

SECT. 67. If the debtor shall be in jail in any suit or
proceeding for or on account of any debt or demand that
is provable against his estate, at any time before the
granting of his certificate and when his attendance may be
required before the court or the assignee, or at any meeting

of his creditors, the judge may, in his discretion, by warrant
under his hand require the jailer to produce the debtor for
the purposes aforesaid, at such time and place as may be
specified in the warrant.

SECT. 68. If the debtor is by reason of imprisonment,
sickness, or any other cause which shall be deemed suiiicient
by the judge, unable to attend before the judge, or the
assignee, or at any meeting of his creditors, the judge, or
some person to be deputed by him for that purpose, and
the assignee, or some person appointed by him, shall attend
the debtor, in jail or elsewhere, if he be within this state,
in order to take his examination; and the examination thus
taken shall be of the same force and effect as if the debtor
had attended in person before the judge or assignee, or at
the meetings aforesaid, and had there undergone the same
examination.

SECT. 69. If the debtor is without this state and unable
to return and give his personal attendance at any of the
times and for the purposes specified in this chapter, and if
it appears that such absence was not caused by his wilful
default, and he shall as soon as may be after the removal of
such impediment offer to attend and submit to an examination on oath before the judge and the assignee as herein
provided, and do and perform all things required by this
chapter for the purpose of obtaining his certificate, he shall
be entitled thereto in like maner as if he had done the same
things at the times respectively herein prescribed.

make and execute such deeds and writings, and indorse
such bills, notes, and other negotiable papers, draw such
checks and orders for moneys deposited in banks or elsewhere, and do all such other lawful acts and things, as the
assignee shall at any time reasonably require, and which
may be necessary or useful for confirming the assignment,
and enabling the assignee to demand, recover, and receive,
all the estate and effects so assigned, especially any part
thereof which may be without this state.

SI-JCT. 71. If the debtor refuses or unreasonably neglects
to execute an instrument when lawfully required pursuant
to an order of the judge, or disobeys any lawful order or
decree, the judge shall issue his warrant to any civil oflicer,
commanding him to arrest and commit the debtor to the jail
in the county where he may be found, or where he dwelt at
the time of his insolvency; and he shall remain in close
custody until he obeys such order or decree, unless he is
released by the supreme judicial court or some justice
thereof on a writ of habeas corpus.

SECT. 72. The judge shall appoint a second meeting of
the creditors, to be held at a court not more than three
months after the date of the warrant, regard being bad to
the distance at which the creditors reside. The debtor
shall then be allowed to amend and correct his schedule of
creditors, and shall take and subscribe an oath before the
judge, which shall be certified by him and filed in the case,
in substance as follows :—

" I do swear that the account of my creditors contained in the
schedule made and signed by me and now in the hands of the assignee
chosen by my creditors is in all res ects 'ust and true, according to my
best knowledge and belief‘. And I o furt er swear, that I have delivered
to , the messen er, all my estate, (excepting such parts thereof as

expended for the sup ort of myself and my family,) and all my books of
account and papers re ating to my said estate, that were within my possession or power when the same were demanded of me by the messenger;

papers, as have since come to my Hossession; and that if any other estate,
e ects, or other thin , which sha or ought to be assigned and delivered
to the assignee. shal hereafter come to my knowledge or ossession, I
will forthwith disclose or deliver the same to him. And IP do further
swear, that there is not any part of my estate or effects made over or
disposed of in any manner for the future benefit of myself or my family,
or in order to defraud my creditors.”

SECT. 73. When a failure to call or hold a second or
third meeting within the time prescribed occurs, such
meeting may, upon the petition of an interested party, be
ordered at the discretion of the supreme judicial court or
any justice thereof, with like effect as to the validity of the
proceedings as if the meeting had been duly held.

SI-:c'r. 74. Upon the death, resignation, or neglect, of the
assignee, or his absence from the county, whereby a meeting
to be notified by him is liable to be defeated, such meeting
may be notified by the register on the order of the judge,
on petition of any ‘interested party, with notice at the
discretion of the judge to the assignee if living, and with
the like effect as if the meeting had been called and
notified by the assignee.

SECT. 75. The judge shall appoint a third meeting of the
creditors to be held within six months from the time of the
appointment of the assignee ; at which meeting or some
meeting thereafter, if it shall then appear to the satisfaction

_ Si-:cT. 77. If the debtor at the time of obtaining his
certificate is in jail on any suit or proceeding for or on
account of any claim provable against his estate, he shall be
discharged from such imprisonment upon producing to

the jailer his certificate granted pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter.

SECT. 78. The debtor shall also be forever thereafter dis- ;
charged and exempt from arrest or imprisonment in any .
suit or upon any proceeding for or on account of any debt I
or demand which might have been proved against his estate. l
And the property and estate of the debtor by him acquired 
subsequently to the time of the first publication of the notice
of the issuing of the warrant, shall not be subject to attachment, by trustee process or otherwise, in any suit to recover
a debt which may have been so provable and due to any
person or persons not resident in this state at the time of
such first publication, or founded on any contract existing
at the time of said first publication and made or to be performed out of the limits of this state.

SECT. 79. A debt created subseqently to the fifteenth day I
of April in the year eighteen hundred and forty-four by the 1
debtor’s defalcation as a public officer, executor, adminis-]
trator, guardian, receiver, trustee, or assignee of an insolvent 2
estate, shall not be discharged under this chapter, but the f
dividend declared thereon shall be payment of so much of ‘
said debt. A claim for necessaries furnished to the debtor
or his family shall not be so discharged unless the claim is
proved against his estate,

SECT. 80. _ 'A discharge shall not release or discharge any :
person liable for the same debt as a partner, joint con- ’
tractor, indorser, surety, or otherwise, for or with the debtor. 4

SECT. 81. A discharge shall not be granted to a debtor '
whose assets do not pay fifty per cent. of the claims proved '

thereto in writing within six months after the date of the}
assignment.

SECT. 82. A discharge shall not be granted to a debtor a «
second time insolvent whose assets do not pay fifty per cent. 7
of the claims proved against his estate, unless three-fourths

a debtor a third time insolvent. But a debtor who shall

same manner and with the same effect as if he had not been
previously insolvent.

SECT. 83. A creditor may assent to the debtor’s discharge
under the two preceding sections, notwithstanding an appeal

from the allowance of his claim is pending, and such assent
shall be valid if the claim is finally allowed.

SECT. 84. When a discharge is refused a debtor for the
sole reason that the requisite majority of his creditors have
not seasonably assented thereto, or for the reason that he has
not taken the oath required by section seventy-two, the judge
upon the application of the debtor made within twelve
months after the date of the assignment and with the written assent of three-fourths in number and value of the
creditors who have proved their claims, may grant his discharge if he shall satisfy the judge on a hearing had after
public notice of said application that the want’ of assent was
occasioned by accident or mistake, and by no fault of his
own ; or that the omission to take the oath was owing to his
inability by reason of sickness to attend and take the same ;
and if he shall be present and take_ the oath-and abide and
perform all lawful orders of the court.

SECT. 85. Either the debtor or the assignee may within

of proceedings, appeal from such decision to the supreme
judicial court which shall be first held within and for the
same county next after the expiration of fourteen days from
the time of claiming the appeal.

SECT. 86. The appeal may be heard and determined by
the court of trials or court of law ; and the assignee or any

to the satisfaction of the court that the debtor has made a
full disclosure and delivery of all his estate as herein
required, and that he has in all things conformed himself to
the directions of this chapter, the court shall cause a certificate thereof in substance like that prescribed in section
seventy-five, to be made under the seal of the court, signed by
the clerk, and delivered to the debtor.

any books or writings relating thereto; or if being insolvent
and having reasonable and suflicient cause to believe himself
so, he shall within one year next before the filing of a petition by or against him, have paid or secured, either directly

document with intent to defraud his creditors; or shall

have removed himself, or removed or caused to be removed

any part of his property from the state, with intent to

defraud his creditors; or shall have made any fraudulent

payment, gift, transfer, conveyance, or assignment, of any

And the discharge shall be null and void if the debtor or any

person in his behalf shall have procured the assent of any

creditor thereto by any pecuniary consideration.

SECT. 88. If any person in contemplation of becoming
insolvent and of obtaining a discharge in insolvency shall
make any payment, pledge, assignment, transfer, or conveyance, of any part of his property, directly or indirectly, absolutely or conditionally, for the purpose of preferring any

is or may be under any liability for him, or for the purpose
of preventing the property from coming to the hands of his
assignee in insolvency, or of being distributed under the
laws relating to insolvency in satisfaction of his debts, except
as is provided in section ninety, he shall not be entitled to
a discharge, and any discharge which he may have received
shall be void and of no effect.

0 person receiving such payment, pledge, assignment, transfer,
1 or conveyance, or to be benefited thereby, having reasonable

» transfer, or other conveyance of any description, of any part

to believe such person insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, and that such sale, assignment, transfer, or other conveyance, is made with a view to prevent the property from
coming to his assignee in insolvency, or to prevent the same
from being distributed under the laws relating to insolvency,
or to defeat the object of, or in any wayimpair,hinder, impede,
or delay, the operation and effect of, or to evade, any of said
provisions ; the sale, assignment, transfer, or conveyance, shall
be void, and the assignee may recover the property or the
value thereof as assets of ‘the insolvency. And if such sale,

assignment, transfer, or conveyance, is not made in the
usual and ordinary course of business of the debtor, that

fact shall be prima facie evidence of such cause of belief.

for such time, not exceeding two months, as the judge shall

thereupon order a dividend of the estate and effects, or of
such part thereof as he shall think fit, among such of the

assign such debts or other property in such manner as the
court shall order.

like manner as often as occasion shall require.

SECT. 101. No creditor whose debt shall be proved at the

goods so replevied, the plaintiff in the replevin and his
sureties shall be liable for the whole of the goods, or the

purchase the estate for a valuable consideration and in good

SECT. 58. If an answer contains irrelevant matter or
is not full and clear, or if an interrogatory is not answered,

or to answer a particular interrogatory, the court or any
justice thereof may on motion order such irrelevant matter
to be expunged, or such imperfect answer to be made full
and clear, or such interrogatory to be answered, within
such time as may seem reasonable.

SECT. 59. When an answer is adjudged irrelevant or

Ofer of Judgment. '

Snow. 66. When a defendant in an action at law or suit
in equity, wherein damages only are sought to be recovered,
shall offer in court and consent in writing to be defaulted,

and that judgment shall be rendered against him, as damages for a sum therein specified, the same shall be entered
of record together with the time when it was tendered;
and the plaintiif may at any time within ten days after he
has received notice of such oifer and consent accept the
offer, and the court shall render judgment accordingly, with
costs to the date of the notice. If after such notice the
court shall for good cause grant the plaintiff a further time
to elect, he may signify his acceptance within the time
allowed, and judgment shall be rendered as if the acceptance
had been within ten days.

SECT. 67. If the plaintiff does not elect to accept such
offer, and shall not recover a greater sum than the sum
so odered, not including interest on the sum recovered in

Hearing-, Trial, Evidence.

Sncr. 68. Every demurrer may in the first instance be
heard by a single justice, and if taken in term time during
the same term if practicable; and his decision as to the
misjoinder of counts shall be final, an amendment being
allowed as herein provided. But if the cause of demurrer
shall be that the facts do not in point of law support or
answer the action, and the party against whom the decision
shall be made shall not pray for leave to amend, such decision
shall not be iinal, but the demurrer may be further heard
upon appeal or otherwise as is provided in respect to such
questions of law. When a demurrer is sustained, overruled,
or withdrawn, the court shall make such order as may be fit,
respecting the Iiling of an answer or replication, or a trial of
the facts.

SECT. 69. If a demurrer appears to the judge who first
hears the same, to be frivolous, immaterial, or intended for
delay, he may besides overruling it order the party to
plead, answer, or reply, notwithstanding such party shall
claim the right to be further heard by appeal or otherwise
on his demurrer; and thereupon the case shall proceed
to a Iinal judgment as if no demurrer had been filed, and
execution may be awarded or stayed on such terms as
the court may deem reasonable, as in cases of exceptions
adjudged frivolous.

SECT. 72. Atrial shall not be delayed for want of a reply
to the defendant’s answer, unless by special order of the
court; nor shall an agreement of parties respecting nling
amendments of papers operate to postpone the trial of an
action beyond the time at which by the rules of the court it

would be tried. '

S1-301'. 78. A trial shall not be delayed for the reason that
interrogatories have been filed and the time allowed for
answering the same has not elapsed, but the court may

provided.

S1-:c'r. 74. When it shall appear on a trial that a local
action has been brought in an erroneous venue, the court

good cause shall be shown why the trial should be allowed
to proceed.

Swr. 75. If the plaintiff shall fail to give evidence at the
trial in support of any count in the declaration not wholly
or partly confessed by the answer, it shall forthwith be
stricken out. And the court may, either of their own
motion or upon motion of a party, require unnecessary
counts and statements to be stricken out of a declaration or
any subsequnt proceeding, and may impose such terms as
may be deemed reasonable.

SE01‘. 76. Neither the declaration, answer, nor any subsequent allegation, shall be deemed evidence on the trial,
but allegations only whereby the party making them is
bound.

SECT. 77. No offer or consent, made in pursuance of sections sixty-six and sixty-seven, which shall not be accepted,

matters in his defence, no averment, confession, or acknowledgment, contained in one of them, shall be used or taken as

evidence against him on the trial of any issue joined on any
other of them.

SECT. 80. If the defendant in an action for slander or
publishing a libel, shall justify that the words spoken or
published were true, such allegation though not maintained
by the evidence, shall not be of itself proof of the malice
alleged in the declaration.

Snow. 81. In every prosecution and in every civil action
for writing or for publishing a libel, the defendant may upon

-the trial give in evidence the truth of the matter contained

in the publication charged as libellous; and such evidence

seem doubtful whether a party could be admitted for a co-defendant. But the

‘act of 1851, ch. 255, § 3, allows a defendant who is defaulted, to be called “ by
the party defending.” The section as here drawn makes parties “ competent
witnesses for themselves or any other party,” which would seem to cover all
the cases intended by the legislature, by both acts. The provision in 1857,
ch. 305, § 1, that “ no person so testifying shall be compelled to criminate
himself,” is omitted as useless, the twelfth article of the declaration of rights
having made sumcient provision on that subject without legislative enactments.
The act of 1857 appears to supersede section 2 of chap. 107 of statutes of
1839, and it is omitted.

Sect. 62. In line 2, the words “ state and” are added as an amendment.

or has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed
any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein;
and the party objecting to the juror may introduce any other
competent evidence in support of the objection. If it
appears to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent
in the cause, another shall be called and placed in his stead
for the trial of that cause. .

SECT. 30. In indictments and penal actions for the
recovery of any sum of money or other thing forefeited, it

verdict and award a new trial of the cause.

party making the motion shall advance a sum sufficient to

of the peace or justices’ or police court, the sheriff or other
officer before whom the jurors were required to appear, shall
make known the fact to the court of common pleas, superior
court, or municipal court, then next to be held in the same
county, and the court after due examination and a hearing
of the parties who are charged shall impose the fine.

in his stead, or in any other way in the drawing of jurors,
ldieushall be punished by a line not exceeding five hundred

o ars.

SECT. 4. In actions upon promissory notes and other
contracts where the amount due appears to be undisputed,
the debt or damages may be assessed and ascertained by the
clerk, either under a general order of the court or by a
special reference of the case to him. The judgment in
either case shall be entered in the same form as if it had
been awarded by the court on an assessment or computation
made by themselves.

Sscr. 5. In any action founded on a contract express or
implied in which there is more than one defendant, the
plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment against such defendants as are defaulted, and against those who shall upon trial

liable thereon.

SECT. 6. In such action when any defendants are

defaulted, and upon trial any of the others are found liable,

issue separate executions on such judgment.

SE01‘. 7. When a motion for a new trial is overruled, the
court shall enter judgment as of the term when the verdict

of the prevailing party, or prevent loss by reason of the
death of either party or otherwise.

SE01‘. 8. When judgment is made up upon an award of
county commissioners, a committee, or referees, or on the
report of an auditor or master in chancery, or on a verdict
of a jury, interest shall be computed upon the amount of
the award, report, or verdict, from the time when made
to the time of making up the judgment. Every judgment for the payment of money rendered subsequently to
the sixth day of May in the year eighteen hundred and
forty-seven, shall bear interest from the day of the rendition
thereof. The warrant or execution issued on a judgment
for the payment of money, shall specify the day upon which
judgment is rendered, and shall require the collection or
satisfaction thereof with interest from the day of its rendition.

Sscr. 9. In actions forabreach of the condition of a bond
or to recover a penalty for the non-performance of a covenant, contract, or agreement, when it appears by verdict,

broken or the penalty forfeited, judgment shall be entered
for the penal sum, but no execution shall issue thereon
except as is provided in the following sections.

SECT. 10. The court shall award an execution for so
much of the penal sum as shall then be due and payable?
in equity and good conscience for the breach of the con-§
dition, or other non-performance of the contract. The sum
shall be ascertained and determined by the court, unless
either party shall move to have it assessed by a jury, or
the court shall think proper to have the question so decided,
in which cases it shall be assessed by a jury.

Snow. 11. If any further sum afterwards becomes due
on such bond or other contract, the plaintiff, his executors,
or administrators, may have a scire facias on the judgment,
from the court in which it was rendered, against the original defendant, his executors, administrators, heirs, devisees,
or assigns, as the case may be, suggesting such further
breaches of the contract as shall have occurred, and summoning the adverse party to show cause why execution
should not be awarded upon the judgment for the damages
caused by such further breaches.

S1-:c'r. 12. The sum due in such suit shall be assessed :
and determined in the same manner as in the original suit, 1
and execution shall be awarded accordingly; and like proceedings may be repeated upon occasion of further breaches
of the same contract, as often as they shall occur until the
whole of the penalty is exhausted.

SE01‘. 13. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any
person from bringing an action for the breach of any covenant or other contract, instead of suing for the penalty by
which the performance of the covenant or contract may
have been secured.

SECT. 14. When judgment is rendered in a local action
brought in an erroneous venue, the court shall cause its
writ of possession or other needful writ of execution to be
directed to the sheriff of the proper county, so that the
judgment may be duly executed.

SECT. 15. No execution shall be issued within twentyfour hours after the entry of judgment.

SECT. 16. No original execution shall be issued, unless
within one year after the party shall be entitled to sue out
the same; and no alias or other successive execution shall
be issued afterwards, unless each one be sued out within

one year after the return day of that which preceded it,
except as provided in the following section.

SECT. 17. When a judgment debtor is surrendered by
his bail, the creditor may sue out a new execution within
thirty days after the surrender, although more than one
year should have elapsed after the return day of the next
preceding execution.

SECT. 18. If a judgment remains unsatisfied after the
expiration of the time for taking out execution thereon, the
creditor may have a scire facias to obtain a new execution,
or he may at any time after the judgment have an action
of contract thereon.

SECT. 19. If an execution is returned satisfied in whole
or in part by the sale of property which shall afterwards
appear not to have belonged to the judgment debtor, or not
to have been liable to such execution, and if damages are
recovered against the judgment creditor or the officer who
served the execution on account of the seizure andsale of
the property, the creditor may have a writ of scire facias on
his judgment, and shall thereupon be entitled to a new
execution for the sum then remaining justly and equitably
due to him.

SECT. 20. If an execution against a corporation is satisfied in whole or in part by service or levy on the person or
property of any member thereof, and the property levied
on, or damages for service or levy, shall have been subsequently recovered by such member from the oiiicer or judgment creditor, the creditor may have a writ of scire facias
on his judgment, and shall thereupon be entitled to a new
execution for the sum remaining justly and equitably due
to him.

SECT. 21. The forms of executions shall be the same as
heretofore established by law and the usage and practice
of the courts. Executions issued upon judgments in civil
actions in favor of the commonwealth shall be in form like
those in favor of citizens. Executions issued by a justice
of the peace, or police or justices’ court, for a sum as damages

who is seized of the freehold at the-time of making the

thereon.

SECT. 2. One or more of the persons so holding lands
may apply by petition to the court of common pleas, superior court of the county of Suffolk, or supreme judicial court,
held within or for the county in which the lands lie, for a
partition of the same ; and said courts may cause partition
to be made, and the share or shares of the petitioners to be
set off and assigned; and the residue of the premises shall
remain for the person or persons entitled thereto, and if
more than one person is so entitled, subject to a future
partition.

SECT. 3. Such petition, except as provided in section
sixty-seven, may be maintained by any person who has an
estate in possession, but not by one who has only a remainder or reversion. ‘

SI-:c'r. 4. No tenant _for a term of years, unless at least
twenty years thereof remain unexpired, shall maintain such ;

more persons hold jointly or in common as tenants for a term ~
of years, either of them may have his share set off and divided
from the others.

SECT. 5. Such partition between tenants for years shall
continue in force only so long as their estates endure, and
shall not affect the premises when they revert to the respective landlords or reversioners.

SECT. 6. The petition shall set forth the rights and
titles, so far as known to the petitioner, of all persons
interested in the premises who would be bound by the partition, whether they have an estate of inheritance, for life
or years, in possession, remainder, or reversion, and whether
vested or contingent; and if the petitioner holds an estate
for life or years, the person entitled to the remainder or
reversion shall be considered one of the persons so interested,
and entitled to notice.

SECT. 7. Every petition for partition tiled originally either
in the supreme judicial court, superior court, or court of ”
common pleas, shall be indorsed in the same manner as is ‘
prescribed with respect to original writs, and all regulations

concerning the indorsement of original writs, shall apply in
like manner to the indorsement of such petitions.

SECT. 9. The petition may be filed in vacation_or term
time in the oiiice of the clerk of the court in which the suit
is brought; and a summons to appear and answer thereto
shall be signed by the clerk, and served upon each of the
parties named in the petition as interested in the premises,
if found in this state, by delivering to him or leaving at the
place of his abode a copy of the petition and of the summons,
attested by the clerk or officer who serves the process, fourteen days at least before the sitting of the court to which he
intends to present the same.

SECT. 9. The petitioner may fourteen days at least before
the sitting of the court to which he intends to present his
petition, without filing the same in the clerk’s office, cause
the parties interested to be served with a copy thereof
attested by the officer, by delivering or leaving the same in
the manner aforesaid fourteen days at least before the sitting
of the court to which he intends to present it.

SECT. 10. If any of the persons so named are absent
from the state, or if there are any persons interested in
the premises who would be bound by the partition and
whose names are unknown to’ the petitioner, the court
shall order notice to be given to all such persons by a publication of the petition or substance thereof, with the order of
the court thereon, in one or more newspapers, to be designated in the order, or by delivering to any absent party who is

or notice shall be made returnable to that court.

and if the service of the summons, or other notice to him,
shall appear to the court to be in any way defective or

insullicient, the court may order such further notice as they

SECT. 13. If in any stage of the proceedings it shall
appear to the court that any person interested, whether
named in the petition or not, is out of the state, and has

shall be continued from term to term until he has had time
to appear and answer thereto.

SEc'1'. 14. When commenced in the court of. common

judicial court, by making ailidavit substantially as required
for the removal of actions at law.

SECT. 15. The court may assign a guardian for any
infant or insane person who is interested in the premises,
in the same manner as a guardian is admitted for an infant
defendant in actions at the common law.

SECT. 16. Any person interested in the premises may
appear and answer to the petition, and may plead or
answer either separately or jointly with any other respondents, any matter tending to show that the petitioner ought
not to have partition as prayed for, either in whole or in.
part; and the further pleadings shall be conducted as in
actions at the common law.

SECT. 17. If a person who is not named in the petition
appears and pleads or answers, the petitioner may reply that
such person has no estate or interest in the lands, and may
pray judgment, if he shall be admitted to object; and the
petitioner may in the same replication answer to such plea
any other matter as he might have done if he had not
disputed the respondent’s right to appear.

SECT. 18. If upon such replication it appears that the
respondent has no estate or interest in the lands, the matter

of his plea or objection to the partition shall be no further
inquired of.

SECT. 19. If upon the trial of an issue it appears that
the petitioner is entitled to have partition as prayed for,
he shall recover his costs of such trial against the party
who objected thereto, and shall have execution therefor.

‘If such issue is found or decided against him, in whole or

in part, the adverse party shall recover against him the
costs of the trial, and shall have execution therefor; but
judgment may notwithstanding be rendered for the petitioner to have partition, and to have assigned to him such

part of the premises if any as he shall appear to be
entitled to.

S1-.:c'r. 20. If it appears that the petitioner is entitled to
have partition, whether for the share or proportion claimed

in his petition or any less share, the court shall award the
interlocutory judgment, that partition shall be made.

SECT. 21. When partition is to be made, the court shall
appoint three or l'lV6 disinterested persons as commissioners
to make the partition, and set off to the petitioner the share
or shares belonging to him, which shall be expressed in the

execution of their duties shall be sworn faithfully and
impartially to execute the same, a certificate of which oath
shall be made on the warrant by the person who administered it.

SECT. 23. The commissioners shall give sufficient notice
of the time and place appointed for making the partition,
to all persons interested therein who are known and within
the state, that they may be present at the making thereof.

SECT. 24. All the commissioners shall meet for the performance of any of their duties, but the acts of a majority
shall be valid.

SECT. 25. If there are several petitioners they may at
their election have their shares set off together or in severalty.

SECT. 26. When the premises consist of a mill or other
tenement which cannot be divided without damage to the
owners, or when any specific part of the estate is of greater
value than either party’s share and cannot be divided without damage to the owners, the whole estate, or the part
thereof so incapable of division, may be set off to any one of
the parties who will accept it, he paying to any one or more
of the others such sums of money as the commissioners shall
award to make the partition just and equal ; or the commissioners may assign the exclusive occupancy and enjoyment
of the whole, or the part, to each of the parties alternately
for certain specified times, in proportion to their respective
interests.

SECT. 27. When the whole or any specific part of the
premises is thus assigned, the person entitled for the time
being to the exclusive occupancy shall be liable to his
co—tenants for any injury to the premises occasioned by his
misconduct, as a tenant for years under a common lease
without express covenants would be liable to his landlord ;
and the other tenants in common may have their remedy
therefor against him by an action of tort, jointly or severally at their election.

SECT. 28. Whilst an estate is in the exclusive occupancy ;
of a co-tenant under such an assignment, he shall be entitled 1
to the same remedy against any person who shall trespass ?
upon or otherwise injure the premises, as if he held the
same under a lease for the term for which they were so
assigned to him; and he and all the other tenants in common shall be entitled to recover such other and further
damages as they shall have sustained by the same trespass
or injury, in like manner as if the premises had been leased
by them. Joint damages recovered by such tenants in common by force of this or the preceding section, shall be
apportioned and divided among them according to their
respective rights, by the court in which the judgment is
recovered.

S1-:c'r. 29. The commissioners shall make a return of ‘
their doings under their hands, together with their warrant. .
If their report is confirmed, judgment shall be rendered}
that the partition be firm and effectual forever.

S1-:c'r. 30. Any party aggrieved by any judgment rendered in the court of common pleas or superior court under a
section twenty, or upon a report of commissioners under?
this chapter, may appeal therefrom in any matter of law‘
apparent upon the record, to the supreme judicial court,
but upon an appeal from the judgment upon the report of
commissioners, the interlocutory judgment awarding that
partition be made shall not be drawn in question.

SECT. 31. The regulations herein prescribed as to appeals
from the first and second judgment on a petition for partition, shall be enforced in like manner, in a writ of partition.

SECT. 32. The final judgment shall, except as hereinafter provided, be conclusive as to the rights of property.
and possssion of parties and privies to the judgment, includ- :
ing all persons who might by law have appeared and,
answered. a

SECT. 33. If any person who was a part owner with the ,
petitioner, and for whom a share is left upon the partition, =
should be out of the state when the summons or notice to .
him is served, and should not return in time to appear and
answer, he may within three years after the final judgment
apply to the same court for a new partition; and if upon
a hearing of all parties interested, it appears that the share
left for the applicant was less than he was entitled to,
or that the part left for him was not at the time equal in
value to his share of the premises, they may order a new
partition, which shall be made in the manner before provided.

SECT. 34. In such new partition the commissioners shall
not be required to make a new division of the whole
premises, but may take from any one share or shares and
add to any other or others so much as shall be necessary
to make the partition just and equal, estimating the whole
as in the state in which it was when first divided; or if
an equal partition cannot be made without inconvenience
to the owners, the commissioners may award money to be

paid by one party to another as before provided,‘ to equalize
the shares.

Sscr. 35. If any person who has not appeared and
answered to the petition shall claim to hold in severalty
any part of the premises, he shall not be concluded by the
judgment, but may bring his action for the land claimed
by him, against any or all of the petitioners or respondents,
or of the persons holding under them, within the time
in which he might have brought it if no such judgment for
partition had been rendered.

SECT. 36. When a person who has not appeared and
answered shall claim the share that was assigned to or left
for any of the supposed part owners in the judgment for partition, he shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it
respects the partition and the assignment of the shares, in
like manner as if he had been a party to that suit, but
may bring his action for the share claimed by him, against
the person to whom it was assigned or for whom it was left.

Sncr. 37. The action shall be brought against the tenant
in possession as if the demandant had originally claimed
the specific piece demanded instead of an undivided part
of the land; and it may be brought within the time in
which it might have been brought if no such judgment for
partition had been rendered.

SECT. 38. If two or more persons appear as respondents,
claiming the same share of the premises to be divided, it
shall not be necessary to decide on their respective claims,
except for the purpose of determining which shall be admitted to appear in the suit; and if partition is made, the
share so claimed shall be left for whichever of the parties
shall prove to be entitled to it, in a suit to be thereafter
brought between themselves.

SECT. 39. If in such case it is decided in the suit for
partition that either of the respondents is not entitled to
the share that he claims, he shall be concluded by the
judgment, so far as it respects the partition and assignment
of the shares; but may bring an action against the other

claimant in the manner provided in the three preceding
sections.

SECT. 40. If any person who has not appeared and j
answered shall claim part of the premises as a part owner =
with any of those who were parties to the suit, and if the :
part or share so claimed was not known, or not allowed and ‘
left for him, in the process for partition, he shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects the partition,
but may bring an action for the share or proportion claimed
by him, against each of the persons holding any part of the
premises under the judgment for partition, and if he prevails, shall recover against each the same proportion or
share of the part held by him, that he was entitled to claim
out of the whole premises before the partition.

SECT. 41. If after partition it appears that any person
for whom a share was left or assigned, had died before
the partition, his heir or devisee shall not by reason of his
having been a party to the suit, be barred from claiming
the share that belonged to him; but shall have the same
rights and remedies as if he had not been such party,
and had not had notice of the pendency thereof.

.SECT. 42. If a person to or for whom any share shall
have been so assigned or left is evicted by a person who at
the time of the partition had a title older and better than
the title of those who were parties to the suit, the person so

evicted may have a new partition of the residue, as if partition had not been made.

SECT. 43. A person having a mortgage, attachment, or
other lien, on the share of a part owner, shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects the partition
and the assignment of the shares; but his lien shall remain

in full force upon the part assigned to or left for such part
owner.

Sncr. 44. The expenses and charges of the commissioners shall be ascertained and allowed by the court; the
other costs shall be taxed in the usual manner; and the
whole shall be paid by the petitioner, except the costs of a
trial of issues. When there is more than one petitioner
the whole costs and charges payable by them, shall be paid

in proportion to the shares or interests they respectively
hold in the premises.

SECT. 45. When a petition is opposed by any respondent
therein named, and it appears that the petitioner is entitled

to have partition as prayed for, he shall recover costs

against the party opposing, from and after the filing of the
plea. or answer, to be taxed as in other civil cases. ~

SECT. 46. If the plaintiff or petitioner recovers judgment
in any writ or other process of partition in which it appears
by the pleadings that the defendant or respondent denies
the right and title of the plaintiff or petitioner to any part
of the premises, and claims the same as his own estate in
fee ; and it is proved that the defendant or respondent held
the same under a title which he believed to be good, he
shall be entitled to compensation for the value of any
buildings or improvements on the premises made or erected
by himself or any other person under whom he claims;
such value to be ascertained as provided for tenants in real
actions, by chapter one hundred and thirty-four; and in like
manner he shall be liable for the plaintiff or petitioner’s
share of the rents, profits, and other damages, mentioned in
said chapter.

SECT. 47. If any sum remains due to the defendant or
respondent for improvements, after deducting the rents,
profits, or other damages, for which he is found chargeable,
the plaintiff or petitioner shall not have judgment for
partition until he has paid the same to the defendant or
respondent, or for his use to the clerk of the court ; and he
shall not be entitled to any rents or profits which may
accrue after verdict, and before he makes such payment.

IN THE PROBATE COURT.

SECT. 48. ‘The probate court in which the estate of any
deceased person is settled or in a course of settlement, may
make partition of all his real estate lying within the state,
among his heirs or devisees and all persons holding under
them, in the manner and under the restrictions hereinafter
provided.

SE01‘. 49. The partition shall be made by three or five
disinterested persons to be appointed as commissioners for
that purpose by the court. They shall before proceeding to
the execution of their duties be sworn faithfully and impartially to execute the same, and shall proceed therein in the
manner before prescribed with regard to commissioners
appointed by the courts of law, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.

Sscfr. 50. If there is estate to be divided lying in different counties, the judge may if he thinks [it issue a
separate warrant and appoint different commissioners for
each county; and the partition shall be made of the estate

in each county in like manner as if there were no other
estate.

SECT. 51. Such partition may be ordered on the petition
of any of said parties interested, after due notice to all the
others to appear and show cause against it. The notice
shall be served fourteen days at least before the time
appointed for the hearing, on the parties personally if they
can be found within the state, and if not, it shall be published
once in each week for three weeks at least -before such
hearing, in such newspapers as the court shall order.

SECT. 52. After the commissioners are appointed, some
disinterested person shall be appointed agent by the court
for any heir at law or devisee who may be absent from the
state; and he shall act for such absent heir or devisee in
all things relating to the partition.

SECT. 53. If it appears that any infant or insane person
is interested in the premises, and has no guardian within

a the state, the court shall assign him a guardian for the suit,

to appear for him and defend his interests therein.

SECT. 54. The partition when made on the application

of an heir, shall be made of all the estate that descended.

from the ancestor, and which any party interested, whether
the applicant or others, shall require to have included in
the partition; and when made on the application of a
devisee, it shall be made of all the estate held by the
applicant jointly or in common with others holding under
the testator, which he or any other devisee shall require
to have included. The same rule shall apply when the
application is made by any person holding under an heir
or devisee.

SECT. 55. Upon every such partition the court shall not
only assign and set 011‘ to the applicant his share in the
premises, but shall cause the residue to be divided among
the parties interested and the share of each one to be
assigned to him, unless two or more of the parties consent
to hold their shares together and undivided.

SECT. 56. When a messuage, piece of land, or other
part of the premises, is of greater value than either party’s
share, and cannot be divided without great inconvenience
to the owners, it may be set oil‘ to any one of the parties
who will accept it, he paying to any one or more of the
others such sums of money as the commissioners shall
award to make the partition just and equal.

SECT. 57. In the assignment of part of the premises
under the preceding section, males shall be preferred to
females, and among the children of the deceased, elder
shall be preferred to younger sons.

SECT. 58. When such real estate cannot be divided
without damage to the owners, the whole or any part thereof
may be set off to one or more of the parties among whom
partition is ordered to be made, he or they paying to the
other parties such sums of money as the commissioners
shall award.

SECT. 59. The expenses and charges incurred shall be
ascertained and allowed by the court, and paid by all the
parties interested in the partition in proportion to their
respective shares or interests in the premises. If any one
shall neglect to pay his part, an execution therefor in
common form may be issued against him.

S1-:c'r. 60. No partition shall be made by the probate
court when the shares or proportions of the respective parties
are in dispute between them, or shall appear to the judge
to be uncertain depending upon the construction or effect
of any devise or other conveyance, or upon other questions
that he shall deem proper for the consideration of a jury
and a court of common law.

SECT. 61. When any part of the real estate of the deceased
lies in common and undivided with that of another person,
the probate court may cause it to be divided and set 011'
from the part held by such co-tenant, before making partition among the heirs or others claiming under the deceased.

SECT. 62. The court in such case shall order a notice of
the intended partition to be given to the co-tenant, containing a description of the premises to be divided, with a statement of the share or proportion claimed as belonging to
the estate of the deceased, and of the time and place
appointed for hearing the case. It shall be served on the
co-tenant by delivering to him an attested copy, or by
leaving such copy at the place of his abode in this state,
fourteen days at least before the time appointed for the
hearing.

SECT. 63. If it appears in any stage of the proceedings
that any person interested in the premises, other than
the heirs and devisees of the deceased and those claiming
under them, was absent from the state at the time when the
notice was served, and has not returned, the probate court
shall either dismiss the application for partition, or stay all

further proceedings until such absent party appears and.
answers thereto, or signifies in writing to the court his
consent that partition be made as proposed.

SECT. 64. The partition when finally confirmed and 1
established shall be conclusive on all the heirs and devisees :
of the deceased, and all persons claiming under them: on
all other persons interested in the premises who appeared
and answered in the case, or assented to the proposed partition as before provided, and on every person so interested,
on whom notice was served by delivering to him a copy
thereof, or by leaving it at the place of his abode at a time
when he was within the state.

SECT. 65. Such partition shall not be conclusive upon
any persons other than those mentioned in the preceding
section. All other persons may pursue their legal remedies for recovering the premises, or as much thereof as may
belong to them, and also for obtaining partition thereof,

in like manner as if the proceedings in the probate court
had not been had.

0

ADVANCEMENTS.

SECT. 66. Questions concerning advancements of either
party may be heard and determined upon a petition for
partition, or the court may suspend proceedings until that
question is decided in the probate court in which the estate
of the deceased is settled ; which court may hear and determine all such questions, saving an appeal as in other cases
to the supreme judicial court. The final decree or sentence
thereon shall be binding on all parties interested, whether
the partition is made by the probate court or in the courts

‘of common law. .

GENERAL PROVISIONS.

SECT. 67. Partitions may be made under this chapter
notwithstanding the existence of any lease of the whole or a
part of the estate to be divided; and no partition heretofore made by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be
rendered invalid by reason of the existence of such lease:
provided, that such partition shall not prejudice the right
of a lessee.

SECT. 68. Such partitions may be made notwithstanding
any of the tenants in common may be, alone or jointly with
others, trustee, attorney, or guardian, of any other tenant;
and no partitions of real estate heretofore made by a court
of competent jurisdiction, shall be rendered invalid by

to, or in trust for, persons not in being at the time of
application for partition, upon notice to the persons who

and services, including compensation of counsel, to be
determined by the court, shall be paid by the persons applying for partition, and execution may be issued therefor in
the name of the person appointed. The partition made in

manner as if they had been in being and appeared and
answered in the case, or assented to the partition.

SECT. 70. When proceedings for obtaining partition shall

whom such part of the premises shall be assigned on t e
new partition, and the court may issue an execution theref r
in the common form.

made under this chapter, shall in case of an eviction be
entitled to compensation for improvements made thereon,
in the manner prescribed in chapter one hundred and

SECT. 75. The return of the commissioners when ac-I
cepted, shall remain in the oflice of the clerk of the courts, ;

supreme judicial court, or in the manner herein before provided for the division of land. In the latter case, the
commissioners appointed to make partition shall set forth in
their return the best method of setting off to the several
parties their respective shares or interests, and thereupon
the court may require the parties interested, to perform
such acts as justice and equity may require, and may make
all such orders and decrees in the premises, according to the
course of proceedings in equity, as may be necessary to do
justice between the parties.

SECTION 1. No person shall make an entry into lands or
tenements, except in cases wherehis entry is allowed by

law; and in such cases he shall not enter with force, but
in a peaceable manner.

SECT. 2. When a forcible entry is made, or when a
peaceable entry is made and the possession unlawfully held

manner provided in section twenty-eight of chapter ninety,
the lessor and his assigns may be restored to the possession
of the premises in like manner: provided, that when a
suit is brought under this chapter to recover the possession
by reason of such termination, if the tenant shall four days
at least before the return day-of the writ pay or tender to
the landlord or his attorney the rent due, with interest
thereon and all costs of suit, the lease shall be in force.
Nothing contained in this section or said section twentyeight shall affect any other rights or remedies on the part

SECT. 5. The person entitled to the possession of the
premises may take from a justice of the peace, or police or

all rent then due, all intervening rent, and all damages
and loss which the plaintiff may sustain by reason of the
withholding of the possession of the demanded premises,
and by reason of any injury done thereto during such withholding, together with all costs, until the restitution of the
possession thereof to the plaintiff, in case the judgment from
which the appeal is made shall be affirmed. Upon final
judgment for the plaintiff, all sums of money then due to
him may be recovered by writ of scire facias or action of
contract upon the recognizance.

SECT. 10. If the case is transferred at the request of the
defendant upon any plea or suggestion by him that brings
in question the title to the freehold, and if it appears to
the court in which the action is determined, that the
defendant originally entered on the premises under a lease
from the plaintiff, or from any person under whom the
plaintiff claims, or that he held them under any such lease,
and that his said plea or suggestion was frivolous and
intended for delay, the court shall cause a certificate thereof
to be entered on the record, and the defendant shall thereupon be liable to pay double the yearly value of the demised

: premises from the time of the notice to quit the same, which
« may be recovered by writ of scire facias or action of. con: tract on the recognizance.

SECT. 11. The judgment in such action shall not be a
bar to any action thereafter to be brought by either party

V to recover the premises in question, or damages for any

- trespass thereon; but the sum recovered for rent according

to the provisions of the two preceding sections, shall be
allowed and deducted in any assessment of damages in such

' subsequent action by the original plaintiff.

If it appears by default or on trial that thee
plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the premises, he

SECTION 1. If a tenant in dower, by the curtesy, or for

person having the next immediate estate of inheritance may
have an action of waste against such tenant, wherein he
shall recover the place wasted, and the amount of the
damage.

SECT. 2. An heir may bring an action for waste done in
the time of his ancestor.

SECT. 3. If an issue of fact is joined in the cause, it
shall be tried by a jury in the usual manner, either with or
without a view of the premises, as the court shall order;
and the jury that inquire of the waste shall assess the
damages.

SECT. 4. A person entitled to such action of waste, may
instead thereof bring an action of tort in the nature of
waste, in which he shall recover such damages as he has
suffered by reason of the waste.

SE01‘. 5. Such action of tort may be maintained by one
who has the remainder or reversion, in fee simple or fee
tail, after an intervening estate for life, and also by one
who has a remainder or reversion for life or years only,
and each shall recover such damages as he has suffered
by the waste.

SECT. 6. An action of tort for waste, if commenced
in the lifetime of the tenant, may be prosecuted against his

tenant, for waste committed or suffered in his lifetime.

common, of undivided lands, shall cut down, destroy, or.

carry away, any trees, timber, wood, or underwood, standing
or lying on such lands, or shall dig up or carry away any
stone, ore, or other valuable thing, found there, or shall
commit any other strip or waste, without first giving thirty
days’ notice in writing under his hand to all the other
persons interested therein, or to their respective agents or
attorneys, of his intention to enter upon and improve the
land; or if he shall do any of said acts during the pendency of a petition or other suit for the partition of the
premises; he shall forfeit three times the amount of the
damages that shall be assessed therefor, to be recovered and
appropriated as provided in the following section.

SE01‘. 8. Such damages may be recovered in an action
of tort by any one or more of the other co-tenants,

damages shall be appropriated, one-half to the persons who
shall sue, and the other half to the same persons with all
the other co-tenants except the defendant, to be divided
among them in proportion to their respective interests in
the land.

SECT. 9. If during the pendency of an action for the
recovery of lands, the tenant or person in possession shall
with knowledge of such pendency commit strip or waste,

the demandant, if he recovers judgment, may afterwards

recover, in an action of tort, three times the amount of the
damages that shall be assessed therefor.

SECT. 10. If any person shall without license wilfully
cut down, carry away, girdle, or otherwise destroy, any
trees, timber, wood, or underwood, on the land of another,
the owner may recover, in an action of tort, three times the
amount of the damages that shall be assessed therefor,
unless it appears that the defendant had good reason to
believe that the land on which the trespass was committed
was his own, or that he was otherwise lawfully authorized
to do the acts complained of, in which case he shall be
liable only for single damages. ~

SECT. 11. When a trespass on lands has been casual and A

involuntary, the trespasser may tender sufficient amends
before an action is brought; and if afterwards sued, he may
in his answer disclaim all title to the land, allege that the
trespass was casual and involuntary, and set forth the tender,
bringing the money into court. If upon the trial the allegations appear to be true, and the damages assessed do
not exceed the amount so tendered, the defendant shall
recover his costs.

SECT. 12. If a tender was not made before the commencement of the action, the defendant may disclaim title,
allege that the trespass was casual and involuntary, and
bring into court sutiicient amends, with the costs of suit up
to that time. If the plaintiff does not accept the same in
satisfaction, and if upon trial the allegations appear to be
true, and the damages assessed do not exceed the amount
so brought into court, the defendant shall recover his costs.

SECT. 13. The supreme judicial court, or one of the justices thereof, may either in term time or vacation, after the
filing of the bill or other commencement of a suit concerning waste, issue a writ of injunction to stay waste, and
issue such other Writs and processes, and make such orders
and decrees, according to the course of proceedings in equity,
as justice and equity may require.

SECT. 14. Every such injunction to stay waste may be
dissolved, either in term time or vacation, by the supreme
judicial court, or any one of the justices thereof.

SE01‘. 15. When a person whose real estate is attached

mortgage, or for possession under the same, or for the
recovery of land, and any waste on the land has been committed or threatened by the defendant, or any one claiming
under him or acting by his permission, the court in which
the suit is pending or any one of the justices may on the
application of the plaintiff, either in term time or vacation,
issue a Writ of injunction to stay such waste.

SECT. 16. In all cases under the preceding section, the
court or justice may in their discretion require that the
applicant shall before the issuing of the writ give bond with
sufficient sureties to the adverse party, conditioned that
the applicant shall pay all damages which may arise from
the issuing of the injunction, if it should be dissolved.

SECT. 17. The court may arrest and commit the defendant for a violation of such injunction, and issue such other
process as may be necessary or proper to enforce obedience
thereto, in like manner as the supreme judicial court may
do upon a suit in equity pending before them ; and the
injunction may be dissolved, either in term time or vacation,
by the court in which the suit is pending, or by any one of
the justices.

SECTION 1. When the plaintifi" prevails in an action oftort for a nuisance, the court may, in addition to the usual 
judgment for damages and costs, enter judgment that the ,
nuisance be abated and removed, and may award an exe-Z
cution in common form for the damages and costs, and a.
separate warrant to the proper officer; requiring him to
abate and remove the nuisance at the expense of the
defendant, in like manner as public and common nuisances
are abated and removed.

SECT. 2. The court may on motion of the defendant
order a stay of such warrant for ,a time not exceeding six
months, to give him opportunity to remove the nuisance,
upon his undertaking to do so within the time ordered.

SECT. 3. If the plaintifi" recovers judgment in a second
suit for the continuance or repetition of the same nuisance,
Whether there has been in the first suit a judgment for
abatement and removal or not, he shall be entitled as of
right to a judgment for abatement and removal, and to
a warrant to be issued as before provided.

SECT. 4. The expense of abatement and removal shall
be collected by the officer in the manner damages and costs
are collected upon execution; except that the materials of
buildings, fences, or other things, removed as a nuisance,
may be sold by the officer as goods are sold on execution
for the payment of debts. The oilicer shall apply the proceeds of the sale to defray the expenses of the removal, and
pay over any balance to the defendant upon demand. If
the proceeds are not sufficient to defray the expenses, he
shall collect the residue.

SECT. 5. After the commencement of a suit in equity
concerning a nuisance, the supreme judicial court or any
one of the justices, either in term time or vacation, may
issue an injunction to stay or prevent any nuisance on the
premises in question.

POSSESSION AND FORECLOSURE.
SECTION 1. After the breach of condition of a mortgage

of real estate, the mortgagee may recover possession of the A

mortgaged premises by action in the manner hereinafter
provided; or he may make an open and peaceable entry
thereon, if not opposed by the mortgagor or other person
claiming the premises; and such possession, obtained in
either mode, being continued peaceably for three years, shall
forever foreclose the right of redemption.

SE61‘. 2. When an entry for breach of the condition is
made without a judgment, a memorandum or certincate
thereof shall be made on the mortgage deed and signed by
the mortgagor or the person claiming under him, or a certificate of two competent witnesses to prove the entry shall
be made and sworn to before a justice of the peace; and
the same shall within thirty days after the entry be recorded
in the registry of deeds for the county or district where the
land lies, with a note of reference from each record to the
other, if the mortgage is recorded in the same registry. N 0
such entry shall be effectual for the purposes mentioned in
the preceding section, unless a certificate or a deposition in
proof thereof is thus made and recorded.

SECT. 3. The mortgagee in an action for possession may
declare on his own seizin, stating that it is in mortgage; and
if it shall appear to the court, upon default, demurrer,
verdict, or otherwise, that the plaintiff is entitled to the
possession of the premises for breach of the condition of the
mortgage, the court shall, on motion of either party, award
the conditional judgment hereinafter mentioned, except as
is provided in the following section.

SECT. 4. Unless the defendant is the mortgagor or his
assignee, or entitled to hold or claim the premises under
him, he shall not redeem the premises, nor have a conditional judgment rendered, unless with the consent of the
plaintiif ; but the suit shall be conducted in all respects like
a writ of entry; and in all cases the judgment for the plaintiff may be entered for possession as at common law, unless_

one or the other of the parties shall move for the conditional judgment.

SECT. 5. When the conditional judgment is to be entered,
the court shall inquire and determine how much is due to

the plaintiff on the mortgage, and shall then enter judgment,
that if the defendant shall, within two months after the
judgment, pay to the plaintiff the sum so found due on the
mortgage, with interest and the costs of the suit, the mort~
gage shall be void and the defendant shall hold the premises
discharged thereof; otherwise, that the plaintiff shall have
his execution for possession, and for costs of suit.

SECT. 6. If the condition of the mortgage is for the
doing of something other than the payment of money, or if
but part of the mortgage money is due, the court shall vary

the terms of the judgment as the case may require; but shall '

award execution as before provided, unless the defendant
shall within two months after the judgment perform what
shall be therein prescribed.

SE01‘. 7. An entry for breach of the condition may be
made, and an action for possession may be brought, by an
assignee of the mortgagee, whether the assignment be by
deed or by operation of law, and the action shall be conducted in like manner as if brought by the original mortgagee.

SECT. 8. The action may be brought like a writ of entry,
against whoever is tenant of the freehold, and the mortgagor
may in all cases be joined as a defendant, whether he then
has any estate in the premises or not; but he shall not be
liable for costs when he has no estate and makes no defence
to the suit.

SE01‘. 9. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent
a mortgagee or any person claiming under him from entering on the premises, or recovering possession thereof, before
breach of the condition of the mortgage, when there is no
agreement to the contrary; but, in such case, if the debt
is afterwards paid, or the mortgage redeemed, the amount
of the clear rents and profits from the time of the entry
shall be accounted for, and deducted from the sum due on
the mortgage.

SE01‘. 10. If such entry is before a breach of the condition, the three years limited for the redemption shall
not begin to run until after the condition is broken, nor
until after a notice in writing given by the mortgagee or
the person claiming under him, to the mortgagor or the
person claiming under him, that the former will thenceforward hold the premises for the breach of the condition, or
for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage.

SECT. 11. The person thus entitled to hold the premises
for breach of the condition,may instead of such notice in

writing make a new formal entry for the breach of the condition, or may bring an action therefor in the manner
herein before provided; and such action, if brought against
the mortgagor or any person claiming under him, may be
maintained notwithstanding the premises are at that time
in the possession of the plaintiff.

SECT. 12. Such notice of intention and such new entry
shall not be effectual for the purposes aforesaid, unless a
certificate or deposition to prove the same, is made and
recorded as before provided in the case of an original entry
for breach of the condition.

REDEMPTION.

SECT. 13. When the condition of a mortgage has been
broken, the mortgagor or any person lawfully claiming or
holding under him, may redeem the same unless the mortgagee, or some person lawfully holding or claiming under
him, has obtained possession of the premises for the breach
of the condition, and has continued that possession for three
years.

SECT. 14. The person entitled to redeem shall pay or
tender to the mortgagee, or person lawfully claiming or
holding under him, the whole sum then due and payable on
the mortgage, and shall perform or tender performance of
every other condition contained therein; and if there has
been a suit for recovering the premises, he shall pay or
tender the costs if not before paid.

SECT. 15. If the mortgagee or any person under him

has had possession of the premises, he shall account for the i
rents and profits, and shall be allowed for all sums expended 1
in reasonable repairs and improvements, all sums paid for ;
lawful taxes and assessments, and all other necessary expenses T
in the care and management of the premises. If on such?

account there is a balance due from him, it shall be considered as so much paid towards the debt due on the mortgage. If there is a balance due him, it shall be added to
the debt, and be paid or tendered as such.

SECT. 16. The tender may be made at any time within .
the three years limited for redemption, before as well;
as after an entry for breach of the condition; and if the‘

mortgagee or person claiming or holding under him shall
not accept the same and discharge the mortgage in the
manner prescribed by law, the mortgagor or person claiming
or holding under him may recover the premises by a suit
in equity for redemption.

SECT. 17. The tender, if not accepted, shall not prevent
the foreclosure of the right of redemption, unless a suit
is commenced within one year after the tender is made.

SECT. 18. If in such suit the plaintiff alleges that he
has tendered or offered to pay the sum due on the mortgage,
he shall when he commences his suit pay the sum thus
alleged to the clerk of the court for the use of the party
entitled thereto.

SECT. 19. The person entitled to redeem may at any
time within the three years limited for the redemption,
and either before or after an entry for breach of the condition, bring a suit for redemption without a previous
tender, and may therein offer to pay such sum as shall
be found due from him, or to perform such other condition as the case may require.

SE01‘. 20. The court in which a suit to redeem is pending, or any justice thereof, may at any time after the
commencement of the suit, in term time or vacation,
ascertain and determine by reference to a master or otherwise, whether any and what sum not in dispute is due on
the mortgage; and by an interlocutory order direct the
same to be paid to the mortgagee, or for his use to the
clerk of the court. ‘

SECT. 21. If suit is brought without a previous tender
and it appears that anything is due on the mortgage, the
plaintiff shall pay the costs of suit, unless it appears that
the defendant has unreasonably refused or neglected, when
requested, to render a just and true account of the money
due on the mortgage, and of the rents and profits, and
sums paid for taxes, repairs, improvements, and other
necessary expenses; or that he has otherwise by his default
prevented the plaintiff from performing or tendering performance of the condition before the commencement of
the suit. In all other cases of a suit for redemption, the
court may in their discretion award costs to either party as
equity shall require.

SECT. 22. When such suit is founded on a previous tender, and it appears that the tender was insufficient, the
plaintiff shall nevertheless be entitled to a decree for redemption, according to the provisions of sections nineteen and
twenty-one, in the same manner as if no tender had been
set forth in the suit: provided, that the suit be commenced
within the three years limited for the redemption.

SECT. 23. A suit foriredemption may be brought in the
court of common pleas, superior court, or the supreme

judicial court, held for the county where the land lies, and
if brought in the court of common pleas or superior court
an appeal may be had tothc supreme judicial court as in
other civil actions.

SECT. 24. When a bill in equity for redemption -_i_s
inserted in a writ, the service shall be deemed the commencement of the suit, if the writ or a copy thereof, with
or without the bill, but with a description of the premises
sought to be redeemed, attested by the officer, shall be
deposited within three days after the day on which the service
is made, in the office of the clerk of the court to which the
writ is returnable; otherwise the depositing of such copy or
writ shall be deemed the commencement of the suit.

S1-:c'r. 25. If it appears that the plaintill" is entitled to
redeem, the court shall inquire and determine what sum is
due on the mortgage, or what other act the plaintiff is
bound to perform for the redemption of the premises, and
shall enter a decree, that upon the payment of such sum,
or the performance of such other thing, within such time as
the court shall order, the plaintiff shall have possession of
the premises, to hold discharged of the mortgage.

SECT. 26. When it appears to the court that the mortgagee has not unreasonably neglected or refused to render
a true account of the rents and profits of the mortgaged
estate, the court may award to him the balance found due
on the mortgage with interest thereon from the expiration
of three years after such entry to the time of rendering
judgment in the suit, at a rate not exceeding twelve per
cent. a year.

SE01‘. 27. The court may at the same time order or
decree, that if the defendant neglects or refuses to accept
the money or other thing required by the decree to be paid
or performed, the money shall be left for his use with the
clerk of the court, or that such other thing shall be done as
the case may require; and the plaintiff, after having performed every thing required of him by the decree of the
court, may have an execution in common form for possession

of the mortgaged premises.

SECT. 28. If upon a suit for redemption it appears that .
the defendant has received from the rents and profits of the ?
estate or otherwise more than is due on the mortgage, the ,3
court shall award judgment and execution against him in 1
the common form for such sum as shall be due to the
plaintiff; and if there are several defendants, such judgment’
and execution may be awarded against them, either jointly

I or severally as the case may require, for the sums received

by them or either of them respectively.

SECT. 29. When the money tendered and brought into

9 court exceeds the sum found due on the mortgage, and
when any sum is awarded to the plaintiff on account of

the rents and profits received by the defendant, or for costs
of suit, the court may order the whole amount so due to
the plaintiff to be deducted from the money brought into
court, and the same shall be restored to the plaintiff, and
the residue shall be paid to the defendant.

SECT. 30. If the mortgagee or person claiming or
holding under him receives from the rents and profits of
the premises, or upon a tender made to him, or in any
other manner, more than is due on the mortgage, and if no
suit for redemption is brought against him, the mortgagor
or other person entitled to such excess may recover it in
an action of contract for money had and received to his
use.

SECT. 31. If during the pendency of a suit for redemption it appears that any other person is interested therein,
the court may cause him to be made a party thereto upon
such terms as they shall think proper; and may order a
summons or a subpoena to be issued and served on him in
such manner as they shall direct; and he shall thereupon
be allowed and required to appear and answer to the suit.

SECT. 32. If any person entitled to redeem a mortgaged estate dies without having made a tender for that
purpose, a tender may be made, and a suit for redemption
commenced and prosecuted, as well by the executors or
administrators as by the heirs or devisees of the deceased
person. SE01‘. 33. If a tender has been made by such deceased
person in his lifetime, a suit for redemption founded thereon
may be commenced and prosecuted by his heirs, devisees,
executors, or administrators, in like manner as it might
have been by the party himself; and if the plaintiff in a
suit dies, the suit whether founded ona previous tender or
not, may be prosecuted to final judgment by his heirs,
devisees, executors, or administrators.

S1-:01‘. 34. When the mortgagee or the person claiming
or holding under him is under guardianship as an infant or
otherwise, the tender may be made to the guardian, and he
may, upon satisfaction execute a release of the mortgage.

SECT. 35. When execution has issued on a judgment;
for possession and has been levied, if it shall be after:
wards satisfied by payment of the amount due on the mort- E
gage and costs, the mortgagee, his executors, administra-5
tors, or assigns, shall at the expense of the mortgagor enter
on the margin of the record of the execution an acknowledgment of satisfaction, or make to the mortgagor a deed
of release which shall be recorded, with proper notes of
reference to the execution discharged thereby.

OPENING OF FORECLOSURE.

SECT. 36. If after the foreclosure of a mortgage the:
person entitled to the debt recovers judgment for anypartf
of it, on the ground that the value of the mortgaged prem- 
ises at the time of the foreclosure was less than the sum}
due, such recovery shall open the foreclosure; and the
person entitled may redeem the premises, notwithstanding
the three years limited in that behalf have expired: provided, that his suit for redemption is brought within one
year after the recovery of such judgment.

MORTGAGES BY DEFEASANCE.

SECT. 37. The mortgages mentioned in this chapter shall i
include not only those made by a common deed of mortgage, }
but also such as are made by a conveyance with a separate 4
deed of defeasance. ‘

MORTGAGES WITH POWER OF SALE.

SECT. 38. When a power of sale is contained in a mort- 1
gage, and a conditional judgment has been entered, the”
demandant may, instead of a writ of possession, have a1
decree entered that the property be sold pursuant to such.
power of sale; and thereupon the demandant shall give
such notices and do all such acts as are authorized and
required by the power, or the court passing the decree.

SECT. 39. The party selling shall within ten days thereafter make a report thereof and of his doings, to the court,
under his oath, and file the same in the clerk’s office, and
the same may be confirmed and allowed, or set aside and a
resale ordered, as to the court shall seem just and lawful.
Any person interested may intervene or be summoned and
heard on such proceedings; and the order of the court
confirming the sale shall be conclusive evidence as against
all persons, that the power of sale was duly executed.

SECT. 40. If the tenant in the action in which such
decree of sale is to be made, shall not be seized in fee simple

in possession of the whole equity of redemption of the land
demanded, no decree for a sale shall be made until all
parties interested in the equity of redemption-, and whose
estate or interest therein would be affected by such sale,
including any married woman having right or possibility of
dower, shall have been summoned to appear and had due
opportunity to be heard according to the order of court.

SECT. 41. Instead of such suit and decree of sale, the
mortgagee, or any person having his estate therein, or
authorized by such power to act in the premises, may upon
a breach of the condition give such notices and do all such
acts as are authorized or required by the power; and he
shall, within thirty days after selling the property in pursuance of the power, file a copy of the notice, and his aflidavit
setting forth his acts in the premises fully and particularly,
in the office of the registry of deeds in the county or district
where the property is situated. The affidavit and copy of
notice shall be recorded by the register, with a note of reference thereto on the margin of the record of the mortgage
deed if recorded in his office.

SECT. 42. If it appears by such affidavit that he has in
all respects complied with the requisitions of the power
of sale, in relation to all things to be done by him before
selling the property, and has sold the same in the manner
required by such power, the affidavit, or a duly certified
office copy of the record thereof, shall be admitted as evidence that the power of sale was duly executed.

SECT. 43. If the mortgage was executed by a man having at that time no lawful wife, or.if being married, the
wife of the mortgagor joined in the deed in token of her
release of dower, the sale of the property in either of the
modes aforesaid shall be effectual to bar all claim and possibility of dower in the property.

SECT. 44. When a mortgage is made or assigned to the
commonwealth, the treasurer may demand and receive the
money due, and upon payment shall make and acknowledge

performed, the treasurer may cause an entry for the breach
of the condition to be made by himself, or by any person
whom he shall appoint for the purpose, in the name and
behalf of the commonwealth, or he may bring an action in
the name of the commonwealth to recover possession of the

SECTION 1. When any person shall unlawfully enter and
intrude upon or hold any lands belonging to the commonwealth, the same may be recovered upon an information
filed and prosecuted by the attorney-general or any districtattorney, in the supreme judicial court in any county,
describing the premises and setting forth the title and claim
of the commonwealth thereto; and a summons shall thereupon issue to the persons therein named as intruders or
trespassers, returnable in the county where the lands lie.

SECT. 2. The service of the summons and all other
proceedings in the suit shall be conducted in the same manner substantially as in real actions between private persons,
unless where a different course is prescribed.

SECT. 3. When the title of the commonwealth is founded
on a forfeiture for the breach of a condition in any grant or
conveyance made by the commonwealth, or by the province
or colony of Massachusetts Bay, no suit therefor shall be
commenced unless by an order of the legislature.

SE01‘. 4. If the claim of the commonwealth is founded
on an escheat for want of heirs of the last owner of the
premises, or on any other title except that of the forfeiture
mentioned in the preceding section, the attorney-general or
district-attorney may commence and prosecute a suit therefor whenever he shall have good reason to believe that the
claim of the commonwealth can be established by proof.

SECT. 5. In case of any supposed escheat, when no person
appears as the heir of the person last seized, and in all cases
when there is reason to suppose that there is any person
claiming any estate or interest in the premises Whose name
is unknown, or who is absent from the state, or cannot be
found therein to be served with process, the court shall, in
addition to any other service, order notice to be given to all
persons interested to appear and answer to the information,
by causing the substance thereof with the order of the court
to be published three weeks successively in such newspaper as the court shall direct, the frrst publication to be
ninety days at least before the time appointed for the
appearance of the parties.

SE01‘. 6. Any person who claims an estate or interest‘
in the premises, though he is not named in the information i
nor served with process, may appear and answer thereto ; but
a defendant who is not named shall not recover costs against
the commonwealth, unless it appears that he has some
estate or interest in the premises, although the common-,
wealth should fail to establish their claim thereto.

SECT. 7. When there are several defendants, the court‘
may award costs for or against any one of them, as the jus- E
tice of the case may require, in like manner as if he were
the sole defendant.

SECT. 8. If the commonwealth prevails in the suit, the
defendant shall be chargeable for the rents and profits,
and be entitled to an allowance for all improvements, in like
manner as is provided in the case of a writ of entry between
private persons.

SECT. 9. The commonwealth shall be deemed and taken
to be actually seized and possessed of the premises as soon
as judgment is rendered in their favor, without a writ of
possession.

SECT. 10. The judgment shall be conclusive between the
commonwealth and the defendants who appear and answer,
and against every person named as a defendant upon whom
the summons has been duly served within the state, and
all persons claiming under such defendants.

SECT. 11_. Any person who is not concluded by a judgment for the commonwealth according to the provisions of
the preceding section, may until his claim is barred by
the law for the limitation of real actions or otherwise,
bring a writ of entry to recover the premises from the
commonwealth or any person who may then hold under
the commonwealth; may deny and disprove any facts
alleged and proved in the first suit, and allege and prove
any other facts in support of his claim; and if it appears
that he is entitled to the premises, shall have judgment
and execution therefor in common form.

S1-:c'r. 12. If the commonwealth continues seized of
the premises at the time when such new action is commenced, it shall be brought against the tenant or occupant
of the premises, and in addition to the service on him a
copy of the original writ or summons shall be left with the
attorney-general or districteattorney fourteen days at least
before the return day, that he may appear and defend the
suit. If the commonwealth has granted away the premises,

the action shall be brought against the tenant of the freehold. In either case it shall be conducted and disposed of
as if no such information had been filed. ~

SECT. 13. The demandant if he recovers, shall be entitled
to the rents and profits, and shall be chargeable for all
improvements, in like manner as is provided in chapter one
hundred and thirty-four, although the premises should not

much as six years. '

SECT. 14. Costs shall be awarded and taxed for the party
prevailing. If the judgment is in favor of the common
wealth, an execution for the costs shall issue in common
form; if it is in favor of the defendant, the costs shall be

council.

SECT. 15. When any person unlawfully enters into,

commonwealth for the use and benefit of any tribe or body
of Indians, or in trustees, guardians, treasurers, or agents,
appointed by or under the authority of the commonwealth
for the use and benefit of such tribe or body, or of any
individuals thereof or their descendants, the same may be
recovered upon an information filed and prosecuted by the
attorney-general or district-attorney in the court of common
pleas for the county where the land is situated.

SECT. 16. The district-attorney for such district shall file
and prosecute such information whenever he has good reason
to believe that the land can be recovered.

SECT. 17. The trial of such information in the common
pleas shall be final, saving to each party the right of exception in matter of law, according to the provisions of chapter
one hundred and thirteen.

SECT. 18. The proceedings in the information and the
effects thereof shall in all respects be conformable to the
preceding provisions of this chapter; but if the final judgment is in favor of the commonwealth a writ of possession
may be sued out and served like a similar writ in other civil
process.

SECT. 19. If in any such proceeding the commonwealth
recovers possession of land to or in which such trustees,
guardians, treasurers, or agents, have title or interest, such
possession shall be deemed to be the possession of such
trustees, guardians, treasurers, or agents, if any are living,

or the supreme judicial court, may be commenced by trustee g
process; except actions of replevin, actions of tort for:
malicious prosecution, for slander either by writing or?
speaking, and for assault and battery; and any person orf

be issued, like other original writs in civil actions.

SECT. 3. It shall be in the form heretofore estab-:
lished, authorizing an attachment of the goods and estate of E

the trustee, and shall be subject to alteration as is provided in chapter one hundred and twenty-three.

SECT. 4. If all the persons named in the writ as trustees
dwell or have usual places of business in one county, the
writ shall be returnable in such county, otherwise it may be
returnable in any county in which either of them dwells

or has his usual place of business, without regard to the
domicil of the other parties.

SE01‘. 5. The attachment of the goods and estate of the
defendant in his own hands and possession, if any, shall be
made in the usual manner, and the Writ shall be further
served on the defendant and each of the trustees in the

manner prescribed for the service of an original summons
without an attachment.

SECT. 6. At any time before the writ is served on
the defendant, the plaintiff may insert the names of
any other trustees, and may cause the writ to be served
on them. After a service on any trustee, the writ may be
served again on the same trustee in like manner and with
the same effect as if he had not been previously served

therewith, if such second service is made before the writ is
served on the defendant.

SECT. 7. If all the trustees are discharged, the plaintiff
shall not proceed in the suit against the defendant unless
there has been legal service of the writ on him, or notice of
the suit, or unless he actually appears and answers thereto.

credits, of the defendant, if any, were in his hands or possession at the time of the service of the writ upon him.

SE01‘. 9. The plaintiff may from time to time examine the supposed trustee upon written interrogatories filed in
the clerk’s office. The answers thereto shall be swo1§ to
and filed in the clerk’s oiiice within seven days after notice

are not so filed, the court may pass such order as the case

may require.

SECT. 10. Corporations summoned as trustees may appear
and answer by their cashier, treasurer, secretary, or such
other officer as they shall appoint or as the court shall
require to attend for that purpose. The answer and examination on oath of such officers or persons shall be received
as the answer and examination of the corporation.

SECT. 11. The answers and statements sworn to by a
trustee shall be considered as true, in deciding how far he is
chargeable, but either party may allege and prove any other
facts not stated nor denied by him, that may be material in
deciding that question.

SECT. 12. Any question of fact arising upon such additional allegations may be tried and determined by the court,
or may be submitted to a jury in such manner as the court
shall direct.

SECT. 13. When a person duly summoned as a trustee
neglects to appear and answer to the suit as herein provided,
he shall be defaulted and adjudged a trustee.

SECT. 14. If a person summoned as trustee, or the executor or administrator of such person, or if an officer, agent,

goods and estate, pay to the plaintiii‘ in the trustee process,
or to his executors or administrators, the full amount due

to be recovered in an action of tort; and he shall moreover on conviction thereof upon indictment, be adjudged

guilty of perjury.

PROCEEDINGS IN RELATION TO ADVERSE CLAIMANTS.

SECT. 15. If it appears that any goods, effects, or credits,
in the hands of a supposed trustee, are claimed by another
person by force of an assignment from the defendant
or otherwise, the court may permit such claimant to appear
and maintain his right. If he does not voluntarily appear,
notice for that purpose may be issued and served on him
in such manner as the court shall direct.

SECT. 16. If such claimant appears, he may be admitted
as a party to the suit so far as respects his title to the
goods, effects, or credits, in question, and may allege and
prove any facts not stated nor denied by the supposed
trustee; and such allegations shall be tried and determined
in the manner before provided.

SECT. 17. Upon the trial of any question arising upon
the additional allegations of a party, any part of the testimony may be given by depositions taken and reduced to
writing in the usual form, and filed in the case, or orally, as
the court shall direct.

PROCEEDINGS WHEN SUIT IS PENDING AGAINST TRUSTEE.

SECT. 18. If during the pendency of an action the
defendant is summoned as the trustee of the plaintiff,
the first suit may nevertheless proceed so far as to
ascertain by a verdict, award, or otherwise, what sum is
due from the defendant. The suit shall not be delayed
on account of the trustee process, unless the court for
good cause shown shall see fit to continue it for judgment until the termination of the trustee suit, or until
the attachment therein shall be dissolved by the discharge
of the trustee, or by the satisfaction of the judgment, or
otherwise.

SECT. 19. ' The court may, on application of the plaintiff
in the trustee process, continue the other suit, on such terms
as they shall deem just and reasonable. If it is not so continued, and judgment is rendered against the defendant,
he shall not_ afterwards be adjudged a trustee on account
of the demand so recovered against him, so long as he is
liable to an execution on the judgment.

SECT. 20. If before final judgment is rendered in the
first suit, the defendant in that suit is adjudged a trustee in
the other, and shall pay thereon the money demanded in
the first suit, or any part thereof, the fact shall be stated on
the record of the first suit, and judgment therein shall be

rendered for the costs due to the plaintiff, and for such part
of the debt or damages as shall remain due and unpaid.

WHEN AND FOR WHAT TRUSTEES ARE CHARGEABLE, &C.

SECT. 21. When a person is summoned as trustee having
goods, effects, or credits, of the defendant intrusted or

when attached by the ordinary process, except as hereinafter
provided.

SECT. 22. Debts, legacies, goods, effects, or credits, due
from, or in the hands of, an executor or administrator

as such, may be so attached in his hands.

SECT. 23. Any dividend of an estate of an insolvent
debtor, if it is not upon a claim for wages which would not

may after the dividend is declared be so attached in the
hands of the assignee.

SECT. 24. Any money or other thing due to the defendant may be attached as herein mentioned before it has
become payable, if it is due absolutely and without any contingency; but the trustee «shall not be compelled to pay or
deliver it before the time appointed by the contract.

SECT. 25. If a person summoned as trustee has in his
possession goods, effects, or credits, of the defendant, which
he holds by a conveyance or title that is void as to the
creditors of the defendant, he may be adjudged a trustee,
although the defendant could not have maintained an action
therefor against him.

SECT. 26. ’Every trustee shall be allowed to retain or
deduct out of the goods, effects, and credits, in his hands,
all demands against the defendant of which he could have
availed himself if he had not been summoned as a trustee,
whether by way of set-off on a trial, or by the set-oil" of judgments or executions between himself and the principal ;
and he shall be liable for the balance only, after all mutual
demands between him and the principal are adjusted.

SECT. 27. In the demands mentioned in the preceding
section to be adjusted between the trustee and the defendant,
there shall not be included on either side any claim for
unliquidated damages for Wrongs or injuries.

SECT. 28. If after the service of process on the trustee, but '
before he has knowledge thereof, he shall in good faith make i
any payment, or become liable to a third person, for or on i
account of the goods, effects, or credits, in his hands, or]
shall have delivered the same to the defendant, or to any 5
other person entitled thereto, he shall be allowed therefor in I
the same manner as if the payment or delivery had been
made, or the liability incurred, before the service of the
writ.

SECT. 29. When the wages for the personal labor and;
services of a defendant are attached for a debt or demand :
other than for necessaries furnished him or his family, and i
when a debt due for the services of the wife or minor children of the defendant is attached, there shall be reserved in
the hands of the trustee a sum notexceeding twenty dollars,
which shall be exempt from such attachment.

SECT. 30. When a savings bank or an institution for;
savings is charged as trustee, and in the opinion of the court 1

the defendant, the court may in its discretion require the :
plaintiff to give bond with surety or sureties to be approved :
by the court, conditioned to save such bank or institution
harmless therefrom.

SECT. 31. No person shall be adjudged a trustee in either
of the cases following, viz :—

First—-By reason of having drawn, accepted, made, or

Second—By reason of ‘any money or other thing received
or collected by him as a sheriff or other oilicer by force of
an execution or other legal process in favor of the defendant

previously demanded of him by the defendant:

Third—By reason of any money in his hands as a public
oiiicer, and for which he is accountable to the defendant
merely as such oilicer:

Fourth—By reason of any money or other thing due from
him to the defendant, unless it is at the time of the service
of the writ on him due absolutely and without depending
on any contingency: nor

Fifth—By reason of a debt due from him on a judgment,
so long as he is liable to an execution thereon.

JUDGMENT, EXECUTION, AND SCIRE FACIAS.

SECT. 32. When a person is adjudged trustee in the
original suit, it shall not be necessary to specify in the
judgment the sum for which he is chargeable; but if upon

a writ of scire facias against him, it appears that he is
chargeable as trustee, the sum shall be expressed in the
judgment.

SECT. 33. If after a person is adjudged trustee, the
goods, effects, and credits, in his hands, shall not be demanded of him, by force of the execution, within thirty days after
final judgment, they shall be liable to another attachment,
whether made before or after the judgment, in like manner
as if such prior attachment had not been made.

SECT. 34. If there is no such second attachment, the
defendant in the suit may recover them, if not demanded
as aforesaid within said thirty days, in like manner as if they
had not been attached. , '

SECT. 35. If no such second attachment is made of the
same goods, effects, and credits, and no action is brought
therefor by the defendant, and if they shall not have been
paid or delivered to him before they are demanded of the
trustee by the officer, the trustee shall be liable to pay and
deliver the same, when so demanded, although it should be
after the expiration of said thirty days.

S1-:c'r. 36. If‘ the trustee cannot be found in the state by
the officer to whom the execution is committed for service,
a copy of the execution may be left at his dwelling-house
or last and usual place of abode, with a notice to him
indorsed thereon and signed by the officer, signifying that
he is required to pay and deliver, towards satisfying the
execution, the goods, effects, and credits, for which he is
liable; and this shall be deemed a sufficient demand, for all
the purposes expressed in the three preceding sections.

SECT. 37. The judgment, against a trustee shall acquit
and discharge him from all demands by the defendant, or
his executors or administrators, for all goods, effects, and
credits, paid, delivered, or accounted for, by the trustee, by
force of such judgment.

SECT. 38. If a person summoned as trustee is discharged,
the judgment shall be no bar to an action brought against
him by the defendant for the same demand.

SECT. 39. If a person wh'o is adjudged a trustee in the
original suit shall not pay over to the ofiicer, upon demand,
goods, effects, or credits, sufficient to satisfy the execution,
and if the execution is not otherwise satisfied, the plaintiff
may sue out a writ of so-ire facias against all or a separate
writ against each of the trustees, from the court in

which the judgment was rendered, to show cause why
judgment and execution should not be awarded against him
and his own goods and estate, for the sum remaining
unsatisfied on the judgment against the defendant.

SECT. 40. If a trustee duly served with the scire facias
neglects to appear and answer, he shall be defaulted; and
if he shall not have been examined in the original suit,
judgment shall be rendered against him upon such default,
for the whole sum remaining unsatisfied on the judgment
against the defendant.

SECT. 41. If a trustee who is defaulted on the scire
facias has been examined in the original suit, judgment in the scire facias shall be rendered upon the facts
stated in that examination, or proved in the trial that
may have been had thereon, for such part, if any, as shall
remain in his hands, of the goods, effects, or credits, for
which he was originally chargeable as a trustee, or for so
much thereof as shall be then remaining unsatisfied on the
judgment against the defendant.

SECT. 42. If the trustee appears and answers to the
scire facias, and if he had not been examined in the original
suit, he shall be liable to be examined in the same manner
as he might have been in that suit; and if he had been
examined in the original suit, the court may require or
permit him to be examined anew in the suit on the scire
facias. In either case he shall be permitted to answer and
prove any matter that may be necessary or proper for his
defence in the suit on the scire facias. Upon the whole
matter appearing upon such examination and trial the court
shall render such judgment as law and justice require.

SECT. 43. No writ of scire facias shall be maintained
against a person adjudged trustee unless served upon him
within two years after the rendition of judgment in the
original suit; except that if the money or other thing is
not payable when the judgment is rendered, said writ may
be maintained if served within one year after payment
becomes due.

DEATH OF PARTIES.

SECT. 44. If a person summoned as trustee in his own
right dies before the judgment recovered by the plaintiff is
fully satisfied, the goods, effects, and credits, in his hands at
the time of the attachment, shall remain bound thereby, and
his executors or administrators shall be liable therefor in

like manner as if the writ had been originally served on
them.

SECT. 45. If he dies before judgment in the original suit,
his executor or administrator may appear voluntarily, or
may be cited to appear, as in other cases. The further
proceedings shall then be conducted in the same manner
as if the executor or administrator had been originally summoned as trustee, except that the examination of the deceased,
if any is filed, shall have the same effectas if he were living.

SECT. 46. If the executor or administrator does not
appear, the plaintiff, instead of suggesting the death of the
trustee, may take judgment against him by default or otherwise as if, he were living, and the executor or administrator
shall pay on the execu'tion the amount which he would have
been liable to pay to the defendant, and shall be thereby
discharged for the amount so paid, in like manner as if
the executor or administrator had been himself adjudged
trustee.

SECT. 47. If in the case last mentioned the executor or
administrator does not voluntarily pay the amount in his
hands, the plaintiff may proceed against him by a writ of
scirefacias, as if the judgment in the first suit had been
against him as trustee.

SECT. 48. If the person originally summoned as trustee
dies after judgment in the original action, the executor or
administrator may pay on the execution the amount which
the deceased would have been liable to pay if living, and
he shall be discharged from all further demands on account
thereof, in the manner before mentioned. If he refuses so
to do, the plaintiff may proceed against him by a writ of
sci-re facias, in the manner provided in the preceding
section. ‘

SECT. 49. If a person against whom execution issues as
trustee is not living at the expiration of thirty days after
final judgment in the trustee suit, the demand to be made
for the purpose of holding the attachment, may be made
of the executor or administrator of the deceased person, at
any time within thirty days after his appointment; and
shall have the same effect as if made within thirty days
after the judgment.

SECT. 50. When an executor or administrator is adjudged
trustee for or on account of goods, effects, or credits, in his
hands or possession merely as such executor or administrator, whether in a suit originally commenced against him
as trustee, or against the deceased testator or intestate,
and whether the judgment be in the original suit or on ‘a
writ of scire facias, the execution shall not be served on his

own goods or estate, nor on his person, but he shall be
liable for the amount in his hands, in like manner and to
the same extent only as he would have been’ to the defendant, if there had been no trustee process. °

S1-:c'r. 51. If after final judgment against an executorl
or administrator for a certain sum due from him as trustee, he neglects to pay the same, the original plaintiff in
the trustee process shall have the same remedy for recovering the amount, either upon a suggestion of waste or
by a suit on the administration bond, as the defendant in
the trustee process would have had upon a judgment recovered by himself for the same demand against the executor
or administrator. r

PROCEEDINGS WHEN TRUSTEE HAS SPECIFIC GOODS.

SECT. 52. When a person is charged as trustee by reason
of goods or chattels, other than money, which he holds or y
is bound to deliver to the defendant, he shall deliver the
same, or as much thereof as may be necessary, to the officer
who holds the execution ; and the goods shall be sold by the
ofiicer, and the proceeds applied and accounted for in the
> same manner as if they had been taken on an execution in
common form.

SECT. 53. The value of any goods so delivered, shall be
ascertained and fixed, as between the trustee and defendant,
in like manner and upon the same principles as if they had
been delivered to the defendant. Upon the application of
either party the court may, either pending the original suit
or upon the scire facias, determine the value, and make any
other order in relation to such goods and the delivery
thereof that may be necessary or proper to protect the rights
of the trustee and defendant.

SE01‘. 54. When a person summoned as trustee is bound
by contract to deliver specific goods to the defendant at
a certain time and place, he shall not be compelled by
reason of the trustee process to deliver them at any other
time or place; and he may notwithstanding such process
tender or deliver them to the person entitled under the contract, at the time and place therein mentioned, unless he
shall have been previously adjudged a trustee on account
thereof.

SECT. 55. When it appears that such goods in the hands
of a person summoned as trustee are mortgaged or pledged,
or in any way liable for the payment of a debt to him, the
attaching creditor may be allowed, under an order of the

court for that purpose, to pay or tender the amount due to
the trustee; and he shall thereupon deliver the goods in
the manner before provided to the officer who holds the
execution.

SECT. 56. If the goods in such case are held for any
purpose other than to secure the payment of money, and
if the contract, condition, or other thing, to be performed, is
such as can be performed’ by the attaching creditor without
damage to the other parties, the court may make an order
for the performance thereof by him. Upon such performance, or a tender, the trustee shall deliver the goods in the
manner before provided to the officer who holds the
execution.

SECT. 57. All goods received by the officer under the
two preceding sections, shall be sold and disposed of in
the same manner as if they had been taken on an execution
in common form; except that from the proceeds of the sale
the otlicer shall repay to the attaching creditor the amount
paid by him to the trustee for the redemption of the goods,
with interest thereon, or shall indemnify the creditor for
such other act or thing as he shall have done or performed
pursuant to the order of the court for the redemption of
the goods.

SECT. 58. Nothing contained in the preceding sections
shall prevent the trustee from selling the goods in his hands
for the payment of the demand for which they are mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise liable, at any time before the
amount due to him shall be paid or tendered as before
mentioned; if such sale would be authorized as between
him and the defendant.

SECT. 59. If a trustee refuses or neglects to deliver any
goods in his hands when thereunto lawfully required by the
officer who serves the execution, he shall, after deducting
the amount of any lien he may have thereon, be liable to the
plaintiff in the action for the value thereof, to be recovered
as money is recovered when not paid on the first execution
pursuant to the judgment against a trustee.

COSTS .

SECT. 60. If a person summoned as trustee appears and

counsel fees and other necessary expenses as the court
shall deem reasonable.

S1-3c'r. 61. If he is adjudged trustee, his costs and
charges shall be deducted and retained out of the goods,
effects, and credits, in his hands, and he shall be chargeable
for the balance only to be paid on the execution. If such
goods, effects, and credits, are not of sufficient value to discharge the cost taxed in his favor, he shall_ have judgment
and execution against the plaintiff for the balance of such
costs, after deducting the sum disclosed, in the same manner
as if he had been discharged.

SECT. 62. If he is discharged for any cause, his costs
and charges shall be paid by the plaintiff, and he shall
have judgment and execution therefor.

SECT. 63. If the person summoned as trustee is out of
the state at the time of the service of the original writ on
him, and appears and answers at the first term after his
return, he shall be allowed for his costs and charges in the
same manner as if he had appeared at the term when the
action was entered.

SECT. 64. If the person so summoned does not dwell or
have a usual place of business in the county in which the
writ is returnable, he shall in all cases be allowed his costs
and charges, which shall be retained or recovered as before
provided, whether he appears at the first or at any other
term, and whether in the original suit or upon a scire
facias against him.

‘ SECT. 65. If a person summoned as trustee who dwells
or has his usual place of business in the county in which
the writ is returnable, shall without any reason which the
court shall deem sufficient, neglect to appear and answer
within the time herein provided, he shall be liable if‘ the
plaintiff recovers judgment in the suit, and his costs are
not otherwise recovered and received by him, for all costs
for the plaintifI"s travel and term fees, until he appears.

SECT. 66. If he does not voluntarily pay the amount
when demanded by the officer who serves the execution, the
ofiicer shall state the fact in his return, and if it also appears

goods and estate, whether he is finally adjudged a trustee
or not, except as hereinafter provided.

SECT. 69. If it appears that the person so defaulted had
in his hands goods, effects, or credits, liable to the attachment, and that he has paid and delivered the whole amount
thereof on the execution issued on the original judgment,
he shall not be liable for costs on the scire facias, nor shall
he be entitled to recover costs.

SECT. 70. If the person so defaulted was prevented from
appearing in the original suit by his absence from the state,
or for any other reason which the court shall deem sufficient,
he shall not be liable for costs on the scire facias, but the
court may, if it appears to them reasonable, allow him his
costs and charges for travel and term fees, counsel fees and
other necessary expenses, to be retained or recovered in
like manner as if he had appeared in the original suit.

SECT. 71. If a person summoned as trustee is held liable
to pay from his own estate the costs on the scire facias as
before provided, and if he is ‘at the same time liable for the
costs for the plaintilf’s travel and term fees in the original
suit, one execution shall be issued against him for both
sums.

SECT. 72. When there are several trustees liable to the
writ of some facias, if the plaintiff without reasons which
the court shall deem suflicient, sues out two or more writs,
when he might have joined all the trustees in one writ,
he shall recover no more costs than if he had sued out only
one writ, and the court may apportion the costs equally
and proportionally among all the trustees liable therefor.

SECT. 73. When an adverse claimant is admitted as a
party, the court may award costs between him and the
attaching creditor and supposed trustee, or either of them,
as justice and equity require.

SECT. 74. If the wages for the personal labor and services
of a person are attached by the trustee process, and the

as debt, he shall recover no costs of suit.

of common pleas.

SECT. 78. N 0 person shall be held to answer as a trustee
in an action before a justice of the peace, or police or justices’ court, in any other county than that in which he

on him and does not return before the final judgment in
the suit, he shall not be chargeable as trustee.

the creditor, or the service of his execution delayed, by
reason of the replevin: and

recover judgment in the suit in which the attachment was
made, or if any balance shall remain of the moneys so
recovered by the officer after paying what is due to the

same manner as would and ought to have been done with

consequence of such amendment, the cause shall be tried
upon such new issue.

the damage that may be thereafter occasioned by the dam in
question ; and if the complainant does not accept the same,

annual compensation than was so offered, be entitled to his
costs up to the time of the tender, and the respondent shall
be entitled to recover his costs afterwards.

the preceding section consents to accept the amount so
offered for the past damage and future annual compensation,

attached or taken on execution, in like manner as if it proceeded from a sale made by the officer on an execution.

SECT. 28. If the interest of the owner in‘ the building,

before his right of action accrued or after it was barred, or
if he becomes nonsuit, or fails to establish his claim,'the
suit may be prosecuted by any other creditor having such
lien, in the same manner as if it had been originally commenced by him, if the circumstances of the case are such
that he might then, or at any time after the commencement
of the original suit, have commenced a like suit on his own
claim.

SECT. 38. If the suit is commenced by the petitioning
creditor before his right of action accrues, his claim may
nevertheless be allowed, if the suit is carried on by any

or libellant, and the respondent may defend as to each
petitioner or libellant, in the same manner as if they had
severally petitioned or libelled for their individual liens.

SECT. 17. When there is money due to more than one
person holding alien upon a ship or vessel under the provisions of this chapter, all parties interested having been
cited to appear and answer, the claims of all shall be
marshalled, and the court shall make such order or decree
as shall be necessary to prevent the enforcement of a
double lien for the same labor, materials, stores, provisions,
or other articles, and to secure the just rights of all. And
the proceeds arising from the sale of such ship or vessel,
after deducting all proper costs and expenses, shall be distributed among the several claimants to the amount of
their respective debts: provided, that when such proceeds
are insufficient to satisfy the liens of all, those having liens
for labor shall receive a percentage on their respective

claims one-third greater, as near as may be, than those
having liens for materials, stores, or other articles.

SECT. 18. The five preceding sections shall not affect the
lien as now existing on foreign ships and vessels ; nor shall
they be construed to give the courts of this state exclusive
jurisdiction of the liens created hereby; but the same may

the course of proceedings in such courts.

SECT. 23. If the owner makes default at the time
appointed, or if upon a hearing of the parties it shall

appear that a lien exists upon the property, and that the
same ought to be sold for the satisfaction of the debt, the
justice or court may make an order for that purpose, and if
no appeal is taken, the property may be sold in conformity
therewith. Any surplus of the proceeds of sale, after

satisfying the debt and all costs and charges, shall be paid
to the owner upon demand.

debt with costs which may remain unsatisfied after a sale
of the property, if judgment shall be rendered against him.

SECT. 26. The prevailing party shall recover his costs,
and the justice or court may issue execution therefor.

SECT. 27. The preceding sections shall not limit or
restrict the right of any party having a lien upon property,

to hold and dispose of the same in any other manner

the manner hereinafter mentioned, for the payment of a

SECT. 4. The recognizance shall be attested by the clerk,
whether taken in term time or vacation, and shall be recorded at length by him among the records of the court,

SEC'r.- 6. Before such execution issues, the original recognizance shall be filed with the clerk, who shall compute the
amount, deducting any payments indorsed; he shall then
issue execution, which shall recite the recognizance, state
the amount then due, and otherwise be in the usual form
of an execution on a judgment for debt. It may be issued
by the clerk without any special order of the court.

SECT. 7. A recognizance for debt may be taken before
a justice of the peace, or police or justices’ court, in any
case where it might be taken before the clerk of the court.
It shall be substantially in the same form, recorded in a
book kept for the purpose, and delivered to the conusee; and
execution may be issued thereon by the justice or court.
Such executions shall have the same effect as executions
issued by the clerk, except that where the recognizance is
for twenty dollars or less, the execution shall not run
against the lands of the conusee.

SE01‘. 8. Executions issued under this chapter may be
executed and shall be obeyed in every county to which
they are directed.

exhibiting to the clerk or justice his letters testamentary or
of administration; and the form of the execution shall be
altered accordingly.

SECT. 10. If the conusor dies before the debt is fully
paid, no execution therefor shall be issued as of course,
but the estate of the conusor in the hands of his executors,
administrators, heirs, or devisees, shall be liable for the
debt in like manner as if judgment therefor had been
recovered against him in his lifetime; and the conusee,
his executors, or administrators, may have a scire facias, or
an action of contract, to recover the same against the executors, administrators, heirs, or devisces, of the conusor, in
like manner as they might have had upon such a judgment.

expired by its own limitation, notwithstanding any forfeiture
thereof for which he might have entered at an earlier time:

from entering when entitled to do so by reason of any
forfeiture or breach of condition, but if he claims under
