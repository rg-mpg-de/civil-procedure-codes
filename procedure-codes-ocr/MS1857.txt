proceedings in the suit, in which such judgment or decree shall be
rendered, any verdict, bond, bill, note, or other writing of the like
nature or kind, whereby such judgment or deoree may · be safely
amended, it shall be the duty of the court in which such judgment
shall be rendered, and of the judge thereof, in vacation, to amend

cases, the appellee, or defendant in error, shall par the costs, and the
judgment.shall not be entered against the sureties in the appeal or 
writ of error bond.
