erty is concerned, in the same manner as if he had been made a
party to and appeared, in such suit, and the decree therein made
against him as one of the defendants therein; but such person,

DISTRESS.

6. Whereas, the most usual and ready way for recovery of
arrears of rent is by distress, yet such distresses not being to be
sold, but only detained as pledges for enforcing the payment of
such rent, the persons distraining have little benefit thereby;

tels shall be distrained for any rent reserved and due upon any
demise, lease, or contract whatsoever, and the tenant or owner
of the goods so distrained shall not, within ten days next after such

left at the chief mansion-house or other most notorious place on
the premises, charged with the rent distrained for, replevy the
same with sufficient security to be given to the sheriff, according
to law, that then in such case, after such distress and notice as
aforesaid and expiration of the said ten days, the person dis
training shall and may, on two days' notice to the tenant, with
the sheriff or undersheriff of the county, or with the constable
of the township, precinct, or place, where such distress shall be
taken (who are hereby required to be aiding and assisting therein),
cause the goods and-chattels, so distrained, to be inventoried
and appraised by three sworn appraisers (whom such sheriff,
undersheriff, or constable, are hereby empowered to summon for
that service, and to swear, well and truly to appraise the same,
at the true and intrinsic value thereof, according to the best of
their understanding), and after such inventory and appraisement
shall and may lawfully sell, at public vendue, the goods and
chattels so distrained (giving five days' public notice by adver
tising the articles to be sold, and the time and place of sale, in
at least three of the most public places in the township where
such distress shall be made), for the best price that can be gotten
for the same, towards satisfaction of the rent for which the said
goods and chattels shall be distrained, and of the charges of
such distress, appraisement, and sale, leaving the overplus, if
any, in the hands of such sheriff:', undersheriff, or constable for
the owner's use.

directed, shall be commanded, that of the goods and chattels in
his county, of the party against whom such execution issues, he

the day particularly, or at any time afterwards, in whose hands
soever the same may then be ; but when such execution shall
be issued against terre tenants, or heirs or devisees (unless they
shall have made their estate liable by false pleading or other
wise), it shall only command the sheriff or other officer, that of
the lands, tenements, hereditaments, and real estate, whereof
the ancestor, testator, or person deceased, was seized on the day
when the said lands, tenements, hereditaments, and real estate
became liable as aforesaid, or at any time afterwards, or at the
time of his or her death, as the case may require, he cause to be
made the debt, damages, and costs or sum of money in the said
writ mentioned
2. Every writ of execution which shall be sued forth against
lands, tenements, hereditaments, and real estate, shall, before it
be delivered to the sheriff or other officer, be recorded in a book

under the authority of the United states, belonging to the de
fendant in execution, may be taken and sold by virtue of such
execution, in the same manner as goods and chattels.

notice that he, the said sheriff or other officer, holds such writ
of execution, and out of what court, at whose suit, for what
amount, and against whose goods and chattels, such writ has
been issued, and that by virtue of said writ, he, the said sheriff

and on the same day to serve like notice in writing upon the
president and directors of said company, or upon such of them
as reside in his county, either personally or by leaving the same
at their respective places of abode ; and the sending, setting up,
and serving of such notices in the manner aforesaid, shall con

wilfully send a false certificate, he shall be liable to the plaintiff
for double the amount of all damages occasioned by such neglect

against him ; but the neglect to send, or miscarriage of such
certificate, shall not impair the validity of the levy upon the
stock.

rights to unlocated lands, shall be and hereby are made liable
to be levied upon and sold by executions, to be issued on judg

levied upon and sold ; but every such execution shall issue out
of the supreme court, and if the said shares or rights be within
the western division, shall be directed to the sheriff of the county

place of residence when the appraisement by the said appraisers
is completed and cannot readily be found, or shall refuse to make

day, that which was first delivered shall be first executed and
satisfied.
19. Where sundry writs of execution shall be issued against
the goods and chattels, lands, tenements, hereditaments, and
real estate of the same person, and sufficient cannot be found
to satisfy all the sums commanded to be made, then the like

shall protect the said sheriff from any action, for taking and
seizing such property or delivery thereof to the claimant ; and
if the said property shall be found to belong to the claimant,
the sheriff shall proceed no further with the same ; but if it shall
be found to belong to the defendant, he shall proceed to dispose
thereof as is directed in such process ; and the costs attending
such trial shall be taxed by the said judge as in other cases, and
shall be paid by the plaintiff at whose suit the said property was
taken and seized, if the claimant obtain a verdict in his favor,
and by such claimant, if the verdict is found against him ; pro
vided, that if the plaintiff, upon notice being given to him as
aforesaid, shall indemnify the sheriff against the demand of
the claimant, then he shall suspend any further proceedings
therein, and proceed to sell.

ment or other process issued upon any such order, be deemed an
execution within the meaning of this section.

C—THE SERVICE OF THE WRIT.
9. Every writ of habeas corpus issued under this act, may be
served by delivering the same to the person to whom it is
directed ; if he cannot be found, it may be served by being left
at the jail or other place in which the prisoner may be confined,
with an under officer, or other person of proper age, having
charge for the time, of such prisoner.
10. If the person upon whom such writ ought to be served,
conceals himself, or refuses admittance to the party attempting
to serve the same, it may be served by affixing the same in some
conspicuous place on the outside, either of his dwelling-house,
or of the place where the party is confined.
11. The service of the writ shall not be deemed complete,
unless the party serving the same shall tender to the person in
whose custody the prisoner may be, if such person be a sheriff,
coroner, constable, marshal, keeper of the jail, or other officer,
the fees allowed by law for bringing up such prisoner, together
with the charges for carrying him back ; nor unless he shall
give bond to such sheriff, coroner, constable, marshal, or other
officer, as the case may be, when, in the order allowing such
writ, a bond is required to be given, in a penalty double the
amount of the sum for which such prisoner shall be detained, if
he be detained for any specific sum of money, and if not, then
in the penalty of one thousand dollars conditioned that such
prisoner will not escape by the way, either in going to, or re
turning from, the place to which he is to be taken ; and if said
prisoner shall be discharged, such officer shall repay the moneys,
which he may have received, for the charges of carrying back
such prisoner.
12. But the last section shall not apply to any case where the
writ is sued out by the attorney-general, or by any prosecutor
of the pleas, or where the court or justice acts therein on his
own motion.

310

HABEAS CORPUS.

13. It shall be the duty of every sheriff, coroner, constable,
marshal, or keeper of the jail, or other officer, upon whom a
writ of habeas corpus shall be served, whether such writ be
directed to him or not, upon payment or tender of the charges
allowed by law as aforesaid, and the delivery or tender of the
bond herein prescribed, whenever such bond is requisite, to obey
and return such writ according to the exigency thereof ; and it
shall be the duty of every other person upon whom such writ
shall be served, having the custody of the individual for whose
benefit the writ shall be issued, to obey and execute such writ,
according to the command thereof, without requiring any bond
or the payment of any charges, unless the payment of such
charges shall have been required by the officer issuing such writ.

D.—THE RETURN OF THE WRIT, AND THE PROCEED
INGS THEREUPON.
14. The person upon whom any such writ shall have been
duly served, shall return the same forthwith according to the
command thereof ; if the place at which the prisoner is to be pro
duced Be within twenty miles of the place of service of the writ,
such return shall be made and such prisoner shall be produced
within twenty-four hours ; and the like time shall be allowed
for every additional twenty miles.
15. The return shall state plainly and unequivocally :
I. Whether he has or has not the party in his custody or
under his power or restraint ;
II. If he has the party in his custody or power, or under his
restraint, the authority and true cause of such imprisonment or
restraint, setting forth the same at large;
III. If the party be detained by virtue of any writ, warrant,
or other written authority, a copy thereof shall be annexed to
his return ; and the original shall be produced and exhibited on
the return of the writ, to the court or justice before whom the
same is returnable;
IV. If the person upon whom such writ shall have been
served, shall have had the party in his power or custody, or
under his restraint, but has transferred such custody or restraint

HABEAS CORPUS.

311

to another, the return shall state particularly to whom, at what
time, for what cause, and by what authority such transfer took
place ; the return must be signed by the person making the
same, and except where such person shall be a sworn public
officer, and shall make his return in his official capacity, it shall
be verified by his oath.
16. If, upon the return coming in, the court or justice shall
deem it advisable so to do, he may examine under oath the
officer or person making such return, with respect to the sub
ject-matter thereof.
17. If a writ of habeas corpus be issued, the officer or person
on whom it shall have been served, shall also bring in the body
of the person in his custody, according to the command of such
writ, except in the case of the sickness of such person, as here
inafter provided.
18. If the person upon whom such writ of habeas corpus shall
have been duly served shall refuse or neglect to obey the same,
by producing the party named in such writ of habeas corpus,
and making a full and explicit return thereto, within the time
required by this act, and no sufficient cause be shown for such
refusal or neglect, it shall be the duty of the court or justice
before whom such writ has been made returnable, upon due
proof of the service thereof, forthwith to issue an attachment
against such person, directed to the sheriff of any county
within this State, and commanding him forthwith to apprehend
such person, and to bring him immediately before such court or
justice; and on such person being so brought, he shall be com
mitted to close custody, in the jail of the county in which such
court or justice shall be, until he shall make return to such writ,
and comply with any order that may be made by such court or
justice in relation to the person for whose relief such writ shall
have been issued.
19. If a sheriff of any county shall have neglected to return
such writ, the attachment may be directed to any coroner, or
other person, to be designated therein, who shall have full power
to execute the same ; and such sheriff, upon being brought up,
may be committed to the jail of any county other than his own.
20. The court or justice by whom any such attachment may be

312

HABEAS CORPUS.

issued, may also, at the same time or afterwards, issue a precept
to the same sheriff, or other person to whom such attachment
shall have been directed, commanding him to bring forthwith
before such court or justice, the party for whose benefit such
writ of habeas corpus shall have been allowed ; who shall there
after remain in the custody of such sheriff or person, until he
shall be discharged, bailed, or remanded, as such court or justice
shall direct.
21. In the execution of such attachment or precept, or either
of them, the sheriff or other person to whom they shall be di
rected, may call to his aid the power of the county as in other
cases.

E. THE HEARING ON THE RETURN OF WRIT AND
ORDER TO DISCHARGE OR REMAND.
22. The court or justice before whom the party shall be
brought on such writ of habeas corpus, shall immediately
after the return thereof, proceed to examine said return and the
facts as set forth therein, whether the same shall have been
upon process or commitment for any criminal, or supposed
criminal matter or not.
23. If no cause be shown for such imprisonment or restraint,
or for the continuation thereof- such court or justice shall dis
charge such party from the custody or restraint under which
he is held ; but if the party be not entitled to his discharge,
and be not bailed, the court or justice shall remand him to the
custody, or place him under the restraint, from which he was
taken, if the person under whose custody he was, be legally en
titled thereto ; if not so entitled, he shall be committed by such
court or justice, to the custody of such other officer or person,
as by law is entitled thereto.
24. If it appears that the party has been arrested or com
mitted for some criminal offence, or supposed criminal offence,
it shall be lawful for the court or justice in its or his discretion,
to inquire into the cause and grounds of the confinement or re
straint of such party ; and for this purpose may summon wit
nesses and take their depositions ; and may by an order in writ

HABEAS CORPUS.

313

ing require, of any person, the production of all affidavits,
documents, and writings relative to the premises; and if upon
such examination it shall appear that such party is not entitled
to his discharge, he shall be bailed or remanded in the manner
directed in the next preceding section ; when this course is taken
the party shall not be entitled to his discharge by reason of any
informality or insufficiency in the original arrest or commit
ment.
25. When it appears by the return, or otherwise, that the
prisoner is in custody by virtue of civil process, issued out of
any court of law or equity in this State, whether such process
be a capias ad respondendum or capias ad satisfaciendum, or
other precept whatsoever, in any action of debt, or other action
or proceeding, founded on contract, express or implied, it shall
be lawful for the said court or justice to make an order for the
taking of testimony concerning the truth of the affidavit, or
affidavits, and proofs upon which the order for said writ was
made, and said writ was issued ; which testimony shall be taken
orally before said court or justice, or in writing before any su
preme court commissioner ; which testimony, when taken be
fore such commissioner, shall be filed in the office of the clerk
of the supreme court; and if from the testimony so taken, the
said court or justice shall be of opinion that the said writ was
improperly or improvidently issued, or should not have been
issued, against the defendant therein, the said court or justice
shall order the defendant to be discharged ; in case said im
prisonment shall be upon a capias ad respondendum, the said
court or justice may order the defendant to be discharged upon
common bail, and may take such order for his discharge from
arrest or imprisonment, and the discharge of his bail, as the
nature of the case may require, and as may be deemed equita
ble and just.
26. That when any person is arrested or detained by virtue
of the process mentioned in the preceding section, he shall have
a right to a writ of habeas corpus as provided for in this act.
27. When it appears, on the return of a writ of habeas corpus,
that the party named therein is in custody on any civil process,
under which any other person has an interest in continuing his
21

314

HABEAS CORPUS.

imprisonment or restraint, no order shall be made for his dis
charge until it shall appear that the party so interested, or his
attorney, if he have one, shall have such notice of the hearing
under such habeas corpus as the court or justice allowing the
same shall direct.
28. All persons who are or may be in confinement on a charge
of a criminal offence, which is of a bailable nature, shall be en
titled to a writ of habeas corpus, as provided for in this act, for
the purpose of putting in such bail ; and, if, upon the return of
said writ, it shall appear that the prisoner is entitled to be
bailed, the said court or justice, within two days at the farthest
after such return, shall discharge said prisoner from his impris
onment, taking his recognizance, with one or more surety or
sureties, in any sum at the discretion of said court or justice,
having regard to the quality of the prisoner and the nature of
the offence, for his appearance in the supreme court the term
following, or at the next session of the court of oyer and ter
miner and general jail delivery of and for such county or place,
where the commitment was, or where the offence was com
mitted, or in such other court, where the said offence is properly
cognizable, as the case shall require, and shall then certify the
said writ with the return thereof, and the said recognizance or
recognizances, unto the said court, where such appearance is to
be made.
29. When any person, who is imprisoned or who is under re
straint, is desirous of testing the validity of the same, or of
being discharged upon bail, without being brought in person
before the said court or justice, he shall signify such desire in
his petition for the writ ; and thereupon, in the allowance of
the said writ, a waiver of the production of the body shall be
inserted ; the ret urn, and all other proceedings in other respects,
shall be the same as in other cases, with the exception as to the
mode of taking bail, which may be taken, in the discretion of
the said court or justice, in the manner provided for in the next
following section.
30 In case of proceedings by force of the next preceding sec
tion, if it shall appear that the prisoner should not be discharged,
but is entitled to be admitted to bail, the said court or justice,

HABEAS CORPUS.

315

if it is deemed advisable so to do, is hereby empowered to direct,
in writing, the sum for which such person shall be held to bail,
and the court, and at what term thereof, at which he shall be
required to appear ; and in the same order shall authorize a
supreme court commissioner to take the recognizance of the
person so imprisoned, and of two sufficient sureties, in the sum
so specified, with a condition for the appearance of such pris
oner at the court designated in such order, and that he will not
depart from such court without leave ; but previous to taking
such recognizance, such commissioner shall be satisfied, by the
oath of the persons ottering themselves as sureties, that they
are residents in the county in which the court, before which the
prisoner is to appear, is held, and are severally worth double the
sum in which they shall be required to be bound, over and above
all demands against them ; and such recognizance so taken,
shall be as valid and ettectual as though legally taken before
the supreme court.
31. The said supreme court commissioner shall file the said
recognizance, and the order by virtue of which the same has
been taken, with the clerk of the court before which the pris
oner shall be bound to appear, and shall certify on such order,
under his official signature, the compliance therewith ; the
production of such order, bo certified, or a copy thereof duly
certified under the hand of said clerk, shall entitle such prisoner
to be discharged from imprisonment for the cause mentioned
therein.
32. Until judgment be given upon the return to a habeas
corpus, the court or justice before whom such party shall be
brought may either commit such party to the custody of the
sheritt' of the county in which said court or justice shall be, or
place him in such care or under such custody as the circum
stances of the case may require.
33. Whenever, from the sickness or infirmity of the person
directed to be produced by any writ of habeas corpus, such per
son cannot, without danger, be brought before the court or jus
tice, the party in whose custody he is may state that fact in his
return, verifying the same by his oath ; and if such court or
justice be satisfied of the truth of such allegation, and the re

316

HABEAS CORPUS.

turn be otherwise sufficient, he shall proceed to decide upon
such return, and to dispose of the matter, in the same manner
as if such person had been produced.

F.—EFFECT OF DISCHARGE; PENALTIES, ETC
34. No person who has been discharged by the order of said
court or justice, upon a habeas corpus issued pursuant to the
provisions of this act, shall be again imprisoned, restrained, or
kept in custody for the same cause ; but it shall not be deemed
the same cause—
I. If he shall have been discharged from a commitment on
a criminal charge, and be afterwards committed for the same
offence, by the legal order or process of the court wherein he
shall be bound by recognizance to appear, or in which he shall
be indicted or convicted for the same offence; or,
II. If after a discharge for defect or proof, or for any material
defect in the commitment, in a criminal case, the prisoner be
again arrested on sufficient proof, and committed by legal pro

III. If, in a civil suit, the party has been discharged for any
illegality in the judgment or process, hereinbefore specified, and
is afterwards imprisoned by legal process for the same cause of
action; or,
IV. If, in a civil suit, he shall have been discharged from com
mitment on mesne process, and shall afterwards be committed
on execution, in the same cause, or on mesne process, in any
other cause, after such first suit shall have been discontinued; or,
V. If the prisoner, having been discharged, shall be recom
mitted, on a reversal of the order of discharge, by a court hav
ing the right to review such order.
35. If any person, either solely or as a member of any court,
or in the execution of any order, judgment or process, shall
knowingly recommit, imprison, or restrain of his liberty, or
cause to be recommitted, imprisoned, or restrained of his liberty,
for the same cause, except as provided in the last section, any
person so discharged, or who shall knowingly aid or assist
therein, he shall forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of four

HABEAS CORPUS.

317

teen hundred dollars, to be recovered in an action of debt in any
court having jurisdiction thereof, and shall be guilty of a mis
demeanor.
36. If any one having in his custody or under his power any
person for whose relief a writ of habeas corpus shall have been
duly issued, pursuant to the provisions of this act, who, with
intent to elude the service of such writ, or to avoid the effect
thereof, shall transfer such prisoner to the custody, or place him
under the power or control of another, or conceal him, or change
the place of his confinement, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
37. Every person who shall knowingly aid or assist in the
violation of either of the last two preceding sections, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
38. If any officer or other person shall neglect or refuse to
make the returns aforesaid, or any of them, or to bring the body
of the prisoner according to the command of the said writ, or,
upon demand made by the prisoner, or by any person in his be
half, shall refuse to deliver, or within the space of six hours
after demand, shall not deliver to the person so demanding a
true copy of the warrant or warrants of commitment and de
tainer of such prisoner, all and every such officer and persons so
refusing or neglecting shall forfeit and pay to the party ag
grieved the sum of five hundred dollars, and shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor.
39. Every person convicted of a misdemeanor under either of
the last four sections, shall be punished by a fine or imprison
ment, or both, at the discretion of the court in which he shall
be convicted; but such fine shall not exceed one thousand dol
lars, nor such imprisonment six months.
G.—MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
40. Whenever the supreme court, or any justice thereof, shall
have evidence from any judicial proceeding had before them,
that any person within this State is illegally confined and re
strained of his liberty, it shall be the duty of such court or jus
tice to issue a writ of habeas corpus for his relief, although no
petition be presented or application made for such writ.

318

HABEAS CORPUS.

41. 'Whenever it shall appear by satisfactory proof, that any
one is held in illegal confinement or custody, and that there is
good reason to believe that he will be carried out of the* State,
or suffer some irreparable injury, before he can be relieved by
the issuing of a habeas corpus, any justice of the supreme court
may issue a warrant under his hand and seal, reciting the facts
and directed to any sheriff, constable, or other person, and com
manding such officer or person to take such prisoner, and forth
with to bring him before such court or justice, to be dealt with
according to law.
42. When the proof mentioned in the last section shall also
be sufficient to justify an arrest of the person having such pris
oner in his custody, as for a criminal offence committed in the
taking or detaining of such prisoner, the warrant may also con
tain an order for the arrest of sucb person, for such offence.
43. Any officer or person to whom such warrant shall be
directed, shall execute the same, by bringing the prisoner therein
named, and the person who detains him, if so commanded by
the warrant, before the court or justice issuing the same; and
thereupon the person detaining such prisoner shall make a re
turn, in like manner, and the like proceeding shall be had as if
a writ of habeas corpus had been issued in the first instance.
44. If the person having such prisoner in his custody shall be
brought before such justice, as for a criminal offence, he shall be
examined, committed, bailed, or discharged in like manner as in
other criminal cases of the like nature.
45. If any person shall be committed to any prison, or in the
custody of any officer or person whatsoever, for any criminal or
supposed criminal matter, the said person shall not be removed
from the said prison or custody, into the custody of any other
officer or person, unless it be by habeas corpus, or some other
legal writ or process, or where the prisoner is delivered to the
constable or other inferior officer, or where any person is sent
by order of any court, or judge or justice of the peace, to any
common workhouse or house of correction, or where the pris
oner is removed from one prison or place to another within the
same county, in order to his trial, or discharge, in due course of
law, or in case of sudden fire or infection, or other necessity ;

HABEAS CORPUS.

319

and if any person shall, after such commitment aforesaid, make
out, or sign, or countersign any warrant for such removal, con
trary to this act, as well he who makes, or signs or counter
signs such warrant, as the officer or person who obeys or exe
cutes the same, shall, for every such offence, forfeit to the pris
oner or party grieved the sum of five hundred dollars, to be re
covered in the manner aforesaid.
46. And for preventing illegal imprisonment of citizens of this
State in prisons out of this State, no citizen of this State, who
now is, or hereafter shall be, an inhabitant of, or resident within
this State, shall or may be sent prisoner to any place whatsoever
out of this State, for any crime or offence committed within this
State, and every such imprisonment is hereby declared to be
illegal ; and if any of the said citizens now is, or hereafter shall
be, so imprisoned, such citizen so imprisoned shall and may, for
every such imprisonment, maintain by virtue of this act, an
action or actions of false imprisonment in any court of record
having cognizance of such actions, against the person or persons
by whom he shall be so committed, detained, imprisoned, sent
prisoner, or transported contrary to the true intent and meaning
of this act, and against all or any person or persons who shall
frame, contrive, write, seal, sign, or countersign any warrant or
writing for such commitment, detainer, imprisonment, or trans
portation, or shall be advising, aiding, or assisting in the same
or any of them ; and the plaintiff in every such action shall have
judgment to recover double costs, besides damages, which dam
ages, so to be given, shall not be less than fifteen hundred dollars ;
and the person or persons who shall knowingly frame, contrive,
write, seal, sign, or countersign any warrant for such commitment,
detainer, or transportation, or shall so commit, detain, imprison,
or transport any person or persons contrary to this act, or be
anywise advising, aiding, or assisting therein, being lawfully
convicted thereof, shall from thenceforth be disabled to bear any
office of trust or profit under this State, and shall be fined or
imprisoned at hard labor, or both, at the discretion of the court
before which the conviction shall be had ; provided, also, if any
citizen of this State, or person at any time resident in the same,
shall have committed any treason, felony, or misdemeanor in any

HABEAS CORPUS.

other of the United States, or in any foreign country, where he
ought to be tried for such offence, such citizen or person may be
sent to such State or foreign country having jurisdiction of such
offence, there to receive such trial, in the same manner as he
might have been sent before the making of this act.
47. No person shall be sued or impleaded for any offence
against this act, unless the party offending be sued or impleaded
for the same within two years at farthest after such time
wherein the offence shall be committed ; but if the party grieved
shall be in prison, by reason of such wrongful act, then within
the space of two years after the decease of such party while in
prison, or his deliverance out of prison, whichever shall happen
first.
48. If any information, suit, or action, shall be brought or ex
hibited against any person or persons for any offence committed
against this act, it shall be lawful for such defendant to plead
the general issue that they are not guilty, or that they owe
nothing, and to give the special matter in evidence; and if such
special matter, in case it were duly pleaded, had been good and
sufficient in law to discharge the said defendant or defendants
against the said information, suit, or action, the same, so given
in evidence, shall be as available to them, to all intents and
purposes, as if he or they had sufficiently pleaded, set forth, or
alleged the said matter, in bar or discharge of such information,
suit, or action.
49. And to the intent that no person may avoid his trial at
the sessions of oyer and terminer, or general jail delivery, by
procuring his removal at such time before the commencement
of the court, as he cannot be brought back to receive his trial
at the same court after the sessions of oyer and terminer, or
general jail delivery, shall be proclaimed for that county where
the prisoner is detained, such prisoner shall not be removed
from the common jail upon habeas corpus, granted in pursuance
of this act ; but, upon any such habeas corpus, shall be brought be
fore the justice or justices of the said court of oyer and terminer,
or general jail delivery, in open court, who shall thereupon do
what to justice appertains; provided, after the sessions of oyer

an indictment will lie, and in which no civil right is involved,
nor forfeiture or penalty given by law to any private person or
common informer, is prosecuted for, shall, from and after the
passing of this act, be exhibited or sustained in any court of
this State.
51. Nothing in this act shall extend to discharge out of prison
any person charged in debt, or other action, or on process in
any civil cause, unless by virtue of the proceeding herein for
that purpose specially provided ; and a discharge, under this act,
from imprisonment under a criminal charge, shall not have that
effect ; but the party so discharged shall be kept in custody ac
cording to law in such civil suit.
52. If any person shall be committed for treason, murder,
manslaughter, sodomy, rape, arson, burglary, robbery, forgery, or
larceny, or for rescues, or voluntary escapes in any such case, plainly
and specially expressed in the warrant of commitment, upon
his prayer or petition in open court, the first week of the term,
or first day of the sessions of oyer and terminer, or general jail
delivery, to be brought to his trial, shall not be indicted some
time in the next term, sessions of oyer and terminer, or general

of the term, session, or jail delivery, either by the prisoner or
any one in his behalf, to set at liberty such prisoner upon bail ;
unless it appear to the justices, upon oath or affirmation made,
that the witnesses against the prisoner could not be produced
the same term, sessions, or general jail delivery ; and if any
person committed as aforesaid, upon his prayer or petition in
open court, the first week of the term, or first day of the sessions
of oyer and terminer, or general jail delivery, to be brought to
his trial, shall not be indicted and tried the second term, ses

charged from his imprisonment.
II. -RIGHT OF APPEAL.
53. All proceedings commenced under this act before a jus'tice
of the supreme court, may be removed, after final decision by
such justice, by certiorari into the supreme court, that is to say,
if the imprisonment is for an alleged crime, and the decision is
against the right of the prisoner to a discharge, the prisoner
may remove such proceeding; if on civil process either party
may do so ; in like manner the final decision of the supreme
court thereon may be removed, by writ of error, into the court
of errors and appeals ; provided, however, that if a discharge has
been awarded, such appeal shall not stay such discharge.
54. The supreme court, and the court of errors and appeals in
the last resort, shall respectively have the power to make such
orders and to direct all such writs out of the supreme court, as
may be necessary, for the discharge or recommitment of such
prisoner, according to the judgment which shall be severally
given by said courts ; and generally to carry such judgment into
effect.

State, the same being acknowledged or proved before any judge
or justice of any supreme or superior court, or before any judge

the record of said judgment, as hereinbefore directed, in the
words following, or as nearly in conformity thereto as can be

in which said judgment shall have been obtained.
24. It shall be lawful for the attorney upon the record of said
judgment to authorize and empower the clerk of the court in
which said judgment was rendered to enter an acknowledgment
of satisfaction upon the record of said judgment by an instru
ment in writing' of the same general form and effect as that
mentioned and described in the last preceding section ; and when
such attorney upon the record shall have delivered to said clerk
a power of attorney, duly executed by him, and acknowledged
or proved, of the same tenor and effect as that mentioned in the
preceding section, the said clerk shall forthwith enter satisfac
tion of said judgment in pursuance thereof, and in conformity,
as nearly as may be, to the directions in cases wherein said
power of attorney may have been executed by the party in whose
favor the judgment was rendered, and the same fees shall be
charged for such services as in other cases.
25. The last preceding section shall apply to the satisfaction
of record of claims of mechanics' liens, if there be an attorney

of record of the same, and of any judgment entered thereon,
and also, to the satisfaction of decrees in the court of chancery
if there be a solicitor of the complainant of record.

as aforesaid, to enter satisfaction as aforesaid, the party so mak
ing satisfaction may, on due notice given, apply to the court to
have satisfaction entered as aforesaid, and the said court may

costs may be recovered by a writ of fieri facias or capias ad
satisfaciendum.

are dead, before satisfaction is entered on the record, the pre
ceding provisions and the like remedy shall apply as between
the survivor or survivors or the lawful representatives of any
deceased party, and a surviving party ; and the warrant to the
clerk mentioned in the twenty-third section of this act, and
other proceedings under the same, shall be in the same form, as
near as may be, as is required in the case of the original parties
to the suit.
29. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent
any party, making satisfaction as aforesaid, from proceeding,
according to the course of the respective courts, to enforce the
entering satisfaction on the record of judgments as heretofore,
nor to deprive any attorney at law from any lien which he may
have on any judgment for his costs.

without two days' notice to the defendant ; and there shall not
be two such rules existing in the same cause at the same time.

purpose, and put into a box ; and whenever for the trial of a
cause, civil or criminal, a jury shall be required, the said box
shall be shaken so as to intermix the said papers ; and thereupon
the sheriff or clerk, or some other person, by the direction of
the court, publicly and in open court, shall draw such papers
from the said box, one at a time, until twelve persons, whose
names are found written thereon, shall appear; and if any of
the twelve persons so appearing shall be successfully challenged
or be excused from serving on that jury, the said drawing shall
be continued until twelve persons not thus challenged or ex
cused shall appear; and such twelve being severally sworn or
affirmed, shall constitute a jury for the trial of the said cause;

trial of any cause, civil or criminal, a jury for the trial of such

certified by the judge as the list of jurors, in the same manner,
as near as may be, as is provided for the selection of a jury from
the general panel.

cause, and such view shall thereupon be had in such manner as
the court shall direct.

county in which process shall issue, and where the action being
founded upon contract express or implied, due proof is made on
oath or affirmation to the satisfaction of the justice, of the

court in making an order to hold to bail in pursuance of the

386

JUSTICES' COURTS.

fifty-eighth section of an act entitled " An act to regulate the
practice of courts of law."
II. Where the defendant is not a freeholder and resident of
the county in which such process shall issue, and where, the
action being founded upon tort, due proof is made on oath or
affirmation to the satisfaction of the justice, of the amount of
the damages claimed, and of such other facts and circumstances
as would, by the practice of the supreme court, warrant a jus
tice thereof in making an order to hold to bail in a case of tort.
III. If the defendant be a freeholder and resident of the
county in which such process shall issue, and due proof is made
on oath or affirmation to the satisfaction of such justice, that
the defendant has assigned or disposed of, or is about to assign
or dispose of, all his land lying in said county with intent to de

court of common pleas of the couuty in which such process is
sued, or to any supreme court commissioner, to set aside said
order, the defendant having first given reasonable notice to the
plaintiff of such application, and the giving bond or entering
into recognizance in manner hereinafter directed shall be no
waiver of the defendant's right to make such application ; and
if such justice of the supreme court, law judge or commissioner,
shall deem the proof made, insufficient to warrant an arrest, he
may order that the order made by the justice be set aside; such
order setting aside the justice's order shall thereupon operate as
a discontinuance of the suit in which such warrant issued ; the
bond or recognizance, if any, shall become void, and the plain

out of the increase or interest and not out of said principal ;
and whenever the particular estate or estates in such share of
said lands would have been determined and the same become
vested in fee simple absolute, if no such sale thereof had been
made, then the said principal shall be paid or such bond and mort

or tenants in common, some or any one of whom are unknown,
the others, or either one or more of thein, may commence a suit
by bill, for partition, in the court of chancery, in the same
manner as if all the owners of such real estate were known,
making such unknown owner or owners of said real estate a
party or parties thereto, by a publication according to the law
and practice of said court in case of absent defendants, under
the order (said order describing such real estate in such manner
and terms as will identify the same, by abuttals and boundaries
or otherwise, and naming the ancestor or other person last own

shall make such decree against said unknown owner or owners
as if they were known to the court, and as may be equitable
and just ; and shall have power to decree a partition of said real
estate among the owners thereof, in the same manner as if all
were known and by name had been made parties to said suit ; and
if the court shall be unable to determine the estates of such
unknown parties, then the chancellor shall make partition among
those owners whose estates can be ascertained, in such manner
as may in his judgment be equitable, and so that the owners of

508

PARTITION.

such ascertained estates shall hold their respective shares in
severalty ; and in case it shall appear to the chancellor that the.
said real estate is so circumstanced that such partition thereof
cannot he made without great prejudice to the interests of the
owners thereof, then the chancellor shall have power to decree
a sale of said real estate, and to direct the execution of a deed
or deeds therefor, to the purchaser or purchasers, which deed or
deeds shall convey all the right, title, and estate of all the owners
of said real estate, ascertained and unascertained, as completely

court, or a judge, at any time before the trial of the cause, to
order, upon such terms as they or he shall think proper, that

in the cause, on the part of the plaintiff', shall be amended in
conformity thereto, and the defendant shall plead de novo in
thirty days after service of a copy of the amended declaration.

of capias ad respondendum, shall be allowed, in lien of giving
bail to the sheriff, to deposit in the hands of the sheriff or other
officer making the arrest the sum indorsed on the writ by virtue
of the affidavit, to hold to bail, together with thirty dollars, to
answer for costs, and thereupon he shall be discharged from ar
rest ; and the sheriff or other officer shall, at the return of the
said writ, pay into court the money so deposited with him,
which shall remain in court subject to the order of the court ;
and in such case the defendant shall be permitted to appear to
the action without filing special bail, or his appearance may be
entered by the plaintiff without a waiver of his right to bail ;
provided, that the making of such deposit shall not prevent the
defendant making application to set aside the writ or order for
arrest, the same as may be done where bail is given to the
sheriff.
101. If the defendant, who shall have made a deposit in lieu
of bail to the sheriff as is provided for in the last section, shall,
at the return of the writ, duly put in and perfect bail to the
action according to the practice of the court, or if the writ or
order for arrest shall be set aside, the money so deposited and
paid into the court shall by order of the court be repaid to the
defendant ; but otherwise shall remain subject to the order of
the court, and if the plaintiff recover in the action sball be ap
plied in satisfaction in the whole or in part, as the case may be,
of the judgment recovered ; and if the plaintiff shall recover
for debt or damages, together with costs, a sum exceeding the
amount of such deposit, he shall be entitled to issue a writ of
capias ad satisfaciendum, and to collect thereon the balance re
maining due on the judgment ; but if the defendant recover
judgment in the action, the sum deposited and paid into court
shall be repaid to him.
102. Any defendant who may have given bail to the sheriff,

PRACTICE OF LAW.

619

or who shall have been surrendered by his bail before judgment
in the original action, may, in lieu of filing special bail or re
newing bail, make deposit into court of the sum for which bail
was ordered, together with thirty dollars, to answer for costs,
which moneys shall be held and applied as is mentioned in the
last preceding section.
G

PLEADING.

103. The plaintiff shall file his declaration against the defend
ant within thirty days after being returned summoned, or after
entering of special bail, and perfecting the same, or his being
returned in custody, or the entering of a committitur or waiver
of bail, or on failure thereof, shall become nonprossed, unless the
court, under special circumstances, shall grant the plaintiff
further time; and in such case, the plaintiff shall declare within
the time so granted, or become nonprossed.
104. The defendant shall file his plea within thirty days after
the expiration of the time limited or granted for filing the dec
laration, or on failure thereof, judgment shall be entered against
him, unless the court under special circumstances shall grant
the defendant further time ; and in such case the defendant
shall plead within the time so granted, or judgment be entered
against him.
105. If the plaintiff, after the defendant is in court, files his
declaration sooner than is required by law, and serves a copy
thereof on the defendant, he shall file his plea or demurrer in
thirty days after such service, or on failure thereof judgment
shall be entered against him ; provided, that there shall be in
dorsed on such copy served, a notice that unless the defendant
shall appear and file a plea or demurrer, within thirty days after
the date of such service, judgment will be entered against him,
and the plaintiff, before entering the judgment, shall file an
affidavit of such service.
106. The service of a copy of the declaration in the last pre
ceding section mentioned may be made by delivering the same
to the defendant personally, or by leaving it at his dwellinghouse or last place of abode ; and where the defendant is a cor

620

PRACTICE OF LAW.

poration, service may be made by delivering the same to the
president or other head officer, or to the secretary or clerk
thereof, personally, or by leaving the same at his dwelling-house
or place of abode ; and the plaintiff, if he shall be entitled to
costs in the cause, shall be allowed for such service the sum of
two dollars for each defendant so served, not exceeding three,
and the same to be included in the taxed bill of costs.
107. If further pleadings shall be necessary, they shall be filed
within thirty days, each after the other, or on failure thereof, the
like judgment as aforesaid shall be entered against the party so
failing, unless the court under special circumstances shall grant
further time as aforesaid.
108. If the plaintiff amend his declaration, the defendant shall
have twenty days to alter his plea or to plead anew ; and if the
defendant amend his plea the plaintiff shall have twenty days
to alter his replication or to reply anew ; and the like time shall
be allowed if any of the subsequent pleadings be amended ; but
all amendments shall be made on such equitable terms as the
court shall direct.
109. Parties shall take notice of the filing of the pleadings in
the cause, which shall have been filed within the time prescribed,
without service of a copy or notice of the filing thereof.
110. If an)' party shall not file his pleading in the cause within

so to do.
111. In cases where any declaration, plea, or other pleading

every cause shall be all filed together in the office of the clerk of
the court.
113. If any party would take advantage of the failure of the
adverse party in not filing his declaration, plea, or other plead

PRACTICE OF LAW.

621

ing, within the time prescribed by law, he shall take such ad
vantage at the term next after such failure, by moving the
court for the judgment to which he is thereupon by law enti
tled ; and if he fail so to do, it shall be considered as a waiver
of his right, and he shall not afterwards have such judgment,
unless he shall rule the party to plead ; which rule may be
granted by the court or by a judge in vacation.
114. The defendant in every action at law shall file with his
plea or demurrer an affidavit that the same is not intended for
the purpose of delay, and that the affiant verily believes that
the defendant hath a just and legal defence to said action on
the merits of the case, which affidavit shall be made by the
defendant, or in his absence may be made by his attorney or
agent in the action, and for want of such affidavit the plea or
demurrer shall be treated as a nullity ; provided, however, that
the court, or a judge, may give the defendant leave to plead or
demur without filing any affidavit therewith.
115. No dilatory plea, or plea of another judgment, shall be
received, unless the party offering such plea, do offer therewith
to be filed, an affidavit proving the truth thereof; or do show
some probable oause to the court to induce them to believe that
the matter therein set forth is true.
116. Where a defendant in an action of assumpsit pleads the
general issue alone, or in connection with other pleas, the plain
tiff shall be at liberty, by a demand in writing, to require a
specification of the defences intended to be made under such
plea of the general issue, and the defendant shall thereupon,
within twenty days after such demand, furnish the plaintiff's
attorney with a specification in writing of the defences intended
to be made under such plea ; and at the trial the defendant
shall, under such plea, be confined to the subject-matters of
defence contained in such specification ; and in case of the
neglect or refusal of the defendant to furnish such specification
within the time limited, he shall not be permitted under such
plea to give in evidence any defence except a denial of the mak
ing of the contract sued on ; provided, that where the ends of
justice require it, the court, or any judge thereof, may at, or at
any time before, the trial, and upon such terms as shall be

622

PRACTICE OF LAW.

equitable, permit the defendant to serve such specification when
the time above limited has expired, or to amend the specifica
tion which shall have been served.
117. The defendant in any action, except in cases of mutual
dealings, may plead the general issue, and give any special matter
in evidence, which, if pleaded, would be a bar to such action
upon giving notice, with such plea, of the matter so intended to
be given in evidence.
118 The plaintiff in replevin, and the defendant in every
other action, may plead, in any court of record, with leave of
the court, as many several matters as he shall think necessary
for his defence ; but if on demurrer any such matter be adjudged
to be insufficient, or if a verdict be found on any issue in such
action for the plaintiff, costs shall thereupon be awarded by the
court.
119. Where the defendant pleads the general issue, and gives
notice with it of special matter which he intends to give in evi
dence in bar of the action, the plaintiff shall, within thirty days
after filing such plea, or within such further time as he may be
granted by the court or a judge, file a written notice to the
defendant of any special matter which he intends to give in
evidence in denial or avoidance of such special matter so given
notice of by the defendant, and to which it would have been
necessary to reply specially had the defendant's defence been
specially pleaded, or else be precluded from giving the same in
evidence ; and such notice, both of plaintiff and defendant, shall
be copied as a part of the circuit record, and recorded with the
pleadings.
120. The plaintiff in any action may, by leave of the court, or
a judge, plead in answer to the plea or subsequent pleading of
the defendant as many several matters as he shall think neces
sary to sustain his action ; provided, that the costs of any issue
either in fact.or law shall follow the finding or judgment upon
such issue, and be adjudged to the successful party whatever
may be the result of the other issue or issues.
121. The defendant at any time before issue joined may move
the court to consolidate unnecessary actions, or to strike out
superfluous counts in the declaration.

PRACTICE OF LAW.

623

122. Whenever any pleading concludes to the country, issue
shall be considered as joined thereon, unless a demurrer be filed
thereto, and a similiter, when necessary, may be added at any
time.
123. If any writing, whereof a copy is annexed to the declara
tion, pica, or notice of set-off', or other notice, be referred to in
the body of the pleading as so annexed, the said copy shall cure
any defect by reason of not setting forth the same, or the in
sufficient setting forth of the same in the body of the declara
tion, plea, notice of set-off, or other notice ; and in all cases
where any copy of a writing signed by a party to the same shall
be so annexed and referred to, the same shall be recorded with
the pleadings, and form part of the record.
124. In actions of libel and slander the plaintiff shall be at
liberty to aver that the words or matter complained of were
used in a defamatory sense, specifying such defamatory sense,
without any prefatory averment to show how such words or
matter were used in that sense, and such averment shall be put
in issue by the denial of the alleged libel or slander ; and where
the words or matter set forth, with or without the alleged
meaning, show a cause of action, the declaration shall be
sufficient.
125. In actions upon bonds with a condition the plaintiff shall
state the condition and assign breaches thereof in his declara
tion ; and no evidence shall be given of any breach not so assigned.
126. The plaintiff or defendant in any action may aver per
formance of conditions precedent generally ; and the opposite
party shall not deny such averment generally, but shall specify
in his pleading the condition precedent, the performance of
which he intends to contest.
127. Express color and special traverses shall not be necessary
in any pleading.
128. A right by virtue of a private way may be pleaded
generally in the same manner as in pleading a public way.
129. In actions on contracts not under seal the defendant may
set up as a defence in abatement of the damages to be recovered
by the plaintiff, a defect in, or partial failure of, the considera
tion of the contract sued on, and may also recoup any damages

6'24

PRACTICE OF LAW.

which he may have sustained by reason of the non-performance
or defective performance of any part of the same contract by the
plaintiff; provided, that a notice of the particulars of such de
fence be annexed to the plea and filed therewith.
130. In actions on contracts made in another State it shall
not be lawful for a defendant to set up as a defence usury or
illegality in the consideration under the provisions of any statute
of such State, unless the defendant shall plead such statute
specially and annex to such plea a note of the time when the
same was passed.
131. Pleas puis darrein continuance shall be pleadable only
by permission of the court or a judge ; and the court or a judge,
in allowing any such plea, may direct that the pleading thereof
shall not be a waiver of former pleas.
132. The court or a judge in vacation shall have power, on
four days' notice, to strike out any pleading which is irregular
or defective, or is so framed as to prejudice, embarrass, or delay
a fair trial of the action, and the order striking out such pleading
shall be entered on the record, if required by the party against
whom the same is made, and error may be assigned thereon.
133. Any frivolous plea or demurrer, or sham plea, may be
struck out by the court or by a judge thereof, in term time or
vacation ; and upon an application to strike out any plea as a
sham plea, the court or judge may by an order direct the taking
of testimony, to be read on the hearing of a motion.
1M. A notice of set-off shall, with respect to the rights and
liabilities of the parties to the suit, be considered as a cross
action brought by the defendant ; the plaintiff may at the trial
make any defence to the subject-matter of the set-off, without
any counter notice which he would be entitled to make under
the general issue if the defendaut had brought an action for the
same ; but any defence which in an action would be required to
be specially pleaded, shall not be available to the plaintiff in an
swer to such set-off, unless he shall file a notice of such special
matter, as a pleading in the cause.

PRACTICE OF LAW.

625

II.—AMENDMENT AND VARIANCE.
135. Any pleading may be amended by the party, of course,
without application to the court, without costs, and without
prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before a
pleading in answer thereto has been filed ; and in such case a
copy of (he amended pleading shall be served on the adverse
party within five days after filing the same, who shall plead
thereto in thirty days after such service.
136. Ko variance between the allegation in a pleading and
the proof shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled
the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or
defence upon the merits; whenever it shall be alleged that a
party has been so misled, that fact shall be established to the
satisfaction of the court trying the cause, and thereupon the
court may order the pleading to be amended upon such terms as
shall be just.
137. When the variance is not established to be material, as
provided in the last section, the court may order an immediate
amendment of the pleading, without costs ; but where the alle
gation of the cause of action, or defence, to which the proof is
directed, is untrue, not in some particular or particulars only,
but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a
case of variance, but a failure of proof.
138. In order to prevent the failure of justice by reason of
mistakes and objections of form, it shall be lawful for the court,
or any judge thereof, at all times, to amend all defects and errors
in any proceeding in civil causes, whether there is anything in
writing to amend by or not, and whether the defect or error be
that of the party applying to amend or not, and all such amend
ments may be made with or without costs, and upon such terms
as to the court or judge may seem fit ; and all such amendments
as may be necessary for the purpose of determining in the exist
ing suit the real question in controversy between the parties
shall be so made.

626

PRACTICE OF LAW.

I.—DEMURRER.
139. No pleading shall be deemed insufficient for any defect
which could heretofore be objected to only by special demurrer;
and where issue is joined on a demurrer, the court shall give
judgment according as the very right of the cause and matter
in law shall appear, without regarding any imperfection, omis
sion, defect in, or lack of form; and no judgment shall be ar
rested, stayed, or reversed, for any such imperfection, omission,
defect in, or lack of form.
140. If the plaintiff or defendant shall not join in demurrer,
in thirty days after the filing thereof, such plaintiff shall be
nonprossed, and such defendant shall have judgment awarded
against him.
141. Where there are several issues in law and in fact, the
issue in law shall be first determined before the issue in fact
shall be tried.
142. Either party may give notice of the argument of a de
murrer, which notice shall be served at least ten days before the
time for hearing.
143. In actions in the circuit court, the demurrer may be
brought on for argument before the justice of the supreme
court, assigned to hold such circuit, either in term time or va
cation.
K.—JUDGMENT BY DEFAI LT AMD ASSESSMENT OF
DAMAGES.
144. The plaintiff, in any action of law, when the defendant
shall have omitted to file a plea or demurrer to the declaration,
or any subsequent pleading within the time required by law,
may enter as of course, either in term or vacation, in the min
utes of the court, such rule for judgment by default, either in
terlocutory or final, as he would by law have been entitled to if
such rule were applied for in open court, expressing in such rule
the true date of the actual entry thereof; and such rule, when
lawfully entered, shall have the same force and effect as if en
tered by order of the court, and if unlawfully entered shall be

PRACTICE OF LAW.

627

utterly void ; and for the purposes of this section, any frivolous
plea or demurrer, or sham plea, or plea irregularly pleaded,
may be treated and regarded as if the same had not been filed.
145. Any judge of the court, in which the action is pending,
may, upon application made before the entry of a rule for judg
ment by default, upon affidavit made by the defendant, or his
attorney in the suit, or agent in the matter in controversy, that
the defendant hath a defence to said action, which such affiant
believes to be just and legal, that he hath in good faith endeav
ored to prepare his plea, and setting forth a sufficient excuse
why he has not been able so to do, or upon affidavit made by
any person on behalf of the defendant, that he believes that the
defendant has a real defence to said action, and has been absent
from the State ever since the service of process, or upon affidavit
showing that the ends of justice require that further time be
given, grant, by order, under his hand, further time to plead,
not exceeding thirty days ; which order, if filed with the clerk
before the entry of judgment by default, shall during the time
therein granted stay the entry of such judgment, except upon
application in open court.
146. Where the declaration contains only common counts, or
common counts on which a recovery is sought, in addition to
any matter or thing mentioned in any special count, and the
plaintiff shall desire to file and serve his declaration, as is men
tioned in the one hundred and fifth section of this act, he shall
not take judgment at the end of the thirty days in said section
mentioned, unless he shall have annexed to his declaration, and
served therewith, a statement of the particulars of his demand
or of the amount for which judgment will be claimed.
147. If judgment by default be entered for want of a plea, it
shall be lawful for the court, or any judge thereof in term time
or vacation, on four days' notice, upon satisfactory proof that
such judgment was improvidently or fraudulently entered, or
that the defendant has a real defence to the action, to make an
order that such judgment be set aside or opened to let the de
fendant in to plead ; provided, that if such judgment shall have
been regularly obtained and without fraud, the order shall be
that the defendant be permitted to plead on such terms as may

628

PRACTICE OF LAW.

be equitable, and the lien acquired by such judgment and by the
execution thereon shall remain as security for the satisfaction of
any judgment the plaintiff may recover in the action.
148. Where a judgment shall be entered as for want of a plea,
on the ground that the plea or demurrer filed by the defendant
is frivolous, or that the plea is a sham plea, application may be
made to any judge of the court in which such judgment shall
be entered for the vacation of such judgment; and if it shall
appear that the judgment was illegally or improper!y entered,
it shall be lawful for such judge in term time or vacation, to
make an order that the same be vacated and set aside ; and upon
the making and filing of such order, such judgment shall be
come utterly void and of no effect, and the plaintiff shall be
compelled to pay the costs of such application.
149. Where interlocutory judgment in actions of assumpsit
shall be entered by default against the defendant, the plaintiff
may have his damages assessed by the court, or when the court
is not actually in session by any judge thereof or by the clerk,
unless a rule shall be entered for a writ of inquiry or assessment
of damages in open court.
150. In all actions ex-contractu, where the damages or sum
recoverable are a mere matter of calculation, or can readily be
ascertained, the same may be assessed or ascertained, on judg
ment by default, by the court or clerk as in actions of assumpsit.
151. The plaintiff may enter a rule for a writ of inquiry in
term time or vacation as of course ; but the defendant shall not
enter a rule that the damages shall be assessed by a writ of in
quiry in cases where the plaintiff is entitled to have his dam
ages assessed by the court, or a judge, or the clerk thereof,
unless he shall enter a rule therefor before the expiration of the
time for pleading, and shall, at the time of entering such rule,
file with the clerk of the court an affidavit, that the amount
claimed to be due to the plaintiff in the bill of particulars, or
some part thereof, is not due from the defendant to the plain
tiff, specifying what amount, if anything, is due to the plaintiff,
and that the rule for the assessment of damages by a writ of
inquiry is not intended for the purpose of delay, but only to have
the amount due to the plaintiff correctly ascertained ; which

PRACTICE OF LAW.

629

affidavit shall be made by the defendant, or in his absence by
his attorney or agent in such action ; and in case such affidavit
shall specify any sum to be due to the plaintiff, the plaintiff
shall be at liberty forthwith to enter final judgment therefor,
which shall operate as a waiver of the residue of his claim, as
set forth in his bill of particulars; provided, nevertheless, that the
court, or a judge thereof, may upon application by the defend
ant before final judgment is entered, order that the damages be
assessed in open court.
152. The same notice shall be given of executing writs of in
quiry and of countermand as is required for the trial of issues
in fact.
158. If the plaintiff shall not proceed to execute the writ of
inquiry according to notice, or countermand such notice in due
time, the defendant shall be entitled to costs.
154. Where the damages are assessed by a writ of inquiry,
no rule for final judgment shall be entered, except by order of
the court, or a judge thereof, on two days' notice to the defend
ant or his attorney ; but where the damages are assessed by the
court, or a judge, or the clerk, a rule for final judgment may
be entered upon filing such assessment, as of course, which judg
ment shall be signed and take effect as of the day when such
rule is actually entered.

L.—DISCOVERY BEFORE TRIAL.
L — Upon Interrogatories.
155. After an action at law is at issue, either party may serve
upon the opposite party written interrogatories upon any matter
material to the issue, and the same shall be answered in writing,
under oath, and the answer served upon the party proposing the
interrogatories, in fifteen days after their service, and the an
swer shall be strictly responsive to the interrogatories proposed ;
and the court may, by an attachment for contempt or otherwise,
compel an answer thereto ; and such answer shall be evidence
in the action, if offered as such by the parties proposing the in
terrogatories, but not otherwise ; provided, however, that the

630

PRACTICE OF LAW.

court, or a judge out of court, may, upon good cause shown,
and upon two days' notice to the other party, order any of said
interrogatories to be stricken out, or amended, or new ones to
be added, or give further time for answering the same, or order
the answer to be amended.
II.— Admission of Execution of Papers.
156. Either party may, by written notice, served at least fif
teen days before the trial, call ou the other party to admit, in
writing, the execution of any document, saving all just excep
tions ; and in case of refusal or neglect to admit for ten days
after such service, the costs of proving the document shall be
paid by the party so refusing or neglecting, whatever the result
of the cause may be, unless at the trial the judge shall certify
that the refusal or neglect to admit was reasonable ; and an affi
davit of the attorney in the cause of the due signature of any
admissions made in pursuance of such notice, and annexed to
the affidavit, shail be in all cases sufficient evidence of such ad
mission.
III.—Inspection of Books, etc.
157. The court, other than the court for the trial of small
causes, before which a civil action or proceeding, whether of a
legal or equitable nature, is pending, or a judge thereof, in term
time or vacation, may, in their discretion, and upon five days'
notice of the application, order either party to give to the other,
within a specified time, and under such terms as may be imposed,
an inspection and copy, or permission to take a copy, of any
books, papers, or documents in his possession or under his con
trol, containing evidence relating to the merits of the action or
proceeding, or of the defence thereto, and if compliance with
the order be refused, and such books, papers, or documents shall
not be given in evidence in such action or proceeding, the court
may punish the party so refusing as for a contempt of the court.
158. Any application, in pursuance of the next preceding sec
tion, shall be by petition, stating the grounds of such applica
tion, and verified by the oath of the party, or of his attorney,

PRACTICE OF LAW.

631

solicitor, or agent in the matter ; and the affidavit of the oppo
site party, or of his attorney, solicitor, or agent in the matter,
maybe read in opposition to such application, without notice of
the taking of such affidavit, or either party, or any other wit
ness, may, on such application, be examined in relation thereto.

159. Any party to an action in the supreme or circuit court
may be examined as a witness at the instance of any adverse
party or parties, or of any one of the several adverse parties,
after issue joined in said action and before the trial of said
action ; said examination may be before any justice of the su
preme court, or before any supreme court commissioner, on a
previous notice to the party to be examined of at least five
days, unless a shorter time is, for good cause shown, prescribed
by a justice of the supreme court ; the party shall only be exam
ined upon an order made by a justice of the supreme court to
whom application therefor is made, and the granting of said
order shall be discretionary with the justice to whom such ap
plication is made ; the service of said order shall be sufficient
summons and notice to the party or parties named therein to
attend before said justice or supreme court commissioner therein
named.
160. Iso party to be examined who shall reside in the State
of New Jersey, shall be compelled to attend in any other county
than that where he resides, but any party residing out of this

dent plaintiff may be served out of this State, with personal
notice to attend such examination, and if he does not appear, in
compliance with said notice, all proceedings shall be stayed on
his part until his appearance, of which appearance he shall give
the same notice to the defendant as required by the next pre
ceding section of this act.
161. Any party to be examined, named in said order of said
justice of the supreme court, may be compelled to attend before
the justice of the supreme court or supreme court commissioner,

632

PRACTICE OF LAW.

named in said order, in the same manner as any witness may be
compelled to attend upon the trial of a civil action where he has
been duly subpoenaed to attend.
162. The said examination of said party or parties shall be
taken by said justice or commissioner orally, the same as on the
trial of a cause, with the risdit of examination and cross-examination ; and said examination shall be reduced to writing, and
shall be signed by the party or parties so examined as aforesaid,
and certified by said justice or commissioner, and filed with the
clerk of the county where the cause is to be tried ; and said ex
amination may be read by cither party at the trial ; where the
examination is made before a justice of the supreme court, he
may authorize the same to be reduced to writing, by any clerk
of any circuit court, or by any attorney or counsellor of said
court ; any question may be objected to, and the answer taken
subject to the objection, or if the party refuse to answer, any
justice of the supreme court shall compel the party to answer
the same, if the party examining is legally entitled to have the
same answered.
163. The examination of the party thus taken shall not be
conclusive on the opposite party, but may be rebutted at the
trial by adverse testimony.
164. If a party refuse to attend and testify as hereinabove
provided, he may be punished as for a contempt, and all or any
of the pleadings in the case upon his part, stricken out by order
of any justice of the supreme court in his discretion.
165. The party examined shall receive the same fees as if
subpoenaed and attending as a witness on the trial of a cause,
and the justice or commissioner taking the testimony shall re
ceive the same fees for his services as are now allowed by law
to a master in chancery for taking testimony in a cause.
166. The party examining shall in the first instance pay the
witness fees and all the costs and expenses of said examination,

cause where a writ of error lies to a higher court, shall allege
an exception, praying that the court will allow it, if he who
alleged the exception instantly writes the same, and requires
that the judge or judges of the said court shall put thereto his
or their seal or seals in testimony thereof, such judge or judges,
or the greater part of them present, shall so do ; and if such
higher court, upon the cause being removed before them, do not

stated and agreed to in writing by the parties or their attorneys ;
or, if the parties or their attorneys cannot agree upon the bill of
exceptions that were in fact taken, though not sealed, the same

applies for a rule to show cause why a new trial should not be
granted, the granting thereof shall be a waiver of all bills of
exceptions, except on points expressly reserved in said rule ; a

in the discretion of the court, be special, and then the case shall
be heard and decided on the grounds upon which the rule was
allowed.

premises claimed in the declaration, upon which a writ of pos
session may issue.
12. The plea shall be according to one of the forms of pleas
contained in said schedule, as the circumstances of the case may
require, or to the like effect, and, under such plea, the defendant

PRACTICE OF LAW.

663

may give in evidence an)' lawful defence to the action, not in
consistent with the other provisions of this act.
13. The plea of the defendant shall, for the purposes of that
action, be an admission that he was in possession of the premises
for which he defends, or that he claimed title thereto, at the
time of commencing the action.
14. The defendants named in the summons may plead to and
defend the action, either jointly or separately.
15. The defendants, or either of them, may defend for a part
only of the premises, and when for a part, it shall be described
in the plea with the same certainty as is required in the sum
mons.
16. If the premises be not described with sufficient certainty
in the declaration or plea, the court or a judge may order it to
be amended so as to be so described, and if either party fail to
comply with such order, judgment may be entered as for want
of a declaration or plea, according to the circumstances of the
case.
17. The landlord of a tenant in possession, or other proper
person, may by leave of the court or a judge, be admitted to
appear and defend the action, in all cases where the same would
have been allowed heretofore ; provided, the application therefor
be made in twenty days after the return day of the summons,
or within such further time as may be granted by the court or
a judge, and five days' notice of such application, and of the
taking of affidavits to be used thereon, be given to the plaintiff;
and the landlord or other person admitted under this section to
defend, in respect of property whereof he is in possession only
by the tenant, shall state, in his plea, that he defends as land
lord, and shall be at liberty to set up such defence as a land
lord has heretofore been allowed to set up, and no other.
18. If the landlord or any other person than the defendant
named in the summons be admitted to defend the action, the
plaintiff shall declare against him and the defendant named in
the summons, and he may join with the tenant in possession in
the defence, or they may defend separately.
19. If a plea be filed limiting the defence to a part only of
the premises, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment that

664

PRACTICE OF LAW.

be recover possession of the part not defended for, upon which
a writ of possession may issue ; and where a part only of the
premises are defended for, the plaintiff may enter a discontinu
ance of the action as to that part, and enter judgment for the
residue, without thereby becoming liable to pay costs to the de
fendants, or any of them.
20. The plaintiff may, at any time, discontinue the action, as
to any or all of the defendants, upon payment of his or their
costs.
21. If one of several plaintiffs desires to discontinue, he may
apply to the court or a judge to have his name struck out of
the proceedings, which may be ordered upon such terms as the
court or judge may think just, and the action shall thereupon
proceed at the suit of the other plaintiff.
22. Any person made a defendant, who is not in actual pos
session of the premises at the commencement of the action, may
appear at any time before the time for pleading has expired, and
disclaim all right or title in or to the premises, and thereupon
such disclaimer, if allowed by the court or a judge, shall be en
tered on the record, and the defendant shall have judgment that
he recover his costs of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff shall as
against such defendant be entitled to a judgment forthwith that
he recover possession of the premises.
23. If one of several defendants, who defends separately for a
portion of the property, retracts his plea, and confesses the plain
tiffs action as to such portion, the plaintiff may forthwith enter
judgment, and issue execution for the recovery of the possession
of that portion, and for the costs occasioned by the defence re
lating to the same, and the action may proceed as to the resi
due; provided, that if any other defendant defends for the same
portion, then the plaintiff shall not be at liberty to issue execu
tion for the recovery of the possession of that portion until he
has recovered a judgment against all the defendants who de
fended therefor.
I.—By and against Joint Tenants.
24. If the action be brought by one of several joint tenants
or tenants in common or coparceners, any co-tenant or copar

PRACTICE OF LAW.

665

cener defending the action may give notice with his plea, that
he defends as such and admits the right of the plaintiff to an
undivided share of the property (stating what share), but de
nies an actual ouster of him from the property, which notice
shall be copied as a part of the circuit record, and recorded with
the pleadings; and upon the trial of such issue, the additional
question of whether an actual ouster has taken place shall be
tried; and if, upon the trial of the issue, it be proved that the
defendant is such joint tenant, tenant in common, or coparcener,
with the plaintiff, and no such actual ouster shall be proved,
then the plaintiff shall be nonsuited, with costs; but if it shall
be proved either that the defendant is not such joint tenant,
tenant in common, or coparcener, or that an actual ouster has
taken place, then the jury shall so find by their verdict, and the
plaintiff shall have judgment, in accordance with the verdict,
for the recovery of possession and costs.
II. —Bill of Particulars.
25. After issue joined in ejectment, either party may demand
in writing of the other a bill of particulars of his claim or title
to the premises in question ; and such bill of particulars shall be
delivered in twenty days after the same shall be demanded, or
within such further time as the court or a judge on good cause
shown may grant, and in default thereof no evidence of such
title shall be given on the trial.
26. The bill of particulars shall include an abstract of such
documentary evidence of title as the party may intend to give
in evidence on the trial ; and if any such documents may by law
be recorded, it shall also state where they are recorded, or if not
recorded, then it shall include copies of such thereof as are in
the possession of the party, with the name or names of the sub
scribing witness or witnesses, if any.
27. The court or a judge may, upon good cause shown, allow
either party to serve an amended bill of particulars ; but in all
cases the evidence of title shall at the trial be confined to the
matters contained in the bill of particulars.

666

PRACTICE OF LAW.
III.—Death of Parties.

28. The death of a plaintiff or defendant in ejectment shall
not cause the action to abate, but it may be continued as here
inafter provided.
29. In case the right of the deceased plaintiff shall survive to
another plaintiff, a suggestion may be made of the death, which
suggestion shall not be traversable, but be subject to be set aside
if untrue, and the action may proceed at the suit of the surviv
ing plaintiff; and if such suggestion be made before the trial,
then the plaintiff shall have a verdict, and recover such judg
ment as aforesaid, upon its appearing that he was entitled to
bring the action, either separately or jointly with the deceased
plaintiff; and in case of the death before trial of one of several
plaintiffs, whose right does not survive to any other of the
plaintiffs, if the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff
shall not become a party to the action, in the manner herein
after provided, a suggestion may be made of the death, which
shall not be traversable, but be subject to be set aside if untrue,
and the action may proceed at the suit of the surviving plaintiff,
for such share of the property as he is entitled to, and costs.
30. In case of a verdict for two or more plaintiffs, if one of
such plaintiffs die before execution executed by delivery of pos
session thereupon, the other plaintiff may, whether the legal
fight to the property shall survive or not, suggest the death in
manner aforesaid, and proceed to judgment and execution for
recovery of the possession of the whole of the premises in ques
tion to which the right of possession may be found by the ver
dict ; but nothing herein contained shall affect the right of the
legal representative of the deceased plaintiff, or the liability of
the surviving plaintiff to such representative; and the entry and
possession of such surviving plaintiff, under such execution, shall
be considered as an entry and possession on behalf of such rep
resentative, in respect of the share of the premises in question to
which he shall be entitled as such representative, and the court
may direct possession to be delivered accordingly.
31. In case of the death before trial of a sole plaintiff, or of
one of several plaintiffs whose right does not survive to any

PRACTICE OF LAW.

667

other plaintiff, the legal representative of such deceased plaintiff
may, by leave of the court, enter a suggestion of such death, and
that he is such legal representative, and the action shall there
upon proceed ; and the truth of such suggestion shall be tried on
the trial of the action, together with the title of the deceased
plaintiff; and such judgment shall follow upon the verdict in
favor of or against the person making such suggestion, as is
hereinbefore provided with reference to a judgment for or against
such deceased plaintiff.
82. In case a sole plaintiff die after a verdict in his favor, and
before execution executed by delivery of possession thereon,
judgment shall nevertheless be entered in his favor, and have
the same effect as if entered in his lifetime; and the court, upon
suggestion of such death, and application of the legal represen
tative of the deceased plaintiff, may order that a writ issue for
the delivery to such representative of the possession of the
premises recovered, and the same shall be delivered accordingly,
subject, however, to such terms as the court may impose ; and
the personal representatives of such deceased plaintiff shall have
like remedies for the collection of the costs recovered by such
judgment as they would have upon any other judgment for
money in favor of said deceased.
33. If, after a verdict in favor of a defendant, a sole plaintiff,
or one of several plaintiffs, die before judgment, the defendant
shall nevertheless be entitled to judgment as if no such death
had happened ; and in case of a sole plaintiff, the defendant
may proceed for the recovery of his costs, in like manner as
upon any other judgment for money, against such deceased ; and
in case of several plaintiffs, the defendant may have execution
against the surviving plaintiff for his costs ; and if, after such
verdict in favor of a defendant, and before judgment, he shall
die, judgment shall nevertheless be entered in his favor, and
have the same effect as if entered in his lifetime.
34. In case of the death before judgment of one of several de
fendants who defends jointly, a suggestion may be made of the
death, which suggestion shall not be traversable, but be subject
to be set aside if untrue, and the action may proceed against
the surviving defendant to judgment and execution ; but if such

608

PRACTICE OF LAW.

death happen before trial, the court, in its discretion, may order
that notice be given to the legal representative of such deceased
defendant to appear and defend the action within a time to be
limited by the court, the notice to be served in such manner as
the court may direct ; and in case such representative appear
and plead he shall plead the same plea, and the same proceed
ings may be taken against him as if he had been originally ad
mitted to defend the action ; and if no such order be made, or
if one be made, and such representative do not appear and plead
within the time so limited, and an affidavit be filed of the due
service of such notice, then the plaintiff suggesting the death,
in manner aforesaid, may proceed against the surviving defend
ant to judgment and execution.
35. In case of the death of a sole defendant, or of all the de
fendants, before trial, a suggestion may be made of the death,
which suggestion shall not be traversable, but be subject to be
set aside if untrue, and the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judg
ment for recovery of the possession of the premises in question,
unless some other person shall appear and defend within the
time to be appointed for that purpose by the order of the court,
to be made on the application of the plaintiff; and the court,
upon such application, may order that the plaintiff shall be at
liberty to sign judgment within such time as the court may
think. fit, unless the legal representative of the deceased defend
ant or defendants shall, within such time, appear and plead to
the action ; and such order may be served in such manner as the
court under the circumstances may direct; and in case such
person shall appear and plead, he shall plead the same plea, and
the same proceedings may be taken against him as if he had
been originally admitted to defend the action ; and if no plea
be filed within the time limited, then the plaintiff, upon filing
an affidavit of the due service of such order, shall be at liberty
to sign judgment pursuant thereto.
36. In case of the death of a sole defendant, or of all the de
fendants, after verdict against him or them, the plaintiff shall
nevertheless be entitled to judgment as if no such death had
taken place, and to proceed by execution for the recovery of pos
session without suggestion or revivor, and to proceed for the

PRACTICE OF LAW.

669

recovery of the costs in like manner as upon any judgment for
money against such defendant or defendants.
37. In case of the death of one of several defendants, who
defends separately for a portion of the premises in question, for
which no other defendant defends, before trial, or after a verdict
against him, the same proceedings may be taken as to such por
tion as in case of the death of a sole defendant, or the plaintiff
may proceed against the surviving defendant in respect of the
portion of the premises in question for which he defends.
38. In case of the death before trial of one of the several de
fendants who defends separately in respect of property for which
a surviving defendant also defends, the court, at any time before
the trial, may order that notice be given to the legal represen
tative of such deceased defendant to appear and defend the ac
tion within a time to be limited by the court, the notice to be
served in such manner as the court may under the circumstances
direct ; and in case such representative appear and plead, he
shall plead the same plea and the same proceedings may be taken
against him, as if he had been originally admitted to defend the
action ; and if no such order be made, or if one be made and
such representative do not appear and plead within the time so
limited, and an affidavit be filed of the due service of such no
tice, then the plaintiff suggesting the death, in manner aforesaid,
may proceed against the surviving defendant to judgment and
execution.
•
39. If, after verdict, a new trial be granted, then, for the pur
pose of preventing an abatement of the action, the same pro
ceedings may be had as if there had been no trial.
C—TRIAL AND JUDGMENT.
40. After issue is joined, the parties shall proceed to the trial
as in other actions.
If the plaintiff appears at the trial, and the defendant does
not, the jury shall render a verdict of guilty against the de
fendant, without any proof of title by the plaintiff.
If the defendant appears, and the plaintiff does not, the plain
tiff shall be nonsuited.

670

PRACTICE OF LAW.

If both parties appear, the question at the trial shall be (ex
cept as hereinafter provided), whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs,
or either, and which of them, is entitled to recover the posses
sion of the premises, and whether of the whole or of part, and
if of part, then of which part.
41. If a verdict be found for the plaintiff or plaintiffs, or either
of them, for the whole or a part, the jury shall, by the verdict,
particularly specify such part, and judgment shall be entered
thereon, that he or they recover the possession of the same,
either in whole or in part, as the case may be, with costs, upon
which a writ of possession may issue.
42. Provided, that if it shall appear at the trial, that the
plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the premises or any part
thereof, but that the title thereto (other than the mere posses
sory right), is in some one of the defendants who, as landlord,
remainderman, reversioner, or otherwise, has been made a defend
ant by the plaintiff, the verdict shall be, that the plaintiff recover
possession thereof, and that the title (other than such possessory
right), is in the defendants or some one of them, as the same
shall be specially found ; and judgment shall be entered thereon
in pursuance of such verdict, and a writ of possession shall there
upon be issued accordingly.
43. If at a trial the title of the plaintiff shall appear to have
existed as alleged in the declaration in such manner that the
plaintiff or plaintiffs, or one of them, was, at the commence
ment of the action, entitled to recover possession of the prem
ises in question, or of some part thereof, but shall also appear to
have expired at the time of the trial- the plaintiff or plaintiffs
so entitled shall, notwithstanding such expiration, be entitled to
a verdict, according to the fact, that he was so entitled at the
commencement of the action, and to a judgment accordingly,
with his costs of suit ; and as to the premises claimed, the judg
ment shall be, that the defendant go thereof without day.
44. A judgment in an action of ejectment, commenced after
this act takes effect, shall be conclusive, as to the right of pos
session, and the title to the premises (as the case may be), as the
same has been established by such judgment, upon the party
against whom it is recovered, and upon all persons claiming

PRACTICE OF LAW.

671

from, through, or under such party, by title arising after the
commencement of' such action ; provided, that if any person
against whom such judgment is recovered shall be, at the time
of its recovery, an infant, idiot, or lunatic, the judgment shall be
no bar to an action commenced by such person, or any one claim
ing from, through, or under such person, within three years
after the removal of such disability.

D.—MESNE PROFITS AND COSTS.
45. After a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, an action may
be brought for the mesne profits and damages in all cases where
the defendant in ejectment would be liable for mesne profits and
damages, as heretofore, or the plaintiff may declare for and re
cover the same in the same action, under such regulations as to
the pleadings and proceedings as the justices of the supreme
court may prescribe, which regulations shall be applicable to
actions of ejectment in the circuit court, as well as in the su
preme court.
46. The action for the recovery of mesne profits shall be
brought in the name of the plaintiff in the action of ejectment,
or of his personal representatives if he shall have died after
judgment recovered.
47. In the action for mesne profits, the plaintiff shall be en
titled to recover of the defendant as damages the full value of
the use and occupation of the premises for the time such defend
ant was in possession thereof, not exceeding six years before the
commencement of such action ; but such damages shall not in
clude the value of the use of any improvements made by the de
fendant ; and where permanent improvements have been made
in good faith on the premises by the defendant, or those under
whom he claims, while holding adversely to the plaintiff under
color of title obtained by a fair bona fide purchase from some
person in possession, and supposed to have a legal right and title
thereto, the value of such permanent improvements shall be
allowed to the defendant, and set off* against the damages of the
plaintiff to the extent of such damages and no further.
48. In ejectment, the successful party shall in all cases, except

672

PRACTICE OF LAW.

where it is otherwise provided in this act, recover his costs of
the other party, and may have like executions therefor, as in
personal actions ex delicto.
49. If upon the issue joined, the plaintiff shall recover a ver
dict either for the whole or a part of the premises in dispute, he
shall recover costs, and may include in the writ of possession
an execution for the costs, or may issue a separate execution
therefor.
50. If the plaintiff shall obtain judgment by default for want
of a plea, he shall also recover his costs by the same judgment,
and have execution therefor, including the costs on the writ of
possession, against the defendant named in the summons, which
execution for costs may be included in the writ of possession ;
provided, it appear by the affidavit of service of the summons
that the defendant was in actual possession of the premises
claimed, or some part thereof, at the time of such service, and
that the same was served personally upon him, or upon some
member of his family above the age of fourteen years, at his
dwelling-house or place of abode ; and if it do not so appear, then
the plaintiff may recover his costs in an action for mesne profits
against the defendant named in the summons, as heretofore.
51. If by the plea filed, the defence is limited to part only of
the premises claimed, and the plaintiff takes judgment of the
part undefended for, and enters a discontinuance as to the resi
due, the costs of the plaintiff in the ejectment shall only be re
coverable in an action for mesne profits, as heretofore.

E.—MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
52. Error may be brought in like manner as in other actions
upon any judgment in ejectment.
53. Wherever in this act, the words "legal representative"
of a deceased party, plaintiff or defendant, occur in relation to
the effect of the death of such party, they shall be under
stood to mean such heir, devisee, or other representative of the
deceased person, as upon his death become seized or possessed
of, or otherwise entitled to, the estate or interest in the premises

PRACTICE OF LAW.

673

in question of which he was seized, possessed, or entitled unto
at the time of his death.
54. The several courts in which actions of ejectment may be
pending, may exercise over the proceedings therein, the like
jurisdiction and control as heretofore exercised in the action of
ejectment, so as to insure a trial of the title only, and of actual
ouster when necessary, and for all other purposes for which such
jurisdiction may at present be exercised, and may make such
regulations concerning the said actions as may be necessary more
fully to carry into effect the intention of this act ; and the pro
visions of all statutes not inconsistent with the provisions of this
act, and which may be applied to the altered mode of proceed
ing, shall remain in force and be applied thereto ; provided, that
nothing in this section contained shall authorize the said courts
to exercise any control or jurisdiction, or make any regulations
inconsistent with the true intent and meaning of this act.

AN ACT TO REGULATE THE ACTION OF REPLEVIN.
A.—WHEN ACTION LIES.
1. Be it enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the
State of New Jersey, That if the goods or chattels of any person
be taken and wrongfully detained, the sheriff, by a writ of re
plevin, shall cause the same goods or chattels to be replevied
and delivered, and shall summon the person who took them, to
appear at the return of the said writ, and answer the plaintiff
of the taking and unjust detention of the same.

PRACTICE OF LAW.

677

2. Any unlawful detention of goods and chattels from their
lawful owner, or the person entitled by law to the possession of
the same, shall be deemed an unlawful taking for the purpose
of supporting an action of replevin.
3. No replevin shall lie in case of distress for any tax, assess
ment, or fine, to be collected or levied in- pursuance of any law
of this State ; and if any person or persons shall hereafter sue
out or prosecute a replevin in any such case, he or they shall
forfeit oue hundred and fifty dollars, to be recovered, with costs
of prosecution, by any person who shall sue for the same, by
action of debt, in any court of record having cognizance there
of ; the one moiety of the said forfeiture to the person who shall
sue for the same, and the other moiety to the State.
B.-WRIT OF, HOW EXECUTED.
4. All writs of replevin shall issue out of the supreme court,
or out of the circuit court, or court of common pleas of the
county where the property was taken or is detained, and the
said writs shall be made returnable to the court out of which
they were issued ; and may be made returnable in term time or
in vacation ; and the summons therein shall be served and re
turned in the manner prescribed for the service and return of
writs of summons in personal actions, in case such service can
be made ; but if the summons cannot be served in manner afore
said by reason of the* absence of the defendant and his non-resi
dence within the county in which the goods or chattels are re
plevied, then the same shall be served as the court or a judge
may by an order direct.
5. 'W rits of replevin may be directed to and executed by the
coroners of any county, in all cases in which by law writs in
other actions may be directed to and executed by such coroners;
and all such writs of replevin may be executed and returned by
any one of such coroners in the same manner in all respects as
sheriffs are by law authorized or directed to execute and return
the same ; and all bonds required by law to be taken in such
cases shall be made to the coroner executing such writs by his
name of office.

678

PRACTICE OF LA.W.

6. Every sheriff or coroner, before he makes deliverance of
any goods or chattels, by virtue of any writ of replevin, shall
take in his own name, from the plaintiff and two responsible
persons as sureties, a bond in double the value of the goods and
chattels mentioned in the writ (such value to be ascertained by
the oath or affirmation of one or more disinterested witnesses,
which oath or affirmation such sheriff or coroner is hereby au
thorized and required to administer), and conditioned for prose
cuting the suit with effect and without delay, and for duly re
turning the said goods and chattels in case a return shall be
awarded ; and if any sheriff or coroner shall take security other
wise, or neglect to take sufficient security, he shall answer for
the value of the goods and chattels.
7. The sheriff or coroner taking bond as is mentioned in the
preceding section shall, at the request and costs of the defend
ant, assign the same to the defendant, under his hand and
seal ; and if the bond so taken and assigned be forfeited, the de
fendant may, in his own name, bring an action and recover
thereon; and the court, wherein such action shall be- brought
may, by rule of the court, give such relief to the parties upon
such bond as shall be agreeable to justice ; and such rule shall
have the nature and effect of a defeasance to such bonds.
8. No coroner shall execute a writ of replevin until the re
plevin bond and the sufficiency of the sureties shall be approved
by one of the judges of the court out of which the writ shall
issue, or a supreme court commissioner of this State, which ap
proval shall be indorsed on the bond, and thereupon the coroner
may proceed to serve the writ according to law.
Before the commissioner shall indorse his approval on such
bond, he shall require the sureties named therein to justify
before him in the usual form, and shall immediately file the affi
davits of justification with the clerk of the court whence the
writ of replevin issued.
9. The sheriff or coroner to whom any writ of replevin shall
be delivered, shall take the goods and chattels whereof deliver
ance is sought, into his own custody and possession, notwith
standing any claim of property therein by the defendant, and
shall proceed to make deliverance thereof to the plaintiff in the

PRACTICE OF LAW.

said writ named, unless the said defendant shall, within twentyfour hours after service of the writ of replevin upon him in the
manner hereinbefore prescribed, deliver to such sheriff or cor
oner a written claim of property, specifying the goods and chat
tels so claimed, and shall also, within the time aforesaid, deliver
to such sheriff or coroner a bond, with one or more sufficient
sureties, being freeholders and residents in the county, and in
double the value of the goods and chattels so claimed, with con
dition to deliver the said goods and chattels in as good condition
as the same were at the time of making such claim, to the
plaintiff or his lawful representatives, if the same shall be ad
judged to the plaintiff; which bond the said sheriff or coroner
is hereby required, at the request and costs of the plaintiff or
his lawful representatives, to assign to such plaintiff or his law
ful representatives, who are hereby authorized, if the said bond
shall be forfeited, to bring an action, and recover thereon, in his
or their own name.
10. In case the property replevied shall be delivered by the
sheriff or coroner to the defendant, on his presenting a written
claim of property and giving bond as above provided, the sheriff
or coroner shall make return of the facts to the court, and shall
annex the said claim of property to the said writ, and return
the same therewith ; and the said suit shall be proceeded in and
determined in the same manner, in all respects, as if such claim
of property had not been made ; and, if the plaintiff recover,
the jury impanelled to try the issues or to ascertain the dam
ages, shall find the value of the gooils and chattels as well as
the damages of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff shall have judg
ment thereon in damages as well for the value of the goods and
chattels, as for taking and detaining them ; and upon such judg
ment, t he plaintiff (in addition to his remedy on the bond), may
have execution against the defendant in replevin by writ of
capias ad satisfaciendum or fieri facias.
11. If any sheriff* or coroner to whom any writ of replevin
shall be delivered, either by himself or his deputy or bail iff, shall
make deliverance to the plaintiff of the goods and chattels men
tioned in such writ, or of any part thereof, before he shall have
served a copy of the said writ upou the defendant as aforesaid,

680

PRACTICE OF LAW.

or within twenty-four hours after such service, or shall omit or
refuse, upon the tender of such claim of property and bond as
are hereinbefore mentioned, to restore the goods and chattels so
claimed to the defendant, such sheriff or coroner shall be an
swerable to such defendant for all damages he shall sustain
therefrom.,
12. If any person shall take the goods and chattels of another,
and put them into any stable, building, house, or place of
strength, and the persou from whom the same goods or chattels
shall be taken, sues for a replevin thereof, the sheriff or coroner
shall solemnly demand deliverance thereof at the stable, build
ing, house, or place where the same are detained ; and if neither
the taker nor any person on behalf of such taker, shall upon
demand, deliver the same, or if no person shall come upon such
demand to deliver the same, the sheriff or coroner shall take the
power of his county and break open such stable, building, house,
or place of strength, and make replevin according to the writ.
C—PARTIES.
13. All such persons as by the common law may join the
plaintiffs or defendants in the said writs of replevin, as well
without process as by process, shall and may join the said plain
tiffs or defendants, as well without process as by process, and
have like pleas and like advantages in all things (pleas of dis
claimer only excepted i, as they might have had by the common
law before the making of this act.
14. In any action of replevin, where there is a sole plaintiff,
or defendant, if either die, the action shall not abate; but the
death of such party being suggested upon the record, and the
name of the executor or administrator of such deceased party
being entered upon the record, the action shall proceed to final
judgment at the suit of the plaintiff, or if he be dead, at the
suit of his executor or administrator against the defendant, or
if he be dead, against his executor or administrator.
15. The parties to such action of replevin, and their executors
or administrators, shall have the like remedy upon any bond
given pursuant to this act as the original party would have had

PRACTICE OF LAW.

681

if both parties were living at the time of pursuing such remedy ;
and the sheriff or other officer taking any bond in an action of
replevin, shall assign the same to the then plaintiff, in case the
original plaintiff would have been entitled to the same, if there
had been no death, or to the then defendant in case the original
defendant would have been entitled to the same if, there had
been no death.
D.—PLEADING AND PRACTICE.
16. The pleadings shall be filed within the times limited for
filing pleadings in personal actions, and the same proceedings
may be taken in case of the failure to file the pleadings as are
prescribed in like cases by the practice in personal actions.
17. The plaintiff shall bring on the trial of the cause as in
other actions, and shall be liable to judgment of nonsuit for
failure to do so.
18. If the plaintiff shall be nonsuit for failure to file his
pleadings, or to bring on the trial of the cause as required by
law, the court, besides a judgment of nonsuit, shall, in all cases,
except where the taking was as a distress for rent, award a
return of the goods and chattels to the defendant if they have
not been redelivered to him by the sheriff or coroner ; and the
defendant shall thereupon be entitled to his costs, and the same
remedy in all respects upon the replevin bond, as he would be
entitled to on the awarding of the return of the goods and chat
tels on the verdict of a jury.
19. In any action of replevin, where the goods or chattels
replevied shall not be delivered to the plaintiff, by reason of a
claim thereto made by the defendant, of property in himself, it
shall not be lawful for the defendant to plead any plea, avowry,
or cognizance justifying the taking of the same as the property
of an}' person other than himself.
20. ^Except in the cases provided for in the last preceding sec
tion, the plaintiff and defendant in replevin may have like pleas,
avowries, cognizances, and justifications (pleas of disclaimer ex
cepted), as they might have had before the making of this act,'
4i

682

PRACTICE OF LAW.

and as though the said avowry, cognizance, or justification had
been made after the order of the common law.
21. Whensoever any lands, tenements, or hereditaments are
held by any person, by rents, customs, or services, if the person
of whom such lands, tenements, or hereditaments are held, shall
distrain upon the same for any such rents, customs, or services,
and replevin thereof be sued, the person of whom the said lands,
tenements, or hereditaments are so holden- may avow, or his or
her bailiff or servant make cognizance, or justify, the taking of
the said distress upon the lands, tenements, or hereditaments so
holden, as in lands, tenements, or hereditaments within his or
her fee, alleging, in the said avowry, cognizance, and justifica
tion, the said lands, tenements, or hereditaments to be holden
of him or her, without naming any person certain to be tenant
of the same, and without making any avowry, cognizance, or
justification upon any person certain.
2.'. The defendant in replevin may avow or make cognizance
generally, that the plaintiff in replevin or other tenant of the
lands and tenements, whereon the distress was made, enjoyed
the same under a grant or demise at a certain rent, during the
time wherein the rent distrained for accrued, which rent was
then and still remains due, without further setting forth the
grant, tenure, demise, or title of such landlord or landlords, les
sor or lessors, owner or owners.
23. In all cases where the goods and chattels have been taken
as a distress for rent, if the plaintiff in replevin shall be nonsuit
before issue joined, and the defendant shall make a suggestion
in the nature of an avowry or cognizance for such rent, the
court, upon the prayer of the defendant, instead of awarding a
return of the distress, shall award a writ to the sheriff or coro
ners of the county where the distress was taken, to inquire, by
the oath or affirmation of twelve good and lawful men of his
bailiwick, touching the sum in arrear for such rent, at the time
of such distress taken, or the value of the goods or chattels dis
trained, and fifteen days' notice being given to the plaintiff or
his attorney of the sitting of such inquiry, the sheriff or coro
ner shall thereupon inquire of the truth of the matters contained

PRACTICE OF LAW.

6»3

in such writ, by the oath or affirmation of twelve good and law
ful men of his county ; and upon the return of such inquisition,
the defendant shall have judgment to recover against the plain
tiff the arrearages of such rent, in case the goods and chattels
distrained shall amount to that value; and in case they shall
not amount to that value, then so much as the value of the
goods and chattels so distrained shall amount to, together with
his full costs of suit, and shall have execution thereon for the
same by capias ad satisfaciendum, fieri facias, or otherwise ; and
in case such plaintiff shall be nonsuit, after cognizance or avowry
made and issue joined, or if the verdict shall be given against
such plaintiff, then the jurors impanelled or returned to inquire
of such issue, shall, at the prayer of the defendant, inquire con
cerning the sum of the arrears and the value of the goods and
chattels distrained, and thereupon the avowant or the person
who makes cognizance shall have judgment for such arrearages,
or so much thereof as the goods and chattels distrained amount
to, together with his full costs, and shall have like execution
for the same as aforesaid.
24. If judgment be given upon demurrer for the avowant, or
person making cognizance for rent, the court, instead of award
ing a return of the distress, shall, at the prayer of the defendant,
award a writ to inquire of the value of such distress, and upon
the return thereof, judgment shall be given for the avowant or
person making cognizance as aforesaid, for the arrears alleged
to be due in such avowry or cognizance, if the goods and chat
tels so distrained shall amount to that value; and in case they
do not amount to that value, then for so much as the said goods
and chattels, so distrained, amount to, together with his full
costs of suit, and shall have like execution for the same, as
aforesaid.
25. In all actions of replevin, except where the goods and
chattels have been taken as a distress for rent, if the plaintiff
shall be nonsuit before issue joined, or for not bringing on the
cause for trial, or judgment be given for the defendant upon de
murrer, and the goods have not been redelivered to the defend
ant by the sheriff, the court, instead of awarding a return of

684

PRACTICE OF LAW.

the goods and chattels, shall, on the application of the defendant
upon a suggestion of property in such defendant, award a writ
of inquiry to ascertain the value of such goods and chattels,
and the damages of the defendant, which writ of inquiry shall
be awarded, executed, and returned in the same manner as writs
of inquiry for the assessment of damages in personal actions ;
and upon the return of such inquisition, the defendant shall
have judgment against the plaintiff* for the value of the goods
and chattels and damages so found, together with his costs of
suit, and shall have execution thereon by a capias ad satisfacien
dum, or by a fieri facias against the goods and chattels, lands
and tenements of the plaintiff in replevin; and if upon the trial
of an issue of property in the defendant, a verdict shall be given
against the plaintiff, the jurors impanelled to try such issue,
shall, at the prayer of the defendant, find the value of the prop
erty of the defendant in such goods and chattels, and his dam
ages ; and the defendant shall thereupon have judgment for the
sum so found, together with his costs of suit, and shall have like
execution for the same as aforesaid ; provided, the defendant
shall have given the plaintiffs attorney a notice in writing, fif
teen days before the trial, of his intention to require the jury
to find the value of the goods and damages, in case a verdict
should be found for the defendant.
26. In all actions of replevin, except where the taking was as
a distress for rent, if the property replevied shall have been de
livered by the sheriff or coroner to the party against whom the
issue of property shall be found, the party succeeding on such
issue, may, instead of pursuing his remedy for the damages, by
execution or by action on the bond, apply to the court in which
the action is pending, for an order that the said goods and
chattels be restored to him ; and thereupon it shall be lawful for
the court in its discretion to make an order that the said goods
and chattels be delivered to the party in whom the property
therein has been found, and to enforce the performance of such
order by a writ in the nature of a writ of restitution, or by an
attachment as for contempt ; and the party succeeding in such
action may, notwithstanding such order, recover his costs in the
suit by execution as in other cases.

PRACTICE OF LAW.

685

27. In all actions of replevin if the plaintiff be nonsuit, or a
verdict be found in favor of the defendant, the defendant shall ,
recover his damages and costs against the plaintiff, if the plain
tiff would have recovered damages and costs, if he had sue- f
ceeded in the action ; provided, that in all actions of replevin for
goods and chattels taken as a distress, the jury trying the same
or to whom the question of damages shall be submitted, shall
determine by their verdict whether the plaintiff or defendant
shall pay the costs of the suit, or whether each party shall pay
his own costs.
28. In cases where the property has been delivered to the
plaintiff by the officer, if the defendant does not appear and
make defence, but suffers judgment to be entered by default,
there shall be no judgment for damages or costs, except in case
of a demand being made in writing before the commencement
of the action, and the refusal of the defendant to deliver the
property in pursuance thereof; and in such case the plaintiff shall
be at liberty to suggest the facts upon the record, and instead
of taking judgment by default, may enter a discontinuance of
the action without costs.
29. In actions upon replevin bonds, the costs taxed in the
original action shall be included as part of the damages to be
assessed therein.
30. When any sheriff or coroner shall have taken any bond
by virtue of this act, and such sheriff or coroner shall die, ab
scond, or remove out of this State before assigning such bond, it
shall be lawful for any successor in office of such sheriff or cor
oner, by order of the court in which the action was brought, to
assign such bond in writing, under his hand and seal, to the
party entitled to the same, or to his lawful representatives, who
are hereby authorized, if the said bond shall become forfeited,
to bring an action and recover thereon in his or their own
names.
