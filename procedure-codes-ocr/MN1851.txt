Sec. 90. The court may, at any time in furtherance of justice, and
on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding by
adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or when the amendment ,

Sec. 4. It may be issued to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board,

to the discharge of any of its functions, it cannot control judicial discretion.

SEC. 5. This writ ought not to be issued, in any case, where there

law. It is issued on the information of the party beneficially interested.

cause before the court, out of wliiclieilnc writ issued, at a specified time

and place, why he has not done so; and that he then and there return the writ, with his certificate of having done as he is commanded,
The peremptory writ must be in a similar form, except that the words
requiring the defendant to show cause why he has not done as commanded, must be omitted. ,

SEC. 7. When the right to re uire the performance of the act is

been served, may show cause by answer, made in the same manner as
an answer to_a complaint in a civil action.

SEC. 10. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandate must be allowed against the defendant; if an answer be made coutaini new
matter, the same shall not in any respect conclude the plaint' , who
may, on the trial or other proceedings, avail himself of an valid. objection to its sufficiency ; or may eountervail it by proof, eit er in direct
denial, or by way of avoidance.

Sec. 11. No other leading or written allegation, is allowed than

must be tried and the further proceedings had, in the same manner as
in a civil action.

SEC. 12. Issues of fact, joined in the case of mandamus where the
same is issued out of the supreme court, may be tried as provided in
the next section. .
