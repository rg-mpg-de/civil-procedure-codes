3. The complaint shall state, in a plain and direct manner, the facts con
stituting the cause of action.
4. The answer may contain a denial of the complaint, or of any pail
thereof, and also rlotice in a plain and direct manner of any facts cousti
tilting a defense or counterclaim.
5. Pleadings are not required to be in any particular form, but must be
such as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is in
tended.

thereof, when it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to understand it
or it contains no cause of action or defense, although it be taken as true.

pleading to be amended, and if the party refuse to amend, the defective
pleading shall be disregarded. /

recover, without proving his case.
9. In an action or defense, founded upon an account or an instrument

shall be issued by him to the sheriff of the county, and have the same effect,
and be executed in the same manner as other executions and judgments of
the county court, except as provided in section sixty-three. • •
14. The court may, at the joining of issue, require either party, at the
request of the other, at that or some other specified time, to exhibit his
account on demand, or state the nature thereof as far forth as may be in his
power, and, in case of his default, preclude him from giving evidence of
such parts thereof as shall not have been so exhibited or stated.

actions, the rules of evidence, the times of commencing actions, and the
service of process upon corporations, shall apply to these courts.

before any other proceedings shall be had in the action, determine whether
he will accept or reject such offer. If he accept the offer, and gives notice
thereof in writing, the justice shall file the offer and the acceptance thereof,
and render judgment accordingly. If notice of acceptance be not given,

tives, on application and sufficient cause shown at any time before judgment,
must be allowed to defend the action ; and, except in an action for divorce,

may, in like manner, upon good cause shown, be allowed to defend after
judgment, or at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within
seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just ; and if the
defense be successful, and the judgment, or any part thereof, have been
collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution may thereupon be com
pelled as the court directs ; but the title to property sold under such
judgment to a purchaser in good faith shall not be thereby affected. And
in all cases where publication is made, the gomplaint must be first filed,
and the summons, as published, must state the time and place of such
filing.
In actions for the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, already insti
tuted, or hereafter to be instituted, if any party or parties, having any
interest in, or lien upon, such mortgaged premises, are unknown to the
plaintiff, and the residence of such party or parties cannot, with reasonable
diligence, be ascertained by him, and such fact shall be made to appear, by
•Jitfidavit, to the court, or to a justice thereof, or to the county judge of the
county where the trial is to he had, such court, justice, or county judge
may grant an order that the summons he served on such unknown party or
parties hy puhlishing the same for six weeks, once in each week succes
sively, in the State paper and in a newspaper printed in the county where
the premises are situated, which publication shall be equivalent to a personal
service on such unknown party or parties.

eral defendants, and part only served.

served on one or more of them, but not on all of them, the plaintiff may
proceed as follows :

he may proceed against the defendant served, unless the court otherwise
direct ; and if he recover judgment it may be entered against all the
defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced
against the joint property of all and the separate property of the defend
ants served, and, if they are subject to arrest, against the persons of the.
defendants served ; or
2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may proceed
against the defendants served in the same manner as if they were the only
defendants ;
3. If all the defendants have been served, judgment may be taken
against any or either of them severally, when the plaintiff would be entitled
to judgment against such defendant or defendants if the action had been
against them or any of them alone ;
4. If the name of one or more partners shall, for any cause, have been
omitted in any action in which judgment shall have passed against the
defendants named in the summons, and such omission shall not have been
pleaded in such action, the plaintiff, in case the judgment therein shall
remain unsatisfied, may by action recover of such partner separately, upon

§ 157. [133.] (Am'd 1849, 1851.) Verification, mode of.
The verification must be to the effect that the same is true to the knowl

be by the affidavit of the party ; or, if there be several parties united in
interest, and pleading together, by one at least of such parties acquainted
with the facts, if such party be within the county where the attorney resides,
and capable of making the affidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the
agent or attorney, if the action or defense be founded upon a written instru
ment for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the posses
sion of the agent or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the plead
ing be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the
pleading is verified by any other person than the party, he shall set forth
in the affidavit his knowledge, or the grounds of his belief, on the subject,
and the reasons why it is not made by the party. When a corporation is a
party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof; and when the
State, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is a party, the verification may be
made by any person acquainted with the facts. The verification may
be omitted when an admission of the truth of the allegation might subject
the party to prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used in a

in such pleading.

of his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent
or attorney, to the ellect that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from
giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a county judge,
may order a further account when the one delivered is defective, and the
court may in all cases order a bill of particulars of the claim of either party
to be furnished.

§ 159. [136.] Pleadings to be liberally construed.
In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its
effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view of subtantial
justice between the parties.

§ 160. f 137. j (Am'dl849.) Irrelevant and redundant mailer to be
stricken out.
If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be

pleading shall he hound to establish, on the trial, tho facts conferring
jurisdiction.

§ 162. [139.] (Am'd 1851.) Conditions precedent, how to be pleaded.
In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it
shall not he necessary to state the facts showing such performance ; but it
may be stated, generally, that the party duly performed all the conditions on

money only, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a copy of the instru
ment, and to state that there is due to him thereon from the adverse party
a specified sum which he claims

§ 162. [140. J Private statutes, how to be pleaded.
In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be
sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and
the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof

§ 1624. [141.] Libel and slander, how slated in complaint.
In an action for libel or slander it shall not be necessary to state in the
complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application
to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action
arose ; but it shall be sufficient to state, generally, that the same was pub
lished or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allegation be contro
verted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so
published or spoken.

§ 162. [142.] (Am'd 1849.) Answer in such cases.
In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his
answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any
mitigating circumstances, to reduce the/amount of damages; and, whether
he prove the justification or not, lie may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances.

§ 166. In actions to recover property distrained for damage, answer
need not set forth title.
In an action to recover the possession of property distrained doing
damage, an answer that the defendant, or person by whose command he
acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress
was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing damage
thereon, shall be good, without setting forth the title to such real property.
§ 167. [143.] (Am'd, 1849, 1852, 1863.) What causes of action may be
joined in the same action.
The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several causes of action,
whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equita
ble, or both, where they all arise out of,
1. The same transaction or transactions connected with the same subject
of action ;
2. Contract, express or implied ; or
3. Injuries, with or without force, to person and property, or either ; or
4. Injuries to character ; or
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages, for with
holding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same ; or
6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages foi
the withholding thereof ; or
7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation ot
law.
But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one of these
classes, and, except in actions for the foreclosure of mortgages, must affect
all the parties to the action, and not require different places of trial, and
must be separately stated.
In actions to foreclose mortgages the court shall have power to adjudge
and direct the payment, by the mortgagor, of any residue of the mortgage
debt that rauv remain unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises, in
cases in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the debt secured
by such mortgage ; and if the mortgage debt be secured by the covenant
or obligation of any person other than the mortgagor, the plaintiff may
make such person a party to the action, and the court may adjudge pay
ment of the residue of such debt remaining unsatisfied after a sale of the
mortgaged premises against such other person, and may enforce such judg
ment as in other cases.

§ 16B. [144.] (Am'd 1849, 1802.) Allegation not denied; when to be
deemed true.
Every material allegation of the complaint, not controverted by the
answer, as prescribed in section 149 ; and every material allegation of new
matter in the answer, constituting a counterclaim, not controverted by the
reply, as prescribed in section 153, shall, for the purposes of the action, be
taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating
to a counterclaim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted
by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may
require

§ 169. [145.] (Am'd 1849.) Material variances, how provided for.
No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof shall be
leemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his
prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense, upon the merits. Whenever
it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled;
and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such
terms as shall be just.

§ 170. [146.] Immaterial variances, how provided for.
Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the
court may direct the fact to he found according to the evidence, or may
order an immediate amendment, without costs.

§ 171. [147.] What to be denned a variance.
Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defense to
which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some particular or particu
lars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case
of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

§ 172- [148. J Am'd 1849, 1851, 1859.) Amendments of course.
Any pleading may be once amended by the party, of course, without
costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had. at any time
within twenty days after it is served, or at any time before the period for
answering it expires, or, it can be so amended at any time within twenty
days after the service of the answer or demurrer to such pleading, unless it
be made to appear to the court that it was done for the purposes of delay,
and the plaintiff or defendant will thereby lose the benefit of a circuit or
term for which the cause is or may be noticed ; and if it appear to the
court that such amendment was made for such purpose, the same may be
stricken out and such terms imposed as to the court may seem just. In
such case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the adverse
party. After the decision of a demurrer, either at a general or special
term, the court may, in its discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was
interposed in good faith, allow the party to plead over upon such terms as
may be just. If the demurrer be allowed for the cause mentioned in the
fifth subdivision of section 144, the court may, in its discretion, and upon
such terms as may be just, order the action to be divided into as many
actions as may be necessary to the proper determination of the causes of
action therein mentioned.

§ 173. [149.] (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1852.) Amendments by the court.
The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and
on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process or proceed
ing, by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by
inserting other allegations material to the case, or when the amendment
does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the
pleading or proceeding to the facts proved.

§ 174:. [149.] (Am'dl851.) Amendments after demurrer.
The court may likewise, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be
just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other act to be done, after
the time limited by this act, or, by an order, enlarge such time ; and may
also, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time
within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order,
or other proceeding, taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect ; and may supply an omission in any proceed
ing ; and whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any
respect, to the provisions of this G)de, the court may, in like manner and
upon like terms, permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make

be double the amount so appraised.
And the plaintiff may, within three days after receiving written notice
of the tiling of such undertaking, give notice to the sheriff that he excepts
to the sufficiency of the sureties. If he fails so to do, he shall be deemed
to have waived all objection to them. When the plaintiff excepts, the
sureties shall justify on notice in like manner as upon bail on arrest.
And the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties,
and may retain possession of the property attached, and the proceeds thereof
in his hands, until the objection to them is cither waived, as above provided,
or until they shall justify, or new sureties shall be substituted and justify.
And in all cases the defendant may move to discharge the attachment,
as in the case of other provisional remedies.
And when there is more than one defendant, and several property of
either of the defendants has been seized by virtue of the order of attach
ment, the defendant, whose several property has been seized, may deliver
to the court or officer an undertaking in accordance with the provisions of
this section, to the effect that he will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the
amount of judgment that may be recovered against such defendant.
And all the provisions of this section applicable to such undertaking
shall be applied thereto.

§ 242. When sheriff to return warrant, and proceedings thereon.

The sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees and compensation for ser
vices, and the same disbursements, under this title, as are allowed by law
for like services and disbursements under the provisions of chapter live,
title one, and part two of the revised statutes. Provided, however, that no
poundage or other compensation shall be allowed to the said sheriff (ex
cept his fee of fifty cents for making the levy, and such compensation for
his trouble and expense in taking possession of and preserving the property
as shall be fixed by the officer issuing the attachment), unless a settlement
shall be had or a judgment shall be recovered and collected in whole or in
part in the action in which the attachment in this title referred to shall

lected in part only, the amount of his poundage shall not be estimated
upon any sum greater than the sum collected upon such judgment. And
where a settlement shall be had, the amount of his poundage shall not be
estimated upon any sum greater than the amount at which said settlement

§ 244. (Am'd 1851, 1852, 1857, 1858, 1862, 1867.) Powers of court as to
receivers, deposit of money, etc., in court, and other provisional remedies.
A receiver may he appointed :
1. Before judgment, on the application of cit her party, when he estab
lishes an apparent right to the property which is the subject of the action,
anil which is in the possession of an adverse party, and the property, or its
rents and profits, are in danger of being lost or materially injured or
impaired, except in -cases where judgment upon failure to answer maybe
had without application to the court ;
2. After judgment, to carry the judgment into effect ;
3. After judgment, to dispose of the property according to the judgment,
or to preserve it during the pendency of an appeal, or when an execution
has been returned unsatisfied, and the judgment debtor refuses to apply his

corporation hits been dissolved, or is insolvent, or in imminent danger of
insolvency, or h;is forfeited it corporate rights ; and in like cases of the

party, with or without security, subject to the further direction of the
court.
Whenever, in the exercise of its authority, a court shall have ordered
the deposit, delivery or conveyance of money or other property, and the
order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the disobedience, as for
contempt, may make an order requiring the sheriff to take the money or
property, and deposit, deliver or convey it, in conformity with the direc
tion of the court.
When the answer of the defendant, expressly or by not denying, admits
part of the plaintiff's claim to be just, the court, on motion, may order such
defendant to satisfy that part of the claim, and may enforce the order as it
enforces a judgment or provisional remedy.

§ 245. [201.] Judgment ; what
A judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in the
or-tion.

§ 246. [202.J (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1858.) Judgment on failure of defendant

1. In any action arising on contract for the recovery of money only,
the plaintiff may file with the clerk proof of personal service of the sum
mons and complaint on one or more of the defendants, or of the summons,
according to the provisions of section 130; and that no answer has been
received. The clerk shall thereupon enter judgment for the amount men
tioned in the summons, against the defendant or defendants, or against one
or more of several defendants, in the cases provided for in section 136. But
if the complaint be not sworir to, and such action is on an instrument for
the payment of money only, the clerk, on its production to him, shall
assess the amount due to the plaintiff thereon; and in other cases shall
ascertain the amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in such action,
from his examination under oath, or other proof, and enter the judgment
for the amount so assessed or ascertained. In case the defendant give
notice of appearance in the action he shall be entitled to five days' notice
of the time and place of such assessment. •
Where the defendant by his answer in any such action shall not deny
the plainiiff's claim, but shall set up a counterclaim amounting to less than
the plaintiff's claim, judgment may be had by the plaintiff for the excess
of said claim, over the said counterclaim, in like manner in any such action,
upon the plaintiff's filing with the clerk of the court a statement admitting
such counterclaim, which statement shall be annexed to and bo a part of
the judgment roll ;
2. In other actions the plaintiff may, upon the like proof, apply to the
court, after the expiration of the time for answering, for the relief demanded
in the complaint. If the taking of an account or the proof of any fact be
necessary to enable the court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment
into effect, the court may take the account or hear the proof, or may, in its
discretion, order a refcreuce for that purpose. And where the action is for
the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property, with
damages for the withholding thereof, the court may order the damages to
be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long account be involved,
by a reference as above provided. If the defendant give notice of appear
ance in the action before the expiration of the time for answering, he shall
be entitled to eight days' notice of the time and place of application to the
court for the relief demanded by the complaint ;
3. In actions where the service of the summons was by publication, the
plaintiff may, in like manner, apply for judgment, and the court must there
upon require proof to be made of the demand mentioned in the complaint,
and if the defendant be not a resident of the State, must require the plaint
iff or his agent to be examined on oath respecting any payments that have
been made to the plaintiff or to any one for his use, on account of such
demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to
recover. Before rendering judgment the court may, in its discretion,
require the plaintiff to cause to be tiled satisfactory security to abide the
order of the court, touching the restitution of any estate or effects which
may be directed by such judgment to be transferred or delivered, or the
restitution of any money that may be collected under or by virtue of such
judgment, in case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and be
admitted to defend the action, and shall succeed in such defense.

Issues arise upon the pleadings, when a fact or conclusion of law Is
maintained by the one party and controverted by the other. They are of
two kinds :
1. Of law; and
2. Of fact.

§ 249. [204.] Issue of law.
An issue of law arises,
1. Upon a demurrer to the complaint, answer or reply, or to some part
thereof.
§ 250. [205.] (Am'd 1849.) Issue of fact.
An issue of fact arises,
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint controverted by the
2. Upon new matter in the answer controverted by the reply ; or,
3. Upon new matter in the reply, except an issue of law is joined
thereon.

§ 251. [206.] On issues of both law and fact, the issue of law to be first
tried.
Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon different parts of the
pleadings in the same action. In such cases the issues of law must be first
tried unless the court otherwise direct.

§ 252. [207.] (Am'd 1851, 1852.) Trial, what.
A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between the parties,
whether they be issues of law or of fact.

§ 253. [208.] (Am'd 1849, 1852.) Issue offact to be tried by jury, unless
waived or reference ordered.
An issue of law must be tried by the court, unless it be referred, as
provided in sections 270 and 271. An issue of fact, in an action for the

Every othor issue is triable by the court, which, however, may order
the whole issue, or any specific question of fact involved therein, to be tried
by a jury ; or may refer it, as provided in sections 270 and 271.

§ 255. [2 10. J (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1852.) All issues to be tried before a
single judge.
All issues of fact, triable by a jury or by the court, must be tried before
a single judge. Issues of fact in the supreme court must be tried at a cir
cuit court when the trial is by jury, otherwise at a circuit court or special
term, as the court may by its rules prescribe. Issues of law must be tried
at a circuit court or special term, and shall, unless the court otherwise direct,
have preference on the calendar.

§ 256. [211.] (Am'd 1858, 1859, 1860, 1863, 1865, 1869.) Either party may
give notice of trial. Note of issue. Stenographer.
At any time after issue, and at least fourteen days before the court,
either party may give notice of trial. The party giving the notice shall
furnish the clerk, at least eight days before the court, with a note of the
issue, containing the title of the action, the names of the attorneys, and the
time when the last pleading was' served, and the clerk shall thereupon
enter the cause upon the calendar according to the date of the issue. In
the first judicial district there need be but one notice of trial, and one note
of issue from either party, and the action shall (hen remain on the calendar
until disposed of, and, when called, may be brought to trial by the party
giving the notice. In every action in which issue of the fact is now joined,
and the action is now placed upon the calendar of the supreme court of the
first judicial district, or of the superior court of the city of New York, or
of the court of common pleas for the city and county of New York, the
party who shall have filed such note of issue, shall, as a condition prece
dent to such action being brought to trial, pay to the clerk of the court the
sum of three dollars ; and in every action in either of the said courts, com
menced after the passage of this act, the party who shall tile therein a first
note of issue of fact, shall, its a condition precedent to such filing, pay to
the clerk of the court the sum of three dollars ; and the amounts so received
Shall be accounted for under oath, and paid over monthly, by the clerk of
each of said courts, to the comptroller of the city of New York, and by him
deposited in the county treasury, to be used as a fund for the payment ot
the salaries of stenographers employed in said courts, as provided for in
this section. If the fund thus created be inadequate to pay such salaries,
the additional amount necessary for such payment shall be appropriated
and paid from the fund of county contingencies, to which fund any surplus
of the sums so paid over to the comptroller, as hereinbefore provided, shall
be credited.
Each of the courts hereinbefore named shall appoint a stenographer for
the circuit, trial term or special term, at which issues of fact are tried, which
constitutes a separate branch of such court, who shall be a sworn officer of
the court, shall hold office during the pleasure of the court, and shall be
paid a salary of twenty-five hundred dollars per annum, in like manner as
the salaries of the other officers of the courts are now paid. It shall be the
duty of every stenographer so appointed for any circuit, trial term or
special term, under the direction of the presiding judge thereof, to take
full stenographic notes of all proceedings in every trial thereat ; and in
case the presiding judge shall require a transcript of said stenographic
notes, he may order the expense thereof to be paid equally by the parties
to the action, at the rate of ten cents for every one hundred words so trans
cribed, and may enforce payment thereof ; and the amount so paid, together
with the sum paid as a condition precedent to the cause being brought to
trial, or to the first note of issue being filed, as hereinbefoie provided, shall
be deemed a necessary disbursement within the meaning of section 311 of
the Code of procedure, and shall be allowed as such to the prevailing party
in the action.
At any extra circuit, trial term or special term of said courts, the pre
siding judge thereof shall, appoint a stenographer for such extra circuit or
term, who shall, in like manner as aforesaid, be a sworn officer, and who
shall be paid a compensation at the rate and in the manner hereinbefore
provided. When a court of oyer and terminer shall be held in and for the
city and county of New York, the presiding judge thereof shall designate
one of the stenographers of the supreme court to act as stenographer of
sucli court of oyer and terminer during its session, who shall, in like
manner as aforesaid, be a sWoru officer, but who shall receive no compen
sation in addition to his salary as hereinbefore provided, except that in case
a transcript of his stenographic notes taken on the trial of any criminal cause
be required for the use of the presiding judge, or the district attorney, the
expense thereof shall, on the order of such judge or district attorney, be
paid as a county charge at the rate hereinbefore specified.
The surrogate of the county of New York is hereby authorized 'and
directed to appoint a stenographer to the surrogate's court of said county,
who shall be a sworn officer of the court, and shall he paid a salary of three
thousand dollars a year, in like manner as the salaries of clerks in said
court are now paid by law from the fees of said court paid into the treasury
of the county of New York. The stenographer so appointed shall be skilled
in the practice of his art, and shall hold his position during good behavior,
and so long as he efficiently discharges the duties of his office. He shall,
under the direction of the said surrogate, take full stenographic notes of all
proceedings in said court, in which oral proofs shall be given, which notes
shall be fairly transcribed, and, after being signed by the witnesses, depo
nent or affiant, shall be filed in the office of said surrogate. By consent of
the parties to the proceeding in which such proofs shall be taken, and said
surrogate, the signing of such record of proof by the witness, deponent or
affiant, may be waived, in which case such record, after being authenticated
by the certificate of said stenographer, or said surrogate, shall be deemed
to be the record of any proofs or proceedings so taken.
In other counties of this State, on trials of issues of fact, at any circuit
court, or court of oyer and terminer, it shall be lawful for the presiding
justice, in his discretion, to employ a stenographer, who shall be entitled
to such compensation as shall be certified by such justice, not exceed
ing five dollars for each day's attendance at such court, at the request of
such justice, and ten cents a mile for travel from his place of residence to
the place where the court is held, together with such sum for stationery as
the presiding justico shall certify, whicli compensation shall be a charge
upon the comities in which such courts shall be held respectively, and shall
be allowed, and paid from the court fund, in like manner as other charges
are allowed and paid from it. It shall be the duty of such stenographer to
furnish to any party to such trials, upon request, a copy of the evidence
and proceedings taken by hini on such trials, or of such part thereof as may
be required, on payment, on* behalf -of such party, of ten cents for every
one hundred words of the copy so furnished. In the surrogates' courts of
the counties of Now York and Kings, and of other counties in which a
stenographer is or shall be duly authorized to take stenographic notes of
proceedings in said courts, in which oral proofs shall be given, in case of
the death of any witness, deponent or affiant, after examination and before
the stenographer's notes of such examination shall have been transcribed,
such notes, after being fairly transcribed' and authenticated by the certifi
cate of the surrogate, shall be tiled in his office, and be deemed to be the
record of the proofs so taken, without any signing thereof by such witnesses.

§ 257. [2 12. J Order of disposing of issues on the calendar.
The issues on the calendar shall be disposed of in the following order ;
unless, for the convenience of parties, or the dispatch of business, the court
shall otherwise direct :
1 . Issues of fact to be tried by a jury ;
2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court ;
3. Issues of law.

§ 258. [2 13. J (Am'd 1851.) Either party may bring issue to trial.
Either party giving the notice, may bring the issue to trial, and in the
absence of the adverse party, unless the court, for good cause, otherwise
direct, may proceed with his case, and take a dismissal of the complaint, or
a verdict or judgment, as the case may require. A separate trial between a
plaintiff and any of the several defendants, may be allowed by the court,

of defendant, if any shall have been made. When the issue shall be
brought to trial by the defendant, and the plaintiff shall neglect or refuse
to furnish the court with a copy of the summons and pleadings and the
offer of the defendant, the same may be furnished by the defendant.
§ 260. [215.] (Am'd 1849.) General and special verdicts defined.
A general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce generally upon
all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A
special verdict is that by which the jury rind the facts only, leaving the
judgment to the court.

§ 261. [216.] (Am'd 1849.) Verdict in action for recovery of specific
personal properly, when in action for recovery of money only, or real prop
erty, jury may render either general or special verdict ; and when court may
direct special finding. ■
In an action for the recovery of specific personal property, if the prop
erty have not been delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant by his answer
claim a return thereof, the jury shall assess the value of the property, if
their verdict bo in favor of the plaintiff ; or, if they find in favor of the
defendant, and that he is entitled to a return thereof; and may, at the same

which the prevailing party hits sustained by reason of the detention or
taking and withholding such property.
In every action for the recovery of money only, or specific real property,
I he jury, in their discretion, may render a general or special verdict. In
all other cases the court may direct the jury to rind a special verdict, in
writing, upon all or any of the issues ; and in all cases may instruct them,
if they render a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact,
to be stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The

minutes.

§ 262. [217.]

Where a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent with the general
verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall give judg
ment accordingly.

§ 263. [218.] (Am'd 1851.) In actions for recovery of money only, jur%
to assess damages.
When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an action for the recovery
of money, or for the defendant when a set-off for the recovery of money it
established, beyond the amount of the plaintiff's claim as established, tht
jury must also assess the amount of the recovery ; they may also, mule*
the direction of the court, assess the amount of the recovery when the cour*
give judgment for the plaintiff on the answer. If a set-off, established at
the trial, exceed the plaintiff's demand so established, judgment for the
defendant must be given for the excess ; or if it appear that the defendant
is entitled to any other affirmative relief, judgment must be giveu accord
ingly-

§ 264. [219.] (Am'd 1851, 1852.) Entry of verdict.
Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make an entry in his minutes,
specifying the time and place of the trial, the names of the jurors and wit
nesses, the verdict, and either the judgment rendered thereon, or an order
that the cause be reserved for argument or further consideration. If a dif
ferent direction be not given by the court, the clerk must enter judgment
in conformity with the verdict. If an exception be taken, it may be
reduced to writing at the time, or entered in the judge's minutes and after
ward settled as provided by the rules of the court, and then stated in
writing in a case, or separately, with so much of the evidence as may be
material to the questions to be raised, but need not be sealed or signed, nor
need a bill of exceptions be made. If the exceptions be in the first
instance stated in a case, and. it be afterwards necessary to separate thom,
the separation may be made under the direction of the court, or a judge
thereof. The judge who tries the cause may, in his discretion, entertain a
motion to bo made on his minutes to set aside a verdict and grant a new
trial upon exceptions, or for insufficient evidence, or for excessive damages ;
but such motion in actions hereafter tried, if heard upon the minutes, can
only be heard at the same term or circuit at which the trial is had. When
such motion is heard, and decided upon the minutes of the judge, and an
appeal is taken from the decision, a case or exceptions must l>e settled in
the usual form, upon which the argument of the appeal must be had.

§ 265. [220.] (Am'd 1851, 1852, 1857.) Judgment, when to be entered ;
motion for new trial on a case or exceptions; directing verdict subject to opin
ion of court,
A motion for a new trial, on a case or exceptions, or otherwise, and an
application for judgment on a special verdict or case reserved for argument
or further consideration, must in the first instance be heard and decided at
the circuit or special teem, except that when exceptions are taken, the judge
trying the cause may, at the trial, direct them to be heard in the first in
stance at the general term, add the judgment in the meantime suspended ;
and in that case they must be there heard in the first instance, and judg
ment there given. And when upon a trial the case presents only questions
of law, the judge may direct a verdict subject to the opinion of the court
at the general term, and in that case the application for judgment must be
made at the general term. Every judgment rendered upon a verdict, taken
subject to the opinion of the court at a general term, may be reviewed by
the court of appeals in the same manner and with the like effect as if excep
tions had been duly taken at the proper time ; provided it shall appear by
the return that questions of law were involved in the rendition of the judg
ment.

§ 266. [221.] (Am'd 1849.) Trial by jury, how waived.
Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties to an issue of fact

the manner following :
1. By failing to appear at the trial ;
2. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the clerk ;
3. By oral consent in open court, entered in the minutes.

§ 267. [222.J (Am'd 1840, 1800, 1865,1870.; On trial by the court, judg
ment to be given in twenty days.
Upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, its decision shall be
given in writing, and shall contain a statement of the facts found, and the
conclusions of law separately ; and upon a trial of an issue of law, the de
cision shall be made in the same manner stating the conclusions of law.
Such decisions shall be filed with the clerk within twenty clays after the
court at which the trial took place. Judgment upon the decision shall be
entered accordingly, four days thereafter. If upon motion by either party,
to a general or special term of the court, it shall be made to appear that the
decision is unreasonably delayed, the court may make an order absolute for
a new trial, or may order a new trial unless the decision shall be tiled by
a time to be speeitied in the order. The costs of the former trial shall
abide the event of the new trial.

§ 268. [223.] (Am'd 1851, 1852, 1860, 1867, 1869.) Exceptions, how and
to/ten taken.
For the purposes of an appeal either party may except to a decision on
a matter of law arising upon such trial within ten days after notice iu
writing of the judgment, in the same manner and with the same efl'ect as
upon a trial by jury, provided, however, that where the' decision filed under
section 267 does not authorize a final judgment, hut directs further proceed
ings before a referee or otherwise, either party may move for a new trial
at general term, and for that purpose may, within ten days after notice of
the decision being filed, except thereto, and make a case or exceptions, as
above provided in case of an appeal. And either party desiring a review
upon the evidence appearing on the trial, cither of the questions of fact or
of law, may, at any time within ten days after notice of the judgment, or
within such time as may be prescribed by the rules of the court, make a
case or exceptions in like manner as upon a trial by jury, except that the
judge, in settling the case, must briefly specify the facts found by him and
his conclusions of law. But the questions, whether of fact or of law, aris
ing upon the trial, can only be reviewed in the manner prescribed by this
section, the questions of law in every stage of the appeal, and the questions
of fact upon the appeal to the general term of the same court, as prescribed
in section 348.
No finding of facts oy the general term shall be required for the purpose
of review in the court of appeals, and if the judgment be reversed at the
general term, it shall not be deemed to have been reversed on questions of
fact, Unless so stated in the judgment of reversal ; and in that case the
questiou whether the judgment should have been reversed, either upon
questions of fact or of law, shall be open to review by the court of appeals.
And for the purposes of an appeal from a judgment rendered on a report
of a referee, or the decision of a judge on a trial without a jury, it shall
not be necessary to insert at large in the case the findings of fact or con
clusions of law of such judge or referee, or the exceptions thereto tiled, but
if the same appear as part of the judgment roll they may be referred to and
used on the argument of the appeal with the same effect as though inserted
in the case.
The provisions of this section, and also of section 272, as they are
hereby amended, shall apply to appeals now pending, as well as to those
hereafter brought.

§ 269. [224.J (Am'd 1849, 1851.) Proceedings upon judgment on issue
of law.
On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an issue of law, the plaintiff mayproceed
in the manner proscribed by the first two subdivisions of section
246, upon the failure of the defendant to answer, where the summons was
personally served. If judgment be for the defendant, upon an issue of
taw, and if taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, be necessary to
enable the court to complete the judgment, a reference or assessment by
jury may be ordered, as in that section provided.

§ 270. [225.] All issues referable by consent.
All or any of the issues in the action, whether of fact or of law, or both,
may be referred, upon the written consent of the parties.

§ 271. [226. J (Am'dl849.) When reference may be compulsorily or
dered.
Where the parties do not consent, the court may, upon the application
of either, or of its own motion, except where the investigation will require
the decision of difficult questions of law, direct a reference in the following
cases :
1. Where the trial of an issue of fact shall require the examination of a
long account on either side ; in which case, the referees may be directed to
hear and decide the whole issue, or to report upon any specific question of
fact involved therein ; or,
2. Where the taking of an account shall be necessary for the informa
tion of the court, before judgment, or for carrying a judgment or order
into effect ; or,

similar notice as a trial by the court. They shall have the same power to
grant adjournments and to allow amendments to any pleadings, and to the
summons, as the court upon such trial, upon the same terms and with the
like effect. They shall have the same power to preserve order and punish
all violation thereof, upon such trial, and to compel the attendance of wit
nesses before them by attachment, and to punish them as for a contempt
for non-attendance, or refusal to be sworn, or testify, as is possessed by the
court. They must state the facts found and the conclusions of law sepa
rately, and their decision must be given, and may be excepted to and re
viewed in like manner, and with like effect in all respects as in cases of ap
peal under section 268 ; and they may in like manner settle a case or ex
ceptions. The report of the referees upon the whole issue shall stand as
the decision of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same
manner as if the action had been tried by the court. When the reference
is to report the facts, the report shall have the effect of a special verdict.
When the case on appeal shall have been heard and decided at the gen
eral term, upon the report of the referee and exceptions, without a case
containing the evidence, the decision may be reviewed in like manner on
appeal to the court of appeals. If the judgment be reversed at the general
term, and a new trial ordered, it shall not be deemed to have been reversed
on questions of fact, unless so stated in the judgment of reversal ; and in
that case the question whether the judgment should have been reversed,
either upon questions of fact or of law, shall be open to review in the court
of appeals.

§ 273. [228.] (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1862, 1863, 1866.) Referees, how chosen.

such parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or more referees, not
more than three, who shall be free from exception. And no person shall
be appointed referee to whom all parties in the action shall object, except
in actions for divorce. And no judge or justice of any court shall sit as ref
eree in any action pending in the court of which he is judge or justice, and
not already referred, unless the parties otherwise stipulate. The referee or
referees shall make and deliver a report within sixty days from the time t;ie
action shall be finally submitted ; and in default thereof, and before the re
port is delivered, either party may serve notice upon the opposite party
that he elects to end the reference ; and thereupon the action shall pro
ceed as though no reference had been ordered, and the referees shall not,
in such case„ be entitled to any fees.

entitled. In an action against several defendants, the court may, in its dis
cretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to
proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment may be proper.
The court may also dismiss the complaint with costs, in favor of one or
more defendants, in case of unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiff
to serve the summons on other defendants, or to proceed in the cause
against the defendant or defendants served.
In an action brought by or against a married woman, judgment may be
given against her as well for costs as for damages, or both for such costs
and for such damages, in the same manner as against other persons, to bo

proceeding to enforce such judgment, the supreme court shall have jurisdic
tion, though the amount be less than one hundred dollars.

§ 275. [231.] The relief to be awarded to the plaintiff.
The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there bo uo answer, cannot exceed
that which he shall have demanded in his complaint ; but in any other case,

docketed, of every person against whom any such judgment shall be
rendered, and which' he may have at the time of the docketing thereof in
the county in which such real property is situated, or which he shall acquire
at any time thereafter, for ten years from the time of docketing the same in
the county where the judgment roll was filed. But the time during which
the party recovering or owing such judgment shall be or shall have been

order, or by the operation of any appeal, shall not constitute any part of
the ten years aforesaid, as against the defendant in such judgment, or the
party obtaining such orders or making such appeal, or any other person
who is not a purchaser, creditor or mortgagee in good faith. But whenever
an appeal from any judgment shall be pending, and the undertaking

property upon which said judgment is a lien, or a specific portion thereof
to be described in such order, and direct an entry to be made by the clerk
on the docket of such judgment that the same is " secured on appeal,"
except that in case only a specific portion of such property is exempted
from such lien, such order shall direct an entry to be made on such docket
that the same is " secured on appeal as per order of the court, dated —,"
specifying the date of such order ; and thereupon such judgment shall
cease during the pendency of such appeal to be a lien upon the property

tion, or in such other manner as the court shall direct. Such leave shall
not be given unless it be established by the oath of the party, or other sat
isfactory proof, that the judgment or some part thereof remains unsatisfied

the office of the clerk of the county, the application for leave to issue exe

plaintiff shall neglect to enter judgment in the action within one month
after it is in his power to do so, or shall neglect to issue execution against
the person of such defendant, within three months after the entry of judg
ment, such defendant may, on his motion, be discharged from custody by
the court in which such action shall have been commenced, unless good

against whom it was rendered, and the value of the property for which the
judgment was recovered to be specified therein ; if a delivery thereof can
not be had, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out
of the real property belonging to him on the day when the judgment was*

Until otherwise provided by the legislature, the existing provisions of
law not in conflict with this chapter, relating to executions, and their inci
dents, the property liable to sale on execution, the sale and redemption
thereof, the powers and rights of officers, their duties thereon, and the pro
ceedings to enforce those duties, and the liabilities of their sureties, shall
apply to the executions prescribed by this chapter


§ 292. [247.] (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1858, 1859, 1863, 1867.) When execution
returned unsatisfied, order for discovery of property allowed ; also when
judgment debtor refuses to apply property to satisfy judgment ; manner of
proceeding to examine judgment debtor.
When an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or any one
of sev.eral debtors in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff of the county

State, to the sheriff of the county where a judgment roll, or a transcript
of a justice's judgment for twenty-five dollars or upward, exclusive of costs,
is filed, is returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the judgment creditor,
at any time after such return made, is entitled to an order from a judge of
the court, or a county judge of the county to which the execution was
issued, or a judge of the court of common pleas for the city and county of
New York, when the execution was issued to such city and county, requiring
such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property before
such judge, at a time and place specified in the order, within the county to
which the execution was issued. But, in case of an order made by a justice
of the supreme court, all subsequent proceedings shall be had before .some
justice in the judicial district where the judgment debtor resides, to be
specified in the order. After the issuing of an execution against property,
and upon proof, by affidavit of a party, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of
the .court, or a judge thereof, or county judge, or any judge of the court
of common pleas for the city and county of New York, that any judgment
debtor, residing in the county where such judge or officer resides, has prop
erty which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judg
ment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor
to appear at a specified time and place, to answer concerning the samq : and
such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property
of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment as are pro
vided upon the return of an execution. Whenever it shall satisfactorily
appear, by affidavit, to a justice of the supreme court, that such county
judge, or jadge of said court of common pleas, is incapacitated from acting
in any of the proceedings whatever, herein authorized, from any cause or
causes whatsoever, such justice of the supreme court shall have the same
powers and authority, in all cases whatever, as are herein conferred upon
hhn as to cases of judgments in the supreme court. On an examination
under this section, either party may examine witnesses in his behalf, and the
judgment debtor may be examined in the same manner as a witness.
Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the
the judge may, upon proof, by affidavit or otherwise, to his satisfaction, that
there is danger of the debtor's leaving the State, or concealing himself, and
that there is reason to believe he has property which he unjustly refuses to
apply to such judgment, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county
where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such judge.
Upon being brought before the judge, he may be examined on oath, and if
it then appears that there is danger of the debtor's leaving the State, and
that he has property which he has unjustly refused to apply to such judg
ment, ordered to enter into an undertaking with one or more sureties, that
he will from time to time attend before the judge as he shall direct, and
that he will not, during the pendency of the proceedings, dispose of any
portion of his property, not exempt from execution. In default of enter
ing into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison by warrant of
the judge as for a contempt. No person shall, on examination pursuant to
this chapter, be excused from answering any question on the ground that
his examination will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud ; but
his answer shall not be used as evidence against him in any criminal pro
ceeding or prosecution. Nor shall he be excused from answering any ques
tion on the ground that he has, before the examination, executed any con
veyance, assignment or transfer of his property for any purpose, but his
answer shall not be used as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding
or prosecution.

§ 293. [248.] (Am'd 1849.) Any debtor may pay execution against his
(redilor.
After the issuing of execution against property, any person indebted
to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount of his debt, or
so much thereof as shall be necessary to satisfy the execution, and the sher
iff's receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid.

§ 294. [249.] (Am'd 1849, 1863.) Examination of debtors of judgment
debtor, or of those having properly belonging to him.
After the issuing or return of an execution against property of the
judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment,
and upon an affidavit that any person or corporation has property of such
judgment debtor, or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars,
the judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation or any
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place, and
answer concerning the same. The judge may also, in his discretion, require
notice of such proceeding to be given to any party to the action, in such
manner as may seem to him proper.
The proceedings mentioned in this section, and in section 292, may be
taken upon the return of an execution unsatisfied, issued upon a judgment
recovered in an action against joint debtors, in which some of the defend
ants have not been served with the summons by which said action was com
menced, so far as relates to the joint property of such debtors ; and all
•actions by creditors, to obtain satisfaction of judgments out of the property
of joint debtors, are maintainable in the like manner and to the like effect.
These provisions shall apply to all proceedings and actions now pending,
and not actually terminated by any final judgment or decree.

§ 295. [250.] Witness required to testify.
Witnesses may be required to appear and testify on any proceedings
under this chapter, in the same manner as upon the trial of an issue.
§ 296. [251.] (Am'd 1849.) Compelling party or witness to attend;
examination, when to be on oath.
The party or witness may be required to attend before the judge or
before a referee appointed by the court or judge ; if before a referee, the
examination shall be taken by the referee, and certified to the judge. All
examinations and answers before a judge or referee, under this chapter,
shall be on oath, except that when a corporation answers, the answer shall
be on the oath of an officer thereof.

execution.
The judge may order any property of the judgment debtor, not exempt
from execution, in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due
to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judg
ment, except that the earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at
any time within sixty days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied,
when it is made to appear by the debtor's affidavit, or otherwise, that such
earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly
by his labor.

judgment debtor, in the same manner, and with the like authority, as if
the appointment was made by the court according to section 244. But,
before the appointment of such receiver, the judge shall ascertain, if practicable,
by the oath of the party, or otherwise, whether any other supple
mentary proceedings are pending against the judgment debtor, and, if such
proceedings are so pending, the plaintiff therein shall have notice to appear
before him, and shall likewise have notice of all subsequent proceedings in
relation to said receivership. No more than one receiver of the property
of a judgment debtor shall be appointed. The judge may also, by order,
forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property of the judgment
debtor not exempt from execution, and any interference therewith.
Whenever the judge shall grant an order for the appointment of a re
ceiver of the property of the judgment debtor, the same shall be filed in
the office of the clerk of the county where the judgment roll in the action,
or transcript from justice's judgment, upon which the proceedings are
taken, is filed ; and the said clerk shall record the order in a book to be
kept for that purpose in his office, to be called " book of orders appointing
receivers of judgment debtors," and shall note the time of the filing of said
order therein. A certified copy of said order shall be delivered to the
receiver named therein, and he shall be vested with the property and effects
of the judgment debtor from the time of the filing and recording of the
order as aforesaid. The receiver of the judgment debtor shall be subject
to the direction and control of the court in which the judgment was
obtained, upon which the proceedings are founded ; or, if the judgment is
upon a transcript from justice's court filed in county clerk's office, then he
shall be subject to the direction and control of the county court.
But, before he shall be veslcd with any real property of such judgment
debtor, a certified copy of said ol der shall also be tiled and recorded in the
office of the clerk of the county in which any real estate of such judgment
debtor sought to be affected by such order is situated, and also in the office
of the clerk of the county in which such judgment debtor resides.

§ 299. [254.] (Am'd 1849.) Proceedings upon claim of another party to
property, or on denial of indebtedness to judgment debtor. "
If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have property of
the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property,
adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or debt shall be recovera
ble only in an action against such person or corporation by the receiver ;
but the judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such
property or interest, till a sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to
commence the action, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution ;
but such order may be modified or dissolved, by the judge granting the
same, at any time, on such security as he shall direct.

§ 300. [255. J (Am'd 1849, 1857.) Reference by judge. .
The judge may, in his discretion, order a reference to a referee, agreed
upon by the parties or appointed by him, to report the evidence or the
facts, and may, in his discretion, appoint such referee in the first order or

§ 301. [256.] (Am'd 1849.) Costs of proceedings.
The judge may allow to the judgment creditor, or to any party so
examined, whether a party to the action or not, witnesses' fees and dis
bursements! and a fixed sum in addition, not exceeding thirty dollars, as

§ 302. [257. j (Am'd 1849, 1851.) Disobedience of order, how punished.
If any person, party or witness disobey an order of the judge or referee
duly served, such person, party or witness may be punished by the judge
as for a contempt. And in all cases of commitment under this chapter, or
the act to abolish imprisonment for debt, the person committed may, in -case
of inability to perform the act required, or to endure the imprisonment, be
discharged from imprisonment, by the court or judge committing him, or
the court in which the judgment was rendered, on such terms as may be
just.

§ 303. [258.] Fee bill abolished ; allowances given, termed costs.
All statutes establishing or regulating the costs or fees of attorneys,
solicitors and counsel in civil actions, and all existing rules and provisions
of law, restricting or controlling the right of a party to agree with an
attorney, solicitor or counsel, for his compensation, are repealed ; and here
after the measure of such compensation shall be left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties. But there may be allowed to the pre

court or referee by whom the action is tried. When several actions shall
be brought on one bond, recognizance, promissory note, bill of exchange,
or other instrument in writing, or in any other case, for the same cause of
action, against several parties who might have been joined as defendants
in the same action, no costs other than disbursements shall be allowed to

Upon the hearing of the appeal, the appellate court shall give judgment

defects which do not affect the merits. In giving judgment, the court may
aflirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, and
as to any or all the parties, and for errors of law or fact. If the appeal is
founded on an error in fact in the proceedings, not affecting the merits of
the action, and not within the knowledge of the justice, the court may*
determine the alleged error in fact on affidavits, and may, in its discretion,
inquire into and determine the same upon the examination of the witnesses.
If the defendant failed to appear before the justice, and it is shown by the
affidavits served by the appellant, or otherwise, that manifest injustice has
been done, and he satisfactorily excuses his default, the court may, in its
discretion, set aside or suspend judgment, and order a new trial before the
same or any other justice in the same county, at such time and place, and
on such terms, as the court may deem proper. Where a new trial shall be
ordered before a justice, the parties must appear before him according to
the order of the court, and the same proceeding must thereupon be had in
the action as on the return of a summons personally served. If the appeal
shall be from a judgment in which a new trial may be had, as in this
chapter provided, the court shall proceed to the hearing of the cause, if
the issue joined before the justice was an issue of law, or to the trial
thereof by jury, if such issue was upon a question of fact :
1. If the issue joined before the justice was an issue of law, the court
shall render judgment thereon according to the law of the case ; and if
such judgment be against the pleadings of either party, an amendment of
such pleading may be allowed on the same terms and in like case as plead
ings in actions in the supreme court; and the court may thereupon, require
the opposite party to answer such amended pleading or join issue thereon,
as the case may require, summarily 
2. If upon an appeal in an issue of law, the court should adjudge the


pleading complained of to be valid, it .shall in like maimer require the op
posite party summarily to answer such pleading or join issue thereon, as
the case may require ;
3. Upon an issue of fact being so joined, the court shall proceed to
hear the same tried by a jury in the same maimer as issues joined in the
supreme court;
4. Every issue of fact so joined, or brought upon an appeal, shall be
tried in the same manner as in actions commenced in the supreme court ;
5. The court shall have the same power over its own determinations
and the verdict of the jury, and shall render judgment thereon in the same
manner as the supreme court in actions pending therein, and may allow
either party to amend his pleadings upon such terms as shall be just in
cases where a new trial may be had, as in this chapter provided ; and in
any such appeal, on which a new trial is to be had, either party may, at
any time before trial, serve upon the opposite party an offer, in writing, to
allow judgment to be taken against him for the sum or property, or to the
effect in such offer specified, and with or without costs, as said offer shall
specify. If the party receiving such offer accept the same, and give notice
thereof in writing within ten days, he may file the return and offer, with
an affidavit of service of notice of acceptance thereof, and the clerk shall
thereupon enter judgment according to said offer. And if the party mak
ing such offer shall have given an undertaking upon the appeal, the parties
executing such undertaking shall be liable thereon for the payment of the
judgment entered by virtue of said offer. If the notice of acceptance be
not given, the offer is to be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given in evi
dence. And, if the party to whom such offer is made fail to obtain a judg
ment more favorable to him than that specified in said offer, then he shall
not recover costs, but must pay the other party's costs from the date of the
service of the offer ;
6. Either party may move for a new trial in said court on a case or
exception, or otherwise, and such motion may be made before or after judg
ment has been entered, and the provisions of this act in relation to the pro
ceedings on receiving the verdict of a jury, exceptions to the decisions of
the court, making and settling ease and exceptions, motions for new trials,
and making up the judgment roll in the supreme court, are hereby made
applicable to all appeals brought up for trial as in this chapter provided.

§ 367. [318.] (Am'd 1852, 1865, 1869.) Judgment roll.
To every judgment on appeal there shall be annexed the return upon
which it was heard, or a certified copy thereof, the notice of appeal, with
any offer, verdict, decision of the court, exceptions, case, and all orders and
papers in any way involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judg
ment, which shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and shall constitute

§ 369. [322. J (Am'd 1849, 1857.) Ordering restitution.
If the judgment below, or any part thereof, be paid or collected, ami
the judgment be afterwards reversed, the appellate court shall order the
amount paid or collected to be restored, with interest from the time of
such payment or collection. The order may be obtained on proof of the
facts made at or after the hearing, upon a previous notice of six days, and
if the order shall be made before the judgment is entered, the. amount may
be included in the judgment.

§ 370. [323.] Setting of costs and recovery.
If, upon an appeal, a recovery be had by one party, and cost* be
awarded to the other, the appellate court shall set off the one against the
other, and render judgment for the balance.

§ 371. [324. J (Am'd 1849, 1851, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1866.) The costs on appeal.
Costs shall lie allowed to the prevailing party in judgments rendered
on appeal in all cases, with the following exceptions and limitations : In the
notice of appeal, the appellant shall state in what particular or particulars
ne claims the judgment should have been more favorable to him. If he
claims that the amount of judgment is less favorable to him than it should
have been, he shall state what should have been its amount. Within fifteen
days after the service of the notice of appeal, the respondent may serve
upon the appellant and justice an offer, in writing, to allow the judgment
to be corrected in any of the particulars mentioned in the notice of appeal.
The appellant may, thereupon, and within five days thereafter, file with the
justice a written acceptance of such offer, who shall thereupon make a
minute thereof, in his docket, and correct such judgment accordingly, and
the same so corrected shall stand as his judgment, and be enforced accord
ingly ; and any execution which has been issued upon the judgment
appealed from, shall be amended by the justice to correspond with the
amended judgment ; and no undertaking given to stay execution shall be
enforced for more than the amount of the corrected judgment. If such
offer be not made, and the judgment in the appellate court be more favor
able to the appellant than the judgment in the court below ; or if such offer
be made and not accepted, and the judgment in the appellate court bo
more favorable to the appellant than the offer of the respondent, the appel
lant shall recover costs; provided, however, that the appellant shall not
recover costs unless the judgment appealed from shall be reversed on such
appeal, or be made more favorable' to him, to the amount of at least ten
dollars. If the offer be made, and accepted by the appellant, the appellant
shall recover all his disbursements on appeal, and all his costs in the court
below. But the appellant shall not recover costs except as provided in
this chapter. The respondent shall be entitled to recover costs where the
appellant is not.
Whenever costs are awarded to the appellant, he shall be allowed to
tax as part thereof the costs and fees paid to the justice on making the
appeal, as disbursements, in addition to the costs in the appellate court ;
and when the judgment in the suit before the justice was against such
appellant, he shall further be allowed to tax the costs incurred by him,
which he would have been entitled to recover in case the judgment below
had been rendered in his favor. If, upon an appeal, a recovery for any
debt or damages be had by one party, and costs be awarded to the other
party, the court shall set off such costs against such debt or damages, and
render judgment for the balance. The following fees and costs, and no
other, except fees of officers, disbursements and witnesses' fees, shall be
allowed on appeal, to the party entitled to costs as herein provided, when
the new trial is in the county court.
For proceedings before notice of trial, ten dollars ; for all subsequent
proceedings before trial, seven dollars ; for trial of an issue of law, ten
dollars ; for every trial of an issue of fact, fifteen dollars ; for argument of
a motion for a new trial on a ease or a bill of exceptions, ten dollars ; in
all cases, to either party, for every term not exceeding five, at which the
appeal is necessarily on the calendar, and is not tried or is not postponed
by the court, seven dollars. In other appeals the costs shall be as
follows : To the appellant, on reversal, fifteen dollars ; to the respondent,
on the affirmance, twelve dollars. If the judgment appealed from be
reversed in part and affirmed as to the residue, the amount of costs allowed
to either party shall be such sum as the appellate court may award, not
exceeding ten dollars. If the appeal be dismissed for want of prosecution,
as provided by section 3(54, no costs shall be allowed to either party. In
every appeal the justice of the peace before whom the judgment appealed
from was rendered shall receive two dollars for his return. If the judg
ment be reversed for an error of fact in the proceedings, not affecting the
merits, costs shall be in the discretion of the court. If, in the notice of
appeal, the appellant shall not state in what particular or particulars he
claims the judgment should have been more favorable to him, he shall not
be entitled to costs unless the judgment appealed from shall be wholly
reversed.
