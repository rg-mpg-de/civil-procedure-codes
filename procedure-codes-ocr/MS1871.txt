or writ of error, the party moving for such dismissal, producing a
copy of the citation properly served, or a certificate of the clerk belowj

sufficient matter of substance to reveal the actual cause of complaint,
and enable the court to proceecf on the merits of the case, and which
also states, in common and intelligible language, the form of action

county where the suit is brought, and of the court where the suit is

with his declaration, when process issues ; in default of which, plain

laid, and cannot be found, and is sued on as a lost instrument.

be stated in the conclusion of a declaration, nor that mere formal
damages shall be laid ; but the declaration shall state the amount
really claimed, as nearly as may be, or the judgment to which the
party conceives himself entitled, and which he demands in the action.
§ 5S3. In actions of trespass, quare clausum fregit, the close or
place upon which the alleged trespass is charged to have occurred,

dition precedent, the performance of which he intends to contest.
§ 586. In pleading a judgment, or other determination of a court,

to it by its title, and the date of its passage.

the words or matter complained of, were used in a defamatory sense,
specifying such defamatory sense, without any prefatory averment, to
show how such words or matter were used in that sense ; and -such
averment shall be put in issue, by the denial of the alleged libel or
slander; and where the words or matter set forth, with or without the
alleged meaning, show a cause of action, the declaration shall be
sufficient.

is made, or ought to be made, in any pleading, shall be filed with such
pleading, in default of which no evidence thereof shall be given at
the trial.

pleading, established by the common law.

think fit.

be allowed to be proved at the trial ; and the defendant may, in all

plaintiff shall, before the trial of the cause, file a written notice to
the defendant of any special matter which he intends to give in evi

plaintiff and defendant, the defendant may plead payment, and may
prove and set-off against the demand of the plaintiff, any debt, or
demand, which he may have against the plaintiff ; and if it shall

plaintiff, the jury shall find for the defendant, and judgment shall be
entered that the plaintiff take nothing by his writ, and shall pay the
costs. And if it appear that any part of the sum demanded, has been
paid, but that the plaintiffs' demand exceeds that of the defendant,
the amount paid shall be deducted, and the plaintiff shall have judg

it appear to the jury that the plaintiff is overpaid, and is indebted to

alleged to be due by the defendant to the plaintiff, it shall be lawful
for the defendant to plead payment of the money demanded, at or
after the time when the same became due, or at any time before
action brought ; and under such plea, to prove any payments that
have been made, in part or in full of the sum demanded.
§ 604. If the defendant shall plead, or give notice of any set-off,
or shall desire to prove any payment, or set-off, under his plea of
payment, he shall file with his plea, an account, stating distinctly the
nature of the payment or set-off, and the several items thereof, and
a copy of any writing intended to be set-off; and on failure to do so,
he shall not be entitled to prove, on the trial, such payment or set-off.

plaintiff in such action shall recover more damages than the amount
so tendered, he shall be adjudged to pay the costs of the action.
,§ 608. The plaintiff in any action, may, by leave of the court or
judge, plead in answer to the plea, or subsequent pleading of the
defendant, as many several matters as he shall think necessary to
maintain his action ; and the defendant may, by like leave, plead in
answer to any pleading of the plaintiff, subsequent to the declaration,
as many several matters as he may think necessary to his defense,
upon the affidavit of the party making such application, that he is
advised and believes, that he has just ground to traverse the several
matters proposed to be traversed by him, or that the several matters
sought to be pleaded, by way of confession and avoidance, are respec
tively true, in substance and fact.
§ 609. Whenever any pleading concludes to the country, issue shall
be considered as joined thereon, unless a demurrer be filed thereto.
§ 610. When any p^ea in abatement shall be adjudged insuffi
cient, the plaintiff shall recover full costs, to the time of overruling
the plea; and when, by an interlocutory judgment, any other part of
the pleading shall be adjudged insufficient, all costs occasioned by

[CHAP. 8.

such bad pleading, shall be adjudged against him who committed the
fault.
§ 611. AVhen a demurrer shall be put in, the court shall not regard
any defect or imperfection in the proceedings, except such as shall be
assigned for causes of demurrer, unless something so essential to the
action or defense, as that judgment, according to law and the right
of the cause cannot be given, shall be omitted.
§ 612. If the demurrer of the defendant to the declaration, be
overruled, the court shall proceed to give judgment for the plaintiff,
for the amount due, and interest ; and no plea shall be admitted,
unless the defendant make oath that he hath a good and substantial
defense, setting forth fully the nature of such defense, that the court
may judge whether the plea ought to be admitted or not.
§ 613. If the plaintiff demur to the plea of the defendant, and the
demurrer be sustained, the judgment shall be, that the defendant do
answer over to the declaration ; but he shall be compelled to plead
to the merits, and the plaintiff shall not be delayed of his trial,

second plea then filed be demurred to, and such demurrer shall
be sustained, further leave to plead shall not be granted.

uncertain, that the precise nature of the charge or defense is not
apparent, or if any pleading shall be so framed as to prejudice,
embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action, the court, on applica
tion of the opposite party, shall cause the same to be made definite
and certain, or may strike out or amend the same.
§ 619. Irrelevant or redundant matter, inserted in a pleading, may
be struck out, on motion of any party aggrieved thereby.

where they are required, for the right understanding of allegations
that are material.
§ 621. The court shall have full power and authority to allow all
amendments to be made in any pleading, or proceeding, at any time
before verdict, so as to bring the merits of the controversy between the
parties, fairly to trial, and may allow all errors and mistakes, in the name
of any party, or in the form of the action, to be corrected ; and the
court shall require all such amendments to be made on such terms, as
to costs and delay, as may seem proper, to prevent surprise or undue

ing or refusing amendments, and the same may be assigned for error.
§ 622. No judgment shall be stayed, or reversed, after verdict, for
any defect in the writ ; or from a variance in the writ from the decla
ration, or other proceedings ; or from any mispleading, insufficient
pleading, discontinuance, misjoining of issue, or failure to join issue,
or lack of warrant of attorney ; or for the appearance of either party,
being under the age of twenty-one years, by attorney, if the verdict
be for him, and not to his prejudice; or for not alleging any deed, let
ters testamentary, or of administration, to be brought into court ; or
for the omission of the words " with force and arms," or " against the
peace ;" or for any mistake of the christian name, or surname, of
either party, sum of money, quantity of merchandise, value, day,
month, or year, in the declaration, or pleading (the name, sum, quan
tity, value, or time, being right in any other part of the record, or
proceeding) ; or for the omission of the averment, " this he is ready
to verify," or " this he is ready to verify by the record ;" or for not
alleging " as appeareth by the record ; " or for omitting the
averment of any matter without proving which the jury ought not
to have given such verdict; or for setting forth, by way of recital,
any matter which ought to have been set forth by averment ; or for
not alleging that the suit or matter is within the jurisdiction of the
court ; or for not alleging that the property in the declaration men
tioned, is the property of the plaintiff ; or for any mistake or miscon
ception of the form of the action ; or for any other defect whatsoever,
in the declaration or pleading, whether of form, or substance, which
might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, and which shall
not have been so taken advantage of ; or for any informality in enter
ing up the judgment, by the clerk; neither shall any judgment,
entered by default, be reversed, nor a judgment, after inquiry of
damages, be stayed or reversed, for any omission, or fault, which
would not have been good cause to stay or reverse the judgment, if
there had been a verdict on issue joined.
§ 623. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proof, shall be deemed material, unless it shall have actually misled
the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense
upon the merits ; and where it shall not be shown, to the satisfaction
of the court, that the party has been so misled, an immediate amend
ment of the pleading may be made without costs, and without delay
ing the cause. If the party has been so actually misled, an amend
ment may be allowed, on such terms as shall be just.
§ 624. When there are several counts, one of which is faulty, and
entire damages are given, the verdict shall be good ; but the defend
ant may apply to the gourt to instruct the jury to disregard the faulty
count.
§ 625. If in detinue the verdict shall omit price or value, the court
may, at any time, award a writ of inquiry to ascertain the same. If,

dict be found for part of them, it shall not be error, but the plain
tiff shall be barred of his title to the things omitted.
§ 626. A judgment by confession shall be equal to a release of
errors; but all powers of attorney for confessing or suffering judg
ment to pass by default, or otherwise, and all general releases of error
made, or to be made, by any person within this state, before action
brought, shall be absolutely null and void.
§ 627. When, in the record of any judgment or decree of any court
of law or equity, there shall be any mistake, miscalculation, or misrecital of any sum of money, quantity of merchandise, or other thing,
or of any name, and there shall be among the records of the proceed
ings in the suit, in which such judgment or decree shall be rendered,
any verdict, bond, bill, note, or other writing of the like nature or
kind, whereby such judgment or decree may be safely amended, it
shall be the duty of the court in which such judgment shall be ren
dered, and of the judge thereof, in vacation, to amend such judgment
or decree thereby, according to the very truth and justice of the case ;
provided, the opposite party shall have had reasonable notice of the
application for such amendment ; and if the transcript of such judg
ment or decree, at the time of such amendment, or at any time there
after, shall be removed to the supreme court, it shall be the duty of
that court, upon the inspection of such amended record, (to be brought
before it by certiorari, if need be), to affirm such judgment, if there
be no other error apparent on such record.
§ 628. When any bond, taken by virtue of any process or order, by
miscalculation or mistake, shall be conditioned for the payment of a
larger sum of money than by law ought to have been required thereby,
or where a verdict shall be rendered for more damages than the plainthT shall have demanded by his suit, and judgment shall be rendered
accordingly, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff, at the same or any
future term of the court, to release, in open court, any such excess ;
or he may, in vacation, release the same, in writing under his hand,
and filed among the papers of the cause ; and such release shall cure
any error growing out of such excess.
§ 629. If the record of any such judgment be removed to an
appellate court, before such release shall be made, it shall be compe
tent for the defendant in error to make such release, as aforesaid, in
the appellate court; and, thereupon, the said court, after reversing
the judgment, shall proceed to give such judgment as the court below
ought to have given, if the release had been filed therein ; but, in
such cases, the appellee, or defendant in error, shall pay the costs,
and the judgment shall not be entered against the sureties in the
appeal bond.
§ 630. All things in this article contained, not restricted by their
nature, or by express provision to particular courts, shall be the rules
of decision and proceeding in all courts whatsoever within this state.

part of the record in the cause; and in case the judge shall refuse to
sign a bill of exceptions so tendered, if the facts therein be truly

deceased party or not.
§ 67S. If any suit shall be commenced in the name of any person,

ing the suit, if the cause of action survives to the husband, her death
shall be suggested on the record, and the cause shall proceed in the
name of the husband ; and if the cause of action shall not survive to
the husband, but to the representatives of the wife, then, on sugges
tion of the death of the wife, the suit shall abate as to the husband,

may be applicable, in all cases where any writing is pleaded or set up
by the defendant, or any signature, identity or names of persons,
description of character, or partnership set forth in his pleading.

[Chap. 8.

served upon individuals by the officer to whom the process is directed,
in one of the following modes: 1st. Upon the defendant, personally,
if to be found in the county, by handing him a true copy of the pro
cess. 2d. If the defendant cannot be found in the county, then by
leaving a true copy of the process at his usual place of abode, with his
wife, or some other person above the age of sixteen years, being one
of his family, and willing to receive such copy. 3d. If the defendant
cannot himself be found, and if no person of his family, aged six
teen years, can be found at his usual place of abode, who is willing to
receive 'such copy, then by posting such true copy on a door of the
defendant's usual place of abode.
§ 702. If the sheriff, or other officer, to whom the original process
is addressed, shall execute the same in the mode first stated in the
preceding section, his return shall be made substantially as follows :
"Executed the within process this day upon the defendant in person,
by handing to him a true copy thereof." If the process be executed in
the manner secondly above authorized, the return shall be substantially
as follows : " Executed this process this day, by handing to the wife
of the defendant (or to A B, a person of his family, of the age of
sixteen years, as the case may be), at his usual place of abode in said
county, such person being then and there willing to receive the same,
a true copy of this process, said defendant not being found in my
county, after diligent search." If the process be executed in the man
ner thirdly prescribed, in the preceding section, the return shall be
substantially in the form following: "The within named defendant, A
B, after diligent search, cannot be found in my county, nor could I
find, after dilgent search, any person of his family, of the age of six
teen years, at his usual place of abode, who was willing to receive a
copy of this process. I therefore executed the same this day, by
posting a true copy thereof on the door of the defendant's usual place
of abode, in my county." The returns, however made, shall be dated
with the day of service, and signed by the officer serving the process.
§ 703. If the defendant be a corporation, process may be served
on the president, or other head of the corporation, upon the cashier,

be found in the county, then it shall be sufficient to post a true copy
of the process on the door of the office, or principal place of business
of the corporation. In suits against railroad and telegraph compa
nies, brought in any county, other than that in which their office, or

station agent, or sent to any county in which such office, or principal
place of business may be located, and there served, as herein directed

tentiary, shall be sufficient.
§ 707. The officer serving process, shall not be permitted to ques
tion the truth of his return ; but either of the parties to the action
may, in the same action, show the return to be untrue.
§ 708. On motion of either party, and a suggestion that the officer
serving process has, either by mistake or omission, made a defective
return of his proceedings, the return may be amended, but only
according to the facts connected with the service.

of the person for whose use the action is brought; and if costs are
given against the plaintiff in such action, such usee shall alone be
answerable therefor, and execution may issue against him, as in other
cases against the plaintiff.
§ 711. Any process, appearing to be in other respects duly served,
shall be deemed good, though not directed to any officer.
§ 712. If any matter required to be inserted in, or endorsed on

may be made upon any application to set aside or quash the writ.
§ 713. When the sheriff shall return that he has been kept off by

1 hereof, other process shall be issued, the sheriff shall not execute
such subsequent process, but shall return the first process by him
executed, if it be in his possession, and if it be not in his possession,
he shall return the subsequent process, with an endorsement of the
execution of such first process ; on which there shall be the same pro
ceedings as if the said first process had been duly returned.
§ 715. Writs of scire facias, for the renewal of judgments, and
for reviving suits, may be issued to any county in the state, and shall

§ 716. In actions upon penal statutes by an informer, the title of
the statute upon which the action is founded, shall be endorsed upon

thereof by such sheriff or other officer, unless he shall make oath
that he did not himself receive it, and that he verily believes it was
not received by any of his deputies.
§ 718. When the defendant shall not be found, the plaintiff may
sue out an alias or pluries summons, until the defendant shall be

defendant, after the commencement of suit, shall have gone into

CHANGE OF VENUE.
§ 719. When either party to a civil action in the circuit court shall
desire to change the venue, he shall present to the court, or to the
judge of the district in vacation, a petition setting forth, under oath,
that he has good reason to believe that from the undue influence of
the adverse party, prejudice existing in the public mind, or for some
other sufficient cause, to be described in said petition, he could not
obtain a fair and impartial trial in the county where the action
may be pending, and that the application is made as soon as could
conveniently be, after being advised of such undue influence, preju
dice, or other cause, as aforesaid, and not to delay the trial, or to vex
or harrass the adverse party ; and on reasonable notice, in writing, to
the adverse party, of the time and place of making the application,
if made in vacation, the court, if in term time, or the judge in vaca
tion, shall hear the parties, and examine the evidence which either

party may adduce, and may award a change of venue to some con
venient county, where an impartial trial may be had, and if practica
ble, in which a circuit court may next be held ; and if made in vaca
tion the order shall be endorsed on the petition, and directed to the
clerk, who shall file the same with the papers in the suit.
§ 720. When any order for a change of venue shall be made, as
aforesaid, the clerk shall make out a descriptive list of all the papers
in the cause, and a certified copy of all orders made therein, with
their dates, and a bill of the costs that have accrued, and shall care

court to which the suit may be removed, and shall, (if not otherwise
ordered by the judge), take the receipt of the party obtaining the
change of venue, for the papers contained in said list, and deliver the
package to said party, to be carried to the clerk of the court to whom
it may be directed. But the court or judge may direct, in said order,
that the party applying, previously to a removal of the papers, shall
pay to the clerk the sum of five dollars for every twenty miles of dis
tance from the place where the suit is pending, to that to which it is
ordered to be removed ; and it shall be the duty of the clerk, on the
payment of said sum of money, to carry the papers, or employ some
trustworthy person to carry them to the clerk of the court to whom
they may be directed, and all costs that have accrued in the cause,
shall abide its final termination, as in other cases.
§ 721 The clerk to whom the papers may be transmitted shall open the
seal of the package and compare the papers with the descriptive list,
and shall give to the party or person delivering the same a receipt
therefor ; he shall then enter the cause on his docket as if it had been
commenced in the court of which he is clerk, and issue subpoenas for
witnesses as in other cases, and proceed with the case as if it had orig
inated in his court.
§ 722. No civil suit shall be removed more than once, or in any
other manner than that prescribed in this act, and in no case where it
shall appear that there has been any unnecessary delay or negligence
of the party in making such application : provided, That nothing here
in contained shall apply to the removal of suits commenced out of the
county of the residence and freehold of the defendant.
§ 723. The provisions of this article shall be applied to a change of
venue from one district to another, in those counties where there are
two circuit court districts.

his appearance, and in what sum, and whether with or without sure
ties, which recognizance or bond the sheriff or other officer by whom
the attachment is executed is authorized to take, payable to the
State. And in case said witness shall appear in answer to said at
tachment, the court may discharge him therefrom, on good cause
shown, or may require him to enter into like recognizance for his ap
pearance, from day to day, and from term to term, until discharged, to
testify in said cause. In case said witness shall not appear in pursu

as upon the forfeiture of a recognizance in a criminal case.
§ 766. Any person summoned as a witness, and not appearing and
attending as required by this act, shall be fined by the court in any

then no fine shall be incurred by such failure.
§ 767. Witnesses in criminal cases shall be liable to the same pro

to appear and attend, as in civil cases. The court may cause the wit
nesses on either side to be bound by recognizance to appear and tes
tify until discharged.
§ 7 68. The number of days, and the amount of mileage, tolls, and
ferriages, shall be determined by the oath of the witness, to be ad
ministered by the clerk of the court, who shall give the witness a cer
tificate thereof; and if any witness shall swear falsely, to obtain such
certificate, he shall be deemed guilty of perjury and punished accord
ingly. Each witness in a civil case shall be entitled to demand, at the

compensation as a witness, nor shall any person be allowed for his at
tendance as a witness in more than one criminal case on the same
day.
§ 772. The compensation of witnesses on behalf of the State, shall
be allowed in open court, and the order therefor entered upon the
minutes, and a certified copy made out by the clerk and delivered to
the party entitled thereto ; and the amount shall be taxed in the costs,

or the prosecutor be taxed with the costs.
§ 773. If, on conviction, the defendant shall be unable to pay the
costs, or, if he be acquitted, and the costs be not taxed on the prose
cutor, or, if the prosecutor, being so taxed, shall be unable to pay
said costs, the compensation of witnesses on behalf of the State shall
be paid out of the state treasury ; and, on presentation of a certified
copy of the order of allowance of such compensation, and a certificate
of the clerk, in cases where the defendant has been convicted or
the prosecutor taxed with the cost, that execution has been issued and
returned nulla bona, or that the defendant has been discharged as an
insolvent debtor, the auditor shall issue his warrant for the amount

term, or within five days thereafter, prove his attendance and obtain
a certificate, in the manner directed by this act.
§ 776. Any witness being conscientiously scrupulous of taking an
oath, may give testimony upon his solemn affirmation, which shall be
as good and effectual as an oath ; and the person so deposing shall
be guilty of perjury, and liable to all the penalties thereof, in all
cases where he would be guilty of perjury, if he had testified upon oath ;
and it shall be sufficient to charge in the indictment that such a per
son was sworn, or testified upon oath, and it shall not be a variance if
it appear that he was affirmed. The form of affirmation shall be in
substance as follows, to- wit : " You do solemnly and truly declare and
affirm,*' etc. In all cases where an oath or affidavit is required by
law, it shall be sufficient, if the same be made or given on the solemn
affirmation of the party.
§ 777. If any person summoned as a witness shall refuse to be
sworn or affirmed, or to give evidence, he shall be committed to
prison by the court, commissioner, referees, or other person author

cause, or his conviction of any crime, and his answers may be con
tradicted, and his interest or his conviction of a cringe established by
other evidence ; and no witness shall be excused from answering any
question, material and relevant, unless the answer would expose him to a
criminal prosecution or penalty, or a forfeiture of his estate ; and the
court shall decide as to the effect of such evidence, after privately
hearing the witness.

count in any court of this State having jurisdiction of the amount,
may go before any justice of the peace of this State, or any other
State, or the United States, authorized by law to administer oaths,,
and make affidavit to the correctness of such account, and that it is
due from the party against whom it is charged; and in any suit upon
such an account thus sworn to, the affidavit of the plaintiff, or party
in whose favor the account is stated, or his agent, made as aforesaid,
and attached to the account, shall be prima facie evidence of the
correctness of the account and indebtedness of the defendant against
whom the sum is charged, and shall entitle the plaintiff to judgment
at the trial term of the suit, unless the defendant shall make affidavit
and file with his plea, that the account is not correct, in which event
the affidavit to the account shall not be evidence, except to entitle
the plaintiff to judgment, for such part of said account as the defend

or administrators.

for the penalty of such bond, to be discharged by the payment of the
principal and interest due thereon, and the costs .of suit, and execu
tion shall issue accordingly; or if, before judgment, the defendant
shall bring into court the principal and interest due upon such bond,
he shall be discharged, and in that case judgment shall be entered
for the costs only.
§ 825. In all civil actions, the party in whose favor judgment shall
be given, or in case of non-suit, dismission, or discontinuance, the de

dressed as to such costs so wrongfully awarded, in case the same be
levied upon him ; and where several persons shall be made de
fendants in any action of trespass, assault, false imprisonment, or
ejectment, and upon trial thereof, any one or more of them shall be
acquitted by verdict, every defendant so acquitted shall recover his
costs of suit, in like manner as if a verdict had been given against the
plaintiff or plaintiffs, as to all the defendants, unless the court before
whom such cause shall be tried shall be satisfied that there was reas
onable cause for making such person or persons defendant or defend
ants to such action, and shall order it otherwise.

term, on the motion of the plaintiff, the court shall render judgment
thereon, for the amount acknowledged to be due, with interest from

may be stipulated; and such judgment shall be final, unless set aside
during the term, and shall be as binding and obligatory as judgments
rendered in any other form, and a full and complete final record shall
be made thereof, as in other cases.
§ 829. The clerks of the several circuit courts shall procure and keep
in their respective offices, one or more books, to be styled " the
Judgment Roll" of said court, which books shall be appropriately
divided under the several letters of the alphabet, and on each page,

And the said clerk shall, within ten days after the adjournment of

of the alphabet, the names of each and every defendant to said judg
ment or decree, the amount of such judgment or decree, the date

judgment shall be a lien on any property of the defendant or de
fendants thereto, unless the same shall be enrolled in the manner
herein directed. But the priority of lien provided for in this section,
shall not extend to judgment creditors, who fail, refuse or neglect to
sue out execution for the satisfaction of his, her or their judgment or
judgments, until a junior judgment creditor has, by due diligence,
caused his execution to be levied upon the property of the defend
ant; but in all such cases, the sale by the sheriff or other officer shall
vest the title of the defendant or defendants in the purchaser, and
the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the satisfaction of the
junior judgment creditor : provided, that before said junior creditor
shall cause a levy to be made, he shall give notice to older creditors
in execution, that unless they proceed in ten days to levy, he will
proceed ; and in that case, he shall have a preference under his levy.
§ 831. The purchaser or purchasers of any property sold at execu
tion sale by the sheriff or other officer, shall take the same discharged
of all liens of judgment and decrees, whether the same be sold under
an execution issued upon the elder or junior judgment or decree.
§ 832. After the sale of any property by the sheriff or other officer
on execution, before the money is paid over by him, he shall examine
the "Judgment Roll," to ascertain if there be any elder judgment or
judgments, decree or decrees, enrolled against the defendant or defend
ants in said execution, having a priority of lien ; and if there be, he
shall apply the proceeds of such sale to such elder judgment or decree,
so having priority of lien, and return such application upon the execu
tion on which such sale shall have been made. But should there be
any dispute as to which judgment or decree has the priority of lien,
then such officer shall make a statement of the fact of such dispute,
and return the same, with the execution and the money raised thereon,
into the court to which the same is returnable, and the court shall, on
motion and examination of the facts, determine to whom the money
so raised on execution shall be paid.
§ 833. No judgment or decree rendered in any court of the United
States, or of this state, shall be a lien upon or bind any property of
the defendants, situate out of the county in which such judgment or
decree was rendered, until the plaintiff shall file, in the office of the
clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the property may be
situated, an abstract of such judgment or decree, certified by the clerk
of the court in which the same was rendered, containing the names of
all the parties to such judgment or decree, its amount, and the date
of the rendition, and the amount appearing to have been paid thereon,
if any ; and it shall be the duty of the clerk of any circuit court, on
receiving such abstract, and on payment of the fees allowed by law
for filing, recording and enrolling the same, to file the same and record
it in a separate book, plainly indexed, to be kept for that purpose,
and to note therein the day on which such abstract was filed for record
as aforesaid, and he shall forthwith enroll the same on the "Judgment

Roll," as in other cases ; and such judgment or decree shall, from the
date of its enrollment as aforesaid, be a lien upon and bind the prop
erty of the defendants within the county where it shall be so enrolled.
§ 834. Judgments and decrees in law or in equity, rendered in any
court of the United States, held within this state, or in the supreme
court, or the chancery court, shall not be a lien upon or bind the
property of the defendants within the county in which such judgments
or decrees may be rendered, until an abstract thereof shall be filed
and recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county,
and enrolled on the "Judgment Roll," in the manner and on the terms
hereinbefore provided ; and such judgments and decrees shall bind
the proj»erty of the defendants, from the date of such enrollment, in
like manner as judgments and decrees rendered in a different county,
and so enrolled.
§ 835. A copy of the entry on the " Judgment Roll," with the
caption at the top of the page on which such entry is made, certified
by the clerk under the seal of the court, shall be competent evidence
of such enrollment.
§ 836. Judgments rendered by justices of the peace in this state,
are subject to the same rules and requirements as to enrollment as
are prescribed in this article in reference to other judgments.

ARTICLE XV.
EXECUTIONS—HOW ISSUED AND PROCEEDED WITH.
§ 837. The clerks of all courts of law and equity in this state, un
less otherwise ordered by the plaintiff, shall, within twenty days alter
the adjournment of the court for the term, issue executions on all
judgments and decrees rendered therein, and place the same in the
hands of the sheriff of the county; and. if requested by the plaintiff,
they shall issue executions directed to the sheriff of any other county,
and shall deliver the same to the plaintiff or his attorney ; but no exe
cution shall issue on any judgment entered with a stay of execution,
until such stay shall have expired.
§ 838. Executions may issue at any time within a year and a day
after the rendition of the judgment or decree, or within a year and
a day after the expiration of the stay of execution ordered by the
court ; and in case the issuance of execution has been prevented by
injunction or supersedeas, then execution may be issued within a year
and a day after the dissolution of such injunction, or the discharge or
expiration of such supersedeas.
§ 839. Writs of execution, from the circuit court, shall bear date
and be issued in the same manner as original process, and shall be
made returnable on the first day of the next term of the court in

Chap. 8.]

EXECUTIONS—HOW ISSUED.

173

which the judgment or decree was rendered : provided, there be at
least thirty days between the issuance and return thereof; and in case
there shall not be thirty days between the issuance of such execution,
and the first day of the next term, the same shall be made returna
ble on the first day of the next term thereafter ; and such execution
may be directed to the sheriff or other proper officer of any county in
the state, who shall serve and execute the same, and make return
thereof to the court in which the judgment or decree was rendered.
§ 840. If any party at whose suit execution has issued, shall desire
to take out another execution, the clerk may issue the same at the
cost of such party, if the first writ has not been returned and has not
been executed ; and when one judgment has been recovered against
several defendants, execution shall issue thereon as if it were against
one defendant, and not otherwise ; and if one or more of several de
fendants shall have died before the issuance of such writ, and no re
vivor has been had, the fact of the death shall be noted on the writ,
and the property of the survivors only shall, in such cases, be liable to
the execution.
§ 841. Writs of execution, where there is no judgment lien, shall
bind the property of the defendant only from the time of the delivery
thereof to the officer to be executed ; and if two or more such writs
shall be delivered against the same person on the same day, that
which was first delivered shall be first satisfied. Such executions
shall only bind such property as shall be actually levied upon by the
officer, on or before the return day thereof, and of which a written de
scription shall be endorsed on or returned with such execution ; and it
shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer, on the receipt of any
execution, to endorse thereon the day of the month and the year, and
if necessary, the hour, when he received the same ; and for any failure
to make such endorsement, the sheriff or other officer shall be liable
to a penalty of one hundred dollars, to the use of the plaintiff, recov
erable by motion before the court from which the execution issued,
after five days' notice, and shall moreover be liable for all damages
sustained by any party aggrieved.
§ 842. Land shall not be levied on, if sufficient personal property
be found or surrendered by the debtor.
§ 843. When any sheriff or other officer shall serve an execution on
horses or other live stock, he shall provide sufficient sustenance for
the support of such live stock, until sold or otherwise legally dis
charged from such execution ; and upon the return of the execution,
the court, in cases where the compensation is not fixed by law, shall
settle and adjust what such officer shall be allowed for his expenses
incurred for supporting such stock ; and such officer shall be allowed
to retain the same out of the money arising from the sale of such
stock.
§ 844. If any sheriff or officer shall levy, or shall be about to levy,
an execution or attachment on any personal property, and doubt shall

EXECUTIONS—HOW ISSUED.

[Chap. 8.

arise whether the right to such property is in the defendant or not,
such sheriff or officer may demand of the plaintiff a bond, signed by
good and responsible persons, payable to such sheriff or officer, in a
sufficient penalty, conditioned that the obligors therein will indemnify
and save harmless the said sheriff or officer against all damages which
he may sustain, in consequence of the seizure or sale of the property
on which the execution or attachment shall be, or shall have been
levied, and, moreover, will pay and satisfy to any person claiming
title to said property, all damages which said person may sustain in
consequence of such seizure or sale ; and if the plaintiff shall fail to
give such bond, the sheriff or officer shall be justifiable in refusing to
levy on such property, or, if the levy be made, and such bond be not
given, on or before the day of sale, or the return-day of the process,
the officer shall be justifiable in releasing the levy, and delivering
the property to the party from whose possession it was taken : pro
vided., the plaintiff, or his agent or attorney, had reasonable notice in
writing, before the day of sale or return-day of the process, that such
bond would be required.
§ 845. If such bond and security be given, it shall be returned
with the execution or attachment, and any person claiming the prop-,
erty levied on, may prosecute a suit upon the bond, in the name of
the payee, or his representatives, for the use of such claimant, and
recover such damages as he may sustain by the seizure or sale of
said property, or levy of said process, whether the same shall exceed
the penalty of such bond or not ; and such claimant shall, after the
due execution of such bond, be barred of any action against the sheriff
or officer levying such execution, unless the obligors in said bond
shall be, or become insolvent, or the bond be otherwise invalid.
§ 846. All sales by any sheriff or other officer, by virtue of any
execution or other process, shall be made at the court house of the
county, except when personal property, too cumbersome to be re
moved, shall be levied on, which may be sold at the place where the
same may be found, or at any other convenient place, and also, except
where cattle, hogs, sheep, or stock, other than horses and mules, are
levied on, the sale of which may be made within the usual hours, on
ten days' notice, at the most public place in the neighborhood of the
defendant ; and such sales may be made on the first Monday of every
month, or on the first Monday or Tuesday of each term of the circuit
court of the county, and shall not commence sooner than eleven o'clock
in the forenoon, nor continue later than four o'clock in the afternoon.
Sales of lands shall be advertised in a newspaper published in the
county, once in each week, for three successive weeks ; and, if there
be no such newspaper, or if the publisher thereof shall refuse to pub
lish such advertisement, then such notice shall be given by putting
up advertisements, thirty days before the sale, in five public places,
one of which shall be at the court house ; and, in case of the sale of
any personal property, notice shall be given by putting up advertise

ments ten days before the day of sale, in five public places in the
county, one of which shall be at the court house door, and the officer
shall proceed, at the time and place specified in the notice, to sell, by
auction, to the highest bidder, the property levied on, or so much
thereof as will satisfy the execution and all costs.
§ 847. Whenever, from a defect of bidders, caused by inclement
weather or otherwise, the property shall not be likely to command a
reasonable price, the sheriff or officer may adjourn the sale, and readvertise the same for a subsequent sale day ; and whenever the sales
advertised for a particular day shall not be completed on that day,
the same may be continued from day to day until completed, notice
of such continued sale being given to the assembly, at the close of the
first day's sale.
§ 848. If any property taken in execution shall remain in the hands
of the officer unsold, he shall so return on the execution, and there
upon a writ of venditioni exponas shall issue, directed to such officer,
upon which the like proceedings shall be had as might, and ought to
have been had, on the first execution. And if property sold under a
venditioni exponas shall not bring enough to satisfy the judgment,
the officer shall forthwith return the same to the clerk, who shall
thereupon issue another proper execution for the balance remaining
unpaid.
§ 849. Bank notes^ bills, or evidences of debt, circulating as
money, or any share or interest in any incorporated company, belong
ing to the defendant in execution, may be taken and sold, by virtue of
an execution, in the same manner as goods and chattels, or applied to
the payment of the execution ; and the clerk, cashier, or other officer
having the custody of the books of the company, shall, upon
exhibiting to him the writ of execution, be bound to give to the
officer having such writ, a certificate of the number of shares or
amount of the interest held by the defendant in such company, and if he
shall neglect or refuse to do so, or if he shall willfully give a false
certificate thereof, he shall be liable to the plaintiff for double the
amount of all damages occasioned by such neglect or false certificate,
to be recovered in an action on the case against him. The purchaser
of such share or interest, at such sale, shall become the owner thereof,
in the same manner as if such share or interest had been regularly
assigned to him by the defendant.
§ 850. When any officer, under any execution, shall receive the whole
or any part of the money for which the same was issued, and the de
fendant, before payment thereof to the plaintiff, shall obtain an
injunction to such execution, the officer shall repay to the defendant
the money so received, or such part thereof as may be enjoined; and
if any officer shall, when required, fail to repay the money so received
and enjoined, to the person having a right to demand the same,
such officer and his sureties shall be liable to the same remedies as
are given by law to the plaintiff, for the non-payment of money levied
on by execution.

EXECUTIONS—HOW ISSUED.

[Chap. 8.

§ 851. When the officer shall return on any execution, that no
property of the defendant is to be found in his county, and the plain
tiff shall suggest in writing, to the court which rendered the judg
ment, that the defendant hath property, but hath fraudulently con
veyed the same, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, or to avoid
the payment of the execution, a summons shall issue to the person or
persons in whose hands such property is supposed to be, or having
such fraudulent conveyance ; and, on the return thereof, executed as
in other cases, an issue shall be made up and tried by a jury; and if
the jury shall find the conveyance fraudulent, or without valuable
consideration, the property thus fraudulently conveyed or made over
shall be subject to the plaintiff's execution.
§ 852. No goods or chattels, lying or being upon any messuage,
lands, or tenements leased for life, years at will, or otherwise, shall at
any time be liable to be taken, by virtue of any writ of fieri facias, or
other process whatever, unless the party so taking the same shall,
before the removal of the goods from such premises, pay or tender to
the landlord or lessor thereof all money due for the rent of said
premises, at the time of taking such goods and chattels in execution,
whether the day of payment, by the terms of the lease, shall have
come or not ; provided, the money due shall not amount to more
than one year's rent, and, if more be due, then the party suing out
such execution, paying or tendering to such landlord or lessor one
year's rent, may proceed to execute his judgment, and the officer
levying the same is hereby empowered and required to levy and pay
to the plaintiff, as well the money so paid for rent, as the execution
money.
§ 853. If a distringas issue in detinue, the court or judge in vaca
tion, on being satisfied that the specific thing cannot be delivered,
may order the writ to be superseded, os to the specific thing, and to
be executed for the alternative price or value ascertained by the
judgment.
§ 854. When lands or tenements shall be sold by virtue of any
writ of fieri facias or other process, the officer making the sale shall,
on payment of the purchase money, execute to the purchaser a deed
of conveyance, which shall vest in the purchaser all the right, title
and interest which the defendant had in and to such lands and tene
ments, and which by law could be sold, under execution or other pro
cess.
§ 855. When a defendant in execution shall own or be entitled to
an undivided interest in any property, not "exclusively in his own possession, such interest may be levied on, and sold by the sheriff, with
out taking the property into actual possession; and such sale shall
vest in the purchaser all the interest of the defendant in such pro
perty.
. • •
> *
§ 856. When the officer taking property under execution, shall die
before the sale thereof, a writ of venditioni exponas shall issue,

Chap. 8.]

EXECUTIONS—HOW ISSUED.

177

directed to the proper officer of the county in which the propertywas taken ; and such officer shall, under the said writ of vendi
tioni exponas, receive the property from the representatives of
the former sheriff or other officer, who are required to deliver the
same to the officer having said venditioni exponas, on his producing
the same, and executing a receipt for the property, and such officer
shall proceed to sell the same, as in other cases,
| 857. If the representatives of the deceased officer shall refuse
or neglect to deliver the property on demand made, as aforesaid,
or if, after three months from the death of the officer taking such
property, there shall be no executor or administrator on his estate,
the officer having such writ of venditioni exponas may seize the
property taken by the former officer, wherever it may be found, and
sell the same as in other cases ; or the plaintiff may move, in the
court from which the execution issued, against the representatives of
the deceased officer and his sureties, giving two day's notice of such
motion, and thereupon judgment shall be entered up against the
representatives of the deceased officer and his sureties, for the amount
of the execution, which came to the hands of such deceased officer,
with interest and costs.
§ S5S. AVhen any person, not a party to an execution, shall claim
to be the owner of any personal property levied upon by virtue
thereof, such person may make oath or affirmation to his right and
title to the property so levied on, and may enter into bond, payable
to the plaintiff in the execution, with one or more good sureties, in
the penalty of double the amount of the fair value of the property so
claimed, which value shall be estimated by the officer holding such
execution, and shall be endorsed thereon, conditioned for the prose
cution of said claim, with effect, or, in case he fail therein for the
payment to the plaintiff in execution- of all such damages as may be
awarded against the claimant, in case his claim shall not be sustained,
or shall appear to have been made for fraudulent purposes, or for de
lay, and that he will well and truly deliver the same property to the
sheriff or other officer, if the claim thereto should be determined
against the claimant ; and upon the making of such affidavit and
bond, the sheriff or other officer holding the execution, shall receive
the same, and shall deliver said property to said claimant, and shall
return said affidavit and bond with the execution, and the court shall
thereupon direct an issue to be made up between the parties, to try
the right of property before a jury, at the same term, unless good
cause be shown for a continuance.
§ S59. Further proceedings on such execution shall be stayed, for
an amount equal to the value of the property so claimed, as endorsed
and returned by the officer, until the final decision of such claim ; and
on all subsequent executions issued on the same judgment, prior to
the final decision of said claim, the clerk shall endorse the amount
12

[Chap. 8.

of said estimated value, for the government of the officer to whom
the same may be directed.
§ 860. If, by default of the plaintiff in execution, an issue for the
trial of the right of property so levied on and claimed, be not made
up at the term to which such execution is returnable, the court shall
discharge the claimant from his bond, and the said property shall
never thereafter be subject to such an execution; but, if from the
default of the claimant, such issue be not made up at the first
term of said court, the said court shall cause a jury to be empaneled,
at the instance of the plaintiff in the execution, and sworn to execute
a writ of inquiry as to the value of the property claimed by said
claimant, and also, to inquire whether or not the claim was made for
fraudulent purposes, or for purposes of delay.
§ 861. On the trial of an issue made up on a claim of
property, the burden of proof shall be on the plaintiff in execution ;
and such issue shall be tried and governed by the same rules which
regulate and govern the trial of an issue in an action of detinue ; and
either party to such issue shall have all the rights of continuances,
new trials or appeals, in the same manner as in any action of detinue ;
and the final judgment, on any such issue, shall have the like effect on
the rights of the parties thereto as if the same had been given in an ac
tion of detinue ; and the jury trying such issue, in case they find in favor
of the plaintiff in execution, shall assess the true value of the
property so found subject to such execution, and shall also
certify whether the claim of the claimant was made for fraudulent
purposes, or for purposes of delay ; and if the jury shall omit to find
such value, a writ of inquiry may be awarded. The valuation of the
officer taking the bond of the claimant shall in all cases he primafacie
evidence of the value of the property; and in case the jury fail to
find the value of the property, the plaintiff may, at his election, take
judgment for the value assessed by the said officer, without resorting
to a writ of inquiry.
§ 862. Whenever a verdict shall be rendered in such case in favor
of the plaintiff in execution, either on an issue joined, or an inquiry
by default, the court shall pronounce such judgment as would be given
in an action of detinue, for the specific property, if to be had, and if
not, for its value as assessed by the jury, and costs of suit ; and if
the jury shall find that such claim was made for fraudulent purposes,
or for purposes of delay, the plaintiff shall also recover ten per centum
damages, on the assessed value of said property, which judgment shall
be rendered jointly against the claimant, or his executors or adminis
trators, and the surety or sureties in his bond given on said claim, or
such of said sureties as may be living at the time of said judgment,
and execution shall issue thereon accordingly; and the original execu
tion levied on said property shall be credited by the amount of the
value of said property, as assessed by the jury, and determined by the
judgment of the court thereupon, to bear date of the rendition of

such judgment ; and if any balance shall then remain unpaid on said
original execution, another execution may be issued therefor against
the defendant or defendants therein. And in all cases where the
value of the property so levied on and claimed, may be assessed at
an amount greater than sufficient to satisfy said original execution,
the true amount due thereon shall be endorsed by the clerk, on the
execution issued against said claimant,- and the amount of such original
execution, with interest and all costs, shall be received of said claim
ant, in lull satisfaction thereof.
§ 863. Should the plaintiff or claimants, or any one or more of
them, die before final judgment on such claims of property, the same
may be prosecuted or defended by the executors or administrators of
such deceased party, and such executors or administrators, may volun
tarily appear and become parties thereto ; and in case the executors
or administrators of such deceased claimant or claimants shall not
voluntarily appear, or shall neglect or refuse to become parties to the
said proceeding, after having been duly served with a scire facias,

decay, or if subject to extraordinary expense in preserving the same,
and hold the proceeds subject to the future orders of the court.
§ 1013. Whenever it shall be made to appear, to the satisfaction
of the chancellor, by affidavit or otherwise, that any defendant to a
cause in his court is a non-resident of the state, or cannot be found

ceedings, on liberal terms, to prevent delay and injustice, at anytime
before the cause has been submitted.
§ 1029. Answers of defendants out of the state may be sworn to
before any commissioner for this state, or any judge, chancellor, or
any justice of the peace, notary public, or the mayor, or alderman of
any city or town, or clerk of a court of record, in the state or county
where such defendant may be, if such officer shall be authorized to
administer oaths by the law of such state or county ; and the certifi
cate of such officer, as to his official character, and his authority to ad
minister oaths, shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
§ 1030. Any defendant in a chancery suit may make his answer a
cross-bill against the complainant, or his co-defendant or defendants, or

be paid by any person, shall bear interest until paid, in the same

in term-time, or in vacation, he may direct the proceedings on the

§ 1035. The chancery courts shall have power to decree that either
party shall pay the costs of any suit in equity, or that the same be

office, and if not paid at maturity, shall have the force and effect of a
judgment; and the clerk shall issue execution thereon. If any of the
obligors shall be dead, the execution shall issue against the survivors,

require security to restrain the defendants within the state, from pay
ing, conveying away, or secreting the debts by them owing to, or the
effects in their hands, belonging to such non-resident, absent or ab

effects to be delivered to the complainant, on his giving security for
the return thereof, in such manner as the court may direct.
§ 1040. Publication shall be made in the manner directed by this
chapter, requiring the said absent debtors to appear and give security
for the performance of the decree; but such defendant may appear,
and plead, demur or answer to the bill, without giving security ; but
the lien of the creditor upon the property attached shall not be af
fected thereby.
§ 1041. If a decree shall be rendered in such case, without the
appearance of such absent debtor, the court, before any proceeding to
satisfy said decree, shall require of the complainant to give security
for abiding such further orders as may be made for restoring the
estate or effects to the absent defendant, on his appearing and answer
ing the bill ; and if the complainant shall not give such security, the

by the chancellor, or by the clerk issuing the injunction, condi
tioned for paying all money and costs due, or to become due to the
plaintiff in the action at law, and also such costs and damages as shall
be awarded against him, in case the injunction shall be dissolved ;
which bond shall be taken by the clerk issuing the injunction, and
shall be by him filed with the bill, and safely transmitted to the court
in which the bill is filed. If any clerk shall, in any case, issue an in
junction without having first taken bond, as required by law, he shall
forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of five hundred dollars, to be
recovered in an action of debt; and shall, moreover, be liable on his
official bond for all damages sustained thereby.
§ 1045. Where the injunction obtained shall not be for the stay of
proceedings in an action at law, for the recovery of money, or upon a
judgment requiring the payment of money, the party obtaining the
injunction shall, before the issuance of the same, enter into bond in
the like manner, in a sufficient penalty, to be fixed by the chancellor
granting the same, conditioned for the payment of all damages and
costs which may be awarded against him, or which the opposite party
may otherwise suffer or sustain, by reason of the suing out of said
injunction, in case the same shall be dissolved.
§ 1046. When an injunction shall be granted to stay the sale of
personal property, levied on by virtue of an execution, the chancellor

giving bond to the sheriff, with good sureties, in double the value of
the property, to be assessed by such sheriff, payable to the plaintiff in
the execution, and conditioned for the re-delivery of the property to
said sheriff, in case the injunction shall be dissolved; which bond shall
be returned by the sheriff, with the execution, and shall have the force
and effect of a judgment; and in case the property shall not be re
delivered to the said sheriff or his successor, within fifteen days after
the dissolution of such injunction, the clerk of the court to which the
bond was returned, shall issue execution thereon, for the amount of
the assessed value of said property, and all costs. But in such cases,
the lien on the property created by the judgment or decree, and the
execution and levy, shall remain in force, and the sheriff, on a writ of
venditioni exponas, or other order of sale, may seize the property so
levied on wherever the same may be found.

§ 1047. When an injunction shall be granted to stay the execution

j udgment at law for money, shall be dissolved, in whole or in part,

ment enjoined, or to so much thereof as shall be found due, including
the costs ; and the clerk of the chancery court shall certify such dis
solution, to the clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered,
who shall thereupon issue execution, as well for the original debt and
costs, as for the damages aforesaid. Damages, at the same rate, shall
be allowed upon the dissolution of injunctions to stay sales under
deeds of trust or mortgages, with power of sale; and such damages
may be added to the debt, and collected by the sale of the property,
or execution may issue from the chancery court for the same, together
with the costs of suit.
§ 1052. A receiver shall not be appointed, unless the party pray
ing the appointment shall have given the opposite party at least ten

and to such persons, as the court may at any time direct, and will in
all things faithfully discharge the duties of his office as receiver ;

in suit, in the name of the state, for the use of any party aggrieved
from time to time, until the whole penalty shall be recovered.
§ 1054. Receivers shall receive such fair and reasonable compen
sation for their services, as the court shall allow, and shall have a

shall refuse to give evidence, such master or commissioner shall pro
ceed by process of attachment to compel the witness to attend and
give evidence. They shall have all other powers properly belonging
to masters and commissioners in chancery.
§ 1061. If any witness, sworn or affirmed by any master or com

article, shall exercise or perform any of the duties or functions of said

to administer, according to law and the orders of the court, each and
every estate which may be committed to his charge, and that he will
well and truly account for, and pay over, all moneys in his hands, by
virtue of his said office, when thereto required by orders of the court.
§ 1094. Should such county administrator resign his office, or
otherwise vacate it, he shall forthwith file an account of his adminis

submit, according to law, separate settlements of all estates, so far as
the deceased county administrator had progressed with the same, to
be proceeded with, according to the provisions contained in this article.
§ 1095. Whenever it shall appear to the satisfaction of any chan

article, is not sufficient in amount to secure a faithful discharge of the
duties of the county administrator, it shall be lawful for such chan
cellor, after proper notice given, to require the said administrator to
give an additional bond, in such penalty as the chancellor may deem
sufficient, to secure the rights of all parties interested ; and on a non

§ 109S. Taking the proof of wills, and granting letters testamen
tary thereon, shall appertain to the chancery court of the county, in
which the deceased had a mansion house, or fixed place of residence ;
but if he had no fixed place of residence, and the lands be devised in
the will, it shall be proved in the county where the lands lie, or in
one of them, where there shall be lands in several counties ; and if
the testator have no fixed place of residence, and if personal estate,
only, be disposed of by the will, it may be proved either in the coun
ty where the testator died, or in that county in which the greater
part of the property may be.
§ 1099. When any last will and testament is exhibited to be
proved, the court, or clerk, in vacation, may proceed immediately to
take the probate thereof; but any person interested, may, at any time
within two years, by petition or bill, contest the validity of such will;
and an issue shall be made up and tried as other issues to determine
whether the writing produced be the will of the testator or not ; and
the verdict of the jury shall be final between the parties to the issue,
saving the right to grant new trials as in other cases; but if no party
shall appear, within two years, to contest the will, the probate shall
be final and forever binding, saving to infants, and persons non com
pos mentis and fanes covert, the period of two years to contest the
will, after the removal of their respective disabilities : provided, that
in casje of a concealed fraud, the limitation provided by this article,
shall commence to run at, and not before, the time when such fraud
shall be, or with reasonable diligence, might have been first known
or discovered.
§1100. When any will shall be exhibited for probate, and any wit
ness who attested the same, shall be absent, or reside out of the state
the court may direct a commission to issue to take his deposition, as
in other cases of non-resident witnesses, to which the will shall
be attached, or the clerk in vacation may issue such commission ;
and if the commissioner to whom the commission is directed, shall,
certify, in the manner such acts are usually authenticated, that the
witness personally appeared before him, and made oath or affirmation,
that the testator, or testatrix, signed and published the writing an

214

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

nexed to the commission, as his or her last will and testament, or
that some other person, naming him, signed it by the direction of, and
in the presence of the testator or testatrix ; that the testator, or tes tatrix was of sound and disposing mind, and that the witness sub
scribed his name thereto in presence of, and by request of the testa
tor or testatrix, such oath shall have the same operation as if th e
witness had been present in court, and the will shall be admitted to
probate. But before such original will shall be sent, abroad for proof,
the clerk shall make and certify to a true copy thereof, and file such
copy in his office.
§ 1101. If any person shall be a subscribing witness to a will,
wherein any devise or bequest is made to such subscribing witness,
and the will cannot otherwise be proved, such devise or bequest shall
be void, and the witness shall be competent, as to the residue of the
will, as if no such devise or bequest had been made, and shall be
compelled to testify. But if such witness would have been entitled
to any share of the testator's estate, in case the will was not estab
lished, then so much of said share shall be saved to said witness, as
shall not exceed the value of the devise or bequest, made to him in
the will.
§ 1102. Any creditor, whose debt is secured by express lien, or by
operation of law, shall be a competent witness to a last will and testa
ment ; but any special provision, in favor of such creditor in the will,
either by admitting the debt, or by providing for its payment, or by
giving it a preference, shall be void, and such claim shall stand as
though no such provision had been made.
§ 1103. The chancery court having jurisdiction, on being informed
that any person has the last will and testament of a testator or
testatrix, may compel such person to produce it ; and, if any person
to whom a will or codicil has been delivered for safe custody, by the
party making it, shall alter or destroy the same without authority,
or willfully secrete it for six months after the death of the testator
shall be known to him, on conviction thereof, such person so offend
ing shall be sentenced to such punishment as the law prescribes for
grand larceny.
§ 1104. All original wills, after probate thereof, shall be recorded,
and remain in the office of the clerk of the court where they were
proved, except during the time they may be removed to any other
court, under proper process, from which they shall be duly returned
to the proper office ; and authenticated copies of wills and testaments,
or codicils, which have been duly recorded in the proper office, shall
be admitted as evidence in any court of law or equity in this state.
§ 1105. Authenticated copies of wills, proved according to the
laws of any of the states of the Union, or of the territories, or any
country out of the limits of the United States, and touching or dis
posing of estate within this state, may be admitted to probate in the

215

proper court, but such will shall be liable to be contested, as the
original would have been, if it had been executed in this state.
§ 1106. The executors named in any last will and testament,
whether made in this state or admitted to probate here on an au
thenticated copy, shall be entitled to letters testamentary thereon, if
not legally disqualified, which shall be granted by the court before
which the probate was made, or by the clerk, in vacation. But no one
shall be capable of being executor, who, at the time when letters
testamentary ought to be granted, is under the age of eighteen years,
of unsound mind, incapable of making a contract, or convicted of a
crime rendering him infamous. A married woman shall not be ap
pointed, unless her husband, with two good and sufficient sureties,
shall give the requisite bond ; and if the executors named be not
legally qualified, by reason of any of the causes above named, or
should afterwards become disqualified, the court or clerk may proceed
to grant administration with the will annexed. On all questions
touching such qualifications, the court shall receive the like testi
mony as would be admissible in a court of law or equity in similar
cases, and the party shall be summoned ; and the husband of any
executrix, who may marry after her appointment, shall in like manner
give bond, or she shall be removed.
§ 1107. The age of eighteen shall be the age of majority of an
executor or executrix, and in case letters testamentary shall be granted
to any one above eighteen and under twenty-one years, the bond exe
cuted by such person, for the performance of the duties, shall be as
valid and binding, as if such person were of full age.
§ 110S. If there should be no executor named in any last will and
testament, or if the executors named, all renounce the executorship,
or, being required to qualify, shall all refuse or fail to do so, or shall
refuse or willfully neglect, for the space of forty days after the death
of the testator or testatrix, to exhibit such will and testament for pro
bate, then, administration of the goods and chattels, with the will an
nexed, shall be granted to the person who would be entitled to ad
minister, according to the rule prescribed for granting administration.
But before granting such administration, each executor named in such
will and testament, who has not renounced the executorship, shall be
summoned to show cause why administration should not be granted ;
and if any executor named, be absent from the state, at the time
of the probate of the will, and administration should be granted
during such absence, such executor shall be allowed forty days after
his return to make application for letters testamentary, and on his
qualifying, the letters of administration shall be revoked, and the
estate, both real and personal, shall be disposed of, according to the
will. The administrator shall deliver all the estate which has come
to his hands to the executor, and immediately settle the account of
his administration with the chancery court.
§ 1109. Every executor or administrator with the will annexed, at

216

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

the time of obtaining letters testamentary, or of administration, shall,
in open court, or before the clerk, take the following oath, viz :
" You do swear that the writing now exhibited by you, is the true
last will and testament of
, as far as you know and believe, and
that you, as executor, will well and truly execute the same according
to its tenor, and discharge the duties required by law ;" and he shall
also give bond, in such penalty as will be equal to the full value of
the estate at least, and with such sureties as may be approved of by
the court, or the clerk, payable to the State of Mississippi, with the
following condition, viz :
"The condition of this bond is, that if the above bound
, as ex
ecutor of the last will and testament of
, shall well and truly
carry out and execute the will, as far as the same may be consistent
with law, and faithfully, truly and promptly perform and discharge all
the duties required of him by law, or by the order of the court, then
this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force." If the
obligor be administrator with the will annexed, then say that " the
above bound
, as administrator, with the will of
, annexed,
will," etc. ; which bond shall not be void on the first recovery, but may
be put in suit, from time to time, until the whole penalty is recovered,
by any party injured by a breach thereof, and at his costs ; but the
amount of recovery shall be appropriated by order of the chancery
court, unless the same be for a specific or certain legacy, or for a dis
tributive share, first ascertained and ordered to be paid ; and such bond
shall be recovered, and a certified copy shall be evidence.
§ 1110. Where the testator, by will, shall direct that his executors
shall not be required to give bond, then none shall be required, unless
the court, at any time, should have good reason to suspect the execu
tor of fraud, or mal-administration, in which event, it shall be the duty
of the chancellor to require bond with good security ; and if it be not
given, to remove the executor, and grant letters of administration with
the will annexed.
§ 1111. Every executor, who has so qualified, shall have a right to
the possession of all the personal estate of the deceased, unless other
wise directed in the will ; and he shall, and may, take all proper steps
to acquire possession of all or any portion thereof that may be with
held from him, and shall manage the same for the best interest of
those concerned, as far as he can do so, consistently with the will, and
according to law. He shall have the proper appraisements made, and
return true and complete inventories ; he shall collect all debts due
the estate, as speedily as may be, and pay all debts that may be due
from it which are properly authenticated, so far as the means in his
hands will allow ; he shall settle his accounts as often as the law may
require him to do so, and pay all the legacies and bequests, as far as
the estate may be sufficient, and shall well and truly execute the will,
if the law will permit ; and he shall also have a right to the possession

Chap. 9.]

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

217

of the real estate, so far as may be necessary to execute the will, and
may have proper remedy therefor.
§ 1112. If there should be any contest about any will, before the
grant of letters testamentary, or if the executor be an infant, or be
absent, or until a will which once existed, but is lost or destroyed,
shall be established, the court or clerk may appoint any person or
persons to collect and preserve the estate of the decedent, until a pro
bate of the will, or during the infancy of the executor, or until admin
istration be granted, taking bond and security for collecting and
making an inventory of the estate, and for the safe keeping and de
livery of the same to the executor or administrator.
§ 1113. The letters so granted shall be in the ordinary form, ex
cept that they shall. express that they are granted only during the ex
istence of the controversy about the will, or during the infancy, or the
absence of the executor, as the case may be ; and the bond shall be
in the form, or to the effect, of a bond given by an administrator, with
the will annexed, except that it shall be conditioned for the discharge
of the duties of the office of collector of the goods, chattels, personal
estate, debts and money of the deceased, and for the delivery of the
same to the executor when qualified. And the person so appointed,
shall also take the following oath before the chancellor or clerk, viz :
" You do swear that you will well and truly discharge the duties of
the office of collector of the goods, chattels, personal estate, and debts
of
, deceased, according to the tenor of the letters granted to
you, and agreeably to law, to the best of your ability."
§ 1114. Every collector so appointed, shall have power to collect
the goods, chattels, personal property and debts, and to secure the
same ; and immediately after appraisement, the court may authorize
him to sell such as may be perishable, and to dispose of the crops for
cash, by shipment or otherwise, and to account for the same ; and the
court may allow such compensation as may seem just, not exceeding
five per cent, on the amount collected and administered, or not exceed
ing three per cent, on the whole inventory.
§ 1115. Every collector so appointed, shall have power to bring
suits for debts due the estate; and to give acquittances on payment :
he may also bring suits for property. And he may be sued as an ad
ministrator might be ; and suits brought by him, or against him, shall
not abate by the termination of his authority, but may be prosecuted
by, or against, the executor, and judgments recovered by, or against
such collector, may be proceeded in to collection by, or against, the
executor.
§ 1116. On the granting of letters testamentary, the powers of
such collector shall cease, and it shall be his duty to settle his accounts
with the court, and to deliver all the estate that may be in his hands,
on demand, to the person obtaining such letters ; and in case of re
fusal, the court may proceed against him by attachment, and impose
a fine, not exceeding twenty per cent, upon the amount of property

[CHAP. 9.

in his hands, and his bond may be put in suit by the executor or per
son to 'whom letters may be granted. He shall furnish such executor
or administrator with a list of all judgments and suits against him.
§ 1117. In taking the ordinary probate of wills, all of the sub
scribing witnesses alive, and within the jurisdiction of the court, and
whose presence can be secured, shall be produced before the clerk, or
court, to testify as to the execution thereof. If, however, any resident
witness shall be too old or infirm to attend court, the deposition of
such witness may be taken, on motion of any person interested in
establishing the will, according to the general rules for taking evi
dence in the chancery court.
§ 1118. The person to whom administration is granted shall take
the following oath :
" You do swear that
, deceased, died without any will, so far as
you know or believe, and that you will well and truly administer all
and singular, the goods, chatties, and credits of the deceased, and
pay his debts, as far as his goods, chattels, and credits will extend,
and the law requires you ; that you will make a true and proper in
ventory of the said goods, chattels and credits, as also a just account,
when thereto required, so help you God ;" and shall also give bond, in
a penalty at least equal to the value of all the personal estate, with
such sureties as may be approved of by the court, or by the clerk in
vacation, payable to the State of Mississippi, with condition in form,
or to the effect following, to-wit :
" The condition of this bond is, that if the above bound
, as ad
ministrator of the goods and chattels, rights and credits of
, de
ceased, shall faithfully, truly and promptly perform and discharge all
the duties required of him by law, or by the order ot the court, then
this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force ;" which
bond shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the chancery court,
and may be put in suit by any person injured by a breach thereof, at
his costs, but the amount of recovery shall be appropriated by the
chancery court, unless it be for a distributive share first ascertained.
A certified copy of such bond shall be admitted in evidence in any
court in this State.
§ 1119. If a will shall be found and proved, and letters testament
ary be granted, within sixty days after such proof, the same shall be
construed as a revocation of the administration, but acts lawfully and
previously done by the administrator shall be valid.
§ 1120. If any executor or administrator shall die, resign or be re
moved, or become incompetent, before a final settlement of the estate,
letters of administration de bonis non, shall be granted to the person
entitled, under the rules heretofore laid down, and he shall proceed
in the administration of the estate to final settlement, and the letters,
bond and oath, shall be in the common form, substituting proper words
to show the character of the administration, and in no case shall the ex
ecutor of an executor, be entitled, in right of his office, to administra

tion de bonis non on the estate of the first deceased, but such execu
tor, or the administrator of an executor, or the executor or adminis
trator of an administrator, shall settle the accounts of their testator,
or intestate, in his administration of the first estate, and for that pur
pose shall be amenable to the jurisdiction of the proper court.
§ 1121. If the sureties taken, on granting letters testamentary, or
of administration, should be discovered to have been insufficient at
the time, or should afterwards become so, the court shall, on the appli
cation of any person interested, and notice to the adverse party,
require such executor or administrator to give new sureties, and in
default thereof, within a reasonable time, the letters may be revoked,
and administration be granted to the person next entitled to it, if
such person should apply, or if not, to the county administrator ; or
the sureties, originally taken, if they apprehend danger, may petition
the court to require the executor or administrator to give a new
bond, and that they may be discharged from further responsibility;
and the court shall grant such petition, and require new sureties ; and
in case of refusal to comply, the executor or administrator may be
removed, and administration de bonis non be granted; but the exec
utor or administrator shall have the proper notice of such application,
and the acts done by the executor or administrator, and all proceedings
that may have been instituted against him, shall be treated or con
ducted, by or against his successor, as in case of the death of an
executor or administrator; and if the executor or administrator shall
give a new bond, as required, the original bond shall, from that time,
cease to be operative in future, but not as to previous liabilities.
.§ 1122. Every executor or administrator may be removed, if he
should become disqualified, or for improper conduct in office, at the
instance of any person interested, on proper notice to such executor
or administrator; or they may surrender the trust, on giving the
proper notice to the distributees or legatees, and by settling with the
court, so far as they may have administered the estate ; and, in case
of removal or resignation, administration shall be granted, as in case
of the death of the executor or administrator, and with like effect on
all the proceedings by or against the executor or administrator ; but
every executor or administrator who may be removed, or who may
surrender his trust, until his final settlement, and until satisfaction
shall be made, and until that time, shall be liable on his bond ; and if
any administratrix shall marry, her husband shall give bond, as in
case of the marriage of an executrix.
§ 1123. It shall be the duty of every executor, administrator and
collector, to make out in writing, and return to the proper court,
under oath, a true and perfect inventory of the personalty of such
estate. If the property be in more than one county, and cannot be
conveniently collected together, warrants of appraisement shall be
issued to all the counties in which the same may be situate, to be pro
ceeded with as hereinafter directed.

[Chap. 9.

§ 1124. On granting letters testamentary, or of administration, or
of collection, a warrant or warrants shall be issued by the clerk, under
the seal of the court, authorizing three or more discreet persons, any
three or more of whom may^act, not related to the deceased, or inter
ested in the estate, to appraise the goods, chattels and personal estate
of the deceased, which may be shown to them, or which may come to
their knowledge ; which warrant shall be in form or to the effect fol
lowing :
"The State of Mississippi, to
, Greeting:
" This is to authorize you, jointly, to appraise the goods, chattels
and personal estate of
, late of
county, deceased, so far as
the same shall come to your sight and knowledge, each of you having
first taken the oath or affirmation hereto annexed, a certificate
whereof you are to return, annexed to an inventory of the said goods,
chattels, and personal estate, by you appraised, in dollars and cents,
and in the said inventory, you are to set down, in a column or
columns, opposite to each article, the value thereof.
[Witness]
"
, Chancellor of
District.
"
, Clerk.''
And in case any appraiser so appointed should die, or refuse to act,
another warrant may forthwith be issued to some other person, and
the appraisers, before they proceed to act, shall take the following
oath or affirmation, to be endorsed on or annexed to the warrant, be
fore any person authorized to administer an oath, to-wit:
"I, A. B., swear (or affirm), that I will well and truly, without par
tiality or prejudice, value and appraise the goods, chattels, and personal
estate of
, deceased, so far as the same shall come to my sight
and knowledge, and will, in all respects, perform my duty as appraiser,
to the best of my skill and judgment, so help me, God."
§ 1125. The appraisers shall discharge their duty as speedily as
may be, and shall set down each article, and opposite to it, in a proper
column, the value thereof, in figures, and the contents of each
column shall be cast up, and set down at the bottom ; and when the
inventory shall be finished, the appraisers shall certify the same
under their hands, with a certificate of their having taken the proper
oath thereto annexed ; and they shall each receive two dollars per
day while they are so engaged, to be paid out of the estate, by the
executor or administrator.
§ 1126. Every inventory and appraisement, so made out, shall be
delivered to the administrator or executor, and, by him, shall be
returned to the proper office, within three calendar months from the
date of the letters testamentary or of administration, unless the court
should grant further time ; and if any executor or administrator should
fail to return the inventory at the time required by law, or by the
order of the court, an attachment may issue to enforce the return, and
on return of the attachment, the court shall have power to fine the
party, not exceeding fifty dollars.

221

§ 1127. Every executor and administrator shall, within the time
above prescribed, return an inventory, verified by oath, of the money
belonging to the deceased, which has come into his hands, and ot the
debts due the deceased, which have come to his knowledge, specifying
the nature of each debt, setting down such as may be deemed good,
distinct and separate from those which may be deemed desperate and
doubtful.
§ 1128. The bare naming of an executor in a will, shall not operate
to extinguish any just claim, which the deceased had against him,
but it shall be the duty of every such executor, accepting the trust,
to give in such claim in the list of debts ; and, on his failure to give
in such claim, or any part thereof, any person interested in the estate
may allege the same, by petition to the court, and the court, with the
consent of parties, may decide on the validity of the claim, if it be
denied. If such consent be not given, the validity of such claim
shall, by order of the chancellor, be tested by suit, in some common
law court having jurisdiction. And when the claim is established,
the executor shall account for it as a debtor to the estate, and not
otherwise ; and in the same way, and subject to all the foregoing pro
visions, shall an administrator give in a claim against himself.
§ 1129. Whenever personal property of any kind, or assets, not
mentioned in the previous inventory, shall come to the possession
or knowledge of the executor, administrator, or collector, an account
or inventory of the same shall be returned, and shall be appraised
by sworn appraisers, as in other cases, within one calendar month
from the time of discovery.
§ 1130. In case an inventory be returned by a collector, the execu
tor or administrator who may succeed to the administration, shall
within three calendar months after the grant of his letters, either re
turn a new inventory, in place of the collector's inventory, or file a
written acknowledgment of the receipt of the articles contained in
the first inventory, and consent to be answerable for the same, in the
same manner as if the inventory had been made out after the grant
of letters testamentary, or of administration ; but if the goods, chat
tels and effects are improperly withheld from the executor or admin
istrator, then the executor or administrator shall not be answerable
for a failure to return the inventories herein required, until after the
goods, chattels, and effects have been received from the collector.
§ 1131. If any executor, administrator or collector, shall fail to re
turn proper inventories, within the time prescribed by law, or by the
order of the court, a summons shall be issued, by order of the chan
cellor, against such executor, administrator, or collector, to show cause
at the next term why such inventory hath not been returned ; and if
the summons be returned executed, or upon two citations returned not
found, by the sheriff of the proper county, if such party do not ap
pear, or appearing, shall fail to show good cause, the court shall pro
ceed to revoke the letters, and grant administration anew, as though

222

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[ClUP. 9.

such former executor, administrator or collector, had never obtained
the grant of letters ; and on such revocation, the power of such ex
ecutor, administrator or collector shall cease, and he shall deliver
over to the person appointed in his stead, all the property, goods,
chattels and effects of the deceased in his hands, or be liable to be
sued on his bond.
§ 1132. If there be more than one executor, administrator, or col
lector, they shall all join in returning the inventory ; but, if one or more
refuse to do so, the others may return the inventory, and the power
and authority of the person so refusing shall thereafter cease, and
those who return the inventory shall proceed in the administration,
unless the delinquent shall, within one month, assign a reasonable ex
cuse, which the court may deem satisfactory.
§ 1133. If any person interested in an estate, shall discover that
the inventory returned does not contain a full and perfect account of
all the property, goods, chattels, and effects of the deceased, such per
son may, on petition to the court, have the executor, administrator or
collector cited to appear and show cause why an additional inventory
should not be returned ; and if, on hearing, the court should be satis
fied that a true inventory was not originally returned, it may order the
executor, or administrator, to return a new one, and on his failure to
do so, his letters shall be revoked, and his bond put in suit.
But, if
the title to any property not inventoried, be in dispute, it shall be suf
ficient for the executor, administrator or collector so to report, and he
shall not be required to return an additional inventory, until the title
is settled in his favor ; and it shall also be the duty of every executor
and administrator, to return additional inventories, at least once in
each year, of the increase of the property of t he estate, if there be any
such increase.
§ 1134. The goods, chattels, personal estate, choses in action, and
money of the deceased, or which may have accrued to his estate, after
his death, from the sale of property, real or personal, or otherwise,
whether he died testate or intestate, shall be assets, and shall stand
chargeable with all the just debts and funeral expenses of the deceased,
and the expenses of settling the estate ; and the lands, tenements,
and hereditaments of the testator or intestate, shall also stand charge
able for the debts, over and above what the personal estate may be
sufficient to pay, and may be subjected to the payment of debts, in the
manner hereinafter directed.
§ 1135. It shall be the duty of every executor and administrator,
to proceed to pay the debts, as speedily as may be, out of the assets
which may come to his hands, if the estate .be solvent ; and, in order
that its true condition may be speedily known, it shall be the duty of
the executor or administrator, within one month after the grant of his
letters, to publish, in some newspaper, printed in the county, or in
some- adjacent county, a notice, requesting all persons having claims
against the estate of his testator or intestate, to exhibit the same

and have them registered, in the manner and within the time, pres
cribed by law, or they will be forever barred, which notice shall state
the time when the letters were granted, and shall be published for
three consecutive weeks, or longer, if the court should so direct.
§ 1136. Mere probate and registration of a claim, shall not make it
imperative on an executor or administrator to pay the same. On the
contrary, if the executor or administrator have good cause to believe
that the claim is unjust, he shall withhold payment, until the same
shall be established by suit.
§ 1137. No executor, administrator, or collector, shall discharge
any claim against the deceased, (otherwise than at his own risk), un
less the same be first passed by the chancery court, granting the ad
ministration, or unless the claim be proved, according to the following
rules, to- wit : The voucher or proof of a judgment or decree, shall
be a short copy thereof, duly certified, under the seal of the court in
which it was obtained, and attested, by the clerk, who shall also cer
tify that there is no entry, or proceeding, in said court, to show that
the judgment has been satisfied ; there shall also be endorsed on, or
annexed to, such voucher, the certificate of some officer, competent to
administer an oath, that the creditor, since the death of the deceased,
hath taken, before him, the following oath, or affirmation, to-wit:
"That he (or she) hath not received any part of the sum for which
the judgment, or decree, was passed, except such as is credited, (if
there should be a credit) ;" and if the creditor be an assignee of the
person who recovered the judgment or decree, the oath shall also
state, in addition to the foregoing, that, to the best of his (or her)
knowledge and belief, no other person has received any part of the
sum due, except such part (if any) as is credited, and an assignee
shall also produce the assignment, under the hand of the assignor, and
if there has been more than one assignment, all shall, in like manner,
be produced.
§ 1138. If a special bail shall have discharged a recognizance or
judgment, against the deceased, he shall be considered a judgment
creditor. If there be more than one creditor, the affidavit, by one,
shall be sufficient. In case the claim be a bond, specialty, note, or
bill of exchange, protested, the voucher shall be the instrument of
writing itself, or a proved copy, in case it be lost, with the certificate
of the oath or affirmation, made as aforesaid, since the death, and en
dorsed thereon, or annexed to it; and the oath shall state that no part
of the money, intended to be secured by such instrument, has been
received, or any security or satisfaction given for the same, except (if
any) what is credited, either by the party himself, or by an assignor,
if he hold by assignment ; in case of a bill of exchange, the protest,
and all other requisites, shall be necessary, to justify the administra
tor, or executor, in making payment or distribution.
§ 1139. If the claim be for rent, the lease shall be produced, or
the contract established by competent witnesses, or the written

224

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

acknowledgment of the contract by the deceased, together with a
statement of the time for which rent is in arrear, and the sum due,
verified by oath, as in case of a note or bond ; and if the creditor be
an assignee, the oath prescribed in such cases shall also be made.
§ 1140. The voucher of any claim, on an open account, shall be
the account itself, with an oath or affirmation endorsed thereon, taken
by the creditor since the death, that the account as stated is just and
true, and that no part of the money stated to be due, or any security
or satisfaction for the same has been received, except (if any) what
is credited ; and moreover, no such account shall be paid, until it is
first allowed by the chancery court in which the estate is adminis
tered, or the chancellor or clerk, in vacation ; and in addition to the
proof above required, no executor, administrator or collector shall
pay any claim against the deceased, unless it be first registered in the
register kept by the clerk of the chancery court for that purpose, as
is required by this article ; and such registration shall be a sufficient
presentation of the claim to the executor, administrator or collector.
§ 1141. All claims against the estate of a deceased person, whether
due or not, shall be registered in the court in which the letters testa
mentary or of administration were granted, within one year after the
first publication of notice to creditors to present their claims ; other
wise the same shall be barred, and no suit shall be maintained thereon
in any court.
§ 1142. The executor or administrator may contest, before the
chancellor or clerk, any claim presented against the estate, and the
chancellor or clerk may refer the same to auditors, who shall hear the
evidence on both sides, if any be offered, and report ; and thereupon
the claim may be allowed or disallowed, according to the report, but
no such proceeding shall be had without notice to the claimant.
§ 1143. In no case shall an executor or administrator be allowed
to retain, for his own claim against the deceased, except the same be
registered as other claims, and passed by the chancery court, or the
clerk, in vacation ; and every such claim shall stand upon an equal
footing with other claims of the same nature.
§ 1144. If it should-be necessary to sell personal property, for the
payment of debts, it shall be the duty of the executor or adminis
trator to present a petition, in writing, to the court, or the clerk, in
vacation, of the proper county, for an order of sale, in which it shall
be made to appear that a sale of part, or the whole of the estate, is
necessary for the payment of debts ; and if the court, or the clerk,
shall be satisfied, after hearing the merits of the petition, that a sale
is necessary, an order may be made for the sale of a part, or the
whole of the personal estate ; and if part only be ordered to be sold,
such property shall be selected as can be sold with the least detri
ment to the distributees, and the executor or administrator shall
advertise such sale, in three or more public places in the county, for
the time prescribed by law ; and, at the time appointed, shall proceed

Chap. 9.]

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

225

to sell the property designated in the order, at public sale, to the
highest bidder, either for cash, or on credit, as the order of sale may
direct ; but in no case shall an administrator or executor become the
purchaser of any property, which he may be ordered to sell by the
court, either directly or indirectly ; nor shall it be lawful for any exec
utor or administrator to take the estate, or any part thereof, at the
appraised value.
§ 1145. The court, or the clerk, may order the sale of perishable
property, on such short notice as it, or he, may deem proper, whether
required for the payment of debts, or not; but, in all other cases,
thirty days" notice shall bo required. All property shall be sold on
such terms as the court may deem most advisable.
§ 1146. When any person shall die, leaving a stock of goods, wares,
and merchandise, of any description, the court may, in its discretion,
allow the executor or administrator to dispose of the same, at private
sale, the terms and conditions of said sale being first made known to,
and approved by the court ; and it shall be lawful for aR executor or
administrator to dispose of the interest of his testator, or intestate, in
any ship, vessel, steamboat, or other water craft, without the same
being present at the time and place of sale.
§ 1147. Whenever personal property shall be sold by an executor
or administrator, for any purpose, he shall make report thereof in
writing, under oath, to the next term of the court, stating the time
and place of sale, the name of the purchaser, and the amount of the
purchase money, and shall also satisfy the court that the directions
prescribed in the decree of sale, have been followed ; and thereupon
the court shall make a decree confirming the sale, unless good cause
be shown to the contrary: provided, that if such sale be not reported
at the next term of the court, the same shall not be void, but the
court may compel the making of such report at a subsequent term,
and may proceed to confirm or set aside the same, and the person fail
ing to make such report in proper time, may be fined as for a contempt,
not exceeding one hundred dollars.
§ 1148. When any executor or administrator shall discover that
the personal property will not be sufficient to pay the debts, he shall
present a petition to the court for the sale of the land of the deceased,
or so much of it as may be necessary for the payment of the debts,
and it shall be his duty to make out and exhibit to the court, at the
time of presenting the petition, a full, just, and true account of the
personal estate, and the debts due from the deceased, which petition
and account shall be presented at least three months before an order
of sale shall be made ; and when it is presented, the court shall order
citations to issue for all persons interested, residing in the state, and
publication to be made, as to all persons residing out of the state, as
herein directed ; and the citations shall be served upon the parties, or
if they be infants, then upon their guardians ; and if no guardian has
15

226

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

been appointed, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem, who shall
attend to the interests of the infants.
§ 1149. The court, at the time specified in the summons or publi
cation, or at such other time as it may appoint, shall hear and
examine, the allegations and proofs, by the executor or administrator,
in support of the petition, and also of other persons interested ; and
if, on such hearing, the court shall be satisfied that the personal
estate is insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased, and shall be of
opinion that the land ought to be sold for that purpose, it may make
a decree for the sale of a part, or the whole, of the land of the de
ceased ; and when a part only is decreed to be sold, the decree shall
specify what part ; but if the real estate be so situated, that a part
cannot be sold, without manifest prejudice to the heirs or devisees,
the court may decree that the whole shall be sold, and the overplus
arising from such sale, after the payment of debts, shall be distributed
amongst the Heirs, according to the will ; and the heir or devisee, whose
lands shall be sold for the payment of debts of the testator or intes
tate, may compel all others, holding or claiming under such intestate
or testator, to contribute in proportion to their respective interests, so
as to equalize the burden of the loss.
§ 1150. Any executor or administrator, who may be ordered, by a
decree of the chancery court, to sell the lands, tenements, and heredi
taments, of his testator or intestate, for the payment of debts, shall
give four weeks' notice of the time and place of sale, by advertise
ments put up in three or more public places, in the county where the
lands are situated, and also by publishing such notice of sale, once a
week, for four consecutive weeks, in some newspaper published in the
county, (or if none be there published, then in a newspaper published
in the most convenient county) ; and shall, at the time and place ap
pointed, being within the county where the land is situated, proceed
to sell the lands, tenements and hereditaments designated, at public
vendue, to the highest bidder, for cash, at public outcry, or upon such
credit as the court may have directed ; and if the sale be on credit,
the purchaser shall give bond and security for the payment of the
purchase money ; and, moreover, the land shall be held liable, and
subject to a lien therefor, as if a mortgage had been executed by the
purchaser, and registered ; and if necessary, the executor or adminis
trator may adjourn the sale from day to day, or from time to time,
not exceeding forty days in the whole, so as best to promote the in
terests of the estate ; but no executor or administrator shall, either
directly or indirectly, become the purchaser at such sale.
§ 1151. When the sale has been completed, the executor or admin
istrator shall make report thereof in writing, under oath, to the court,
stating the time and place of the sale, the name of the purchaser,
and the amount of the purchase money ; and, moreover, shall satisfy
the court that the directions prescribed in the decree of sale have
been followed; and thereupon the court shall proceed to make a
decree, confirming the sale, unless good reason be shown to the con

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

227

trary ; and the court shall, moreover, order the executor or adminis
trator to make a good and sufficient conveyance to the purchaser of
the lands, tenements, and hereditaments so sold, which conveyance
shall vest in the purchaser, as good and perfect an estate, in the
premises therein mentioned, as the heirs or devisees of such testator
or intestate, were seized of, or entitled to, at the time such order of
sale was made. If the executor or administrator, who made the sale,
should die, before making such conveyance, his successor may do so.
If such sale be not reported to the next term of the court, the
samet shall not be void ; but the court may compel a proper report to
be made, at a subsequent term, and may then confirm or set aside
the same, and the person failing to make such report in proper time,
may be fined by the court, as for a contempt, not exceeding one hun
dred dollars.
§ 1152. No sale, by an executor or administrator, shall commence
before the hour of eleven o'clock a. m., on the day appointed, nor be
continued longer than three o'clock of the same day ; but if the time
be insufficient to complete the sale of the estate, it may be continued
from day to day, until the whole has been sold, by giving public notice
to the company present, at the conclusion of each day's sale ; and such
sale, on the succeeding day, shall commence and end as directed for
the first day ; and any sale, conducted in any other manner, than as
herein directed, shall be null and void.
§ 1 1 53. When the estate of any deceased person shall consist of
real estate, and personal property, and it shall be necessary to sell
any portion thereof, for the payment of debts, the chancery court of
the proper county, on petition of the executor or administrator, and
full investigation of the matter, and being satisfied that it would be
to the interest of the distributees to sell the real estate, in preference
to the personal estate, may accordingly decree a sale of the real
estate, or so much as may be necessary, and shall set forth, in the
decree, the reasons on which it was made; and the sale, in such cases,
shall be conducted and made according to all the rules, directions
and provisions contained in this article, and the pr.rties interested
shall be summoned, as required herein.
§ 1154. Executors and administrators m°y either ship to market,
or sell for cash, the cotton raised on the plantation of the deceased, or
any other commodity raised for market, and shall account for the
proceeds thereof, as assets ; but the court may instruct them as to the
disposition of cotton crops.
§ 1155. The court may, by decree, authorize any executor or
administrator to sell, or compromise, any claims due the estate, which
cannot be readily collected, if the executor or administrator shall
petition the court for that purpose, and shall show in such petition,
supported by his affidavit, or other evidence, that such sale or compro
mise will promote the interests of the estate ; but no such order of
sale shall be made, until six months have elapsed from the grant of

228

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

the letters, and not until the next succeeding term after the petition
has been presented; and at the time appointed, the court may hear
the merits of the application, and make the proper decree, and if a
sale be ordered, it shall be made at the court house door, at public
outcry, for cash, to the highest bidder ; but the executor or adminis
trator shall first give twenty days' notice of the time and place of
such sale, by advertising the same, in at least three of the most public
places of the county; and the executor or administrator shall make a
report, in writing, of sales and compromises, made according to the
provisions of this section, to the next succeeding term of the court,
which may then be confirmed, unless good cause be shown for setting
the same aside.
§ 1156. If it shall be deemed proper, by an executor or adminis
trator, that the crop, growing at the time of the death of the testator
or intestate, be disposed of, the court, on application for that purpose,
may decree the sale thereof, either at public or private sale, on a
credit of not less than six months, the purchaser giving good and
sufficient security for the payment of the purchase money; but if the
court should be of opinion that the interest of the estate would be
best promoted, by cultivating and completing the crop, it shall
order and direct the executor or administrator to take charge of the
plantation, and proceed to manage the same, until the crop be com
pleted, retaining, for that purpose, all the supplies and property
employed thereon, and the proceeds shall be assets in his hands, the
necessary expenses of taxes, farming utensils, and of feeding stock
and laborers, the wages of laborers, and other necessary expenses,
being first deducted ; and, in either case, the executor or adminis
trator shall render to the court a true account of the crop; and, in
like manner, it shall be competent for the court to authorize the exec
utor or administrator to continue to cultivate the farm of the deceased,
until the final settlement of the administration accounts, if, in the
opinion of the court, the interests of the estate would be promoted
thereby, and if it can be done without prejudice to the rights of heirs,
legatees, or distributees.
§ 1157. In all cases, where the value of an estate shall not be
more than five hundred dollars, the court shall dispense with all news
paper notices, and order notices to be posted, for thirty days, at the
court house door, and two other of the most public places in the
county.
§ 1158. Every executor or administrator shall take all proper steps,
speedily to ascertain whether the estate be solvent or insolvent; and,
if it be ascertained that the estate, both real and personal, will be
insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased, the executor or adminis
trator shall exhibit to the court, under oath, in writing, a just and true
account of all the personal estate, and assets of every description or
kind, and also a true list, or account, of the lands, tenements, or here
ditaments of the deceased: and shall al*o exhibit to the court, at the

Chap. 9.]

ADMINISTEItlXG ESTATES.

229

same time, a schedule of all the debts duo from the deceased ; and,
if it shall appear to the court that the estate is insolvent, it shall
make an order for the sale of all the property ; and the proceeds of
such sale, and all other assets, shall be equally distributed among all
the creditors, in proportion to the sums to them respectively due and
owing, the expenses of the last sickness, and for the funeral and court
costs, being first paid ; but, before any such decree of sale is made,
the court shall direct a summons to issue to the heirs or devisees,
residing in the state, and publication to be made as to the heirs or de
visees residing out of the state, returnable at the next succeeding term
after the order for such process is made ; and if any of the distributees
or devisees be infants, the process shall be served upon their guardians,
and if no guardian has been appointed, the court shall appoint a
guardian ad litem, who shall attend to the interests of the infants.
And, at the time specified in the summons or publication, or at such
other time as may be appointed, the court shall proceed to hear the
allegations, and examine the proofs, of the executor or administrator,
and also of other persons interested; and if, on such hearing, the
court shall be satisfied that the estate is insolvent, it may make a
decree for the sale of the estate, both real and personal.
§ 1159. The lands, tenements and hereditaments of an insolvent
estate, decreed to be sold, shall be sold by the executor or adminis
trator, in the same manner, in all respects, as prescribed in this article,
for the sale of real estate, to pay the debts, when the personal estate
is insufficient; and the lands shall be liable, in the same way, for the
payment of the purchase money, and when the sale has been com
pleted, the executor or administrator shall make report thereof, in
writing, and under oath, and the court shall make its decree, in the
same manner, and with like effect, as prescribed for the sale of lands
to pay debts, on a deficiency of personal es,tate.
§ 1160. It shall be the duty of the executor or administrator to
sell the personal property of an insolvent estate, in the same manner
that such property is sold by executors or administrators in other
cases for the payment of debts.
§ 1161. When an estate is decreed insolvent, the court shall order
the executor or administrator to give three months' notice thereof, by
publishing such notice, in some newspaper printed in the county, or
in some convenient county, for four consecutive weeks, in which notice,
creditors shall be notified to come forward, and have their claims duly
probated and registered, in the register kept by the clerk ; and any
creditor who shall not register his claims, by the day stated in the order
of publication, not to be more than three months from the date of the
first publication, shall be forever barred ; and when the time for pre
senting claims has elapsed, the clerk shall make out a statement of
all the claims registered, specifying each claim, and the amount
thereof, for which service the court may make him a reasonable allow
ance, to be paid out of the estate; and the court shall thereupon

230

ADMINISTERING ESTATK3.

[Chap. 9.

cause notice to be published, in some newspaper printed in the state,
for at least three successive weeks, that at the next term, the claims
will be taken up, for examination and allowance, and that all creditors
are requested to attend ; and at the time appointed, the court shall pro
ceed carefully to examine into the validity of each claim, and may
require such as may seem doubtful, to be established by competent
evidence, and may reject, in whole or in part, any claim which is not
well founded ; and the executor or administrator, or any creditor, may
object to the allowance of any claim; and in case any such objections
be made, or if a claim be rejected, in whole or in part, by the court,
either party may claim to have referees appointed, whereupon the
court shall appoint three competent persons, to decide and re
port upon the validity of such claims, and the referees, so ap
pointed, may summon witnesses, and hear the parties and the
proof, and decide on the validity of the claim, for which service
the referees shall each receive three dollars per day, to be paid out of
the estate, if appointed at the instance of the administrator or execu
tor, or other creditor, and by the claimant, if appointed at his instance ;
and the witnesses shall be paid in the same way, the same fees and
mileage, that are allowed in the circuit courts. The referees shall re
port at the same term, if practicable, and if not, at the next succeed
ing term ; and their report shall be final and conclusive, unless it be
set aside for good cause shown, in which case a new reference shall be
made : provided, that creditors who have failed to present their
claims shall not be barred as to any surplus that remains after the
other debts, registered and allowed, have been fully paid.
§ 1162. When the claims are all registered and allowed, or estab
lished, and the amount of assets ascertained, the court shall proceed
to ascertain, through the clerk of the court, the pro rata share of each
creditor, deducting first the expenses incurred in the last sickness,
and funeral expenses, and court costs, and deducting from debts not
due the legal interest, from the time of payment up to the time of
their maturity ; but such deduction shall only be made on the amount
of the distributive share ; and when the distributive share of each
creditor is ascertained, the executor or administrator shall immediately
proceed to distribute all money in his hands amongst the respective
creditors, in proportion to their respective demands, and shall there
after continue to make such distributions, as money may come into
his hands from the estate, until the whole is distributed.
§ 1163. No suit or action, which may be pending against an exec
utor or administrator, at the time the estate is reported insolvent,
shall, on that account, abate, but may be prosecuted to final judg
ment; and the judgment shall constitute a claim against the estate,
though not registered as other claims, but shall have no priority over
general creditors ; and if any such suit be undetermined, when the
claims are to be examined and allowed by the court, and the distrib
utive shares ascertained and declared, such examination and allow
ance may be postponed until the suit is finally determined.

§ 1164. It shall be the duty of every executor and administrator,
within one year after the date of his appointment, and at least once
in each year thereafter, or oftener, if required by the court, to pre
sent to the court, or clerk in vacation, under oath, an account of his
administration, which account shall show the disbursements of the
executor or administrator, every item of which, and the amount
thereof, shall be distinctly stated, supported by a legal and proper
voucher, and it shall show the receipts of money, and from what
sources ; and the failure to account, annually, shall be a breach of the
administration bond, for which it may be immediately put in suit, or
the executor or administrator may be removed ; but the court may,
on application for that purpose, made within the year, and on good
cause shown, extend the time of accounting ; and it shall be the duty
of the chancery court, or the clerk in vacation, carefully to examine
all such accounts and accompanying vouchers, to see that they are
lawful and proper ; and if, on such examination, the court, or the
clerk, shall be satisfied that the account is just and true, it shall be
approved and allowed, as a correct annual settlement.
§ 1165. It shall be the duty of the court, at every term, to cause
a list to be made of all executors and administrators, who have failed
to settle their accounts within the year preceding ; and if there be
any such, the court shall order a summons to issue for such defaulter,
returnable forthwith, or at any subsequent term, or before the clerk,
in vacation, and on the return thereof, may proceed against such
executor or administrator, for a contempt, should he fail, promptly, to
make the required settlement.
§ 1166. When the estate has been fully administered, by payment
of all the debts, and the collection of all the money due, so far as the
same can be collected, it shall be the duty of the executor or admin
istrator to make a final settlement of the administration, by making
out, and filing in the office of the clerk, under oath, his final account,
which shall contain a distinct statement of all the balances of the
annual accounts, either as debits or credits, and also other charges,
disbursements and amounts received, and not contained in any pre
vious annual account.
§ 1167. The final account, so presented, shall be filed, and remain
subject to the inspection of any person interested ; and when the said
account is filed, the clerk shall issue citations, and make orders of
pubUcation, according to law, to all persons interested in the estate,
to appear at a term of the court, not less than one month from the
service of such notice, or the making of such publication, and show
cause, if any they can, why such account shall not be allowed, and
the administrator or executor discharged. Final accounts may also
be filed before the chancellor in term-time, and process and publica
tion ordered to the next term.
§ 1168. If any of the distributees or legatees be minors, or insane,
the process shall be served upon their guardians, and if they have no

232

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

guardian, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem, who shall have
full power to protect the interest of the minor.
§ 1169. If all process be returned executed, or if publication has
been made, and due proof thereof filed, the court shall, at the time
appointed, proceed to examine the final account so filed, and to hear
the proofs in support of it, and the objections and proofs against it;
and if the court shall, after full investigation, be satisfied that it is
just and true, it shall proceed to make a final approval and allowance,
satisfying and confirming the administration, and shall, at the same
time, order the executor or administrator to make immediate distribu
tion of all property in his hands.
§ 1170. If the court shall discover, either by the petition of any
person interested, or otherwise, that any executor or administrator
improperly delays making a final settlement, the court may order the
party to be summoned, to show cause why a final settlement should
not be made ; and, on the return of such summons executed, if a final
settlement be not made, or good cause shown why it cannot then be
made, the court may fine such delinquent, in any sum not exceeding
five hundred dollars, and imprison him, for a contempt, not exceeding
three months.
§ 1171 On the final settlement, the court shall make an allowance
to the executor or administrator, for property of the estate which has
been lost, or has perished, or decreased, without fault of the party,
and no profit shall be made by him in consequence of increase.
§ 1172. The court shall also allow to each executor or adminis
trator, as compensation for his trouble, either on partial or final settle
ments, not less than one, nor more than seven per centum, in the
whole, on the amount of the estate administered.
§ 1173. When any personal property of a deceased person, shall
not be susceptible of an equal division in kind, on account of the
nature of the property, the court may, on petition for that purpose,
by the executor or administrator, or other person interested, decree a
sale of such property, and order a distribution of the money arising
from such sale ; and such sale may be for cash, or on credit, as the
court may think best ; but all parties, interested as distributees or
legatees, shall be summoned before such decree is made, or cited by
publication, if non-residents of the state ; and such sale shall, in all
respects, be made as a sale of property, for the payment of debts,
and in like manner confirmed.
§ 1174. When any person, by last will and testament, shall devise
real estate to two or more devisees, not ascertaining or defining the
metes and bounds of each devisee's share, and one or more of the
devisees shall be under age, such devisees, or any of them, may apply
to the chancery court of the county in which the last will and testa
ment was proved and recorded, for a division of the real estate, to be
made according to the true intent of the will ; and the court may
order a division to be made, and the shares ascertained, by three or

Chap. 9.]

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

233

five disinterested freeholders, to be appointed for that purpose, who
shall discharge the duty, and make report to the court, which report,
or the report of a majority, made under their hands and seals, may be
approved by the court, and entered of record, and shall be final and
conclusive on all the parties concerned. And when the real estate of
any person dying intestate, shall descend to two or more children, or
other heirs, one or more of whom being under age, the court, on appli
cation, may order and direct a division of such real estate, agreeably
to the law of descents, the metes and bounds of each heir's share
to be ascertained and determined, by three or five disinterested free
holders of the county, to be appointed by the court for that purpose,
whose report, or the report of a majority of them, made under their
hands and seals, may be approved by the court, and entered of record,
and shall be conclusive on all parties concerned ; and, in either case,
the report of the freeholders shall bo made under oath ; but the de
visees, or heirs, or the guardians of such as are under age, residing in
this state, shall be first summoned, before any such decree and dis
tribution is made, and if any of them be non-residents, publication
shall be made, as in other cases.
§ 1175. Any person entitled to the distribution of an intestate's
estate, or to any legacy under the last will and testament, may at any
time after the expiration of twelve months from the time of granting
letters testamentary, or of administration, petition the chancery court
of the proper county, setting forth his claim ; whereupon, it shall be
the duty of the court, if, in its opinion, the same would be just and
proper, and for the best interests of all concerned, to grant a rule upon
the executor or administrator, to make the distribution according tolaw, or to pay the legacy, the executor or administrator having been
first summoned ; but no executor or administrator shall be compelled
to make distribution, or to pay any legacy, until bond and security
be given by the party applying therefor, to refund a due proportion
of any debts or demands which may afterwards appear against the
estate, and the costs attendant upon the recovery of such debts. But
the legatee or distributee shall not be required to give such bond,
after a final settlement of the estate by the executor or administrator,
and the distribution of personal estate shall be ordered and made in
the same manner, and subject to the same regulations, as real estate
which has descended ; and the commissioners appointed to divide the
land may also divide the personalty, and when there are no debts due
from the deceased, or if the court shall be satisfied that all debts have
been paid, distribution may be ordered, without administration.
§ 1176. Executors, administrators, and collectors, shall have full
power and authority to commence and prosecute any personal action
whatever,, at law or in equity, which the testator or intestate might
have commenced and prosecuted. And they shall also be liable to be
sued, in any court of law and equity, in any personal action which
might have been maintained against the deceased, and they shall be

234

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

entitled to, or be answerable for costs, in the same manner as the
deceased would have been, and shall be allowed for the same in their
accounts, if the court awarding costs against them shall certify that
there were probable grounds for instituting, prosecuting or defending
the action on which the judgment or decree shall have been given
against them. And they may also maintain any action or suit, which
may accrue to them in due course of administration, on any contract
which they are authorized to make as such, or for the recovery of
the personal property, or for injuries thereto.
§ 1177. When there are two or more administrators on an estate,
and one or more of them takes all or the greater part of such estate,
and refuses to pay the debts or funeral expenses of the deceased, or
to account with the other administrators, in such case, the aggrieved
administrator may have his action of account against the other, and
recover such proportionate share of the estate as he may be entitled
to. And any executor, being a residuary legatee, may have an action
of account against his co-executor, to recover his part of the estate
and any other residuary legatee may have a like remedy against the
executors. And any person having a legacy bequeathed, in any last
will and testament, may sue for, and recover the same, by action
at law.
§ 1178. All personal actions which have been commenced and
prosecuted, for or against the executor or administrator of such testa
tor or intestate, shall survive, for or against the executor or administra
tor of such testator or intestate, with the same effect that they might or
could have been had or maintained, for or against the testator or intes
tate ; provided, that in assessing damages, the jury shall only render
a verdict for the amount the plaintiff may prove that he or she ac
tually sustained, and vindictive damages shall not be given.
§ 1179. If any bond, given by an executor, administrator or col
lector, under this article, be forfeited, the chancellor shall cause the
same to be put in suit, and prosecuted, at the request of any party
aggrieved by such forfeiture ; and the money recovered on such bond,
shall be applied towards making good the damages sustained by the
breach of the condition, in such manner as the court, by its sentence
or decree, shall direct.
§ 1180. Any parties interested in an estate, either as legatees, dis
tributees or creditors, may, either jointly or severally, institute pro
ceedings, upon the bond of the executor or administrator, for a de
vastavit, against the principal and his sureties, in the first instance,
without first having instituted suit against the executor or adminis
trator, to establish a devastavit.
§ 1181. No suit or action, commenced by or against an adminis
trator ad colligendum, shall abate by the termination of his authority,
but the executor or administrator may come in, voluntarily, and by
proper suggestion, make himself a party, or if he fail to do so, he may
be brought in by the opposite party, by scire facias, and all judgments

recovered by or against such administrator ad colligendum, may bo
revived for or against his successor, in the same way.
§ 1182. If any executor or administrator should die, resign or be
removed, or his functions should cease from any cause, before the es
tate is finally settled, suits or actions commenced by or against such
executor or administrator shall not for that reason abate, but the same
may be prosecuted by or against his successor in the administration,
who may come in and make himself a party to suits or actions com
menced by or against his predecessor, by proper suggestion, or if he
fail to do so. he may be brought in by the opposite party by scire
facias, and all judgments recovered by or against any executor or
administrator who has died, resigned, or been removed, may be revived
for or against his successor, in the same way.
§ 1183. Executors, administrators and collectors shall not be
bound to plead specially to any action or suit at law, brought against
them in their representative capacity, but they may give any special
matter in evidence under the general issue, and no executor or adminis
trator, or the sureties on their bonds, shall be chargeable beyond the
amount of the assets of the testator or intestate, by reason of any
mistake or omission, or false pleading of such executor or adminis
trator.
§ 1184. No suit or action shall be brought against any executor or
administrator, in such capacity, until after the expiration of six months
from the date of the letters testamentary or of administration.
§ 1185. If any person shall alienate or embezzle any of the goods, chat
tels, personal property, or money of a person deceased, before taking
out letters testamentary or of administration, and before a true in
ventory is exhibited, such person shall stand chargeable, and be liable,
to the action of the creditors and other persons aggrieved, as being
executor in his own wrong.
§ 1186. No executor or administrator shall remove any of the
property of the estate of which he has charge, out of the limits of this
state. And in case of any such removal, it shall be the duty of the
chancellor forthwith to cause the bond to be sued on, for the use of
the distributees or creditors, against such executor or administrator
and his sureties; and the jury trying such cause, on satisfactory evi
dence of the removal of property out of the state, shall render a ver
dict against the defendants, for the full value thereof, and such other
damages as the parties shall have sustained.
§ 1187. If any chancellor shall be satisfied, by petition or other
wise, in term-time or vacation, that any executor or administrator,
within his jurisdiction, is about to remove the property of the estate,
out of this state, it shall be the duty of such chancellor to issue a pre
cept to the sheriff of the proper county, commanding him to seize the
property about to be removed, and to hold the same in his possession,
until legally disposed of, and the letters of such executor or adminis

236

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

[Chap. 9.

trator, shall be revoked, unless, after due notice, such executor or ad
ministrator shall show that such removal was not in fact designed.
§ 1188. If letters testamentary, or of administration, should be
granted by any chancery court in this state, to any person not a resi
dent thereof, or if any executor or administrator, after his appoint
ment, should remove out of this state, and if such executor or admin
istrator, residing or removing out of the state, shall refuse or neglect
to settle his accounts, annually, or neglect the due administration
thereof, in other respects, the court, after publication made, and proof
thereof, as in other cases, shall revoke the letter of such executor or
administrator, and proceed to grant administration de bonis non, as if
such executor or administrator had died or resigned.
§ 1189. Executors and administrators, who have qualified in other
states, may sue, as such, in the courts of this state, if they shall file their
letters and bond, or duly certified copies, in the chancery court of
the proper county, and shall also file therewith, a certificate from the
court in which the letters were granted, that the property or debt to
be sued for in this state, is included in the inventory of such executor
or administrator, in the court where the letters were granted, or that
he is there liable for the subject matter of such suit.
§ 1190. When costs are adjudged against an executor or adminis
trator, in any suit of law or in equity, and he shall obtain the certifi
cate of the court before which the suit was tried, that there was
probable cause for bringing or defending the same, he shall not be in
dividually liable for costs, although the estate may be insufficient to
pay them.
§ 1191. The executor or administrator of an executor, de son tort,
shall be liable to a recovery, to the extent of the value of the prop
erty received, or held by such executor de son tort, if sufficient assets
shall have been received to pay the same ; and any one who may
have become liable as executor de son tort, in any other state, and
has established his residence in this state, shall be liable to be sued
in this state, as such, by any creditor, legatee or distributee, either at
law or in equity, as the nature of the case may require.
§ 1192. When there are two or more executors or administrators,
if process cannot be -served on all of them, in suits against them,
service on one shall be sufficient to authorize a judgment against all ;
and, if necessary, a special administrator may be appointed, to insti
tute and conduct suits, whose power shall cease when the litigation
is entirely closed, and who shall only account for the proceeds of
the suit.
§ 1193. Every administrator de bonis non shall be entitled to all
choses in action, taken or held by any former executor or adminis
trator, in his official capacity, and may institute suit for the same,
and, if necessary, enjoin the previous executor or administrator from
collecting the same.
§ 1194. Whenever any last will and testament shall empower and

Chap. 9.]

ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

237

direct the executor, as to the sale of property, the payment of debts
and legacies, and the management of the estate, the directions of the
will shall be followed by the executor; aud no provision herein con.
tained shall so operate as to require the executor to pursue a different
course from that prescribed in the will, if it be lawful ; and if land be
devised to be sold, the sale shall be made, and the proper conveyance
executed, by the executors, or such of them as shall undertake the
execution of the will, or by the person appointed by the will to exe
cute the trust ; and if the executor should fail to qualify, or should
die before he executes the will, and if the person appointed should
fail to execute the trust, the sale shall be made by the administrator
with the will annexed.
§ 1195. If any person shall sell lands, tenements, or heredita
ments, and enter into bond, or other agreement, to make title at a
future day, and shall die before the title is made, then the person to
whom the bond was given, or his heirs or assigns, may petition the
chancery court, which granted the letters on the estate of the obligor,
for an order on the executor or administrator of the obligor, to make
title agreeably to the bond or other instrument ; and it shall be the
duty of the court, to order a summons for the parties interested, or
publication, if they be non-residents, which process shall be served,
or publication made, as in other cases ; and on the return of the pro
cess, the court shall proceed to hear the petition and proofs, and if
satisfied that the title should be made, shall make a decree that the
executor or administrator make title, according to the bond or agree
ment, which title, the executor or administrator shall accordingly
make, or on refusal to do so, may be punished for a contempt, provided
that either party dissatisfied with the decree of the court, may take
an appeal, as in other cases.
§ 1196. Whenever any person shall have purchased land, and shall
die before the payment therefor is completed, the chancery court of
the proper county, may order and direct the sale of personal property,
as in other cases, for the payment of the debt due for the land, on
such terms as the court may prescribe, the proceeds to be applied to
such payment. Or, if in the opinion of the court, the personal
property will njot be sufficient, if sold, to pay for the land, or if it should
be deemed advisable that the interest of the deceased, in the land,
be sold, in preference to selling personal property, to make payment
therefor, then, in either case, the court may order the sale of such land
or the interest of the deceased therein, on such terms and conditions
as it may think proper, all parties interested being first summoned.
§ 1197. Whenever a chancery court, in settling the affairs of an
estate, shall order an executor or administrator to sell lands for the
payment of debts, or for division of the proceeds amongst heirs or
legatees, or for any other purpose, the court shall, before such decree
is entered, take from the person ordered to make such sale, a bond,
with good security, in a penalty at least equal to the estimated value

238

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

[Chap. 9.

of the land ordered to be sold, and conditioned that the proceeds of
such sale shall be faithfully applied, according to law and the decree
of the court, such bond to be payable as administrators' bonds are,
and carefully preserved in the clerk's office.
§ 1198. It shall be the duty of executors and administrators
speedily to settle the affairs of the estates in their hands, and as soon
as possible submit their final settlements; and if there be any default
in this respect, the court shall cite the defaulter to appear and show
cause why he does not close the administration. If he fail to obey
the orders of the court, he shall be dealt with, as in other cases of
contempt.
§ 1199. In contests, in reference to the establishment of wills, the
chancellor shall have power, and it is made his duty, to cause the
proper issue to be formed, and to cause a jury to be summoned and
empaneled in his court to try the same, such jury to be summoned
from the citizens of the county where the issue is tried, and to be
empaneled, sworn and paid, according to the rules established in civil
proceedings in the circuit court.

ARTICLE X.

PROCEEDINGS IN MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.
§ 1200. The chancery courts of this state shall have sole and exclu
sive jurisdiction to grant letters of guardianship over the persons and
estates of all minors residing in said state.
§ 1201. Letters of guardianship shall be applied for and granted
in that county in which the minor may actually reside, at the time of
such application.
§ 1202. Minors whose parents, or either of them, may be alive,
and who are possessed of property, real or personal, in their own
right, shall have guardians appointed for them over their estates (but
not over their persons), by the chancellors of the counties in whicli
such minors reside. In making appointments of guardians, the court
shall, in all cases, prefer the father, if living, and if he be dead, the
mother, unless it should appear that such parents are disqualified or
unfit for the office of guardian, in which event some other suitable
person shall be selected.
§ 1203. Any father, whether twenty-one years of age or not, may,
during his life time, appoint a guardian over the person and estate of
his unmarried minor child, by writing, or by his last will and testa
ment, executed according to law. He may do this, although the child
be not born.
§ 1204. Such an appointment of guardian shall confer all the

Chap. 9.]

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

239

powers, duties and responsibilities upon the guardian which arise
under the common law and this article, in reference to other guar
dians, after such guardian shall have qualified according to law, and
received his letters ; but when the deed or will expressly dispenses
with bond and security, or either, none shall be required by the court.
§ 1205. The clerks of the chancery courts, in the different counties,
in vacation, shall have power to issue letters of guardianship accord
ing to the directions and requirements of this article, subject, as in
other cases, to the control of the court in term time.
§ 1206. Every guardian, appointed by the chancellor or clerk,
before letters are issued to him, shall execute and file in the proper
office a sufficient bond, payable to the State of Mississippi, with good
and sufficient security, to be approved by the court or clerk, in such
penalty as the court or clerk may fix, in view of the condition and
value of the estate, the condition of which bond shall be in substance
as follows:
" The condition of the above obligation is, that if the above bounden
, as guardian to
, of
county, shall faithfully discharge all
the duties required of him by law, and shall faithfully account with
the chancery court of
county, for the management of the prop
erty and estate of the minor under his care, and shall also deliver up
said property, with its increase and profits, agreeably to the order of
said court, or the directions of law, and shall, in all respects, perform
the duty of guardian to the said
, then the above obligation shall
cease, otherwise it shall remain in full force and virtue in law."
§ 1207. Such bond may be sued upon, by order of the proper chan
cellor, for any breach of the condition thereof, by the guardian whilst
acting, or by the minor after attaining the age of majority.
§ 1208. Every guardian, before his appointment, shall take an oath
in open court, or before the clerk in vacation, that he will faithfully
execute his duties, as guardian, according to law and the directions of
the court.
§ 1209. On the guardian's qualifying as above directed, the court
shall have power, and it shall be its duty, to make a decree or order
that the land, distributive shares, or other property belonging to such
ward, be delivered to the guardian immediately, or at such time as
shall appear reasonable ; in case of a legacy or bequest, the court
shall direct the delivery to be made as soon as it may appear that the
same may be delivered without prejudice to the person administering
the estate, and in case of a distributive share, the court shall direct a
delivery as soon as the same shall be ascertained, and distribution be
made according to law, the guardian to execute a refunding bond, if
the estate has not been finally settled. And on failure of any former
guardian or of an executor or administrator to comply with such order
or decree, his bond may be put in suit, or he may be attached, fined
and imprisoned for a contempt, process being first served on him, as in
other cases.

240

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

[Chap. 9.

1210. The chancery court of any county, by which a guardian was
appointed, may, for good and sufficient cause, remove any guardian,
after having given him five days' notice to appear at court, and show
cause against such removal.
1211. Should the sureties of any guardian become insufficient at
any time, or be in failing or dubious circumstances, and the chan
cellor have knowledge thereof, it shall be his duty at once to summon
the guardian to appear and give a new bond with good security. If
the guardian fail to comply with such order, within a reasonable time,
to be named by the chancellor, his letters shall be revoked, and the
guardianship conferred upon some suitable person who will accept
the trust and qualify.
1212. The sureties of any guardian, who apprehend danger of
pecuniary loss by reason of such suretyship, may apply to the chan
cellor having jurisdiction, by petition, and on convincing the chan
cellor, in term-time, that such danger really exists, an order shall be
made requiring such guardian to give another bond, within a reasona
ble time, to be named by the court, in default of which, he shall
be removed from office, and another guardian appointed. If the
new bond be given, the sureties on the former bond shall not be liable
thereon, except as to all acts of the guardian up to the time of exe
cuting the new bond ; provided, that such guardian shall have five
days7 notice in writing, of the time and place of such application.
§ 1213. If the chancellor should, at any time, in term-time or
vacation, be satisfied by petition, verified, or have good reason to
believe, on information, that any guardian is about to remove the
property of his ward, unlawfully, out of this state, the said chancellor,
having jurisdiction over the guardian, shall forthwith cause to be
issued to the proper officer a precept, directing him to seize such
property and safely keep the same until another order to the contrary,
and to summons the guardian, if to be found, to appear before the
court and answer such charge. When the guardian appears, or if he
make default, the chancellor may, in his discretion, revoke his letters,
and appoint another guardian in his place.
§ 1214. Every guardian in this state shall return inventories of
money, debts, and the property of his ward, (both real and personal),
and make settlements with the court, according to the requirements
made in this chapter, in reference to the settlements and inventories
of administrators, executors and collectors ; and he shall annually re
port to court, any increase in the stock or property of his ward, and
any loss therein.
§ 1215. The annual settlements of a guardian, shall show his ex
penses, in detail, in supporting his ward, and all his receipts, and shall
be supported by proper and satisfactory vouchers ; and his annual
settlements may be made before the clerk, in vacation, subject to the
supervision and control of the chancellor, in term-time; and such

Chap. 9.J

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

241

settlements shall be made at the times, and in the manner directed
herein, in reference to executors and administrators.
§ 1216. The expenditures of a guardian, in supporting and edu
cating his ward, shall not exceed, in any year, the annual income of
the estate, unless by authority of the chancellor, on a showing that
the income of the ward will not properly support and educate him ;
when an order shall be made, authorizing the income to be trans
cended, to any extent necessary for the proper support and education
of the ward.
§ 1217. For no balance of money in his hands, necessary for the
support and education of his ward, during the year, shall a guardian
be chargeable with interest; but when funds accumulate, over and
above the requirements for the support of the ward, the court shall
order such surplus funds to be loaned at interest, on good mortgage
or personal security ; and the chancellor shall, in all cases, see that
the security is ample and undoubted.
§ 1218. The powers and duties of every testamentary, or other
guardian, over the person and estate of his ward, shall cease and be
determined, when such ward shall either arrive at the age of twentyone years, or be lawfully married ; and in either event, the guardian
shall forthwith deliver to the ward, or to the husband, as the case may
require, all the property, of every description, of said ward, in his
hands, and on failure, shall be liable to an action on his bond; and
the guardian shall also make a final settlement of his guardianship,
by making out, and presenting to the clerk in vacation, or to the
court, his final account, under oath, containing a statement of all the
balances of his preceding accounts, debit and credit, and also all the
receipts and expenditures not contained in any preceding account.
When the final account is presented to the clerk in v acation, he shall
issue a summons for the ward, to the next term, or make publication
as the case may be, returnable to the next term: provided, there be
one month between such service and publication, and the commence
ment of such term, and the account shall remain on file, for inspection,
until the same is finally settled. If the account be filed in term-time,
it shall be heard at the next succeeding term, if the ward has been
summoned, or publication made, unless good cause be shown for a
continuance. The summons or publication, shall notify the ward of
the filing of the account, and state when it comes up for hearing, and
inform him of his right to appear and contest the same. At the
appointed time, unless continued for cause, the court shall proceed to
examine the account, and to hear all the parties interested ; and if,
after examination, the court should find the amount correct, it shall
decree that the same be confirmed. The court may allow, or disallow,
such parts of the account as may seem just and proper. The court
shall also allow the guardian fair compensation for his services, not to
exceed seven per centum on the value of the estate ; and shall also
decree that the property and effects of the ward be delivered to him,
16

242

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

[CHAP. 9.

if that has not been done, and that the guardian be discharged.
Guardians may resign their trusts, in the same manner in which
administrators and executors may resign.
§ 1219. No guardian shall commit waste on the lands, tenements or
hereditaments of his ward ; but the court may allow him to sell wood
or timber, and account for the same, in case it shall be deemed neces
sary or advantageous for the ward's education or maintenance, and
any guardian, having real estate under his care, shall either cultivate
the same with the stock and utensils belonging to the ward, or to be
purchased with his money, with the permission of the court, or he
may lease the same from year to year, or for any time not exceeding
three years, if the ward will not sooner be of age ; but no guardian
shall be answerable for any loss or decrease sustained without his
fault.
§ 1120. The chancery court shall, at discretion, settle the sum to
be expended in the maintenance and education of minors, having re
gard to the future situation, prospects and destination of the minor;
and if it shall deem it advantageous to the ward, may allow the guar
dian to exceed the income of the estate, or if necessary, may order a
sale of so much of the personal estate as may be requisite for the
purposes aforesaid ; and if the personal estate and the rents and
profits of the real estate, be not sufficient for the maintenance and
education of the ward, the court may, on full investigation, authorize
and order the guardian to sell such part of the lands, tenements and
hereditaments of the ward, as may be necessary for his maintenance
and education ; the sale to be made as hereinafter provided for other
sales of land by guardians, or if it should be deemed most advan
tageous to the interests of the ward, the court may order the sale of
real estate, in preference to the sale of personal estate, in the first
instance.
§ 1121. When any guardian shall think that it would be for the
interest of his ward to sell a part, or the whole, of the real or personal
estate of his ward, such guardian may present a petition to the chan
cery court, of the proper county, setting forth fully, the reason why a
sale of the lands would be beneficial to the ward, which shall be veri
fied by oath, and shall be presented to the court, at least one month
before a decree of sale can be made, and the court shall appoint a day
at the next term, for hearing the petition, and shall order a summons
to issue for co-heirs, if there be any, and also, to at least two of the
nearest relations of the minor, if there be any in the state ; and if
the process be served, the court, at the time appointed, shall proceed
to hear and examine the allegations and proofs of the guardian, and
also those who may appear and object, if there be any such ; and if,
on such hearing, the court shall be satisfied that the interests of the
minor would be promoted by a sale of the lands mentioned in the
petition, and that there is no valid objection to such sale, it may pro
ceed to make a decree of sale, in which shall be stated the reasons on
which it was made, and the court may also prescribe the terms and

Chap. 9.]

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

243

conditions of sale, the notice which shall be requisite, and shall also
require the guardian to give an additional bond and security, faithfully
to account for the proceeds of sale.
§ 1222. At the time appointed, the guardian shall proceed to sell
the land, in the manner and on the terms prescribed in the decree of
the court, and shall make a report thereof, in writing, stating the time
and place of sale, the name of the purchaser, and the amount of the
purchase money ; and shall also satisfy the court, that the directions
prescribed in the decree of sale, have been followed ; and thereupon,
the court may proceed to make a decree confirming the sale, unless
good cause be shown to the contrary ; and the court shall, moreover,
order the guardian to make title to the purchaser of the lands, tene
ments and hereditaments so sold ; and the conveyance shall vest in
the purchaser, as good and perfect an estate, in the premises therein
described, as the ward had ; but the land, and all personal property
sold by guardians, shall be held liable, and subject to a lien, for
the payment of the purchase money, as if a mortgage had been exe
cuted by the purchaser, and had been duly registered ; and such lien
shall continue, until an acknowledgment of satisfaction be entered of
record, in the chancery court ; and no guardian shall, either directly
or indirectly, become a purchaser at his own sale.
§ 1223. When lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall descend,
or be devised to heirs or devisees jointly, one or more of whom are
minors, and an equal division thereof cannot conveniently be made,
the guardian of such minor may apply, by bill or petition, to the chan
cery court of the county in which the letters were granted, for an
order to sell his ward's share or interest in the land, and the court,
after summoning the co-heirs, or co-devisees, may proceed to hear
such application, and if it should deem it proper, may make a decree
of sale of the ward's interest, as in other applications for the sale of
real estate by guardians, and the sale and report thereof shall be
made in like manner, subject to all provisions of other sales made by
guardians, or the court may order the whole of such real estate to be
sold, and the proceeds to be divided among, and secured to, the per
sons entitled thereto.
§ 1224. The chancery courts may, on the application of guardians
appointed by them respectively, authorize such guardian to purchase
real estate for his ward out of any surplus funds in hand belonging to
the ward, if the court shall be of opinion that it will promote the
interests of the ward ; and in such case the guardian shall be required
to take good and sufficient titles, in the name of the ward, to be
approved by the court, and recorded in the proper county. Said court
may, also, in like manner, cause to be completed the payment due on
any lands descended to a minor, by the sale of real or personal
property of the minor, or, if deemed advisable, the ward's interest
in lands not fully paid for may be sold.
§ 1225. Should a non-resident minor own real or personal property

244

MATTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

[Chap. 9.

in this state, and if a guardian has been appointed for such minor iir
the state of his residence, such foreign guardian shall be entitled to
receive letters of guardianship in the chancery court of any county in
this state, in which such property may be situate : provided, he
exhibits a duly certified copy of the record of his appointment
abroad, and gives bond here, as in other cases of guardianship.
§ 1226. If any such non-resident guardian should desire to remove
the personal property of his ward out of this state, he shall present
his petition for that purpose to the chancery court by which he was
appointed, and on making a final settlement of his guardianship
* accounts, the court may, if it should deem it proper, make an order
to that effect ; but the guardian shall first give bond, with two good
securities, residing in this state, in the full value of the ward's personal
estate, conditioned that he will present to the court, in the state of his
residence, by which he was originally appointed, a full and complete
inventory of the property and effects of the ward, to be removed from
this state ; and on failure to comply with the condition, the bond may
be put in suit, for the benefit of the ward, and a certified copy shall
be admissible in evidence.
§ 1227. When such guardian shall present to the court here, a duly
certified copy of an inventory, filed in the county where letters
were originally granted, showing that all the property and effects
received here have been duly reported and accounted for, the court
here shall cause his bond to be canceled, and himself discharged from
further accountability.
§ 1228. If any guardian shall desire to remove the person, or per
sonal property of his ward, to any county in this state, other than that
in which he was appointed guardian, he may, on his petition for that
purpose, be allowed to do so, if the court should deem it proper, and
it may make an order to that effect, on condition that the guardian
will qualify as such in the county to which he removes ; and the court
of that county, on production of the order authorizing the removal,
may appoint him guardian ; and when ho shall produce to the court,
which originally appointed him, the letters of guardianship from the
court of the county to which he has removed, and shall also make a
final settlement of his guardianship accounts, he may be discharged
from his original bond; and thereafter he shall present his inventories
and accounts to, and be under the control of, the court of the county
to which he has removed ; and it shall be the duty of the clerk of the
court where such final settlement is made, to send a certified copy of
the record of such settlement, at the cost of the guardian, to the
court where such guardian was last appointed, together with a certified
copy of all proceedings, up to the time of changing the guardianship.
§ 1229. Should any guardian desire to remove the person and per
sonal property of his ward out of this state into any other state, on his
petition for that purpose, and on his making final settlement of his
guardianship accounts, the court which appointed him, may, if it

245

should deem it proper, make an order to that effect; but the guardian
shall first give bond, with two good securities residing in this state, in
the full value of the ward's personal estate, conditioned that he will
qualify as guardian to the ward in the state to which he intends re
moving, and will there present and file in the proper court, a full and
complete inventory of his ward's property and effects of every descrip
tion ; and on failure to comply with the condition, the bond may be
put in suit for the benefit of the ward, and a certified copy shall be
evidence. But if the guardian shall comply with the condition, and
shall produce to the court in this state, a certificate to that effect, from
the court in whic"h he qualified, duly authenticated, and shall also pre
sent to the court here, a duly certified copy of the inventory presented
and filed, then the court, if satisfied of the correctness of the invent
ory, may cause satisfaction of the bond to be entered of record, and
may also then make an order discharging him from his original bond,
if the ward had none other than personal estate, or if the real estate
has been sold.
§ 1230. Whenever a minor residing out of this state shall be en
titled to receive any legacy or distributive share of an estate admin
istered here, or any debt of any description, his guardian, appointed
abroad, shall be entitled to receive or sue for the same in this state,
on producing to the chancery court of any county in this state,
where the person may be who holds such funds or effects in his hands,
or owes such debts, record of evidence of the appointment of such
person as guardian in the state or county where such minor resides,
with evidence that such guardian hath given bond and qualified ac
cording to the laws of the state where he was appointed. The court
hereafter receiving such proof, and having .duly cited the person hold
ing such money or effects to appear and contest the authority of such
guardian, may order the same to be paid or delivered ; and this order
shall be a good acquittance to the person thus paying such funds or
delivering such effects. A voluntary payment of a debt or legacy, or
distributive share, made by the person owing or holding the same in
this state, on the exhibition of the documentary evidence above
named, shall be good, but shall, in all cases, be at the risk of the per
son making such payment or delivering such legacy or distributive
share.
§ 1231. Guardians of minors and persons non compos mentis, may
be empowered by the court to sell or compromise claims due their
wards, on the same terms prescribed in article IX of this chapter in
reference, to claims due estates of deceased persons.
§ 1232. Minors over the age of fourteen years, shall have power
to choose guardians for themselves. This shall be done by a written
petition, signed and acknowledged before the chancellor, or the clerk
of the court, or some justice of the peace of the state. The guar
dian may be appointed by the clerk in vacation, or by the chancellor
in term-time, according to the general mode for qualification pre

[Chap. 9.

scribed in other cases of guardianship. Should such minors elect any
guardian other than the natural guardian, the chancellor or clerk shall
have power to appoint the natural guardian, if he is more suitable
for the trust. Should a minor aged fourteen years and upwards select
a guardian manifestly unfit for the place, the chancellor or clerk shall
not be bound to make the appointment; and if any minor aged four
teen years, having property or effects in the county, shall fail to ap
pear and choose a guardian, the chancellor shall summons him to
appear and make the selection, and if he fail to do so, the court shall
appoint some suitable person, preferring the next of kin, if qualified.

ARTICLE XI.

§ 1233. The chancery courts, sitting in each county of this state,
and the chancellors in vacation, shall have sole power to grant letters

son of unsound mind actually resides at the time.
§ 1234. On the application to such court, or the chancellor in
vacation, of any relative or friend of such person, or on the applica
tion of the board of supervisors, made in writing, and filed, it shall
be the duty of the court or chancellor, to direct the clerk forthwith to
issue to the sheriff of the proper county, a writ, commanding him to
summons, without delay, a jury of twelve good and lawful men, to
assemble at some convenient point in the county, to make inquiry as
to the existence of such alleged unsoundness of mind ; none of the
members of such jury shall be of kin to the party alleged to be men
tally incompetent, nor shall any of them be interested in the estate
of such person.
§ 1235. When the jury are empaneled by the sheriff, some com
petent officer shall administer to them an oath, well and truly to
inquire, on all the evidence brought before them, whether the party
named in the writ be mentally incapable of taking proper care of
himself or his estate, or not.
§ 1236. The jury may, if they wish, have the party alleged to be
of unsound mind brought before them. They shall take the state

produced. They shall also take the opinion, under oath, of such
medical men of the vicinage, as can conveniently be brought before
them.
§ 1237. The sheriff, by himself or deputy, shall attend upon such

Chap. 9.]

juries, and execute and return all subpoenas or attachments for wit
nesses, which subpoenas or attachments, the foreman of the jury shall
have power to issue.
§ 1238. It shall not be required that the whole jury shall concur

another jury empaneled, as hereinbefore provided.
§ 1239. The verdict of the jury shall be written on the process,
and signed by all the jury who concur therein ; and the writ and ver
dict, and all the papers in the cause, shall be immediately returned to

inquired of is of sound mind, and capable of managing his business,
then all further proceedings shall cease, and the person causing the
inquiry to be made shall be taxed with all the costs, for which the
clerk of the court may issue process offi. fa., according to law.
§ 1241. If the jury, or a majority of them, should pronounce such
person unsound in mind, and incapable of managing his affairs, the
court, or chancellor in vacation, shall appoint some discreet and
qualified person guardian of the person and estate of such lunatic or
idiot, or person non compos mentis; the nearest relations of such
person, if competent, shall have preference, and such appointment
shall be made, in all respects, as guardians to minors are required by
this chapter to be appointed.
§ 1242. The guardians, when appointed, shall proceed in adminis
tering and managing the estate of such person, in reference to inven
tories, settlements, and all other matters, as guardians to minors are
required by law to proceed.
§ 1243. The respective chancery courts shall have the same power
and control of guardians appointed under this article as they have
over guardians to minors ; they shall have the same powers in refer
ence to sales of property, compromising claims, regulating expenses,
and the general management of the estates of persons non compos
mentis, which they have over the estates and guardians of minors, and
shall, whenever it may be necessary and proper, apply those laws to
the management of the estates of persons non compos mentis.
§1244. It shall be the duty of such guardians, under the direction
of the court, to provide for the comfortable support of the idiot,
lunatic, or person non compos mentis, and his family; to preserve and
manage the estate carefully and frugally; to see that the children be
educated; to pay all just pre-existing debts, contracted whilst he was
sane, and if the product of the estate will not suffice for such pur
poses, so to report to the court, and to ask for orders to sell property.
§ 1245. Such guardians shall have the same power to prosecute
and defend suits at law, and in equity, which would appertain to the
person committed to their charge, were he sound in mind.

248

APPEALS.

[Chap. 9.

ever the person committed to his charge shall have been restored to
reason, and this shall be ascertained, by the chancellor taking evi
dence and investigating the matter; and whenever it shall be made
clear to the chancellor, that reason has been restored, and that the
party is capable of managing his own affairs, he shall cause the guar
dian to make his final settlement, as guardians to minors are required
to settle ; and after allowing such guardian fair and reasonable com
pensation, for his labor and services, cause the letters of guardianship
to be surrendered, and all the property and effects, and all the net
profits, to be restored to the party entitled to the same.
§ 1247. The clerks of the chancery courts, in the respective coun
ties of the state, shall have power, in vacation, on the order of the
chancellor, to issue letters of guardianship, and warrants of appraise
ment, under the provisions of this article, and receive and examine
the annual accounts of such guardians, and grant orders for the sale
of personalty, where it may be necessary to sell the same, subject, as
in other cases, to the supervision of the chancellors.
§ 1248. Should the chancellor become satisfied that it is necessary
and advisable to confine such person to the lunatic asylum of the
state, he shall so order and direct, and provide, if possible, from the
estate of such person, a sufficient sum to defray the expenses ; and
the certificate of the clerk of the chancery court, with the seal of the
court attached, shall be sufficient evidence to the superintendent of
the asylum to receive such person.

will of my husband, exhibited and proved, according to law. And I
elect to take, in lieu thereof, my dower, or legal share of the estate of
my said husband, A. B." But by renouncing all claim to a bequest,
or bequest of personal property, made to her by the will of her hus
band, she shall only be entitled to her legal share of the personal
estate of her husband, which shall remain after the payment of his
just debts, and claims against him.
§ 1288. If the will of the husband devise a part of both real and
personal estate, the widow shall renounce the whole, or be otherwise
barred of her right to both the real and personal estate ; but if the

real estate, as the case may be : provided, that if the devise of the
real or personal estate, or both, shall be expressly in lieu of her legal
share, in one or in both, she shall accordingly be barred, unless she
renounce, as aforesaid ; but if, in effect, nothing shall pass by such
devise, she shall not be thereby barred, whether she shall, or shall

in such cases, a summons shall be served on the widow, as well as
other persons interested, and the court shall hear the petition, and

married women, but the two acts shall be construed together, in this
respect, as one law.

mary way, without pleadings in writing, at the first term, unless cause
can be shown for a continuance; provided, that, if it shall appear on
the trial of such appeal, that the suit was brought before a justice of
the peace not having jurisdiction thereof, the circuit court shall re

giving bond, with security, as in cases of appeal from justices of the
peace ; and in any cause removed by certiorari under this act, the

be bound by such attachment from the date of the service thereof;
if the defendant can be found, the said officer shall also summon him
to appear and answer the action.
§ 1435. Every writ of attachment shall be executed in the fol
lowing manner, that is to say, in case of a levy on real estate, the
officer shall go to the house or land of the defendant, or to the person
or house of the person in whose possession the same may be, and
then and there shall declare that he attaches the same, at the suit of
the plaintiff in the said writ named. But in the event the land is
wild, uncultivated or unoccupied, a return upon the writ, by the
proper officer, that he has attached the land, giving a description there
of by numbers, metes and bounds, or otherwise, shall be a sufficient
levy, without going upon the land. In case of a levy on the stock,
share or interest of the defendant in any copartnership or incorpor
ated company, the officer shall go to the office or place of business of
such partnership or company, and in the presence of such officers,
clerks, or agents thereof as may be present, shall make a similar
declaration as in the case of real estate. In case of a levy on the
rights, credits, and choses in action of the defendant, the officer shall
seize and take into possession the books of account and all other evi
dences of indebtedness, if the same can be had, and shall summon all
persons alleged to be indebted to the defendant, or to have effect of
said defendant in their hands, to appear and answer as garnishees ;
and in case of a levy on money, goods or chattels of the defendant,
the officer shall take the property into possession, and safely keep the
same, to answer and abide the judgment of the court, unless such

third person as may have the same in possession shall enter into bond
with security to he approved by the said officer, payable to the plaintiff
in attachment, in double the value of the property attached, condi
tioned to have said property forthcoming to answer and abide the
judgment of the court in said suit.
§ 1436. The officer serving an attachment, shall make a full re
turn thereon of all his proceedings, on or before the return day of the
writ. He shall deliver to the court or clerk all bonds which he may have
taken pursuant to law.
§ 1437. If a writ of attachment, returnable to the circuit court,
be served by a constable or coroner, or marshal of a city, or by any
other person specially appointed for that purpose, the writ of attach
ment, with the return thereon, and all property and effects levied on,
shall forthwith be handed to the sheriff of the proper county, who
shall be responsible for the property so seized, unless such sheriff
should be a party, in which event, the officer serving the attachment,
shall make the return, and likewise retain the property, unless the
court, or judge, in vacation, shall make some order for the safe
keeping and forthcoming thereof.
§ 143S. Any officer to whom a writ of attachment may bo de
livered, may, either before or after serving the same, demand of the
plaintiff, or his agent or at torney, a bond of indemnity, to save him
harmless from all claimants of the property seized, or to be seized,
under such writ.

U0W PROPERTY MAY BE REPLEVIED.
§ 1439. The defendant, at any time before final judgment, may re
plevy the personal property seized, and taken into possession by the
officer serving an attachment, by giving to such officer a bond, with
sufficient security, to be approved by him, payable to the plaintiff, in
double the value of such property, conditioned to have said property
forthcoming, to answer and abide the judgment of the court in said
suit, or in default thereof, to pay and satisfy the judgment to the ex
tent of the value of said property ; and on the execution of such
bond, the said officer shall restore to the defendant, the property so re
plevied, and shall return the bond so taken, with the said writ of attach
ment, and all his proceedings thereon. Such replevin shall not affect
the lien of the attachment, or the proceedings thereon, as to any
rights, credits, or choses in action, of the defendant.
§ 1440. If any defendant in attachment shall, at any time before
the return thereof, execute and deliver to the officer serving the same,
a bond, with two or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by said

officer, payable to the plaintiff in attachment, in a penalty double the
amount claimed by said plaintiff, conditioned to pay and satisfy any
judgment which may be recovered by the plaintiff in said suit, with
all costs, the said attachment shall be thereby discharged ; and all the
property of every kind levied on, attached, or seized by virtue thereof,
shall be released and restored to such defendant. The said bond shall
be returned with the attachment; and in case of any recovery by the
plaintiff in said suit, judgment shall be entered up against the defend
ant and the sureties in the said bond. After the return of said attach
ment, the bond herein provided for may be given, at any time before
final judgment, and mai? be taken by the sheriff, or officer by whom
the attachment was served, in case any of the attached property re
mains in his hands, or otherwise, by the clerk of the court in which
the attachment is pending.
§ 1441. If the plaintiff shall be dissatisfied with the bond or secu
rity, given by the garnishee or the defendant, as hereinbefore provided,
he may, within sixty days after the return day of said attachment and
bond, by petition to the judge of the court, or to one of the judges of
the supreme court, obtain a citation to the sheriff, or other officer
taking such bond, to appear before such judge, at such time and place
as he may appoint, not less than five days after the service thereof,
and show cause, if he can, why the said bond or the security shall not
be adjudged insufficient; and such judge shall, then and there, examine
said bond, and hear such testimony as either party may offer; and in
case such judge shall consider the said bond, or the security, to be
insufficient, then such sheriff or other officer shall be subject to the
same judgment with the surety in such bond, in the same manner as
if he were co-surety thereon.

ARTICLE VII.
PROCEEDINGS BY AND AGAINST GARNISHEES.
§ 1442. When any garnishee, duly summoned, shall fail to appear
and discover, as by this chapter directed, the court shall enter a
judgment against him for the amount of the plaintiff's demand, and
all costs, and such judgment shall be final, unless cause be shown to
the contrary during the same term, and execution shall issue thereon;
provided, any such garnishee may answer under oath, to be certified
by any person authorized to administer an oath, and forward the
answer to the court in which said suit is pending.
§ 1443. Garnishees shall, in all cases, answer within the three firs!
days of the return term, unless the court, for cause shown, shall grant
further time ; and if, upon the answer or examination of any garnishee,
it shall appear that there is any estate of the defendant's in the hands

proceedings by and against garnishees.

293

of any person not summoned, the court shall grant an attachment, to
be levied on the property in the hands of such person, who shall
appear and answer, and be liable, as other garnishees.
§ 1444. If a garnishee admits an indebtedness not then due, execu
tion shall be stayed until its maturity ; and if he admits the possession
of goods or chattels of the defendant, not seized by the sheriff, such
goods or chattels shall be delivered to the sheriff, unless the garnishee
shall give bond for the forthcoming thereof, as hereinbefore provided.
§ 1445. When the plaintiff shall allege that the garnishee has not
made a full and true discovery of the debt due by him to the defend
ant, or of the property in his possession belonging to the defendant,
he shall, at the term when the answer is filed, unless the court shall
grant further time, controvert the same in writing, specifying in what
particulars he believes the answer to be incorrect. The court may di
rect a jury to be empaneled immediately, unless good cause be
shown for a continuance, to inquire what is the true amount due
from such garnishee to the defendant, and what goods or chattels are
in his possession belonging to the defendant ; and the court shall
grant judgment upon the verdict of the jury, as if the facts found had
been confessed by the garnishee in his answer. If the answer of the
garnishee be found true, he shall recover his costs against the
plaintiff.
§ 1446. The courts having jurisdiction of an attachment, may
summon any garnishee, from one county to another, who shall in all
respects be proceeded against in the same manner as garnishees re
siding within the county where the attachment is returnable. If the
garnishee, whose answer is contested, shall not be a resident of the
county in which the suit is pending, then, upon an issue being made
upon his answer, the venue for the trial of the issue shall be changed,
on his application, to the county of his residence. The court in which
the issue is tried, shall be authorized to grant new trials and continu
ances, as in other cases, and the verdict of the jury shall be certified
by the clerk, and returned, with the issue, to the court in which the
suit is pending, and judgment shall be entered thereupon, as if the
verdict had there been found.
§ 1447. No final judgment upon a garnishment shall go against
a surety or accommodation endorser, until judgment shall go against
the principal, and the preceding endorsers or co-sureties, who may
be liable to judgment, if they be residents of this state.
§ 1448. If the personal property attached, or any part thereof,
shall have been left in the hands of the garnishee, on his giving bond,
as hereinbefore prescribed, or shall have been replevied by the de
fendant, the jury trying the issue between the parties, if they find
for the plaintiff, shall assess the value of the property so left in the
hands of the garnishee, or replevied by the defendant, as well as the
debt or damages due the plaintiff ; and if the value of the property
shall equal the amount found due the plaintiff, judgment shall be

294

PROCEEDINGS BY AND AGAINST GARNISHEES.

[CHAP. 13.

entered against such garnishee and his sureties, or against the defend
ant and his sureties, on such replevin bond, for the amount of said
verdict ; and if the value of the property be less than the amount
found due the plaintiff, judgment shall be entered against the defend
ant, for the amount of the verdict, and against the sureties in his
replevin bond, or against the garnishee and his sureties, for the value
of the property so replevied, or left in the hands of such garnishee ;
and if judgment by default shall be entered, in such case, against the
defendant, a writ of inquiry shall be awarded, to assess the value of
the property so replevied, or left in the hands of the garnishee ; and
on the execution thereof, judgment shall be entered, as above pro
vided. In all cases provided for in this article, the judgment against
the sureties of the defendant, or against the garnishee and his sureties,
shall be satisfied and discharged, by the delivery to the sheriff of the
county, of the property replevied or left in the hands of the garnishee,
within ten days after execution on such judgment shall have come to
his hands ; and such sheriff shall sell the property so delivered to him,
and apply the proceeds to the payment of the execution ; and, in all
cases, the valuation of the property, by the officer taking such bond,
shall be prima facia evidence in favor of the plaintiff, of the value of
the property.
§ 1449. The defendant, in attachment, may contest the answer of
any garnishee, and may allege that the garnishee is indebted to him
in a larger sum than he has admitted, or that he holds property of the
defendant not admitted by the answer, and shall specify, in writing,
in what particulars the answer is untrue or defective ; and thereupon
an issue shall be made up, or the answer and exception shall consti
tute an issue, to be tried by a jury; but this controversy shall not
prevent the plaintiff from taking judgment for the sum admitted by
the garnishee, or for the condemnation of the property admitted to
be in his hands.
§ 1450. If the issue be found against the garnishee, judgment shall
be rendered against him for the amount of money or property in
his hands not admitted by him, which judgment shall be in favor of
the plaintiff, if necessary to satisfy his judgment or claim against the
defendant, or in favor of the defendant, if the judgment of the plaint
iff has been satisfied, or for so much thereof as may remain after satis
fying said judgment.
§ 1451. When a garnishee, by his answer, or at any time before or
after final judgment against him, shall allege that he has been notified
that another person claims title to, or an interest in the debt or property
which has been admitted by him, or found by a jury to be due, or to
be in his possession, and shall, if the question be of a debt due, pay
into the court the amount thereof, the court shall suspend all further
proceedings, and cause a citation to issue to the person so claiming, to
appear at the next term of the court, and contest with the plaintiff the
right to such money or property; or, if such claimant be a non-resident,

Chap. 13.J

ATTACHMENTS FOIv DEBTS NOT DIE.

295

publication shall be made in the same manner as against non-resident
defendants in attachment.
§ 1452. If the claimant fail to appear, the court shall adjudge the
money or property to the plaintiff. If he appear, he shall propound
his claim to the debt or disputed property, in writing, under oath or
affirmation, and the plaintiff may take issue thereon, and the same
shall be tried and determined as other causes in said court, and the court
shall adjudge the money or property to the party that may be found en
titled to the same; and in .all such cases the garnishee shall be pro.
tected from all further liability to either party, in respect to such debt
or property.
§ 1453. If a garnishee in attachment shall pay over or deliver, in
pursuance of the judgment or process of the court, any money or
property, which has been due, or belonging to the defendant before
notice of any sale, assignment or transfer thereof, by the defendant,
to any other person, such garnishee shall not thereafter be liable for
said debt or property to the vendee or assignee thereof.
§ 1454. The garnishee shall be allowed, by the court, reasonable
satisfaction for his attendance, out of the debt or effects in his posses
sion; or against the plaintiff in attachment, in case there be no debt
or effects in his possession ; provided, he shall put in his answer at the
return term of the attachment, within the time prescribed bylaw.

ARTICLE VIII.
ATTACHMENTS FOR DEBTS NOT DUE.
§ 1455. When any creditor, whose debt is not due, shall make
affidavit that he has just cause to suspect, and verily believes, that his
debtor will remove himself, or his effects, out of the state, before the
said debt will become payable, with intent to hinder, delay or defraud
his creditors, or that he hath removed, with like intent, leaving prop
erty in this state, and shall give bond, as in other cases, he may obtain
an attachment in the county where the debtor resides, or last resided,
or where his property may be found ; which attachment shall be issued,
executed and returned, and the like proceedings had thereon, as in
other cases of attachment ; and if the debtor shall not, on or before
the return day thereof, enter into bond to the plaintiff, in double the
sum due, with sufficient security, for the payment of the said debt,
when it shall become payable, and the costs of the attachment, the
court, on due proof of the justice thereof, shall grant judgment, as in
other cases of attachment; and on giving such bond, the same
shall be handed over to the said plaintiff, and the attachment shall
thereupon be discharged. When judgment shall be rendered, execu
tion against any garnishee indebted to the defendant shall be stayed,

296

CLAIM BY THIRD PARTY.

[Chap. 13.

until the claim of the plaintiff, or the garnishee's debt to the defendant,
shall become due, and the goods and property attached shall be sold
on a credit, until the time when the plaintiff's claim shall be payable.
The sheriff, or other officer selling such property, shall take bond from
the purchasers, payable to the plaintiff in attachment, for the amount
of his debt, interest and costs, which bond shall be returned with the
execution, and, if not paid at maturity, shall have the force and effect
of a judgment, and execution may issue thereon, as on a judgment of
a court of record; and where the property shall sell for more than the
debt, interests and costs, the officer shall take a bond for the surplus
to the defendant, and deliver the same to him; but no more property
shall be sold than is necessary to satisfy the judgment, except where
the property cannot be divided ; and the officer making the sale shall
only be entitled to commissions on the amount of the plaintiff's
demand, and the costs and commissions shall be included in the bond
or bonds, taken to the plaintiff, who shall be liable therefor to the
officers of the court. If the defendant shall have replevied the prop
erty, execution against the defendant, and the sureties in the replevin
bond, shall be stayed, until the plaintiff's claim becomes due and
payable.

CLAIM BY THIRD PARTY.

§ 1456. When property is levied on, under any writ of attachment,
and the same is claimed by any third party, as being his property,
such third party shall be entitled to all the provisions made by law

under writs of fieri facias. All the proceedings shall conform to the
provisions of the statute, relative to claimant's issues, herein re
ferred to.
§ 1457. Such claimant in attachment cases, may have his claim

defendant may file a plea in abatement of the attachment, traversing
the ground or grounds upon which the writ was obtained.
§ 1460. This plea shall be sworn to, and when it is filed, the issue
shall be considered as formed, without any response to the plea.
§ 1461. The court shall, at the first term, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, and before any trial of the case on its merits, cause a jury
to be empaneled, to try such issue, and determine, by their verdict,
whether the attachment was wrongfully sued out or not.
§ 1462. On the trial of such issue, both parties may introduce all
legal evidence relative to the issue, and the defendant may give
evidence as to the damages, if any, which the issuance of such attach
ment has occasioned him, all damage he has sustained, including
lawyers fees, traveling expenses, hotel bills, loss of trade and special
injury to his business; but the defendant, when he files his plea in
abatement, shall give plaintiff written notice of what special damages
he will insist upon at the trial.
§ 1463. If such issue be decided for defendant, he shall have judg
ment in his favor for the damages assessed, and final process shall
issue against plaintiff, and the sureties in his attachment bond, and
for damages assessed by the jury, and the costs of suit, and the
attachment shall be dismissed ; provided, that such judgment against
the sureties in the attachment bond shall not exceed the penalty
thereof.
§ 1464. If the issue be decided for plaintiff, the defendant shall be
permitted to plead to the merits, without delaying the cause unrea
sonably, on such terms as the court may impose.
§ 1465. The plaintiff may dismiss his attachment, but defendant
shall have a jury empaneled forthwith, to assess the damage sus
tained, by reason of suing out the attachment.

ARTICLE XI.

§ 1472. When a writ of attachment has been levied on the prop
erty of defendant, or served on any debtor of defendant as a gar
nishee, and it shall appear that the defendant has not been found,
or that he was attached as a non-resident, it shall be the duty of the
plaintiff to file in the court, or with the clerk thereof, an affidavit set
ting forth that said plaintiff hath been informed and verily believes the

final judgment; but no judgment by default, regularly taken, shall be
set aside, except upon cause shown ; and in case the defendant shall
have been personally summoned, or shall appear and plead to the
action, the judgment therein shall have the same force and effect,
against the person and property of the defendant, as in other actions
where a summons has been personally served on him: provided,

any attachments against non-residents, or absent defendants, upon
proof of publication only, the plaintiff shall, before any sale be made,

Jurisdiction of Subject Matter, and the Commencement
of the Proceedings.
Further Proceedings to Judgment, and the Results
Thereof.

ARTICLE I.
JURISDICTION OF SUBJECT MATTER AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PRO
CEEDINGS.
§ 1517. The writ of mandamus is an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, and issues from the proper circuit courts, commanding an
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person, to do or not to
do an act, the performance or omission of which the law specially
enjoins as a duty, resulting from an office, trust or station ; and it is
granted, on the petition of any private party aggrieved, without the
concurrence of the prosecutor for the state ; or on the petition of the
state by the attorney general, or the district attorney, by or without
the direction of the attorney general, when the public interest is con
cerned, and is in the name of such private party, or of the state, as
the case may be in fact brought.
§ 1518. If the judge of the proper circuit court shall be interested,
then the proceedings may be had, and the jurisdiction vest in the cir
cuit court of a convenient county of another circuit court district.
§ 1519. The plaintiff in such action shall state his claim, and shall
also state facts sufficient to constitute a cause for such claim, and
shall also set forth that the plaintiff (if a private individual), is per
sonally interested therein, and that he sustains, or may sustain
damage, by the non-performance of such duty, and that performance
thereof has been demanded by him, and refused or neglected, and
shall pray a writ of mandamus, commanding the defendant to fulfill
such duty.
§ 1520. The pleadings and other proceedings, in any action, in
which a mandamus is claimed, shall be the same, in all respects, as

Chap. 15.]

PROCEEDINGS TO JUDGMENT.

307

nearly as may be, and costs shall be recoverable by either party, as in
an ordinary action for the recovery of damages, and the trial shall be
had at the return term, unless continuance be granted, for cause shown.

ARTICLE II.
FURTHER PROCEEDINGS TO JUDGMENT, AND THE RESULTS THEREOF.
§ 1521. Where a discretion is left to an inferior tribunal, the writ
of mandamus can only compel it to act. It cannot control the dis
cretion of the inferior tribunal.
§ 1522. It shall not be issued in any case where there is a plain,
speedy and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law, ex
cept as herein provided.
§ 1523. In case judgment be given for the plaintiff, that a manda
mus do issue, it shall be lawful for the court in which such judg
ment is given, if it shall see fit, besides issuing execution in the ordi
nary way, for the damages and costs, also to issue a peremptory writ
of mandamus to the defendant, commanding him forthwith to per
form the duty to be enforced.
§ 1524. The writ shall simply command the performance of the
duty, and shall be directed to the party ; and, if he do not comply,
the court may compel compliance by an attachment directed to the
sheriff, which may be issued in term time or vacation, and returnable
forthwith, and no return except that of compliance shall be allowed,
but time to return it may, upon sufficient grounds, be allowed by the
court or judge, either with or without terms.
§ 1525. The court may, upon application of the plaintiff, instead of
proceeding against the defendant by attachment, direct that the act re
quired to be done, may be done by the plaintiff, or some other person
appointed by the court, at the expense of the defendant ; and upon
the act being done, the amount of such expense may be ascertained
by the court, or by a reference appointed by the court, as the court
or judge may order, and the court may render judgment for the
amount of such expense and costs, and enforce payment thereof by
execution.
§ 1526. During the pendency of the action, the court or judge in
vacation, may make temporary orders for preventing damage or
injury to the plaintiff, until the case is decided.
§ 1527. That this act shall take effect from and after the first day
of October, A. D. 1S71.
Approved, March 30, 1871.

AN ACT IN RELATION TO REPLEVIN.

ARTICLE I.
HOW OBTAINED, AND PROCEEDINGS THEREIN.
§ 1528. Whenever any goods and chattels are, or shall be, wrong
fully taken or detained, an action of replevin may be maintained by
any person having the right of immediate possession, for the recovery
thereof, and for the damages sustained by reason of such wrongful
taking or detention ; provided, such action shall be brought within
one year next after the plaintiff's right of action has occurred, and
not after.
§ 1529. Before any writ of replevin, in such case shall issue, the
plaintiff, or his agent or attorney, shall make and file in the office of
the clerk of the circuit court, or with a justice of the peace, in cases
within the jurisdiction of justices of the peace, an affidavit, setting
forth a description of the property taken or detained, and that the
plaintiff is legally entitled to the immediate possession of the same ;
that said property was wrongfully taken, or is wrongfully detained, by
the defendant, and that the plaintiff's right of action has accrued
within one year.
§ 1530. The writ of replevin shall command the sheriff or other
lawful officer of the proper county, to take the goods and chattels
specified in the affidavit, and to deliver the same to the plaintiff,
upon the plaintiff entering into bond to the defendant, with suf
ficient security, in double the value of the property, to be ascertained
by the valuation of the sheriff, or other officer into whose hands the
writ may come, conditioned that he will prosecute the writ with effect,
and without delay make return of the property to the defendant, if
return thereof be adjudged, and pay the defendant such damages as he
may sustain by the wrongful suing out of said writ, and also such
costs as may be awarded against him, and save harmless the sheriff or
other officer, as the case may be, for replevying the said property ; un
less the defendant shall enter into bond, with sufficient security in
like penalty, payable to the plaintiff, conditioned that the property
shall be forthcoming to satisfy the judgment of the court, and to
summon the defendant to appear in court on the return day of the
writ, to answer to the action. And upon the defendant entering into
bond as aforesaid, the property shall be restored to him.

Chap. 16.]

REPLEVIN—HOW OBTAINED.

309

§ 1531. The defendant shall give bond, as above provided, within
two days from the seizure of the property, and failing in that time,
the property shall be delivered to the plaintiff, as above provided ;
but if the plaintiff, when notified of the failure of the defendant to
give bond, shall not himself give the required bond, within a reason
able time, the property shall remain in the hands of the sheriff, or
other officer, until the trial, subject to the right of either party, on
application to the sheriff or other officer, to be allowed to give bond
and receive the property ; and if neither party gives a bond, that shall
not effect the suit but it shall nevertheless proceed.
§ 1532. The declaration may be filed, after the issuance of the
writ : provided, it be filed on or before the first day of the return
term, or before any order of nolle pros, be taken ; and the action may
be tried at the first term of the court. The defendant may plead
that he is not guilty of the premises charged against him, and this
plea shall put in issue, not only the right of the plaintiff to the pos
session of the property, but also the wrongful taking and detention
thereof. In cases before justices of the peace, the proceedings shall
be as in other cases before them.
§ 1533. When the property shall have been permitted to remain
in the possession of the defendant, if the plaintiff recover, the judg
ment of the court shall be against the defendant and his sureties, that
they restore the property to the plaintiff, or pay him the value thereof,
as assessed by the verdict of a jury, and also for such damages as
shall have been assessed by the jury, for the wrongful taking or de
tention ; and the valuation of the sheriff, shall in all cases, under this
chapter, be prima facie evidence of the value of the property.
§ 1534. If a plaintiff in replevin, to whom the property has been
delivered, fail to prosecute his suit with effect, the jury shall assess the
value of the property, and the damages sustained by the defendant,
and the judgment of the court shall be against the plaintiff and his
sureties, that they restore the property to the defendant, or pay him
the value thereof, so assessed, and also the damages so assessed, for
wrongfully sueing out the writ. If the plaintiff make default, or be
non-suited, the defendant may have a writ of inquiry, to assess the
value of the property, and the damages sustained by the wrongful
sueing out of the writ. And in the event of the death of any surety
upon such bonds, before the termination of the trial, the court may
order judgment nisi to be rendered against the personal representa
tives of such deceased surety, and the party may have like judgment,
upon the finding of the jury, as upon an issue found for him ; and if
no bond was given, and the property remains in the hands of the
sheriff, or other officer, the value of the property, and the damages
sustained, shall be assessed, and judgment shall be for the recovery
of the property, and the damages assessed against the party liable,
and the sheriff or other officer shall deliver the property to the suc
cessful party, and the execution shall issue for damages and costs of
suit.

310

REPLEVIN*

HOW OBTAINED.

[Chap. 16.

§ 1535. If the party in whose favor the judgment is given be in
possession of the property in controversy, he shall retain it, and a
writ of fieri facias shall issue for the damages and costs of suit; and
if the property be in possession of the losing party, the execution
shall command the sheriff to take the property in controversy, if the
same may be had, and deliver the same to the successful party, and if
not to be had, that he make the value thereof, together with the
damages and costs, of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements,
of the party and his sureties, against whom the judgment is ren
dered ; or the successful party may have his distringas to compel the
delivery of the property, together with a fieri facias for the damages
and costs.
§ 1536. The bond directed by this chapter to be taken in either
case, shall be returned with the writ to the court issuing the same ;
and if the sheriff fail to take a proper and sufficient bond, and return
the same ; or if the bond taken be adjudged insufficient, and the party
giving it shall, if required, fail to perfect the same, the sheriff shall
be liable to the party injured, for all damages by him sustained, either
by action of debt on his official bond, or by special action on the case ;
provided, the parties shall have the same right of amendment under
this chapter as that given by the chapter providing the remedy by
attachment.
§ 1537. If either party in such suit, or the sheriff, shall at anytime
deem any bond taken under this chapter to be insufficient, such party
or sheriff, if in vacation, may, upon application to the judge of the
court where such writ may be pending, obtain a citation, under the
signature of said judge, commanding the obligor in such bond to ap
pear before such judge, at such time and place as the said judge shall
therein designate, and if in term-time, such party or sheriff may pro
ceed, by motion, against the obligor on such bond, and in either case
the judge or court, shall, after hearing the evidence of both parties,
determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of such bond ; and if the bond
given by the plaintiff shall be adjudged insufficient, he shall give
a new and sufficient bond, within the time limited by the court or
judge, and in default thereof, the defendant shall be entitled to pro
ceed and enter judgment, as in case the plaintiff should be nonsuited,
or otherwise make default ; and if. the bond of the defendant shall be
adjudged insufficient, and he shall fail to give a sufficient bond, within
the time limited by the court or judge, the plaintiff, on giving bond as
by this chapter directed, shall be entitled to a judicial writ, command
ing the sheriff to take the property in controversy, and deliver the
same to the plaintiff; and thereupon such proceedings shall be had as
if the property had been delivered to the plaintiff in the first instance.

of October, A. D. 1871.

General Provisions.

ARTICLE I.
PLEADINGS AND PROCESS.
§ 1539. The consent rule, and all fictions heretofore used in actions
of ejectment, are hereby abolished, and the action of ejectment shall
be commenced by filing a declaration in the name of the person
claiming the premises in question, as plaintiff, against the tenant or
possessor thereof as defendant; the declaration shall describe the
premises with such certainty as will distinctly apprise the defendant
of their description and situation, and so that, from such description,
possession may be delivered ; and if the plaintiff claims only an undi
vided interest therein, it shall state such interest, and the declaration
may contain several counts. If the plaintiff shall claim more than he
is entitled to, he may, nevertheless, recover so much as he shall prove
title to.
§ 1540. On filing the declaration, a summons shall issue against
the defendant, which shall be issued, executed and returned, in the
same manner prescribed for the issuance, execution and return of a
summons in personal actions.
§ 1541. The defendants named in the summons, or either of them,
shall be allowed to plead to and defend the action, either jointly or
separately; the plea shall be, " not guilty," which shall be filed in the
same time required in personal actions; and under said plea, the
defendant may give in evidence any lawful defence to the action, not
inconsistent with the other provisions of this chapter. The defend

312

[Chap. 17.

ants, or either of them, may defend for a part only of the premises
in question ; and in such case, the part shall be described in the plea,
with the same certainty required in the declaration.
§ 1542. Every tenant, sued in ejectment, shall forthwith give
notice thereof to his landlord, under penalty of three years' rent of
the premises, to be recovered by the landlord or his representative*
in an action of debt; and the landlord of such tenant, or any other
proper person, shall, by leave of the court or judge, be admitted to
appear and defend the action, in all cases where the same would have
been allowed heretofore, and either separately or jointly with the ten
ant ; and any person admitted to defend as landlord, in respect of
property whereof he is in possession only by his tenant, shall state in
his plea, that he defends as such landlord, and such person shall be
allowed to set up any defence he has heretofore been allowed to set
up, and no other ; and any judgment, in such action, shall have the
same effect, for or against such person so admitted to defend, as if he
had been named in the declaration and summons, and regularly served
with process.
§ 1543. The plea of the defendant shall, for the purposes of that
action, be construed as an admission that he was in possession of the
premises for which he defends, at the time of the commencement of
the action.
§ 1544. If the premises be not described with sufficient certainty,
in the declaration or plea, the court, or judge, may order the pleading
to be amended, so as to contain such description ; and if either party
shall fail to comply with such order, judgment may be entered, as for
want of a declaration or plea, according to the circumstances of the
case.
§ 1545. If no plea be filed, within the limited time, the plaintiff
shall be entitled to judgment, that he recover possession of the prem
ises claimed in*the declaration, and costs of suit, and shall have his
writ of possession, including an execution for the costs.
§ 1546. If the defendant in an action of ejectment, shall desire to
deny that he was, at the commencement of the action, in possession
of any part of the premises in question, he may do so by a special
plea ; but in such case, the title of the plaintiff shall be admitted,
and the only question on the trial shall be in relation to the fact of
possession ; and in no case shall possession of part of the premises be
construed as possession of the whole, when an actual adverse posses
sion is shown.
§ 1547. Declarations, writs and pleas, in the form, or to the effect
of the precedents appended hereto, shall be good and sufficient for all
purposes, in any proceedings under this chapter.

[CUAP. 17.

plaintiff or plaintiffs, or either, and which of them, is entitled to re
cover the possession of the premises in question, and whether of the
whole or part, and if a part, then of which part ; and if the jury shall
find for the plaintiff as to part only, their verdict shall particularly
specify which part, and judgment shall be entered on such verdict if
not set aside by the court, that the plaintiff recover the possession of
the same, either in whole or in part, as the case may be, with costs,
upon which a writ of possession shall issue, which may include an
execution for costs, or a separate execution may be issued for the
costs.
§ 1553. If it shall appear at the trial, that the title of the plaintiff
existed, as alleged in the declaration, in such manner that the plain
tiff or plaintiffs, or one of them, was at the commencement of the
action entitled to recover possession of the premises in question, or of
some part thereof, but that such title has expired at the time of trial,
the plaintiff or plaintiffs so entitled shall, notwithstanding such expira
tion, have a verdict according to the fact, that he had such right of re
covery at the commencement of the action, and shall recover his costs
of suit, but as to the premises claimed, the judgment shall be that the
defendant go thereof without day.
§ 1554. In ejectment the successful party shall in all cases, except
when it may be otherwise provided, recover his costs of suit of the
other party, and may have the like execution therefor as in personal

persons, entitled as joint tenants, tenants in common, or coparceners,
any joint tenant, tenant in common, or coparcener defending the
action, may give notice with his plea, that he defends as such, and
admits the right of the plaintiff to an undivided share of the property,
(stating what share), but denies any actual ouster of him from the
property; and upon the trial of such an issue, the additional question
of whether an actual ouster has taken place, shall be tried, and if it
shall appear that the defendant is such joint tenant, tenant in com
mon, or coparcener with the plaintiff, and no such actual ouster shall
be proved, then the plaintiff shall be non-suited, with costs ; but if it
shall be proved, either that the defendant is not such joint tenant,
tenant in common or coparcener, or that an actual ouster has taken
place, then the jury shall so find by their verdict, and the plaintiff
shall have judgment in accordance with the verdict for the recovery
of possession and costs.
§ 1556. When the jury shall find for the plaintiff, in an action of
ejectment, if the defendant has a crop then planted, and growing
upon the premises in question, they shall assess a reasonable rent for
the plaintiff to receive, for the use of the premises, for such time as
they may think necessary for the defendant to make and gather his
crop; and if the defendant shall, during the term of the court at which
the action was tried, enter into bond, with security to be approved by

the jury, payable to the plaintiff, conditioned for the payment of the

jury, for the defendant to hold possession of the premises, then no writ
of possession shall issue upon the judgment in such action, until the
expiration of the time so allowed by the jury ; and such bond shall be
filed in the court, and if forfeited, shall have the force and effect of a
judgment, and execution may issue thereon against the principal and

§ 1557. In all cases where the defendant in ejectment would be
liable for mesne profits and damages, the plaintiff may declare for

but it shall be lawful, in all cases, for the defendant in ejectment, or
in an action for mesne profits, to plead the value of all permanent,
valuable, and not ornamental improvements, made by the defendant
on the land, or by any one under whom he claims, before notice of the
intention of the plaintiff to bring the action, giving notice with his
plea, of the character of the improvements, and the value thereof;
and if such improvements shall exceed the value of the mesne profits
and damages, the jury shall find the actual cash value of such im
provements, the value of the mesne profits and damages, and also the
actual cash value of the land, without the improvements ; and the
defendant shall have a lien upon the land for the difference between
the value of the mesne profits and the value of the improvements so
found; and no execution shall issue in favor of the plaintiff, until he
shall have paid the amount so due to the defendant ; and unless the
plaintiff shall, within three months after the rendition of the verdict,
pay the amount so due as aforesaid, the defendant may pay to the
plaintiff the assessed value of the land, with interest from the date of
the verdict, and shall pay the costs of the suit ; and thereupon the
execution of the judgment for the recovery of the land shall be per
petually stayed ; and if the defendant shall fail to pay to the plaintiff
the value of the land so assessed, with interest, and the cost of the
suit, within three months after the expiration of the time allowed the
plaintiff for making payment as aforesaid, an execution shall issue for
the sale of the said land recovered in the ejectment; and out of the
proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, the plaintiff shall be
paid the assessed value of the land, with interest from the date of the
verdict, and then the defendant shall be paid out of the residue, the

profits and damages, with interest as aforesaid, if the residue shall
amount to so much ; and if a surplus shall remain, such surplus
shall be divided between the plaintiff and defendant, in proportion to
the amount which each may be entitled to receive as aforesaid ; but
no defendant shall be entitled to such compensation for improvements,
unless he shall claim the premises under some deed or contract of
purchase, made or acquired in good faith.

follow upon the verdict in favor of, or against, the person making such
suggestion, as is hereinbefore provided, with reference to a judgment
for or against such deceased plaintiff.
§ 1563. In case a sole plaintiff die, after a verdict in his favor, and

tion of the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff, may order
that a writ issue for the delivery to such representative of the posses
sion of the premises recovered, and the same shall be delivered accord

defend the action, within a time to be limited by the court; and in
case such representatives appear they shall plead the same plea, and
the same proceedings may be taken against them, as if they had been
originally admitted to defend the action ; and if no plea be filed within
the time limited, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment for want
