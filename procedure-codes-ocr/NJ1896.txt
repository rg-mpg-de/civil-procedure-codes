(a) This action can only be maintained b the tenant, and
not by a stru.n,,'er, whose goods have been d strained. Horu
horne v. .Klc1'num, 2 1{ul.‘L9. It must appear on the record
what ihe single damages were. Ib. In a declaration, in an
action for unlawful distress there was n count for double value
of goods, under section ll, to which wu added a count for
injury to tenant’: business. The Jury returned, as sin le
damages, a sum us the value of the goods dlslrnlned and so d
and a sepamtc sum for lulury to tenant's businem. Held, that
the plaintln‘ could not recover both sums, but as the ﬁrst rind
lng was clearly under the ﬁrst count, there was no waiver of
the claim for double damages by ihc second count and ﬁnding.
Hrld. that the lust sum should he Itruck from the verdict
and judzment entered for double the value of the goods foun
by ihejury. Jiugilt v. Reed, H) Vr. 300.

wrongtul distress cannot give the s ecial mhiiel‘ in evidence

Passed November 28, 1789.

\VnsanAs, There may be divers ancient surveys of land fairly made,
which by the neglect of oflicers, or through some casualty, have not been
put on record, and others, the records whereof have been destroyed by ﬁre
or lost; by reason whereof, and the natural decay of marked lines and
corners, the ancient metes and bounds cannot be clearly ascertained but
by testimony and reputation; and whereas, it hath been found, on running
the lines of divers such surveys, that they hold more,or extend farther
than their strict length of chain, large measures having been formerly
allowed, even by the proprietors, as an encouragement to location, of
which avaricious persons do, or may take advantage against the owners
and possessors of such lands, by confining their surveys to the net length
of chain, thereby making vacancies of valuable improved parts, some
whereon buildings are erected and made, and on causing surveys to be
made of such overplns, have procured and may procure the same to pass
the council of proprietors without legal notice, or due preference given to
the possessors, who may have innocently supposed their title was indefens
ible, or otherwise would have willingly resurveyed, covered, and secured
the same; for remedy whereof in future,
5. SEC. l. That no such newly-made partial survey, now lying within
the council of proprietors. or which may hereafter he returned to them, or
