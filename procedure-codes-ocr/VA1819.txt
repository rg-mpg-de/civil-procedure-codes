1 . Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That, where any
■goods and chattels shall be distrained for any rent, reserved
and due upon any demise, lease or contract whatsoever, and
the tenant or owner of the goods so distrained shall not, within
ten days after such distress taken, and notice thereof, and
the cause of such taking, left at the chief mansion house, or
other most notorious place on the premises charged with the
rent distrained for, replevy the same, by sufficient security
given to the sheriff or officer serving such distress, to pay the
money or tobacco, and all costs, with lawful interest for the
same, at the end of three months ; in such case, such sheriff
or officer shall and may sell the goods and chattels so distrained
for, by public auction, to the highest bidder, either for money
or tobacco, according as the rent reserved shall be due and
payable, to be paid at the end of three months ; and shall take
bond of the buyer or buyers, with one or more sufficient secu
rities, to pay the same accordingly, with interest, to the land
lord for whom the distress was maAe.(a)
2. All and every bond and bonds, so taken in pursuance
of this act, shall mention that the same was or were entered
into, for goods or other estate distrained for rent, and restored
to the debtor, or sold to the obligor, (as the case shall be,) and,
before the expiration of the said three months, shall be delivered
to the landlord for whom distress was made. And if the
money or tobacco shall not be paid, according to the condition
of such bond, it shall be lawful, and full power and authority
is hereby given to the justices of the court where such bond
shall be lodged, upon motion of the party to whom the same is
payable, to award execution thereupon, with costs : Provided,
the obligors have ten days' notice of such motion ; and, upon
such execution, the sheriff or officer shall not take any sureties
for payment of the money or tobacco at a further day, but shall
levy the same immediately. And, for the better direction of
such sheriff or officer, the clerk shall endorse upon the back of
every such execution, that " no security is to be taken.'Y^J
3. Provided, always, That, when distress shall be made
for tobacco, between the last day of September and the last
day of December, in any year, and the goods distrained shall
not be replevied as aforesaid, such goods shall be sold and
security taken for paying the tobacco by the first day of January
then next ensuing; and the bonds, taken for the same and
costs of seizure and sale, shall be by the officer delivered to
the landlord for whom distress was made ; which last men
tioned bonds shall have the like force, and may be proceeded
upon in the same manner as any other bond, directed to be
taken by this act.fc)
4. Any officer who shall levy distress for rent, shall be
entitled, in case the property be replevied, to the same com-si
mission as in the case of a forthcoming bond, taken under any
writ of execution for the like sum, and may include such com
mission in every bond taken under such distress.(d)
5. In case any distress and sale shall be made, under color
of this act, for rent pretended to be in arrear or due, where iii
truth no rent is in arrear or due, to the person or persons distraining,
or to him, her or them, in whose name or names, or
right, such distress shall be taken as aforesaid, then the owners
of the goods and chattels so distrained and sold, his executors
or administrators shall have remedy, by action of trespass, or
upon the case, against the person or persons so wrongfully dis
training, or either of them, his, her or their executors and
administrators, and shall recover double the value of the goods
and chattels so distrained and sold, together with full costs of
suit.(e)
6. Upon any pound breach, or rescous, of goods or chattels,
distrained for rent, the person or persons grieved thereby shall,

in a special action upon the case, tor the wrong thereby sus-
tained, recover treble damages, with costs of suit, against thes
offender or offenders, in any such rescous or pound breach, or
ejther 0f them, or against the owner of the goods distrained, in
case the same be afterwards found to have come to his or her
Use or possession//^
7. No goods or chattels whatsoever, lying or being in or upon
anv messuage, lands or tenements, which are or shall be leased
li,e or lives> terlu of years, at will or otherwise, shall, at
any time hereafter be liable to be taken by virtue of any writ
of execution, or on any pretence whatsoever, unless the party,
so taking the same, shall, before removal of the goods from oft"
such premises, pay or tender to the landlord or lessor thereof,
or his agent, all the money or tobacco due, for the rent of the
said premises, at the time of taking such goods or chattels in.

8. Provided, nevertheless, That such rent arrear do not
amount to more than one year's rent; and, if more be due,
then the party suing out such execution, paying or tendering
to such landlord, or This agent, one year's rent, niay proceed to
execute his judgment ; and the sheriff or officer serving the
same, is hereby empowered and required to levy and pay to
the plaintiff, as well the money or tobacco so paid for rent, as
the execution money.(A)
9. Where any landlord or lessor shall have sufficient
grounds to suspect, that his tenant will remove his effects from
the leased tenement, to any other place, whether within or
without the county or corporation, before the expiration of his
term, so as no distress for the said rent can be made, it shall be
lawful for sucli landlord to go before any justice of the peace
of the county or corporation, where the lands leased do lie,
and make oath what rent the tenant is to pay, and at what
time the same will be due, and that he has just cause to sus
pect, and verily believes such tenant will remove his or her
effects out of the county or corporation before the time of paynient
; and thereupon such justice may, and he is hereby em-
powered and required, to issue an attachment against the goods
and chattels of such tenant, returnable to his next county or
corporation court ; and if such tenant shall not, at the time of
serving such attachment, or before, or at such next court, enter
into recognizance, with one or more sufficient securities, for
the payment of the said rent at the time it shall become due, it
shall be lawful for such court, and they are hereby required,
to order the goods attached to be sold by the sheriff* or Serjeant
at public auction, for money or tobacco, according to the reser
vation of the rent, to be paid at the time the rent shall become
due, the purchasers giving good security for such payment, and
to assign the bonds, taken for the same and the costs, to such
landlord or lessor; and the overplus of such sale, if any be
sides the charges of attachment and sale, to return to the
owner.(i)
10. When any tenant shall have actually removed his effects
from the leased tenement, before the rent reserved thereon
hath become due, so that there be not left on such tenement
property liable to distress, sufficient to secure the payment of
the rent so reserved, it shall be lawful for the landlord or lessor,
in like manner, to obtain an attachment, at anytime within
ten days after such removal, and to levy the same on the effects
of the tenant, wherever they may be found ; and in other res
pects to proceed therein, in the manner, and under the regu
lations herein -before prescribed.^
11. The agent or attorney in fact of any landlord or lessor
shall have the same right to obtain and prosecute, in the name
of such landlord or lessor, any attachment, upon taking th
oath prescribed by law, which the landlord or lessor would
himself have under like circumstances.(Z)
12. Whenever any distress shall be made for rent reserved
in wheat, corn, or any thing other than money, it shall be lawful
for the landlord or lessor to apply to the court of the county
or corporation, or to the superior court of law for the county
in which the leased tenement may lie, to ascertain the value
in money of the rent in arrear so reserved, and to order the
property so distrained, or so much thereof as may be neces
sary, to be sold for the satisfaction of such rent. And th
court, to which such application shall be made, ten days previ
ous notice thereof having been given to the tenant, or, in case
of his absence from the county, being set up at some conspi
cuous place on the tenement, shall proceed to ascertain th
value in money of the rent in arrear so reserved, either by thei
own judgment, or, if required by either party, by the verdic
of a jury, summoned and impannelled at their bar for tha
purpose, without the formality of pleading ; and, having so
ascertained the value, shall order a sale of the property s
distrained, and award costs to the landlord or lessor. In pursuance
of such order, the sheriff or seijeant of the court, o
the officer having distrained the property, shall proceed t
advertise and sell, under the rules and regulations prescribed
for the sale of property taken under execution, the propert
distrained as aforesaid, or so much thereof as shall be neces
sary to raise the amount of money and costs aforesaid ; and
shall return the residue thereof to the owner. The sheriff or
other officer receiving the money and costs aforesaid, or any
part thereof, under such order of court, shall pay over the
same to the landlord or lessor, and, on failure, may be proceed
ed against for its recovery, and subjected to costs and damages,
in the same manner and to the extent provided in the case o
a sheriff failing to pay money received by him on an execution
returned satisfied. It shall be lawful, however, for any such
tenant, at any time after the value of the rent shall be ascertained
as aforesaid, and before the sale shall have been made,
to execute a replevy bond, with sufficient security, for th
amount of the rent so ascertained and costs, payable with in
terest at the end of three months from the date thereof. Such
bond shall be taken in other respects in the same manner, shall
have the same force and effect, and shall be in the same man-
ner recoverable, as other replevy bonds hereby authorised in
cases of distress for rent.(m)
13. Whenever an attachment to secure the payment of rent
reserved in any other thing than money, and not due, shall be
issued against any tenant about to remove, or having removed,
his effects from the rented tenement, and such tenant shall
fa.il to give security for the payment of the rent, so reserved,
when " sha11 become due> ^ sha11 be lawful for the landlord or
lessor, in like manner, to have the value in money of the rent
so reserved ascertained by the court, before which the attach
ment shall be returned ; and thereupon, to have such proceed
ings for the recovery thereof, as would have been proper if the
amount so ascertained had been reserved in money.(n)
14. All actions of debt for rent in arrear, all actions on the
case for the use and occupation of lands and tenements, all
actions of trespass quare clausum fregit, and all actions of
waste, may hereafter be sued and prosecuted in the court of
the county or corporation, or the superior court of the county,
wn*cn *ne defendant may reside or be found, in like manner
^ transitory actions may now be sued and prosecuted therem.(o)
_
*5- No goods or chattels found or being in or upon any depremises,
such goods and chattels bona fide belonging to
any person other than the tenant of such premises, or some
person or persons bound or liable for the payment of the
arrears of rent, or of some portion thereof, due on such demise(j
premises, shall be liable to be distrained for the payment of
suc^ arrears 0f rent : Provided, however, That if such tenant
or other person, bound or liable for the payment of such arrears
of rent, or of any portion thereof, shall have any limited pro
perty or interest in such goods and chattels, the same may be
distrained and sold for such interest as such tenant, or other
person or persons bound or liable for the payment of such
arrears of rent, or of any portion thereof, may have therein :
Provided also, That no person, claiming title to such property
distrained for rent, shall, in any manner, avail himself of the
provisions of this section, unless by a writ of replevin sued
out and levied before the sale of such property under the dis
tress.^)
16. Any process of attachment against a tenant or tenants
^or ren** under anv lease or other contract, may hereafter be
executed and returned by a constable, in the same manner as
bylaw sheriffs are directed to execute and return the same.(<7)
17. In case any lessee for life or lives, term of years, at will,
or otherwise, of messuages, lands or tenements, upon the demise
whereof any rents are or shall be reserved, or made pay-
able, shall, at any time, fraudulently or clandestinely, convey or
carrv °' or from sucn demised premises, his goods or chattels,
'with intent to prevent the landlord or lessor from distraining
(m) 1815,c. 15, §4 . (/>) 1815, c. 15, § 7.
the same for arrears of rent so reserved, it shall be lawful for
such lessor or landlord, or any person or persons by him for
that purpose lawfully empowered, within ten days next after
such conveying away or carrying off such goods and chattels,
to take and seize the same wherever they shall be found, as a.
distress for the arrears of such rent, and the same to sell, in
the like manner as if they actually had been distrained by
such lessor or landlord in and upon the demised premises.(r)
18. Provided, always, That no goods or chattels so carried B
off, and bona fide sold for valuable consideration, before such ^
seizure made, shall be afterwards liable to be so taken or seiz- 8
ed for any arrears of rent.(s) U
19. Any person or persons having rent in arrear, or due K
upon any lease or demise for life or lives, may bring an action o
r.. . j. ' . ■', 5
or actions of debt lor such arrears ot rent, in the same manner b
as if such rent was due and reserved upon a lease for years.(i)
20. It shall be lawful for any person or persons having rent
in arrear, or due upon any lease for life or lives, or for years,
or at will, ended or determined, to distrain for such arrears
after the determination of the respective leases, in the same
manner, as if such lease or leases had not been determined. (v)
21. Provided, That such distress be made within six
months after the determination of such lease, and during the
continuance of such landlord's title or interest, and during the
possession of the tenant from whom such arrears became due.
And no distress for rent shall be made in any case whatsoever,
but within five years after such rent shall become due and in
. . •
arrear.(w)
22. Provided, also, That nothing in this act contained shall
extend or be construed to let, hinder or prejudice the Commonwealth,
in the levying, recovering or seizing any debts, fines,
penalties or forfeitures due, payable or answerable to the Com
monwealth ; but that the same may be levied, recovered and
seized in the same manner as if this act had never been
made.fx)
23. And, whereas very great and unjust delays have arisen
from the suing out writs of replevin in cases of goods dis
trained for rent ; for remedy whereof,
Be it enacted, That, before any writ of replevin shall be
granted in case of goods and chattels distrained for rent, the
person or persons praying such writ, shall enter into bond, with
one or more sufficient securities, in th« clerk's office, in the
penalty of at least double the value of the rent distrained for,
and costs of suit, to perform and satisfy the judgment of the
court in such suit, in case he, she or they shall be cast therein ;
and if, upon the trial of such suit, it shall be found that the
rent distrained for was justly due, the party injured or delayed
by suing forth the said writ shall recover, against the party
suing forth and prosecuting the same, double the value of the
rent in arrear and distrained for, with full costs of the suit.
And, upon any execution issued upon such judgment, the
clerk shall, in like manner, endorse that no security is to be
taken.(y)
W. . „ , ., , .. . ,.
24. VV here any person shall suggest, that the goods distrained
are his or her property, and not the property of the
tenant, nor held in trust for the use of the tenant in any man,
, . , . , . . J
ner whatsoever, and that the same, in Ins or her opinion, are
not liable to such distress, he or she, giving bond and security
*n manner herein-before directed, may sue out a writ of repleyjn
^ such goods, but not otherwise; and, in case the person
or persons suing out the said writ shall be cast in such suit,
judgment shall be given against him for double the value of
the rent in arrear and distrained for, with full costs as afore
said.^)
25. And, for the more speedy determination of such writs
0f replevin ; Be it further enacted, That every such writ issu-
ing from the clerk's office of any county or corporation court
shall be returnable to the next court after the same shall be
issued ; and such court shall, at their next sitting after the re
turn, cause an issue to be made up therein; and every issue
made up on such writ of replevin, whether in a superior or
inferior court, shall be tried at the following term, without
waiting for its turn in the order of priority in regard to other

the said lands, tenements or hereditaments, so letten, or any

had against the said lessors and their heirs ; "all benefit and
advantage of recoveries in value, by reason of any warranty
in deed or law, only excepted.(a)
28. The exccutous and administrators of any person unto
whom any rent is or shall be due, and not paid at the time of

judge shall prescribe, conditioned for the payment of such
charges as may be awarded against the prisoner, and that he
will not escape by the way. Every bond, so executed, shall
be recorded with the other proceedings, as herein -after provided
for ; and may be sued on, in the name of the person to whom
it is made payable, for the benefit of any person really interested1
therein.(a)
2. Whenever any such writ shall be served on the officer
or other person to whom it is directed, or, in his absence, from
the place where the prisoner is confined, on the person having
the immediate custody of the prisoner, it shall be the duty of
him on whom the writ shall be so executed, without delay, to
bring the body of the prisoner, or cause it to be brought before
the court or judge before whom the writ is made returnable, or,
in case of the absence of such court or judge, before any of
them ; and, at the same time, to certify the cause of the detain
er of such prisoner.(fe)
3. Any person failing to return the writ so served upon him,
with the cause of the prisoner's detainer, or to bring the b°dy
of the prisoner before the court or judge, according to the
command of the writ, for three days after such service, or,
when the prisoner is to be brought more than twenty miles, for
so many days more as will be equal to one day for every
twenty miles of such further distance, shall forfeit and pay to
the prisoner the sum of three hundred dollars; the right to
recover which shall not cease by the death of either or both of
the parties.fc)
4. It shall be lawful for a judge, in vacation, to take the
same steps to enforce obedience to any writ of habeas cor/nt
ad subjiciendum, as may be taken in term-time by any court
having jurisdiction over such writs.W)
5. The court or judge before whom the prisoner shall be
brought, shall, without delay, proceed to enquire into the cause
of his imprisonment, and shall either discharge him, admit him
to bail, or remand him into custody, as the law and the evidence
shall require ; and shall, moreover, either award against
the prisoner the charges of his transportation, not exceeding
seventeen cents per mile, and the costs of the proceedings, of
shall award costs jn his favor, or shall award no costs or charges
against either party, as shall seem right. The clerk of the court,
in the office of which the proceedings shall be recorded, may is
sue execution for the costs and charges, so awarded by a judgment
rendered in vacation, in the same manner as if the judg-
ment had been rendered in term time.(e)
6. The return made to such writ shall not hereafter be taken
to be conclusive as to the facts stated therein ; but it shall be
,
competent for the judge or court, before whom such return is
made, to receive evidence in contradiction thereof, and to de-
termine the same, as the very truth of the case shall require.f/y)
7. In vacation, a judge shall have the same power to coiu-
pel the attendance of a witness, to give evidence upon the triaU
as a court would have in term-time ; and whenever, either

ui term-time or in vacation, it shall be inconvenient to procure
the personal attendance of a witness, his affidavit, taken upon
reasonaD'e notice to the adverse party, may be received in evi-
dence.fg")
8. rl he proceedings and judgment shall, in all cases, be eu-
*ered °^ recol*d- If they be had in vacation, before a judge in
chancery, they shall be signed by the judge, certified to the
clerk, and by him entered among the records of the chancery
court> wi*hin the jurisdiction of which the judgment shall be
rendered : if before a judge of the general court in vacation,
they shall be in like manner signed, certified and entered
among the records of the superior court of law for the county
in which the judgment shall be rendered. Whenever either
party shall require it, upon the trial, the court or judge shall
cause to be made a Part of the record a11 the material fact*
proved. The clerk shall be allowed the same fee for entering
the record, as is allowed by law for copying a record, of the
same number of words ; which fee shall be charged to the pri9oner>
and taxed in the bil1 of costs' wllen costs are recovered
by him.(A)
9. The judgment so entered of record shall be conclusive,
until reversed in the manner herein provided for ; and noperson
remanded by such judgment, whilst the same continue
m force, shall be at liberty to obtain another habeas carpus, for
tne same cause> or> by any other proceeding, to bring the same
matter again in question, except by writ of error or by action
of false imprisonment ; nor shall any person, who shall here-
after be discharged from confinement by such judgment, be
afterwards imprisoned or confined for the same cause, unless
by the order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.(i)
10- If any party to such judgment shall feel himself aggrieved
thereby, it shall be lawful for the court of appeals, on
mo^on> *° grant a writ of error ; and, upon the trial, to reverse
or anirm the judgment, wholly or in part^; and to cause
such other judgment to be entered, and such other proceed;n^s
to be had, as the law and the right of the case may re-
<lulre 5 either awarding costs or not, at their discretion.(&)

half of the Commonwealth, or for any attorney, duly authorised,
on behalf of the United States, to obtain from the court
of appeals a writ of
error to such judgment, and to cause the
same to be reversed and otherwise proceeded on, in the same
manner as is allowed to the parties thereto. And, if, at any
time during the recess of the court of appeals, the Executive
of this Commonwealth should think that the public interest
requires the immediate revision of such judgment, it shall be
lawful for them to convene the said court, on any day which
to them shall. seem proper (0
12. The trial of all writs of error to judgments in case ot
habeas corpus, shall have preference, in the court of appeals,
to all other trials.(m)

prisoner shall be delivered to the constable, or other inferior
officer, to be carried to some common jail, or shall be sent, by

An act authorising certain proceedings on the Writ of Man-
damus* '
[Passed January 22, 1799.]
Whereas great difficulty and delay attends the present me
thod of proceeding on writs of mandamus, and it is proper that
the same should be amended by authorising certain other pro
ceedings thereupon :
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That,
as often as a writ of mandamus shall issue out of a court hav
ing competent jurisdiction within this Commonwealth, and a
return shall be made thereunto, it shall and may be lawful to,
and for the person or persons, suing or prosecuting such writ
of mandamus, to plead to, or traverse all or any of the material
facts contained within the said return, to which the person or
persons making such return shall reply, take issue, or demur ;
and such further proceedings, and in such manner, shall be had
therein for the determination thereof, as might have been had,
if the person or persons suing such writ, had brought his or
their action on the case for a false return, and if any issue
shall be joined on such proceedings, the person or persons
suing such writ shall and may try the same in such place as
an issue joined in such action on the case should or might have
been tried : and, in case a verdict shall be found for the person
or persons suing such writ, or judgment given for him or them
on demurrer, or by nil dicit, or for want of a replication or
other pleading, he or they shall recover his or their damages
and costs in such manner as he or they might have done in
such action on the case as aforesaid ; sucli costs and damages
to be levied by capias ad satisfaciendum, fieri facias, or elegit,
and a peremptory writ of mandamus shall be granted without
delay, for him or them for whom such judgment shall be given,
as might have been if such return had been adjudged insuffi
cient ; and in case judgment shall be given for the person or
persons making such return to such writ, he or they shall re
cover his or their costs of suit, to be levied in manner afore
said.
C. 128.
Jin act to regulate the proceedings in suits against corpora'
tions-,
[Passed February 19, 1816.]
j. j]E it enacted by the General Assembly, That, in all ac*'ons
or su'ts whicn may De instituted against any corporation,
instead of the process heretofore used to compel the appear
ance of such corporation, it shall be sufficient to issue a sum
mons to the sheriff or other proper officer, reciting the cause
of action, and summoning the said corporation to appear and
answer the same on the proper return day; which summons
shall be returnable in like manner, and subject to the same
rules and regulations, as other original process.
2. j}ND fig it further enacted, 'lhat, if a summons be issued
M°refiaid, against any banking, turnpike, insurance, or other
incorporated company, service on the president or other head,
or, in his absence, on the cashier, or treasurer, or, in the absence
of both the president or chief officer, and the cashier or treasurer,
then on any director of such company ; such president,
or other officer, being, at the time of service, within the county
in which he usually resides ; shall be deemed sufficient service
of the said summons. And, if the summons be issued against
the corporation of any city, borough or town, service on the
mayor or chief magistrate, or, in his absence, on the recorder,
or, in the absence 01 the mayor or chief magistrate, and recor
der, then on any alderman of the corporation, such mayor or
other officer being at the time of service within the limits of
such corporation, shall also be deemed sufficient. And, in like
manner, the service of such summons on the president, or, in
his absence, on any visitor or trustee of any incorporated college
or academy, or on the chief officer of any other corpora
tion whatever, or, for want of such chief officer, on any member
of such corporation, such president, visitor, trustee, chief officer
or other member, being, at the time of service, within the
county in which he usually resides, shall be deemed sufficient
service of such summons ; and, on the return of such summons
in any of the said cases, the same proceedings to a final judg
ment shall be had against such corporation as are had in other
suits at law after the return of a capias ad respondendum exe
cuted. On every summons served as aforesaid, the sheriff or
other proper officer shall make return distinctly on whom the
same nath been executed : otherwise, such service shall not be
deemed valid.
3. And be it further enacted, That suits in chancery against
corporations »hall hereafter commence by subpoena; and the
service of such subpoena, and of all interlocutory orders and
decrees, against such corporations, shall be made in the same
manner, and under the same restriction, as is herein-before
provided for the service of a summons in a suit at law. And
the same proceedings to a final decree shall be had against
such corporations, as are had in other suits in chancery.
4. And be it further enacted, That, if any judgment at law,
or decree in chancery, shall be rendered against any corpora-
tion, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff in the suit, to sue out
either a distringas, fieri facias, levari facias, or elegit, as he
may think proper ; and that the said writs of fieri facias and
elegit may be levied as well on the current money as on the
goods and chattels of said corporation.
5. All acts and parts of acts within the purview of this act,
are hereby repealed.
6. This act ^shall be in force from the time of passing
thereof. •
Whereas creditors have experienced great difficulties in the
recovery of debts due from persons residing without the juris
diction of this Commonwealth, but who have effects here suffi
cient to satisfy and pay such debts : for remedy whereof,
1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That if, in any
suit which hath been or hereafter shall be commenced, for relief
'n e<lu^J» ln an7 superior court of chancery, or in any other
court, against any defendant or defendants, who are out of
this country, and others, within the same, having in their hands'
effects of, or otherwise indebted to, such absent defendant or
defendants, « or against any such absent defendant or defen*
dants having lands or tenements within the Commonwealth,*
and the appearance of such absentees be not entered, and secu
rity given to the satisfaction of the court, for performing the
decrees ; upon affidavit, that such defendant or defendants are
out of the country, or that, upon enquiry at his, her, or their
usual place of abode, he, she, or they could not be found, so as
to be served with process ; in all such cases, such court may
ma'<e any or<^er> an^ require surety if it shall appear necessary,
to restrain the defendants in this country from paying ,con-
veying away, or secreting the debts by them owing to, or the,
effects in their hands of, such absent defendant or defendants,
and for that purpose may order such debts to be paid, and
effects to be delivered, to the said plaintiff or plaintiffs, upon
*neir giving sufficient security for the return thereof to such
persons, and in such manner as the court shall direct^)
2. The court shall also appoint some day in the succeeding
term, for the absent defendant or defendants, to enter his or
their appearance to the suit, and give security for performing
the decree ; a copy of which order shall, by direction of the
court, be forthwith published in any newspaper within this
Commonwealth, the circulation of wjiich shall, in the opinion
thereof, be best calculated to apprise the absent defendant or
defendants, of the pendency of such suit, and continued for
two months successively ; and another copy thereof shall be
posted at the front door of such court; or, such order of publication
may be entered at rules held in the clerk's office of
any superior court of chancery, subject to the control of the
court, in the same manner, that other proceedings at the rules
are subject to such control. If such absent defendants shall
not appear and give such security, within the time limited, or p
such further time as the court may allow for good cause shewn,
the court may proceed to take such proof as the complainant
shall offer; and, if they shall, thereupon, be satisfied of the x
justice of the demand, they may order the bill to be taken as f
confessed, and make such order and decree therein, as shall
appear just, and may enforce due performance and execution
thereof, by such ways and means, as have heretofore been used
for enforcing other decrees, requiring the plaintiff or plaintiffs B
to give security, as the court shall approve, for abiding such
future order as may be made, for restoring the estate or effects
to the absent defendant or defendants, upon his or their ap-
pearance and answering the bill : and, if the plaintiff or plaintiffs
shall refuse to give, or not be able to procure such secu-1
rity, the effects shall remain under the direction of the court,
in the hands of a receiver, or otherwise, for so long a time, and
shall then be finally disposed of in such manner, as to the
court shall seem just(6)
3. ' No sale, however, of any lands or tenements belonging
' to such absent defendant shall be decreed, for the satisfaction
' of any debt appearing to be due from him, unless the personal
' fund in the power of the court shall be insufficient for that
* purpose ; nor shall any such sale be decreed, until such lands
' or tenements shall have been fairly valued by discreet com-
* missioners, for that purpose appointed by the court, and act*
ing upon oath, and the valuation so made shall have been
* returned into court; nor shall such sale be decreed, until the
* plaintiff, or some one for him, shall have filed in court, or in*
* the clerk's office, bond with good security, in double the value
" of such lands or tenements, for performing the future orders
* and decrees of the court in that behalf.'
4. If any person or persons, who shall be out of the Commomvealth
at the time any decree is pronounced as aforesaid,
shall, within seven years from the passing such decree, return
and appear openly; or, in case of nis pr her death, if his or
her heir, executor or administrator, shall, within the said seven
years, be and appear openly within this Commonwealth, the*
plaintiff or plaintiffs, their executors or administrators, shall
serve such person or persons, so returning or appearing, with
a copy of the decree, within a reasonable time after such re
turn or appearance shall be known to the plaintiff or plaintiffs;
and, thereupon, such defendant or defendants, or their representatives,
may, within twelve months after such service, or
those defendants not served with a copy, or their representatives,
may, within seven years after the decree pronounced,
appear in court, and petition to have the cause re-heard ; and,
upon their paying down, or giving security for payment of such
costs, as the court shall think reasonable, they shall be admitted
to answer the bill, and issue may be joined, and witnesses
on both sides examined, and such other proceedings, decree
and execution hail, as may be just and right in the cause : but,
if the several defendants or their representatives, upon whom
*'le decree 8nall De so served, shall not, within twelve months
after such service, and the other defendants or their represen
tatives, upon whom no such service is made, shall not within
seven years from the time of the decree pronounced, appear
and petition to have the cause re-heard a9 aforesaid, and pay,
or secure to be paid, such costs as the court shall think rea
sonable, all and every decree, to be made in pursuance of this
act, against any defendant or defendants so failing, shall stand
absolutely confirmed against him, her or them ; and, at the end
0f such term, the court may make such further order for quiet'ing.the
plaintiff' or plaintiffs, in any such suits, in their posses-
-sfon and title to the estate and effects so sequestered or made
liable, as to them shall seem reasonable.(c)
5. In all cases whatever, where a suit is or shall be depend™8
'n a suPer'or C0U1't of chancery, or other court of equity,
concerning any matter or thing whatever, against any absent
defendant or defendants, the court may, on satisfactory proof
to them made, that such defendant or defendants is or are out
of this Commonwealth, or that, upon enquiry at his, her, or
their usual place of abode, he, she or they could not be found,
make any order similar to that which is directed to be made in
case of absent debtors, adapting the same to the nature of the
case; a copy of which order shall be published in like manner
as is directed in case of absent debtors ; and thereupon the
proceedings in relation to such absent defendant shall be, in
all respects, the same, both before and after the decree, as are
above prescribed in relation to absent debtors, so far as such
proceedings against absent debtors shall be applicable toother
absent defendants.(d)
6. If any person shall make complaint to any justice of the
peac6) that ]ns debtor is removing out of the county or corporation
privately, or absconds or conceals himself, so that the
ordinary process of law cannot be served on him, such justice
shall grant an attachment against the estate of such debtor, or
g0 much thereof as sHaJl be sufficient to satisfy the debt and
costs of such complainant; which attachment, where the debt
or demand shall exceed ten dollars, or four hundred pounds of
tobacco, shall be returnable to the next county or corporation
court, and directed to, and served by, the sheriff or his under8neriff,
unless in case where the sheriff is a party interested,
and then the same shall be directed to, and served by, a coro
ner or Serjeant ; and it shall be lawful for such sheriff or officer,
to serve and levy the same, upon the slaves, goods and chattels
of the party absconding, wherever the same shall be found, or
in the hands of any person indebted to, or having any effects
of, the party absconding, and to summon such garnishee or
garnishees, to appear at the next court to be held for the said
county or corporation, there to answer upon oath, what he or
she is indebted to such party, and what effects of such party
he or she hath in his or her hands, or had at the time of serving
such attachment; which, being returned executed, the court
may thereupon compel such garnishee to appear and answer
as aforesaid. (e)
7. Provided, always, That every justice of the peace, be-Pl
fore granting such attachment, shall take bond and security of b
the party for whom the same shall be issued, in double the
sum to be attached, payable to the defendant, for satisfying and
paying all costs, which shall be awarded to the said defendant,
in case the plaintiff', suing out the attachment therein men
tioned, shall be cast in his suit, and also all damages which
shall be recovered against the said plaintiff for his suing out
such attachment; which bond shall be, by the said justice,
returned to the court, to which the attachment is return-e
able; and the party entitled to such costs or damages, mayJ|
thereupon bring suit, and recover; and every attachment,
issued without such bond taken, or where no bond shall be
returned, is hereby declared illegal and void, and shall be dis-l
missed.f/^)
8. Provided also, That all attachments shall be i*epleviable
by appearance and putting in good bail, if by the court ruled r
so to do, or by giving bond with good security to the sheriff or
other officer serving the same ; which bond, the sheriff or other
officer is hereby empowered and required to take, to appear
at the court to which such attachment shall be returnable,
and to abide by and perform the order and judgment of such
court^
9. Upon the defendant or defendants replevying any attached
effects, by giving bond and security to the sheriff" or other
officer as aforesaid, the sheriff shall return the name of the
security by him so taken; and if such security shall be ad-fe
judged insufficient by the court, and if the defendant shall fail
to appear and give special bail, if thereunto ruled by the court,
such sheriff and security shall be subject to the same judgment
and recovery, and have the same liberty of defence and relief
as if such security had been taken upon the execution of mesne
proccss.(A)
10. It shall be lawful for any creditor, where his debt doth
not exceed twenty dollars, or one thousand pounds of tobacco,
to go before any justice of the peace of the county or corporation
where his debtor resides, and make oath how much is
justly due to him, and that he hath grounds to suspect, andP
verily believes, that such debtor intends to remove his effects ;
and, thereupon, such justice shall issue an attachment against
the estate ot such debtor, returnable to his next county or cor
poration court, directed to all sheriffs, Serjeants and constables
within the Commonwealth ; and, by virtue thereof, it shall be
lawful, as well for the sheriff, Serjeant, or any constable of the
county or corporation, where such attachment shall be obtained,
as for the sheriff, Serjeant or any constable of other counties or
corporations, to pursue and seize such effects, and to make
return of such attachment, to the court where the same shall
De returnable ; and, thereupon, such proceedings shall be had,
as in other cases of attachments.(i)
11. And, upon complaint made to a justice of the peace,
that anv person indebted to the complainant, in any less sum
than ten dollars, or four hundred pounds of tobacco, is remov-
out of the county or corporation privately, or so absconds
or conceals himself, that a warrant cannot be served upon him.
such justice shall, taking bond and security, as in this act is
before directed, grant an attachment against the estate of 9uch
debtor, or so much thereof, as shall be of value sufficient to
satisfy the debt and costs of the party praying such attach
ment, directed to the sheriff, or any constable of his county,
or Serjeant, or any constable of his corporation, and returnable
before himself, or any other justice thereof, who shall and may
proceed thereupon, as upon an attachment returnable to the
county or corporation court, (fc)
12. In all cases of attachments, the defendant shall be ad-
m;tted to make defence, and any other person claiming the
property attached, may interplead, without giving bail : Frovi-
ded, That the property attached shall not thereby be replevied.(i)
13. JF any sUCh attachment as aforesaid, returnable to the
county or corporation court, or before a justice of the peace,
shall be returned executed, and the goods or effects attached
shall not be replevied, or defence shall not be made without
bail as this act directs, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judg
ment for his whole debt, and may take execution thereupon ;
and all goods and effects attached and not replevied as aforesajd>
shall be sold and disposed of, for and towards satisfaction
of the plaintiff's judgment, in the same manner as goods taken
execution upon a writ of fieri facias. And, where any at-
tachment shall be returned served in the hands of any earnishec,
it shall be lawful, upon his or her appearance and exa
mination, in the manner by this act before directed, to enter up
judgment, and award execution, against every such garnishee
and garnishees, for all sums of money due from him, her or
them, to the person absconding, or in his, her or their custody
or possession, for the use of such person, or so much thereof
as shall be of the value sufficient to satisfy the debt and costs
0f the complainant ; and all goods and effects whatsoever, in
the hands of any garnishee or garnishees, belonging to such
absconding person, shall be liable to satisfy such judgment.(m)
14, Whenever any creditor, whose claim amounts to ten
or four h<"»dred pounds of tobacco, shall have sufficient
grounds to suspect that his debtor will remove with his effect
out of this Commonwealth, before his debt will be payable, o
whenever such debtor shall have so removed, leaving effects
it shall be lawful for such creditor, to go before any magistrate
of the county or corporation where his debtor resides, or, i
case such debtor has removed, where he last resided, or where
his effects may be found,, and make oath to the true amount of
his debt, and the time when it will be payable, and that he hath o
just cause to suspect, and verily believes, that such debtor will
remove himself, with his effects, out of the Commonwealth,
before the said debt will become payable, or hath actually so
removed ; and also, that he had no knowledge, when the said
debt was contracted, of the intention of such debtor so to re
move; and, thereupon such magistrate, taking bond and secu-Bo
rity from such creditor, as in other cases of attachments, shall H
issue an attachment against the goods and chattels of the
debtor, returnable to the next court to be hold en for such
county or corporation, which attachment may be served on any
goods and chattels of such debtor, or any garnishee or gar-
nishees. If such debtor shall not, on or before the return of
such attachment, enter into bond, with sufficient security, for
the payment of the said debt, when it shall become due, the
court, on due proof of the justice thereof, and of the intention
of the debtor to remove, or of his having actually removed out
of this Commonwealth, shall grant judgment, as in other cases j
of attachments: But execution shall be staid against any gar-
nishee, who shall state, that he is indebted, or will at a future a
day be indebted to the defendant, until the claim of the plain
tiff, or such garnishee's debt to the defendant shall become
due ; and the goods condemned shall be sold upon a credit,
until the time the plaintiff's claim shall be payable. The sheriff,
or other officer selling such goods, shall take a bond or
bonds with good security from the purchaser or purchasers, and
assign the same to the plaintiff, to the amount of his debt, in-
terest and costs ; and, where the property sold shall amount
to more than the debt, interest and costs, shall take a bond,
with good security, for the surplus, and assign the same to the
defendant : Provided, always, That not more of the goods at-
tached shall be sold, than shall be necessary to satisfy the debt,
interest and costs, except in cases where the property sold
cannot be divided; and, in such cases, the sheriff or other
officer shall be entitled to commissions only on the amount of
the plaintiff's demand ; which commissions shall be included
in the bond or bonds assigned to such plaintiff, who shall be
liable therefor, as for commissions included in a forthcoming
bond taken by virtue of an execution : Provided, also, That
all such attachments shall be repleviable in the same manner
as other attachments are by law repleviable. Where any such
debt shall be less than ten dollars, or four hundred pounds of
tobacco, an attachment maybe attained as aforesaid, return-
able before any magistrate of the county or corporation, who
shall and may grant judgment thereon, and direct the goods
condemned by nim to be sold in manner aforesaid, or execu
tion to be staid as aforesaid, against any garnishee or garni
shees.^)
15. JIsd be it further enacted, That, whenever the plaintiff
in any attachment shall alledge, that any garnishee summoned
in such attachment hath not discovered the true amount of
debts due from him to the defendant, or what goods and chat.
^ejs belonging to the defendant are in his possession, the court
shall direct, without the formality of pleading, a jury to be impannelled
immediately, (unless good cause be shewn by either
party for a continuance,^ to enquire, what is the true amount
due from such garnishee to the defendant, and what goods and
chattels are in his possession belonging to the defendant. If
the finding of the jury shall be against such garnishee, the
court shall grant judgment, in the same manner, as if the facts
found by the jury, had been confessed by him on his examination
; and, if the jury find in his favor, he shall recover his
costs arrainst the plaintiff.fo)
l6- Whenever, the goods and chattels, taken by virtue of

satisfied, and enter upon the record, that the freehold, title, or
interest of the land mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration,

wilful or malicious ; and in all other actions of trespass, where
the court before whom the trial shall be, shall not be satisfied,
and enter upon the record, that the trespass was wilful or ma-
licious ; « and in all actions upon the case, actions of covenant,
' and actions of debt for a penalty intended to secure the
'performance of a covenant or condition, where the court
* before whom the trial shall be, shall not be satisfied, and enter
« upon the record, that the action was neither frivolous nor
* vexatious,' if the jury find under six dollars, and sixty-six
cents, the plaintiff shall not recover more costs than the sum
so found, and, if more costs are awarded, the judgment shall
be void, and shall be amended upon a motion at any time, by
the court who awarded the same ; and the party injured shall
be redressed, as to such costs so wrongfully awarded, in case
the same be levied upon him. And, where several persons
shall be made defendants, in any action of trespass, assault,
false imprisonment, or ejectment, and, upon the trial thereof,
any one or more of them shall be acquitted by verdict ; every
defendant so acquitted, shall have and recover his costs of suit,
in like manner as if a verdict had been given against the plain
tiff or plaintiffs, and acquitted all the defendants ; unless the

persons defendant or defendants to such action, and shall
order it otherwise.(ar)

was by negligence or involuntary, and a tender or offer of suffi
cient amends for such trespass before the action brought ;
whereupon, or upon some of them, the plaintiff or plaintiffs
sna^ ^ enf°rce<l *° j°'n issue » and, if the said issue be found
f°r the defendant or defendants, or the plaintiff or plaintiffs
shall be nonsuited, the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall be clearly
barred from the said action or actions, and all other suits con
cerning the same.(jftr) *
III. And for the further regulation of costs :
23. Be it enacted, That, in all cases at law, except motions,
where judgment shall be given for the defendant or appellee,
ne sna^ recover his costs against the plaintiff or appellant,
and, have execution for the same.; and, in all such cases,
where judgment shall be given for the plaintiff or appellant,

same manner as costs are taxed against a person suing or sued,
in his own right. If such executor, administrator or other
Per9on> De defendant, the judgment or decree for costs shall
be levied of the goods and chattels of the testator or intestate,

gucn execut0r, administrator or other person be plaintiff, then
the judgment or decree for costs shall be rendered, to be le
vied only of the goods and chattels of the testator or intestate,
jn his hands to be administered ; unless the court shall be of
opinion, that such executor, administrator or other person, in
the prudent discharge of his official duty, ought not to have
brought the action ; and, if the court shall be of that opinion,
then they shall render the judgment or decree for costs, to be
levied of the goods and chattels of the testator or intestate,
in the hands ot such executor, administrator or other person to
be administered, if so much thereof be found, if not, then of
his own proper goods and chattels : Provided, That nothing
herein contained shall be construed to take away or abridge
the discretion of a court of equity over the subject of costs.(x)
26. When any plea in abatement shall, upon argument in
any court of law, be adjudged insufficient, the plaintiff shall
recover full costs to the time of overruling the plea, a lawyer's
fee only excepted ;(a) * and when, by an interlocutory j adg-
• ment, any other part of the pleadings shall be adjudged in•sufficient,
all costs occasioned by such insufficient pleading,
' shall be adjudged against him who committed the fault.'
27. ' Every new trial granted at law, shall be upon the
' condition of paying the costs of the former trial, unless such
« new trial be granted for the misconduct of the opposite party
' and in such case, the person guilty of the misconduct, shal
' be adjudged to pay the costs of the former trial.'
28. Every action at law, or suit in equity, commenced or
prosecuted in the name of any person, not residing in Virginia,
unless he be employed abroad, in the service of the Commonwealth,
or of the United States of America, shall be dismissed,
if security be not given with the clerk of the court, in which
the suit shall be depending, within sixty days after notice shall
at any time during such non-residence, have been given to th
demandant or plaintiff, or his attorney, by some person inte
rested, that such security is required for payment of the cost
and damages, which may be awarded to the tenant or defen
dant, and also for the fees which will become due to the officer
of the court :(&) Such non-resident demandant or plaintiff, re
quiring services of the clerk of any court, shall secure th
payment of the fees for such services, before the said cler
shall be obliged to perform them.fc) 'In all cases, where secu
' rity for costs shall be required under the provisions of tli
' section, and a question shall arise as to the residence of th
* plaintiff or demandant, the burthen of proving such residenc
' shall be upon him.'
29. A fee of fifty cents for each legal notice proved to have
been delivered, in any cause, whether at law or in equity, shall
be taxed in the bill of costs.(d)
30. All taxes imposed on law proceedings, shall be included
in the bill of costs.(<>)*
31. The laws ot costs shall not be interpreted as pena
laws.f/;
IV. For preventing delays :
32. Be it enacted, That the parol shall not demur, in any
suit now depending, or hereafter to be brought, in any court o
law or equity, by reason of the infancy of the plaintiffs or de
fendants, or of any or either of them, but the court may never
theless proceed to judgment or final decree, in the same.(g")
55. No plea in abatement shall be admitted or received,
unless the party offering the same shall prove the truth thereof,
by oath or affirmation, as the case may require ; and no plea of
non est factum, offered by any person, charged as obligor, cove-
nantor, or grantor of a deed, shall be admitted or received,
unle9S the truth thereof sha11 in ,ike
manner be proved, by
oath 0l* affirmation ; and where any person, other than the obli-
gor, covenantor or grantor, shall be the defendant, such defenshall
prove, by oath or affirmation, that he or she verily
believes that the deed, on which the action is founded, is nut
the deed of the person charged as obligor, covenantor or gran-
tor.(i)
54. Process in all real actions, other than writs of right,
si,an De according to the course of the common law, except
that the returns shall be according to the laws of this Com-
mon wealth; but all essoins, views and vouchers shall be and
they are hereby taken away ; and, after one imparlance, unless
*ne tenant shall plead non-tenure, joint tenancy or several
tenancy, in abatement, and then, after such plea shall be over-
ruled, he shall put himself on the grand assize, and the mise
shall be joined upon the mere right, ' or the general issue be
•joined, as the case may require,' and be tned at the next
court, by twelve jurors, to be summoned, tried and sworn, as
in all other actions : And, to remove all delays and groundless
pretences, in saving the default of the tenant, no excuse shall
be admitted but non-summons ; and, such excuse being allowed,
he may imparle, and, at the next court, shall either plead in
abatement, or put himself opon the grand assize, or upon the
country, as aforesaid.(fc) .

brought, f°r the recovery of any lands or tenements, within
this Commonwealth, if the tenant shall plead, that hehoAdeth
the tenements in demand, jointly with nis wife, or any other
person, not named in the writ, and shew forth a deed testify
ing the same, and demand judgment of the writ, and thereupon.
issue be joined, and it be found against the truth of the plea,
by him in manner aforesaid pleaded, the plaintiff shall recover
^ geisin rf the tenement9 f„ den]
ms seism °f the tenements in demand, and double damages,
against the party by whom such plea shall have been pleaded ;
but, if it be found that the matter aforesaid was truly and law-
fully alleged, by such defendant, in his plea, the writ shall be
abated ; Provided, always, That no such plea shall be admitted
or received in any case, unless the party offering the same
shall prove the truth thereof by oath or affirmation, as the
case may require.(Z)
36* By the excePt»On of non-tenure of parcel of any lands
or tenements, for which any action or suit shall be brought, the
writ shall not be abated, but for the quantity of the non -tenure
which shall be allesred.fm)
, ut ° V' > • j • i >i i
• Where any action, real or mixed, is now or shall be
* depending, in any court of this Commonwealth, for the recove-
« ry of any lands or tenements, and any party thereto shall die,
'before verdict rendered, such action shall not abate, if the
' same be maintainable by or against the heir or devisee of the
' deceased party. But the plaintiff', or, if he be dead, his heir
' or devisee, may have a scire facias against the defendant, or,
' if he be dead, against his heir or devisee, to shew cause gene-
• rally why such action shall not be proceeded in to a final judg«
ment. Upon the return of such scire facias executed, if no
• good cause be shewn to the contrary, such heir or devisee shall
' be made a party to the action, and the cause shall proceed in
• the same manner as if such heir or devisee had been originally
' a party thereto ; Provided, That such heir or devisee shall
• have liberty to plead de novo, or to amend the pleadings in such
• manner as the nature of the case may require ; and that he
« shall be entitled to a continuance of the cause, for one term
■ after such scire facias returned executed.'
38. Where any 'personal* action' or suit in equity, is now
or shall be depending in any court of this Commonwealth, and
either of the parties shall die, before 'verdict renderedt or
final' decree be had, such action or suit shall not abate, if the
same were originally maintainable by or against an executor
or administrator, but the plaintiff, or, if he be dead, his execu-
tor or administrator, or the sheriff, Serjeant, * or other curator
' of the decedent's estate,' shall and may have a sr.ire facias
against the defendant, or, if he be dead, against his executor
or administrator, or against the sheriff, Serjeant, ' or other
• curator of his estate,' to shew cause generally why such ac
tion or suit shall not be proceeded in to a final judgment or
decree. And if such executor, administrator, sheriff', Serjeant
• or curator,' upon the return of a scire facias executed, shall
neglect or refuse to enter his or her appearance to the suit,
the court may proceed to final judgment or decree therein, in
the same manner as if such executor, administrator, sheriff",
Serjeant ' or curator' had entered his or her appearance. And
if such executor, administrator, sheriff, Serjeant ' or curator'
shall appear to the suit upon the return of such scire facias
executed, or if, without a scire facias, he or she shall, volun
tarily, enter himself or herself defendant to such suit, then,
and in either case, such executor, administrator, sheriff, Ser
jeant ' or curator' shall have liberty to plead de novo to the
plaintiff's action, every such plea or pleas, as an executor or
administrator may lawfully plead, or as the deceased party
might or could have pleaded, if he or she had lived ; and if
such executor, administrator, sheriff, Serjeant ' or curator'
should not desire to plead de novo, or, if no issue shall have
been joined or pleadings entered, before the death of his or
her testator or intestate, or if any interlocutory judgment or
decree shall have been entered in the life-time of the deceased
party, and the executor, administrator, sheriff, Serjeant « or cu«
rator,' shall refuse to plead, or shall not desire to set aside
the interlocutory judgment or decree, the court shall proceed
to final judgment or decree, for or against the executor, admin-
istrator, sheriff, Serjeant * or curator,' in the same manner, as
if the original writ had been issued against him or her, as
executor, administrator, sheriff, Serjeant * or curator,' anil the
cause shall remain in its place on the issue or rule docket, as
the case may be. But, the defendant being an executor, administrator,
sheriff, Serjeant • or curator,' shall be entitled to
a continuance until the next term after that to which a scire
facias shall have been returned executed, or at which he or
she shall have voluntarily entered himself or herself a defendant.(p)
And, if there be two or more plaintiffs or defendants,
one or m0re of them should die, if the cause of action
surviye to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs, or against
the surviving defendaut or defendants, the writ or action shall
proceed at the suit of the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs,
against the surviving defendant or defendants. Antl in all
actions, real, personal and mixed, if either party should die
between verdict and judgment, such death shall not be pleaded
jn aDatement, but judgment shall be entered as if .both parties

of the deceased party, shall not appear and pray for
such scire facias, at or before the second term of the court,
next after that at which the death of such party shall have
' been suggested on the record, such action or suit shaJi be dis'
continued, unless good cause be shewn to the contrary.'
V. For regulating certain proceedings in Civil cases;
39. Be it enacted, That, until an alteration be made, by the
court of appeals, in the forms of writs, the same shall be, as
nearly as may be, assimilated to those heretofore used, in
the general couvt(r)
40. All writs, summonses and other legal process, shall be
issued by the clerk, and bear teste in his name ; and shall be
returnable as herein-after directed, except sitbpaenas for wit
nesses, which may be returnable, either to the next court, or
immediately, or to any day of the term.(sj
41. Except in cases where it shall be otherwise expressly
provided by law, no writ of capias ad respondendum, from any
superior or inferior court of law, shall be issued against any
person, in any other county or corporation, than that in which
he resides, until a non est inventus has been returned in Ins or
|ler own county or corporation, upon a capias issued against
such defendant, for the same cause of action ; and every writ
issued contrary hereto,* shall be void and dismissed, upon thi
first calling thereof: Provided, nevertheless, That, where two
or more persons are or shall be, jointly, or jointly and severally,
bound for the performance of any contract, or for the payment
of any money or tobacco, by bond, covenant, or otherwise, it
shall be lawful to prosecute such persons jointly, in any county
or corporation wherein either of them may reside, and process
shall be issued accordingly from the court having jurisdiction
over such county or corporation, and shall be served on the
non-resident defendant, if he be found therein : Provided,
also, That such writ may issue against any defendant or de-r
fendants, in any county or corporation, wherein the cause of
action or any part thereof arose, although such defendant or
defendants do not reside therein, and although no such previous
wfit shall have issued in his or her own county or corporation:
And provided, moreover, That, where any person hath no fixed
or known residence, in any county or corporation, within this
Commonwealth, such writ may be issued and served upon him,
in any county or corporation, in which he may be found.(t)
42. It shall not be lawful to demand bail, in any personal
action, except as is herein-after particularly mentioned: And
in all such actions wherein bail may not lawfully be demanded,
the plaintiff, or his attorney, shall, on pain of having his suit
dismissed with costs, endorse, on the original writ or subse
quent process, the true species of action, and that bail is not
required in order that the sheriff may be informed how to
govern himself in the execution thereof; and, in the cases belore
mentioned, the sheriff may take the engagement of an
attorney practising in the court, from which the process issued,
endorsed on the writ, that he will appear for the defendant or
defendants, and such appearance shall be entered with the
clerk in the office on the return day of the writ. And although
no such engagement of an attorney shall be offered to the sheriff,
he shall nevertheless be restrained from committing the
defendant to prison, or detaiuing him in his custody, for want
of appearance bail, but the sheriff in such case shall return the
writ executed ; and if the defendant shall fail to appear thereto,
there shall be the like proceeding against him only, as is herein-
after directed, against defendants and their appearance bail,
where sucli is taken.(v)
43. In all actions of debt, founded upon any writing obligatory,
bill or note in writing, for the payment of money or tobac-
co, all actions of covenant and detinue, and all actions upon
statutes specially authorising bail to be taken, the plaintiff may
of right demand bail ; and if he shall endorse on the original
writ or subsequent process, the true species of action, in such
manner that his title to bail will appear thereby, and shall also
endorse that bail is required, it shall then be the duty of the
sheriff to take bail accordingly.^)
44. In all other personal actions, it shall be lawful for any
judge of the general court, or any justice of the peace for any
county or corporation, upon proper affidavit, verifying the justice
of the plaintiff's action, and shewing probable cause to
apprehend that the defendant will depart from the jurisdiction
of the court so that process of execution cannot be served upon
ym> ^Q t|n.ect Da;j ^0 i,e taken, by endorsement on the original
writ, or subsequent process, and the sherift' shall govern nimself
accordingly.(x)
45. In all cases, where bail shall so have been required, by
*'ie enJ°r8emen* °f the plaintiff or his attorney, or of a judge
or justice, the sheriff shall return on the writ, the names of the
bail by him taken, and shall return the bail bond or a copy
thereof, to the clerk's office, on the day of appearance. And
^ ^ (|efen(jant shall fail to appear accordingly, and give
special bail, the bail for appearance may defend the suit, and
sliall be subject to the same judgment and recovery, as the
defendant might or would be subject to, if he had appeared
and given special bail. If the sheriff shall not return bail and
the bail bond, or a copy thereof, and the defendant shall fail to
appear and give special bail, in such case the sheriff shall have
like liberty of defence, and shall be subject to the same judgment
and recovery, as is provided in the case of appearance bail.
If the bail, returned by the sheriff, be objected to by the plain-
tiff, and be adjudged insufficient, by the court, and the defendant
sha11 fail 't0 £>ve sPedal bail> the sheriff shall thereupon be
considered a party to the proceedings ; and, without remanding
the cause to the rules, he, together with the appearance bail,
shall be subject to the same judgment and recovery, that the
appearance bail alone would have been subject to, and shall be
entitled to the same defence.^
46. Objections to the sufficiency of the appearance bail
s^a" be taken, either at the rules, or in court, at or before the
first term after the return day of the writ, and not thereafter \
Thev shall be decided by the court, without del&y,(y) * and the
burtlieii of the proof shall be on the party affirming the suffi
ciency.'
47. If the sheriff ' or appearance bail,' depart this life, be-
fore iu(j(rment be confirmed against him, in such case, the
. . » 5 ■ i- i P • i • ± i - •
judgment may be confirmed against his executors or administrators;
or, if there shall not be a certificate of probat or ad
ministration granted, then it may be confirmed against his
estate ; and a writ of execution may in either case be issued.fy)
48. ' In all cases wherein the bail being adjudged insuffi<
cient, judgment shall be rendered against the sherift', his execu-
« tors, administrators or estate, such sheriff and his representa
tives shall have the same remedy against the estate of the
' bail, as against the estate of the defendant.' *
^N ever/ case> where judgment shall be confirmed
against any defendant or defendants, and the appearance bail,
or the sheriff, or the executors, administrators or estate of such
*?Pearance bail or sheriff, the court, on motion of such bail or
sheriff, or executors or administrators, or other person on be
half of the estate of such sheriff or bail, may order an attach
ment against the estate of such defendant or defendants, returnable
to the next succeeding court, and upon the execution
and return of such attachment, the court shall order the estate
seized, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the
judgment and costs, and all tosts accruing under the attachment,
to be sold as goods taken in execution upon a. fieri facias ;
and, out of the money, such judgment and costs shall be satisfied,
and the surplus, if any, restored, to the defendant or de-P
fendants, when required .(z)
50. In any personal action, in which bail shall not have been
required, the court may at any time before final judgment, for
good cause shewn, rule the defendant to give special bail, and,
on his failure to do so, may refuse him permission to plead, or
may set aside any plea already pleaded by him, and award aE
writ of enquiry, or otherwise proceed to judgment according8
to law, or may cause him to be arrested and committed to
prison/ej
51. Any judge of the general court, when not sitting in
court, or any justice of the peace, or any mayor, recorder or
alderman of a corporation, may take recognizance of special
bail, in any action depending in any court of record within
this Commonwealth, which shall be transmitted by the person
taking the same, before the next succeeding court, to the clerk
of the said court, to be filed with the papers in such action ;
the form of which recognizance shall be in substance as fol-
loweth, to wit :

ledging the recognizance aforementioned, a bail piece, in sub
stance as followeth, to wit :
County (or corporation) sc.

E. F. of the parish and county (or corporation) aforesaid, at
the suit of Jl. B. Given under my hand, this day of
G. H.lb)
53. In actions of detinue, the recognizance of bail shall be
so changed, as to subject the bail to the restitution of the thing,
whether animate or inanimate, sued for, or the alternative
va^ue> M tne court may a('judge.(c) If the plaintiff, or his
j attorney, shall except to the sufficiency of any special bail so
ta^en out °f court, notice of such exception shall be given to
the defendant or his attorney, a reasonable time before the
shall be tried. And if "such bail shall be adjudged insuf^cient
by the court, the recognizance thereof shall be discharg-
e^> antl such proceedings shall be had, as if no such bail had
been taken.(u')
^'VERV special bail may surrender the principal, before
*ne court where the suit hath been or shall be depending, at
any time either before or after judgment shall be given: 5Vo«
riaed, That such surrender be made before the appearance

defendant or defendants in his custody, in the same manner,
and subject to the like rules, as are provided for debtors com

agent or attorney, shall sooner consent to his, her or their
discharge ; and, if, within the said twenty days, such creditor,
n's Forney or agent, shall not, in writing, charge the debtor or
debtors in execution, he, she or they shall be forthwith discharged
out of custody. But the plaintiff or plaintiffs may
''nevertheless afterwards sue out any legal execution, without
suing out a. scire facias.(e)
55. When the principal debtor now is or hereafter may be
imprisoned, in any jail in the Commonwealth, by virtue of
process from any court, or any civil officer ; and any person or
persons, his special bail, shall desire to surrender such debtor,
in discharge of the recognizance of bail ; it shall be lawful
for such bail to obtain a certified copy of such recognizance,
a either from the clerk where the same shall have been entered
in court, or returned thereto, or from the judge or justice w ho
shall have taken it, where such recognizance shall not have
been returned to court ; (which copy it shall be the duty of the
clerk, judge or justice to grant;) and to obtain, annexed to
such copy of the recognizance, a certificate from the clerk of
the court, stating the situation of the suit, in which such bail
hath been entered, and specifying particularly whether final
judgment hath been rendered therein, or the same be still
pending: and it shall be lawful for the bail to deliver the said
certified copy of the recognizance, and the said certificate of
the clerk, to the sheriff, Serjeant or jailor, in whose custody the ^
debtor may be, and to demand a receipt therefor. Such she-
riff, Serjeant or jailor shall thereupon give to the bail, his agent
or attorney, a receipt for the said copy of the recognizance
and certificate of the clerk, in which shall moreover be express
ed, that the special bail, in discharge of his recognizance afore
said, had committed to the keeping of the said sheriff, seijeant
or jailor, the body of the debtor, then in the custody of such
sheriff, Serjeant or jailor, under process from some court, or
civil officer, of the Commonwealth, which process shall be
plainly described on the face of such receipt. The debtor so
committed shall be detained in custody by such sheriff, ser"}

any county or corporation, other than that in whicli the suit
was brought, such debtor, unless sooner discharged by the con

twenty miles of the computed distance of the place of his
confinement, from the jail of the court in whicli the suit was
brought. The special bail shall immediately give notice of
such commitment, to the creditor, his agetit or attorney at 'aw't°
if to be found in the county or corporation wherein the suit is
or was depending, and shall file with the clerk of the court in
which such suit is or was depending, the receipt of the sheriff,
Serjeant or jailor taken as aforesaid, and take his receipt
therefor// )
56. When, pursuant to the provisions of this act, the special
bail shall have surrendered his principal to the custody ofh
the sheriff, seijeant or jailor, or shall havo committed him to
the keeping of the sheriff, seijeant or jailor, in whose custody
such principal was before, and shall exhibit before the court,
in which the suit is or was depending, satisfactory evidence,
that, in due time thereafter, he gave to the creditor, his agent
or attorney, such notice of the surrender or commitment, as is
hereby required ; or that such creditor, his agent or attorney
was not to be found in the county or corporation aforesaid, and
that in due time he filed with the clerk of the court the re
ceipt of the sheriff, seijeant or jailor, taken as aforesaid ; such
bail shall thereupon be entitled to an exonoretur, to be entered
in court, and shall be thereafter forever discharged from the
said recognizance, in the same manner as if he had surren
dered his principal in court : But no sucli exonoretur shall be
entered, unless the creditor, his agent or attorney be present
jn cour^ or nave reasonable notice of the application there-
57. Any defendant surrendered into custody, or committed
by his bail, in manner herein provided, may, at any time be-
^na' jut^Sment shall have been rendered in the action,
discharge himself from such surrender or commitment, by giving
other good special bail : Provided, That the sufficiency of
gucn bail shall be verified on oath, to the satisfaction of the
court. judge or justice, taking the same, and the recognizance
thereof shall be duly filed with the clerk of the court wherein
the suit is depending, before such defendant shall be dis
charged. ('/j
58. ' If any defendant, having given special bail in any ac-
tion, shall afterwards be convicted of any crime, and senten•
ced therefor to confinement in the penitentiary of this state,
' by a court of this Commonwealth, or of the United States, or
« shall be lawfully arrested, and delivered over to the executive
' authority of the United States, or of any state or territory
• thereof, upon a charge of any crime committed out of the
'jurisdiction of this state, and shall thereupon be carried be'
yond the limits of this Commonwealth, such special bail shall
• be discharged from his recognizance, in the same manner as
if such defendant had died at the time of such sentence, or
• of such delivery.'
59. When the sheriff or other proper officer shall return
upon any original or mesne process, that he hath taken the
body of the defendant, and committed him to prison for want
of appearance bail, the plaintiff may proceed, and the defen
dant make his defence, in like manner, as if bis appearance
bail had been entered and accepted. But the defendant shall
not be discharged out of custody, until he shall put vu good
bail, or the plaintiff shall be ruled by the court to accept an
appearance without bail. And, when any defendant, after ap
pearance entered, shall be confined in prison, the plaintiff may
proceed in the same manner as if he were not so confined.^)
60. When the sheriff or other proper officer, returning the
truth of the case, upon any original or mesne process, to him
directed, shall make return, that any defendant is not an inha
bitant of his county or corporation, the suit shall abate and be
dismissed as to such defendant, if the court, from which such
process issued, have jurisdiction over such county or corpora
tion only.(/i)
61. When the sheriff or other proper officer shall return on
any writ of capias, to answer in any civil action, that the de
fendant is not found within his bailiwick, the plaintiff" may
either sue out an alias or a pluries capias, until the defendant
shall be arrested, or a testatum capias, where the defendant
shall have gone into another county or corporation ; or may, at
his election, sue out an attachment against the estate of the
defendant, to force an appearance ; and if the sheriff or other
officer shall return that lie hath attached any goods, and the
-defendant shall not appear and replevy the same, by entering
his appearance and giving special bail, in case he shall be ruled
so to do, the piaintitt' may file his declaration, and proceed to
final judgment, in the same manner as if the defendant had
been arrested. The goods attached shall remain in the hands
of the officer, until sucu final judgment be entered, and then
be sold in the same manner as goods taken upon a. fieri facias.
Ana, il the judgment shall not be thereby satisfied, the plain-
tilf may sue out execution for the residue ; and, in case more
goous be attached than will satisfy the judgment, the surplus
shall De returned to the defendant-(i)
62. VV here any sheriff or other officer shall return, on any
original or mesne process to him directed, that he has been
kept off by force of arms, it shall and may be lawful for the
plaintiff in the action in which the process so returned was
issued, either to issue an alias or pluries, as the case may be,
or to proceed in the said action against the defendaut or defen
dants, as if such process had been returned executed. (k)
63. It any writ or process shall be executed, and, .tor want
of a return thereof to the office from which it is issued, an
alias, pluries, attachment or other process be awarded, the
sheriff snail liot execute such subsequent process, but shall re-
turn the first process by him executed, if it be in his possession
; but, if it be not in his possession, then he shall return
the subsequent process, with an endorsement of the execution
of such first process, and the name of the appearance bail, i
any was taken ; and shall also return a copy of the bail bond,
on which there shall be the same proceedings, as if the said
first process had been duly returned.(i)
64. On the return of the pluries, that the defendant is not
found, the court instead of the process to outlawry formerly
used, may order a proclamation to issue, warning the defendant
to appear on a certain day therein named, or that judg-
ment will be rendered against him ; which proclamation shall
be published on three successive court days, at the door of the
court-house of the county or corporation, to which the last
process was directed, and also three times in some public
newspaper ; and it the defendant fails to appear pursuant to
such proclamation, the same proceedings shall be had, and the
same judgment shall be given as in other cases of default.(m)
65. On writs of scire facias for the renewal of judgments,
no judgment shall be rendered on the return of two nihils,
unless the defendant resides in the county, or unless he be
absent from the Commonwealth, and have no known attorney
therein. But such scire facias may be directed to the sheriti
of any county in the Commonwealth, wherein the defendant or
his attorney shall reside or be found, which being returned
served, the court may proceed to judgment thereupon, as if
the defendant had resided in the county.(re)
66. Where the defendant can be found, writs of scire facias
from any court, shall hereafter be served in the same manner
as wr'ts °f capias respondendum on which no bail is required.
And where the said defendant cannot be found, it
shall be considered as a sufficient service of the said writ, for
t'le sner'ft» or otner office1" to whom the same is directed, to
leave a copy tliereof with the wife of the defendant, or some
free white person above the age of sixteen years, then and
<j,ere being one of the family of the defendant, and found at
his usual place of abode, or to leave a copy thereof at such
place of abode, in the manner prescribed in the next section.(o)
67. Notices on replevin bonds, and on all other legal occa-
8'ons' wnerein no particular mode is or shall be prescribed for
their service, shall be good, if given to the party in person, or
delivered in writing to any free white person above the age of
sixteen years, who, being a member of the family of such per
son, and found at his usual place of abode, shall be informed
of the purport of such notice; or left at some public place, at
the dwelling house, or other known place of residence of such
person, hebeing from home, and no such free white person of
his family being found there, willing to receive such notice ;
and it shall be the duty of the sheriff' or seijeant, whenever
required, to serve all such notices within his bailiwick, and to
ma'{e ^ue return thereof : the service thereof, however, shall be
good, when made by any other person, and verified by affidav'it(p)
68. In all actions or suits which may be commenced against
the Governor of this Commonwealth, any member of the privy
council, any of the judges of the superior courts, or the sheriff"
of any county, during his continuance in office, instead of the
ordinary process, a summons shall issue directed to the sheriff
or other proper officer, reciting the cause of action, and com
manding him to summon such defendant to appear, and answer
the same, on the proper return day : and if such defendant,
being summoned, or after a copy shall have been left at his
usual place of abode, ten days before the return day, shall not
appear to answer the same, the court shall proceed against such
defendant, in the same manner as if he had been taken upon a
capias ad respondendum : Provided, always, That, after judg-
ment and the return of a fieri facias, by the sheriff" of that
c»unty in which the defendant in any such case resides, that
no effects, or not sufficient, are to be found in his bailiwick to
satisfy the said judgment, a. capias ad satisfaciendum maybe
issued as in other cases.(^)

every summons to answer any action, and every subpoena in
chancery, issued from the clerk's office of any such court shall
be returnable, at the option of the plaintiff", either to the first
day of the next succeeding term, or in the clerk's office to
some previous rule day ; and, if it shall be returned not exe-
cuted, any subsequent proper process may issue thereupon
returnable in like manner. All such process may be executed
at any time before the return day shall have passetl.(s)
71. Process to bring the representative or representatives
of any deceased party into court, may be awarded at the rules
i-i r- J . /.\ J
in like manner as in open court.(i)
72. The plaintiff shall file his declaration in the clerk's
office on the rule day at which the writ or other process shall
be returned executed ; or, the defendant having entered his
appearance, may give a rule for the plaintiff1 to declare ; which
it he fails or neglects to do, at the succeeding rule day, or
shall at any time fail to prosecute his suit, he shall be nonsuit
ed, and pay to the defendant or tenant, besides his costs, five
dollarsir)
73. When the plaintiff hath filed his declaration, he may
give a rule to plead with the clerk; and if the defendant shall
not plead accordingly, at the expiration of such rule, the plain-
tiff may enter judgment for his debt or damages and costs,
and have a writ of enquiry awarded where one shall be neces-
sary.(w)
74. All rules to declare, plead, reply, rejoin, or for other
proceedings, shall be given regularly from month to month,
shall be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and shall
expire on the succeeding rule day.(w)
75. No discontinuance of any cause shall take place for
failure to take any rule therein, during any vacancy in the
office of clerk of the court, in which such cause may be depending
; but all causes on the rule docket, shall stand con
tinued, until the rule day after the vacancy shall be filled ; and
all process issued before, but not returnable till after such va-t
cancy happened, shall be returnable to the same rule-day.^)

court of law, and before every quarterly term of a eounty or
corporation court, the clerk shall enter, In a particular docket,
separate and distinct from the rule docket, and, in the county
court, separate and distinct from the chancery docket, all those
causes and those only, in which there is an issue to be tried, or
an enquiry of damages to be made, or an office judgment which
may be set aside, or a special verdict, case agreed, demurrer,
or other matter of law, or other question before the court, is to
be argued or decided. He shall docket the causes, in the
order in which they are put to issue, or writs of enquiry are
awarded, or office judgments rendered in them; and no cause
shall be removed from its place on the docket, unless when,0
being called for trial, it shall be continued at the plaintiff's
motion, in which case, it shall be put at the end of the docket,
unless the defendant consent that it shall retain its place.

011 *ne docket, to so many days, and in such numbers to
each day, as may be deemed most expedient; and he shall

the causes stand for tr\a\.(y)
77. Every judgment entered in the office against any defendant,
or against any defendant and bail, or against any de-
fendant aud sheriff, shall be set aside, if the defendant, at the
succeeding term of the general court, or a superior court of
law, or at the succeeding quarterly term of a county or corpo
ration court, shall be allowed to appear without bail, put in
good bail, being ruled so to do, or surrender himself in custody,
and shall plead to issue immediately: Provided, however,
no such office judgment shall be set aside, at any time,
after a writ of enquiry awarded thereupon shall have been
executed, unless good cause be shewn therefor. The court
shall have control over all other proceedings in the office, dur-
tne Preceding vacation, may correct any mistakes or errors,
which may have happened therein, and may, for good cause
shewn, set aside any of the said rules or proceedings, and
make such order concerning the same, as may be just and
right. They may also, for good cause shewn, re-instate any
cau9e discontinued during such preceding vacation.^z)
78. Any new issue made up, on setting aside an office judg-
ment, unless good cause be shewn for a continuance, may be
tried at the same term. And any writ of enquiry awarded at
rules> may be executed at the next succeeding court, and
final judgment be rendered thereupon, unless good cause be
shewn for a continuance.(a)

the covenants or agreements as lie may think fit : upon which,
a jury shall be summoned, to enquire of the truth of eveiy one
of those breaches, and to assess the damages the plaintiff shall
have sustained thereby ; and execution shall issue for so much ;
and the judgment shall remain as a security to the plaintiff,
his executors and administrators, for any other breaches which
may afterwards happen ; and he or they may have a scire facias

debt or scire facias upon a judgment, or in debt upon a bond,
if, before action brought, the defendant hath paid the principal
and interest due by the defeasance or condition, he may plead
payment in bar.(p)
85. If any action be brought on a bond or other writing, filed
in any suit brought thereupon in any other court of this Com-wh
monwealth, it shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to file with
his declaration a copy of such bond or other writing, attested
by the clerk of the court in which the original may be filed ;
and the defendant or defendants shall be obliged to plead
thereto, in like manner as if the original- bond or writing was
filed, and such copy shall be admitted as' evidence on the trial.
however, the defendant or defendants shall plead, that the
original bond or writing is not his, her or their deed, the clerk
°^ *he cour* having such original paper in his custody, shall, on
being summoned as a witness, attend with the same, on the
of the issue, for the inspection of the jury.(/)

the several items of his claim against the defendant; and,*in
fa^ure thereof, he shall not be entitled to prove, before the
jUI7» any item, which is not so plainly and particularly
described in the declaration, as to give the defendant full
notice of the character thereof.'
87. « In every action in which a defendant shall desire to
Prove an7 payment or set-off, he shall file with his plea an
account, stating distinctly the nature of such payment or
set-off, and the several items thereof ; and in failure to do so,
he shall not be entitled to prove before the jury, such payment
or set-off, unless the same be so plainly and particularly
described in the plea, as to give the plaintiff full notice of the
character thereof.'*
g8. The plaintiff in replevin, and the defendant in all other
may plead as many several matters, whether of law
or of fact, as he shall think necessary for his defenc e.(^)t
89. In controversies affecting lands, tenements or heredita-

be granted from the judgment or not, it shall be the duty of the
clerk to enter, in books to be kept for that purpose, all the
pleadings and papers filed as evidence therein, and the judg
ment thereupon, so as to make a complete record thereof: and
those, wherein the title or bounds of land is determined, shall

VI.—For remedying certain defects in proceedings in courts.*
100. Be it enacted, That, in all personal actions, where the
declaration shall plainly set forth sufficient matter of substance,
for the court to proceed upon the merits of the cause, the suit
shall not abate for want of form.(i)
101. Where a demurrer shall be joined, in any action, the
court shall not regard any other defect or imperfection in the
writ, return, declaration or pleadings, than what shall be spe
cially alleged in the demurrer as causes thereof, unless
something so essential to the action or defence, as that judg
ment, according to law, and the very right of the cause, cannot
be given, be omitted.(m)
102. After issue joined in an ejectment, on the title only,
no exception of form or substance, shall be taken to the decla-
ration, in any court whatsoever.(n)

entered by nildicit, or non sum informatus, be reversed, nor i
judgment, after enquiry of damages, be stayed or reversed,
for any omission or fault, which would not have been a good
cause to stay or reverse the judgment, if there had been a

' in vacation, to amend such judgment or decree thereby ac-
' cording to the very truth and justice of the case : Provided,
That the opposite party, his agent, or attorney in fact, or at
law, shall have had reasonable notice of the application for
such amendment. And, if the transcript of such judgment
'or decree, at the time of such amendment, or at any time
thereafter, shall be removed to the court of appeals, it shall

on such record .'(t)
109. ' Where any bond, taken by virtue of any distress for
rent or execution, by miscalculation or mistake, shall be con-

shall be rendered for more damages than the plaintiff shall
have demanded by his suit, and judgment shall be rendered
accordingly, and the court in which such judgment shall be
rendered, shall have adjourned to another term, without re-
lease of such excess having been made, it shall be lawful for
the plaintiff, at any time before the record of such judgment
shall be removed into an appellate court, at any future term
of the court in which such judgment shall be rendered, to
release in open court any such excess ; or he may in vacation
release the same by deed under his hand and seal, witnessed
by the clerk or deputy clerk of such court, and filed of record
among the papers of the cause; and such release, made in
either of the forms aforesaid, shall cure any error growing out
of such excess.'(t)
110. ' If the record of any such judgment shall be removed
into an appellate court, before such release shall be made, f
shall be competent for the defendant in error to make such
release as aforesaid in the appellate court ; and thereupon the
said court, after reversing the judgment, shall proceed to give
such judgment as the court below ought to have given if the
release had been filed therein.'(i)

act may apply; Be it further enacted, That all things

!• Where a husband doth lose the lands of his wife by de
fault, it is unreasonable that the wife, after the death of her
husband, should have no other recovery but by writ of right :
g. £E n therefore enacted by the General Assembly, That a
woman, after the death of her husband, shall not be injured by
such default, but shall, ' not withstanding, retain her right of
entry, and may prosecute the same by any real or mixed
action that may best suit the case. If the tenant shall object
to the wife's claim, that he entered by judgment, and it be
found that his entry was by default, to which he shall answer,
if required, he shall then further answer and shew his right in
like manner as in the writ he first purchased against the
husband and wife ; and if he can shew such right, the wife
shall gain nothing by her writ ; but if the husband absent himself
and will not defend his wife's right, or, against the wife's

person, it shall be lawful for the clerk, at his office, on affidavit

t,le Peace of the state' territorv or district in which the witness

of whom in either case may proceed to execute the said com
mission : Provided nevertheless, That reasonable notice shall be
given to the party, of the time and place of taking such depo
sitions. The costs of giving notices, as aforesaid, as well as of
taking any deposition or depositions, in any or either of the
United States, or territories, or district thereof, or beyond sea,

jurisdiction in the case of such will, for probat, and any witness
or witnesses attesting the same shall reside out of this Common
wealth, it shall be lawful for such court to issue a commis
sion, or commissions annexed to such will, and directed to the
presiding judge of any court of law, to any notary public,
mayor or other chief magistrate of any city, town or corpora
tion, or county, or to such other person or persons as, by the
laws of such country where such witness or witnesses may be
found, are duly authorised to administer an oath, empowering
him or them to take and certify their attestations. If the per
son, to whom such commission shall be directed, shall certify,
in the manner such acts are usually authenticated by him or
them, that the witness or witnesses personally appeared before
him or them, and made oath, or affirmed, as the case may
require, that the testator signed and published the writing,
annexed to such commission, as his last will and testament, or
that some other person signed it by his direction, that he was
of disposing mind and memory, and that he or they subscribed
their names thereto in his presence, and at his request, such
oath or affirmation shall have the same operation, and the will
be recorded in like manner, as if such oath or affirmation had
been made in the court from whence such commission issued.fr)
21. And, whereas great inconvenience may arise to the
suitors in the several courts of this Commonwealth, who are
litigant with persons residing without this Commonwealth, and
have not agents or attornies within the same, by the death or
removal of witnesses, whose depositions cannot legally be
taken for want of notice to such absent persons ;(w)
Be it therefore enacted, That, when any commission shall
be obtained to take the deposition of a witness in a suit de-
pending in any of the courts of this Commonwealth, where
the plaintiff or defendant in such suit doth not reside within
the same, or hath not an attorney within the same, to; whom
notice of the time and place of taking such deposition can be
given, then-the person obtaining such commission, having pub
lished in some public newspaper printed within this Common
wealth, four weeks successively, the time and place, when and
where the witness is to be examined, and the name of the
witness, together with the names of the parties to the suit ia
which such witness is to be examined, it shall and may be law-
ful for any plaintiff or defendant, as aforesaid, to proceed to
take any deposition authorised by the commission issuing from
the court, agreeably to law, where the suit depends ns afore
said ; and such deposition, when taken and returned to the
clerk's office, agreeably to the rules of the court from whence
the commission issued, shall there be filed, and allowed to
be read in evidence, in the same manner and under the like re
striction's, as if notice had been duly given to the opposite party;
any law, usage or custom, to the contrary in any wise, notwith
standing. And the printer may demand and receive the sum
of two dollars for publishing such advertisement four weeks,
which shall be taxed in the bill of costs, if the party chargea
ble therewith shall prevail in the suit,(a?)
22. All and every act and acts, clauses and parts of acts,
for, or concerning any matter or thing within the purview of
this act, shall be, and the same are hereby repealed : Provided,
That all rights, remedies and proceedings, fines and penalties,
accrued, commenced or incurred, before the commencement of

same may be now taken by magistrates of the citj', and which
shall be considered as valid and effectual as if the same were
taken or received by the said magistrates ;t and, if any person
sworn by a notary public shall give any evidence under such
circumstances as would have constituted the same to be perjury
if done before a magistrate, the same shall be deemed perjury,
to all intents and purposes. The said notaries, for receiving
or taking the affidavits or depositions of witnesses, shall be
allowed and paid by the person, at whose instance the service
are rendered, seventy -five cents for each affidavit or depositio

an exception, praying that the justices will allow it, if they will
not allow it, and he that allegeth the exception, do, write the
same exception, and require that the justices will put their
seals in testimony thereof, the justices, or the greater part of
them present, shall so do ; and if such higher court, upon
complaint made of the said justices, cause the record to come

and the plaintiff shew the exception written, with the seals of
the justices put to it, the justices shall be commanded, that
they appear at a certain day, either to confess or deny their
seals ; and, if the justices cannot deny their seals, it shall pro

before whom such prosecution is pending, to sign and seal any
bill of exceptions tendered to the court during the progress

at a future day ; but shall levy the same immediately, ana
keep in his hands the goods and chattels taken thereupon, until
he shall have sold sufficient thereof to raise the money and to
bacco mentioned in the execution, or the same be otherwise
satisfied : and for the better direction of such officer, the clerk
shall endorse upon every such execution, that no security of
any kind is to be taken.{r)\
17. If any sheriff or other officer shall fail to deliver to the
creditor, his agent or attorney, or other legal representative, on
demand, any bond taken for the forthcoming of property, or to
return the same to the office from whence it issued, on the re-
turn day* of the execution, such sheriff or other officer, his executors
or administrators, shall be liable to the same fine and
penalty, for every month of such failure, to be recovered in the
same manner by the party injured, as is directed by law against
a sheriff failing to return an execution.(s)t

the obligee or obligees in such bond, besides his or their remedy
against the sheriff or other officer, may moreover have execu-

forthcoming bond had never been taken.(t)

-taken by virtue of any writ of execution, but he shall not de,nan
or receive sucn commission, unless the same shall be

20. When execution shall issue against the estate of any
sheriff, under sheriff, sergeant of a corporation, coroner or constable,
or their securities, or the heirs, executors or adminis-
trators of either of them, upon a judgment obtained against
such sheriff, under sheriff, sergeant of a corporation, coroner
or constable, or securities, or the heirs, executors or adminis
trators of either of them, for money or tobacco received by such
sheriff, under sheriff, sergeant of a corporation, coroner or con
stable, by virtue of any execution or process, levied or execut

them in any manner, as sheriffs, sergeants, coroners, or consta
bles, no security, for payment of the money or tobacco, men
tioned in such execution, at a future day, or to have the goods
forthcoming at the day of sale, shall be taken or received ; but,
the officer taking such estate in execution, shall proceed im
mediately to the sale thereof, notwithstanding such security
shall be tendered ; and for the better direction of such officer,
the clerk issuing such execution shall endorse thereon, that wo
security of any kind is to be taken. In like manner, * on all
executions upon judgments obtained by any sheriff, his heirs, exor
administrators, against any deputy and his securi-
ties, their heirs, executors or administrators, or either of them,'
and on all executions which may issue against any collector of
*'le P00r rates, his heirs, executors or administrators, or against
any overseer or overseers of the poor, his or their heirs, execu
tors or administrators, on any judgment obtained, or which may
hereafter be obtained, against him or them, for, or on account of
any money or tobacco, which have or may hereafter come to
his or their hands, levied for the support of the poor, the clerk
shall endorse no security to be taken.(w)

yflc{as sna}] De directed, shall take in execution any slave or
slaves, unless the debt and costs mentioned in such fieri facias
shall amount to the sum of thirty -three dollars, or two thousand
pounds of tobacco ; Provided, There be shewn to such sheriff

other goods or chattels of such defendant, within the bailiwick
of such sheriff or officer, upon which he may levy the debt and
costs mentioned in such fieri facias.{x)

23. If the goods taken by any sheriff or other officer, or any R
part thereof, shall remain in his hands unsold, he shall make
return accordingly ; and, thereupon, the clerk of the • court
from whence the execution issued, shall and may, and he is
hereby required to issue a venditioni exponas, to such sheriff
or other officer directed ; whereupon, the like proceedings
shall be had as might and ought to have been had on the first
execution ; which writ of venditioni exponas shall be in the
form following :
The Commonwealth, £%c. greeting : We command you that
you expose to sale those goods and chattels of A. B., to the value
of , which, according to our command, you have taken, and
which remain in your hands unsold, as you have certified to
our judges [or justices,) of our court, to satisfy C. D.
the sum of , whereof, in our said court, he hath re
covered execution, against the said A. B., by virtue of a judg
ment in the said court, and that you have, $c.{z)
24- When any sheriff, or other officer, shall serve any writ
of execution on slaves, horses, or any live stock, and the same
shall not be immediately restored to the debtor, it shall and
may be lawful for such officers, and they are hereby required to
firovide sufficient sustenance for the support of such slaves or
ive stock, until such slaves or stock be sold, or otherwise legally
discharged from such execution. And the county and corpo-
ration courts within this Commonwealth shall be, and they are
respectively authorised and empowered, in the months of May
and October, in each and every year, to settle and adjust the
compensation to be allowed to sheriffs and other officers within
their respective counties and corporations, for supporting
slaves or live stock, taken by them as aforesaid, till the same
be sold or otherwise legally discharged from such execution :
Provided, The allowance so made shall not exceed twenty
cents per day for each slave, seventeen cents per day for each
horse or mule, nine cents per day for each head of horned
cattle or hog, and six cents per day for every sheep or goat ;
which allowance such sheriff or other officer snail charge to the
plaintiff, to be collected in the same manner as commissions
arising on executions, and shall be paid by the defendant to the
plaintiff, to be taxed in the bills of costs by the said sheriff or
other officer.(a)
25. If any sheriff or other officer shall levy an execution
on property, and a doubt shall arise whether the right of such
property is in the debtor or not, such sheriff or officer mayd
apply to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, for his bond, with
good security, payable to the high sheriff of the county, or
other officer, and conditioned to indemnify the said sheriff or
other officer, against all damages, which he may sustain, in
consequence of the seizure or sale of the property on which
*'ie execut'on s'ia" ^ave been levied; and, moreover, to pay
and satisfy to any person or persons, claiming title to such
property, all damages which such person or persons may sus
tain in consequence of such seizure or sale, which, if the plain
tiff, his attorney or agent, shall refuse or fail to give, on or
before the day of sale, the sheriff or other officer shall be
justifiable in delivering such property to the party from whose
possession it was taken : Provided, however, That such proper^

issued, and any person claiming such property, may, in the
name of such high sheriff, or other officer, prosecute his or her
su't uPon tne bond, anl* recover such damages as a jury may
assess.(c)
2r. The party claiming such property shall, after the due
execution of such bond, be barred of his right of action,
aSa'ns* the sheriff or other officer levying such execution, unless
the obligors in the said bond shall become insolvent.(d)
28. Where any writ of capias ad satisfaciendum has been
or silau De served on any debtor, it shall be lawful for such
debtor to tender to the sheriff or other officer serving the same,
slaves or personal property to the value of the debt and costs,
for which such execution has issued, or may hereafter issue,
which property the said sheriff or other officer shall receive
and proceed to sell in like manner as is herein directed, in the
case of goods taken in execution upon a writ of Jim- facias,
aT1(j shall thereupon discharge such debtor out of custody :
Provided always, That, if such property, so tendered, shall
m^ ^e sufficient to satisfy the debt or damages, and costs, or
shall be under any lien or incumbrance, so as that the whole
cannot be sold, a new capias ad satisfaciendum, or fieri facias,
at the option of the plaintiff, shall issue for any balance, and
the clerk of the court, from which such execution originally
issued, shall, upon the return of the sheriff of the insufficiency
or incumbrance, as aforesaid, issue a new capias ad satisfaciendum,
or fieri facias, if required. But, where such pro
perty shall have been under any incumbrance, the debtor shall
not be at liberty to tender slaves or personal estate on a second
capias ad satisfaciendum being served, or, in case of a. fieri
facias issued in consequence of such return, to avail himself
of the privileges of this act.(e)

for which the said execution was issued, and the person against
whom such execution may have issued, his executors or ad-
ministrators, shall obtain an injunction to such execution, or
for any part of the money or tobacco mentioned therein,
before the money or tobacco so received by such sheriff" or
officer is paid to the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, or his ex
ecutors or administrators, in every such case, the sheriff or
other officer, his executors or administrators, shall repay the
person or persons, against whom such execution issued, his or
their executors, administrators or agent, the money or tobacco
so received, or such part thereof as may be injoined ; and i
any sheriff or other officer, his or their executors or administra-<
tors, shall fail or refuse, when required, to pay such sum o
money or tobacco, so received and injoined, to the person
having a right to demand the same, such sheriff or other officer,
and their securities, his and their executors, and administrators,
and every of them, shall be liable to the like penalty and
judgment, in favor of the person, his executors or administra
tors, by whom the said injunction is obtained, as is directed by
law, in favor of the plaintiff, against the sheriff, for not paying
the money or tobacco levied on an execution.(/)*

will render his, her or their body or bodies to prison, in satisfac
tion of such execution, at or before the expiration of one year
from the date of such bond ; it shall be lawful for the sheriff or
other officer, in whose custody such prisoner or prisoners shall
be, to permit him, her or them to go out of the prison and return
at his, her or their pleasure, during one year after the date of
such bond ; after the expiration of which time, if the person or
persons so taken or charged in execution, shall not have been
discharged by due course of law, ' and shall not have rendered
' his, her or their body or bodies to prison, according to the
' condition of such bond, the sheriff or other officer of the
1 county or corporation, where such prisoner or prisoners were
' in custody, shall immediately proceed in the, same manner,
' and the creditor, at whose suit he, she or they was or were
* in custody, shall be entitled to the same remedies, as aret
« prescribed by law in relation to prisoners escaping and going
' out of the prison rules. And if the person or persons so
* charged in custody shall render his, her or their body or
* bodies to prison, according to the condition of such bond, or
1 shall be taken and committed to jail on an escape warrant,
' after the expiration of the time during which he, she or they
« was or were entitled to the benefit of the rules or bounds of
'the prison, such prisoner or prisoners shall thereafter be
' closely confined in jail, and' shall not be discharged, until
the debt or demand for which he, she or they was or were
taken or charged in execution shall be paid, or until he, she or
they shall have taken and subscribed the oath and schedule,
and shall have made the delivery and transfer of his, her or
their property as required by law for the discharge of insol
vent aebtors.(g')*
31. And for the relief of insolvent debtors, who shall be
taken in execution, and to prevent the long imprisonment of
unfortunate people, which can be of no benefit, but rather a
disadvantage to their creditors : Be it further enacted, That, if
any person hereafter be taken or charged in execution, in any
suit commenced or prosecuted in any court of record within
this Commonwealth, it shall be lawful for any judge or justice
0f the said court, or of the court of that county or corpocation
to whose jail such person shall be committed, by warrant under
his hand and seal, to command the jailor or keeper of the said
prison, to bring before the said court, if sitting, or, if not sitting,
before any two justices of the county or corporation, to whose
jail he may be committed, at the court-house of such county
or corporation, on a certain day to be appointed by such
warrant, the body or bodies of such person or persons so in •

which warrant such jailor is hereby required to obey, and
reasonable notice thereof shall be given to the party or parties,
his or their executors, administrators or agents, at whose suit
sucn Prisoner or prisoners shall be in execution. And every
such prisoner, coming before the said court, or justices, as the
case shall be, shall subscribe and deliver in a schedule of his
wh0]e estate, and make oath and swear, that is to say : /, A- B.
do, in the presence of Almighty God, solemnly swear or affirm,
(as the case may be,) that the schedule now delivered and by
me subscribed, doth contain, to the best of my knowledge and
remembrance, a full, just, true and perfect account and dis
covery of all the estate, goods and effects unto me, in any ways
belonging, and such debts as are to me owing, or to any person
in trust for me ; and of all securities and contracts, whereby
any money may hereafter become payable, or any benefit or ad
vantage accrue to me, or to my use, or to any other person or
persons in trust for me ; and that I, or any other person or
persons in trust for me, have not land, money, stock, or any
other estate, real or personal, in possession, reversion, or re
mainder, of the value of the debt, or debts with which J am
chargedin execution ; and that I have not, directly or indirectly
sold, lessened or otherwise disposed of in trust, or concealed,
all, or any part of my lands, money, goods, stocks, debts, secu
rities, contracts, or estate, whereby to secure the same ; or to
receive or expect any profit or advantage therefrom; or to defraud
or deceive any creditor, or creditors, to whom I am in-
debted in any wise howsoever. So help me GoD.(h) And shall,
moreover, before he shall be discharged, under the directions
of the court or persons before whom such oath of insolvency
shall be taken, transfer, and deliver all the personal estate
contained in such schedule, and convey all the real estate
therein, to the sheriff of the county where they lie or shall be
found, to be by him disposed of according to law, which
schedule being so subscribed in open court, if taken in court,
and if not, in the presence of two justices, shall, if taken in
the court from whence the execution issu ed, be retained by the
clerk of such court, there to remain for the information of the
creditors. But when such oath shall be administered in any
other court, than that from which such execution issued, the
clerk of the court shall in like manner retain the original
schedule, but shall deliver to the sheriff" or other officer a certified
copy thereof, to be returned to the office from whence
such execution issued, to have there the same force and effect,
that the original would have if returned with the execution,
Anil, if the oath shall be taken before two justices of the peace
it shall be the duty of the sheriff, or other officer, from whose
custody he shall be discharged, to return the schedule subscri
bed and delivered in, by such insolvent debtor, to the office
from which such execution issued : Provided always, That, if
there be more than one execution, the schedule shall be return
ed with that which came first to the officer's hands. And it
shall moreover be, the duty of such sheriff, or other officer, to
make a return to each office from which any other execution
issued, under which such insolvent debtor may have been com
mitted, stating the truth of the case, and specifying the office
to which such schedule may have been returned.(i)
32. * If any sheriff or other officer shall fail to make the
* returns hereby required, or any of them, within thirty days&
■ after such schedule is rendered and oath taken, he shall be
' fined, at the motion of the plaintiff in each of the said exe-
* cutions, in the same manner and to the same extent, as for a
' failure to return such execution.'(fc)*
53. After delivering in such schedule, and taking such
oath, such prisoner shall be discharged by warrant from suchch
court, or from two justices, (as the case may be ;) which war-g
rant shall be sufficient to indemnify such sheriffor other officer
against any escape or escapes, action or actions whatsoever,
which shall or may be brought or prosecuted against him or
them by reason thereof. And, if any action shall be commenc-Off
ed against any sheriff or officer, for performing his duty inP
pursuance of this act, he may plead the general issue, and give j
this act in evidence : Provided, always, That; notwithstanding
9Ucn discharge, it shall be lawful for any creditor, or creditors,
judgment at any time afterwards, to sue out a writ of scire
to have execution against any lands or tenements, goods
chattels, which such insolvent person shall thereafter acqUire
or be possessed of. But, no person delivering in such
and having taken the said oath, shall again be imprion
account of any judgment which shall have been
obtained against him previous to the time of taking such oath ;
unjess by virtue 0f a capias ad satisfaciendum, directed to
issue by the court in which the said judgment shall have been
rendered. And it shall moreover be lawful for the court, from
w'1'0'1 an^ execution shall issue, under which such oath of
insolvency shall be taken by any debtor, on motion to award
execution against the goods and chattels by him or her acquir
ed after taking such oath : Provided, That the defendant shall
have ten days previous notice of such motion.(i)
34. All the estate which shall be contained in such schedule>
and any other estate which may be discovered to belong
^Q yle pr;soner) for sucn interest therein as such prisoner hath,
and may lawfully depart withal, shall be vested in the sheriff
of the county wherein such lands, tenements, goods or chattels
shall lie or be found ; and such sheriff is hereby authoris-
ed, empowered and required, within sixty days after the tak
ing the said oath, ten days previous notice of the time and
place of sale being given, to sell and convey the same to any
person or persons, whatsoever, for the best price that can be
got for the same ; and the money arising from such sale shall
be, by such sheriff or officer, paid to the creditor or creditors,
at whose suit such prisoner or prisoners shall be imprisoned ;
saving to every sucli prisoner, his or her necessary apparel
and utensils of trade. And, if any sheriff or other officer shall
^ *° Pay *ne money arising from such sale according to law,
shall be liable to the same penalty, to be recovered in the
same manner, and by the same persons, as if the said money
na(j Deen ievie(j Dy a fieri facias.(m)*
35. When any insolvent debtor shall be discharged pursuant
to this act, and the schedule subscribed and delivered in
Dv sucn prisoner shall contain articles of money or tobacco,
due to such prisoner, or goods, chattels, or estates belonging to
him» and in the possession of any other, in that case the clerk
of the court, with whom such schedule is directed to remain,
may, at the instance of the creditor, issue a summons against
each of the persons named as debtors, to have possession of
any goods, chattels, or estates, of the property of the prisoner,
reciting the sum of money or the quantity of tobacco, he or
she is charged with, or the particular goods, chattels or estates
said to be in his possession, and requiring him or her to appear
at the next court, and to declare on oath, whether the sai
money or tobacco, or any part thereof, be really due to such
process, at whose instance the same was issued. And all offi- o
cer's fees in such prosecution shall be charged to such creditor,
And, if the person so summoned shall fail to attend accord-J
ing to such summons, or to shew good cause for his non-attendance,
it shall be lawful for the court to enter judgment against
every such person, for the money, tobacco, goods, chattels, or
estates in such schedule mentioned, together with costs of suit,c
a lawyer's fee excepted ; and, if any such person so summoned
shall appear and be sworn, judgment shall be entered for so
much of the money, tobacco, goods, chattels or estates, as hei
or she shall acknowledge to be due, or to be of the property of
such prisoner, and in his possession, with costs as aforesaid,
which judgment shall be entered in the name of the sheriff,
who may thereupon proceed to levy the executions, as in otherE
cases, and to dispose of the money, tobacco, goods, chattels or
estates so recovered, in the same manner as the estate con
tained in the schedule is hereby directed to be disposed of.(w)
36. Provided, always, That, where any such garnishee
shall not acknowledge the whole money, or tobacco to be due,J
or all the goods, chattels, or estates mentioned in the schedule,
to be of the property of the prisoner, and in his possession, thes
sheriff or such prisoner, at any time after, unless barred by
any of the acts limiting the time for the commencement of
actions, shall be at liberty to claim the residue by ljgal pro
cess ; and the former judgment as to such garnishee, shall be
no further bar to such process than for so much money or
tobacco, or sach goods, chattels and estates, as the garnishee is
thereby ordered to pay or deliver.(n)
37. If any garnishee shall, at the time of executing such
summons, tender to the officer executing the same, the money,
goods or chattels mentioned therein, or any part thereof, it
shall be the duty of such officer to receive the same, and give
a receipt therefor; and any goods and chattels, thus received,
shall be sold by such officer in the same manner as goods and
chattels taken in execution : Provided always, That, where all
the money, goods or chattels mentioned in such summons shall
not be paid or delivered to such officer as aforesaid, like pro
ceedings may be had for the residue, as in cases where no part
is paid or delivered.(o)
38. If any sheriff or other officer shall receive any money,
goods or chattels in pursuance of the above section, and shall
fail to return the summons, or make a false return thereon, or
shall fail to pay the money by him received, he shall be liable
te the same recovery as for like delinquency in the case of an
execution.* And the court, before whom such motion may be
made, shall estimate the value of any goods or chattels named
in such summons, and assess the fine accordingly.(p)
39. If the garnishee shall pay the money, or so much thereof
as may be due, or shall deliver the goods and chattels, in his or
^er 'ian<^8' *° sneriff or other officer, at the time of executing
the summons, such garnishee shall not be liable to costs ;
but the legal costs, together with a commission of five per
centum to the officer collecting the same, shall be paid out of
such insolvent debtor's estate.^)
40. Any of the creditors may proceed against the garnishee
or garnishees, or either of them, ' but he shall thereby acquire
' n0 preference to the money or other thing sued for,' except
that, out of the subject recovered, it shall be the duty of the
sheriff, in whose name the claim is prosecuted, to pay to him.
his costs expended in the prosecution.(r)
41. Every sheriff shall be allowed to retain, out of the effects
0f such insolvent debtor, all reasonable expenses in recovering
sucn moneTj tobacco, goods, chattels and estates a9 aforesaid,
including such a fee to a lawyer, for the proceeding against
the garnishee, as shall be judged reasonable by the court; and
if such effects be not sufficient, he shall be reimbursed such
expenses, by such creditor as would have been entitled to re
ceive the thing sued for ; or, if there be more than one so
entitled, then by such creditors in proportion to the debts due
them.(s)
42. Where such insolvent person shall not be able to satisfy
and pay his ordinary prison fees, the sheriff or jailor may
demand and receive ot the party, or parties, at whose suit such
insolvent person shall be imprisoned, all such fees as shall
become flue, until such creditor shall agree to release such
prisoner ; and, if the creditor, upon notice given to him or her,
]u8 or ner attorney or agent, shall refuse to give security to the
sheriff or jailor, for the payment of such prison fees, or shall
fail to pay the same when demanded, such sheriff or jailor
shall discharge such debtor out of prison. And whenever a
creditor shall be liable to a jailor for prison fees, on account of
his debtor, it shall and may be lawful for such jailor, to charge
the same fees as may be charged against the Commonwealth,
by virtue of the act, entitled, Jin act to reduce, into one, the
several acts concerning the method of prosecuting free persons
charged with certain crimes, declaring the mode of proceeding
on indictments, informations, and prosecutions on penal sta
tutes; and for preventing vexatious and malicious prosecutions
and moderating amercements. And it shall be lawful for any
jailor to demand, at the end of every three months, of the
creditor at whose suit the debtor is in custody, or his agent,
where by law the creditor is now liable, the amount of his
account for maintenance of such debtor: and, in case such
creditor shall fail to make immediate payment thereof, it shall
be lawful for such jailor, upon giving ten days notice to such
creditor, or his agent, to recover, by motion to the court of which
he is jailor, the amount thereof ; and the clerk of the court,
Derore whom such judgment shall be had, shall endorse upon
any execution issued thereon, that no security is to be taken ;
and, if the sheriff or other officer shall make return, on two
several executions, that he cannot make the amount therein
mentioned, it shall and may be lawful for such jailor to dis-
charge such debtor out of his custody : but nothing in this, or
any other act, is to be construed so as to compel any creditor
to pay for the maintenance of his debtor, or the jailor to support
him, when such debtor hath taken the benefit of the prison
bounds.(t)
43. Provided, nevertheless, That such insolvent prisoner
shall be afterwards liable to the action of the creditor to recover
such fees; and such creditor shall and may, notwithstand-
ing his consent to the releasing such prisoner, at any time afterwards
sue out a scire facias to have a new execution against the
lands and tenements, goods and chattels of such prisoner.(r)
44. Every person on whom any fine or amercement has been
or hereafter shall be imposed by the judgment of any court,
and who by such judgment is directed to stand committed
Hntil the fine or amercement is paid, or who is or shall be in
custody by virtue of any capias pro fine, or execution on be-
half of the Commonwealth, may take the oath of insolvency
in the same manner as is now directed by law in the case of
insolvent debtors, and shall thereupon be discharged out of
custody: Provided, nevertheless, That nothing in this act con-
tained shall be so construed as to comprehend cases, when,
by the judgment of any court, a certain period of imprison-
ment is imposed as a punishment ; but, in every such case, the
party shall remain in custody, until such period is expired, or
until he or she shall be otherwise discharged by due course of
law.(tt--)
45; When any debtor is in custody on several executions,
it shall not be lawful for such debtor to demand any more or
other dieting than if he was in custody on one execution only ;
nor shall any sheriff or jailor demand or receive more than the
rate fixed by law, in case of a debtor confined on one execution
only ; which shall be paid by the creditor, at whose suit
such debtor was first taken.(a?)
46. If a distringas issue in detinue, the court, for good
cause shewn, may direct it to be superseded, so far as it relates
to the specific thing, and to be executed for the alternative
price or value only, if fixed in the judgment, or if the same
shall afterwards be fixed by a writ of enquiry.^/)
47. And whereas doubts have arisen, in what manner judgment
should be rendered, against any sheriff, coroner or ser-
jeant of a corporation, who shall fail to return an execution to
the office from whence it issued, on or before the return day
thereof; Be it enacted, That where any writ of execution, or
attachment for not performing a decree in chancery, shall come
into the possession of any sheriff, coroner, Serjeant of a corpotion,
or other officer, and he shall fail to return the same to the
office from whence it was issued, on or before the return day
thereof, it shall be lawful for the court, ten days' previous
notice being given, upon the motion of the party injured, to
fine such sheriff, coroner, Serjeant of a corporation, or other
officer, or the executors or administrators of such sheriff, coro
ner, serjeant or other officer, as well as the securities of such
sheriff, coroner, serjeant or other officer, and the executors or
administrators of such securities, at their discretion, in any
sum not exceeding five dollars per month, for every hundred
dollars contained in the judgment or decree, on which the
execution or attachment, so by him detained, was founded ;
and so in proportion for any greater or lesser sum, counting
the aforesaid months, from the return day of the execution or
attachment, to the day of rendering judgment for the said
fine.(«)*
48. If any sheriff, under-sheriff or other officer, shall make
upon any writ of fieri facias or venditioni exponas,
^ jey^e(j ,lamages or costs, as in Such Writ
is required, or any part thereof, and shall not immediately pay
the same to the party, to whom the same is payable, or his
attorney ; or shall return, upon any writ of capias ad satisfa
ciendum, or attachment for not performing a decree in chan
cery, for payment of any sum of money or tobacco, that he
hath taken the body or bodies of the defendant or defendants,
and hath the same ready to satisfy the money and tobacco in
such writ mentioned, and shall have actually received such,
money or tobacco of the defendant or defendants, or have
suffered him, her or them to escape, with the consent of such
sheriff, under-sheriff or officer, and shall not immediately pay
gucji money or tobacco t0 t|le party to whom the same is pay
or his attorney; ' or shall make any other return, upon
anv such execution, as will shew that such sheriff, under-
' sheriff or other officer, hath voluntarily, and without authority,
< omitted to levy the same, or as would entitle the plaintiff to
, recover from sucn sheriff or other officer, by action of debt,
* the debt, damages or costs in such execution mentioned, and
« such sheriff or other officer shall not immediately pay the
• same to the party to whom it is payable, or to his attorney ;'
then, or in either of the said cases, it shall and may be lawful
for the creditor, at whose suit such writ of fieri facias, vendi-r
tioni exponas, capias ad satisfaciendum, or attachment, shall
issue, upon a motion made in the next succeeding general
court, or other court from whence such writ shall issue, to
demand judgment against such sheriff, under-sheriff or other
officer, or the « securities of either of them, or their legal re'
presentatives jointly,' for the money or tobacco mentioned in
such writ, or so much as shall be returned levied on such writs
of fieri facias or -enditioni exponas, with interest thereon, at
the rate of fifteen per centum per annum, from the return day
of the execution, until the judgment shall be discharged ; and
such courtis hereby authorised and required to give judgment
accordingly, and to award execution thereon ; Provided, such
sheriff or officer have ten days' previous notice of such mo-
tion.(o)
49. Where any fine or penalty is inflicted on the executors
or administrators of any sheriff, under authority of this act,
the same shall be considered to aftect only the assets in their
hands as executors or administrators.(6)
50. No sheriff or other officer shall return any execution or
attachment for not performing a decree in chancery, to the
office from whence the same issued, without noting thereon how
he hath executed the same, unless by the express directions, in
writing, of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney ; and, if anyp
sheriff or other officer, having no such directions, shall return
such execution or attachment to the office from whence the same
issued, without noting or endorsing thereon how he hath exe
cuted the same, such sheriff or other officer, and his securities,
and the executors or administrators of all and every of them,
shall, in every such case, be liable to the like fine, and recover
able in the same manner as a recovery may be had against a
sheriff failing to return an execution;* and, moreover, every
sheriff and other officer whatsoever, in returning all executions
by them levied or settled, and the monies thereon received, or
any part thereof, shall make a statement on every execution
of the amount thereof, including their own fees and commis
sions, and return the same, with the execution, to the office
from whence it issued. (c)
51. In all cases where the sheriff or other officer, taking
property under execution, shall die before he sells such pro-
perty, it shall be lawful for the clerk of the court from which
such execution issued, and he is hereby required, to issue a
venditioni exponas, directed to the sheriff or Serjeant of the
county or corporation in which the property was taken in
execution ; and the said sheriff or Serjeant shall, under the
said venditioni exponas, receive the property from the representatives
of the former sheriff or other officer, who are hereby
required to deliver such property to the said sheriff, upon his
producing to them the venditioni exponas, and executing to
them a receipt for the property ; and the said sheriff shall
proceed to sell such property in the manner prescribed by law
in other cases of venditioni exponas,(d)
53. \¥ the representatives of the deceased sheriff shall
refuse or neglect to deliver to the sheriff the property so
taken under execution by their testator or intestate, upon the
sheriff's producing the venditioni exponas ; or if, after the
expiration of three months from the death of the sheriff, col
lector or other officer, there be no executor or administrator of
the same ; he shall return the truth of the case on the said
wr;t; upon which return, the plaintiff, (or, if it be a Common-
wealth's case, the auditor,) may, at their option, have an exe
cution, by virtue of which the sheriff or other officer may seize
the property taken by the former sheriff or other officer, wherever
it may be found, and sell the same in manner prescribed by law,
under similar executions. Or the said plaintiff or auditor, as
^he case may be, may move, in the court from which the original
execution issued, against the representatives of the deceased
sheriff or other officer ; upon which motion, judgment shall be
entered up against the representatives of the deceased sheriff
or other officer, for the amount of the execution, which came to
the hands of their testator or intestate, with lawful interest,
thereon, and the costs of the said motion ; Provided always,
That the execution issuing on such judgment shall be levied
on the estate of the said deceased sheriff or other officer, in the
hands of his representatives, who shall, in all cases, have ten
days' previous notice of the time and place of making such
motion.(g)
53. The sheriff, or other officer, discharging the duties aforesaid,
shall have the same powers, receive the same fees and
commissions, and be liable to the same penalties as in other
, . r
cases.(e)
54. And, whereas it is unreasonable that sheriffs should be
obliged to go out of their counties, to give notice to creditors,
a(- wilose suit any person may be in the custody of such sheriff,
or to Pav money levied by execution ; Be it therefore enacted,
That, where any execution shall be delivered to the sheriff of
allv 0t]ler county, than that where any creditor resides, such
creditor shall name some person, in the county where the exe
cution is to be levied, to be his, her or their agent, for the par
ticular purpose of receiving the money on such execution, and
for giving to, and receiving from the sheriff, any notices which
may be necessary relating thereto ; and payments made, and
notices given to such agent, shall be as effectual as if made or
given to the creditor : And, if any creditor shall fail to appoint
such agent, no judgment shall be entered against the sheriff
non-payment of the money and tobacco mentioned in such
execution, unless a demand thereof shall have been first made
of such sheriff, in his county, by the creditor, or some other
person having a written order from him : Nor, in case of fail
ure in appointing such agent, shall the sheriff or prisoner be
obliged to give notice, previous to the discharge of such pri
soner, either for want of security for his prison fees, or upon
his taking the oath of an insolvent debtor ; but such prisoner
shall be discharged, in those cases respectively, without any
notice to be given to the creditor so faihng.(/"j
55. After obtaining a final decree, for lands, slaves, or mo- E
ney, or things of a specific nature, in any court having chan-a{
eery jurisdiction, the clerk of such court shall, upon the re-e
quest of the party obtaining such decree, issue any writ of
execution, either a fieri facias, capias ad satisfaciendum, ha
bere facias possessionem, or any judicial process which may
now issue from any court of common law, according to the e
nature of the case, for carrying the said decree into effect ; j
which writ shall issue in the name of the Commonwealth, and
bear teste, and be signed by the clerk of the court ; and all
process so issued shall be executed and returned to the clerk's
office from which the same issued, on the return days thereof,
by the officer or officers to whom the same shall be directed,
and shall have the same operation, and possess the same force,
to all intents and purposes, as similar process issued upon
j udgments at common law. The officer or officers, to whom any
such process is directed, shall be subject to the like penalties
for misconduct or neglect, and the court shall exercise, in this,
and in all cases relating to such process, the same powers, as
if the said process had issued upon a judgment obtained at
common law. But nothing herein contained shall prohibit any
party from proceeding to carry an order or decree in chancery
into execution, in any manner of which he might avail himself
before the passing of this act.(g)
56. Upon any interlocutory decree of any superior court of
chancery, which shall not be appealed from, or upon such in-
terlocutory decree as shall be appealed from and affirmed, such
process of execution shall be awarded, as, to such court, or the
judge thereof in vacation, shall seem proper.(A)
57. The marshal of each superior court of chancery, for
failure to execute and make due return of any decree for sale,
or execution, besides being liable to an action of the party ag-
grieved, for damages, shall be fined at the discretion of the
court, from which such decree or execution shall have issued,
for the use of the party injured, in any sum not exceeding five
per centum per month, to be computed from the time when
such execution or decree ought to have been returned, until
the time of entering such fine, upon the whole amount of mo
ney to be levied, or upon the value of the specific property to
be recovered or sold ; and the court imposing the fine shall
estimate the value of such property. For failure to pay any
money, which shall appear by his return to have been received
by him in virtue of any execution or decree, ' or for which he
« shall have made himself liable by his return on such execu
« tion or decree,' he shall forfeit and pay, to the person entitled
to receive such money, fifteen per centum, per annum damages
thereon, to be computed from the time when such money ought
to be paid, until the time when it shall be paid, and to be re
covered, together with the principal sum, by motion on reason
able notice, before the court from which such execution or
decree issued: Provided, That the marshal shall not be sub-
jected to damages for not paying such money to any person
residing out of his district, unless it shall previously have been
demanded of him, by such person or his attorney, or by some
other person having written authority to make such demand.(i)
' In all cases where a fine is imposed on the marshal for his
« failing to execute or return an execution or decree, or pay
* money for which he is liable as above, the securities of such
' marshal, or his or their legal representatives, shall be liable
• for the sam,e, to be recovered by motion on reasonable notice
' before the court from which such execution or decree issued.'
58. When any execution shall be levied upon the body of
a defendant by the marshal, he shall commit him to the jail of
*'ie county» ^n which such defendant may reside, if resident
within the district, and if not, then to the jail of the county
which the execution shall have been levied : Provided, hovcever>
That no execution shall be levied on the body of any de-
fendant in any other district, than that in which he resides,
unless an execution against his body shall have been previously
issued to that district, and returned non est inventus, or unless
such defendant shall have no fixed residence within the Com-
monwea'tn- At the time of committing such defendant to jail,
the marshal shall deliver to the sheriff of the county, or keeper
of the jail, a copy of the execution, under which the arrest
shall have been made, and shall take from such sheriff or keep
er, a receipt for the body of the defendant, which he shall re
turn, together with the execution, to the court from whence it
issued. It shall be the duty of such sheriff or keeper, to re-
ceive the body of such defendant, and to give a receipt therefor;
and, in failure thereof, the sheriff shall be liable to an action
for ^ne escape 0f the defendant, in which the same recovery
shall be had, as if the execution had issued from a court of
law, in due form directed to such sheriff, had been levied by
him upon the defendant, and such defendant had then been
voluntarily permitted by him to escape. When any defendant
shall have been so committed to jail by the marshal, and a re"rip*
sha11 have been so taken for his body> lle sha11 be kePt
in all respects, by the sheriff of the county, and the keeper of
the jail, and be entitled, in all things, to the same immunities
and privileges, as if the execution, under which he had been
arrested, had been directed to the sheriff of the (
had been executed by him.(/r)
59. In all other respects, executions levied by a marshal
shall be proceeded on, in the same manner, as such executions
wouy haye been procee(le(l upon> jf directed by law to a sheriff,
and levied by him ; and forthcoming bonds taken by a mar-
shal shall have the same force and effect, as forthcoming bonds
taken by a sheriff.(A-)
60. The commission allowed to marshals, upon all monies
received by them in virtue of their office, and upon all forthcoming
bonds, shall be the same with that allowed to the she- M
riffs upon similar receipts and bonds; and their fees shall bt m
regulated by the courts to which they belong, so that they shall, H
in no case, exceed three times the amount allowed to sheriffs te
for similar services.(Ar)
61. All acts or parts of acts, coming within the purview of R
this act, shall be, and are hereby repealed : Provided, always, P
That nothing in this act shall be construed to affect any rights,
remedies, fines, forfeitures, penalties or amercements, which
have accrued, been vested, or incurred, prior to the commence
ment of this act.
62. Provided, also, That all executions issued under any F
former act, shall go on to be satisfied as such former act di
rects.
63. This act shall commence and be in force from and after C
the first day of January, eighteen hundred and twenty.

An Act concerning such debtors in execution as may have had
the benefit of the prison rules for the term of one year*
[Passed February 25, 1818.]
1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That, whenever
any debtor taken or charged in execution since the first day of
May, 1807, who may have had, or hereafter may have the benefit
of the prison rules or bounds for one year, shall not have
been discharged by due course of law, or broken the condition
of his prison bounds bond, at or before the expiration of the
said year, and the sheriff or other officer, in whose custody
such prisoner may be, shall not, without delay, after the said
term of one year shall have expired, recommit such prisoner to
close jail and confinement, it shall be lawful for the court in
which the judgment was rendered, or from which the execution
issued, by virtue of which such debtor shall have been commit
ted or charged in execution, upon motion of the person or per
sons entitled to such judgment or execution, his, her or their
executors or administrators, ten days previous notice of such
motion being given, to impose, from time to time, a fine upon
such sheriff or other officer, and his securities, his, her or their
executors or administrators, not exceeding five per centum per
month, on the whole amount of the principal, interest and
costs, of such judgment, during the time for which such duty
shall be neglected by such sheriff or other officer. After the
sa'^ recomm'tment, the prison bounds bond, which had been
executed by the said debtor and his securities, shall be considered
as discharged, and not sooner.
2. Ihis act shall be in force from the first day of July next.
C. 136.
Jin act declaring the law concerning the Escape of Debtors
an(i 0iher Prisoners.
[Passed November 24, 1792.]
1. For the more effectual retaking and securing persons
w|10 escape out of prison; Beit enacted, That if any person
committed, rendered, or charged in custody, in execution or
upon mesne process, to any county or corporation prison, or to
the jail of any district, shall thence escape, it shall and may
be lawful for any justice of the peace in the county or corpora
tion where such prisoner was in custody, upon oath of such
escape before him made by the sheriff, under-sheriff, jailor, or
other credible person, to grant unto any one demanding the
gamej one or more warrants under his hand and seal, directed
to all sheriffs, mayors, Serjeants, bailiffs and constables, within
this Commonwealth, reciting the cause of such prisoner's com
mitment, and time of his order escape, and commanding them,
and every of them in their respective counties, cities, towns,
and precincts, to seize and retalce such prisoner so escaped or
going at large, and being so retaken, forthwith to convey and
commit to the prison where debtors are usually kept in the
county or corporation where such retaking shall be, there to be
kept in safe custody, until he or she be thence discharged by
due course of law ; which warrant the sheriff or other officer
is hereby required to obey, and to receive the prisoner into his
safe custody, and to give a note to the person or persons de
livering him or her, testifying his receipt of such prisoner, and
sha11 als0 make return °* the execution of such warrant to the
court of that county, corporation, or district from whence the
prisoner escaped; and if he or she was there in custody,
charged in execution, then the sheriff or other officer shall
safely keep him or her, without bail or mainprise, until he or
she shall make full payment and satisfaction to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs, creditor or creditors, in whose name such execution
was sued out, or until the judgment or judgments obtained
against him or her shall be reversed or discharged by due
course of law. And if such prisoner shall have been in custody
upon mesne process, in any action of debt, or upon the case,
the sheriff or other officer to whom he or she shall be so recom
mitted, shall, in like manner, keep such prisoner in his safe
custody, and make return of the execution of the warrant by
which he or she was retaken, to the court of that county, cor
poration, or district wherein he or she was first arrested ; and
thereupon it shall be lawful for the said court, upon the plain
tiff's or creditor's filing his declaration, to proceed and give
judgment thereon according as the truth of the case shall
appear to them, in the same manner as if the defendant had
appeared in the said court and refused to plead ; unless such
defendant shall cause special bail to be entered in the said
court, and shall immediately plead to issue; and then, upon
certificate under the hand of the clerk of the said court, that
such bail is given, delivered to the sheriff or other oificer in
whose custody such defendant then shall be, it shall be lawful
for the said sheriff or other officer, to set at large such prisoner,
and not otherwise : but, where any prisoner escaped and reta
ken upon such warrant as aforesaid, shall thereafter be charged
with treason, felony, or other crime or cause in behalf of the
Commonwealth, for which he or she ought to be tried in the dis
trict court, and shall be for such cause removed to the jail of
the district court, every such prisoner shall be charged, in the
said district jail, with all the causes wherewith he or she stood
charged in the prison from whence he or she was removed,
until he or she be thence delivered by due course of law, in
like manner as is herein before directed.(n)
2. When any person in execution, who shall have obtained
the liberty of the prison rules by giving bond and security
for the same, shall hereafter escape and go out of the same,
the sheriff or other officer of the county or corporation, where
such prisoner was in custody, shall, and he is hereby requir
ed immediately to apply to a justice of the peace for an
escape warrant to retake such prisoner according to the direc
tions of this act ; and such sheriff or other officer shall, and he is
hereby required immediately to give notice thereof to the credi
tor at whose suit he was in custody, or to his attorney or agent,
and shall assign over and deliver to such creditor, or his attor
ney, the bond by him taken for the liberty of the prison rules,
who shall be obliged to receive the same ; and thereupon it shall
and may be lawful for such creditor, or his attorney, to pursue
the method directed by this act for retaking such debtor upon
the escape warrant aforesaid ; and if he be retaken thereupon,
and committed to jail, the securities for his keeping the prison
rules shall be discharged from their bond ; or such creditor, or
his attorney, shall or may, at their election, commence and pro
secute an action or suit at law against the security or securities
named in such bond, for the recovery of his debt, notwithstand
ing he shall- have applied for and obtained an escape warrant
against his debtor, as aforesaid, if such debtor is not retaken
and committed to jail thereupon; and the sheriff or other offi
cer shall not be liable or answerable for the payment of the
debt for which such prisoner was in custody, unless the secu
rity or securities, named in the bond by him taken of such pri
soner for the liberty of the prison rules, shall afterwards be
found to have been insufficient for the payment of such debt
at the time the same was taken.(6)
3. And whereas the situation of most prisons in this Commonwealth
hath given opportunities to evil disposed persons
to break open the same, and turn out debtors and others in cus
tody, to the hindrance of justice, prejudice of creditors, and
ruin of sheriffs, who have been compelled to pay the debts
with which such prisoners stood charged : For remedy thereof,
&e it further enacted, That no judgment shall be entered
against any sheriff or other officer, in any suit brought upon
the escape of any debtor in his or their custody, unless the jury,
who sha11 trv tlle issue> sha11 expressly find that such debtor
or prisoner did escape with the consent or through the negligence
of such sheriff, (or Serjeant,) or his officer or officers, or
that such prisoner might have been retaken, and that the she
riff, (or Serjeant,) and his officers, neglected to make immediate
Pursuit ' Provided always, That, where any sheriff or other
shall have taken the body of any debtor in execution,
and shall wilfully and negligently suffer such debtor to escape,
tne person suing out such execution, his executors or adminis-
trators, shall and may have and maintain an action of debt
against such sheriff or other officer, his executors or adminis
trators, for the recovery. of all such sums of money and tobacco,
as are mentioned in the said execution, and damages for de
taining the same ; any law, custom, or usage to the contrary,
notwithstanding. If any private person have any prisoner in
his keeping arrested for suspicion of felony, treason or murder,
and the person that is so arrested escape by negligent keeping,
that he be Dr0ught to the jail, then the person, from whom
such prisoner so escaped, shall be liable to a fine on being found
guilty on an indictment in the court of that district in which
such escape was made.(c)
