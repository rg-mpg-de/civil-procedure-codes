SEC. 152. The plaintiif shall also insert in the summons a notice, in
substance as follows:

1. In an action arising on contract, for the recovery of money only,
that he will take judgment for a sum specified therein, if the defendant
fail to answer the complaint in twenty days after the service of the summons.

2. In other actions, that if the defendant shall fail to answer the complaint within twenty days after the service of the summons, the plaintiff
will apply to the Court for the relief demanded in the complaint.

SEC. 153. A copy of the complaint need not be served with the summons. In such case, the summons must state where the complaint is or

notice of appearance to be given, and, in person or by attorney, demands,
in writing, a copy of the complaint, s cifying a p ace within the State

second, of this Code, shall be issued, orat any time afterwards, the plaintiff, or a defendant, when he sets up an affirmative cause of action in his

y answer and demands substantive relief, at the time of filing his answer,

or at any time afterwards, if the same be intended to affect real estate, may
file with the Clerk of each County in which the propert is situated a notice
of the pen dency of the action, containing the names of t eparties, the object
of the action, and the descri tion of the roperty in that County affected
thereby; and if the action for the oreclosure of a mortgage, such
notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and must contain the
date of the mortgage, the parties thereto, and the time and place of recording the_same. From the time of filing only shall the pendency of
the action be constructive notice to a purchaser or incumbrancer of the
property affected thereby; and every person whose conveyance or incumrance is sixilbsequently executed or subsequently recorded shall be deemed

a subseque t purchaser or incumbrancer, and shall be bound, by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice, to the same extent as if he
were made a party to the action. For the purposes of this Section, an
action shall be deemed to be nding from the time of filing such notice:
Provided, however, That we notice shall be of no avail, unless it shall

, be followed by the first publication of the summons, or an order therefor,
. 01' by the personal service thereof on a defendant within sixty days after
‘ such filing. And the Court in which the said action was commenced may,
in its discretion, at any time after the action shall be settled, discontinued
Or abated, as is provided in Section number one hundred and fortyfour, on application of any person aggrieved, and on good cause shown,
and on such notice as shall be directed or approved by the Court,

' order the notice authorized by this Section to be cancelled of record by
the Clerk of any County in whose oflice the same may have been filed or
recorded; and such cancellation shall be made by an indorsement to that

effect on the margin of the record, which shall refer to the order, and for
which the Clerk shall be entitled to a fee of twenty-five cents.

SEC. 156. The summons may be served by the Sheriff of the County
where the defendant may be found, or by any other person not a party to
the action. The service shall be made, and the summons returned, with
proof of the service, ‘to the rson whose name is subscribed thereto, with
all reasonable diligence. he person subscribing the summons may, at
his option, by an endorsement on the summons, fix a time for the service
thereof, and the "service shall then be made accordingly.

SEC. 157. The summons shall be served by delivering a copy thereof
as follows:

1. If the suit be against a cor oration, to the president or other head
of the corporation, secretary, cas ier, treasurer, a director, or managing
agent thereof; but such service can be made in respect to a foreign corporation only when it has property within this State, or the cause of action
arose therein, or where such service shall be made within this State personally u on the president, cashier, treasurer, or secretary thereof.

2. f against a minor under the age of fourteen years, to such minor
personally, and also to his father, mother or guardian; or, if there be
none within the State, then to any person having the care and control of
such minor, or with whom he shall reside, or in whose service he shall be
employed.

3. If against a person judicially declared to be of unsound mind, or
incapable of conducting his own affairs in consequence of habitual '
drunkenness, and for whom a committee or guardian has been appointed,
to such committee or guardian and to the defendant personally.

4. In all other cases, to the defendant personally.

SEC. 158. Where the person on whom the service of the summons is to
be made cannot, after due diligence, be found within the State, and that
fact appears by affidavit to the satisfaction of the Court or a Judge
thereof‘, or of the Probate Judge of the County where the trial is to be
had, and it in like manner appears that a cause of action exists against
the defendant in respect to whom the service is to be made, or that he is a
proper party to an action relating to real property in this State, such
Court or Judge may grant an order that the service be made by the
publication of a summons in either of the following cases:

1. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, has property within
the State, or the cause of action arose therein;

2. Where the defendant, being a resident of this State, has departed
therefrom, with intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid the service of
a summons,_or keeps himself concealed therein with the like intent ;

3. Where he is not a resident of this State, but has property therein,
and the Court has jurisdiction of the subject of the action;

4. Where the subject of the action is real or personal propert in this
State, and the Defendant has or claims a lien or interest, actua or contingent, therein, or the relief demanded consists, wholly or partly, in excluding the Defendant from any interest or lien therein ;

5. Where the action is for divorce, in the cases prescribed by law.

The order must direct the publication to be made in two newspapers,
to be designated as most likely to give notice to the person to be served,
and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, not less than
once a week for six weeks. In case of publication, the Court or Judge

must also direct a copy of the summons and complaint to be forthwith
deposited in the post office, directed to the person to be served, at his
place of residence, unless it appear that such residence is neither known
to the party making the a plication, nor can with reasonable diligence
be ascertained by him. hen publication is ordered, personal service of
a copy of the summons and complaint, out of the State, is equivalent to
publication and deposit in the post oflice.

The Defendant against whom publication is ordered, or his representatives, on application and sufficient cause shown at any time before judgment, must be allowed to defend the action; and, except in an action for
divorce, the Defendant against whom publication is ordered, or his representatives, may, in like manner, upon good cause shown, he allowed to
defend after judgment, or at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be
just ; and if the defence be successful, and the judgment or any part
thereof have been collected, or otherwise enforced, such restitution may
thereupon be compelled as the Court directs; but the title to property
sold under such judgment to a purchaser in good faith shall not be
thereby affected. And in all cases where publication is made, the complaint must be first filed, and the summons, as published, must state the
time and’ place of such filing.

In actions for the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, already instituted, or hereafter to be instituted, if any party or parties having any
interest in or lien upon such mortgaged, premises are unknown to the
Plaintiff, and the residence of such party or arties cannot, with reasonable diligence, bc ascertained by him, and suc fact shall be made to appear, by affidavit, to the Court, or to a Judge thereof, where the trial is
to be had, such Court or Judge may grant an order that the summons be
served on such unknown party or parties by publishing the same for six
weeks, once in each week successively, in a news aper printed in the
County where the premises are situated, which pub ication shall be equivalent to a personal service on such unknown party .or parties.

SEC. 159. Where the action is against two or more Defendants, and

the summons is served on one or more of them, but not on all of them, 2

the Plaintiff may proceed as follows:
1. If the actlon be against Defendants jointly indebted upon contract, he may proceed a ainst the Defendant served, unless the Court
otherwise direct; and if lie recover judgment, it may be entered against
all the Defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced against the joint property of all and the separate property of the
Defendants served, and, if they are subject to arrest, against the persons
of the Defendants served; or, .

2. If the action be against Defendants severally liable, he may proceed
against the Defendants served in the same manner as if they were the
only Defendants.

3. If all the Defendants have been served, 'ud ment may be taken
against any or either of them severally, where t e laintiff would be entitled to judgment against such Defendant or Defendants, if the action
had been against them or any of them alone.

4. If the name of one or more partners shall, for any cause, have been
omitted in any action in which judgment shall have passed against the
Defendants named in the summons, and such omission shall not have

been pleaded in such action, the Plaintiff, in case the judgment therein
shall remain unsatisfied, ma by action recover of such partner separately,
upon proving his joint liabi ity, notwithstanding he may not have been
named in the original action; but the Plaintiff shall have satisfaction of
onl one judgment rendered for the same cause of action. 

SEC. 160. In the cases mentioned in Section one hundred and fiftyeight, the service of the summons shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.

SEC. 161. Proof of the service of the summons, and of the complaint
or notice, if an , accompanying the same, must be as follows:

1. If served y the Sheriff, his certificate thereof; or,

2. If by any other person, his affidavit thereof; or,

3. In case of publication, the affidavit of the printer, or his foreman,
or principal clerk, showing the same, and an afiidavit of a deposit of a

cop of the summons in the post office, as required by law, 1f the same
sha l have been de osited; or,

4. The written a ission of the Defendant. .

In case of service otherwise than by ublication, the ‘certificate, affidavit or admission must state the time an place of the service.

SEC. 162. From the time of the service of the summons in a civil action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the Court is deemed to
have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all the subsequent

proceedings. A voluntary appearance of a Defendant is equivalent to
personal service of the summons upon him.

SEC. 180. The verification must be to the effect that the same is true ,

to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those matters a

1 mining its effect, its allegations shall

stated on information and belief, and, as to those matters, he believes it
to be true; and must be by the affidavit of the party, or, if there be several parties united in interest, and pleading together, by one at least of
such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party be within the County
where the attorney resides, and capable of making the affidavit. The
affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the action or defence be founded upon a written instrument for the payment of money
only, and such instrument be in the possession of the a t or attorney,
or if all the material allegations of the leading be wit in the personal
knowledge of the agent or attorney. hen the pleading is verified by
any other person than the party, he shall set forth in the amdavit his
knowledge, or the grounds of his belief on the subject, and the reasons
why it is not made by the party. When a corporation is a party, the
verification may be made b any officer thereof; and when the State, or
any officer thereof in its be alf, is a party, the verification may he made
by an person acquainted with the facts. The verification may be omitted w en an admission of the truth of the allegation might subject the
party to prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party, as a proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading: Provided, That the verification of any pleading
in any Court of Record in this State may be omitted in all cases where
the party called upon to verify would be privileged from testifying as a
witness to the truth of any matter denied by such pleading.

SEC. 181. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall deliver to the
adverse party, within ten days after a demand therefor in writing, a copy
of the account, which, if the pleading is verified, must be verified by his
own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be
true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The Court, or a
Judge thereof, may order a “ further account,” when the one delivered
is defective ; and the Court may, in all cases, order a bill of particulars
of the claim of either party to be furnished.

SEC. 182. In the construction of a pleading for the pur ose of detere liberally construe , with a view
of substantial 'ustice between the parties.

SEC. 183. I irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading,
it may be stricken out, on motion of any person aggrieved thereby.
And when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or uncertain
that the precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the
Court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by
amendment. ’

SEC. 184. In pleading a judgment, or other determination of a Court

; or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the

facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may
be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial the
facts conferring jurisdiction.

SEC. 185. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance; but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed all
the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted, the

party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. In an action or defence founded upon an instrument for the_ payment of money only, it shall be suiiicient for a part to
give a copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due to im
thereon from the adverse party a specified sum, which he claims.

SEC. 186. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom,

state, in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing
the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter_out of which the
cause of action arose; but it shall be suflicient to state generally that the
same was published or spoken concernin the plaintiff ; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shal be bound to establish, on trial,
that it was so published or spoken.

SEC. 188. In the actions mentioned in the last Section, the defendant
may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of
damages; and, whether he prove the justification or not, he may give, in
evidence, the mitigating circumstances.

SEC. 189. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained
doing damage, an answer that the defendant, or person by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which
the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time
doing damage thereon, shall be good, without setting forth the title to
such real property.

SEC. 190. The plaintiff may unite, in the same complaint, several
causes of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all arise out of-1. The same transaction, or transactions connected with the same subject of action; or,

2. Contract, express or implied; or, p

3. Injuries with or without force, to person and property, or either ;
or
,4. Injuries to character; or,

5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for the
withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same; or,

6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages for the
withholding thereof; or,

f}. Claims against a Trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation
0 aw.

’ But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one of these classes,
and, except in actions for the foreclosure of mortgages, must affect all
the parties to the action, and not require different places of trial, and must
be. separately stated. In actions to foreclose mortgages, the Court shall
have power to adjudge and direct the payment, by the mortgagor, of any
residue of the mortgage debt that may remain. unsatisfied after a sale of
the mortgaged premises, in cases in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the debt secured by such mortgage; and if the mortgage
debt be secured by the covenant or obligation of any person other than
the mort gor, the plaintiff may make such person a arty to the action,
and the ‘ urt may adjudge payment of the residue 0 such debt remaining unsatisfied alter a sale of the mortgaged premises against such other
person, and may enforce such 'udgment as in other cases.

SEC. 191. Every material legation of the complaint, not controverted
by the answer, as rescribed in Section one hundred and seventy-two, and
every material a legation of new matter in the answer, constituting a
counter claim, not controverted by the reply, as prescribed in Section
one hundred and seventy-six, shall, for purposes of the action, be taken
as true. But the allegation of new matter 1n the answer, not relatingto
a counter claim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted
by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case
may require.

SEC. 192. No variance between the alle tion in a pleading and the
proof shall be deemed material, unless it ave actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defence, upon
the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and in what
respect he has been misled; and thereupon the Court may order the
pleading to be amended, upon such terms as shall be just.

SEC. 193. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last Section, the Court may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence, or ma order an immediate amendment without costs.

SEC. 194. here, however, the allegation of the cause of action or
defence to which the proof is directed is not proved, not in some particular
or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be
deemed a case of variance, within the last two Sections, but a failure of

roof.
SEC. 195. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course,
without costs, and without prejudice to the roceedings already had, at
any time within twenty days after it is serve , or at any time before the
period for answering it expires; or it can be so amended at any time
within twenty days after the service of the answer or demurrer to such
pleading, unless it be made to appear to the Court that it was done for

the purposes of delay, and the plaintiff or defendant will thereby lose the
benefit of a circuit or term for which the cause is or may be noticed; and
if it appear to the Court that such amendment was made for such purpose, the same may be stricken out, and such terms imposed as to the
Court may seem just. In such case a copy of the amended pleading
must be served on the adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer,
either at a general or special term, the Court may, in- its discretion, if it
appear that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the party to
plead over upon such terms as may be just. If the demurrer be allowed
for the cause mentioned in the fifth sub-division of Section one hundred
and sixty-seven, the Court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as
may be just, order the action to be divided into as many actions as may
be necessary to the proper determination of the causes of action therein
mentioned.

SEC. 196. The Court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance of
justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process
or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party; or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; or by inserting other allegations material to the case; or, when
the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defence, by
conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved.

SEC. 197. The Court may likewise, in its discretion, and upon such

that no answer has been received. The Clerk shall thereupon enter judgment for the amount mentioned in the summons, a ainst the defendant,
or defendants, or against one or more of several de endants, in the cases
provided for in Section one hundred and fifty-nine. But if the complaint be
not sworn to, and such action is on an instrument for the payment of money
only, the Clerk, on its production to him, shall assess the amount due to
the plaintiff thereon; and in other cases shall ascertain the amount which
the plaintiff is entitled to recover in such action, from his examination,

into effect, the Court may takegthe account or hear the proof, or may, in
its discretion, order a reference for that purpose. And where the action
is for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property,
with damages for the withholding thereof, the Court may order the
damages to be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long account
be involved, by a reference as above provided. If the defendant give notice of appearance in the action before the expiration of the time for
answering, he shall be entitled to eight days’ notice of the time and place
of ap lication to the Court for the relief demanded by the complaint.

the plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath resfpectin g any payments
that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any one or his use, on account
of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is

abide the order of the Court, touching the restitution of any estate or
effects which may be directed by such judgment to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money that may be collected under or by

su ported wholly or rtly by his labor.

SEC. 324. The Judge may also, by order, appoint a receiver of the
property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner, and with the like

such receiver, the Judge shall ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of
the party or otherwise, whether any other supplementary proceedings

SEC. 325. If it appear that a person or cor oration alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in
the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or debt shall
be recoverable onl in an action against such person or corporation by the
receiver; but the fudge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest, till a suflicient opportunity be given
to the receiver to commence the action, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution; but such order may be modified or dissolved by the
Judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he shall direct.

SEC. 826. The Judge may, In his discretion, order a reference to a

the Trial Justice, the Court may determine the alleged error in fact on
aflidavits, and may, in its discretion, inquire into and determine the same

case, as pleadings in actions in the Circuit Court, and the Court may
thereupon re uire the op osite party to answer such amended pleading,
or 'oin issue t ereon, as t e case may require, summarily.

. If, upon an appeal in an issue of law, the Court should adjudge the
pleading complained of to be valid, it shall, in like manner, require the
opposite party summarily to answer such pleading, or join issue thereon,
as the case may require.

3. Upon an issue of fact being so joined, the Court shall proceed to
hear the same trial by a jury in the same manner as issues joined in the
Circuit Court. '

cases where a new trial may be had, as in this chapter provided; and in
any such appeal on which a new trial is to be had, either party may, at
any time be ore the trial, serve upon the opposite party an offer, in writing,
to allow judgment to be taken against him for the sum or property, or to
the effect in such offer specified, and with or without costs, as said offer
shall specify. If the party receiving such offer accept the same, and give
notice therwf in writing within ten days, he may file the return and offer,

a jud ent more favorable to him than that specified in said offer, then
he sha 1 not recover costs, but must pay the other party’s costs from the
date of the service of the offer.

6. Either party may move for a new trial in said Court on a case or
exception, or otherwise, and such motion may be made before or after
judgment has been entered; and the provisions of this Act in re1ation’to
the proceedings on receiving the verdict of a jury, exceptions to the decisions of the Court, making and settling cases and exceptions, ‘motions for
new‘ trials, and making up the judgment-roll in the Circuit Court, are

hereby made applicable to all appeals brought up for trial, as in this chapter provided.

the other, and render judgment for the balance. 1

rendered on appeal, in all cases, with the following exceptions and limitations: In the notice of appeal, the appellant shall state in what particular
or particulars he claims the judgment should have been more favorable to

than it should have been, he shall state what should have been its amount.
Within fifteen days after the service of the notice of appeal, the respondent ma serve upon the appellant and Trial Justice an offer, in writing, to a low the judgment to be corrected in any of the particulars mentioned in the notice of appeal. The ap ellant may thereupon, and within
five days thereafter, file with the Trial ustice a written acceptance of such
offer, who shall thereupon make a minute thereof in his docket, and correct
such judgment accordingly, and the same, so corrected, shall stand as his
judgment, and be enforced accordingly ; and any execution which has been
issued upon the judgment appealed from shall be amended by the Trial Justice to correspond with the amended judgment; and no undertakin given to
stay execution shall be enforced for more than the amount 0 the corrected judgment. If such offer be not made, and the judgment in the
Appellate Court be more favorable to the appellant than the judgment in
the Court below, or if such offer be made and not accepted, and the judgment in the Appellate Court be more favorable to the appellant than the
offer of the respondent, the a pellant shall recover costs : Provided, however, That the appellant sha 1 not recover costs unless the judgment a
pealed from shall be reversed on such ap 1, or be made more favorab e

and when the judgment in the suit before the Court below was against
such appellant, he shall further be allowed to tax the costs incurred by
him which he would have been entitled to recover in case the judgment
below has been rendered in his favor. If, upon an appeal, a recovery for
any debt or damages be had by one party, and costs be awarded to the
other party, the Court shall set off such costs against such debt or damages, and render judgment for the balance. The following fees and costs,
