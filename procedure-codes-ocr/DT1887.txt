ants, if the action had been against them, 01-- any of them alone. 
4. If the name of one or more partners shall, for any cause, 
have been omitted in any action i11 which judgment shall have­ 
passed against the defendants named in the summons, and such
omission shall not have been pleaded in such action, the plaintiff,

§ 4921. Every pleading in a court of record must be subscribed by a party or his attorney; and when any pleading is 
verified, every subsequent pleading, except a demurr .. er, must be 
'fl d l 
ver1 e. a so. · 
§ 4922. The ver .. ifications must be to the effect that the
same is true to the kuowledge of the person making it, except 
as to those matters stated upon information and belief, and as to
those matters he believes it to be true, except where it is made 
by any person other than a party to the action, in which case it
must be to the effect that tho same is true 1-,0 'the best knowledge, 
information and belief of the person making it; and such verifi-
cation must be by the affidavit of party, or if th e1·e be several 
parties united in interest and pleading together, by 011e at least
of such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party be within
the county where the attor .. ney resides and capable of makirrg
the affidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or
attorney if the party is absent from the county i11 which such 
attorney resicles, or is not a resident thereof'; and when tho pleacl- 
ing is verified by any other person than the party he shall set
forth in the affidavit the reasons why it is not inade by the party. 
When a corporation is a par .. ty the verification may be made by 
any officer thereof; and when the territor·y 01" any officer thereof
i11 its behalf is, a party, the verification may be made by any per .. - 
son acquainted with the facts. T.he verification may be omitted
when a11 admission of the truth of the allegation might subject 
the party to prosecution for f elony, and no pleading can be use cl
in a criminal prosecution against the party as proof of a fact ad­ 
mitted or alleged i11 such pleading. 
§ 4923. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth i11 
a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall 
deliver to the ad verse party, within ten clays after the clemand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading 
is verified, must be verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent 01 .. 
attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true, or be pre-
eluded from giving evidence ther .. eof. The court, or a judge
thereof, may order a "further account," when the one deliverecl
is defective; and the court may i11 all cases order a bill of par- 
ticulars of' the claim of either party to be furnished. 
§ 4924. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegation shall be liberally construed, 
with a view of substantial justice between the parties. . 
§ 1925. If irrelevant. or redundant matte:r be inserted 111 a,
plead111g, it may be stricken out, on mot1011 of any person 
aggrjeved thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading are
so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge 
or defense is not apparent, the -court n1ay 1--equire tl1e plea;cli11g, to
be macle clefinite and c.ertai11 by amendme11t. 
§ 4926. In pleadi11g a judg1-:r1ent, or otl1er deter1ni11atiori of
a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it sl1all 11ot be 11ecessary 
- 
to state. the facts couferr ing jurisdiction, but such judgment· or
determination may be stated to have been duly g.iven or made. 
If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to ·establisl1, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction. 
§  4927. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent 
 · h 11 b t th f h · 
IP a contract; it S a not e necessary O state e acts S owing 
such performance; but it may be stated generally that the party
tions be controverted, the party plea ing shall be bound to 
establish, 011 the trial, the facts showing such performance, · In 
an action or defense founded upon an instrument for the pay­
ment of money 011ly, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a 
copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due to him 
thereon from the ad verse varty a specified sum which he claims.
§ 4928. I11 pleading a private statute, or a right derived 
therefrom, it shall be suffi.cient to refer to such statute, by its title and the clay of its passage, and the court shall thereupon 
take judicial notice ther .. eof. 
§ 4929. In a11 action for libel or slancler, it shall not be 
necessary to state i11 the complaint any intr .. insic facts, for the 
purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defama- 
i.or .. Y matter .. out of which the cause of action arose, but it shall
be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or 
spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allegation be con­
troverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that 
it was so published or spoken. 
§ 4930. In the actions mentioned i11 the last section, the
aefendant may, i;n his answer, allege both the truth of the mat- 
ter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances, to
reduce the amount of <damages; ancl whether he prove the justi­

five clays' notice of the time and place of such assessment.
Where the defendant, by his answer i11 any such action, shall not
deny the plaintiff's claim, but shall set up a counter-claim,
amounting to less than the plaintiff's claim, judgment may be 
had by the plaintiff for the excess of said claim over the saicl coun ..

demand mentioned in the complaint; and if the defendant be not 
a resident of the terr itory, must require the plaintiff 01 .. his agent
to be examinecl 011 oath respecting any payments that have been

inafter provided. An execution may issue against a married
woman, and it must direct the levy and collection of the amount
of the judgment against her from her separate property, and not
otherwise. 
§ 5115. If the action be one in which the defendant might
have been arrested as provided i11 section 4945 and section 4947,

tion of the court, or a judge thereof, that any judgment debtor,
residing in the district where such judge resicles, h~s pr~perty 
which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of
the judgment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the
judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place, to

upon be had for the application of the property of the judgment
debtor towards the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided 
upon a return of an execution. 
3. On an examination under this section, either party may 
examine witnesses in his behalf, and the judgment debtor may be
examined i11. the same manner as a witness,

ment debtor, the judge may, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise
to his satisfaction, that there is danger of the debtor leaving the
territory, 01-- concealing himself', ancl that there is reason to
believe he has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to 
such judgment, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff -of any
county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him

him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution. Nor shall he be
excusecl from answering any question on the ground that l1e has, 
before the examination, executed any conveyance, assignment
or transfer of his property for any purpose, but his answer shall 
not be used as evidence against him in any er .. iminal proceeding
or prosecution. . 
§ 5175. After the issuing of execution against propert_y,

selves.
§ 5370. Whenever from any cause it is, in the opinion of 
the court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to make a com­
plete partition, i11 the first instance, among all the parties i1
inter .. est, the court may first ascer .. tain and determine the shares or
interest respectively helcl by the 01 .. iginal co-tenants.and thereupon
adjudge and cause a partition to be made, as if such original
co-tenants were the parties and sole parties, in interest, and the
only parties to the action, and thereafter may proceed i11 like
manner to acljudge and make partition separately of each share 
or portion so ascertained or allotted as between those claiming
under the original tenant to whom the same shall have been so
set apart, or may allow them to remain tenants i11 common 
thereof, as they may desire. 
§ 5371. If it appear to the court by the certificate of the 
register of deeds, or clerk of the district court, or by the sworn
or verified statement of any person who may have examined 01"

brances of record upon such real property, or any part or portion
thereof, which existed and were of record at the time of the com­ 
mencement of the action, and the persons holcling such liens 
are not made parties to the action, the court must either order
such persons to be made parties to the action by a11 amendment 
or supplemental complai nt, or appoint a l"eferee to ascertain
whetl1er 01" not such liens or incumbrances have been paid, or,
if not paicl, what amount remains due thereon, ancl their .. order 
among the liens 01· incumbrances severally held by such persons

place, to make proof, by his own affidavit or otherwise, of the
amount due or to become due contingently or absolutely thereon.
In case such person be absent, or his residence be unknown, serv­
ice may be made by publication or notice to his agent, under
the direction of the court, in such manner as may be proper.
The report of the ref eree thereon must be made to the court, and
must be confirmed, modified, or set aside, and a new reference
ordered, as the justice of the case rriay require. 
§ 5373. If it be alleged in the complaint and established by
evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation 
i11 the complaint, to the satisfaction of the court, that the prop·
erty or any part of it, is so situated that .partition cannot be
made without great prejudice to the owners, the court may
order a sale thereof. Otherwise upon the requisite proof being 
made, it must order .. a partition accor .. ding to the respective rights
of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint thr .. ee
referees therefor'; and must designate the portion to remain
undivided for the owners whose interests remain unknown, or 
are not ascertained.
§ 5374. In making the partition, referees must divide the 
property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective
parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to 
the respective rights of the parties as determined by the court,
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, designating the sev­ 
eral portions by proper landmarks, and may employ a surveyor
with the necessary assistants to aid them. Before making parti­
tion or sale, the referees may, whenever it will be for the 
advantage of those interested, set apart a portion of the property
for a way, road or street, and the portion so set apart shall not 
be assigned to any of the parties, or sold, but · shall remain an
open and public way, road or street, unless the referees shall set 
the same apart as a private way for the use of the parties inter­
ested, or some of them, their heirs or assigns, in w hich case it 
shall remain such private way. 
§ 5375. The referees must make a report of their proceed­ 
ings, specifying therein the 1na1111e1-- in which they executed their
trust, and describing the property divided, and the share allotted 
to each party, with a particular description of each sh?'re.
§ 5376. The court may confirm, change, modify, or set 
asi e, the report, and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon
the report being confirmed, judgment must be rendered t~a~ 
such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is binding 
ancl conclusive: .

-stipulate and agree that the service of any leg·al process against
him as such executor, administrator or guardian if made 011 said 
. agent shall be of the same legal effect as if made 011 himself
personally within the territory. Such writing shall give the
-prope1 .. address of such agent and shall be filed in the office of 
.the judge of the probate court where such appointment is made. 
§ 5726. Every person to whom letters testamentary or of
.:administration are directed to issue, must, before receiving them,
-ezecute a bond to the territory of Dakota, with two or more suffi­ 
clent sureties, to be approved by the judge of the probate court.
In form the bond must be joint and several, and the penalty
must not be less than twice the value of the personal property, 
~nd twice the probable value of _t11e annual rents, profits and 
:J.SSu,es of the real property belonging to the estate, which values 
111t1Rt be ascertained by the probate judge, by examining on oath
the party applying, and a11y other persons. · · · 
§ 5727. The judge must require an additional bond when­
ever the sale of any real estate belonging .. to an estate is ordered!
by him; but 110 such additional bond must be required when it. 
satisfactorily appears to the court that the penalty of the bond 
given befoi .. e receiving letters, or any bond given in place thereof
is equal to twice the value of the personal property remaining in,.
or that will come into the possession of the executor or adminis­ 
trator, including the annual rents, profits, and issues of real
estate still belong ing to the estate, and twice the probable 
amount to be realized 011 the sale of the real estate ordered to be

one thousand dollars, and there are more· than. two sureties­ 
thereon, they may state in their afficla vits that they are· severally .
worth amounts less than that expressed in the bond, if the whole 
amount be equivalent to that of two sufficient sureties, and the·
affidavits thereof must be- attached to, and filed' and recorded with. 
the bond. All such bonds must be approved by the judge of the
probate court before being filed and 1 .. ecorded, Before the judge-

vit that the sureties or some 011.e or more of them are not worth 
as much as they have justified to, issue a· citation, 1 .. equiring such.
sureties to appear before him, at a designated. time and place, to, 
be examined touching their property and its 'value; and the­ 
judge must, at the same time, issue a notice to the executor
or administrator, requiring his appearance on the return of th,e·

additional security. . 
§ 5732. If sufficient security be not given within the ~1f!!e· 
fixed by the judge's ~rder,. the right of such executor or admims­
trator to the administr .. ation shall cease, and the person next

other cases.

·petition, represent to the juclge of the probate CO~l"t that the 
sureties of the executor or administrator thereof have become
or are becoming insolvent or that they have removed or ar~ 
about to r:e~ove from this territory, or that £1 .. om any other cause
the bond is 111s~1ffic1e~1t, and ask t~1at further security be required. 
§ 5735· If the judge 18 satisfied that the matter requires
Investig'ation, a c1tat1011 must be issued to the executor· or admin-

the judge may order. 
§  5736. On the return of the cite.tion, or at such other time 
. as the judge may appoint, he must p1 .. oceed to hear the proofs
and allegations of the parties. If it satisfactorily appears that

order requiring the executor or admin istrator to give further 
security, or to file a new boud, in the usual form, within a rea­
sonable time, not less than five days.

utor or administrator be required to give further secur .. ity, or· to

trator is wasting the property of the estate, the judge may, by
order, suspend his powers until the matter can be heard and 
determined. 
§ 5739. When it comes to his knowledge that the bond of
any executor or administrator .. is, from any cause, insufficient, 
the judge of the probate court, without any applicatio11, must cite
him to appear and show cause why he should not give further 
security, and must proceed thereon as upon the application of 
any person interested.

desires to be released from responsibility 011 account of future
aets, he rnay make application by petition to the judge of the 
probate court for relief. The judge must issue a citation to the

the territory, or cannot be found after due diligence and inquiry,
service may be made as provided when the citation is to 1"equire 
turther security.

§ 5763. Every executor or administrator must make and 
.iretur11 to the court, at its first term after .. his appointment a true
inventory and appraisement of all the estate of the de~edent, 
except the homestead, if any, which has come to his possession 
or knowledge. 
CHAPTER 4. 
§ 5764. To make the appraisernent, the judge must appoint
'three clisinterested persons, any [two] of w ... horn may act, who 
are entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their serv­
·ices, not to exceed two dollars per day, to be allowed by the 
court, · The .. appraisers must, with the inventory, file a verified
account of their services and disbursements. If any part of the 
$t_ate is in any other county, the same appraisers may proceecl
to view and appraise the same, or other appraisers i11 that county 
may t,e appointed, to per .. form that duty, by the judge of the pro­
bate court of the county in which the· letters were issued, as he 
may deem best, and the like report must be made in each case
direct to the probate court of the county which issued the letters. 
§ 5765. Before proceeding to the execution of their duty, 
the appraisers must take and subscribe an oath, to be attached 
to the inventory, that they will truly, honestly, and impartially
appraise the property exhibited to them, according to the best
of their knowledge and ability. They must then proceed to esti­
mate and appraise the property; each article must be set down
separately, with the value thereof in dollars and cents, in figures, 
opposite to the articles respectively; the i~1.ventory must contain 
all the estate of the decedent, real a11c1 personal, except the
homestead, a statement of all debts, partnerships arid other inter­ 
~sts, bonds, mortgages, notes and other securities for· the pay­
ment of money belonging to the decedent, specifying· the name 
of the debtor in each security, the date; the sum originally pay­
able, the indorsements thereon, if any, with their dates, and the 
eum which, in the judgment of the appraiser .. s, may be collected
on each debt, interest or security. . 
§ 5766. The inventory must also contain an account of all
mon~ys belonging to the decedent, which have come to the hands
,of the executor or administrator, and if none, the fact must be so 
:state:d in the inventory. If the whole estate consists of money,
there need not be an appraisement, but' an inventory must be 
made and returned as i11 other cases. 
~ - 
§ 5767. The naming of a person as executor does not thereby 
dischar:ge him from any just claim which the testator has against 
him, but the claim · must be included i11 the inventory, and the 
executor is liable for the same, as for so much money in his· 
hands, when the debt or demand becomes due. 
§ 5768. The discharge 01' bequest. in a will of ariy debt or·
demand of the testator against the executor named,' or any other
person, is not valid against the creditors of the decedent, but is a. 
specific bequest of the debt or demand. It must be included i11. 
the inventory, and, if necessary, applied in the payment of the·
debts. If not necessary for that purpose, it must be paid in the· 
same manner and proportion as other specific legacies. 
§ 5769. The inventory must be signed by t.he appraisers, and
the executor or administrator must take and subscribe an oath, 
befor .. e an officer author .. ized to administer oaths, that the inven­
tory contains a true statement of all the estate of the decedent. 
which has come to his knowledge and possession, ·and particularly·
of all money belonging .. to the decedent, and of all just claims of·
the decedent against the affiant, The oath must be indorsed. 
upon or annexed to the inventory.
§ 5770. If a11 executor 01" administrator neglects or refuses: 
to return the inventory within the time prescribed, or within such
further time, not exceeding two months, which the judg .. e shall, 
for a reasonable cause, allow, the court may, upon notice, revoke­
the letters testamentary 01" of administration, and the executor­ 
or admiuistrator is liable 011 his bond for any injur .. y to the estate.,
or any person inter .. ested therein, arising fr .. om such failure. 
§ 5771. Whenever property not mentioned in an inventory
that is made and filed, comes to the possession or knowledge of 
an executor or administrator, he must cause the same to be 
 
appraised in the manner p1 .. escribed i11 this article, and a11 i11- 
ventory thereof to be returned within two months after the dis­
covery; and the making of such inventory may be enforced, 
after notice, by attachment or removal from office.
§ 5772. The executor or adrninistr .. ator is entitled to the 
possession of all the real and personal estate of the decedent, and 
to 1 .. eceive the rents and profits of the real estate, except the
realty and improvements thereon properly belonging to the 
homestead, and such per .. sonal property as is reser .. ved by law t?­ 
the widow and children of the decedent, or either of them, until
the estate is settled or until delivered over by order of the p1"0- 
bate court to the heir .. s or devisees; and must keep in good tonant­
able repair all houses, buildings, and fixtur .. es thereon, which ar .. e 
under his control. The heirs or devisees may themselves, or 
jointly with the executor or administrator, maintain an action
for .. the possession of the real estate, or for the purpose of qu1e~11Jg­ title to the same, against any one except the executor .. or adminis­
trator. 
§ 5773. Unless it satisfactorily appears to the probate court
that the rents, issues and profits of the real estate for a lo1:1g.er
periocl are necessary to be received by the executor or ad~n111~s­ 
trator wherewith to pay the debts of the decedent. or that it wilt
probably be necessary to sell the 1 .. eal estate for .. the p3:y1n~nt of 
such debts at the end of ten mouths fr .. 01n 'the fi rst pt1bl1cat1011 of

.sented as required by this code. 
§ 5791. Every claim which is due when pr .. esented to the 
.administrator must be supported by the affidavit of the claimant 
-or som.e one i11 his behalf, that the amount is justly due, that 110
payments have been made thereon which are not credited, and

-contingent, the particulars of such claim must be stated. When
the affidavit is made by a person other than the claimant, he 
must set forth i11 the affidavit the reason why it is riot made by
·the claimant. The executor or administrator may also require 
-satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be produced i11 support of

sented to him, such 1 .. efusal or neglect is equivalent to a rejection 
on the tenth day; and if the presentation be made by a notary, 
the certificate of such notary, under seal, is p1 .. ima facie evidence,
of such presentation and rejection, If the claim be presented to 
the executor 01 .. administrator" befor .. e the expiration of the time­
limited for the presentation of claims, the same is presented in 
time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator, arid

original instrument must be exhibited if demanded, unless it is 
lost or destroyed, i11 which case the claimant must accompany
his claim by his affidavit, containing a copy OP particular descrip­ 
tion of $UCh instrument, and stating its loss or destruction. If

Iien w hich has been recorded 01" filed according to law i11 the·
office of the register of deeds of the county i11 which the land 
affected by it lies, it is sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien,
and refer to the date of its filing and volume, and page of its.
record. If, i11 any case, the claimant has left any original 
voucher i11 the hands of the executor or administrator, 01' suffered,
the same to be filed in court, he may withdraw the same when 
a copy of the same has been already, or is then, attached to his.

others, 011 oath, and hear any other legal evidence touching the 
validity of the claim. 
§ 5798. No holder of any claim against an estate shall

.accept the amount allowed in satisfaction of his claim he shall
recover no costs in an action therefor, brought against the exe- 
cutor or administrator, unless he recovers a greater amount than 
'that offered to be allowed.
§ 5802. A judgment rendered against an executor or admin­ 
istrator, in the district court or before a magistrate, upon any
-claim for money against the estate of his testator or intestate, 
-only establishes the claim i11 the same manner as if it had been
.allowed by the executor. or administrator, and the judge of the 
probate court, and the judgment must be that the executor or
administrator pay, i11 due course of administr .. ation, the amount 
.ascertained to be due, A certified transcr .. ipt of the judgment
must be filed in the probate court, No execution must issue upon 
.sucn judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property of
the estate, or give to the judgment creditor any priority of pay­ 
ment. 
§ 5803. When any judgment has been rendered for or against
-the testator or intestate i11 his life-time, no execution shall issue 
thereon after his death, except: 
1. In case of the death of the judgment creditor, upon the
.application of his executor or administrator, or successor in 
interests. 1 
2. In case of the death of the judgment debtor, if the judg­
ment be for the recovery of real or personal property, or the 
-enforcement of a lien thereon. 
A judgment against the decedent for the recovery of money,
must be presented to the executor or administrator, like any. 
other claim. If the execution is actually levied upon any prop­
-erty of the decedent before his death, the same may be sold for 
the satisfaction thereof, and the officer making the sale must
account to the executor or administrator for any surplus in his 
hands. 
§ 5804. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying 
.after verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment 
is rendered thereon, is not a lien 011 the real property of the
-decedent, but is payable in due course of administration. 
§ 5805. If the executor or administrator doubts the correct-
ness of any claim presented to him, he may enter into an. agree ... 
ment, in writing, with the claimant, to refer the matter 111 con-
·troversy to some disinterested person, to be approved by the 
.judge of the probate court. Upon :filing the agreement, and
.approval of the judge of the probate court? in. the office .o~ the 
clerk of the distr .. ict court for the county or judicial subdivision 
in which the letters testamentary or of administration were
granted, the clerk must, either in vacation or in term, enter a
minute of the order referr ing the matter in controversy to the
person so selectecl; or, if the parties consent, a reference ~ay be 
had in the probate court; and the .1 .. eport of the referee, if con­
firmed, establishes or rejects the claim, the same as if it had been
allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator and the pro- 
·bate judge. 
§ 5806. The referee must hear and deterrnirie the matter, 
and make his repor·t thereon to the court in which his appoint­
ment is entered, The same proceedings shall be had in all
respects, and the referee shall have the same powers, be entitled_
to the same compensation, a11~ subject to tl1e same control as in
other cases of ref erence, 'I'he court may remove the referee
appoint another in his place, set aside or confirm his report, and_
adjudge costs, as in actions against executors or administrators, 
and the juclgment of the court thereon shall be as valid and
effectual, in all respects, as if the same had been rendered in a. 
suit commenced by ordinary process. 
§ 5807. When a judgment is recovered, with costs, against.
any executor or administrator, he .shall be individually liable for 
such costs, but they must be allowed him in his administration
accounts, unless it appears that the suit or proceeding in which.
the costs were taxed was prosecuted or defended without just 
cause. 
§ 5808. If the executor or administrator is a creditor of the­ 
decedent, his claim, duly authenticated by affidavits, must be
presented for allowance or rejection to the judge of the· probate­ 
court; and its allowance by the judge is sufficient evidence of its.
correctness, and it must be paid as other claims, in due courseof
administration, If, however, the judge rejects theclaim, action
thereon may be had against the estate by the claimant, and sum­ 
mons must be served 'upon the judge of the probate court, who­
may appoint an attorney at the expense of the estate, to defend.
the action. If the claimant recover no judgment, he must pay
all costs, including defendant's attorney's fee. 
§ 5809. If a11 executor or administrator neglect for two­
months after his appointment to give notice to creditors, as pre­ 
scr·ibecl by this chapter, the court must revoke h is letters, and.
appoint some other person in his stead, equally or next in order, 
entitlecl to the appointment, . 
§ 5810. At the same term at which he is required to return
his inventory, the executor or administrator must also return a. 
statement of all claims against the estate which have been
presented to him, if so required by the court; and from term to­ 
to term thereafter he must present a statemen t of claims subse- ·
quently presented to him, I~ all such statements he m:1-st 
designate the names of tho creditors, the nature of each claim, 
when it became due or will become due, and whether it was . 
allowed or rejected by him. 
§ 5811. If there be any debt of the decedent bearmg mterest,
whether presented 01" not, the executor or administrator may, 
by order of the probate court, pay tho amount the11 accumulated,
and unpaid, or any part thereof, at any time wh en there ~re·

may direct, in the manner hereinafter prescribed. There shall 
be no priority as between personal and real property for tho above
purposes. 
§ 5813. No sale of any property of an estate of a decedent
is valid unles made under order of the probate court, except
as otherwise hereinafter provided. All sales must be reported
under oath, and confirmed by the probate court, before the title 
to the property sold passes. 
§ 5814. All petitio11s for orders of sale must be i11 writing,
setting forth the facts showing· the sale to be necessary, and upon 
the hearing, any per·son interested in the estate may file his writ­
ten objections, which must be hear .. d and deter .. mined, A failure
to set forth the facts showing the sale to be necessary will not
invalidate the subsequent proceedings, if the defect be supplied
by the proofs at the hearing, and the general facts showing the 
necessity be stated i11 the order directing the sale. 
§ 5815. When it appears to the court that the estate is 
insolvent, or that it will require a sale of all the property of the 
estate, of every character, chargeable therewith, to pay tho
family allowance, expenses of administration, and debts, there 
need be but 011e petition filed, but 011e order of sale made, and
but 011e sale hacl, except i11 cases of perishable property, which
may be sold as provided in the next section. 'I'he probate court,
when a petition for the sale of any property, for any of the pur­ 
poses her·ein named, is presented, must inquire fully i11 to the
probable amount requir·ed to rnake all such payments, and if
there be no more estate chargeable therewith than sufficient to
pay the same, may require but one proceeding for the sale of the
entire available estate. 111 such case the petition must set forth 
all the facts required by section 5822. .

§ 5816. At any time after receiving letters, the executor, 
administrator, or special administrator may apply to the judge
and obtain an order to sell perishable and other personal pro1)­
erty likely to depreciate in value, or which will incur loss 01"
expense by being kept, and so TUUCh other personal property a~ 
may be necessary to pay the allowance made to the f amily of
the decedent. The order for the sale may be made without
notice; but the executor, administrator or special administrator
is responsible for the property, unless, after making a sworn 
return, and on a proper showing, the court shall approve the
sale. 
01
§ 5817. If claims against the estate have been allowed, and
a sale of property is necessary for their payment, or the expenses
of administration, or for the payment of legacies, the executor
or administrator may apply for an order to sell so much of the
personal property as may be necessary therefor. Upon filing
his petition, notice of at least five days must be given of the 
hearing of the application, either by posting notices or by adver­
tising. He may also make a similar application, either in vaca­
tion or term, from time to time, so long as any personal property
remains in his hands, and sale thereof is necessary. If it appear
for the best interest of the estate, he may, at any time after
filing the inventories, in like manner, and after giving like
notice, apply for and obtain an order to sell the whole of the 
personal property belonging to the estate, remaining and not set
apart, whether necessary to pay debts or not. 
§ 5818. Partnership interests, or interests belonging to any
estate by virtue of any partnership formerly existing, interest in 
personal property pledged, and choses in action, may be sold in
the same manner as other personal property, when it appears to
be for the best interest of the estate. Before confirming the sale
of any partnership interest, whether made to the surviving part­ 
ner or to any other person, the judge must carefully inquire into
the condition of the partnership affairs, .and must examine the 
surviving partner, if in the county and able to be present in
court. 
§ 5819. If it appear that a sale is necessary for the pay­
ment of debts or the family allowance, or for the best interest 
of the estate, and the persons. interested in the property to be
sold, whether it is or is not necessary to pay the debts or family
allowance, the court or judge must order it to be made. In 
making orders and sales for the payment of debts or family
allowance, euch articles as are not necessary for the support and 
subsistence of the family of the decedent, or are not specially
bequeathed, must be first sold, and the court or judge must so
direct. 
§ 5820. The sale of personal property must be made at pub­
lic auction, and after public notice given for at least fifteen days, 
by notices posted in three public places in the county, or by pub­
lication i11 a newspaper, or both, containing the time and place 
of sale, and a brief description of the property to be sold; unless
for good reasons shown, the court or Judge orders a private sale, 
or a shorter notice. Public sales of such property must be made
at the court house door, or at the residence of the decedent, or at 
some other public place, but no sale shall be made of any personal
property which is not present at the time of sale, unless the court 
or judge otherwise order.

g1·a11ted to the executor 01· administrator to sell so much of the 
real estate of the decedent as is necessary, 
§ 5824. A copy of the order to show cause must be per­ 
sonally served on all persons interested i11 the estate, any general, 
guardian of a minor so interested, and any legatee or devisee, or 
heir of the decedent, provided they are residents of the countv 
at least ten days before the time appointed for hearing the peti:
tion, or be published four successive weeks in such newspaper or 
the county as the court or judge shall direct. If all persons in­ 
terested in the estate j oin i11 the petition for the sale, or signify
in writing their assent thereto, the notice may be disnensed with, 
and the hearing may be had at any time. - 
§ 5825. The probate court, at the time and place appointed
in such order, or at such other time to which the hearing may 
be postponed, upon satisfactory proof of personal service or pub­
Iication of a copy of the order, by affidavit or otherwise if the- 
consent i11 wri ti ng to such sale of all par .. ties interested is not, 
filed, must proceed to hear the petition, a11d hear and examine­ 
the allegations and proof of tl1e petitioners, and of per .. sons inter­
ested in the estate who may oppose the application. All claims.
against the decedent not before presented, if the period of pre­ 
sentation has not elapsed, may be presented and passed upon at, 
the hearing. · 
§ 5826. The executor, administrator, and witnesses may be­ 
examined on oath by either party, and process to compel them, 
to attencl and testify may be issued by the judge of the probate
court in the same manner and with like effect as in other cases .

and that by a sale thereof the residue of the estate, real or per­ 
sonal, or some specific par .. t thereof, would be greatly injured or
diminished i11. value, or subjected to expense, or rendered unprofit­ 
able, or that after such sale the residue would be so small i1:11 
quantity 01" value, or would be of such a character with reference­ 
to its future disposition among the heirs or clevisees, as clearly
to render it for the best interests of all concerned that the same


estate, or of any part thereof necessary and for the best interest. 
of all concerned.

§ 5829. The order of. sale must describe the lands to be sold'.,
and the terms of sale, wh ich may be for cash, or II?ay be for .. 011e-

most beneficial to the estate, unless the court otherwise special Y 
directs, If it appears tha~ any part of. such. real estate has bee!lf·

debts or legacies, ~lie court must order tho remainder to be sote 
befor .. e that so devised. Every such sale must be ordered to 't; 
made at public auction. unless, i11 the opinion of the cour.t, 1 ' 
would benefit the estate to sell the whole OI'. some p~rt °i d.£~~ 
real estate at pri vate sale; the court may if the same is as e 
in the petition, order or direct such real estate. or any part tl1ereof
to be sold at either .Public or private sale, , as the executor 
administrator shall J~14ge to be most beneficial for the estate. If
the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale 
under the orcler and as directed therein, he may be compelled. to
sell, by order of the court, made on motion, after due notice by 
any party interested, '
§ 5830. If the executor ?l, administrator neglects to apply 
for any order of sale when it is necessary, any person may make
application therefor in the same 1na1111er as the executor or 
administrator, and notice thereof, must be given to the executor
or administratorvbefore the hearing. The petition of such appli­ 
cant, must co11ta111 as ma11:y- of the matters required for the peti­
tion of the executor or administrator as he can ascertain and the
decree of sale must fix the period of time within which tl1e exec­ 
utor or administrator must make the sale. 
§ 5831. When a sale is ordered, and is to be made at public
auction, notice of the time and place of sale must be posted in
three of the most public places i11 the county i11 which the land
is situated, and published in a newspaper if there be one printecl 
in the same county, but if none, t11e11 i11 such paper as the court 
may direct, for three weeks successively next before the sale. The
lands and tenements to be sold must be described with common 
certainty i11 the notice. 
§ 5832. Sales at public auction must be made i11 the county
where the land is situated; but when the land -is situated i11 two 
or more counties, it may be sold i11 either. The sale must be
made between the hours of nine o'clock in the morning and the 
setting of the sun on the same day, and must be made on the
day named in the notice of sale, unless the same is postponed. 
§ 5833. Whe11 a sale of real estate is ordered to be made at
private sale, notice of the same must be posted up in three of the
most public places in the county in which the land is situated, 
and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed i11 the
same county; if none, then i11 such paper as the court may 
direct, for two weeks successively next before the day 011 or
after which the sale is to be made, in which the lands and tene­ 
ments to be solcl must be clescribecl with common certainty, .The
notice must state a day on or after which the sale will be made, 
and a place where offers or bids will be received. 'I'ho day last
referred to must be at least fifteeen days from the first publica­
tion of notice, and the sale must not be made before that day,
but mast be made within six months thereafter. The bids or 
offers must be in writing, and may be left at the place designated
in the notice, or delivered to the executor or administrator per­ 
sonally, or may be filed in the office of the judge of the probate
court, to which the return of sale must be made, at any time
after the first publication of notice, and before the making of 
the sale. If it is shown that it will be for the best interest of
the estate, the court or judge may, by an order, shorten the time
of notice, which shall not, however, be less than one week, and 
may provide that the sale may be made on or after a day less
t~aia fifteen, but not less than eight days from the first publica­ 
tion of the :notice, in which case the notice of sale and the sale 
may be made to correspond with such order. 
§ 5834. No sale of real estate at private sale shall be con­ 
firmed by the court unless the sum offered is at least ninety per 
eeat. of the appraised value ther .. eof, nor unless such real estate 
0; 
has been appraised within one year of the time of such sale. If
it has not been so appraisecl, or if the court is satisfied that the
appraisement is too high 01' too low, appraisers must be appointed 
and they must make an appraisement thereof in the same man:
ner as i11 case of an original appraisement of an estate. This 
may be done at any time before the sale or the confirmation
thereof. 
§ 5835. The executor or administrator must, when the sale
is made 11pon a credit, take the notes of the purchaser for the
purchase money with a mortgage on the property to secure their
payment. 
§ 5836. The executor or administrator, after making any
sale of real estate, must .make a return of his proceedings to the 
probate court, which must be filed by the judge, at anv time sub­
sequent to the sale, either in term or vacation. If the sale be
macle at public auction, and the return is made and filed on or
before the first day of the next term thereafter, no notice is
requirecl of such return or of the hearing· thereof, but the bearing
may be hacl upon the first day of the term, or any subsequent
day to which the same may be postponed, If the sale be not 
made at public auction, or if made at public auction a hearing
upon the return of proceedings be asked for in the return, 01' is
brought on for a hearing upon a day before the first day of the 
next term ther .. eafter, or 11pon any other day than the first day of
the next term after such sale, the court or judge 'must fix the day
for the hearing, of which notice of at least ten days must be
given by the judge, by notices posted i11 three public places in 
the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both, as he may
deem best, and must briefly indicate the land sold, the sum for
which it was sold, and must refer to the return for further par­ 
ticulars. Upon the hearing the court must examine the return
and witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings 
were unfair, or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and if 
it appear that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per cent.,
exclusive of the expenses of a new sale, may be obtained, the 
court may vacate the sale and direct another to be had, of which
notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted as if 
no previous sale had taken place; if an offer ten per cent. m0!e 
in amount than that named in the return be made to the court in
writing, by a responsible person, it is in the discretion of the 
court to accept such offer and confirm the sale to such person or
to order a new sale. 
§ 5837. When return of the sale is made and filed, any p@r-
son interested in the estate may file written objections to the 
confirmation thereof, and may be heard thereon when. the return
is heard by the court or judge, and may produce witnesses in 
support of his objections. ' 
§ 5838. If it appear to the court that the sale was legtl~
made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was not 
proportionate to the value of the proper'ty sold, and that .a g·reat:x
sum, as above specified, cannot be obtained, or if the 1ncreas ·t 
bid mentioned in section 5836 be made and accepted ~y the co~I '
the court must makean order confirming the sale, an?- d1r.ec~~~~ 
conveyances to be executed. The sale, from that tun.fl,
1~ 
firmed and valid, and a certified copy of the order con rrr:;:J' in 
and directing conveyances to be executed must b~ reco~ch the
the office of the register of deeds of the county within whichaser 
land sold is situated. If after the confirmation the pur 
8 
tr it 
 
neglects or refuses to comply with the terms of sale the court 
may, on motion of the executor or administrator, and a'fter notice 
to the purchaser, order a resale to be made of the pr .. operty. If 
the amount realized on such resale does not cover · the bid and
the expenses of the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the 
deficiency to the estate. 
§ 5839. Conveyances must ther .. eupon be executed to the
purchaser by the executor or administrator, and they must refer
to the orders of the probate court authorizing and confirming the 
sale of the property of the estate, and directing conveyances
thereof to be executed, and to the record of the order of confirm .. 
ation in the office of the register of deeds, by the date, volume
and page of the record, and such reference shall have the same 
effect as if the orders were at large inserted in the conveyance.
Conveyances so made convey all the right, title, interest and
estate of the decedent, in the premises, at the time of his death;
if, prior to the sale, by operation of law 01~ otherwise, the
estate has acquired any right, title or interest in the premises, 
other than, or in addition to, that of the decedent at the time of
his death, such right, title or interest also passes by such convey­ 
ance. 
§ 5840. Before any order is entered confirming the sale, it
must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that notice was 
given of the sale as prescribed, and the order of confirmation
must show that such proof was made. 
§ 5841. If, at the time appointed for the sale, the executor 
or administrator deems it for the interest of the persons con­
cerned therein that the same be postponed, he may postpone it 
from time to time, not exceeding in all three months. 
§ 5842. In case of a postponement, notice thereof must be 
given, by a public declaration, at the time and place first
appointed for the sale, and if the postponement be for more than 
one day, further notice must be given by posting notices in three 
or more public places in the county where the land is situated,
or publishing the same, or both, as the time and circumstances 
will admit. 
§ 5843. If the testator makes provisions by his will or desig­
nates the estate to be appropriated for the payment of his debts, 
the expenses of administration, or family expenses, they must
be paid according to such provisions or designation, out of the 
estate thus appropriated, so far as the same is sufficient. 
§ 5844. When property is directed by the will to be sold, or
authority is given in the will to sell property, the executor may
sell any property of the estate without the "order of the nrobate 
court, and at either public or private sale, and with or without
notice, as the executor may determine; but the executor must
make return of such sales as in other cases; and if directions are
given in the will as to the mode of selling, or the particular 
property to be sold, such directions must be observed. I11 either
c·ase no title passes unless the sale is con.firmed by the court. 
§ 5845. If the provision made by the will, or the estate ap­
propriated therefor, is insufficient to pay the debts, expenses of 
aidm.inis_tration, and family exp_ens~s, that portion of the e?tate 
Dot devised or disposed of by will, if any, must be appropriated
and disposed of for that purpose according to the p1 .. ovisions of 
·this article. 
§ 5845. The estate, real and personal, given by wil_l .to
legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of adminis- 
tration, and family expenses, in proportion to the value or
amount of the several clevises or legacies, but specific devises or 
legacies are exempt from such Iiabi lity if it appears to the court 
necessary to carr .. y into effect the intention of the testator, and
there is other· sufficient estate. 
§ 5847. When an estate given by will has been sold for the 
payment of debts or expenses, a.1.1 the devisees and legatees 
must contribute according· to their respective interests to the 
devises 01~ leg·atee whose devise or leg·acy has been taken ther·e­
for, and the probate court, when distribution is made, must, 'by 
clecree for that purpose, settle the amount of the several liabili­
ties, and decree the amount each person shall contribute and 
reserve the same from their distributive shares respectively, for 
t lie pur .. po e of paying such contribution. 
§ 5848. If a decedent, at the time of his death, was pos­
sessed of a contract for the purchase of land, his interests in such 
laud and under such contracts may be sold on the application
of his executor or administrator, in the same manner as if he had 
died seized of such lancl, and the same proceedings may be had
for that purpose as are prescribed in this chapter for the sale' of 
lands of which he died seized, except as hereinafter provided. 
§ 5849. The sale must be made subject to all payments that 
may hereafter become due on such contracts, and if there are
any such the sale must not be confirmed by the probate court un­
til the purchaser's execute a bond to the executor· or administra­ 
tor, for the benefit and indemnity of himself and of the persons
entitled to the interest of the decedent in the lands so contracted 
for, in double the whole amount of payments thereafter to be­
come due on such contract, with such sureties as the probate 
judge shall approve. 
§ 5850. The bond must be conditioned that the purchaser­ 
,, r: ill make a.11 payments for such land that become due after the 
date of the sale, and will fully Indemnify the executor' or admin­ 
istrator and the per .. sons so entitled against all demands, costs, 
charges and expenses by reason of any covenant or agreement
contained in such contract. · 
§ 5851. Upon the confirmation of the sale, the executor or
administrator must execute to the purchaser an asaig nment of 
the contract, which vests in the purchaser, his heirs and assigns,

§ 5871. When a person who is bound by contract in writing
to convey any real estate, dies. before making the conveyance, 
and in all cases when such decedent, if living, might be com- 
pelled to make such conveya.nce, the probate court may make a
decree authorizing and directing his executor or administrator 
to convey such real estate to the person 'entitled thereto. 
§ 5872. On the presentation of a verified petition by any
person claiming to be entitled to such conveyance from an 
executor or administrator, setting forth the facts upon which the
claim is pr .. edicated, the probate judge must appoint a time and
place for hearing the petition, at a regular term of court, and
must order notice thereof to be published at least four successive 
weeks before such hearing, in such newspaper in this territory
as he may designate. · 
§ 5873. At a time and place appointed for the hearing, or
at such other time to which the same may be postponed, upon
satisfactory proof, by affidavit or otherwise, of the due publica ..
tion of the notice, the court must proceed to a hearing, and all
persons interested in the estate may appear and contest such 
petition, by filing their objections in writing, and the court may
examine, on oath, the petitioner and all who may be produced
before him for that purpose . 
§ 5874. If, after a full hearing upon the petition and objec-
examination of the facts and circumstances of the 
claim, the court is satisfied that the petitioner is entitled to a
conveyance of the real estate described in the petition, a decree 
authorizing and directing the executor or administrator to
execute a conveyance thereof to the petitioner must be made, 
entered on the minutes of the court, and recorded.
§ 5875. The exe.cutor or administrator must execute the 
conveyance according to the directions of the decree, a certified
copy of which must be recorded with the deed in the office of the
register of deeds of the county where the lands lie, and is prima 
facie evidence of the correctness of the proceedings and of the
authority of the executor or administrator to make the convey­ 
ance. 
§ 5876. If, upon hearing i11 the probate court, as herein­
before provided, the right of the petitioner to have a specific
performance of the contract is found to be doubtful, the court 
must dismiss the petition without prejudice to the rights of the
petitioner, who may, at any time within six months thereafter, 
proceed in the clistrict court to enforce a specific performance
thereof, 
§ 5877. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a decree 
of the probate court, as provided in this chapter, shall pass ~ 1e title to the estate contracted for as fully as if the contracting
party himself was still living and executed the conveyance. 
§ 5878. A copy of the decree for a conveyance, made by 
the probate court, and duly certified and recorded i11. _tl1e office of
the register of deeds of the county w!1ere the lands lie, _gives the 
person entitled to the conveyance a right to the p_ossess1on of the
lands contracted for, and to hold the same according to the terms 
of the conveyance, i11 like manner as if they had been conveyed
in pu1~sua11ce of the decree. . . . 
§ 5879. The recording of any decree; as provided 111 the
preceding section, shall not prevent the court making the decree 
from enf orcing the same by other process. . 
§ 5880. If the person entitled to the co11veya~ce. die before

thereof by the court, or upon appeal, is conclusive against all per
sons i11 any way interested i11 the estate, saving, however, to all per .. 
son laboring under any leg·al disability, their right to move for-­
cause to reopen and examine the account, OI"' to proceed by 
action against the executor or administrator, either individually­
or upon his boud, at any time before final distribution; and in 
any action brought by any such person, the allowance and settle .. - 
ment of such account is prima facie evidence of its correctness.
§ 5905. The account must not be allowed by the court until 
it is first proved that notice has been given as 1 .. equired by this chapter, a11d the decree must show that such proof was made to­ 
the satisfaction of the court, and is conclusive evidence of the­
fact. 
§ 5906. Whenever it appears to the court 011 any hear .. ingof
a11 application £01" the sale of real property, that it would be for 
the interest of the estate that personal property of the estate, 01~ 
some part of such property, should be first sold, the court may

the sale thereof shall be conducted i11 the same manner as 1£ the

mortgage 011ly extends to the pr .. oceeds of the p1 .. oper .. ty mort- 
gaged, If the proceeds of such property be insufficient to pay
the mortgage, the part remaining unsatisfied must be classed 
with other demands against the estate.
§ 5910. If the estate be insufficient to pay all the debts of 
any one class, each creditor must be paid a dividend i11 propor­
tion to his claim: and no creditor of any class shall receive any 
payment until all those of the preceding class are fully paid. 
§ 5911. The executor or administrator, as soon as he has
sufficient funds i11 his hands, must pay the funeral expenses, and 
the expenses of the last sickness, and the allowance made to the
family of the decedent. He may retain in his hands the neces­ 
sary expenses of administration, but he is not obliged to pay
any other debt or any legacy until, as prescribed in this article, 
the payment has been ordered by the court.
§ 5912. Upon the settlement of the accounts of the executor 
or administrator, at the end of the year, as required in this chapter, the court must make a11 order for the payment of the
debts, as the circumstances of the estate require. If there be not
sufficient funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, the
court must.specify in the decree· the sum to be paid to each cred-
itor. If the whole assets of the estate be exhausted by such
payment or distribution, such account must be considered as a
final account, and the executor or administrator is entitled to his
discharge on producing and filing the necessary vouchers and
proofs, showing that such payments have been made, and that he 
has fully complied with the decree of the court.
§ 5913. If there is any claim not due, or any contingent 
or disputed claim against the estate, the amount thereof, or such
part of the same as the holder would be entitled to if the claim
were due, established or absolute, must be paid into the court,
and there remain, to be paid over to the party when he becomes 
entitled thereto; or, if 11 e fails to establish his claim, to be paid
over or distributed as the circumstances of the estate require, 
If any creditor whose claim has been allowed, but is not yet clue,
appears and assents to a deduction therefrom of the legal interest
for the time the claim has yet to run, he is entitled to be paid
accordi11gly. The payments provicled for i11 this section are not
to be made when the estate is insolvent, unless a pro rata clis­ 
tribution is ordered.
§ 5914. Whe11 a decree is made by the probate court for the 
payment of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally 
\ . 
liable to each creditor for his allowed claim, or the dividend
thereon, ancl execution may be issued on such decrees, as upon
judgment in the district court, in favor of each creditor, and the
same proceeding may be had under such execution as if it had
been issued from the district court. The executor or administra­
tor is liable therefor, on his bond, to each creditor . 
§ 5915. When the accounts of the administrator or executor
have been settled, and an order made for the payment of debts
and distribution of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not
included in the order for payment, has any right to call upon the
creditors who have been paid, 01-- upon the heirs, devisees, or
legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim;· but if the 
executor 01 .. administrator has failed to give the notice to creditors
as required in the first ancl second sections of chapter 6, such
creditor may recover on the bond of the executor or administra­
tor the amount of his clairn, or such part thereof as he would
have been entitled to had it been allowed. This section shall not 
apply to any creditor whose claim was not due ten months before
the day of settlement, or whose claim was contingent and did
not become absolute ten months before such day. 
§ 5916. If the whole of the debts have been paid by the first
clistribution, the court must direct the payment of legacies 
and the distribution of the estate among the heirs, legatees, or
other persons entitled as provided in the next chapter; but if 
there be debts remaining unpaid, or, if, for other reasons, the
estate be not in a proper condition to be closed, the court must
give such extension of time as may be reasonable for a final set­ 
tlement of the estate. 
§ 5917. At the time designated in the last section, or sooner,
if within that time all the property of the estate has been sold, 
or there are sufficient funds in his hands for the pay merit of all
debts due by the estate, and the estate be in a proper condition to 
be closed, the executor or administrator must render a final
account, and pray a settlement of his administration. 
§ 5918. If he neglect to render his account, the same pro­
ceecling·s may be had" as prescribed in this chapter in regard to 
the first account to be rendered by him; and all the provisions of
this chapter relative to the last mentioned account, and the notice 
and settlement thereof, apply to his account presented for final
settlement.

§ 5920. Notice of the application must be given to the
-executor or adrniriistrator, personally, and to all persons inter. 
-ested m the estate, in the same manner .. that notice is required to
be given of the settlement of the account of an executor or 
.administrator, 
§ 5921. The executor or administrator, or any person inter­
-ested in the estate, may appear at the time named and resist the 
application, or any other heir, devisee 01" legatee may make a 
-similar application for himself, 
§ 5922. If at the hearing it appears that the estate is but
·little indebted, and that the share of the party applying may be 
allowed to him without loss to the creditors of the estate the
court must make an order in conformity with the prayer of the 
.applicant, requiring: 
1. Each heir, legatee or devisee obtaining such order, before
receiving his share or any portion thereof, to execute and cleliver
to the executor or administrator a bond, in SL1ch sum as shall be 
-designated by the probate judge, with sureties to be approved by
'the judge, payable to the executor or administrator, ancl condi­
·tioned for the payment, w henever required, of his proportion of
'the debts due from the estate, not exceeding the value or amount
-of the legacy or portion of the estate to which he is entitled. 
2. The executor or administrator to deliver to the heir, lega­
iee or devisee the whole portion of the estate to which he may 
be entitled, or only a part thereof, designating it.
If, in the execution of the order, a partition is necessary be­ 
tween two or more of the parties interested, it must be made i11
'the manner hereinafter prescribed. The costs of these proceed­ 
ings to b(e paid by the applicant, or if there be more than one, to
:be apportioned equally amongst them. 
§ 5923. When any bond has been executed and delivered,
under the provisions of the preceding section, and it is necessary
'for the settlement of the estate to require the payment of any
'part of the money thereby secured, the executor or administrator
must petition the court for an order requiring the payment, and 
have a citation issued and served on the party bound, requiring
him to appear and show cause why the order should not be made.
At the heating, the court, if satisfied of the necessity of such pay- 
'ment, must make an order accordingly, designating the amount
-and.giving a time within which it must be paid. If the m~ney 
be not paid within the time allowed, an action may be maintained 
'by the executor or administrator on the bond.

judge may order .. notice of the settlement of such supplementary·
account, and refer the same as in other cases of the settlement of

§ 5925. In the order or decree, the court must name the· 
persons and the proportions 01 .. parts to which each shall be entitled, and such persons may demand, sue for and recover their­
respective shares from the executor or administrator, or any
person having the same in possession. Such order or decree is 
conclusive as to the rights of heir .. s, legatees or devisees. subject
011ly to be reversed, set aside, or modified 011 appeal. , 
§ 5926. Upon application for distribution, after final set­
tlement of the accounts of administration, if the decedent was a: .. 
11011-resident of t his territory, leaving a willwhich has been duly
proved or allowed in the state, territory or district of his resi­
dence, and a11 authenticated copy thereof has been admitted to­ 
probate in this territory, ancl it is necessary, in order that the
estate or any part thereof may be distributed according to the-­ 
will, that the estate in this territory should be delivered to the ex­
ecutor or administrator in the state or place of his residence, the, 
court may order such delivery to be made, and, if necessary,
order a sale of the real estate, and a like deli very of the pro­ 
ceeds. The delivery, in accordance with the order of the court, 
is a full discharge of the executor or administrator with the will'
annexed in this territory, i11 1 .. elation to all· property embraced in 
such order, which, unless reversed on appeal, binds and con­
cludes all parties in interest. Sales of real estate ordered by 
virtue of this section must be made in the same manner as other
sales of real estate of decedents by 01 .. der of the probate court. · 
§ 5927. The order or decree may be made on the petition of
the executor or administrator, or of any person interested in the­ 
estate. Notice of the application must be given by posting 01· 
publication, as the court may direct, and for such t~111.e a.s 1n~y

decree of distribution ~o ~wo 01-- more heirs, clevisees 01' legatees,
is in common and undivided, ancl t~1~ respective shares are 
separated and distinguished, partition 01" dietr'ibu tion may be
made by three disinterested persons, to be appointed commis­ 
sioners for that pl1rpos~ by theprobato court ~r Judge, who must
be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of tl1e1r duties. A certi­ 
fied copy of the order of their appointment, and of the order or
decree assigning and distributing the estate, must be issued to
them as their warrant, and their oath must be indorsed thereon,
Upon consent of the parties, or when the court deems it proper 
and just, it is sufficient to appoint one commissioner only, who
has the same authority, and is governed by the same rules as if 
three were appointed. 
§ 5930. Such partition may be orclered and had i11 the pro­
bate court, 011 the petition of any person interested. But before 
commissioners ar~ appointed, ~1' _partiti~n ordered by the probate
court as directed in this subdi vision, notice thereof must be given 
to all persons interested, who reside in this territory, 01-- their
guardians, and to the agents, attorneys, or guardians, if any in
this territory, of such as reside out of the territory, either per .. 
sonally 01'" by public notice, as the probate court may direct.
The petition may be filed, attorneys, guardians and agents ap­ 
pointed and notice gi ven, at any time before the order or decree
of distribution, but the commissioners must not be appointed 
until the order or decree is made distributing the estate.
§ 5931. If the real estate is i11 different counties, the pro­ 
bate court may, if deemed proper, appoint commissioners for all,
or differ .. ent commissioners for each county. The whole estate,
whether i11 one or more counties, shall be divided among the 
heirs, devisees, or 'legatees as if it were all in 011e county, and
the commissioners must, unless otherwise directed by the p1"0·
bate court, make division of such real estate, wherever situated 
within this territory. · 
§ 5932. Partition or distribution -of the real estate may be
made as provided in this chapter, although some of the 01 .. iginal
heirs, legatees, or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other 
.persons, and such shares must be assigned to the person holding 
the same, in the same manner as they otherwise would have
been to such heirs, legatees, or devisecs. 
§ 5933. When both distribution and partition are made,
the several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out
to each individual in proportion to his right, by metes and
bounds, or description, so that the same can be easily distin ..
guished, unless two or more of the parties interested consent to 
have their shares set out so as to be held by them in common
and undi vided. · 
§ 5934. When the real estate cannot be divided without
prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the probate court may 
assign the whole to one or more of the parties entitled to shares
therei11, who will accept it, always preferring the males to the
feinales, and among children pref erring the elder to the younger.
fhe parties accepting the whole must pay to the other parties 
ln.terested their just proportion of the true value thereof, or se­
cure the same to their satisfaction; or, i11 case of the minority of 
saeh party .. then to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true
value of the estate must be ascertained and reported by the com­ 
missioners. When the commissioners appointed to make par- 
110t 
tition are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be divided 
without prejudice or inconvenience to the owner·s, they must so 
report to court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as 
herein provided, and must find and report the true value of such
real estate. On filing the report of the commissioners, and on
making 01" securing the payment as before provided, the court
if it appears just and proper, must confirm the report and there: 
upon the assignment is complete, and the title to the whole of
such real estate vests in the person to whom the same is so 
assigned, 
§ 5935. Whe11 any tract of Jand or tenement is of greater
value than any 011e's share in the estate to be divided, and cannot 
be divided without injury to the same, it may be set off by the 
commissioners appointed to make IJa1 .. tition to any of the parties
who will accept it, giving preference as prescribed in the preced .. 
111g section. 'I'he party accepting must pay or secure to the 
others such sums as the commissioners shall a ward to make the 
partition equal, and the commissioners must make their award
accordingly; but such partition must not be established by the 
cour .. t until the sums a warded are paicl to the parties entitled to 
the same, or secured to their satisfaction, 
§ 5936. Whe11 it appears to the court, from the commis ..
sioners' report, that it cannot be otherwise fair .. ly divided, and 
should be sold, the court may order the sale of the whole or any
part of the estate, real or personal, by the executor or adminis .. 
trator, or by a commission appointed for that purpose, and the
proceecls distributed. 'I'he sale must be conducted, reported and 
confirmed in tho same manner and under the same requirements 
as provided i11 article 3, chapter 7 of this code. 
§ 5937. Before any partition is made, or any estate divided,
as providecl i11 this chapter, notice must be given to all persons
interested i11 the partition, their guardians, agents or attorneys, 
by the commissioners, of the time and place when and where
they shall proceed to make partition. The commissioners may 
take testimony, 01--de1" surveys, and take such other steps as may 
be necessary to enable thorn to form a judgment upon the mat·
ters before them. 
§ 5938. The commissioners must report their proceedi11g:s,
and the par .. tition agreed upon by them, to the pr .. obate court, in 
writing, and the court may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the 
report and commit the same to the same commissioners, or 
appoint others; and when such report is finally conflrmed, a 
certified copy of the judgment 01'" decree of partition made 
thereon, attestecl by the judge, under the se!l,l of the court, must
be recorded i11 the office of tl.1e register of deeds of the county 
where the lancls lie. ~ 
§ 5939. When the probate court makes a judgment or
decree assigning the residue of any estate to 011:e or mo1"~ p~rso1:s 
entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint comm1ss1?11eis
to make partition or distribution thereof, unless the part1esh t1

such partition be made. ~ d

out of and having no agent 111 this territory, ancl it is necessary
that some person should be authorized to take possession and

court may appoint an agent for that purpose, and authorize him
to take charge of such estate as well as to act for such absent 
person i11 the distribution, 
§ 5942. The agent must first give a bond to the probate
judge, to be approved by him, conditioned that he shall faithfully
manage and account for the estate. 'I'he court appointing such 
agent may allow a reasonable sum out of the profits of the estate
for his services and expenses, 
§ 5943. When personal property remains in the hands of
the agent unclaimed for a year, and it appears to the court that 
it is for the benefit of those interested, it shall be sold under the
order of the court, and the proceeds, after deducting .. the expenses
of the sale allowed by the court, must be paid into the territorial 
treasury. Whe11 the payment is made, the agent must take from
the treasury duplicate receipts, 011e of which he must file in the
office of the territorial auditor, and the other in the probate court. 
§ 5944. The agent must render to the probate court appoint­

4. Expenses incurred in the care, protection and management
thereof, and whether paid or unpaid . 
Whe11 filed, the probate court may examine witnesses and take
proofs in regard to the account; and if satisfied from such
accounts and proofs that it will be for the benefit and advantage
of the persons interested therein, the court may, by order, direct
a sale to be made of the whole or such parts of the real or per­
sonal property as shall appear to be prOJ)er, and the purchase 
money to be deposited in the territorial treasury, to be receipted
for and the receipts filed as in like cases before provided. 
§ 5945. The agent is liable 011 his bond for the care and
preservation of the estate while in his hands, and for the pay­ 
ment of the proceeds of the sale, as required i11 the preceding sections, and may be sued thereon by any person interested, 
§ 5946. When any person appears and .cl~ims the .mo~ey
paid into the treasury, the probate court making, the distribution 
must inquire into such claim, ancl, being first satisfied of his

minutes of the court, the preservation of tl1e estate requires that
such letters should issue. But the letters so issued do not confer

or to pay or satisfy legacies or to distribute the. property of the 
decedent among the next of kin, until the final determination of
the appeal.

tions of law alone, or desiring a review therein, upon the evi­ 
deuce appearing on the trial below, either of questions of fact or
law, he must, within ten days from the rendition of juds:ment, 
J:>repare a statement of· the case and file the same with ~be
justice. The statement must contain the grounds upon which 
the party intends to rely 011 the appeal, and so much of the·
evidence as may be necessary to explain the grounds, and no- 
more .. Within ten days after· he receives notice that the state­
ment is filecl, the adverse party, if dissatisfied with the same, 
may file amendments, The proposed statement and amend­
ments ml1st. be settled by the justice, and if 110 amendments be

that court. 
§ 6132. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, and 011 pay­
ment of ?ne dollar for the return of the justice, and filing an 
undertaking as required m the next section, and after settle­
merit or adoption of statement, if any, the justice must within

questions of fact or both law and fact, and a new trial in the 
district c~urt be demanded in the notice of appeal, a certified 
copy of his docket, the pleadings, all notices, motions and other
papers filed in the cause, the notice of appeal and the undertaking 
filed; in. all other cases a certified copy of his docket, tho state­
ment as admitted or as settled, the notice of appeal and the

§ 6133. An appeal from a justice's court is not effectual for 
any purpose, unless an undertaking be filed, with two or more
sureties, in the sum of one hundred dollars, for the payment of
the costs on the appeal; or, if a stay of proceedings be rlaimed, 
in a sum equal to twice the amount of the judgment, i.icluding 
costs, when the judgment is for the payment of money· or twice
the value of the property, including costs, when the judgment is
for the recovery of specific personal property, and must be con­
ditioned, when the action is for the recovery of money, that the
appellant will pay the amount of the judgment appealed from
and all costs, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or the 
amount of any judgment and all costs that may be recovered
against him. in the action in the clistrict court. When the action 
is for the recover·y of' specific per·sonal property the undertal{ing 
must be conditioned that the appellant will pay the judgment
and costs appealed from, and obey the order of the court made 
therein, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, _or a1:iy judg­
ment ·and costs that may be recovered against him m said action
in the district court, and will obey any order made by the court
therein. A deposit of the ~mount of the judgment, including all 
costs appealed from, or of the value of the property, including
al! costs in actions for the recovery of specific personal property, 
with the Justice is equivalent to the f1l111g of the undertaking',
and in such ca~es the justice must transmit the money to the
clerk of the district court, to be by him paid out on the or·der of 
the court. The adverse party may except to the sufficiency of 
the sureties within five days after the filing of the under­
taking, and unless they or other sureties justify before the 
justice before whom the appeal is taken, within five days there­
after, upon notice to the adverse party, to the amounts stated in
their affidavits, the appeal must be regarded as if no such under­
taking l1ad been given, 
§ 6134. In Judgments for the delivery of possession in
actions of forcible entry and detainer, or detainer only, the exe­
cution of the same can not be stayed unless a written undertaking
be executed on the part of the appellant, with two or mote sureties,
to ·the effect that during the possession of such property by the
appellant he will not commit or suffer to be committed any waste
thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed, or the appeal be
dismissed, he will pay all rents for the use and occupation of the
property, and all damages from the time of the appeal until the
clelivery of the possession thereof. 
§ 6135. If an execution be issued, on the filing of the under­
taking staying proceedings, the justice must, by order, direct 
the officer to stay all proceedings on tl1e same. Such officer
must, upon payment of his fees for services rendered on the exe­
cution, thereupon relinquish all pr·operty levied upon, and deliver
the same p the ~udg1nent debtor, together with all moneys col­
le:ted from .iales or otherwise. If his fees be not paid, the officer 
may retain · much of the property or proceeds thereof as may
be necessary to pay the same. 
§ 6136. Upon an appeal heard upon a statement of the case,
the district, court may review all orders affecting the judgment 
appealed from, and may set aside, affirm or modify the judg­
ment, or any or all the proceedings subsequent. to and dependent
upon such judgment, and may, if necessary or proper, order a
new trial. When the action is tried anew, upon appeal, the
trial must be conducted in all respects as trials in the district 
court. The provisions of the code of civil procedure as to chang­
ing tho place of trial, and all the provisions as to trials in the 
district court, are applicable to trials on appeal in that court.
For a failure to prosecute an appeal, or unnecessary delay in 
bringing it to a hearing, the district court, after notice, may
orclor the appeal to be dismissed. J udgments rendered in the 
district court on appeal, have the same force and effect, and
may be enforced in the district court in the same manner, as 
juclgments in actions commenced therein, except that when a
new trial is granted the case must be remanded, and the new
nrial chall be had in the justice's court. No noti~e of. trial and 
note of issue shall be required to be. served or filed 111. or~er.to
brine the cause appealed upon the trial calendar in the district 
court, but said appeal shall be filed by the clerk, on payment of
his costs, and entered upon the calendar, and shall stand for 
trial as soon as the same is reached in the regular call of the cal· 
endar thereafter. If not so filed within :fifteen days from t~e
time such appeal was perfected, then the same sha.ll be dis­ 
missed by the order of the court at a°;y t1~e thereafter, upon
motion of the appellee, after three days notice to the appellant 
.or his attorney. 

 
§ 6137. .Justices of the peace may issue i11 any action or
proceedings 111 the courts held by them, any original mesne or 
final process to any part of the county. '
§ 6138. Tl1e su~mo!1s, execution and every other paper 
made or issued by a Justice, except a subpcena, must be issued 
without a blank left to Le filled by another, otherwise it is voicl. 
§ 6139. Justices of the peace must receive from the sheriff
or constables of their county, all moneys collected 011 any pro­ 
cess or orcler issued from their courts respectively, and all
moneys paid to them _in tl1ej_1" official capacity, ancl must pay the 
same over to the parties entitled or authorized to receive them, 
without delay.
§ 6140. In case of the sickness or other disability, or nee­ 
essary absence of a justice, 011 a return of a summons, 01'" at the
time appointed for a trial, another justice of the same township 
or county, may, at his request, attend i11 his behalf', and there­ 
upon is vested with the power, for the time being, of the justice 
before whom the summons was returnable. In that case the 
proper entry of the proceedings before the attending justice, sub­ 
scribed by him, must be made i11 the docket of the Justice before
whom the summons was returnable. If the case is adjourned, 
the justice before whom the summo11s was returnable, may re­ 
sume jurisdiction. 
§ 6141. The justice shall i11 all cases where plaintiff is a 
non-resident of the territory, or foreign corporation, before is­ 
suing a summons, requir·e of the plaintiff sufficient sur·ety for
costs. The surety must be a residen t of the county. His obli­ 
gation shall be complete by simply indorsing the summons, 01· 
signing his name on the complaint, as security for· costs. 111 all 
other cases the justice may, i11 his discretion, require surety £01-­
