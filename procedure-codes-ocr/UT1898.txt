§ 2983. Verification, how made and by whom. Every pleading must
be subscribed by the party or his attorney. When the complaint is verified, or
when the state or any state officer in his official capacity is plaintiff, all subsequent
pleadings, except demurrers, must be verified, unless an admission of the truth
of the allegation might subject the party to a criminal prosecution, or unless a
state officer in his official capacity is defendant. The affidavit of verification
must state that the pleading is true to the knowledge of the deponent, except as
to the matters therein stated on information and belief, and that as to those he
believes it to be true. Such verification must be made by a party, unless all the
parties are absent from the county where the action is brought, or from some
other cause unable to verify it, or the facts are within the knowledge of the attor
ney or other person verifying the same. The affidavit may also be made by the
agent or attorney, if the action or defense is founded upon a written instrument
for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the
agent or attorney. When the pleading is verified by the attorney or other person,
except one of the parties, the verification must show the reason why it is not
made by a party, and that the matters stated are true to the best knowledge,
information, and belief of the deponent. "When a corporation is a party, the
verification may be made by any officer or agent thereof. Amendments may be
made without being verified, unless a new and distinct cause of action or coun
terclaim is thereby introduced, in which case they shall be verified as other
pleadings. [C. L. § 3234*.

the defendant, must be attached by filing with the recorder of the county a copy
of the writ, together with a description of the property attached and a notice that
it is attached, and by leaving a similar copy of the writ, description, and notice
with an occupant of the property, if there is one, if not then by posting the same
in a conspicuous place on the property attached.
§ 2. Real property or an interest therein belonging to the defendant and held
by any other person, or standing on the records of the county in the name of any
other person, must be attached by filing with the recorder of the county a copy
of the writ, together with a description of the property and a notice that such
real property and any interest of the defendant therein, held by or standing in
the name of such other person, naming him, are attached; and by leaving
with the occupant, if any, and with such other person or his agent if known and
within the county, or at the residence of cither, if within the county, a copy of

orderly file, and shall make an entry thereof in his record of chattel mortgages.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, an attachment may, by direc
tion of the plaintiff or his attorney, be levied upon the property mentioned in

of the court, the taking of the property into the custody of the sheriff was unnec
essary.
§ 5. Stocks or shares, or interest in stocks or shares, of any corporation or
company, must be attached by leaving with the president, or other head of the

ment, together with the costs of the action and proceedings, and if there be a
surplus of such property, or of the proceeds thereof, it shall bo restored to the
defendant. If the answer shows that the garnishee is indebted to the defendant,
then, if the plaintiff recover j udgment against the defendant in the action, the
court shall also enter judgment in favor of the defendant for the use of the plaintiff
against the garnishee for the amount of the indebtedness admitted in the answer;
provided, that the judgment against the garnishee shall not be for a greater sum
than is necessary to satisfy the judgment of the plaintiff against the defendant,

§ 3098. Judgment against garnishee on failure to answer. If the
garnishee, having been duly served with the writ of garnishment and interroga
tories, refuses or fails to answer the interrogatories within the time required, the
plaintiff may enter a default against him and proceed before the court to prove
the liability of the garnishee, according to the provisions of this chapter, (and in
such case the garnishee may be compelled to give testimony as a witness as
in other cases), and upon a verdict or finding in that behalf the plaintiff may

same as if the garnishee had answered according to such verdict or finding;
provided, that if the verdict or finding be as favorable to the garnishee as his
answer, he shall recover costs of the proceeding against the plaintiff, otherwise
the plaintiff may recover costs against the garnishee.

§ 3101. Third person may be interpleaded. Notice. Proceedings.
When the answer of the garnishee shall disclose that any other person than the
defendant claims the indebtedness or property in his hands, and the name and

property, and have a receipt therefor, which shall be a complete discharge from all liability to any party for the amount so paid or property so delivered. Such
notice shall be served in the manner required for service of a summons in a civil
action. Upon such service being made such claimant shall be deemed a defend
ant to the garnishee action and shall answer within ten days setting forth his
claim, or any defense which the garnishee might have made. In case of default,

§ 3134. Id. Testimony of witnesses present may be taken. Order
when mining case continued. The party obtaining a postponement of a
trial must, if required by the adverse party, consent that the testimony of any witness of such adverse party, who is in attendance, be then taken by deposition
before a judge or clerk of the court in which the case is pending, or before such
other officer as the court may direct, which must accordingly be done, and the
testimony so taken may be read on the trial with the same effect, and subject to
the same objections, as if the witnesses were produced. In actions involving the
title to mining claims, if it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that
in order that justice may be done and the action fairly tried on its merits, it is
necessary that further developments should be made, and that the party applying
has been guilty of no laches and is acting in good faith, the court shall grant the
postponement of the trial of the action, giving the party a reasonable time in
which to prepare for trial. And in granting such postponement, the court may,
in its discretion, annex as a condition thereto, an order that the party obtaining such
|K)stponement shall not, pending the trial of the action, remove from the prem
ises in controversy any valuable quartz, rock, earth, or ores, and for any violation
of an order so made, the court, or judge thereof, may punish for contempt as in

§ 3179. Judgment on failure to answer. Judgment may be had, if
the defendant fail to answer the complaint, as follows :
§ 1. In an action arising upon contract for the recovery of money or damages
only, if no answer, demurrer, or motion has been filed with the clerk of the court
within the time specified in the summons, or such further time as may have been
granted, and the complaint and proof of service of summons shall have been filed,
the clerk, upon application of the plaintiff, must enter the default of the defendant,
and immediately thereafter enter judgment for the amount specified in the com
plaint, including the costs, against the defendant, or against one or more of
several defendants, in the cases provided for in section twenty-nine hundred and
fifty-four. If the complaint shall not have been verified, it must be verified
before judgment is entered.
§ 2. In other actions, if no answer, demurrer, or motion has been filed with
the clerk of the court within the time specified in the summons, or such further
time as may have been granted, and the complaint and proof of service of the
summons shall have been filed, the clerk must enter the default of the defendant,
and thereafter the plaintiff may apply for the relief demauded in the complaint.
If the taking of an account or the proof of any fact is necessary to enable the
court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take
the account or hear the proof, or may in its discretion order a reference for that
purpose. And where the action is for the recovery of damages, in whole or part,
the court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury; or, if to determine the
amount of damages, the examination of a long account is necessary, by a reference
as above provided.
§ 3. In actions where the service of the summons was by publication or
personal service out of the state, the plaintiff, upon the expiration of the time for
answering, may, upon proof of service, and that no answer, demurrer, or motion
has been filed, apply for judgment; and the court must thereupon require proof
to be made of the demand mentioned in the complaint, and if the defendant be
not a resident of the state, must require the plaintiff, or his agent, to be examined
on oath respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any
one for his use, on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the
amount or other relief which he is entitled to recover. [C. L. § 3345*.

§ 4. By the court, when upon the trial and before the final submission of
the case the plaintiff abandons it.
§ 5. By the court upon motion of the defendant, when upon the trial the
plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case for the jury; provided, that the offering of
evidence after the overruling of a motion for a nonsuit shall not be deemed or
considered a waiver of the exception taken by the defendant to the order over
ruling such motion.

on the application of the purchaser, or the judgment creditor. But it is not waste
for the person in possession of the property at the time of sale, or entitled to pos
session afterward, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use
it in the same manner in which it was previously used; or to use it in the ordi
nary course of husbandry; or to make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon,
or to use wood or timber on the property therefor, or for the repair of fences, or

§ 3267. Purchaser or redemptioner entitled to rents. Accounting.
Extension of period. The purchaser from the time of sale until a redemp
tion, and a redemptioner from the time of his redemption until another
redemption, is entitled to receive from the tenant in possession the rents of the
property sold or the value of the use and occupation thereof. But when any
rents or profits have been received by the judgment creditor or purchaser, or his
or their assigns, from the property thus sold, preceding such redemption, the
amounts of such rents and profits shall be a credit upon the redemption money to
be paid, and if the redemptioner or judgment debtor before the expiration of the
time allowed for such redemption, demands in writing of such purchaser or cred
itor or his assigns, a written and verified statement of the amounts of such rents aud profits thus received, the period for redemption is extended five days after
such sworn statement is given by such purchaser or his assigns to such redemptioner or debtor. If such purchaser or his assigns shall for a period of one month
from and after such demand fail or refuse to give such statement, such redeniptioner or debtor may, within sixty days after said demand, bring an action in
any court of competent jurisdiction, to compel an accounting and disclosure of
such rents and profits, and until fifteen days from and after the final determina
tion of such action, the right of redemption is extended to such redemptioner or
debtor. [C. L. § 3449.

§ 3268. Remedies of purchaser dispossessed through irregularity
or defect. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successors
in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in the proceed

recover the price paid with interest from the judgment creditor. If the purchaser
of property at an officer's sale or his successor in interest fail to recover possession
in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale or because
the property sold was not subject to execution and sale, the court having jurisdic
tion thereof, must, after notice, and on motion of such party in interest, or his
attorney, revive the original judgment in the name of the petitioner for the
amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from the time
of payment at the same rate that the original judgment bore; and the judgment
so revived has the same force and effect as would an original judgment of the
date of the revival, and no more. [C. L. § 3450.

another, and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale of
his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. In
such cases, the person so paying or contributing is entitled to the benefit of the
judgment, to enforce contribution or repayment, if, within ten days after his ]>ayment, he files with the clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered,
notice of his payment and claim to contribution or repayment. Upon filing of
such notice, the clerk must make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket.

which he or it unjustly refusesto apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment,
such court or judge may, by l&if order, require the judgment debtor, or, if a cor

judge, or referee appointed by him, to answer concerning the same, and such pro

return of an execution. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judg
ment debtor, the judge may, upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or
attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the debtor absconding, order
the sheriff of the county to arrest the debtor, and bring him before such judge.
Upon being brought before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into an under
taking, with sufficient surety, that he will attend from time to time, before the
judge or referee, as may be directed during the pendency of the proceedings, and
until the final determination thereof, and will not. in the meantime, dispose of

into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison. [C. L. § 3453*.

order that the certified copy of the judgment, together with the order, be recorded by the recorder of de.eds of the county where the real property is situated: and
when recorded, it shall give to the person entitled to such conveyance a right to
the possession of the real property described in the judgment, and to hold the
same according to the terms of the conveyance ordered, in like manner as if it

§ 3286. Preparation, settlement, and signing of bill of exceptions.
Time allowed. When a party desires to have exceptions taken at a trial
settled in a bill of exceptions, he may, within thirty days after the entry of judg
ment if the action were tried with a jury, or after receiving notice of the entry of
judgment if the action were tried without a jury, or after the determination of a
motion for a new trial, prepare the draft of a bill, and serve the same, or a copy
thereof, upon the adverse party. Such draft must contain all the exceptions
taken upon which the party relies. Within ten days after such service the
adverse party may propose amendments thereto, and serve the same, or a copy
thereof, upon the other party. The proposed bill and amendments must, within
ten days thereafter, be presented by the party seeking the settlement of the bill
to the judge who tried or heard the case, upon five days' notice to the adverse
party, or be delivered to the clerk of the court for the judge. When received by
the clerk he must immediately deliver them to the judge, if he be in the county;
if he be absent from the county and either party desire the papers to be for
warded to the judge, the clerk must, upon notice in writing from such party,
immediately forward them by mail or other safe channel ; if not thus forwarded,
the clerk must deliver them to the judge immediately after his return to the
county. When received from the clerk, the judge must designate the time at
which he will settle the bill, and the clerk must immediately notify the parties
of such designation. At the time designated the judge must settle the bill. If
no amendments are served, or if served are allowed, the proposed bill may be
presented, with the amendments, if any, to the judge for settlement, without
notice to the adverse party. It is the duty of the judge, in settling the bill, to
strike out of it all redundant and useless matter, so that the exceptions may be
presented as briefly as possible. When settled, the bill must be signed by the
judge, with his certificate to the effect that the same is allowed, and shall then be filed with the clerk. A bill of exceptions shall in all cases be prepared, settled,
signed, and filed within ninety days after the entry of judgment, or after notice
of the same if the action were tried without a jury, or after the determination of
a motion for a new trial. [C. L. § 3395*.

Evidence justifying judgment. A judgment
for defendant cannot be reversed as against evi
dence, where the burden was on plaintiff to prove
that the laud sued for was not within certain excep
tions of a grant, and the record, though not appear
ing to contain all the evidence, fails to show that
such proof was made. Corinne Mill, Canal & Stock
Co. v. Johnson, 5 U. 147; 13 P. 17; 156 U. S. 574.
Where the court below refused to modify the
decree for alimony; held, that such question is one
of fact, and that the evidence though conflicting
was sufficient to support the judgment. Snow v.
Snow, 13 U. 15; 43 P. 620.
Deceased came to his death while descending
defendant's mine. A nonsuit was granted on evi
dence respecting the manner of his descent which
the court regarded as the cause contributing to the
loss of his life; but as there were reasons and theo
ries upon which the manner of descent might be
reconciled, not only with reasonable care but safety
on the part of the deceased, and as there was fur
ther evidence to show gross negligence on the part
of the defendant in not repairing and keeping in
a safe condition the ladder upon which deceased
descended, it was error in the court to grant a non
suit. Eeese v. Morgan S. Mining Co., — U. —; 49
P. 824.
Evidence not Justifying judgment. Where
evidence is too indefinite to support the findings,
they will be set aside and cause remanded for fur
ther testimony. Elliot v. Whitmore, 8 U. 253: 30
P. 984. And verdict manifestly against the undis
puted evidence. Helfrich v. Ogden City By. Co.,
§ 7 U. 186; 26 P. 295.
Where the. findings of fact on a material issue are
clearly in contravention of the preponderance of
evidence and so manifestly erroneous as to amount
to an oversight or inadvertence on the part of the
court, the facts so found and the decree entered
thereon may be modified by the supreme court so
as to conform with the weight of evidence. Salt
Lake City v. Colladge, 13 TJ. 522; 45 P. 891.
When the findings and judgment are without
any testimony to support them, it is the duty of the
court to set aside the judgment or the exception to
the findings. Eastman v. Gurrey, 14 U. 169; 49 P.
§ 310.
Rulings on evidence. Specifications of errors
of law cannot be considered as specifications of
particulars in which the evidence was insufficient
Cunnington v. Scott, 4 U. 446; 11 P. 578.
Where the value of an animal was not disputed
and plaintiff and another witness testified that it
Wiis worth $150, a verdict in that sum was war
ranted although plaintiff gave as a reason for his
valuation that ho bad been offered that sum for the
animal. Johnson v. R. G. W. Ey. Co., 7 U. 346; 96
P. 926.
It is harmless error to admit evidence that the
rolling stock of the defendant company was all in
bad condition, where it is admitted that the acci
dent was occasioned by the defective condition of
the coupling. Wells v. D. & E. G. W. By. Co., 7 U.
§ 482; 27 P. 688.
Impeachment of a witness on an immaterial point
is not ground for reversal of a case. Godbc-Pitts
Drug Co. v. Allen, S U. 117; 29 P. 881.
A judgment will not be reversed for error in
excluding testimony which is cumulative only, if
it is apparent that, if received, it would not affect
the result. Cannon v. Pratt, 99 U. S. 619; same
case, Pr.itt V. Young, 1 U. 347.
Where objection to a certain question has been
erroneously sustained, but the information called
for is subsequently given to the jury, it will not be
regarded as reversible error. State Bank of Utah
v. Burton-Gardner Co., — U. —; 48 P. 402.
On cross examination, an agreement was offered
in evidence by the defendants and excluded be
cause they had not set it up in their answer; after
wards, it was set up in an amended answer and
admitted; held, that its exclusion in the first in
stance would not constitute reversible error. Id.
Evidenceof formeracts of negligence erroneously
admitted for plaintiff will not be regarded reversi
ble error if similar evidence is afterward admitted
for defendant on question of want of due care on
the part of the plaintiff. Sullivan v. Salt Lake
City, 13 U. 12-2; 44 P. 1039.
Reversible error. Total absence of findings is
reversible error. Reich v. Rebellion M. Co., 3 U.
§ 251; 2 P. 703. Blumenthal v. Asay, 3 U. 507; 24 P.
l'fxi. But see llayues v. Roberts, 4 U. 405; 11 P.
§ 51-2.
Findings which are indefinite and uncertain, and
do not settle the rights of the parties is reversible
error. Nephi Irr. Co. v. Jeukius, 8 U. 369; 31 P.
Where the court rejected a proposed paper as a
statement upon motion for a new trial and settled
the same as a bill of exceptions; held, error. McGrath v. Tallent, 7 U. 256; 26 P. 574.
A judgment for plaintiff in an action to recover
on certificates of deposit alleged to have been
assigned to plaintiff in consideration of $1,000 will
lie reversed where the consideration is attacked for
fraud, and the court fails to find any consideration
for the assignment. Turner v. Utah Title Ins. &
Trust Co., 10 U. 61; 37 P. 91.
In an action for breach of contract the court
charged that it was conceded that the contract was
made: exception being taken, the court called the
jury bark ami reiustructed the jury in such amanner as to give it the impression, in the judgment
of the supreme court, that the judge considered
the existence of the contract to be settled, and that
he merely submitted that fact to the jury out of
deference to defendant's denial; held, error. Hawley v. Corey, 9 U. 175; 33 P. 695.
When trial court erred in instructing the jury, in
spite whereof they found a proper verdict supported
by the evidence, on appeal from order setting aside
such verdict as against law, and granting new trial,
the same will be reversed and original verdict rein
stated. Krautz v. R. G. W. By. Co., 12 U. 104; 41
P. 717.
Where it is clear almost beyond reasonable con
troversy that the instructions of the court to the
jury respecting the question of damages had been
disregarded, the supreme court may order a new
trial; the same influence which caused the jury to
disregard the instructions of the court may have
misled them in passing upon other questions in the
case. Wright v. Southern Pacific Co., 14 U. 383; 46
P. 375.
Upon a writ of error to Teverse a judgment by
default, such defects in the complaint as could
have been taken advantage of before judgment by
general demurrer may be reviewed, and if the
judgment would have been reversed on motion, if
made, because the complaint did not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, it may be
reversed for the same reason upon error. McAl
lister v. Kuhn, 1 U. 273; 196 U. S. 87.

A judgment will not be reversed for refusal to
give an instruction abstractly correct where the
facts upon which the instruction is based are nega
tived by the verdict. Snell v. Crowe, 3 U. 26; 5 P.
§ 522.
It is not reversible error to fail to make findings
on material issues when they would necessarily
have been prejudicial to the appellant when the
facts already found are sufficient to sustain the judg
ment. Groome v. Ogden City, 10 U. 54; 37 P. 90.
Where plaintiff's show contract but no damages,
granting nonsuit is not reversible error. Ternes v.
Dunn, 7 U. 497; 27 P. 692.
Where plaintiff' both demurred and answered to
cross-complaint, it not appearing that demurrer
was ever called to the court's attention, failure to
rule thereon is not reversible error. Darke v.
Smith. 14 U. 35; 45 P. 1006.
Where a decree is entered in which it is recited
that findings of fact and conclusions of law have
been filed, and in the findings, after setting forth
the facts underseven subdivisions, thereis added the
following : " Upon the conclusions of law and
the foregoing facts, the court finds that the plain
tiffs have no cause of action herein against the
defendants, and the defendants are entitled to a
judgment against the plaintiff's for the costs of this
action taxed at $——" ; held, that the same is suffi
cient as a conclusion of law. Blish v. McCornick,
— U. —, 49 P. 529.
Objections waived. Where counsel, by stipu
lation, agreed that the statement on motion for a
new trial was full, true, and correct, and that the
same might be settled by the court, reserving only
the objection "that no statement was mad*
within the time provided by law, and that no order
of the court was obtained extending the time," an
objection raised for the first time in this court, that
the notice was defective,*will be regarded as waived.
Hamilton v. Dooly, — U. —; 49 P. 769.
Where both parties have admitted certain facts
to be true, neither of them, on appeal, will be heard

by the party applying, may direct the jury to presume them to be such as he
alleges them to be; and the court may also punish the party refusing for a con
tempt. This section is not to be construed to prevent a party from compelling

ment shall be entered for the restitution of the premises; and, if the proceeding
be for unlawful detainer after neglect or failure to perform any condition or cove
nant of the lease or agreement under which the property is held, or after default
in the payment of rent, the judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of such
lease or agreement. The jury, or the court, if the proceeding be tried without a
jury, shall also assess the damages occasioned to the plaintiff by any forcible entry,
or by any forcible or unlawful detainer, and any amount found due the plaintiff
by reason of waste of the premises by the defendant during the tenancy, alleged
in the complaint and proved on the trial, and find the amount of any rent due,
if the alleged unlawful detainer be after default in the payment of rent ; and the
judgment shall be rendered against the defendant guilty of the forcible entry, or
forcible or unlawful detainer, for the rent and for three times the amount of the
damages thus assessed. When the proceeding is for an unlawful detainer after
default in the payment of the rent, and the lease or agreement under which the
rent is payable has not by its terms expired, execution upon the judgment shall
not be issued until the expiration of five days after the entry of the judgment,
within which time the tenant, or any subtenant, or any mortgagee of the term,
or other party interested in its continuance, may pay into court for the landlord,
the amount of the judgment and costs, and thereupon the judgment shall be
satisfied, and the tenant be restored to his estate; but, if payment, as herein
provided, be not made within the five days, the judgment may be enforced for its full amount, and for the possession of the premises. In all other eases the
judgment may be enforced immediately. [C. L. §§ 3801, 3802*.

thereon pertaining to the realty, and of each and every separate estate or interest
therein ; if it consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and of each
estate or interest therein shall be separately assessed.
§ 2. If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a large
parcel, the damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned,

construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff.
§ 3. If the property, though no part thereof is taken, will be damaged by the
construction of the proposed improvement, the amount of such damages.
§ 4. Separately, how much the portion not sought to be condemned, and each
estate or interest therein, will be benefited, if at all, by the construction of the
improvement proposed by the plaintiff; and if the benefit shall be equal to
the damages assessed, under subdivision two of this section, the owner of the
parcel shall be allowed no compensation except the value of the portion taken ;
but if the benefit shall be less than the damages so assessed, the former shall be
deducted from the latter, and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed
in addition to the value of the portion taken.
§ 5. If the property sought to be condemned be for a railroad, the cost of
good and sufficient fences along the line of such railroad between such railroad
and other adjoining lands of the defendant ; and the cost of cattle guards where
fences may cross the line of such railroad.

account thereof. The defendant, who is entitled to the money paid into court
for him upon any judgment, shall be entitled to demand and receive the same
at any time thereafter upon obtaining an order therefor from the court. It shall
be the duty of the court or a judge thereof, upon application being made by such
defendant, to order and direct that the money so paid into court for him be
delivered to him upon his filing a satisfaction of the judgment, or upon his filing
a receipt therefor, and an abandonment of all defenses to the action or proceeding,
