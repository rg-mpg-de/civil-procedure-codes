TO ESTABLISH .:!',·CODE OF· CIVIL :PRACTICE 
Be it enacted by the General AssemlJ/;y 
SEC. 1. Remedies in civil cases in the Courts of this State,
are divided into two classes-1st, Actions ; 2d, Special Proceedings. 
SEC. 2. A civil action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of
justice, by one party against another, for the enforcement or pro­
tection of a private right, or the redress or prevention of a private
wrong. It may also be brought, in certain cases, for the recevery
of a penalty or a forfeiture. 
SEC. 3. Every other remedy in a civil case is a special pro­
ceeding. 
SEC. 4. The forms of all actions and suits heretofore existing
are abolished ; · and hereafter, there shall be bnt one form of ac­ 
tion for the enforcement or protection of private rights, and the
redress or prevention of private wronge,~hich shall be called a 
civil action. 
SEC. 5. In such action, the party complaining is known as the
plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant. 
SEC. 6. The proceedings in a civil action may be ot two kinds;
1, Ordinary-2, Equitable. 
SEc. 7. The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable 
proceedings, in all caaes where Courts of' Equity, before the adop­ 
tien of this Code, had jurisdiction; and must so proceed in all
cases where such jurisdiction was exclusive. 
SEC. 8. In all other cases, except in this Code otherwise pro­
vided, the plaintiff must prosecute his action by ordinary pro~eed­
ings. 
SEC. 9. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceedings
adopted shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of the action,
but merely a change into the proper proceedings, by an amend­
ment in the pleadings, and a transfer of the action to the proper
docket. 
SEC. 10. The error mentioned in the last section may be cor­
rected by the plaintiff, without motion, at any time before the de­
fendant has answered ; or, afterwards, on motion, in Court. 
SEC. 11. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correc­
tion made, in the following cases: Where the action has been
cemmenced by equitable proceedings, the defendant, by motion
made, at the time of filing his answer, may have them changed
into ordinary proceedings, when it appears that by the provisions
of section eight, the plaintiff should have adopted ordinary pro­
ceedings, and in addition that hie answer presents a defense on
which he is entitled to trial by jury. · 
SEC. 12. Where the action has been commenced by ordinary
proceedings, the defendant, by motion made, at, or before, the
time of filing hie answer may have them changed into equitable
proceedings, when it appears that, by the provisions of section
seven, the plaintiff should have adopted equitable proceedings. 
SEC. 13. Where the action has been properly commenced by 
ordinary proceedings, either party shall have the right, by motion,
to have any issue, which before the adoption of this Code was ex­
clusively cognizable in equity, tried in the manner hereinafter pre­
scribed in cases of equitable proceedings ; and if all the issues are
such as, before the adoption of this Code, were cognizable in 
equity, though none were exclusively so, the defendant shall be 
entitled to have them all tried as in cases of equitable pro­
ceedings. 
SEC. 14. If the plaintiff's claim is for money due by contract,
and the defendant puts in a defense of exclusively equitable cog­
nizance, upon the plaintiff filing an affidavit that he verily believes
that he will succeed in the action, and that the collection of his 
claim after judgment will be endangered by the delay arising from
such defense being put in, the Court shall require the defendant
to give security for the payment of any judgment, the plaintiff
may obtain in the action, and upon his failure to give such secu­
rity, shall order the defendant to pay into Court an amount suffi­
cient to discharge the plaintiff's claim and his probable costs ; 
upon :which order execution may be issued as upon a judgment,
and the amount collected upon execution shall be brought into 
Court and await the decision of the action, and be paid to the
plaintiff or defenbant, according to such decision. But no such
security shall be re~uired, if the trial ot the equitable defence takes
place during the term at which it is put in, nor until all defences
to the action, other than those of equitable cognizance, are tried
or disposed of in favor of the plaintiff. 
SEC. 15. An error as to the kind of proceedings adopted in the
action, is waived by failure to move for its correction at the time
and in the manner prescribed in this chapter; and all errors in the
decisions of the Court, on any of the motions named in this chap­
ter, are waived, unless excepted to at the time; which may be
done by the clerk noting at the end of such decision words ef the
following import: "To which decision the plaiutiff (or defendant)
excepts." 
SEC. 16. The provisions of this Code concerning the prosecu­
tion of a civil action, apply to both kinds of proceedings, whether 
ordinary or equitable, unless the contrary appears.
SEC. 17. Judgment obtained in an action by ordinary proceed­ 
ings, shall not be annulled or modified by any order in an action
by equitable proceedings, except for a defence which has arisen or
been discovered since the judgment was rendered. But such
judgment does not prevent the recovery of any claim, though such 
claim might have been used by way of set-off, counter-claim, or
cross demand, in the action on which the judgment was recovered. 
SEC. 18. The rule of the common law that statutes in deroga­
tion thereof are to be strictly construed, has no application to this
Code. Its provisions and all proceedings under it, shall be liber­
ally construed with a view to promote its object and assist the par­
ties in obtaining justice. 
SEc. 19. The Supreme Court shall be held at the Capital of
this State. 
SEC. 20. There shall be two terms a year, one commencing
on the first Monday in June, and the other on the first Monday 
of December.
SEC. 21. The sheriff of the county where the Court is held, or 
his deputy, must attend upon the Court, and shall receive two
dollars a day for such attendance. 
SEC. 22. The ameunt appropriated by the General Assembly
therefor, shall limit the contingent expenses, which shall be al­
lowed said court. 
SEC. 23. The presence of two judges is necessary for
the transaction of business, but one alone may adjourn from day
to day, or to any particular day, or until the next term. 
SEC. 24. When the Court is equally divided in opinion,
the cause must stand for a re-argument, unless the third judge be
legally disqualified from sitting, In such case the judgment of
the District Court shall stand affirmed, but the decision is of no
further force or authority. 
SEC. 25. If all the judges fail to attend on the first day
of the term, the clerk must enter the fact upon the record, and
the Court shall stand adjourned until the next day. The same 
proceedings shall be repeated from day to day, until the fourth
day of the term, when if none of the judges appear, the Court
shall stand adjourned until the next term. 
SEC. 26. No process or proceeding is in any manner
affected by an adjournment or failure to bold Court, but all shall
stand continued to the next term, without any special order to
that effect. 
SEC. 27. The Supreme Court has an appellate jurisdic­
tion over all judgments and decisions of any of the District Courts
as well in case of civil actions properly so called, as in proceed­ 
ings of a special or independent character.
SEc. 28. The following orders may also be carried, by appeal, 
to the Supreme Court : 
1st. An order made affecting a. substantial right in an action,
when such order, in effect, determines the action and prevents a 
judgment from which an appeal might be taken.
2d. A final order made in special proceedings affecting a sub­ 
stantial right therein, or made on a summary application in an
action after judgment. 
3d. When an order grants or refuses, continues or modifies a
provisional remedy, or grants, refuses, dissolves, or refuses to dis­
solve an injunction or attachment, when it grants or refuses a new
trial, or when it sustains or overrules a demurrer . 
. 4th. An intermediate order involving the merits and material­
ly affecting the final decision. 
5th. An order or judgment on habeas corpus.
SEC. 29. If any of the above orders are made by a judge of 
the District Court, the same is reviewable in the same way as if 
made by the Court.
SEC. 30. The Court may also in its discretion, prescribe 
rules for allowing appeals, on such other intermediate orders or ,
decisions as they think expedient, and for permitting the same to
be taken and tried during the progress of the trial in the Court
below; but such intermediate appeals must not retard preceed­
ings in the trial in chief in the District Court. 
SEC. 31. The Court may issue all writs and process
necessary for the exercise and enforcement of its appellate juris­
diction. 
SEC. 32. The opinions of the Court on all questions re­
viewed on appeal as well as such motions, collateral questions
and points of practice as they may think of sufficient importance,
shall be reduced to writing, and filed with the clerk of the Ooart, 
SEC. 33. All dissenting opinions must be written and
filed in the same manner. 
SEC. 34. The records and reports must in all cases
show whether a decision was made by a full bench, and whether
either, and if so which, of the judges dissented from the decision. 
SEC. 35. The Supreme Court has a general supervision
over the District Court to prevent and correct abuses where no
other remedy is provided for by law. 
SEC. 36. The Supreme Court shall hold argument terms at
the city of Davenport, in the county of Scott, twice a year, one
beginning on the first Monday in April, and the other the first
Monday of October. ,

not go to the Davenport term, unless by consent of parties ex­
pressed in the notice of appeal. 
SEC. 40. The Court at the Davenport term, shall have the
same powers, and be governed by the same rules, and the duties
of all the officers thereof shall be the same as at the term at the
Capital, so far as the same are applicable to a term which is only 
one for argument. ,
SEC. 41. Each judge of the Supreme Court shall have as mile­ 
age for the Davenport term, going and returning, ten cents for
each mile by the nearest practicable route, and the clerk thereof
shall have five dollars a day, for each day of the session of such

cisions of said Court. His report of a case shall contain the date

lowed by the legal propositions made by counsel in. the argument

ment at length.

the real party in interest, except as provided in the next section. 
SEC. 159. An Executor or Admisinstrator, a guardian, a trustee
of an express trust, a party with whom, or in whose name a con­
tract is made for the benefit of another, .or a party expressly author­
ized by Statute, may sue in his own name without joining with
him the party for whose benefit the suit is prosecuted. . 
Sso, 160. All persons having an interest in the subject of the
action, and in obtaining the relief demanded, may be joined as
plaintiffs, except where it is otherwise provided in this Code. 
SEC. 161. In case of an assignment of a thing in action, the
action by the assigned shall be without prejudice to any set-off or
other defence existing before notice. of the assignment ; but this section shall not apply to negotiable instruments transferred in 
good faith and upon valuable consideration before due.
SEC. 162. Any person may be made a defendant who has or 
claims an interest in the controversy adverse to the plaintiff, or
who is a necessary party to a complete determination or settle­
ment of the question involved in the action. 
SEC. 163. Persons ha Ting an united interest must be joined on
the same side, either as plaintiffs or defendants. But when some
who should thus be made plaintiffs refuse to join, they may be
made defendants ; the reason thereof· being set forth in the peti­
tion. 
SEC. 164. When the question is one of a common or general
interest to inany persons: or when the parties are very numerous
and it is impracticable to bring them all before the Court, one or 
more may sue or defend for the benefit of the whole.
SEC. 165. Where two or more persons are bound by contract, 
or by judgment, decree or statute, whether jointly only or jointly ,
and severally, or severally only, and including the parties tone­
gotiable paper, common orders, and checks, and sureties on the 
same, or separate instruments-the action theresn may, at the
plaintiff's option, be brought against any or all of them. When
any 'of those so bound are dead, the action may be brought against 
any or all of the survivors, with any or all of the representatives
of the decedents--or against any or all such representatives. 
An action or judgment against any one or more of several per­
sons jointly bound, shall not be a bar to proceedings against the 
others.
SEc. 166. The Court may determine any controversy between 
parties before it when it can ht, done without prejudice to the
rights of others, or by saving their rights. But when a determi- 
· nation of the controversy between the parties betore the Court

must order them to be brought in. 
SEc. 167. When in an action for the recovery of real or per­
sonal property, any person having an interest in the property ap­
plies to be made a party, the Court may order it to be done by
the proper amendment. 
SEC. 168. Upon affidavit of a defendant before answer in any
action upon contract for the recovery of personal property, that
some third party without ,collusion with him, has, or makes a claim
to the subject of the action, or on proof thereof as the Court may
direct, the Court may make an order for the safe , keeping, or for
the payment or deposit in Oosrt, or deli very of the subject of the
action to such person as it may direct, and an order requiring such 
third :person to appear in a reasonable time and :maintain or relin­
quish his claim against the defendant, and in the mean time stay
the proceedings. 
If such third party, being served with a copy of the o. der, fails
.to appear, the Court may declare him barred of all claim in re­ 
spect to the subject of the action against the defendant therein. 
If such third person appears, he shall be allowed to make himself
defendant in the action in lieu of the original defendant who shall
be discharged from all liability to either of the other parties in re­
spect to the subject of the action upon his compliance with the
order of the Court for the payment, deposit, or deli very thereof. 
SEc. 169. The provisions of the last section shall be applicable 
to an action brought against a Sheriff, or other officer, for the re. 
eovery of personal property taken by him under an attachment or
execution, or for the proceeds of such property so taken and sold
by him. And the defendant in any such action shall be entitled
to the benefit of these provisions against the party in whose favor
the attachment or execution issued, upon exhibiting to the Court 
the process under which he acted, with his affidavit that the prop­
erty, for the recovery of which, or its proceeds, the action was
brought, was taken under such process. 
SEC. 170. In an action against a Sheriff or other officer for the
recovery of property taken under an attachment or execution, the
Court may, upon the application of the defendant and of the par­ 
ty in whose favor the process issued, permit the latter to be sub­
stituted as the defendant, sureties tor the costs being given. 
SEC. 171. All action to recover the possession of specific per­
sonal property, taken under a landlord's attachment when it is
brought by the tenant or his assignee or under-tenant, may be
against the party who sued out the attachment ; and the property
claimed by such action, may, under the writ therefor, be taken
from the officer who seized it, when he has no other claim to hold
it than that derived from the writ. The endorsement of a levy
on the property made upon the proeese by the officer holding it,
sha~ be a sufficient taking of the property to sustain the action
against the p~rty who sued out the writ. 
SEC. 172. When a married woman is a party, her husband
must be joined with her, except that, 
1st. When the action concerns her separate property, or is
founded on her own contract, she may sue and be sued alone. 
2d. When the action is between herself and her husband, she
may sue and be sued alone. 
And in no case need she prosecute or defend by guardian or
next friend. 
SEC. 173. When sued alene judgment shall be enforced against
her separate property. 
SEC. 174. When sueing alone, judgment may be enforced
against her separate property or her husband being brought in by
rule, execution may issue against him also, unless for cause he
show that he is not interested in the snit by the wife. 
SEC. 175. If husband and wife are sued together, the wife may
defend for her own right ; and if either neglect to defend, the
other may defend for such one also. 
SEC. 176. In an action brought by a m_an and his wife for an
injury done to the wife, in respect of which she is necessarily 
joined as co-plaintiff, it shall be lawful for the husband to join
thereto claims in his own right. 
SEC. 177. When a husband, being a father, has deserted his 
family, the wife, being a mother, may prosecute or defend in his
name, any action which he might have prosecuted or defended,
and shall have the same powers and rights therein as he might
have had. 
SEC. 178. The action of an infant must be brought by his
guardian or his next friend; but the Court has power to dismiss
it it it is not for the benefit of the infant, or to substitute the guar­
dian of the infant or other person as next friend. 
SEc. 179. The defence ot an infant must be by his regular
guardian, or by a guardian appointed to defend him, where no
regular guardian appears, or where the Court directs a defence by
a guardian appointed for that purpose. No judgment can be ren­
dered against an infant until after a defence by a guardian. 
SEC. 180. The appointment cannot be made until after service
ot the notice in the action as directed by this Code, and may then
be made by the Court or Judge thereof, or during vacation by the
Clerk of the District Court, but the Court shall have power to re­
move such guardian and appoint another instead whenever the in­
terests of the infant require such a change. 
SEC. 181. The appointment may be made upon the application
of the infant if he is of the age of fourteen years, and applies at
or before the term to which the notice is served. If he is under
the age of fourteen, or does not so apply, the appointment may

tion shall also be separated into paragraphs, numbered as such, for
more convenient reference, and each paragraph shall contain, as

jection in the terms of' the preceeding section, except that a de·
murrer to an equitable petition for the fifth reason of section 282,
may be stated in the terms thereof. 
SEc. 284. When any of the matters enumerated in the section
282 do not appear on the face of the petition, the objection may
be taken by an answer. If no such objection is taken either by
demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived
the same, except only the objection that the petition does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or states a fact which
a voids the cause of action. 
SEC. 285. The defendant may demur to one or more of the
several causes of action alleged in the petition and answer, as to
the resldae.

8d. A. specific denial of each allegation of the petition contro­
verted by the defendant, or of any knowledge or information

4:th. A statement of any new matter constituting a defence, in
ordinary and concise language, without repetition. 
5th. A statement of any new matter constituting a set-off, or a
counter-claim, or a cross demand, or a cross-petition, in ordinary

6th. The defendant may set forth in his answer as !llany causes 
of deteace, set-off, counter-claim or cross-demand, whether legal
or equitable, as he may have. 
SEC. 287. Matter of defence as distinguished from setoff,
counter-claim, or cross-demand, is either negative, as for example, 
that which contradicts, in whole or in part, some fact proposition
of tlie petition, or it is affirmative, as for example, that which
states new matter either to avoid some fact proposition of the pe­
tition, or to avoid the legal conclusion of the petition, and all such
negative matter, whether wholly or partly so, should be stated in
one division of the answer. 
SEC. 288. Each affirmative matter of defence shall be stated in
a distinct division of the answer, and must be sufficient in itself
and must intelligibly refer to that part of the petition to which it 
is intended to apply.
SEc. 289. In the defence part of an answer or reply, it shall 
not be necessary to make any prayer ot judgment.
SEC. 290. Each matter of set-off, counter-claim or cross-de­ 
mand, or cross-petition, must be specially stated in a distinct di­
vision. 
SEC. 291. An equitable division must be also separated into
parsgraphs and numbered as is required in regard to an equitable
cause ot action in the petition. 
SEC. 292. The defendant may plead as many matters of de­
tence, negative and affirmative, and as many sets-off, counter­
claims, and cross-demands as he may have.

on contract, and must be a cause of action arising on contract, or

the consent ot hie co-maker or principal, avail himself by way of 
· set-off, of a debt or Jiquidated demand due from the plaintiff at 
the commencement of the a.it to such cs-maker or principal, bot
the plaintiff may meet such set-off in the same way ae if made by 
the co-maker or principal himself.
SEC. 295. Where it appears that a new party is necessary to a 
final decision upon a set-off, the Court shall permit the new party
to be made; if it also appears that owing to the insolvency or
non-residence of the plaintiff, or other cause, the defendant will
be in danger of losing his claim unless permitted to use it as a
set-off. 
SEC. 296. The counter-claim must be a cause of action in favor
of the defendants, or some of them, against the plaintiffs, or some
of them, arising out of the contract or transactions set forth in the
petition as the foundation · of the plaintiff's claim, or connected
with the subject of the action. 
SEC. 297. When it appears that a new party is necessary to a
final decision upon a counter-claim, the Court may either permit
the new party to be made, by a notice to reply to the counter­
claim in the answer, or may direct that it be stricken out of the
answer, and made the subject of a separate action. 
SEC. 298. A statement by way of cross-demand is any new
matter constituting any cause of action in favor of the defendant,
or all the defendants if more than one, against the plaintiff, or
all the plaintiffs, if more than one, and which the defendant or
defendants might have brought when suit was commenced, or 
which was then held, either matured or not, if matured when so
plead. 
SEC. 299. When a defendant has a cause of action, affecting
the subject matter of the action, against a co-defendant, or a per­
son not a party to the action, he may make in his answer a cross­
petition against the co-defendant or other person. 
The defendant thereto, may be netifled as in other cases, and
defence thereto shall be made in the time and manner prescribed
in regard to the original petition, and with the same right of ob­
taining provisionable remedies applicable to the case.

the original action, when a judgment can be readered therein that
will not prejudice the rights of the parties to the cross-petitioa. 
SEC. 300. The guardian ot an infant or person of unsound . .
mind, or attorney for a per son in prison, must deny in the answer : 
t,' 
all the material allegations of the petition, prejudicial to such de­
fendant. 
SEC. 801. When the facts stated in the answer, or any division
thereof are not sufficient to constitute a defence, set-off, counter­
claim, or cross-demand, the adverse party may demur, and shall
be held therein to the same certainty in the statement of his
grounds therefor, 88 obtains in a demurrer to the petition. 
SEC. 302. There shall be no reply except upon the allegations
of a counter-claim, or set-off, or cross-demand, in the answer.

a set-off, counter-claim or cross-demand, the plaintiff may reply to
such new matter. 1st-Denying generally or specifically, each
allegation controverted by him, or any knowledge or information
thereof, sufficient to form a •elief as in case of answer, or 2d-He
may allege in concise and ordinary language, any new matter not 
inconsistent with the petition, constituting a defence to the set-off,
er-claim or cross-demand. 
SEC. 304. Any number of defences, negative or aflirmati ve,
are pleadable to a set-off, counter-claim or cross-demand. 
SEC. 305. All the negative matter of the reply, whether wholly
or partly so, shall be stated in one division-and each affirmative
matter of defence in the reply, shall be stated in a distinct and
separate division, and shall be sufficient in itself, and must intel­
ligibly refer to the part of the answer to which it is intended to
appiy. A division of equitable matter must also be separated into
paragraphs and numbered 88 required, in case ot such matter in 
a ewer.
SEC. 306. When the facts stated in the reply do not amount 
to a sufficient defence, the defendant may demur, subject te the
same requirements of certainty in statements of grounds thereof,
as obtain in demurrer to the petition. 
SEC. 307. The opposite party shall be deemed to join in a de­
murrer, whenever he shall not amend the pleading to which it is
addressed. 
SEC. 308. In all cases in which a denial is made by answer or 
reply, concerning a time, sum, quantity, or place alleged, the party
denying shall declare whether such denial is applicable to every
time, sum, quantity, or place, or not, and if not, what time, sum,
quantity or place, he admits. 
SEC. 309. The counts of the petition must be consecutively
numbered as such, and so must the divisions of the answer as such,
and of the reply as such. 
SEC. 310. If the matter of the petition, answer or reply, is not
put into distinct counts or divisions and numbered as herein con·
templated, or if one such division contains in the petition more
than one cause of action, or if one division in the answer contains
more than one affirmative defence, or set off', or counter-claim, or
cross-demacd, or if one division in the reply contains more than
one affirmative defence to any set-off, counter-claim, or cross-de­
mand, the party so neglecting to divide and number, may, on mo­
tion, be ordered to divide and number, and the party so pleading
double in the contemplation of this section, may be, on motion, or­ 
dered to elect on which part of such double count or division he will
stand, and to strike out the rest of it-or to re-divide such count 
or division, made bad:by such duplicity. 
SEC. 311. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party or
his attorney, and the petition, answer and reply, must each be 
verified by the affidavit of the party to the effect that he believes
the statements thereof to be true. 
SEC. 312. Where a corporation is a party, tlle affidavit may be
made by any officer thereof. 
SEC. 313. When there are several parties united in interest,
the affidavit may be made by any one of them. 
SEC. 314. If the pleading be founded on a written instrument,
for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the
possession of the agent or attorney, the affidavit may be made by 
such agent or attorney. 
SEC. 315. If the statements of the pleading are known to any
person other than the party, such person may make the affidavit. 
SEC. 316. When the affidavit is made by another than the party,
it must also contain averments showing the afliant competent to
make the affidavit according to the feregoing provisions. 
SEC. 317. The verification shall not be required to the answer
of a guardian, of an infant, or person ot unsound mind, or a pris­ 
oner. 
SEC. 318. The verification shall not be required when the ad­
mission of' the truth of the allegations of the petition or answer
might subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecution, and
when it. can be seen from the pleading to be answered, that an ad­
mission ofthe truth of its allegations might s9 subject the party,
his general affidavit that such might be the effect of the admission
without stating the facts leading him te such a conclusion, shall
be received, in lieu of a verification of the pleading. 
SEC. 819. Verification shall not be required to a pleading
grounded on an injury to the person or the character. 
SEC. 320. The affidavit of verification may be made before any '
person, either within or without this State, duly qualified to ad­
minister an oath, and must be signed by the person making the 
same, and the officer before whom the same is taken, shall certify
that it was signed in his presence by the person (naming him) and
by llim, before such officer sworn to or affirmed. That purporting
to be the certificate of such officer, as signed officially, if made
within this State, shall be prim« facie evidence that it is such cer­
tificate, and that its averments are true, and if made without this
State shall be so taken, when made before any one, by our law
qualified to take depositions, but if taken before any officer not se
qaalified, his official certificate must be authenticated as is required
by section -- of this Code. 
SEC. 821. The verification ot the pleading does not apply to
the amount claimed, except in aetiens founded on contract, express
or implied, for the payme~t of money only. 
SEC. 322. The verification shall not make other or greater
proof necessary on the side of the adverse party. 
SEC. 823. If a pleading be not duly verified, it may be struck
out, on motion, but such defect will be deemed waived if the other 
party respond thereto, or proceed to trial without such motion.
SEC. 324. Every material allegation ef the petition not con­ 
troverted by the answer, and every material allegation in the an­
swer of new matter, constituting a set-off, counter-claim or cross­
demand, not controverted by the reply, must for the purposes of
the action, be taken as true. But the allecations of new matter
in the answer, not relating to a set-off, counter-claim or cross-de­
mand, or ot new matter in a reply, is to be deemed co:ntreverted
by the ad verse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance as the
case may require. An allegation of value, or of aaount of dam- 
age, shall not be deemed true by a failure to controvert it, anti an
averment that, of the truth of any stated allegation or allegations
the party has not sutlicient knowledge or information to form a
belief, shall be deemed a sufficient denial to prevent the same from
being taken as true. A party desiring to admit any allegations of
tact, which by this section would otherwise be deemed controver­
ted by mere force of law, may at any time file a written admis- 
sion thereof. ·
SEC. 325. It the action, ~et-off, counter-claim or cross-demand, 
is founded on an account, a bill of particulars must be incorpor­
ated into, or attached to, and filed with the pleading, or such 
pleading will be demurrable, and if not incorporated into it-must
be verified as the pleading. And if the same be not a statement
of such particulars as may be necessary to gi!e the Court and the
other party, reasonable knowledge of the nature and the grounds
of the cause of action, set-off counter-claim or cross-demand, the
Court may, on motion, order it to be made more specific. Such
bill of particulars shall be deemed a part of the pleadings to which
it is annexed, and shall be answered or replied to as such, and as
such shall define and limit the proof, subject, however, to amend­
ment as hereafter provided. The items of a bill of particulars
shall be consecutively numbered, and the party adverse shall an­
swer specifically every item; but he may make one and the same
allegation or denial concerning any number of items to which
such allegation of denial is applicable, specifying the number of
the items thus answered together, when less than the whole . 
SEC. 326. If the adverse party shall 'deny that any item is due
or payable, or that he owes the party as alleged, he must state all
the substantive grounds on which he rests such denial, and shall
specify whether some, and what part of the whole, of such item
or demand is deaied, 
SEC. 327. If the action, set off, counter-claim or cross-demand
is founded on a note, bill, bond, or other writing, as evidence of
indebtedness, a copy thereof must be set out in or annexed to the
pleading, if in the power of the party to procure it. If not so done,
the reason thereof' must be stated in the pleading. If there be no
such copy so· set out or annexed, and no sufficient reason stated for
such omission, it will be sufficient ground for a demurrer to such
pleading. Such pleading must be sufficient in itself, in its aver­ 
ment of facts .. constituting a cause of action, set off, counter-claim 
or cross-demand, without such copy, and such copy shall in no
manner aid as a pleading the averments of the pleading, in which
it is set out by copy, or to which it is so annexed. 
SEC. 328. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a
Court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or deter­
mination may be stated to have been duly given or made. 
SEC. 329. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent
in a contract whether such conditions are expressed or implied, it
shall not be necessary to state the facts constituting such perform­
ance, but a general statement tltat the party duly performed all the 
conditions on his part, or to that substantial effect, shall be suffi­
cient. 
SEC. 830. A plaintiff' suing as a corporation, partnership, exec­
utor, guardian, or in any other way, implying corporate, partner­
ship, representative, or other than individual capacity, need not
state the facts constituting such capacity or relation, but may aver
generally, or as a legal conclusion, such capacity or relation; and
where a defendant is held in such capacity or relation, a plaintiff
may aver such capacity or relation, in the same general way. 
SEC. 331. If the general allegation comtemplated in the three
preceding sections is made in a petition, and is not controverted in
the answer, or made in the answer in relation to a set off, counter­
claim or cross-demand, and not controverted in the reply, each
allegation not so controverted shall, on the trial, be taken as true. 
SEC. 332. If either of the allegations contemplated in sections
326, 327 or 328, is intended to be controverted, it shall not be 
sufficient to controvert it in terms of the allegation. contradictory
of the general proposition intended to be controverted, but it is
necessary to state specifically the facts relied on as a denial of such
proposition. 
SEC. 333. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived there­
from, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and
the day of its passage, and the Court shall thereupon take judicial
notice thereof. 
SEC. 334. In an action for slander or libel, it shall not be nec­
essary to state ia the petition any extrinsic fact for tlie purpose of
showing the application to the plaintiff of any defamatory matter
out of which the cause of action arose, but it shall be sufficient to
state generally that the same was spoken or published concerning 
the plaintiff, nor shall it be necessary to state any prefatory or ex­
trinsic fact for the purpose of showing that such words were used
in a defamatory sense, but it shall be sufficient generally to state
that the words or matter were used in a defamatory sense, specify­
ing such defamatory sense, and where the words or matter set forth,
with or without the alleged meaning, show a cause of action, ,it
shall be sufficient. 
SEC. 335. In actions of slander or libel, the defendant may, in
his answer, allege both. the truth of the matter charged as defama­
tory, and any mitigating circumstances sufficient in law to reduce
the amount of damages ; or he may allege either one of these with­
out the other, and the allegation of the truth of the matter charged
shall not, if the defendant fail to establish it, be deemed, in itself
preof of the malice of such words, but the jury shall decide upon
the whole case, whether such defence was, or was not, made with
malicious intent, and whether he prove the justification or not, he
may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances, but each de­
fence must be separately stated and numbered, and if the defend­ 
ant relies on more than one mitigating circumstance sufficient in
law to reduce the amount of damages, each of such circumstances
must be separately stated and numbered, and sufficient in itself,
and if the defendant relies on the truth of the matter charged,
nothing herein is intended to relax the law of pleading heretofore
in force, as regards the certainty of statement required in such a 
mode of defence. '
SEC. 336. Any person shall be entitled to intervene in an action 
who has an interest in the matter in litigation, in the success of
either ot the parties to the action, or an interest against both. An
intervention takes place when a third party is permitted to become
a party to an action between other persons, either by joining the
plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the petition, or by uniting
with the defendant in resisting the claim of the plaintiff, or by de­
manding anything adversely to both the plaintiff and defendant.
A third person may intervene either before or after issue has been
joined in the cause, and before the trial commences. 
SEC. 337. The Oourt shall determine upon the intervention at
the same time that the action is decided, and the intervenor has no
richt to delay; and if the claim of the intervenor is not sustained,
he shall pay all costs ot the intervention. 
SEC. 338. The intervention shall be by petition filed in the 
Court in which the action is pending, and it must set forth the facts
constituting the grounds on which the intervention rests, and shall
be taken notice of by the adverse party, as any other pleading, on
being served by copy, and shall be responded to in the time which
is allowed for other pleadings of the kind used in such response,
and all the pleadings therein shall be governed by the same prin
ciples and rules as obtain in other pleadings provided for in this 
Chapter. But if such petition is filed during term, the Court shall
direct the time in which an answer shall be filed thereto. 
SEc. 339. In a proceeding against a married woman, growing
out of any contract which she may have the lega1. right to make,
the pleading need not state facts constituting a cause against her
with respect to her separate property, but need only state facts
constituting a cause of action, or set off, or counter-claim, or cross­
demand, against her as a person, and judgment shall be personal. 
SEc. 340. One cause of action, defence, set off, counter-claim,
cross-demand or reply, shall be expressed in but one statement,
and not in various counts or divisions. If such be done, the adverse
party may have to strike out a11 but one ef such counts or divisions,
supporting his motion by an affidavit that the same are for only
one cause of action, whereupon the other party shall either so strike
out at the cost of the motion, or declining, must show on the trial
as many distinct causes as he has counts or di visions, or shall pay 
all the costs of the whole trial. 
SEc. 341. Where a transaction has taken place between th'e
plaintiff and defendant, constituting fn favor of the plaintiff a cause
of' action against the detendant, and where another contemporane­
ous or subsequent transaction growing out of and based upon the
former transaction, has also taken place between them, which may
or may not have operated a merger or displacement of the former 
cause of action-then, if such plaintiff is not clear upon which ot
such transactions he is entitled to recover, he may state in his
petition, in distinct counts, the facts constituting each of such causes
of action, and may pray the reliet proper to each cause of action,
and must also state that he claims to recover but for one ef such
causes; whereupon the defendant may allow judgment to go against
him on either ot such causes in bar of the other; or if the defend­
ant contests both of such cuuses, the plaintiff may, on proper proof,
recover on either, or having obtained verdict on both, may state 
on which one he will have judgment, 'which judgment shall be in
bar of the other. 
The same principles shall obtain in regard to a set off, counter­
claim or cross-demand. 
SEC. 342. Where a transaction has occurred, and if certain facts
thereof should be proved, such proof wo~ld entitle the plaintiff to
one kind or degree of relief, while if other facts thereof were proved,
such proof would entitle the plaintiff to another kind or degree ot
relief; then it the plaintiff cannot determine which group of facts
he can prove, but believes he can prove the one or the other of
such groups, he may state as cause of action in distinct counts, each 
ot such group of tacts, with the relief which he demands thereon, and
that he asks judgment only on one of such group of facts. Where­
upon the parties shall have the same rights, and the same proceed­
ings may be had as are provided for in section 341, and the verifi­
cation of the causes ot action of this section shall be in effect that
the p1aintiff believes one or the other of them true, but cannot
determine which. 
SEc. 343. Contradictory causes of defence or reply may be
stated in an answer or. reply, when the pleading is verified, to the 
same effect as required in the last section.
SEC. 344. Two or more parties making the same defence or 
reply, may do so jointly.
SEc. 345. The pleading may include one count only when the 
same contract was made by each of the adverse parties, but must
include different counts describing the different contracts of the
adverse parties, when, as in the case of maker and endorser, the 
sme contract was not made by all.
SEC. 346. Whenever a party claims a right derogatory from 
the general law, or when his claim is founded upon an exception
of any kind, he shall set forth such c1aim or such exception partic­
ularly in his pleading. 
Sec. 347. Propositions which state matters of law, as contra­
distinguished from those which state matters of fact, must not be
stated in a pleading, but if a proposition which has a meaning 
which would make it matter of law, has also another and a com­
mon sense meaning, which would make it matter of fact, it shall
be taken in the latter meaning and shall be deemed a proposition
of fact. 
Sec. 348. Any defence showing that a contract, written or
oral, or any instrument sued on, is void or voidable; or the fact
that the alleged instrument was delivered to a third person, as an
escrow, or showing matter of justification, excuse, discharge, or
release, and any cause of defence which admits the facts of the
adverse pleading, but by some other matter seeks to avoid their
legal effect, must be specially pleaded. 
Sec. 349. Any defence that admits that an allegation of the
other pleading is true, as an allegation of fact, but assumes that it 
is not true as an allegation of law, and seeks to avoid it by new
matter, must be specially pleaded. · 
Sec. 350. Under a mere denial of an allegation, no evidence.
shall be introduced by, the party so denying, which- does not tend
to negative such an allegation of fact, or to negative some propo­
sition of fact, as contradistinguished from one of law, which the
party having made the controverted allegation, is bound to prove,
in order to sustain such allegation. 
Sec. 351. Propositions which are statements of evidence, as
contradistinguished from propositions which are statements of the 
ultimate results of evidence, should not be stated in any pleading.
Sec. 352. The Court may, on motion of any person aggrieved 
thereby, cause irrelevant or redundant matter to be stricken from
any pleadings, at the cost· ot any party, whose pleading contains 
them. 
Sec. 353. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essential
to the claim or defence, and which could not be stricken from the
pleading without leaving it insufficient. · 
Sec. 354. When the facts on which any pleading is founded,
are stated in a manner so general, or so indefinite, or so uncertain
that the precise nature of the cause of action, or defence, or set­
off, or counter-claim, or cross demand is not so apparent as to en­
able the adverse party to respond intelligibly thereto, the Court
may, on motion, require the pleading to be 'made more specific,
definite, and certain hy amendment, and no pleading which re­ 
cites or refers to a contract, shall be deemed s,nfficiently specific, 
unless it states whether the same is in writing or not.
Such motion shall point out wherein the amendment is required 
or shall be disregarded, and it the reason for such demand of more
specific statement exists outside of the pleadings, the motion must
state the same and be sworn to. 
Sec. 855. The title ot a cause shall not be changed in any of iti
stages of transit from one Court to another. 
Sec. 856. Matters of which judicial notice is taken, need not 
be ststed in a pleading. 
Sec. 857. In the construction ot pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegation& shall be liberally construed,
with a view to substantive justice between the parties. 
Sec. 358. When a party claims by conveyance, he may state
it according to its. legal effeet or name. 
Sec. 859. When a party claims by inheritance, either by im­
mediate or mediate descent, he shall allege how he is heir, as- son, 
nephew, or otherwise.
Sec. 360. It shall not be necessary to allege the commence­ 
ment of either a particular or of a superior estate, unless it be 
essential to the merits of the case.
Sec. 361. When time forms a material point in the merits of 
a cause, the day, month, and year, or when there is a continued
act, the period of its duration must be alleged. When time is not
material, it need not be stated, and if stated, need not be proved. 
Sec. 362. In actions for injuries to goods and chattels, their
kind or species shall be alleged. 
Sec. 363. It shall be neceasary to allege a place, only when it
is descriptive of the eubject matter of the action, and f•rms a pa.rt
of the substance of the issue. 
SEC. 364. In actions for injuries to real property, the party
shall describe the property, and when the injury is to an incorpo­
real hereditament, shall describe the property in respect of which 
the riiht is claimed, as well as the right itself, either by the name
by which the property is designated in the national survey, or by 
its abutals, or by its courses and distances, orby any name which
it has acquired by reputation, certain enough to identify it. 
Sec. 165. When the party intends to prove malice, to affect
damages, be mut aver the same. 
Sec. 366. In an action, se~ff, ecnnter-claim, or cross-demand,

pleading, notice the condition, and allege fact.a constituting the
breach. or breaches relied on. 
Sec. 367. When a plea.ding shows affirmatively, that ite cause
of claim is barred by the, s~tute of limitations, it may be assailed
by demurrer. 
Sec. 868. When the defendant pleads the statute of limita­
tions, responding to such plea the defendant may, witheut leave 
or cost, or incurring delay, amend his petition, by a count averring
as another cause of action, the proper admission or new promise,
with what other matter may be necessary to constitute snfliclen t
cause of such claim, and the plaintiff may recover on either of
such claims as lie may show himself entitled. But he may in the
tirst instance, rely on anti state as cause of action, the matter dis­
placing the bar of the statute as contemplated in the amendment
herein stated. 
Sec. 869. When any pleading shows affirmatively, that its
cause of claim should be evidenced by writing, according to the
law of evidence, and that the same is not BO evidenced, it may be 
assailed by demurrer.
Sec. 370. Where such cause of action, set-off, counter-claim, or 
cross-demand, as should be evidenced by writing, is so evidenced,
then the same must be stated to be so, and the writing, or a copy
thereot, must be annexed to the pleading, else it shall not be re­
ceived in proof on trial. 
Sec. 371. All statements which need not be proved to any ex­
tent at all, such as the statement of time, quantity, quality, and
value, when these are immaterial, the statement of :finding and
losing, and bailment in action for goods, or their value ; · the state­
ment of promises which were not in fact made, and which need
not be proved, and all statements of a like kind, shall be omitted. 
Sec. 372. If a party state more facts, or a greater title or estate
than is necessary to entitle him to the relief claimed, and such
facts, estates, or title be denied to the full extent, he shall not be 
compelled to proTe more than is necessary to constitute a claim to
the relief prayed, or t• a.ny lower degree of relief, included in the
relief prayed. And if a party states in his answer or teply, more
than is needed for his defence, he shall not be compelled to prove
more than is needed for his defence. 
Sec. 878. When the action, defence, set-off, counter-claim or
cross-demand is founded on a written instrument, and the original
is referred to in a pleading, and annexed thereto, the genuineness
and due execution of sneh inatrument shall be deemed admitted,
unless the adverse party in response to such pleading, if it is one
which may be responded to, and if it be not, then before the trial
deny the genuineness of execution of' the same by affidavit; and 
when any other writing, purporting to have been executed. by one
of the parties is referred to in, and filed with a pleading, it may
be read against such party as genuine and duly executed, unless
he denies the same by affidavit, before the trial is begun. 
Sec. 874. Either party may be allowed, on motion, to make
a supplemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts materal to
the case, which have happened or have come to his knowledge 
since the filing of the former petition, answer, or reply, nor shall

Sec. 875. Matter in abatement may be stated in the answer or

same action to answer er reply matter in bar. 
Sec. 376. Any defence arising after the commencement of any
action, shall be stated according to the fact, without any formal
commencement or conclusion, and any answer which does not
state whether the defence therein set up arose before or after ac­
tion, shall be deemed to be of matter arising before 'action. 
Sec. 377. The forms contained in Schedule A. to this act an­
nexed shall be sufficient, and those and the like forms may be used 
with such modifications as may be necessary to meet the facts of
the case ; but nothing herein contained shall render it erroneous
or irregular to depart from the letter of such forms so long as-the
substance is expressed without prolixity. 
Sec. 378. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof is to be deemed 1naterial, unless it has actually mis­
led the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or
defence upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has
been so misled, that fact must be shown by proof aliunde to the
satisfaction of the Court, and such proof must also show in what
respect he has been so misled, and thereupon the Court may order
the pleading to be amended upon such terms as may be iust. 
Sec. 379. When the variance .s not material as provided in the
· last section, the Court may direct the fact to be found according 
to the. evidence, and may order an immediate amendment without
costs. 
Sec. 380. When, however, the allegation of the claim or de­
fence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some par- 
· ticular or particulars only, but in its general scope and meaning,
it shall not be deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure ot proof.
Sec. 381. The plaintiff may amend his petition without leave, 
at any time before the answer is filed, without prejudice to the
proceedings already had; but a copy of such amendment shall be ·
served on the defendant or his attorney, and the defendant shall
have the same time to answer or demur thereto as he had to the
original petition. 
Sec. 382. Upon a demurrer being overruled, the party demur­
ring may answer or reply. 
Sec. 383. The Court may at any time in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleadings or pro­
ceedings by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting & mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case,
or when the amendment does not change substantially. the claim
or defence by conforming the pleadings or proceedings to the facts
proved. The Court may likewise in its discretion, on terms, and
for good cause proved, allow an answer or reply to be filed after
the time limited by this Code, when such time has not been by
order extended. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party,
fails, in any respect to conform to the provisions of this Code, it
may permit an amendment of such proceeding so as to make it 
conformable thereto.
Sec. 384. The Court must in every stage of an action, disre­ 
gard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect
the substantial rigats of the adverse party \ and no judgment shall 
be reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.
Sec. 385. When either party shall amend any pleading or pro­ 
ceeding, the case shall not be continued in consequence thereof,
unless the Court shall be satisfied by affida,'it or otherwise, that
the adverse party could not be ready for trial in consequence of
such amendment. But if the Court is thus made to become satisfied
a continuance may be granted to some day in the same term, or to.
the next term of said Court. 
Sec. 386. Whenever two or more actions are pending in the 
same court which might have been joined, the defendant may, on 
motion, and notice to the adverse party, require him to show cause 
why the same shall not be consolidated, and if no sufficient came
be shown, the same shall be consolidated. 
Sec. 387. Courts may permit the amendments authorized by
this chapter to be made, without being verified as prescribed in section 811, unless a new and distinct cause ot action, defence,
set-off, counter-claim or eross-demand is there by introduced. 
Sec. 388. If an original pleading be lost or withheld by any
one, the Oourt may order a copy thereof to be substituted. 
Sec. 389. All matters of supplement or amendment, whether
of addition or subtraction, shall be made not by erasure or inter­
lineation of the original, or by addition thereto, but upon a sepa­
rate paper, which shall be filed, and shall constitute, with the orig­
inal, but one pleading. But if it be stated in such paper that it is
a ·substitute for the former pleading intended to be amended, in
that case, it shall be deemed such substitute, but the pleading su­
perseded by the substitute, shall not be withdrawn from the files. 
Sec. 390. No process, pleading or record shall be amended or
impaired by the Clerk or other officer ot the Court, or by any person
without the order of .such Court, or of some Court of competent
authority.

reply, written interrogatories to any one or more of the adverse
parties concerning any of the material matters in issue in the ae
tion, the answer to which on oath may be read by either party as
a deposition between the 'Party interrogating and the party an­
swering. 
Sec. 392. The par~ answering shall not be confined to re­
sponding merely to the interrogatories, but may state any new
matter concerning the same cause of action which shall likewise 
be read as a deposition.
Sec. 893. These shall be answered at the same time the peti - 
tion is required to be answered; and when annexed to the answer
or reply, shall be answered at or before the calling of the cause for
trial, if such pleading has been filed "four" clear days. ' 
Sec. 394. The trial of an action by ordinary proceedings, shall
not be postponed on account of the failure to answer interrogato­
ries, if the party interrogated is present in court at the trial, so
that he may be orally examined; nor, in case of his absence, un- 
less an affidavit be filed showing the facts, the party believes will
be proved by the answers thereto, and that the party has not filed
the interrogatories for the purpose of delay ; whereupon, if the 
party will consent that the facts stated in the afflda,-it shall be con­
sidered as admitted by those interrogated, the · trial sball not be
postponed for that cause. 
Sec. 395. The party in answering nch interrogatories, shall
distinguish clearly between what is stated from his personal knowl­
edge, and what is stated from information or belief merely. An
unqualified statement of a fact shall be considered as made of hie
personal knowledge. 
Sec. 896. The answers to the interrogatories shall be verified
by the affidavit of the party answering, to the effect that the st&te­
mente in them made of his own personal knowledge a~ true, and
those made from the information of others, he believes to be true.

a.n affidavit that he verily believes the subject of the interrogato­
ries, or any of them, ie in the personal knowledge of the opposite
party, and tbat his answers thereto, if trulj' made from such
knowledge, will sustain the claim or defence, or any .part thereof,
and the opposite party shall fail to answer therein within the time
allowed therefor, or by the court extended the claim or defence, or
the part thereof, according to sueh affidavit, shall be deemed to De 
sustained, judgment given accordingly.

Sec. 391. Issues arise in the pleadings where a fact or conclu­
sion of law is maintained by one party and controverted by the
other. They are of two kinds; let, of Law-2d, of Fact. 
Sec. 392. An issue of faot arises, 1st-Upon a material allega­
tion of factIn the petition denied by the answer. 2d-Upon a 
material allegation of fact in a set-off, counter-claim or cross-de- 
mand, presented in the answer and denied by the reply. 8d­
U pon allegations of fact being new matter, in the answer or reply,
which shall be considered as controverted by the opposite . party
without furthe:r pleading. 
SEC. 893. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the peti­
tion, answer, or reply, or to some part of either, or upon any alle­
gation of fact in a pleading by the one party, the truth of :which is
neither controverted by the other party, nor by the law for him. 
Sec. 894. Issues both of law and fact may arise upon different
parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases the issues
of law must be first tried; but by going to trial on an issue of
fact without objection, a party will be deemed to have waived his
demurrer. 
Sec. 895. A trial is a judicial examination of the issues in an
action, whether they be issuee of law or of fact. 
Sec. 396. Issues ef law must be tried by the Court unless re­
terred as provided in section 4:87. An Issue of fact in an action
by ordinary proceedings, must be tried by a jury, unless a jury

ordered, as provided in section 488. 
Sec. 397. Equitable issues may be tried according to two dis­
tinct methods, called, first and secondly, methods of equitable tri­
als, and these methods shall differ one from the other in the fol­
lowing partiealars, and none others : 
First-As to the form of evidence. In all cases tried according 
to the first method, all the evidence shall be in writing ; while in
those cases tried by the second method, the evidence shall be as in
ordinary actions. 
Second-As to who may determine the tacts therein. In a trial 
by the first method, the issues shall be tried by the Court, who
may, however, to inform his conscience, order the whole issue or
any part thereof or any specific question of fact involved therein
to be tried by a jury, or may refer the same, and may in either
case accept or reject the finding of the jury or referee, and may
with or without a statement of any finding of facts, render such
judgment as he considers equitable. 
While in a trial by the second method, either party shall be en­
titled to have the whole issue or any part thereof, or any specific
question of fact involved therein, tried by a jury under the in­
structions of the Court, as in a case by ordinary proceedings, or 
to have the same tried by the Court acting as a jury, 'and finding
in writing the facts, which finding of facts in either case shall be
of ultimate facts and not of evidence of such facts, and shall be
stated on the record as a special verdict, and the judgment of the
Court shall be ;he legal conclusions based upon and supported by
the facts so found as herein contemplated. 
Third-As to what is triable on appeal. In an appeal taken on a 
case tried in the first method, all the evidence shall go to the Su­
preme Court, which shall try the case Oil both the law and facts
as apparent of record. 
While in cases tried by the second method, no evidence shall,
on appeal, go to the Supreme Court, and such court shall try only
the legal errors thereof, duly presented, as in a case by ordinary
proceedings, including the sufficiency of the facts statea on the
record, as the basis of' the judgment to warrant the same. 
Sec. 398. The first method shall obtain in all cases, except, let
-In divorce cases. id-In foreclosure of tax-title cases, - and of 
mortgages. 8d-ln default cases. ith-In cases where all the 
parties thereto consent to try by the second method, in which ca­ 
ses the second method shall obtain.
SEC. 399. The consent in the last section contemplated, must 
be expressed in open court, and entered of record, or must be in
writing and signed by the parties or the attorney of the parties,
and filed in the cause. 
Sec. 400. The plaintifl' in his petition, or the defendant in his
answer, may atate his coasent to try the case by the second method,
and if the other party, within ten days thereafter, filed his con­
sent thereto in t~e Clerk's Office, the cause shall be so tried. 
Sec. 401. Or if all the parties at any time before trial enter
into such consent, the cause shall be so tried. 
Sec. 402. A civil cause shall not be tried save by consent ot
the bar, in any other order than that in which it stands upon the
docket. 
Sec. 408. The clerk shall keep a calendar of all the causes
pending in his court-arranging in one part thereof, criminal
causes, in the order of their_ commencement-in another part
thereof, ordinary actions, in the same order-and in another,
equitable actions, in the same order-and shall enter the causes
thereen as soon as the same are commenced, by the filing of the
petition or transcript therein, and shall, under the direction of the 
Court or judge, apportioa the same to as many days of the term,
as shall be thought necessary, and shall on the order of any party,
in any cause, issue subpoenas for witnesses· returnable on the -
day on which such cause is set for trial, and the clerk shall fur­
nish at such term, the Court and the bar; each, with a copy of
such calendar. 
Sec. 404. The criminal causes shall first be called in their
order, and disposed of by trial, or continuance, in such order, and
after the civil calendar is entered upon, no criminal cause shall be
allowed to intervene. But the Court shall not protract the trial of
the civil causes beyond a day of the term· after which all defend­
ants in criminal causes who desire to be tried at such term, m~y be
so tried-during which re-entry upon the criminal calendar, the
causes shall be tried, or continued, in their order. 
Sec. 405. Except when otherwise provided, causes shall be
tried at the first term after due legal and timely service has been
made, unless reasonable cause for a continuance be shown, 
Sec. 406. When time is asked for making application tor a con­
tinuance, the cause shall not lose its place on the calendar, or it 
may be continued at the option of the other pa.rty, and at the cost
of the party applying therefor-for which eest judgment may at
once be entered by the Clerk, unless the contrary be ~reed be­
tween the parties. 
Sec. 407. A continuance shall not be granted for any cause
growing out of the fault or negligence of the party applying there­
for; subject to this rule, it may be allowed for any cause whieh
satisfies the Court that su\,stantial justice will thereby be more
nearly obtained. , 
SEC. 408. Motions for continuance on account of the absence of
evidence, must be founded on the· affidavit of the party, hia agent,
or Attorney, stating facts as distinguished from legal conclusions
which show the materiality of the evidence sought to be obtained,
and showing that efforts which constitute due diligence have been
used to obtain its presence. 
Sec. 409. If such motion 'be on accouu.t of the absence of a wit·
ness, the affidavit so sworn to, as in the last section, must state,
lst.-The name and residence of such witness, or if that be not 
known, a sufficient reason why not known, and also, in either case,
facts showing reasonable ground of belief that hia attendance or 
testimony will be procured at the next term. 2d~It must atso 
state efforts constituting due diligence which have been used to
obtain such witness or his testimony. 8d-It must also state what
particular facts, as distinguished from legal conclusions, the afflant
believes the witness will proTe, and that the atliant believes them
to be true, and that . he knows of no other witness by whom such
facts can be fully proved. 
Sec. 410. If the affidavit does not contain a sufficient statement 
of the facts herein required, the Oourt shall overrule the same, as
insufficient in statement of facts. 
Sec. 411. It on the oontrary, the Oourt finda the statement euf­
fieient, it shall so determine, and the cause shall be continued,
unless the opposite party will admit that t~ witness, if present,
would swear to the facts thus stated, in which event the cause shall
not be continued, but the party moving therefor shall read as the
evidence _of such witness, the facts by the Court held to be suffi­
ciently stated. 
Sec. 412. The motion must be filed on the first day of the term,
if it is then certain that it will have to be made before the trial,
and as soon thereafter as it becomes certain that it will so need to 
be made, and shall not be allowed to be made when the cause is 
called for trial, except for cause which could not, by reasaonble
diligence, have been before that time discovered; and if made after
the first day of the term, the affidavit must state facts eonstituting 
an· excuse for the delay in making it. If time is taken- when the
case is called to make such motion, the motion shall be made and

detendants may continue 88 to himself.

First-For such a bias as, when the existence of the fact is ascer­
tained, in judgment of law disqualifies the juror, and which is
known in this Chapter as implied bias. 
Second-For the existence of a state of mind on the part of the
jnrer in. reference to the case, which, in the exercise of a souad dis- 
cretion, leads to the inference that he will not act wit;h entire im-
partiality, and which is actual bias. -

any of the following causes, and for no other :
Firat-Consanguinity of affinity within the ninth degree, to the

deficiency, from the body of the county. 
Sec. 443. The parties may, at any time, either before the jury
is sworn, or after, agree to take the verdict of the majority, which
agreement being stated to the Oonrt and stated on the record to
have been made, shall bind the parties, and in such case a verdict
signed by any seven or more and duly rendered, when read and
not disapproved by said majority, shall, in every particular, be e.s
binding as as if made by a full jury ; or

tended to be applied. 
Sec. 447. If the Oourt refuse a written inatrnction,~ demaad­
ed, but give the same with a modification which the Court may do

call for argument ; when settled they must all be read· over by the
Court to the jury, and announced as given or refused, by ·th~

may be without any stated reason therefor, and all instructions
demanded must be filed, and shall become part of the record. 
Sec. 450. Any decision or instruction of the Court in favor of
either party, may be abandoned by such party at any time before
the case is committed to the jury, unless testimony calculated to

position which he would have occupied had such decision or. in­ 
struction not been given.
Sec. 451. The parties then may either submit or argue the 
case to the jury. In the argument the party having the burthen 
of the issue, shall have the opening and closing, but shall disclose 
in the opening all the points relied on in the cause ; and if in the

charge of an officer, to the place, which shall be shown to them by
some person appointed by the Court for that purpose ; while the
jury are thus absent, no person other than the person so appointed 
shall speak to them on any subject connected with the trial.

verdict agreed upon.
Sec. 461. If, after the empannelling of the jury and before 
verdict, a juror becomes sick so as to be unable to perform his
duty, he may be discharged. In such case, unless otherwise ar-

be filled, and' the trial commence anew, or the Court may, in its 
discretion, order the jury to be discharged.
Sec. 462. Th~ jury may be discharged by the Court on ac­ 
count of any accident or calamity requiring their discharge, or by
the consent of both parties, or when on an amendment a continu­
ance is ordered, or after they have been kept together until it sat­

Sec. 463. In all cases where the jnry are discharged, during
the trial or after the cause is submitted to them, it may be tried
again i:rnmediately, or at a future time, as the Court may then di­

Sec. 464. The Court may also, at any time after having en­
tered npon the trial of any cause, where it may deem it right for

give further testimony to correct an evident oversight or mistake,
but terms may be imposed upon the party obtaining the privilege.

desire to be informed as to any point of law arising in the case,
they may request the officer to conduct them into Court, which
he sltall do, when the information required shall be given, in the
presence of, or after notice to the parties or their counsel. 
Sec. 469. Such information shall be in writing, if so demanded
by either party, and shall be held approved, unless it be excepted
to in the same way as the charge, and no discussion thereon shall
be allowed to either party. 
Sec. 470. The verdict must be written and signed by a fore- 
man chosen by the jury itself, and when agreed the jury must be
conducted into Court, their names called, and the verdict rendered 
by him, and read by the clerk to the jury and the inquiry made
whether it ia their verdict. If any juror disagrees, the jury must
be sent out agaiin, but if no disagreement is expressed and neither
party requires the jury to be polled, the verdict is complete and
the jury discharged frem the case. · 
Sec. 471. When the verdict is announced, either party may
require the jury to be polled, which shall be done by the Court or
clerk, asking each juror if it is his verdict. If any one answer in
the negative, the jury must be sent out for further deliberation. 
Sec. 472. When by consent of the parties and the Court, the
jury have been permitted to seal their verdict and separate before 
it is rendered, such sealing is equivalent to a rendition and a re­
cording thereof in open Court, nor shall such jury be polled or
permitted to disagree thereto, unless such a course has been agreed 
upon between the parties in open Court and entered on the record.

A general verdict is one in which they pronounce generally for 
the plaintiff or for the defendant upon all or upon any of the is­
sues. 
Sec. 475. A special verdict is one in which the jury finds facts
only, it must present the ultimate facts as established by the evi­
dence, and not the evidence to prove them so that nothing remains
to the Court but to draw from them its conclusions of law. 
Sec. 476. In all actions, the jury, in their discretion, may ren­
der a general or a special verdict, and in any case in which they
render a general verdict, they may be required by the Court, and

find specially upon particular questions of fact to be stated to them
in writing, or to find that the fact stated in the petition, answer, or
reply, or in all or either of them, or in any count of either of them,
or in ease any count of either of them be divisible, then that any
defined part thereof, is true, or not true, and such special finding
is to be recorded with the verdict. 
Sec. 477. When the special finding of facts is inconsistent with
the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and the Oourt
may give judgment accordingly. 
Sec. 478. When by the verdict either party is entitled to re­
cover money of the adverse party, the jury in their verdict must
assess the amount of such recovery. 
Sec. 479. In actions for the recovery of specific personal prop·
erty, the jury must assess the value of the property, as also the
damages for taking or detention, whenever, by their verdict there
will be a judgment for the recovery or return of the property, and
when required so to do by either party, must find the value of
each article thereof. 
Sec. 480. In all suite comprising different causes of action, or
one cause of action, divisible into different parts, where a separate
thing, sum of money, or amount of damages is claimed for each
cause of action or each part thereof, and where any defeneevor
any opinion or instruction of' the Court may affect but one or more 
thing, cause of action, or part thereof, without affecting the rest,
the Oourt may, and on the request of either party, must direct the
jury to separate in their verdict, their finding upon each separate
defence or thing, or each separate cause of action, or each separate
part of the same cause of action, so as to make it possible for an~ 
appeal to be taken on one part of the case without disturbing any
other part.

Sec. 484. Upon a decision ot a demurrer if the unsuccessful
party fail to amend or plead over the same consequences shall
ensue as though a verdict had passed against the plaintiff, or the
defendant had made default, as the case may be. 
Sec. 485. Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties,
to an issue of fact, in the following cases : 
1st. By suffering default or by failing to appear at the trial.
2d. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the 
clerk.
8d. By oral consent in open Court, entered in the minutes.
SEC. 486. Upon the trial of questions of fact, by the Court, in 
an action by ordinary proceedings, it shall not be necessary for
the Court to state its finding, except generally for the plaintiff or
defendant, unless one of the parties, before any testimony is offer­
ed, requests it, in which case its decision shall be given in writing,
stating the facts found, and the legal conclusions founded thereon,
separately, all of which shall be entered on tlte record. 
Sec. 487. All or any of the issues in an action, whether of fact
or of law, or both, may be referred, upon the consent of the par­ 
ties, either written or oral, in Court, entered upon the reeerd.

upon the motion of either, or upon its own motion, direct a refer-
ence in either of the following cases : .

ation of mutual accounts, or when the account being on one side
only, it shall be made to appear to the Court that it is necessary

Sec. 491. The referees shall stand in the place of the Court, 
and shall have the same power, so far as necessary, to discharge
their duty. 
Sec. 492. The trial by referees shall be conducted in the same
manner as a trial by the Court. They have the same power to
summon and enforce, by attachment, the attendance of witnesses,
to punish them as for a contempt for non-attendance, or refusal to
be sworn, or to testify, and to administer all necessary oaths in the
trial of the case, to take testimony by commission, grant continu­
ances, to preserve order, and punish all violationa thereof. 
Sec. 493. The report of the referees on the whole issue, must
state the facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately, and 
shall stand as the finding of the Court, except as otherwise provid­

be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been
tried by the Court- the report may be excepted to and reviewed
in like manner.

Sec. 496. In all cases of reference, the parties, except when an
infant may be a party, may agree upon a suitable person or per­ 
sons, not exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered ac­
cordingly; and if the parties do not agree, the Court shall appoint
one or more referees, not exceeding three, who shall be persons 
free from exception, and having the qualification of jurors, or the
Court may allow each party to select one, and itself select a third. 
Sec. 497. A judge of the Court, when a case is pending, may,
in vacation, upon the written consent of the parties, make an order
of reference. In such case the order of reference shall be written
in the written agreement to refer, and shall be filed with the clerk
of the Court, with tho other papers in the case. 
Sec. 498. The referees must make an affidavit well and faith­
fully to hear and examine the case, and to make a just and true 
· report therein according to the best of their understanding. The 
oath may be administered by any person authorized to administer

reference. The order may direct when the referee shall proceed
to a hearing, and when he shall make his report ; but in the ab­

day after the day on which was made the order of reference, and
shall file his report as soon as done ; of the time thus fixed, or de­
termined, the parties shall take notice, and non-attendance of eith­ 
er party within an hour of such time, shall be attended with like
consequences as if the case were in Court, which consequence

Sec. 501. The referee must be called on by the Court to accept
or refuse the appointment, and his acceptance shall be entered of
record ; and he shall be under the control of tho Court, who may,

to his proceeding with all due dispatch, and the Court or Judge
may, on his motion, on good cause shown, enlarge the time of
making his report. 
Sec. 502. Any one of such referees may issue and sign sub­
peenas, and other process, administer oaths, necessary for the dis­

regulates service, pleading, proof, trial, and the preparation, pro­
gression, and method of each of these shall obtain before the re­
feree, and in every incident of the proceeding before him the rights
and responsibilities of parties, and of their attornies, and of the
reteree, shall be the same as if the referee was the Court, engaged
in the same matter. 
Sec. 504. An exception is an objection taken to a decision of
the Court, or party acting as the Court, on matter of law. The
party objecting to the decision, must object at the time the deci­
sion is made, and at once present his bill of exceptions; but un- 
less the Oourt or adverse party object, he may have time to do so,
not extending beyond the term. 
Sec. 505. No stated form of exception is required. So much
of the evidence as is neeessary to explain the ruling, should be
stated, and the ruling, and that it was excepted to when made,
unless that fact otherwise appear. If the exception is to the ad­
mission or exclusion of evidence, oral or written, the ground of
the objection must be also stated, and no other shall be regarded. 
Sec. 506. When the decision objected to is entered on the re­
cord, and the grounds of the exception appear in the entry, or
when any error appears of record, the exception may be taken by
the party causing to be noted at the end of the decision, or in con­
nection therewith, that he excepts. 
Sec. 507. Where an instruction is marked, excepted to, such
terms shall sufficiently indicate that it was excepted to at the pro­
per time, and an exception when presented for signature, need
not include therein, spread out at length, any writing filed in
Court, but may incorporate the same, by any unmistakable refer­
ence thereto, and the clerk in making a transcript of the bill of
exception shall write therein at length, all of such writing includ­ 
ed therein by reference.
Sec. 508. When the decision is not entered on the record, or 
when the grounds of objection do not sufficiently appear in the 
record, the party excepting must reduce his exception to writing, 
and present it to the Oourt for its signature. If the judge deems
it true he shall sign It. If he does not deem it true, he shall at 
once state to the party offering it, what cerreetion he desires to
make thereto, if the party accept the same, or if he and the judge 
elm agree upon any correction, the judge shall, having made the
same, sign snch exception, and it shall be filed and become part of 
the record. But it the judge and the party cannot agree on such
exception, the party shall announce the same to the judge, who
shall thereupon deliver the exception back to the party. The
party may then proceed to procure the signatures of two or more
by-standers to the exception, and the Court shall allow him area­
sonable time therefor, and shall in no manner interfere with his
endeavor to do so. If the party procure the signature of two by­ 
standers, attesting that the exception is true, and that the Court
has refused to sign the same, the exception shall be filed by the
clerk and shall become part of the record. The truth of such ex- 
ception may be controverted and maintained by affidavits not ex­
ceeding five in number, and all affidavits impugning the exception
shall be filed with the clerk on the morning of the first day after
that on which the exception was filed, and those sustaining it on
the next morning thereafter. Such affidavits shall also become
part of the record, and the Supreme Oourt shall, on becoming
satisfied that any exception is true, consider the same. 
Sec. 509. No exception shall be regarded in the Supreme
Court, unless the ruling has been on a material point, and the
effect thereof prejudicial to the substantive rights of the party ex­ 
cepting. 
Sec. 510. A new trial is a re-examination in the same Court of 
an fssue of fact, after a verdict by a [ury, report of a referee, or a
decision by the Cou t. The former report, verdict or decision,
shall be vacated, and a new trial granted, on the applies .ion of the
party aggrieve , for any ot the following~uees affecting material­
ly the substantial rights of such party : 
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the Oourt, jury, referee, or
prevailing party, or any order ot Oourt or referee, or abuse of dis­ 
cretion, by which the party was prevented from having a fair trial. 
2. Misconduct of the jury o'r prevailing party. 
3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not
have guarded againet. 
4. Excessive damages, appearing to have been given under the
influence of passion or of prejudice. 
5. Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery, whether
too large or too small, where the action is upon a contract or for
the injury or detention of property. 
6. That the verdict, report or decision, is not su&ta.ined by suffi­
cient evidence, or is contrary to law. 
6. Newly discovered evidence material for the party applying,
which he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and
produced at the trial. 
8. Error of law occurring at the trial, excepted to by the party
making the application. 
Sec. 511. A new trial shall not be granted on seeennt of the
smallness of damages in an action for an injury to the person or 
reputation, nor in any other action where the damages shall equal
the actual pecuniary injury sustained. 
Sec. 512. The application for a new trial must be made at the
term the verdict, report or decision is rendered, and except for the
cause of newly discovered evidence material for the party apply­
ing, which he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered
and produced at the trial, shall be within _three days after the ver­ 
dict or decision was rendered.
Sec. 513. The application must be made by motion upon writ­ 
ten grounds filed at the time of making the motion, the causes
enumerated iu sub-divisions two, three and seven, of section 510,
must be sustained by affidavits showing their truth, and may be 
controverted by affidavits.
Sec. 514. Where the grounds for a new trial could not, w.th 
reasonable diligence, have been discovered before, bot are discov­
ered after the term at which the verdict, repor~f referee or deci­
sion was rendered or made, the application may be made by petition
filed as in other cases, not later than the second term after the
discovery ; on which notice shall be served and returned as an
original notice, and the defendant held to appear as in an original
action. The facts stated in the petition shall be considered as de­
nied, without answer. The ·case shall be tried as other cases, by
ordinary proceedings, but no petition shall be filed more than sne
year after the final judgment was rendered. 
Sec. 515. The costs of all new trials shall either abide the event
of' the snit, or be paid by the party to whom such new trial is
granted, according to the order of the Court to be made at the 
time of granting such new trial.
Sec. 516. The Court may determine not to grant a new trial, 
unless certain terms or conditions named by the Court shall be
agreed to by the opposite party; in the event of his agreement to
which, the terms or conditions named shall be entered on the
record, and no new trial shall be granted it the party refuse to agree
to the terms or conditions upon which a new trial shall be awarded. 
Sec. 517. In case a new trial is granted, judgment shall never­
theless be entered upon the first verdict, if the party claiming it so
demand, and shall stand until the second verdict is rendered, and 
judgment rendered thereon, when the first verdict and judgment
shall be set aside, but no execution shall issue on such judgment
afler an entry allowing a new trial. 
Sec. 518. Upon any motion made tor a new trial, or for judg­
ment, notwithstanding the verdict, by reason of the non-averment
of some material fact, the party whose pleading is thus alleged de­
fective, may, if the Court deem it necessary, :file a statement of the
omitted tact, which if true, would remedy the alleged defects, and
such statement shall be filed before the hearing of the motion, and
shall suspend the same. It the facts thus stated would not, if 
proved, defeat the object of the motion, it shall be granted. If
such new averments would, if proved, defeat the object of the mo­
tion, be not admitted, they must be denied or confessed, and avoid­
ed by the opposite party, within such time as the Court shall direct,
unless the same are denied by legal operation, and in such case
the law of pleading and of procedure applicable to actions and
pleadings of that kind shall obtain ; except that the party stating
the new fact shall be held the plaintiff therein, and the statement
and response shall not need to be verified. 
Sec. 519. If the facts thus stated be admitted, or · found to be
true, the party stating the same shall be entitled to such judgment 
as he would have been entitled to it such facts had been stated in
the original pleading, and admitted as proved in the trial, together
with the costs of, and occasioned by the new pleading and the pro­
ceedings therein ; but if the fact be found untrue, the opposite party
shall be entitled to his costs of, and occasioned by the new pleading
and the proceedings thereon, in addition to any other costs to which 
he may be entitled. 
Sec. 520. Every final adjudication of the rights of the parties
in an action, is a judgment; and such adjudication may contists of
many judgments, one of which judgments may determine for the 
plaintiff or defendant on the claim of either as an entirety, or when 
.a claim consists of several parts or items, such judgment may be
for either of them, on any specific proof or item of such aggregate 
claim, and against him on the other part thereof, or a judgment
may in either of these ways determine on the claims of co-parties
on the same side against each other. 
Sec. 521. To avoid a re-examination of questions and issues
which have been once satisfactorily settled, and a re-opening of
such parts of a cause as have been satisfactorily tried, any party 
who succeeds in part of his cause, or in part of his caases, and fails as
to part, may have the entry in such case express judgment forhim
for such part as he succeeds upon, and against him on the other
part. 
Sec. 522. Judgment may be rendered for or against one or
more of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several
defendants, whether snch plaintiffs or defendants be jointly or sev­ 
ally liable, and the Oourt may determine the ultimate rights of the
parties, on the same side as between themselves, and may grant to
any party any affirmative relief which he may be entitled to, and
render judgment accordingly, and may render sneh and so many 
judgments, joint, separate and cross, as may be necessary to express
the rights of the parties. ' 
Sec. 523. Where matter in abatement, is plead in connection
with other matter not such, the finding of the jury or Court must
distinguish between matter in abatement and matter in bar, and
the judgment must, it it is rendered on the matter in abatement,
and not on the merits, so declare. 
Sec. 524. Where any other than a general execution of the
common form is required, the party must state in his pleading the
faets entitling him thereto, and the judgment may be entered in
accordance with the finding of the Court or jury thereon. 
Sec. 626. In an action against several defendants, the Court
may, in its discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, 
whenever a several judgment is proper, leaving the action to pro­
ceed against the others. 
Sec. 526. An action ma.y be dismissed, and such dismissal shall
be without prejudice to a future action : 
1st-By the plaintiff' before the final submission of the case to
the jnry or to the Court, when the trial is by the Cottrt. 
2d-By the Court, when the plaintiff fails to appear when the 
case is called for trial.
3d-By the Oourt, for want of neooasary parties, when not made 
according to the requirement of the Oourt,
,th-By the Court, on the application of some of the defendants,

diligence.

decision must be upon the merits. 
Sec. 528. In any case when a set-oft~ counter-claim or cross­

against such party therefor, in favor of the party entitled thereto,
and issue execution therefor at the order ot such party ; the party
so dismissing shall be liable for no costs made by the other party 
atter notice to him of such dismissal.
Sec. 581. Though all the defendants have been served with 
notice, judgment may be rendered against any of them severally,
where the plaintiff would be entitled to judgments against such
defendants, if the action had been against such alone. 
Sec. 532. The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no
answer, cannot exceed that which ~he shall have demanded in his
petition. But in any other case the Court may grant him any re­
lief conaistent with the case made by the petition and embraced
within the issue. 
SEC. 583. Whenever damages are recoverable, the party may
claim and recover if he shows himself entitled thereto, any amount
of damages which he might have hitherto recovered for the same
stated cause of action.

pleading, judgment may, at any time, be rendered for the part not

the Oourt has ordered the case to be reserved, it shall order what
judgment shall be entered. 
Sec. 537. When by the statements or the pleadings, one party

into the facts attending or connected with the assignment of a 
judgment, or the entry of the same to the use of any party, and

time prescribed by the rules of pleading, or in the absence of
rules by the time fixed by the Court-or if having plead, his an­
swer, or reply, on motion or demurrer is held insufficient or is
struck out, and he fail to amend or to answer or reply further as

ceeding term.

When 1ong accounts are to be examined, the Court may refer

CHAPTER XVIII. 
ATT AOHMENT AND GARITISHl(ENT. 
Sec. 571. The plaintiff in a civil action may cause any prop·
erty of the defendant which is not exempt from execution, to be
attached at the commeacement or during the progress of the pro­
ceeding, by pursuing the course hereinafter prescribed. 
Sec. 572. If it be subsequent to the commencement of the ac­
tion, a separate petition must be filed, and in all cases the pro­
ceedings relative to the attachment are to be deemed independent
of the ordinary proceedings and only auxiliary thereto. 
Sec. 578. The petition which asks an attachment must, in all
cases, be sworn to. It must state 1st-That the defendant is a
foreign corporation, or acting as such, or 2d-That he is a non­
resident of the State, or 3d-That he is in some manner about to
dispose of or remove his property out of the State, without leav­
ing sufficient remaining for the payment of his debts, or 4th-That
he has disposed of his property (in whole or in part) with intent
to defraud his creditors, or 5th-That he has absconded, so that
the ordinary pre>cess cannot be served upon him, or 6th-That he
is about to remove permanently out of the county, and bas prop­
erty therein not exempt from execution, with which he refuses to
pay or to secure the debt due to the plaintiff residing in such
county, or 7th-That he is about to remove permanently out of the 
State and refuses to pay or secure the debt of the plaintiff.
Sec. 574. If the plaintiff's demand is founded on contract, the 
petition must state that something is due, and as near as practica­
ble, the amount, which mnst be more then five dollars in order to
authorize an attachment. 
Sec. 575. The amount thus sworn to is intended as a guide to
the sheriff, who must, as nearly as the circumstances of the case
will permit, levy upon property fifty per cent greater in value than
that amount. 
Sec. 576. If the demand is not founded on contract, the origi­
nal petition must be presented to some judge of the Supreme or
District Court, or the judge of the County Court, who shall make 
an allowance thereon of the amount in value of the property that
may be attached. The provisions of this section apply only to 
cases in the District Court.
Sec. 577. The property of a debtor may be attached previous 
to the time when the debt becomes due, when nothing but time is
wanting to fix an absolute indebtedness and when the petitio• in 
addition to that fact states, let-That the defendant is about to
dispose of his property with intent to defraud his creditors, or 2d­
That he is about to remove from the State, and retnses to make
any arrangements for securing the payment of the debt when it
falls due, and which contemplated removal was not known to the
plaintiff' at the time the debt was contracted. 
Sec. 578. It the debt or demand on which the attachment snit
is brought, is not due, at the time of the service of the attachment,
the defendant is not required to file any pleadinp until the matu- · 
rity of such debt or demand; but he may, in his discretion, do so,
and go to trial as early as the cause is reached. 
Sec. 579. And no final judgment shall be rendered upon such
attachment, unless the party consents, as in the last . section, until
the debt or demaad upon which it is based, becomes due. But
property of a perishable nature, may be sold as in other attach­ 
ment cases.
Sec. 580. Before any attachment can be issued as aforesaid, 
the plaintiff must file with the clerk, a bond, for the use of the de­
fendant, with sureties to be approved by the clerk, in a penalty at
least double the value of the property sought to be attached, and
in no case less than two hundred and fifty dollars, in the District
Oonrt, nor less than fifty dollars, if in a Justices' Court, con -
ditioned that the plaintiff will pay all damages, which the defend­
ant may sustain, by reason of the wrongful suing out of the at­ 
tachment. ·
Sec. 581. The defendant may, at any time, before judgment, 
move the Court for additional security on the part of the plaintiff,
and if, on such motion, the Court is satisfied that the surety in
the plaintiff's bond has removed from this State, or is not suffi­
cient, it may vacate the writ of attachment, and direct restitution
of any property taken under it, unless in a reasonable time, to be
fixed by the Court, and within two clear days thereafter, sufficient
security is given by the plaintiff. , 
Sec. 582. In an action in such bond the plaintiff therein may
recover, if he shows that the attachment was wrongfully sued.out, 
&lll~: damag~s as he has thereby suffered, and if sued out mali­
ciously as well as wrongfully, the jury may, on such trial, give
.vindietiired4Jnages,,in·their. diaeretion, nor need he wait until the
pri.Mipal, ,lluit &s: determined before he, bring .suit on the bond .
SEC. 583.  Where suits are properly commenced ia the .District
.Oourt .. ot any.C:OU.nty,: tha:augiliary pto.cess of ,attachment may;rnn
at th~. B!Pl).e: time iato av.y: other .eounty. where property of the, de­
fendant: can be found, and. several of them may, at the: opticn.of
the plaintiff, be, issued .at, the. same time or in. suceession and sub­
setu.ently, but only those .. executed shall be taaed in 'the costs, a.rul

only. 
Sec. 615. The Court before whom the action is pending, or

this chapter, and to collect, manage and control the same, and pay
over the proceeds according to the nature of the property and ex­ 
igency of the case.

any attached property is found, or any person making affidavit that
he has an interest in it, may, at any time before judgement, dis­
charge the property attached, or any part thereof, by giving bond
with security, to be approved by the Sheriff, in a penalty at least 
double the value of the property sought to be released, but if that
sum would exceed three times the claim, then in such sum as equals
three times the claim, conditioned that such property, or its esti­
mated value, shall be delivered to the Sheriff to satisfy any judg­
ment which may be obtained against the defendant in that suit,

filed with the Olerk of the Court.

a bond is to be given, unless the parties agree otherwise, the Sher- 
iff shall summon two disinterested persons having the qualification

duty. If such persons disagree as to the value of the property, 
the Sheriff shall decide between them.
Sec. 620. In an action brought upon the bond above contem­ 
plated, it shall be a sufficient defence that the property for the de­
livery of which the bond was given, did not, at the time of the
levy, belong to the defendant against whom the attachment was 
issued.
Sec. 621. When the Sheriff thinks the property attached in 
danger of serious and immediate waste and decay, he may summon
three persons· having the qualifications of jurors, to examine the
same. The Sheriff shall give the defendant, if within the county,
two clear days' notice of such hearing, and he may appear before
such jury and have a personal hearing. If they are of the opinion
that the property requires soon to be disposed of, they shall specify
in writing, a day beyond which they do not deem it prudent that
it should be kept in the hands of the Sheriff. If sueh day occur
before the trial day, he shall thereupon give the same notice as for
goods in execution, and for the same length of time, unless the con­
dition of the preperty renders a more immediate sale necessary.

ment, what he bas done under it. The return must show the prop­
erty attached, the time it was attached, and the disposition made

are summoned, their names, and the time each was summoned,
must be stated. And where real property is attached, the Sheriff
shall describe it with sufficient certainty to identify it, and where
he can do so, by a reference to the book and page where the deed 
under which the defendant holds it is recorded. He shall return
with the writ all bonds taken under it. Such return must be made 
immediately after he shall have attached sufficient property, or all 
that he can find; or, at latest, OR the first day of the term on which
the defendant is notified to appear.

about to be sold, concealed, or removed from the State, or where
the plaintiff states, on oath, that he has reasonable cause to believe,

be sold, concealed, or removed from the State, an attachment may
be granted against the property. 
Sec. 625. In an action by a vender of property, fraudulently
purchased, to vacate the contract, and have a restoration of the
property, or compensation therefor, where the petition shows such
fraudulent purchase of property, and the amount of the plaintiff's

erty may be granted. 
Sec. 626. The attachments in the cases mentioned in the two
last sections, may be granted by the Oourt in which the actien is
brought, or by the Judge thereof, or the Judge of the County
Oourt, upon such terms and conditions as to security, on the part

attached property, as may be just and proper, under the circum­
stances of each case.

shall apply in satisfaction thereof, 1st-The mo:aeys arising from
the sales of perishable property. 2d-The proceeds of the debts

not sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim, the Court shall order a
sale, by the Sheriff, of any other attached property which may be
under its control.

proper orders respecting the property, sales, and the application of

Sec. 636. Any person, other than the defendant, may, before
the sale of any attached property, or liefore the payment to the
plaintiff of the proceeds thereof, or of any attached debt, present
bis petition verified by oath, to the Court, disputing the validity of

ail interest in, or lien on it, under any other attachment, or other­ 
wise, and setting forth the facts upon which such claim is founded;
and the petitioner's claim shall be in a summary manner investi­
gated. The Court may hear the proof or order a referee, or may
empanel a jury to inquire into the facts. If' it is found that the
petitioner has title to, a lien on, or any interest in such property, 
tho Court shall make such order as may be necessary to protect his
rights. The costs of such proceedings shall be paid by either party, 
at the discretion of the Court.
Sec. 637. The facts stated as a cause of attachment, shall not 
be contested in the action by a mere defence. The defendant's
remedy shall be on the bond, but he may, in his discretion, sue
thereon, by way of counter-claim or cross-demand, and in such case,
shall recover damages as in an original action on sueh bond. 
Sec. 638. .A motion may be made to discharge the attachment,
or any part thereof, at any time before trial, for insufficiency of
statement of cause thereof, or for other cause making it apparent
of record that the writ should not have issued, or should not have
been levied on all or on some part of the property held. 
Sec. 639. When an attachment has been discharged, if the
plaintiff then announce his purpose to appeal from such order of
discharge, he shall have two clear days in which to perfect his
appeal, and during that time such discharge shall not operate a
return of the property, nor divest any lien, if such appeal be so
perfected at the end thereof.

any defect of form, in the affidavit, bond, attachment, or other pro­
ceeding; and no attachment shall be dismissed for any defect in,
or want of bond, if the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, will at once
substitute a sufficient bond, but the statements of cause of attach­
ment shall not be amended, nor shall such cause be stated in the
alternative, but the cause or causes relied on shall each be stated
in a direct and categorical manner, or shall be insufficient.

a copy of such execution and all his doings thereon, which shall
be treated by the Clerk of such county, and such entries made in

-stating the time and place at which it was rendered, the names 
of the parties to the action as well as to the judgment, its amount,
and the amount still to be collected thereon, if for money; and,
if not for money, it must state what specific act is required to be
performed. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor,

by the same judgment out of the property of the party against

against whom it is given, or upon the person or officer, who is re­
quired thereby, or by law to obey the same, and his obedience
thereto enforced. 
Sec. 654. Every officer to whose hands an execution may le­
gally come, shall give a receipt therefor, if required, stating the
hour when the same was received, and shall make sufficient return

them. 
Sec. 656. The officer to whom an execution is legally issued,
shall endorse thereon, the day and hour when he received it, and
the levy, sale, or other act done by virtue thereof, with the date,
and the dates and amount of any receipts or payment in satisfac.
tion thereof, the endorsements must be made at the time of the
receipt or act done.

Sec. 659. After exhausting the property of the principal, it
shall be the duty of the officer to subject the property of the other 
parties in the order of their liability in the execution. But the
party subsequently liable, shall, if requested by the officer, show
property of the party liable before him, so as to entitle himself to 
the benefit of this provision.
Sec. 660. But all the parties will be considered as equally lia­ 
ble in all cases, unless the order of liability is shown to the Court,

aggrieved, and shall be guilty ef a misdemeanor in office, and on 
conviction thereof, shall be removed from office. , 
Sec. 666. The officer must execute the writ by levying on the

Sec. 669. In proceedings by garnishment on execution, the
garnishee shall be served as in case of attachment ; his answer 
may . be takeµ by the officer in the same way with the same re­
sults ; he may be notified to appear at the term of court in the
same way, and with the same results, and his default shall be at­
tended with the same consequences. The plaintiff may also, if
the garnishee is called into Oourt, have . a case docketed against
him without docket fee, and upon his answer to the officer, isEt•e
may be made and notice thereof given him, or issue may be
made on hia answer in eourt without any notice thereon, if made
at the same term; and in sll these, and every other particular, the
proceedings skaH be the same as under garnishment or attachment
as-ueer as the nature of the case will allow. 
Sec. 670. Proceedings by garnishment on execution shall not 
be in a.ny manner affected by the expiration of the exeeution or
its return, and where parties thereunder have been garnished, the 
officer shall return to· the next term thereafter a copy of the exe­
cution with all his doings thereon so far as the garnishments there­
on are concerned. 
Sec. 671. Bank bills and other things in action, may be levied
upon and sold, or appropriated as hereinafter provided, and as­
signments thereon by the · officer shall have the same effect· a8 it 
made by the defendant, and may be treated as so made.
Sec. 672. After the rendition of judgment, any person indebt­ 
ed to the defendant in executien, may pay to the Sheriff the
amount ot such indebtedness, or so much thereof as is necessary 
to satisfy the execution, and the Sheriff 'a receipt shall be a suffi­
cient discharge therefor. 
Sec. 673. Public buildings owned by the State, or any county,
city, school district, or other civil corporation, and any other pub­
lic property which is necessary and proper for carrying out the
general purpose for which any such corporation is organized, arc
exempt from execution. The property of a private citizen can in
no ease be levied upon to pay the debt of a civil corporation. 
Sec. 674. In case no property is found on which to levy, which
is not exempted by the last section, or if the judgment creditor
elect not to issue execution against such corporation, he is entitled
to the amount of his judgment, and costs in the ordinary eviden­
ces of indebtedness issued by that corporation. And if the debtor
eorporatien issues no scrip or evidences of debt, a tax must be
levied as early as practicable, sufficient to pay off the judgment
with interest and costs. 
Sec. 675. A failure on the part of the officers of the corpora­
tion to comply with the requirements of the last sectioa renders
them personally responsible for the debt. 
Sec. 676. If an officer who levies, or is required to levy an
execution on personal property, doubts whether it is subject to the
execution, he may give the plaintiff therein, or hie agent or at­
torney, notice that an indemnifying bond is required. Bond may,
thereupon, be given, by or for the plaintiff, with one or more suf­
ficient sureties to be approved by the officer, to the effect that the
obligors will indemnify him against the damages which he may
sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of the property, and
will pay to any claimant thereof the damages he may sustain in
consequence of the seizure or sale, and will warrant to any pur­
chaser of the property, such estate or interest therein as is sold; 
and thereupon the officer shall proceed to subject the property to
the execution, and shall return the indemnifying bond to the Dis­ 
trict Court of the county, in which the levy is made.
Sec. 677. If the bond mentioned in the last section is not given, 
the officer may refuse to levy the execution, or if it has been lev­
ied and the bond is not given in a reasonable time after it is
required by the officer, he may restore the property to the person 
f, om whose possession it was taken, and the levy shall· stand dis­
charged. 
Sec. 678. The claimant or purchaser ot any property, for the
seizure or sale of which an indemnifying bond has been taken and
returned \>y the officer, shall be barred of any action against the
officer levying on the property, if the surety on the bond was good
when it was taken. Any such claimant or purchaser may main­
tain an action upon the bond, and recover such damages as he
may be entitled to. 
Sec. 679. Where property for the sale of which the officer is
indemnified, sells for more than enough to satisfy the execution
under which it was taken, the surplus shall be paid into the Oourt 
to which the indemnifying bond is directed to be returned. That
Court may order such disposition or payment of the money te be
made temporarily or absolutely, as may be proper, in respect to 
the rights of the parties interested.
Sec. 680. The sale ot personal property on which an execution 
is levied, shall be suspended at the instance ot any person, other
than the defendant in execution, claiming the property, who shall
execute, with one or more sureties, sufficient for double its value,
a bond to the plaintiff in the execution to the effect that, if it shall
be adjudged that tae property or any part of it is subject to the
execution, he will pay to the plaintiff the value 9t the property so
s!bject, and ten per cent thereon, notj exceedtng:: the amount due
on the execution, and ten per cent the~Qa.""· :_ ,~: ; 
Sec. 681. For the purpose of ta!dng tl1& booo, "mentioned in
the last section, the officer shall select three dieii{terested persons
having the qualifications of jurors, and administer them an oath,
to make a fair appraisement of each article of the property, whose
appraisement in writing shall be recited in the bond. The bond
with the appraleement annexed thereto, shall be retnred to the
District Court of the county in which the levy was made at the
next term thereafter. 
SEC. 682. The party to whom the bond is executed may move
the Court to which it is returned for a judgment thereon against
all or any of the obligors, or their representatives, having given ·
to them ten days notice of the motion. The Court may cause
such issues to be tried at it may prescribe, and direct which party
shall be considered plaintiff in the issues. If the property or any
part of it is found subject to the execution, judgment shall be ren­
dered in favor of the plaintiff therein for the value of' the proper­
ty so subject, and ten per cent thereon, not exceeding the amount
due on the execution, and ten per cent thereon. An execution
may be issued on the judgment forthwith, on which the same en­
dorsement shall be made as on the execution in virtue of which
the property had been seized. 
SEC. 688. Upon the trial of the motion, either party may ob­
ject that the property was not fairly appraised ; and thereupon the
jury trying the facts shall hear evidence respecting, and find the 
value of the property.
Sec. 684. The giving of the bond mentioned in section -­ 
shall not discharge the levy of the execution upon property
claimed. But the officer may leave it subject to the lien of the
levy with the person in whose possession it is found, pending the
proceeding on the bond; and may, in the mean time, proceed
with the execution against other property of the defendant. 
Sec. 685. The provisions of the proceeding sections of this chapter, as to bonds, shall apply to proceedings upon executions
issued by justices of the peace. Indemnifying bonds shall be re­
turned in such cases, with tb.e execntions under which they are
taken, and bonds of claimants of property may be returned to the
justice from whose office the execution issued and motion thereon
shall be made betore ·him on ive days notice. He shall canse a 
juey as in a ~ivif c!BAse, 1!' 1le impanneled to find whether the pro\>­
erty was subject to:th~ ~~ution, and the judgment shall be sub- 
ject to an appeal. ~c. • ' 
Sec. 686. Whenever a" Sheriff or other officer shall levy an
execution upon the property or effects held jointly or in partner­
ship by the debtor or debtors in execution, with others, to satisfy
the separate debt of such debtor or debtors, the Sheriff or other
officer shall not proceed to make sale thereof, except as hereinafter 
provided, if the person or persons, or any of them holding such
joint or partnership interest with the debtor, shall assert an equi- 
table or other claim thereto, and in writing, notify the officer of
the existence of such claim. 
Sec. 687. When a claim is asserted by the joint owners or part­
ners to the property levied upon, the officer shall not, by virtne of
his levy, deprive the joint owners or partners of the possession of
the preperty levied upon, except for the purpose of making an in­
ventory thereof, and having the same appraised. 
Sec. 688. The officer shall proceed to have the property levied
upon appraised, as provided in section 681, unless the value can 
be agreed upon. He shall return the inventory and the appraise­
ment with the execution, to the office from which it issued; and in
his return shall state all the facts eonaected with the levy by him,
and the claim set up, by the joint owner or owners. 
Sec. 689. The execution creditor shall have a lien upon the
property levied upon, to the extent of his claim, if the same does
not exceed the interest of the judgment debtor in the property,
and which shall continue until the levy is disposed of. 
Sec. 690. Upon the execution being returned by the officer,
that he had levied the same upon the property in which the debtor
was joint owner Qr partner, and that the same was claimed by the 
other joint owners or partaers, the execution creditor may proceed
in an action by equitable proceedings, subject to the liatisfaction of
his execution the interest of the debtor so levied upon. 
Sec. 691. If such creditor, at the commencement of his action,
or afterward, shall file an affidavit that he verily believes the prop­
erty levied upon will be removed from the county, or sold, or other­
wise disposed of, with intent fraudulently to defeat his lien, the
Court, or the Judge thereof, in vacation, may make an order
directing the officer to possess himself of the property so levied
upon, unless bond with approved security shall be executed to the
plaintiff in the execution, binding the obligors in said bond to have
the same forthcoming in obedience to any order or judgment of the
Court in the action, which bond shall be taken by the officer, and
returned by him to the Court in which the action is pending. 
Sec. 692. When judgment has been rendered against any one
for the recovery of' money, he may, by procuring one or more suf­
ticient freehold sureties to enter into a recognizance acknowledging 
themselves security for the defendant for the payment of the judg­
ment, together with the interest and costs accrued and to accrue,
have a stay of execution from the time of rendering judgment, as
Iollowa : 
If the sum for which judgment was rendered, inclusive of costs,
do not exceed fl ve dollars, twenty days. 
If such sum and costs exceed five, but not fifteen dollars, thirty
days. 
If such sum and costs exceed fifteen, but not twenty-five dollars,
torty days. 
If such sum and costs exceed twenty-five, but not torty dollars,
sixty days. 
If saeh sum and costs exceed fifty dollars, then ninety days.
Sec. 693. The provisions of the foregoing section shall not be 
enjoyed by any one who does net take such itay within ten days
from the expiration of the term at which judgment is rendered.
Nor shall the same apply to a case of foreclosure of' mortgage, nor
shall an appeal be taken after such stay has been obtained, nor
shall a stay be taken on a judgment entered as herein contempla­
ted, against one who is surety in the stay of execution. 
Sec. 694. The surety for stay of execution may be taken and
approved by the Clerk, and the recognizance entered of record.
The undertaking in the recognizance shall be for the payment of
the judgment, interest and costs, that may accrue at, or before the
expiration of the term of' the stay of execution. 
Sec. 695. When the surety is entered after execution issued,
the Olerk shall immediately notify the Sheriff of the stay, and he
shall forthwith return the execution, with his doings thereon. 
Sec. 696. All property levied on before stay of execution, and
all written undertakings, for the delivery of personal property to
the Sheriff, shall be relinquished by the officer, npon stay of execu­
tion being entered. 
Sec. 697. Every recognizance taken as above provided, shall
have the effect of a judgment confessed, from the date thereof,
against the property of the sureties. 
Sec. 698. At the expiration of the stay, it shall be the duty of
the Clerk to issue a joint execution against the property of all the 
judgment debtors and sureties, describing them as debtors or sure­
ties therein. 
Sec. 699. When any Court shall render judgment against two 
or more persons, any of whom is surety for any other in the con­
tract on which the judgment is founded, there shall be no stay of 
execution allowed, if the surety object thereto at the time of ren­ 
dering the judgment, whereupon it shall be ordered by the Court
that there be no stay, unless the surety for the stay of execution 
will undertake specifically to pay the judgment, in case the amount
thereof cannot be levied of the principal defendant. 
Sec. 700. Any surety for the stay of execution may file with
the Clerk an affidavit, stating that he verily believes he will be
lis ble for the judgment, interest and costs thereon, unless execution
issues immediately; and the Clerk shall thereupon issue execution
forthwith, unless other sufficient: surety be entered before the
Clerk, as in other cases. 
Sec. 701. If other snflieient surety be entered, it shall have the
force of the original surety entered before the filing of the affidavit,
and shall discharge the original surety. 
Sec. 702. Where a stay ot execution has been taken, such con­
fessed judgment shall not release any judgment lien, by virtue of
the original judgment for the amount then due. The officer hold­
ing the said execution, shall return thereon what amount was made
from the principal debtor, and how much from the surety. 
Sec. 703. The following property of private individuals is ex­
empt from execution : All wearing apparel kept for actual use, and
suitable to the condition of the party, and trunks and other recep­
tacles to contain the same; one musket or rifle; the proper tools,

residents, nor of those who have started to leave this State, but
their property is liable to execution, with the exception of ordinary
wearing apparel, and trunks to contain the same; but any person
coming to this State with the intention of remaining, is a resident
within the meaning of this chapter. 
Sec. 708. Where a debtor absconds and leaves his family, such
property shall be exempt in the hands of the wife and children, or

Sec. 709. The sheriff must give four weeks notice of the time
and place of selling real property, and three weeks notice of that 
of personal property.
SEC. 710. Notice shall be given by being posted up in at least 
three public places of the county, one of which shall be at the
place where the last District Oourt was held. In addition to which,
in case of the sale of real estate, or where personal property to the
amount of two hundred dollars or upwards is to be sold, there shall
be two publications of such notiee, in some newspaper printed in
the county, if there be one. In constables' sales, there shall be no
newspaper publication, and the notice shall be posted in three
public places of the township ot the justice, and one of them at his 
office door ; the time of such notice shall be two weeks.
Sec. 711. An officer selling without the notice above preserib- 
' 
ed, shell forfeit one hundred dollars to the defendant in execution,
in addition to the actual damages sustained by either party ; but
the validity of the sale is not thereby affected. 
Sec. 712. The sale must be at public auction, between nine
o'clock in the forenoon, and four o'clock in the afternoon. 
Sec. 713. When there are no bidders, or when the amount of­
fered is grossly inadequate, or when from any cause the sale is
prevented from taking place on tho day fixed, the sheriff may
postpone sale for not more than three days, without being requir­
ed to give any farther notice thereof; but he shall not make more
than two such postponements, and such postponement shall be
publicly announced when the sale should have taken place. 
Sec. 714. When property sells for more than the amount re­
quired to be collected, the overplus must be paid to the defendant,
unless the officer have another execution in his hands, on which
said overplns may be rightfully applied. 
Sec. 715. If the property levied on sell for less than sufficient
for that purpose, the plaintiff may order out another execution, 
which shall be credited with the amount of the previous sale. The
proceedings under this second sale, shall conform to those herein­
before prescribed. 
Sec. 716. When the property is unsold for want of bidders, the
levy still holds good; and if there is sufficient time the property 
may again be advertised and sold under the same execution, or
the execution may be returned and a vendi-uorvi eeponas issued. 
Sec. 717. If the defendant is in actual occupation and posses­
sion of any part of the land levied on, the officer having the exe­
cution, shall, at least twenty days previous to such sale, serve the
defendant with written notice, stating that the execution is levied
on said land, and mentioning the time and place of sale ; and sales
made without the notice required in this section, are void. 
Sec. 718. At any time before nine o'clock, a. m., of' the day of
sale, the defendant may deliver to the officer a plan of division of
the lands levied on, subscribed by him, and it shall in that case,
be the duty of the officer to sell, according to said plan, so much
of the land as may be necessary to satisfy the debt and costs, and
no more. If no such plan is furnished, the officer may sell with­
out any division. 
Sec. 719. When the purchaser fails to pay the money when de­
manded, the plaintiff or his attorney may elect to proceed against 
him for the amount ; otherwise the sheriff shall treat the sale as a
nullity, and may sell the property again on the same day, or atter
a postponement, as above authorized. 
Sec. 720. Where any person has heretofore, or shall hereafter,
purchase at sheriff's sale, any real estate on which the judgment 
upon which the execution issued was not a lien at the time of the
levy, and which fact was unknown to the purchaser, the District
Court of the county shall set aside such sale on motion, notice hav­ 
ing been given to the debtor, as in case of action, and a new exe­
cution may be issued to enforce the judgment, and upon the order 
being made to set aside the sale, the sheriff or judgment-creditor
shall pay over the purchaser the purchase money. 
Sec. 721. Money levied upon may be appropriated without be­
ing advertised or sold. The same may be done with bank bills,
drafts, promissory notes, or other papers of the like character, if
the plaintiff will receive them at their par value, as cash, or if the
officer can exchange them for cash at that value. 
Sec. 722. When a judgment has been obtained against the
executor of one deceased, which the personal estate of the deceas­
ed is insufficient to satisfy, the plaintiff may file his petition in the
office of the clerk of the District Court, wherein judgment was
rendered against the executor, the heirs and devisees of real estate
(if there art, such.) setting forth the facts, and that there is real
estate of the deceased within the State, describing its location and
extent, and praying the Court to award execution against the
same. 
Sec. 723. A notice shall thereupon be endorsed upon said
petition, notifying the persons against whom the petition is filed,
to appear on the first day of the term, and show cause, if any they
have, why execution should not be awarded. 
Sec. 724. The petition and notice shall be served and returned
in the ordinary manner, and the same length of time shall be al­ 
lowed for appearance, as in civil actions.
Sec. 725. At the proper time, the Court shall award the execu­ 
tion, unless sufficient cause be shown to the contrary.
Sec. 726. The non-age of the heirs or devisees shall not be 
deemed such sufficient cause.
Sec. 727. Mutual judgments, the executions on which are in 
the hands or the same officer, may be set off, the one against the
other; except that the costs shall not be so set off, unless the bal- 
anee of cash actually collected on the larger judgment is sufficient
to pay the costs of both judgments, and such costs shall be paid 
therefrom accordingly.
Sec. 728. When real property has been levied upon, if the 
estate is less than a lease-hold, having two years of an unexpired
term, the sale is absolute. 
Sec. 729. When the estate is of a larger amount, the property
is redeemable, as hereinafter prescribed. 
Sec. 730. At the time of the sale, the sheriff shall give to the
purchaser a certificate containing a description of the property and
the amount of money paid by such purchaser ; and stating that un­
less redemption is made within one year thereafter, according to law, 
he or his heirs Ot" assigns, will be entitled to a deed for the same.
Sec. 731. The defendant may redeem such property at any 
time within one year from the day of sale, as hereinafter provid­
ed; and will, in the mean time, be entitled to the possession of'
the property. 
Sec. 732. For the first six months after such sale, his right to
redeem is exclusive, but if no redemption is made by him at the
end of that time, any creditor of the defendant, whose demand is
a lien upon such real estate, may redeem the same at any time
within nine months from the day of sale. But a mechanic's lien,
before judgment thereon, is not of such a character as to entitle
the holder to redeem. 
Sec. 733. Any creditor whose claim becomes a lien prior to
the expiration of the time allowed by law tor redemption by cred­
itors, may redeem. A mortgagee may thus redeem before or after
the debt secsred by the mortgage falls due. 
Sec. 734:. Creditors having the right of redemption, may re­
deem from each other within the time above limited, and in the
manner herein provided. 
Sec. 735. The terms of redemption in all cases, will be the re·
imbursement of the amount paid by the then holder, added to the
amount of his own lien, with interest, upon the whole at the rate
of ten per cent. per annum, together with costs, subject to the ex­
ception contained in the next section. But where a mortgagee,
whose claim is not yet due, is the person from whom the redemp­
tion is thus to be made, a rebate of interest, at the rate of ten per
cent. per annum, must be made by such mortgagee on his claim. 
Sec. 736. When a senior creditor thus redeems from his junior, 
he is required to pay off only the amount of those liens which are
paramount to his own, with the interest and costs appertaining to
those liens. 
Sec. 737. But the junior creditor may in all such casea prevent
a redemption by the holder of the paramount lien, by paying off
that lien, or by leaving with the clerk before hand the amount 
necessary therefor.
Sec. 788. A junior judgment creditor may redeem from a senior 
judgment creditor, by paying to the party, the clerk or the sheriff, 
if execution has issued, the full sum due, with interest and costs,
and shall become there•y vested with the title to the judgment so
redeemed. 
Sec. 789. If paid to the sheriff, ae shall give the party:ii1re­
deeming a certificate, that he has paid such sum for the redemp­
tion of the judgment, describing it, which being presented to the
clerk, he shall enter such redemption Oil the judgment docket, as
he shall also do if the money is paid to himself. 
Sec. 740. Whenever a senior creditor redeems from a junior
creditor, the latter may, in return, redeem from the former, and
so on, as often as the land is taken from him by virtue of a para­
mount lien. 
Sec. 741. After the expiration of nine months from the day of
sale, the creditors can no longer redeem from each other, except 
as hereinafter provided. But the defendant may still redeem at
any time before the end of the year, as aforesaid. 
Sec. 742. Unless the defendant thus redeems, the purchaser,
or the creditor, who last redeemed, prior to the expiration of the
nine months aforesaid, will hold the property absolutely. 
Sec. 743. In case it is thus held by a redeeming creditor, his
lien, and the claim out of which it arose, will be held to be ex­
tinguished, unless he pursues the course pointed out in the next 
section.
Sec. 744. If he is unwilling to hold the property and credit 
the defendant therefor, with the fall amount of his lien, he must,
within ten day1 after the nine months aforesaid, enter on the sale
boek the utmost ameunt that he is thus willing to credit on his 
claim.
Sec. 745. Any unsatisfied lien creditor, within ten days after 
the expiration of the time thus allowed to make the entry required
in the last section, may redeem the property by paying the amount 
ot the legal disbursements of the last holder, as hereinbefore reg­
ulated, added to the amount thus entered on the sale book, to·
gether with interest and costs. 
Sec. 746. Such redemptioner shall also credit the defendant
with the full amount of his lien, unless within ten days after re­
deeming as aforesaid, he likewise makes a like entry on the sale
book, in which case any unsatisfied lien creditor, may :a like man­
ner redeem within ten days as aforesaid, and so on, until there are
no more unsatisfied liens, or until the expiration of the year for re­
demption, the defendant having the final privilege of redeeming 
from the last redemption, at tho end of the year.
Sec. 747. The mode of making the redemption i11 by paying 
the money into the clerk's office for the use of the persons thereto
entitled. The person so redeeming, if not defendant in execu­
tion, must also tile his affidavit, or that of his agent or attorney,
stating as nearly as practicable, the amount still unpaid and due 
on his own claim.
Sec. 748. The clerk shall thereupon give him a receipt for the 
money, stating the purpose for which it was paid. He must also,
at the same time, enter in the sale book a minute of such redemp­
tion, of the amount paid, and the amount of the lien of the last
redemption as sworn to him. 
Sec. 749. A creditor redeeming as above contemplated, is en­
titled to receive an assignment of the certificate issued by the
sheriff, to the original purchaser as herein before directed. 
Sec. 750. When the property has been sold in parcels, any dis­
tinct portion may be redeemed by itself. 
Sec. 751. When the interests of several tenants in common,
have been sold on execution, the undivided portion of any or
either of them may be redeemed separately. 
Sec. 752. The rights ot a defendant in relation to redemption,
are transferrable, and the assignee has the like power to redeem. 
Sec. 753. If the defendant or his assignee fail to redeem, the
sheriff must, at the end of the year, execute a deed to the person
who is entitled to the certificate as herein before provided, or to his
assignee. If the person entitled be dead, the deed shall be made
to his heirs, but the property will be subject to the payment of the
debts of the deceased, in the same manner, as if acquired during 
his lifetime. 
Sec. 754. The purchaser of real estate at a sale on execution, , 
need not place any evidence of his purchase upon record, until
twenty days after the expiration of the full time of redemption.
Up to that time the publicity of the proceedings is constructive
notice of the rights of the purchaser, but no longer. 
Sec. 755. Deeds executed by a sheriff in pursuance of such
sales, are presumptive evidence of the regularity of all previous
proceedings, in the case, and may be given in evidence without
preliminary proof. 
Sec. 756. When real estate has been sold on execution, the
purchaser thereof, or any person who has succeeded to his inter­
est, may, after his estate becomes absolute, recover damages for
any injury to the property committed after the sale and before
possession is delivered under the conveyance. 
Sec. 757. The term "defendant" as herein used, is intended to
designate the party agair.st whom, and the term "plaintiff" the
party in favor of' whom, any execution has issued. 
Sec. 758. The provisions of this chapter are intended to em­
brace proceedings in justices' courts, so far as they are applicable ;
and the terms " sheriff'," and "clerk," are accordingly to be un­
derstood, as qualified in this chapter, in the same manner, in this
respect, as in that relative to attachment. 
CHAPTER XX. 
PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENTAL TO EXECUTION. 
Sec. 759. When an execution against the property of a judg­
ment debtor, or one of several debtors in the same judgment has
been issued from the District or Supreme Court to the sheriff ot
the county where such debtor resides, or it he do not reside in the
State, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment was ren­
dered, or a transcript of a justices' judgment has been filed, and
execution issued thereon, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in
part, the owner of the judgment is entitled to an order for the ap­
pearance and examination of such debtor. 
Sec. 760. The like order. may be obtained at any time after
the issuing of an execution upon proof, by the affidavit of the

cers, the compensation of referees, the necessary expenseq of

sum fer any other matter which the Oourt may have awarded as
costs, in the prC\gress of the cause, or may deem just to be taxed.

signment, after the commencement of the action, or in any other
manner, become the property of a person not a party to the ac­
tion, such party shall be liable for the costs in the same manner
as if he were a party. 
SEC. 847. Any persen aggrieved by the taxation of a bill of'
costs, may, upon application, have the same re-taxed by the Ceurt,
or by a referee, appointed by the Court, in which the application

corrected ; and if the party aggrieved shall have paid any unlaw­ 
ful charge, by reason of the first taxation, the Clerk shall pay the

low shall charge himself with the money upon his execution
docket, and pay it to the persons entitled to the same. 
SEC. 851. The law of costs shall be construed remedially, and
not as the penal law. And if any case shall occur not directly
or by fair implication embraced in the express provisions of the, 
law, the Court may make such disposition of the costs, as in its
sound discretion may seem right, 
Sec. 852. When the judgment is for the recovery of money,

Sec. 887. The proceedings to obtain the benefit of sub-divis­
ions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, of section 885, shall be by petition, verified

Court, in the same way, on the same notice as to time, mode of
service, and mode of return, and the pleadings shall be governed
by the principles, and issues be made up by the same formula,

fining such part. 
Sec. 896. An appeal from part of an order, or from one of the
judgments of a final adjudication, or from· part of a judgment, shall

thereof has been served upon both .the party and the clerk, and

the attorney of a party, a transcript of the record in the cause, or
of so much thereot as the appellant in writing in his notice has 
directed, to which shall be appended copies of the notices of ap­
peal, and of the supersedeas bond, if any. 
Sec. 898. In an action for ordinary proceedings, and in an ac­
tion by equitable proceedings, tried by the second method of try­
ing equitable actions, all proper entries made by the clerk, and all 
papees pertaining to the cause, and filed therein, (except subpcenas,
depositions, and other papers, which are used as mere evidence,)
are to be deemed part of the record. Bnt in an action by eqnita­
ble proceedings tried by the first method of trying equitable ae­
tions, the depositions and all papers which were used as evidence,
are to be certified up to the Supreme Court, and shall be so certi­
fied, not by transcript but in the original form. But a transcript
of a motion, affidavit, or other paper, when it relates to a collat-
teral matter, shall not be certified, unless by direction of the ap­
pellant. If so certified, when not material to the determination
of the appeal, the Court may direct the person blamable therefor
to pay the costs thereof. 
Sec. 899. The notices of appeal must be served fifteen days
before the first day of the next term of the Supreme Court, or the
same shall not then be tried, unless the appellee shall give the
appellant ten days before the term, notice indicating that he will 
insist on a hearing at such term, in which event the cause shall
be heard at such term, unless the appellant shall, on a sufficient
showing, obtain a continuance. 
Sec. 900. If the appellant having taken an appeal fifteen days
before the term, fails to file a transcript in the Supreme Court, on·
the morning of the first day of that part of the term, devoted to
causes from the district whence comes the appeal, or if not taken
as many as fifteen days before the term, he fail to have the case
so tiled at the next succeeding term on the morning aforesaid, in
either event, unless the appellant file at the time, when such tran­
script should be filed, the certificate ot. the clerk stating when he
was served with notice, and that he has not had sufficient time to
prepare a transcript, the appellee may tile a transcript. of the judg- 
ment, and of the notice served on the clerk, and may, on motion,
have the appeal dismissed, or the judgment affirmed. 
Sec. 901. If the transcript has been sent up, but the appellant
does not file the same, when the same should be filed as herein
provided the appellee may file the same, and may, on motion,
have the appeal dismissed, or the judgment affirmed, as the Court
from the circumstances of the case shall determine. 
Sec. 902. If the transcript being filed, errors are not assigned
by the morning of the first of those days devoted to causes from
the district whence comes the appeal, the appellee may, on motion,
have the appeal dismissed, or the judgment or order affirmed. 
Sec. 903. A part of several co-parties may appeal, but in such
case they must serve notice of the appeal upon all the other co­ 
parties, and file the proof thereof, with the clerk of the Supreme
Court. 
Sec. 904. If the other co-parties refuse to join, they cannot nor
can any of them take an appeal afterwards; nor shall they derive
any benefit from the appeal, unless from the necessity of the
cause. 
Sec. 905. Unless they appear and decline to join, they shall
be deemed to have joined, and shall be liable for their due pro­
portion of costs. 
Sec. 906. The death of one or all of the parties shall not cause
the proceedings to abate, but the names of the proper persons
shall be substituted, as is provided in such cases in the District 
Court, and the cause may proceed. The Court may also, in such
case grant a continuance, when such a course will be calculated to
promote the ends of justice. 
Sec. 907. The service of all notices of appeal, or in any way
growing out of such right, or connected therewith, and all notices
in the Supreme Oourt, shall be in the way provided tor the ser­ 
vice ef like notices in the District Court, and they may be served
by the same person and returned in the same manner, and the
original notice of appeal must be returned, immediately after ser­
vice, to the office of the clerk of the District Court where the suit
is pending. 
Sec. 908. It shall be the duty of the appellant to file a perfect
transcript, and to that end-the clerk of the District Court, must at
any time on his suggestion of diminution of the record, and on
the payment of fees, certify up any omitted part of the record, 
according to the truth, as the same appears in his offic~ ot record;
and such applicant shall not be entitled to any continuance, in or­
der to correct the record, unless it shall clearly appear to the Court
that he is not in fault. Subject to which requirement, either party
may, on motion before trial day, obtain an order on the clerk of
the District Court, commanding him to transmit at once to the
Supreme Court, a true copy of such imperfect or omitted part of
the record, as shall be in general terms described in the affidavit
and order. Such motion must be supported by affidavit, unless
the diminution be apparent or admitted by the adverse party, and
must not be granted unless the Court is satisfied that it is not 
made tor delay.
Sec. 909. Where a view of an original paper in the action may 
be important to a correct decision of the appeal, the Court may
order the Clerk of the District Court to transmit the same, which
he shall do in some safe mode, to the Clerk of the Supreme Court,
who shall hold the same subject to the control of the Court. 
Sec. 910. The appellant may be required to give security for
costs, under the same circumstances as those in which plaintiffs in
civil actions in the District Court, may be so required. 
Sec. 911. An appeal shall not stay proceedings on the judgment
or order, or any part thereof, unless a aupersedeas is issued, and
no appeal or supersedeas shall vacate or affect the lien of the judg­
ment appealed from. 
Sec. 912. A supersedeas shall not be issued until the appellant
shall cause to be executed before the Clerk ot the Court which ren­
dered the judgment or order, by one or more sufficient sureties, tq
be approved by such Clerk, a bond to the effect that the appellant
shall pay to the appellee all costs and damages that shall be ad­
judged against the appellant on the appeal; also, that he will sat­
isfy and perform the judgment or order appealed from, in case it
shall be affirmed, and any judgment or order which the Supreme
Court may render, or order to be rendered, by the inferior Court,
not exceeding in amount or value the original judgment or order,
and all rents, or hire, or damages to property during the pendency
of the appeal, out of the possession of which the appellee is kept
by reason ef the appeal. It the bond is intended to stay proceed­
ings, or only a part of the judgment or order, it shall be varied so
as to secure the part superseded alone. When such bond has been
affirmed by the Clerk, and filed, he shall issue a written order 
commanding the appellee and all others, to stay proceedings on
such judgment or order, or on such part as is superseded, as the
case may be. 
Sec. 913. If the appellee believe the supersedas bond defective,
or the sureties inaaffleient, he may move the Supreme Court, if in
session, or in its vacation, on ten days written notice to the appel­
lant, may move any Judge of said Court, or the Judge of the Dis­
trict Court where the appeal was taken, to discharge the super­
sedeas, aad if the Court, or such Judge, shall consider the sureties
insufficient, or the bond substantially defective in securing the
rights of the sppellee, the Court, or such Judge, shall issue an order
discharging the supersedeas, unless a good bond, with sufficient
sureties, be executed by a day by him fixed. The order, if made
by a Judge, shall be in writing, and signed by him, and upon its
filing, or the filing of a certified copy of the order when made in
Court, in the office of the Clerk of the District Oourt, execution
and other proceediags for enforcing the judgment or order may be
taken, if a new and good bond is not filed and approved by the day
fixed as aforesaid. 
Sec. 914. But another supersedeas may be issued by the Clerk,
upon the execution before him, of a new and lawfnl bond with
sufficient sureties, as hereinbefore provided. 
SEC. 915. If the judgment or order is for the payment of money,
the penalty shall be in at least twice the amount of the judgment
and costs. It not for the payment of money, the penalty shall ae
sufficient to save the appellee harmless from the consequences of 
t"J\~ing the appeal. But it shall in no case be less than one hundred
dollars. 
Sec. 916. The taking of' the appeal from a part of a judgment
er order, sad the filing of a bond as above directed, does not cause
a stay of execution as to any part of the judgment or order not 
appealed from.
Sec. 917. When execution has issued prior to giving the bond above 
contemplated, the Clerk shall countermand the same.
Sec. 918. Property levied npon and not sold at the time such 
countermand is received by the Sheriff, shall forthwith be delivered
up to the judgment debtor. 
Sec. 919. The Clerk shall arrange the appeals upon the docket, 
setting a proper number for each day of the term, and placing
together those from the same judicial district. 
Sec. 920. The Supreme Court may reverse or affirm the judg­
ment or order below, or the part of either appealed from, or may
render such judgment or order as the District Court (or Judge)
should have done, according as it may think proper. 
Sec. 921. The Supreme Court, where it affirms the judgment,
shall also, if the appellee moves therefor, render judgment against
the appellant and his sureties in the bond above mentioned, for the
amount of the judgment, damages and costs referred to therein, in
case such damages can be accurately known to the Court without
an issue and trial. 
Sec. 922. Upon the afflrmance of any judgment or order for
the payment of money, the collection of which, in wkole or part, 
has been superseded by bond, as above contemplated, the Court
shall award to the appellee 'damages upon the amount superseded;
and if satisfied by the record, that the appeal was taken for delay
only, must award such sum as damages, not exceeding fifteen per
cent. thereon, as shall effectually tend to prevent the taking of 
appeals for delay only.
Sec. 993. It the Supreme Court affirm the ju.dgment or order, 
it may send the cause to the District Court to have the same car­
ried into effect, or it may itself issue the nececesaarj- process for
this purpose, and direct such process to the Sheriff of the proper
county, according as the party thereto may require. 
Sec. 924. If by the decision of the Supreme Court, the appel­
lant becomes entitled to a restoratien of any part of the money or
property that was taken from him by means of such judgment or
order, either the Supreme or District Court may direct execution
or writ of restitution to issue for the purpose of restoring to such
appellant his property or value thereof. · 
Sec. 925. Property acquired by a bona. fide purchaser, under a
judgment subsequently reversed, shall not be affected by such
reversal. 
Sec. 926. The Supreme Court shall have power to enforce its
mandates upon inferior Courts and officers, by fine and imprison­ 
ment, which imprisonment may be continued until obeyed. •
Sec. 927. It a petition for re-hearing be filed, the same shall 
suspend the decision or procedendo, if the Court, on its presenta­
tion, or one of the Judges, if in vacation, shall so order, in either 
18 
of which cases such decision and procedendo shall be suspended
until the next term. 
Sec. 928. The petition for re-hearing shall be the argument of
the applicant therefor, and if the Oourt think that such argument
requires a reply, it shall so indicate to the other party, and he may
make reply within such time as said Oourt shall allow, and with a
view to a re-hearing, the Court may extend the suspension of pro­ 
ceedings yet farther, if need be.
Sec. 929. A judgment or order shall not be reversed for an 
error which can be corrected, on motion, in the inferior Court,
until such motion has been made there and overruled. 
Sec. 930. An assignment of error need follow no stated form,
but must, in a way, as specific as the case will allow, point out the
very error objected to. Among several points in a demurrer, or in
a motion, or Instructions, or rulings in an exception, it must desig­
nate which is relied on as an error, and the Court will only regard 
-errors which are assigned with the required exactness.
Sec. 931. All motions must be entered in the motion book, and 
shall stand over till the next morning after that morning on which
entered, and till atterJiaving been publicly called by the Court,
unless the parties otherwise agree, and the ad verse party shall be 
deemed to have notice of such motion.
Sec. 932. The Court shall hear all the causes docketed, when 
not continued by consent, or for cause shown by the party, and

CHAPTER XL VII. 
A.OTION OF :MANDAMUS. 
Sec. 1145. The writ of mandamus is an order of a Court of
competent jurisdiction, and issues from the District Court eem­
mending an inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person, to do
or not ·ie do, an act, the performance or omission of which the law 
speciallj enjoins as a duty, resulting from an office trust or station,
and it is granted on the petition of any private party aggrieved
without the concurrence of the prosecutor for the State, or on the
petition of the State by the District Attorney, when the public
interest is· concerned, and is in the name of such private party, or 
of the State as the case may be in fact brought.
Sec. 1146. The plaintiff in such action shall state hie claim, 
and shall also state tsete sufficient to constitute a cause for such 
claim, and shall also set forth that the plaintiff', if a private indi­
vidual, is personally interested therein, and that he sustains and
may sustain damage by the non-performance of such duty, and
that performance thereof has been demanded by him, and refused
or neglected, and shall pray a writ of mandamus commanding the
defendant to fulfil such duty. 
Sec. 1147. Where a discretion is left to an inferior trihnnal,
the writ of mandamus can only compel it to act. It cannot con­
trol the discretion of the inferior tribunal. 
Sec. 1148. The writ .may also be isaned by the Supreme Oourt
to any District Oourt, if necessary, and also in any other case
where it is found necessary, to enable it to exercise its legitimate
power. 
Sec. 149. It ought not to be issued in any case where there
is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course ot
the law, except as herein provided. 
Sec. 1150. The pleadings and other proceedings in any action
in which a mandamus is claimed shall be the same in all respects
as nearly as may be, and cests shall be recoverable by either party,
as in an ordinary action for the recovery of damages. 
Sec. 1151. The plaintiff in any action except those of chap­
ters 36, 87 and 38, hereof, may also in aid of such cause of action
pray, and have a writ of mandamus to compel' the performance of
a duty established in such action. But if such duty, the perform·
aace of which is sought to be compelled, is not one resu1ti•g from
an office, trust, or station, it must be one for the breach ot which
a legal right to damages is already eomplete · at the commence­
ment of the action, and must also be a duty of which a Oourt of
equity woald enforce the performance. 
Sec. 1152. In case judgment be giten to the plaintiff that a
mandamus do issue, it shall be lawful for the Oonrt in which such
jsdgment is given, if it shall see fit, besides issuing execution in 
the ordinary way for the damages and costs, also to issue a per­
emptory writ of mandamus to the defendant commanding him
forthwith to perform the duty to be enforced. 
Sec. 1153. The writ shall simply command the performance
of the duty, shall be· directed to the party and »ot to the Sheriff,
and may be issued in term or vacation and returnable forthwith,
and no return except t.hat of compliance. shall be allowed, but time 
to return it may upon snfficient grounds be allowed by tpe Court
or Judge, either with or without terms. 
Sec. 1154. The Court may, upon application of the plaintiff,
besides, or instead of proceeding against the defendant ·by attach·

special proceeding, it is expressly otherwise provided, and when· 
it is provided that any action or special proceeding shall be pro- 
secuted by equitable proceedings, the same shall not differ in the

shall be held to be used in such sense, except when the contrary is
expressed, but the use of a term herein, which has at common law
a technical meaning, shall not imply its use in such technical sense

proceeding wherein used is law, as contradistinguished from equity.

matter may he herein set out, shall be substituted for part third of
the Code of' Iowa of 1851, and to that end every portion of part

designation of such section, as such section is numbered in said

which are within the purview of' this act, are also repealed, so that
this act shall be the sole law in civil pleadings and practice, and 
when this act is published, the sections of the Code aforesaid shall
be printed in full, each in that place now herein designated, by the 
number by which such section is now known in said Code, and

as herein indicated shall be also incorporated into those section! 
which refer to other sections, either of this act or of the Code
aforesaid.
