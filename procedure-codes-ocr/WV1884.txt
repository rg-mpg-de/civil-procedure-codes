third section shall be levied on personal estate only. The plaintiff may, by an endorsement on the order, designate any person as
.being indebted to, or having in his possession, the effects of the defendant, or one of the defendants; and in such case the clerk shall
make as many copies of the order as there are persons designated,
with an endorsement thereon that the person so designated is required to appear ut the next term of the court in which the action
or snit is pending, and disclose on oath in what sum he is indebted

hands; and it shall be sufficiently levied on such person by delivering him a copy of the order and endorsement, or by a service thereof

amount of the claim sworn to, with condition to pay all costs and
damages which may be awarded against him, or sustained by any
person hy reason of the suing ont of the attachment, and to pay to
any claimant of any property seized or sold under or by virtue of
said attachment, ull damages which he may recover in consequence
of such seizure or sale; and also to warrant and defend to any purchaser of the property such estate or interest therein as is sold, the

hands of some other proper officer; and it shall be the duty of any
such officer to take the attached property into his possession and
make return of such order in like manner as if said bond had been
given before the issuing of the original attachment.

therein, and if the exceptions be sustained by the court, the attached
property shall he returned to the defendant, unless the plaintiff give
a proper bond, with sufficient security, to be approved by the court

attachment, or serving a copy thereof, as aforesaid, upon the
personal property, choses in action, and other securities of the defendunt against whom the claim is, in the hands of, or due from,
any such garnishee on whom it is so served, and on any real estate
levied on hy virtue thereof, from the suing out of the same. But if
no bond be given by the plaintiff, and such personal property, choses

attaehment thereon shall cease and determine from the date of such
sale or disposition.

by, the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending, or to which

sufficiency of the security therein. If such exceptions be sustained,
the court shall rule the said officer to file a good bond, with sufficient
security, to be approved by it, on or before a certain day to be fixed
by the court. If he fail to do so; he and his sureties in his official
bond shall be liable to the plaintiff' as for a breach of such bond.
But the officer shall have the same rights and remedies against the
parties to any bond so adjudged bad, as if he were a surety for
such them.

12. When any attachment is sued out, either at Jaw or in equity
(except against non-residents), on such affidavit as is mentioned in

defendant, if the court deem it proper; and at any time during such
period the court, or in vacation the judge thereof, may discharge

whom the claim is, on his giving bond, with security, payable to the
plaintiff' in a penalty double the value of such estate, with condition,

pay the said value, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy
the same.

13. AH property seized under any attachment, and not rcplevied
or sold before judgment, shall be kept in the same manner as similar property taken under execution.
But such as is expensive to

possession or control any goods, chattels, money, securities or other
effects belonging to the said defendant, the court muy order him to
pay the amount so due by him, and to deliver such effects to such
person as it may appoint as receiver; or such garnishee, with leave
of the court, may give bond, with sufficient security, payable to such
person and in such penalty as the court may prescribe, with condition to pay the amount due by him and have such effects forthcoming at such time and place as the court may thereafter require.

15. If any garnishee summoned as aforesaid fail to appear in an
attachment at law, the court may either compel him to appear or
hear proof of any debt due by him to, or effects in his hands of, the
defendant in such attachment, and make such orders in relation
thereto as if what is so proved had appeared in his examination.

16. When it is suggested by the plaintiff in any attachment at
law that the garnishee has not fully disclosed the debts doe by him
to, or effects in his hands of, the defendant in such attachment, the
court shall cause a jury to be impaneled, without any formal pleadings, to inquire as to such debts and effects, and proceed in respect.

garnishee, he shall have judgment for his costs against the plaintiff.

being adjudged bad, may make defense to such attachment, but the
attachment shall not thereby he discharged or the property levied
on released.

19. The right to sue out an attachment may he contested, and
when the court is of opinion that the facts stated in the affidavit
were not sufficient to authorize the issuing thereof, 01Â· that the affidavit is otherwise insufficient, judgment shall be entered that the attachment be quashed. If the defendant desire to controvert the existence of the grounds for the attachment stated in the affidavit, he
may file a plea in abatement. denying the existence of such grounds,
and tlie issue on such plea shall be tried by a jury, unless the same
he waived by the parties. The affirmative of such issue shall be
with the plaintiff'; and if he fail to prove to the satisfaction of the
jury the existence of the grounds denied by the defendant, the verdict
shall be for the defendant, and judgment shall be entered that the
attachment be abated. But the court may grant new trials as in
other cases. When the attachment is properly sued out, and the case
heard upon its merits, if the court be of opinion that the claim of
the plaintiff is not established, final judgment shall be given for the
defendant. In either case the defendant shall recover his costs, and
there shall be an order for the restoration to him of the attached effects.

real estate shall report to the court which ordered the sale, the real
estate so sold by him, with the name of the purchaser, the sum for
which it sold, and the time and place of such sale. The court for
good cause, may refuse to confirm the sale, and order the property to
be re-sold ; but if good cause for setting the sale aside be not shown,
the court shall confirm the same, and shall direct a deed of conveyance of the real estate so sold to be ma<le to the purchaser thereof,
by the officer or person who sold t.he same, or by a special cornmissioner appointed for that purpose, whenever the purchase money
thereof, with its interest, shall have been fully paid. An officer
heretofore or hereafter directed by the court to make such conveyance may make the same in his official character, notwithstanding his
term of office shall have expired. And in case of the death, removal, inability, or failure or refusual to act, of the officer or person
heretofore or hereafter appointed to make any such sale or conveyance, before the same is made, the circuit court of the county in which

personal property be levied upon, and ordered to be sold, where
there has been no such appearance or service of the attachment, as
aforesaid, and no bond has been given by the plaintiff as provided
in section six of this chapter, the court shall require such bond to
be given by the plaintiff, and if the plaintiff, or some one for him,
fail to give such bond within a reasonable time, the court shall dispose of such property,' or the proceeds thereof, as to it shall seem
just.


23. Any person interested may file his petition at any time before the property attached, as the estate of a defendant, is sold under the decree or judgment, or if the proceeds of the sale have not
been paid over to the plaintiff', or his assigns, within one year after

under any other attachment or otherwise, and its nature, and upon
giving security for costs, the court, without any other pleading, shall
impanel a jury to inquire into such claim, and if it be found that
the petitioner has title to, or lien on, or any interest in such property 01Â· its proceeds, the court shall make such order as is. necessary
to protect his rights j the cost of which inquiry shall be paid by
either party, at the discretion of the court.

or on the person having such property in his possession, shall have
priority of lien; and the officer making the levy shall note on the
order of attachment the day and hour at which the levy is made.
Provided, That where two or more attachments are delivered tothe
same officer at different times to be served, he shall serve them in
the order in which he receives them and wh .. n they are delivered at

by himself, or some person for him, with one or more sufficient securities, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay the defendant all
darnazes he may sustain by reason of the arrest, should it thereafter
appea0rthat the order was wrongfully obtained.

32. Upon the delivery of the bond mentioned in the preceding
section, the clerk shall issue an order for the arrest of the defendant
in form or in substance as follows :
"A--
B--.

and commit him to the jail of the said county of--,
to be there safely kept, unless or until he shaJl give a hood, with
good security; in the penalty of -dol1ars, conditioned according
to law, and that yon return your proceedings under this order to the
next term of the circuit court of said county. Witness
E---F

, Clerk."

33. Under such order, the defendant against whom it issues shall
be arrested and committed to jail, unless bond be given in the sum
specified therein, with sufficient security, that in case there shall in
the action or suit be any judgment, decree or order ()D which a writÂ·
of .fieri facias may issue, and within four months after such judgment, decree, or order is rendered or made, interrogatories be filed .
under the fourth section of chapter one hundred and forty-one, with
a commissioner of the court wherein such judgment, decree, or order is, the defendant will, at the time the commissioner issues a summons to answer such interrogatories, be in the county in which such
commissioner may reside, and will, within the time prescribed in
such summons, file proper answers upon oath to such interrogatories, and make such conveyance and delivery as is required by the
said chapter, or in case of failure to file such answer and make such
conveyance and delivery, that the said defendant will perform and
satisfy the said judgment, decree or order.

34. The defendant arrested under such order may, at any time
pending the case, give bond to the officer making theÂ· arrest. Such
bond shall be taken by said officer and returned by him to the clerk
of the court from which the order issued, and the same shall be filed
in said clerk's office.

35. If the defendant gives such bond, or be committed to jail for
want of it, the court in which the case is pending, or the judge thereof in vacation, may, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, or bis
attorney or counsel, quash the order and discharge the defendant
from custody, or discharge the bond on being satisfied that the same
was wrongfully obtained ; and, whether the order was so obtained
or not, may discharge him from custody when the plaintiff is cast in
the action or suit.

36. Whi1e a defendant is in custody, whether under an arrest
made heretofore or hereafter, the plaintiff', without having a judgment against the defendant, may file interrogatories to him in like
manner as might be done under the fourth section of chapter one
hundred and forty-one, if such judgment had been obtained and a
fieri facias thereon delivered to an officer. And the court wherein
the case is pending, or a judge or a commissioner thereof.-after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, or his attorney or counsel, may discharge the defendant from custody, unless interrogatories be filed
within such time as the said court, judge or commissioner may deem
reasonable; or, though interrogatories be filed, ruay discharge him
when proper answers thereto are filed and proper conveyance and
delivery made.

37. The officer making the arrest shall be the officer to whom the
-conveyance shall be made. The interrogatories, answers and report
of the commissioner shall be returned to the court in which the case
is pending, and filed in the p,apers of such case. And the said court
may make such order as it may deem right as to the sale and proper
application of the estate conveyed and delivered under the preceding
section,

2. All acts and parts of acts coming within the purview of this
act, and inconsistent therewith, are hereby repealed.

1. A defendant in an action brought against him for the recovery
of money, which he does not wish to defend, but which money is
claimed by a third person, or for the recovery of the possession of
personal property to which he makes no claim, but which is claimed
by a third person, may file his affidavit stating the facts in relation
thereto, and that he does not collude with such third party, but is
ready to pay the money claimed, or deliver- the property to the
owner thereof, as the court may direct, the court may thereupon,
make an order requiring such third party to appear and state the
nature of bis claim, and maintain or relinquish the same, and in the
meantime stay the proceedings in such action. If such third party
on being served with a copy of such order, shall not. appear, the court
may, on proof of the plaintiff's right, render judgment for him, and
declare such third party to be forever barred of any claim in respect
of the subject-matter, either against the plaintiff, or the original defendant, or his personal representative.
If such third party, on being so served, shall appear, the court shall allow him to make himself defendant in the action, and, either in said action or otherwise,
cause such issue or issues to be tried as it may prescribe, and may direct which party shall be considered the plaintiff in the issues; and
shall give judgment upon the verdict rendered, or, if a jury be
waived by the parties interested, shall determine their claims in a
summary way. The court may also make such order for the disposition of the money or property which is the subject-matter of the
action, pending the same, as to it may seem proper.

2. If any officer levy or is required to levy an execution er a warrant of distress on property, and a doubt shall arise whether the said
property is liable to such levy, he may give to the plaintiff, his agent,
or attorney at law, notice that an indemnifying bond is required in
the case. Bond may thereupon be given by any person, with good
security, payable to the officer, in a penalty equal to double the value
of the property, conditioned to indemnify him against all damages
which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of said
property, and to any claimant of said property all damages which
he may sustain in consequence of such seizure or sale; and also to
warrant and defend, to any purchaser of the property, such estate or
interest therein as is sold.

3. H such bond be not given within a reasonable time after such
notice, the officer may refuse to levy on such property, or restore it
to the person from whose possession it was taken, as the case may
be. If it be given, where there has been no levy, within a reasonable time, or after a levy, before the property is so restored, it shall
be returned within twenty days to the clerk's office of the circuit
court of the county in which such property may be and the claimant or purchaser of such property shall, after such bond is so returned, he barred of any action against the officer levying thereon,
provided the security therein be good at the time of taking it.
SUSPENDING BO.SD, .ETC:.

4. But the sale of any such property shall be suspended at the
instance of any claimant thereof who shall deliver to the officer
bond, with good security, in a penalty equal to double the value
thereof, payable to said officer, conditioned to pay to all persons who
may be injured by suspending the sale thereof, until the claim thereto can be adjusted, such damages as they may sustain by such suspension. Upon any such bond as is mentioned in this or the preceding section, suit may be prosecuted in the name of the officer,
for the benefit of the claimant, creditor, purchaser, or other person
injured, and such damages recovered in said snit as a jury may assess.
The same may be prosecuted, and execution had, in the name of such
officer when he is dead, in like manner as if he were alive.

5. When the property of the value of more than fifty dollars is
taken under a warrant of distress, or when property of any value is
taken under an execution issued by the clerk of a court, and any
person other than the party against whom the process issued, claims
such property, or the proceeds or value thereof, the circuit court of
the county in which the property is taken, or the judge thereof in
vacation, upon the application of the officer, where no indemifying
bond has been given, or if one has been given, on the application of
the person who claims such property and has given such suspending
bond as is mentioned in the next preceding section, may cause to appear before such court, as well the party issuing such process, as the
party making such claim; and such court may exercise, for the decision of their rights, all or any of the powers and authority prescribed in the first section of this chapter.

6. Such court; on the application of the party issuing said process, may cause to appear before it the party making such claim,
and may exercise the like powers and authority. In such case as
is mentioned in this or the preceding section, the court, where no
bond is given for the forthcoming of the property, or the judge
thereof in vacation, may, before a decision of the rights of the parties, make an order for the sale of the property, or any part thereof,
on such terms as the court or judge may deem advisable, and for
the proper application of the proceeds according to the said rights.
In any case before mentioned in this chapter, the court may make
all such rules and orders, and enter suchjudgment as to costs and all
other matters, as may be just and proper.

7. The sheriff or other officer levying a writ of fieri faeias or distress warrant on property, the sale of which is suspended under this
chapter at the instance of a claimant thereof, may, it such claimant
desire the property to remain in such possession as it was immediately before the levy, and if the case be one in which a bond for the
forthcoming of the property is not prohibited from being taken from
the debtor by the seventh section of chapter one hundred and fortytwo of this code, take from the claimant a bond, with sufficient
surety, payable to the creditor, with such recital as is required in a
bond taken from the debtor and with condition that the propertl
shall be forthcoming at such day and place of sale as may be therea ter lawfully appointed, whereupon, such property may be permitted
to remain at the risk of such claimant in such possession as it was
immediately before the levy; and the provisions of the said chapter
shall apply to such u bond in like manner as to a bond taken from
the debtor.

8. When property, the sale of which is indemnified, sells for more
than enough to satisfy the execution or distress warrant under which
it is taken, the surplus shall be paid by the officer into the court to
the office whereof the indemnifying bond is required to he returned
or as such court may direct. The said court may make such order
for the disposition thereof, either temporarily until the question as
to the title of the property sold is determined, or absolutely, as in
respect to the rights of those interested may seem to it proper.

1. Persons desiring to end any controversy, whether there he a
suit pending therefor or not, may submit the same to arbitration,
and agree that- such submission may he entered of record in any
court. Upon proof of such agreement out o( court, or by consent
of the parties given in court, in person or by counsel, it shall he entered in the proceedings of such court ; and thereupon a rule shall
be made, that the parties shall submit to the award which shall be
made in pursuance of such agreement. And when a pending
cause is submitted to arbitration, the defendant may make any
defense to the plaintiff's claim or demand, that he could make under
any proper plea filed in court, whether such plea has been tiled or
not, by giving to the plaintiff reasonable notice in writing of the
nature and character of his defense; and in a suit for any debt he
may at the trial before the arbitrators, proye and have allowed
against such debt, any payment or set-off, whether before that time
pleaded or not, or whether an account of set-off has before that time
been filed or not, which he may plead or file before the arbitrators
in such manner as to give the plaintiff notice of its nature, but not
otherwise. Although the claim of the plaintiff be jointly against
several persons and the set-off is of a debt, not to all, but only to a
part of them, this section shall extend to such set-off, if it appear
that the persons against whom such claim is, stand in the relation of
principal and surety, and the person entitled to the set-off is the
principal. And when the defendant is allowed to file and prove an
account of set- off' to the plaintiff's demand, the plaintiff shall be al ..
lowed to file and prove an account of counter set-off, and make such
other defense as he might have made had an original action been
brought npon such set-off; and upon the trial the arbitrators shall
ascertain the true state of indebtedness between the parties, and the
award shall be rendered accordingly.

2. Xo such submission, entered or agreed to be entered, of record,
in any court, shall be revocable by any party to such submission,
without the leave of such court; and such court may, from time to
time, enlarge the term within which an award is required to be made.

3. Upon the return of any such award, made under such an agreement, ( whether any previous record of the submission or a rule thereupon has been made or not), it shall be entered up as the judgment
or decree of the court, unless good cause be shown against it at the
first term after the parties have been summoned to show cause against
it. And the court shall make to such arbitrators such reasonable
allowance for thci r services as it may deem proper, to be taxed in
the costs of the suit or proceeding, when no provision is made for
the pay of the arbitrators in the arbitration agreement, or to be otherwise paid as the court may direct.

4. No such award shaJI be set aside, except for errors apparent on
its face, unless it appears to have been procured by corruption or
other undue means, or by mistake, or that there was partiality or
misbehaviour in the arbitrators, or any of them. But this section
shall not be construed to take away the power of courts of equity
over a wards.

5. Any personal representative of a decedent, guardian of an infant, committee of an insane person, or trustee, may file his petition
in the circuit court of the county in which he qualified or was appointed, asking permission from such court to submit to arbitration
any suit or matter of controversy touching the estate or property of
such decedent, infant, insane person, or in respect to which he is trustee. In which petition shall be stated the facts upon which the petioner seeks the permission of the court; the court may in its discretion grant or refuse the prayer of the petition. If the petition is
filed in good faith, and the petition is granted by the court, an order
showing that permission to arbitrate was granted shall be entered
on the chancery order book of the court, and the award made in any
such case shall be binding upon all the parties in interest, and shall
be entered as the judgment of the court in the same manner as other
submissions and awards are entered, unless set aside by the court.
If the petition is filed in good faith and there was no fault or neglect on the part of the fiduciary, he shall not be responsible for any
loss sustained by an award adverse tc the interests of bis ward, insane person or beneficiary under any such trust.

2. All acts and parts of acts coming within the purview of this
act, and inconsistent with its provisions, are hereby repealed.

1. When a writ of mandamus is issued, the return thereto shall
state, plainly and concisely, the matter of law or fact relied on in opposition to the complaint.

2. The complainant may thereupon demur to the return, or plead
specially thereto, or both.

3. The defendant may reply to, take issue on, or demur to the
pleas of the complainant.

4. If a verdict be found, or a judgment be rendered for the person suing out the writ, on demurrer or by nil died, or for want of a
replication or other pleading, he shall recover his costs, and such
damages as the jury may assess, and final judgment thereupon shall
be entered and enforced hy execution, as in other cases; and a peremptory mandamus shall be awarded without delay as if the return
to the writ had been adjudged insufficient.

his costs.

Fourth, Against any person who shall intrude into or usurp any
public office. But no such writ shall be awarded or prosecuted
against any person now in office for any cause which would have
been available in support of a proceeding to contest the election of
such person to such office.

7. Whenever the attorney general or prosecuting attorney of any
county is satisfied that a ca .ise exists therefor he may, at his own instance, or at the relation of any pPrson interested apply by petition
to the circuit court of the county wherein the seat of government
is, or of the county wherein the cause for the issuing of such writ
arose, to have such writ issued, and shall state therein the reason
therefor. Whenever such writ is issued at the relation o( any person, the petition shall be to the circuit court of the county wherein
t:ho seat of government is, or of the county wherein the cause or Â¥iy
part thereof, for the issuing such writ arose, as the relaters may
.Iect.

8. If, in the opinion of the court, the reasons so stated in the petition are sufficient in law, it shall award the said writ and the same
shall be signed by the judge of such court and attested by the clerk
thereof. But if such writ be awarded at the relation of any person
it shall not be issued until the relator shall give bond.with good security, to be approved by the court, in such penalty as the court shall
prescribe, with condition that the relator will pay all such costs and
expem,es as may be incurred by the state in the prosecution of such
writ in case the same shall not be recovered from and paid by the
defendant therein.

the information he propo~es to file. If, in the opinion of such court,
the matters stated in such information are sufficient in law to authorize the same to be filed, an order shall be made filing the same
and awarding a summons against the defendant named therein to
answer such information. But if the leave to file such information
be asked on the relation of any person, or by any person at his own
instance, the summons thereon shall not be issued by the clerk until
such relater or person shall give the bond and security required by
the next preceding section. A copy of every such information, if

be made by publication as prescribed in said last named chapter.

11. If the defendant named in such writ or information, fail to
appear after the service thereof as aforesaid, the court may hear proof
of the allegations of the petition or information, and if such allegasions be sustained, the court shall give judgment accordingly. But
if the service be made by publication, the defendant against whom
such judgment is rendered, upon giving bond and security as provided in section eight of this chapter, may have the judgment against
him set aside, and make such defense as he or it may have thereto. If

shall be guilty as to such charges, and shall particularly specify the
same, and as to the residue of such charges the verdict shall be â¢'not
guilty." Against a defendant so found guilty, the court shall give

the party applying be directed to declare in prohibition, before writ
issued, the declaration shall be expressed to be on behalf of such
party only, and not on the behalf of the party and of the state, and
shall contain and set forth in a concise manner, so much only of the
proceeding as may be necessary to show the ground of the application, without alleging the delivery of a writ or any contempt, and
shall conclude by praying that a writ of prohibition may issue; to
which declaration the defendant may demur, or plead such matters,
by way of traverse, or otherwise, as mny be proper to show that the
writ ought not to issue, and conclude by praying that such writ mayÂ·
not issue; and judgment shall be given that the writ of prohibition
do or do not issue, as justice may require; and the party in whose
favor such judgment is given, whether on verdict or otherwise, shall
recover his costs; and in case a verdict shall be given for the plaintiff, the jury may assess damages, for which judgment shall also be

or order, removed thereby, or proceedings on such judgment or order, except in a criminal case, until the party applying therefor, or

the same by petition, showing by affidavit or other evidence, probable cause to believe that he is detained without lawful authority.

2. The writ shall be directed to the person in whose custody the
petitioner is detained, and made returnable as soon as may be before the court or judge ordering the same, or any other of the said

ADJO'l"R~ED TERMS.

4. If any term of a circuit court is about to end without dispatching all its business, the judge thereof may, by an order entered of
record, adjourn the holding of such court to any future day on which
he is not required by law to hold a court in some other county ; and
all causes on the docket of said court, and not otherwise disposed of,
shall stand continued to such adjourned day. The court may, in its
discretion, require the jury summoned to attend such term, to attend
as such on the adjourned day, or may require a new jury to be drawn
and summoned in the manner required by law; and all witnesses
summoned to attend in causes so continued to such adjourned term,
are required to attend said term without being again summoned.
All judgments, orders and decrees, rendered and made by such court
before or during the day on which said court adjourns to such future
day, as aforesaid, shall have the same force and effect in all respects
as if said court had finally adjourned on that day.

5. If any term of such court has ended without dispatching all
its business, or if there be a failure to hold any term, the judge of
the circuit may, by a warrant directed to the clerk, appoint a special
term thereof and prescribe in such warrant whether a grand or petit
jury is to be summoned to attend such term. The clerk shall enter
the warrant in the order book of the court and inform the prosecuting attorney and the sheriff of such appointment, post a copy of the
warrant at the door ot the court house, and issue all proper process
returnable to such special term ; and the sheriff shall execute such
process, and summon a grand or petit jury, or both, as may be prescribed in the warrant.

6. Whenever any judge of a circuit court shall have appointed a
special term of any circuit court in the manner directed by the preceding section, and shall afterwards ascertain that he cannot hold
the said special term on the day appointed for it, he may, by warrant under his hand, directed to the clerk of the court, adjourn it to
such other day as he may deem proper. Such warrant shall he transmitted by the judge to the clerk, who shall immediately enter the
said warrant in the order book of the court, and as to the said special
term thereafter to be held under the said continuance, proceed iu
all other respects in the manner directed by the section aforesaid.

7. Whenever th~ situation of a prisoner confined in jail for trial
in a circuit court makes it proper that his case should be disposed of
before the next regular term thereof, the judge of such court may
appoint a special term to be holden for the trial of the case, in the
same manner as if the same had stood for trial at the uext preceding
term, and the court had adjourned without disposing thereof.

8. Any cause, civil or criminal, and any motion or proceeding
ready for trial or bearing, may be tried, heard and determined at any
such special term, the same as if it were a regular ter.m of such court.
Every such special term may be held by the judge of the circuit,
or, if he be dead or absent, by nny other circuit judge who may be
present; and it may be held part of its session by one judge and
part by another; and such special terms may be adjourned from time
to time during the intervals between the regular terms as the judge
may deem necessary for the dispatch of the business of the court.

9. Each circuit judge, during his continuance in office, shall reside in the circuit for which he was elected.

10. All orders and decrees made by a judge out of court in a
cause pending in court shall he certified by him to the clerk of the
court in which the same is pending, and be entered by such clerk in
the proper order book.

11. When for any cause the judge of a circuit court shall fail to
attend and hold the same, tither at the commencement of the term,
whether regular, acijourned or special, or at any time before its adjournment; or if he be in attendance and cannot properly preside
at the trial of any cause therein, the attorneys present and practicing in said court may elect a judge by ballot to hold said court during the absence of the judge, or for the trial of the cause ih which
the judge of said court cannot preside. The clerk of the court shall
hold said election, declare the result thereof, and enter the same of
record. Provided, however, that the parties or their attorneys, in
any case in which the judge of the court cannot properly preside at
the trial thereof, may agree upon a judge to try or hear and determine the same, which agreement shall be entered of record in the
proper order book of the court, and in such case no election of a
judge to try or hear and determine the case shall be held. No person who is counsel or attorney in the case to which the disability of
the judge relates shall vote in the election of a judge to try the
same; nor shall any person who has not been admitted to practice as
an attorney in some court in this state be elected as such judge.
The judge so elected or agreed upon shall, before proceeding to act,
take an oath that he will faithfully and impartially perform the duties of u judge of such court so long as he shall continue to act as
such ; and, if he be elected or agreed upon to tr, or hear and determine a particular case as hereinbefore provided for, he shall take the
further oath that he is not interested as counsel or attorney, or otherwise, in the cause to be tried or heard and determined by him.

12. Every judge so elected or agreed upon shall have and possess
the same powers, and perform the same duties, in all respects, as the
regularly elected judge of such court, during the time he shall act in
pursuance of such election or agreement. If there be any cause
pending in such court, in the trial or hearing of which the judge
elected as aforesaid cannot properly preside, another judge for the
trial or hearing thereof may be elected or agreed upon as aforesaid.

13. The judge so elected or appointed shall receive tor his services, while sitting as such judge, ten dollars per day, to be certified
by the court and paid out of the state treasury. This and the two
next preceding sections shall apply as well to criminal as to civil
causes.

amended, on behalf of a party to a controversy in a county court,
such party may present to the circuit court of the county in which
the judgment, order or proceeding complained of was rendered,
made or had, or in the vacation of such court to any judge of a circuit court, the petition of such party for an appeal. Such petition
must be presented within one year after such judgment, order or
proceeding was rendered, had or made. With such petition there

court, and the petition shall assign errors. If the appeal be allowed,

A copy of the order of allowance shall be served npon the opposite
party, and upon proper return of such service and the execution of
the required bond the appeal shall be docketed and proceeded with
in the circuit court. If the petition be refused the refusal shall be
endorsed on the petition which may then be presented to a judge of
the court of appeals; if the matter be one in which an appeal would
be to that court from a judgment of the circuit court affirming the
action of the county court, such judge may in such case allow or refuse the appeal, and in case of allowance by him, the like proceedings shall be had as if the allowauce was by a circuit judge. After
the decision of the appeal by the circuit court the cause or matter
shall be remanded to the county court, or be retained in the circuit

and if any person whose name is so drawn is unable by reason of
sickness, absence from home, or other cause, to attend as a juror, his
name shall, at the conclusion of such draft, be returned into the box;
Qr if h~ is exempted by law, or his name has been struck from the
jury list, the ballot shall be destroyed, and another shall be drawn

the officers attending to draw jurors, and the ballots therein replaced
in the jury-box, from which drafts shall thereafter again be madeÂ·
in the manner herein prescribed.

14. Nothing contained in the preceding sections shall prevent

of its business, shall have power to discharge persons summoned as
jurors therein, or dispense with their attendance, on any day of its
sitting.

county, district, school district, or municipal corporation is interested, or is a party, no person shall be incompetent as a juror because he is an inhabitant or tax-payer of such county, district, school
district, or municipal corporation; Provided, however, that in any
case where a municipal corporation is interested, or is a party, the
court, upon motion of either party to the suit, made either on the
first day of the term of the court, or at any other time, not less than
five days before the day set for the trial, may order jurors to be summoned, none of whom are citizens or tax-payers of such municipal
corporation ; and if it be under circumstances requiring the issuing
of a venire faeias, the officers charged with the duty of drawing the
names from the box shall draw the number required, exclusive of
those who are known to be citizens or tax-payers of such municipal
corporation. Any court of limited jurisdiction heretofore established, or that may be hereafter established within any incorporated
city, town or village, shall have power in any such suit or proceeding, to require the summoning and attendance of jurors from the
county who are not citizens of the municipal corporation. Either
the sheriff of the county or the officer of such court who is authorized to execute its writs in other oases, may summon such
jurors.

18. No exception shall be allowed against a juror after he is
sworn upon the jury, on account of his age or other legal disability, unless by leave of court.

19. No irregularity in any writ of oenire facias, or in the drawing,
summoning, or impaneling of jurors, shall be sufficient to set aside
a verdict, unless the party making the objection was injured by the
irregularity, or unless the objection was made before the swearing of
the jury.

20. When by neglect or any of the duties required in this chapter to be performed by any of the officers or persons herein mentioned, the jurors to be returned shall not be duly drawn and summoned to attend the court, any person guilty of such neglect shall
pay a fine not exceeding twenty dollars, to be imposed by the court.

shall be ordered filed with the clerk of said court, and the court shall
appoint a day for the hearing of said petition and the examination
under oath of the parties in interest, not less than ten nor mw-e than
twenty days from the filing of the petition. Aud the court may adjourn the hearing of said petition or the examination of the parties
in interest from time to time, as the nature of the case way require;
and if it shall be necessary under the provisions of this act, that a
discreet and suitable person shall be appointed as the next friend to
to the child sought to be adopted, then and in that case the court
shall order a notice of the petition and of the time and the place
when and where the appointment of next friend will be wade, to be
published in some newspaper of general circulation in the county
where said court is located, once a week for four successive weeks;
and at the time and place RO named, and upon due proof of the publication of such notice, the court shall make such appointment,. and
shall thereupon assign a day for the hearing of said petition and examination of the parties interested, not more than twenty days from
the time of appointing the next friend, and upon the day so appointed the court shall proceed to a full hearing of the petition and
examination of the parties in interest, under oath; and if the court,
from the testimony, shall be of the opinion that the facts stated in
the petition are true, and if upon examination the court is satisfied
that the petitioner, or petitioners, is, or are of good moral character
and of respectable standing in the community, and of ability to properly maintain and educate the child sought to be adopted, and that
the best interests of the child would be promoted by such adoption,
then and in such a case, the court shall make a decree reciting the
facts at length and the name by which the child shall thereafter be
known; declaring and adjudging that from the date of such decree
the rights, duties, privileges and relations theretofore existing between the child and his or her parent or parents, shall be in all respects at an end, excepting the right of inheritance; and that the
rights, duties, privileges and relations between the child and his or
her parent or parents by adoption, shall thenceforth in all respects
be the same, including the right of inheritance, as if the child had
been born to such adopted parent or parents in lawful wedlock, except only as otherwise provided in this chapter. Petitions, decrees,
testimony and proceedings shall be recorded in a book kept for that
purpose, and the clerk shall receive the same fees as for the recording of a deed, and upon the entry of such decree of adoption, the
parents of the child if living, shall be divested of all legal rights
and obligations due from them to the child, or from the child to
them, and the child shall be free from all legal obligations of obedience
or otherwise to the parents, and the adopting parent or parents of theÂ·
child shall be invested with every legal right ii~ respect to obedience
and maintainance on the part of the child, as if said child had been
born to them in lawful wedlock; and the child shall be invested with
every legal right, privilege,ohligation and relation in respect to education, maintenance, and the rights of inheritance in the estate of such
adopting parent or parents, us if born to them in lawful wedlock; except that said child shall not be capable of taking property expressly
limited to the heirs of the body of the adopting parent or parents, nor
property coming from the collateral kindred of such adopting parent
or parents by rigut of' inheritance; Provided, that on the death of the
adopting parent or parents and the subsequent death of the child so
adopted, without issue, the property of such adopting deceased pa- .
rent or parents shall descend to and be distributed among the next
ot kindred of said parent or parents, and uot to the next of kin of
the adopted child. Provided, also, that if such adopting parent or
parents shell have other child or children, theirs by birth, then, and
in that case, the adopted child shall share the inheritance with the
child or children born to the adopting parent or parents, in which
case, he, she or they, shall respectively inherit from and through
each other as if all had been children of the same parents born in
lawful wedlock.

5. A parent or guardian of a minor, when a minor is adopted
under the provisions of this chapter, who had no notice of the proceedings, may, at any time within a year, after receiving notice, apply by petition to the circuit court in which the petition mentioned
in the second section was filed, praying that the adoption may be
vacated. The court applied to shall give notice of a hearing, and
shall bear the petitioner and all parties interested, and may vaeate or
affirm the adoption in its discretion. Any party interested may appeal from the decision of the said court in the matter, as in other
cases of appeals in matters of probate. If the person thus adopted
is adopted while a minor he may, within one year after becoming of
age, sign, seal and acknowledge before proper authority, in the
county in which the instrument of adoption was filed, a dissent
from such adoption. Such instrument of dissent shall be recorded
in such county court clerk's office, and upon the filing of the same
the adoption shall be void.

action, or any part thereof arose, although none of the defendants
may reside therein.

court of appeals, or a judge thereof in vacation,) shall be in the circuit court of the county in which the record or proceeding is, to
which the writ relates. Any such writ may be awarded either by
the circuit court or (in vacation) by the judge thereof.

code, shall not be directed to an officer of any other county than
that wherein the action is brought. Any process may be executed

as the court shall direct.

3. If at the return day of any process it be not returned execu-.
ted, an alias or other proper process may be issued without waiting
(where the first process is returnable to a term) for the subsequent

the first process against a defendant, any subsequent process is issued, if the former was executed, the officer shall not execute the
latter, but shaJl return the former if it is in his possession, and if he
has it uot, shall return the latter with an endorsement of the execution of the former, and the proceedings thereupon shall be as if the
first had been duly returned.

4. Every officer who attends a court shall, within five days after
the end of any rules, go to the clerk's office and receive a11 process,
orders and decrees to be executed by him and give receipts therefor. For any failure so to do he shall forfeit fifty dollars.

5. The procei;;s to co.mmcnce a suit shall be a writ commanding
the officer to whom it is directed, to summon the defendant to answer the bill or action. It shall be issued on the order of the plaintiff, or his attorney or agent, and shall not, after it is issued, be altered, nor any blank therein filled up, except by the clerk.

6. Any summons or scire facias against any person, including a
summons for a witness, may be served as a notice is served under
the first section of chapter one hundred and twenty-one of this code,
to which end the clerk issuing such process, unless otherwise directed, shall deliver or transmit therewith as many copies thereof as

it become final within thirty days after the service of such process.

7. It shall be sufficient to serve any process against or notice to
a corporation on its mayor, president or other chief officer, or any
person appointed pursuant to law to accept service of process for it,
or in his absence, from the county or municipal corporation, to the
officer of which the process is directed, it shall be sufficient to serve
the notice or process, if the corporation to be served be a city, town
or village, on two members of the council; and if it be not a city,
town or village, on the secretary, cashier, or treasurer, aud if there
be none such or he be absent, on a member of the board of trustees,
directors or visitors. If there be not within the state anv other
person on whom there can be service as aforesaid, service o~ a director, agent, (including in the case of a railroad company, a depot
or station agent in actual employment of the company), or
other officer of the corporation against which the case is shall be
sufficient.

8. It shall be sufficient service of any process on, or notice to a
corporation which shall have been formed, or which may be hereafter formed under, or which has accepted, or which may hereafter
accept, the provisions of chapter fifty-four of this code, and which,
within the time prescribed by the twenty-fourth section of said chapter, shall fail to comply with the said chapter, if a copy of such process or notice be delivered by a proper officer or person to any person at or in charge of its principal office or place of business; or
such corporation may be proceeded against by order of publication.

9. In a case against any common carrier ( other than a corporation) for any liability as such, it shall be sufficient to serve any process against or notice to the carrier, or any agent, or the driver,
captain or conductor of any vehicle of such carrier, and to publish a
copy of the process or notice as an order is published under the
twelfth section of this chapter.

10. No jndgment sha11 be rendered on a scire faeias, or in any
other case, on returns of nihil.

11. On affidavit that a defendant is not a resident of this state;
or that diligence has been used by or on behalf of the plaintiff to
ascertain in what county he is, without effect; or that proces~, directed to the officer of the county in which he resides or is, has been
twice delivered to such officer more than ten days before the return
day, and been returned without being executed ; or that the defendant is a corporation, and that no person can be found iu the county
upon whom the process can be legally served; an order of publication may be entered against such deiendant. And in any suit in
equity, where the bill states that the names of any persons interested
in the subject to be divided or disposed of are unknown, and makes
such persons defendants by the general description of parties unknown, on affidavit of the fact that the said names are unknown, an
order of publication may be entered against such unknown parties.
Any order under this section may be entered either in court or at the
rules. In a proceeding by petition, there may be an order of publication in like manner as in a suit in equity.

12. Every order of publication shall state briefly the object of the
suit, and require the defend. mts ugaiust whom it is entered, or the .
unknown parties to appear within one month after the date of the
first publication thereof, and do what is necessary to protect their interests. It shall be published once a week for four successive weeks,
in some newspaper published in the county in which the order is
made or directed, if one ii; so published, unless the circuit court of
such county otherwise order; and if no newspaper be published in
the county, then in such other newspaper as the court may prescribe;
or if none be so prescribed, as the clerk may direct. It shall be
deemed to have beeu duly published 011 the day of the fourth publication thereof. It shall also be posted at the front door of the court
house of the county wherein the court is held, at least twenty days
before judgment or decree is rendered,

13. When such order shall have been so posted and published, if
the defendants against whom it is entered, or the unknown parties,
shall not appear at the next term of the court, after such publication
is completed, the case may be tried or heard as to them. Personal
service of a summons, seire faeias, or notice may be made on a nonresident defendant. out of this state, which service shall have the
same effect, and no other, as an order of publication, duly posted and
published against him. In such case the return must be made under oath, and must show the time and place of such service, and that
the defendant so served is a non-resident of this state. Upou any
trial or hearing under th is section, such judgment, decree or order
shall be entered as may appear just.

14. Any unknown party or other defendant;who was not served
with process in this state, and did not appear in the case before the
date of such judgment, decree or order, or the representative of
such, may, within five years trom that date, if he be not served with
a copy of such judgment, decree or order, more than one year before the end of said five years, and if he was so served, then within
one year from the time of such service, file his petition to have the
proceedings reheard in the manner and form provided by section
twenty-five of chapter one hundred and six of this code, and not
otherwise; and all the provisions of that section are hereby made app.icable to proceedings under this section.

15. (Acts 1883, p. 69.) When, by the return of any officer of process issued to answer any appeal or supersedeas now pending or which
may be hereafter pending in the supreme court of appeals in this
state, or when, from affidavits filed with the clerk of the said court,
it shall appear that the appellee or defendant in any such appeal or
supcrsedeas is a non-resident of this state, or that the names or places
of residence of such parties are unknown, so that process cannot be
served upon them, where such service may be necessary, it shall be
lawful for thP clerk of said court, upon application, to take and issue,
on the first Monday in any month, an order of publication against
such absent or unknown parries, requiring them to appear on acertain day, to be dcsignuted in said order, then and there to answer
the said appeal or supereedeas and to have a rehearing of the whole
matter therein contained.

16. (ih.) Snch order or publication shall be entered by the clerk
in a suitable book kept by him for the purpose and signed by him,
and a certified copy of such order shall be inserted once a week for
t'our !-tHcei\'e weeks in some newspaper to 1'e named therein, and a
eopy of ~a4d order shall be posted at the front door of the building
in which said court is held in th .. grand division in which the cause
is to be heard ; and when it shall appear that said order of publication has been duly published and posted as aforesaid, the court may
proceed to hear and decide such cause in the same manner as if the
said parties had been personally served with process : Provided,
houeeer, That the order of publication shall have been executed, as
aforesaid, at least thirty days before the day on which any such cause
may be called for hearing.

17. Any unknown party or other defendant who was not served
with process in this state, and did not. appear in the cause, may
have the same reheard, and any injustice in the proceedings corrected within the time prescribed by the fourteenth section of this
chapter.

2. All acts and parts of acts coming within the purview of this
act, and inconsistent therewith, are hereby repealed.

1. In the clerk's office of every circuit court, except where a different provision is made by law, rules shall be held on the first Monday of every month, except when a term of the circuit court happens to commence on the first Monday in a month, or either of the
two following clays, or on the preceding Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday or Saturday, the rules which otherwise would
have been held for the said month on the first Monday, shall be
held on last Monday in the next preceding month. The rules may
continue three days; but when in any case such continuance would
interfere with the terms of the court for which the rules are held,
they shall not continue in such case beyond the day preceding the
commencement of the term of such court.

2. Where rules are held on the last Monday in a month, as provided in the preceding section, they shall be entered in the rule
docket and endorsed on the declaration or bill as if taken on the first
Monday in the month to which they relate.

3. There shall be a docket of the cases at rules, wherein the rules
shall be entered; and t.he books in which rules and orders are entered, in chancery cases, shall be separate from those in which rules
and orders .are entered in other cases.

4. When there is no clerk to take a rule in a case, it shall stand
continued until the next rule day after there is a clerk. â¢

5. The rules may be to declare, plead, reply, rejoin or for other
proceedings; they shall be given from month to month.
WHEN THE SUIT WILL ABATE OR BE DISMISSED.

6. A defendant may appear at the rule day at which the process
against him is returnable, or if it be returnable in term, at the first
rule day after the return day, and if the declaration or bill be not
then filed, may give a rule for the plaintiff to file the same. If the
plaintiff fail to do this at the succeeding rule day, or shall, at any
time after the defendant's appearance, fail to prosecute his suit, he
shall be non-suited, and pay to the defendant, besides his cost, five
dollars.

7. If three months elapse after the process is returned executed as
to any one or more of the defendants, without the dec]aration or bill
being filed, the clerk shall enter the suit dismissed, although none of
the defendants may have appeared.

8. When a summons to answer an action or bill is against a deÂ·
fendant whom the officer (receiving it) knows not to reside in his
county, or to reside out of the state, he shall, unless he find him in
his county on or before the return day, return him a non-resident;
whereupon, if the court from which such procesR issued have jurisdiction of the case only on the ground of such defendant's residence
in such county, the action or suit shall abate as to him; and if he
be returned a non-resident of the state, and the court have jurisdiction of the case only on the ground that the cause of action arose in
the county, the action or suit shal1 abate as to him.

9. No action shall abate for want of form, where the declaration
sets forth sufficient matter of substance for the court to proceed upon
the merits of the case.

10. In action of trespass, general avermeuts that the defendant
committed other wrongs, and that the acts charged were done with
force and arms against the peace, may be omitted; and the plaintiff may prove all that he could have done if such avermeuts had
been inserted in the declaration.

11. In every action of assumpsit the plaintiff shall file with his
declaration an account stating distinctly the several items of his
claim, unless it he plainly described in the declaration, and if he fail
to do so, he shall not be permitted to prove u.ny item not stated in
such account, on the trial of the case.

12. The plaintiff may of right amend his declaration or bill at
any time before the appearance of the defendant, or after such appearance if substantial justice will be promoted thereby. But if
such amendment be made after the appearance of the defendant, the
court may impose such terms upon the plaintiff as to a continuance
of the cause, and the payment of the costs of such continuance, as
it may deem just. The plaintiff may also at any time before or
after the appearance ot the defendant, in the vacation of the court
wherein the suit is pending, file in the clerk's office, with the other
papers in the cause, an amended declaration or bill, supplemental
bill, or bill of revivor; whereupon the clerk shall issue a summons
against the defendant, requiring him to plead to, or answer such
amended declaration or bill. But if the court shall be of opinion
that the same was improperly filed, it shall dismiss such declaration
or bill at the costs of the plaintiff'.

13. The proceedings in a suit, wherein an infant or insane person
is a party, shall not be stayed because of such infancy or insanity, but
the court in which the suit is pending, or the clerk thereof at mies,
may appoint a guardian ad /item to any infant or insane defendant,
whether such defendant shall have been served with process or not,
and after such appointment no process need be served on such infant
or insane person. The court may compel the person so appointed to
act, or appoint another in his stead; but the person so appointed
shall not be liable for costs, and shall be allowed his reasonable
charges, which the party on whose motion he was appointed shall
pay.

14. No plea in abatement for a misnomer shall be allowed in any
action; but in a case wherein, but for this section, a misnomer would
have been pleadable in abatement, the declaration and summons
may, on the motion of either party, and on the affidavit of the right
name, he amended by inserting the same therein.

15. In other cases, the defendant on whom the process summoning him to answer appears to have been served, shall not take advantage of any defect in the writ or return, or any variance in the
writ from the declaration, unless the same be pleaded in abatement.
And in every such case the court may permit the plaintiff to amend
the writ or declaration so as to correct the variance, and permit the return to be amended, upon such terms as to it shall seem just.

16. Where the declaration or hill shows on its face proper matter
for the jurisdiction of the court, no exception for the want of snch
jurisdiction shall be allowed, unless it be taken by plea in abate ..
ment; and the plea shall not be received after the defendant has
pleaded in bar, or answered to the declaration or bill, after a
rule to plead, or a conditional judgment or decree uiei.

17. No plea in abatement, for the non-joinder of any person as a
co-defendant, shall be allowed in any action, unless it be stated in the
plea that such person is a resident of the state, and unless the place
of residence of such person be stated with convenient certainty in an
affidavit verifying the plea.

18. If a defendant plead in abatement that any other person ought
to be jointly sued, and at the trial of an issue joined on such plea, it
appear that the action could not, by reason of ehapter ninety-eight,
or chapter one hundred and four of this code, be maintained against
'such other persons, or any of them, such issue shall be found against
the defendant so pleading.

19. AfterÂ· such plea in abatement, the plaintiff', without proceeding
to trial upon an issue thereon, may amend his declaration, and make
the persons named in such plea as joint contractors, defendants in
the case with the original defendants, and cause process to be served
upon the new detendants; and, if it appear by the subsequent pleadings in the action, or at the trial thereof, that all of the original defondants are liable, but that one or more of the other persons named
in such plea are not liable, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment,
or to verdict and judgment, as the case may be, against the defendants who appear liable; and such as are not liable shall have judgment, and recover costs as against the plaintiff, who shall be allowed
the same as costs against the defendants who so pleaded.

20. The defendant in any action or suit may plead as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he shall think necessary, except that if he plead the plea of non esifaclum he shall not, without
leave of the court, be permitted to plead any other plea inconsistent
therewith.
Tu any special plea, pleaded by a defendant, the plaintiff may plead as many special replications as he may deem necessary.

21. The defendant may plead in abatement and in bar at the
same time, but the issue on the plea in abatement shall be first tried.
And if such issue be found against the defendant, he may, nevertheless, make any other defense he may have to the action.

22. In a plea, replication, or subsequent pleading, intended to be
pleaded in bar, or in the maintenance of the action, it shall not be
necessary to use auy al legation of aeiionem. non or piÂ·ecludi non, or to
the like effect, or any prayer of judgment.

23. No party shall be prejudiced by omitting a protestation in any
pleading.

24. All special traverses, or traverses with an inducement of affirmative matter, shall conclude to the country. But this regulation
shall not preclude the opposite party from pleading over to the inducement when the traverse is immaterial.

25. When the plaintiff takes issue on the defendant's pleading, or
traverses the same, or demurs, so that the defendant is not let in to
allege any new matter, the plaintift may proceed as if there were a
similiter or joinder in demurrer.

26. No formal defense shall be required in a plea; it may commence as follows : " The defendant savs that."

27. It shall not be necessary to state in a second or other plea,
that it is pleaded by leave of the court, or according to the form of
the statute, or to that effect.

28. The form of a demurrer or joinder in demurrer shall be:
" The defendant (or plaintiff) says that the declaration (or plea,
etc.,) is not (or is) sufficient in law."

29. On a demurrer (unless it be to a plea in abatement.) the court
shall not regard any defect or imperfection in the declaration or
pleadings, whether it has heretofore been deemed mispleading or insufficient pleading or not, unless there be omitted something so essential to the action or defense that judgment according to law and
the very rigbt of the cause cannot be given. No demurrer shall be Â·
. sustained because of the omission in any pleading of the words, "this
heÂ· is ready to verify," or, "this he is ready to verify by the record,"
or "ns appears by the record;" but the oppos ite party may be excused from replying, demurring or otherwise answering to any
pleading which ought to have, but has not such words therein, until
they be inserted. If nothing be alleged by the <lemurrant in support of his demurrer the court, if it overrule the same, shall state
that fact in the order; and if final judgment be obtained in the cause
by the party whose pleading is demurred to, the same shall not be
reversed by reason of any defect in the pleading so demurred to.

30. A plaintiff in equity may have any plea or demurrer set down
to be argned. If the same be overruled, no other plea or demurrer
shall afterwards be received, but there shall be a rule upon the defendant to answer the bill ; and if he tail to' appear and answer the
bill on the day specified in the order, the plaintiff shall be entitled
to a decree against him for the relief prayed for therein.

31. A plaintiff in equity may take issue upon a plea, and have
such issue tried by a jury.

32. It shall not be necssary in any declaration or other pleading to
set forth the place in which any contract was made, or act done, unless
when, from the nature of the case, the place is material or traversable,
and then the allegation may be as to a deed, note, or other writing
bearing date at any place, that it was made at such place, or as to
any other act, according to the fact, without averring or suggesting that it was at or in the county in which the action is brought,
unless 'it was in fact therein.

33. It shall not be necessary in any action to aver that the cause
of action arose or that the matter is within the jurisdiction of the
court, or to make profert of any deed, letters testamentary, or commission of administration ; but a defendant may have oyer in like
manner as if proferr were made.

34. All allegations which are not traversable, and which the party
could not be required to prove, may be omitted, unless when they
are required for the right understanding of allegations that are material.
GENERAL RULES AS TO PLEADINGS AND PROCEEDINGS IN EQUITY.

35. The defendant in a suit in equity may, in his answer, allege
any new matter constituting a claim for affirmative reliet in such suit
against the plaintiff or any defendant therein, in the same manner
and with like effect as if the same had been alleged in a cross-bill
filed by him therein; and in such case, if the plaintiff or defendant
against whom such relief is claimed desire to controvert the relief
prayed for in the answer, he shall file a special reply in writing, denying such allegations of the said answer as he does not admit to be
true, and stating amÂ· facts constituting a defense thereto. But in
case a defendant all;ge new matter in his answer upon which he relies for and pra)S affirmative relief, such defendant shall not file a
cross-bill in the same cause except upon condition of striking from
his answer all such matter and prayer for affirmative relief as are
contained in such cross-bill.
.36. Every material allegation of the bill not controverted by an
answer, and e,Â·ery material allegation of new matter in the answer
constituting a claim for affirmative relief not controverted by a special reply in writing, shall for the purposes of the suit, be taken as
true, and no proof thereof shall be required.

37. The plaintiff's bill may be in form or in substance as follows:
"The bill of complaint of A-B-(state the names of all
the plaintiffs) against C--D-(state the names of all the defendants, if known, and if not, designate them as the 'unknown parties,' or 'unknown heirs,' etc., as the case may be,) filed in the circuit court of--county. The plaintiff complains and says that
(here state all the facts constituting a claim to relief.) The said
plaintiff therefore prays that (here state the particular relief desired.)
He also asks such other and general relief as the court may see fit to
grant.
A-B--,
Plaintiff."
Every person designated in the caption of such bill as a de ...
fendant shall be a defendant therein, without a prayer that he
be made such and shall be required to answer the bill in the
same manner and to the same extent as if he were therein called upon to do so.

38. If the plaintiff desire the defendant to answer the bill on oath
he must verify his hill by affidavit, and if the bill be so verified, the
defendant must in like manner verify his answer. But if the bill
be not verified, the defendant need not verify his answer, and if he
does 80 it shall not be entitled to any more weight in the cause than
if it had not been verified. lo case the defendant verify his answer,
alleging new matter constituting a claim for affirmative relief, the
plaintiff must verify his special reply thereto. A general replication to an answer claiming affirmative re.ief shall not apply to so
much of said answer as states facts constituting a claim to such
relief.

39. No plea in abatement or plea of non estfaeium shall be received
unless it be verified by affidavit.

40. Where a declaration or other pleading alleges that any person made, endorsed, assigned or accepted any writing, no proof of
the handwriting of such person shall be required, unless the fact be
denied by an affidavit with the plea which puts it in issue.

41. Where plaintiffs or defendants sue or are sued as partners,
and their names are set forth in the declaration or bill, or where a
plaintiff or defendant sues or is sued as a corporation, it shall not
be necessary to prove the fact ofsuch partnership or the existence of
such corporation, unless the pleading which puts the matter in issue
be verified, or there be an affidavit filed therewith denying such
partnership or the existence of such corporation. A plea putting in
issue the existence of a corporation shall be sufficient if it be in form
or effect as follows:
"And the said defendant for plea says, that the plaintiff (or defendant, as the case may be,) is not a corporation as in the plaintiff's
declaration is alleged."

42. The verification of any pleading, and the certificate thereof,
may be in form or effect as follows :
"State of West Virginia,
county, to-wit:
A-B--,
the plaintiff (or defendant, as the case may be,)
named in the foregoing bill, (or answer, replication, or plea as the
; case may be.) being duly sworn, says that the facts and allegations
therein contained are true, except so far as they are therein stated to
be on information, and that so far as they are therein stated to be
upon information he believes them to be true.
A-B--, plaintiff or defendant.
Taken, sworn to and subscribed before me this - day of--.
C
B
, clerk, (or other officers swearing him.)
If the party required to verify a pleading be an administrator or
other fiduciary, it shall be sufficient if he swear that he believes the
plea or other pleading to be true. A bill of injunction to be sworn
to by any person other than the plaintiff, or answer to a bill of injunction to be sworn to by a person other than the defendant making the answer, must be 80 drawn as to show which of the allegations therein contained are made on information and belief, and the
verification thereof must be in form or effect es follows:
"State of ,vest Virginia,
county, to-wit :
A
B---,
being duly sworn says, that he is the agent (or
at.torney, &c., as the case may he,) of the plaintiff named in the foregoing bill, or of the defendant named in the foregoing answer, and
that he knows the contents thereof; that the facts and allegations
therein contained are true except such as are therein stated upon
information and belief, and that as to such allegations he believes
them to be true.
C--D---:---, aqen! (or attorney.)"

43. In any suit a defendant may, in the vacation of the court,
confess a judgment or decree in the clerk's office, for so much principal and interest as the plaintiff may be willing to accept a judgment or decree for. The same shall be entered of record by the clerk
in the order book, and be as final and as valid as if entered in court
on the day of such confession, except merely that the court shall
have such control over it as is given by section sixty of this chapter.

44. If a defendant who appears fail to plead, answer or demur to
the declaration or bill, a rule may be given him to plead. If he fail
to appear at the rule day at which the process against him is returned executed, or when it is returnable to a term, at the first rule
day after it is so returned, the plaintiff, if he has filed his declaration or bill, may have a conditional judgment or decree niBi as to
such defendant. No service of such decree niei or conditional judgment shall be necessary. But at the next rule day after the same is
entered, if the defendant continue in default, or at the expiration of
any rule upon him with which he fails to comply, if the case be in
equity, the bill shall be entered as taken for confessed as to him,
and if it be at law judgment shall be entered against him, with an or-
der for the damages to be enquired into, when such enquiry is proper.

45. There need be no such enquiry in an action for debt npon BDY,
bond or other writing for the payment of money, or against the
drawer or endorsers of a bill of exchange or negotiable note or in an
action of debt or eeire faeias upon a judgment or recognizance.

46. Every judgment entered in the clerk's office in a case wherein
there is no order for an. enquiry of damages, and every non-suit or
dismission entered therein, shall, if not previously set aside, become
a final judgment of the last day of the next succeeding term of th~
court wherein the action, is pending. I~ the action in which such
judgment is entered be one for the recovery of money arising out
of contract and the plaintiff has filed with his declaration (whichin
all such cases he may do) an affidavit stating. that there is, as he
verily believes, due and unpaid from the defendant to him upon the
demand or demands stated in the declaration, including principal"
and interest, after deducting all payments, credits and sets-off made
by the defendant, and to which he is entitled, a sum certain to be
named in the affidavit, no plea shall be filed in the case either
at ru les or in court, unless the defendant shall file with the plea
his affidavit that there is not, us he verily believes, any sum due
from him to the plaintiff' upon the demand or demands stated in the
plaintiff's declaration, or stating a sum certain less than that stated
in the affidavit of the plaintiff, which, as he verily believes, is Â·all
that is due from him to the plaintiff upon the demand or demands stated in the plaintiff's declaration. If such plea and affidavit be not filed judgment shall he entered for the plaintiff' by the
court for the sum stated in his affidavit, with interest thereon from
the <late of the affidavit till paid. And if such plea and affidavit be
filed hy the defendant and it be admitted in such affidavit that any
such sum is due from the defendant to the plaintiff, judgment may
be taken by the plaintiff for the sum so admitted to be due, with interest thereon from the date of the plaintiff' 's affidavit till paid, and:
the case tried as to the residue. If the plaintiff nus not filed such:
affidavit with his declaration; and the office judgment in the case
be nut set aside, the judgment shall not be entered by the court until the plaintiff files such affidavit or proves his ease in open court,
and the judgment in either case shall be entered as heretofore provided for. If the case be one arising out of con truet in which there
is an order for an enquiry or damages, and the plaintiff has filed
with his declaration the affidavit hereinbefore mentioned, no plea
shall be filed in the cuse either at rules or in court, unless the defen ..
dant shall file therewith the affidavit hereinbefore required to set
aside an office judgment in which no order for an enquiry of damages had been made. When a jury is impaneled to execute an order for an enquiry of damages their oath shall be that they will well
and truly find the amount, if .any, which the plaintiff is entitled to
recover in the action, and a true verdict render according to the evidence. And the affidavit of the plaintiff" hereinbcfore mentioned
shall be legal evidence on such enquiry.

47. If a defendant against whom a judgment is entered in the
office, whether an order for an enquiry of damages has been made
therein or not, shall, before the end of the term at which it becomes
final, appear and plead to issue, and shall, in the cases mentioned in
the next preceding section in which an affidavit is required, file such
affidavit with his plea, the judgment shall be set aside, but if the
judgment has been entered up in court or the order for an enquiry of
damages has been executed, it shall not be s~t aside without good
cause be shown therefor.
Any such issue may be tried at the same
term, unless the defendant show by affidavit, filed with the papers,
good cause for a continuance. But the plaintiff shall have the right
to cross-examine the defendant upon the matters contained in such
affi.rl a vit,

48. Although a bill be taken for confessed as to any defendant,
the plaintiff' may have an attachment against him, or an order for
him to be brought in to answer interrogatories.
No plea or demurrer shall be received after such attachment, unless by order of
court, upon motion.

49. If a defendant, after process of contempt, put in an answer
which is adjudged insufficient, the plaintiff may go on with the subsequent process of contempt, as if no answer had been filed, or, at the
option of the plaintiff', if the bill be verified, the court may thereupon render such decree in the case as may be just.

50. A plaintiff in equity may, at or after the rule day at which
the bill ia taken for confessed as to any defendant, or at which his
answer is filed, have the cause set for hearing &8 to such defendant;
and it may he so set for hearing on the answer, or upon a geueral
replication thereto, as the plaintiff may prefer. If two months
elapse after the answer of a defendant is filed, without the case being
so set and without exceptions being filed to his answer, he may have
the case set for hearing as to himself.

51. If a snit in equity he set for hearing as to any defendant, it
shall be heard as to him, unless his interests be so connected with
those of other defendants in the suit, that it would he improper to
decide upon their interests separately. And though there be such
eouneetion, a defendant as to whom the ease bas been set for hearing
may have an order upon the plaintiff to use due diligence to mature
the cause for hearing as to the other defendants, and, unless it be so
matured within such time as the court may deem reasonable, shall
be entitled to a bearing or dismission of it as to him.

52. Where, in an action or suit against two or more defendants,
tbe proces~ is served upon part of them, the plaintiff may proceed
to judgment as to any so served, and either discontinue it as to the
others, or from time to time, as the process is served as to such others, proceed to judgment as to them until judgments be obtained
against all.

53. At any time before final decree a defendant may file his answer, but a cause shall not be sent to the rules or continued, because
an answer is filed in it, unless good cause be shown by affidavit, filed
with the papers therefor.

54. When a plaintiff in equity files exceptions to an answer, the
exceptions shall at once be set for argument.

55. When exceptions to an answer have been sustained, if the defendant pnt in a second answer, which is adjudged insufficient, he
may be examined upon interrogatories and committed until he
answers them.

56. When a plea is oftered in any action or suit, which is not sufficient in law to constitute a defense therein, the plaintiff may object to the filing thereof on that grouod, and the same 'ahall be rejected. But if the court overrule the objection and a1low the plea
to be filed, the plaintiff may take issue thereon without losing the
benefit of the objection, and may, on an appeal from a judgment
rendered in the case in favor of the defendant, avail himself of the
error committed in allowing such plea to be filed, without excepting
to the decision of the court thereon.

57. When a defendant in equity in his answer alleges new matter constituting a claim to affirmative relief, the case shall be decided upon the same principles, and the same relief shall be decreed
in the case, as if a cross bill had been filed to obtain such relief.

58. Whenever in any case a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the
court may cause them to be made parties to the action or suit by
amendment.

59. When a defendant in equity shall, in his answer, deny any
material allegation of the bill, the eff'ect of such denial shall only be
to put the plaintiff on satisfactory proof of the truth of such allegation, and any evidence which satisfies the court or jury of the truth
thereof shall be sufficient to establish the same.

60. The court shall have control over all proceedings in the office
during the preceding vacation. It may reinstate any cause discontinued during such vacation, set aside any oftheproceedingsorcorrect any mistake therein, and make such order concerning the same
as may be just.

61. A d-c'uration or count on a policy of insurance, whether the
-policy be under seal or not, may be in effect as follows:
Â· "'A-B-complains of C-D--,
who has been summoned to answer this: For that the defendant, by virtue of the
policy of insurance herewith filed, (or a copy of which is herewith
filed.) owes, (here state the amount claimed under the policy,) to the
plaintiff for loss in respect to the property (or subject) insured by
said policy, caused by (here insert the cause of loss in general terms,
for example: by fire, by the damages of navigation, or otherwise,
according to the faet.) on or about the -day of--,
in the year
--,
at (or near to
, stating the place at or near to which
.the loss occurred.")
If the declaration or. count be on a life policy, then it shall be
sufficient to follow the above form in effect down to and including
the word " plaintiff," and add thereto in effect as follows :
"Because of the death of E. F., whose life was insured by said
policy, and who died on or about the -day of --,
in the ~Â·ear
--,
at (or near to, stating the place where his death occurred,)
.--,"
or, if the fact be so, the plaintiff may state in the declaration
.or count that the time or place where the loss or death occurred is
unknown to him, giving in general terms such information as may
he in his power in respect thereto. Nothing contained in this section shall render insufficient in law any declaration, or count which
would be sufficient if this section had not been passed.

62. If good cause therefor be shown or appear, the court or judge
in vacation, may order the plaintiff to file a more particular statement, in any respect, of the nature of his claim, or the facts expected to be proved at. the trial, and may, stay the action until a reasonable time after such order is complied with; and such statement
must be made under the oath of the plaintiff, bis officer, agent, or
attorney-at-law, to the effect that the affiant believes the same will
be supported by evidence at the trial. But no such order shall be
made if it appear that there has been unreasonable delay on the part
of the defendant in applying therefor.

63. In like manner, if good cause therefor appear, and there be
no unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiff in applying for
such order, the court or judge, in vacation, may order the defendÂ·
ant to file a more particular statement, in any respect of the nature
of his defense, or the tacts expected to be proved at the trial, which
statement shall be m: .le under the oath of the defendant, his officer,
age:it or attorney-at-law, to the effect that the affiaot believes the
same will be supported by evidence at the trial.

64. To any declaration or count on a policy of insurance, whether
the same be in the form prescribed by the sixty-first section of this
chapter or not, and whether the act ion be covenant, debt or assumpÂ·
Bit, the defendant may plead that he is not liable to the plaintiff as
in i-l declaratiou is alleged. But if in any action on a po1icy of
in=urur.ce, the defense be that the action cannot be maintained because oi the failure tu perform or eomply with, or violation of any
clause, condition or warranty in, upon or annexed to the policy, or
contained in or upon any paper which is made by reterence a part of
the policy,,the defendant must file a statement in writing specifying
by reference thereto, or otherwise, the particular clause, condition
or warranty iu respect to- which such failure or violation is claimed
to have occurred, and such Â·statement must be verified by the oath
of the defendant, his officer, agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect
that the affiant believes the matter ot defense therein stated will be
supported by evidence at the trial.

65. Upon the plea mentioned in the next preceding section, the
plaintiff may join issue without other pleading. But if the plaintiff
intends to rely upon any matter in waiver, estoppel or in confession
and evidence of any matter which may have been stated by the defendant as aforesaid, the plaintiff must file 11. statement in writing,
specifying in general terms the matter on which he intends so to rely;
and such statement must be verified by the oath of the plaintiff, his
agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect the affiant believes the matter of reply therein stated will be supported by evidence at the trial.

66. If either party to such action fail to file any statement required of him by the four preceding sections of this chapter or by the
other party pursuant to any of the provisions of the said sections, or
if the statement be adjudged insufficient in whole or in part, the
court, as justice may require, may grant further time for filing the
same, or permit the statement filed to be amended, or may, at the
trial, exclude the evidence offered by the party in default as to any
matter which he has so failed to state or has insufficiently stated. But
no statement which, in the particulars required by or under the said
sections to be stated or referred to therein, is sufficient to notify the
adverse party in effect of the nature of the claim or defense intended
to be set up against him, shall be adjudged insufficient.

2. All acts and parts of acts coming within the purview of this
act, and inconsistent therewith, are hereby repealed.

1. In any action of debt, the defendant may plead payment of the
debt, (or of so much as is due by the condition,) before action
brought.

2. Io any personal action; the defendant may pay into court, to
the clerk, a sum of money on account of what is claimed, or by way
of compensation or amends, and plead that be is not indebted to the
plaintiff (or that the plaintiff has not sustained damages,) to a
greater amount than the said sum.

3. The plaintiff may accept the said sum either in full satisfaction and then have judgment for his costs, or in part satisfaction, and
reply to the plea generally, and if issue thereon be found for the
defendant, judgment shall be given for the defendant, and he shall
recover his costs.

4. In a suit for any debt, the defendant may at the trial prove,
and have allowed against such debt, any payment or set-cff which is
so described in his plea, or in an account filed therewith, as to give
the plaintiff notice ot its nature, but not otherwise.
Although the
claim of the plaintiff be jointly against several persons, and the setoff is of a debt, not to all, hut only to a part. of them, this section
shall extend to such set-off, if it appear that the persons against
whom such claim is, stand in the relation of principal and surety and
the person entitled to the set-off is the principal. And when the
defendant is allowed to file and prove an account of set-off' to the
plaintiff's demand, the plaintiff shall be allowed to file and prove
an account of counter set-off, and make such other defense as he
might have made had an original action been brought upon such setotf, and in the issue, the jury, judge, or justice shall ascertain the
true state of indebtedness between the parties, and judgment be
rendered accordingly.

5. In any action on a contract, the defendant may fHe a plea
alleging any such failure in the consideration of the contract, or
fraud in its procurement, or any such breach of any warranty to
Â· him of the title to real property or of the title or the soundness of
personal property, for the price or value whereof he entered into the
contract, as would entitle him, either to recover damages at law
from the plaintiff, or the person under whom the plaintiff claims, or
to relief in equity, in whole or in part, against the obligation of the
contract; or if the contract be by deed, alleging any such matter
existing before its execution, or any such mistake therein, or in the
execution thereof, as would entitle him to such relief in equity; and
in either case alleging the amount to which he is entitled by reason
of the matters contained in the plea. Every such plea shall be verified by affidavit.

6. If a defendant entitled to such plea as is mentioned in the preceding section shall not tender it, or though he tender it, if it be
rejected for not being offered in due time, he shall not be precluded
from such relief in equity as he would have been entitled to if the preceding section had not heen enacted. If an issue in fact is joined on
such plea and the same be found against the defendant, be shall be
barred of relief in equity upon the matters alleged in the plea, unless
upon such ground as would entitle a party to relief against a judgment in other eases, Every such issue 'in fact shall he upon a general replication that the plea is not true; and the plaintiff may give
in evidence, on such issue, any matter which could be given in evidence under a special replication, if such replication were allowed.

7. Nothing in this chapter shall impair or affect the obligation o{
any bond or other deed deemed voluntary in law upon any party
thereto or his representatives.

8. If the defendant file a plea or account of set-off' which covers
or applies to part of the plaintiff's demand, judgment may be forthwith rendered for the part not controverted, and the costs accrued
until the filing of the plea or account and the case shall be proceeded with for the residue as if the part for which judgment was
rendered had not been included therein. And if, in addition to
such plea or account, the defendant plead some other plea, going
to the whole or residue of the demand, the case shall not be continued as to the part not controverted by plea or account of setoff's, unless the additional plea be also verified by affidavit, or good
cause be shown for such continuance.

9. A defendant who files a plea or account under this chapter
shall be deemed to have brought an action against the plaintiff (at
the time of filing the same), for the matters mentioned in such plea
or account, and the plaintiff' shall not, after the plea or account ts
filed, dismiss his case without the defendant's consent, but shall be
entitled to every ground of defense against the defendant's demand, of
which he might have availed himself by special plea or otherwise in
any action brought against him upon the same demand. On the
trial of the issue in such case, the jury shall ascertain the amonnt to
which the defendant is entitled, and apply it as a set-oft against the
plaintiff's 'demand, and if the said amount be more than the plaintiff
is entitled to, shall ascertain the amount of the excess, including
principal and interest. Judgment in such case shall be for the
defendant against the plaintiff for said excess, with interest from the
date of the judgment till payment.

1. That in any action or suit or other proceeding for the enforcemeut of any contract, express or implied, where such contract was
for the sale or purchase of any real or personal property, made or
entered into between the first day of May, 186Â·1, and the first day of
May, 1865, it shall be lawful for either party to show by parol
or relevant testimony, what was the true understanding and agreement of the parties thereto, either express or to be implied, in respect to the kind of currency in which the same was to be fulfilled
or performed, or with reference to which, as a standard of value, it.
was made or entered into; and in an action at law or suit in equity
it shall be necessary to plead the agreement specially, in order to
admit such evidence.

2. Whenever it shall appear that any such contract was according
to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, to be fulfilled
or performed in Confederate States treasury notes, or Virginia treasury notes, or was entered into with reference to such notes as a
standard of value, the same shall be liquidated and settled by reducing the nominal amount due or payable 'under such contract in
Confederate States treasury notes or Virginia treasury notes, to its
true value at the time they were respectively made and entered iuto,
or at such other time as may to the court, or, if it be a jury case, to
the jury seem right in the particular case, and upon the payment of
the value as ascertained, the party bound by such contract shall be
forever discharged, of and from the same, provided that in all cases
where actual payment has been made of any sum of such Coufederate States treasury notes, or Virginia treasury notes, either in ful 1
or in part, of the amount payable under contract, the party by or
for whom the same was paid, shall have full credit for the nominal
amount as paid, and such payment shall not be reduced. Andi f any
debt payable in coin, or its equivalent, by a principal debtor has
been paid by the security for such debt, under and by virtue of a
judgment against such security, or other demand for payment npon
such security, so that such payment shall operate as a discharge of
the principal debtor from his original obligation under the provisions of this act, in any controversy between such security so paying
and the principal debtor, the mode of payment by such security shall
not be inquired into.]

1. Where a party dies, or becomes convict of felony, or insane, or
the powers of a party who is a personal representative or committee cease, if such fact occur after verdict, judgment may be entered Â·
as if it had not occurred.

2. Where such fact occurs in any stage of a cause, whether it be
in a court of original or appellate jurisdiction, it it occur as to any
of several plaintiffs or defendants, the suit may proceed for or
ag-ainst the others, it the cause or snit survive to or against them.
If a plaintiff or defendant die pending any action, whether the cause
of action would survive at common law or not, the same may be revived and prosecuted' to judgment and execution in the same manner
as if it were for a cause of action arising out of contract.
3. If, in any case of appeal, writ of error, or supcrsedeas, which
is now or may hereafter be pending, there be at any time in an appellate court, suggested or relied on in abatement, the death of a
party, or any other fact which, if it had occurred after verdict in an
action, would not have prevented judgment being entered (as if it
had not occurred), the appellate court may, in its discretion, enter
judgment or decree in such case as if the said fact had not occurred.
4. In any stage of any case a seire facias may be sued out for or
against the committee of any party who is insane or a convict; or
for or against a party before insane, the powers of whose committee
have ceased ; or for or against the personal representative of the decedent who, or whose personal representative, was a party; or for
or against the heirs or devisees of a decedent who was a party; or

such new party (except in an appellate court) may have a continuance of the case at the term at which such order is entered ; and the
court may allow him to plead anew or amend the pleadings as far
as it deems reasonable ; but in other respects the case shall proceed
to final judgment or decree for or against him, in like manner as if
the case had been pending for or against him before such ecire facias
or motion.
5. The clerk of the court in which the case is may issue such scire
[acias at any time, and an order may be entered at rules for the case
to proceed in the name of the proper party, although the case be on
the court docket.
6. Where the party whose powers cease is defendant, the plaintiff'
may continue his suit against him to final judgment or decree; but
he shall not, at law, proceed in the same action against such defendant and his successor, nor shall he, in equity, proceed against both
upon his previous hill, unless an order that the suit proceed against
the former party, be entered at the first term after service of a seire
facias for or against such successor.
7. If the committee, personal representative, heirs, or devisees of
the plaintiff or appellant who was a party, or of the decedent whose
personal representative was plaintiff or appellant, shall not make
such motion 01 apply for such seire [acias at or before the second
term of the court next after that at which there may have been a
suggestion on the record of the fact making such scire [aeias or motion proper, the suit of such plaintiff or appellant shall he discontinued, unless good cause be shown to the contrary.
8 . .Any court, in which is pending any case wherein for more than
four years there has been no order or proceeding but to continue it,
may, in its discretion, order such case to be struck from its docket;
and it shall thereby be discontinued. A court making such order
may direct it to be published in such newspaper as it may name.
9. When in any suit in equity, the number of parties exceeds
thirty, and any one of said parties, jointly interested with others in
any question arising therein, shall die, the court may nevertheless
proceed, if in its opinion all classes of interest in the case are represented, and the interest. of no one will be prejudiced by the trial of
the cause, to render a decree in such suit as if such person were
alive, decreeing to the heirs at law, distributees, or representatives of
such person, as the case may require, such interest as such person

dred and twenty-four shall apply to decrees entered under the preceding section.
11. (Acts 1882, p. 95.) Any circuit court may, on motion, reinstate on the trial docket of the court any case dismissed and set aside
any non-suit that may be entered by reason of the non-appearance
of the plaintiff, within three terms after the order of dismissal may

OF OOSTH GENERALLY.
PRIVILEGE EXTENDED TO POOR PERSONS.

L A poor person may be allowed by a court to sue or defend a suit
therein without paying fees or costs, whereupon he shall have, from
any counsel which the court may assign him, and from all officers,
all needful services and proeess, and also the attendance of witnesses,
without any fees to them therefor, except what may be included in
the costs recoverable from the opposite party.
SECl:RITY FOR COSTS.

2. In any suit (except where such poor person is plaintiff) there
may be a suggestion on the record in court, or if the case be at rules,
on the rule docket, by a defendant 01Â· any officer of the court, that
the plaintiff is not a resident of this state, and that security is required of him. After sixty days from such suggestion, the suit
shall by order of the court. be dismissed, unless before the dismission
the plaintiff be proved to be a resident of the state, or security be
given before said court, or the clerk thereof for payment of the
costs which may be awarded to the defendant, and of the fees due,
or to become due, in such suit, to the officers of the court. The security shall he hy bond payable to the state; but there need only be
one obligor therein, if he be sufficient. The court before whose clerk
such bond is given, may on motion by a defendant or officer, give
judgment for so much as he is entitled to by virtue of said bond.
3. On motion of an obligor in such bond, after reasonable notice
to the plaintiff, his attorney-at-law or agent, the court may order a
new bon<l to he given, with sufficient security, in a penalty equal to
the penalty of the former hond. If the hond required under this
section he not giYen within such time as the court may prescribe, it
may order the suit to be dismissed. If such new bond be given, the
surety in the former one shall he relieved from ~my liability he
might have incurred because of having executed or acknowledged
the same. After the notice has been given to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, no further proceedings shall be had in said cause,
until such new bond is given with sufficient security, or a sufficient
excuse is given for not exec~ting the same.
CASE,'- WHEREI:S COSTS ARE RECOVERED.

4. Upon any motion, (other than for a judgment for money) or
upon any interlocutory order or proceeding, the court may give or
refuse costs, at its discretion, unless it be otherwise provided. It
may, when a demurrer is sustained to a plea in abatement, give
judgment for the plaintiff for his full costs to the time of sustaining
it, and when any part of the proceedings is adjudged insufficient,
order all costs occasioned by such insufficient pleading to be paid byhim who committed the fault.

CHAPTER CXXXVIII.

5. New trials may be granted upon the payment of costs, or with
the costs to abide the event of the suit, as to the court may seem
right.
If the party who is to pay the costs of the former trial fail
to pay the same at or before the next term after the new trial is
granted the court may, on the motion of the opposite party, set
aside the order granting it, and proceed to judgment on the verdict
or award execution for said costs, as may seem to it best.
Where a
case is continued at the costs of a party against the consent of the
opposite party, the court may, in its discretion award an execution
for the costs of such continuance.
6. In any personal action
not on contract, which might he
brought and prosecuted to judgment in a justice's court, if a verdict be found for the plaintiff on au issue or otherwise, for less dam ..
ages than fifty dollars, he shall not recover, in respect to such verdict, auy costs, unless the court enter of record that the object of the
action was to try a right besides the mere right to recover damages
for the trespass or grievance in respect of which the action was
brought, or that the said trespass or grievance was willful or malicious.
7. In any personal action on contract, wherein it is ascertained
that not more is due the plaintiff than fifty dollars, exclusive of interest, judgment shall be given for the defendant, unless the court
enter of record that the matter in controversy was of greater value
than fifty dollars, exclusive of interest ; in which case it may give
judgment for the plaintiff for what is ascertained to be due him,
with or without costs, as to it may seem right.
8. Except where it is otherwise provided, the party for whom final
judgment is given in any action, or in a motion for judgment for
money, whether he be plaintiff or defendant, shall recover his costs
against the opposite party ; and' when the action is against two or
more, and there is a judgment for or discontinuance as to some but
not all of the defendants, unless the court enter of record that there
was reasonable cause for making defendants those for whom there
is judgment, or as to whom there is such discontinuance (and order
otherwise) they shall recover their costs.
9. When a suit is in the name of one person for the benefit of any
other, if there be a judgment for the defendant's cost, it shall be
against such other.
10. The laws of costs shall not be interpreted as penal laws; nor
shall anything in this chapter take away or abridge the discretion of
a court of equity over the subject of costs, except as follows:
11. In every case in an appellate court, costs shall be recovered
in such court by the party substantially prevailing.
HOW

ANT> WHAT COST:oi ARE TO BE TAXED.

12. The clerk of a court wherein a party recovers costs shall tax

said party appears to be chargeable with, in the case wherein the rec<,very is, except that where, in :my court on the same side, mere
than one copy of anything is obtained or taken out, in which- may
be included a copy of any pleading in a pending case, Â·there shall be
taxed only the fee for one copy of the same thing. He shall also
tax fifty cents for each legal notice from such party therein, served
in this state, r.nd not otherwise taxed.
15. The price for publishing all advertisements and publications
required to be made by law, or by the order of a court, in any cause
or proceeding therein, or by any provision of a deed of trust, or
where any publication is made pursuant to law and no price is
named, shall not exceed one cent and a quarter for each word for the
first insertion, an<l the half of one cent for each word for every subsequent insertion required to be made; and if no newspaper in
which such publication may be made will insert the same for the
time required, or the price aforesaid, then the notice shall be posted

~WITS TO E~FORCE JCD(DIE!,.T LIENS.

1. The lien of a judgment may always be enforced in a court of
equity.
If Â·it appears to such a court that the rents and profits of
the real estate subject to the lien will not satisfy the judgment in
five years, the court may decree the said estate, or any part thereof,
to be sold nnd the proceeds applied to the discharge of the judgment. In every such suit all persons having liens on the real estate
sought to be subjected by judgment or otherwise, shall be made parties
plaintiff or defendant, or if the number of such persons exceed ten
the suit may be brought by any one or more of them, for the benefit
of himself, and such other lien holders as will come in and contribute to the expenses of the suit. And whether the suit be so brought
or not, every such lieu holder, whether he be named as a party to
the suit or not, or whether he be served with process therein or not,
may present, prove and have allowed any claim he may have against
the judgment debtor, which is a lien on such real estate, or any part
thereof, and from and after tho time he presents any such claim he
shall be deemed a party plaintiff in such suit. No decree for the
distribution of the proceeds of such real. estate shall be made until
a notice to all persons holding liens on the real estate of the judgment debtor be posted and published, under a decree of the court,
as hereinafter provided.
Such notice shall be sufficient if it be in
form or effect as follows :
":N"OTICETO LIEN HOLDERS.

To all persons holding liens by judgment or otherwise, on the
real estate, or any part thereof, of A-B--:
In pursuance of a decree of the circuit court of
county,
made in a cause therein pending, to subject the real estate of the
said A-R-to the satisfaction of the liens thereon, you are
hereby required to present all claims held by you and each of you
against the said A--Â· B--,
which are liens on his real estate, or

oounty,and posted at the front door of the court-house of such
county at least four weeks before the day mentioned in the notice;
and such publishing and posting of such notice shall be equivalent
to the personal service thereof on all per .sons holding liens on any
such real estate, unless the court shall in the decree directing such
notice to be so published and posted otherwise order. The commissioner to whom the case is referred bv such decree shall as soon
as possible after tl-we said notice is published and posted as aforesaid,
or served in such manner as the court may order, proceed to ascertain und report all the lieus on the real estate or any part thereof of
the judgment debtor, the holders of such liens, the amount due to
each, and the priorities thereof, and such other matters and things
as the court by its decree may direct, and the same proceedings shall
be had on such report as in other suits in chancery.
When the re' port of any such commissioner is confirmed, if the claims therein
reported (if any) he not paid, the court shall decree that the real estate of the judgment debtor, subject to such lien or liens, so far as
as may be necessary, shall he rented or sold, and the proceeds thereof
distributed among the several lien holders who have appeared and
proved their liens and claims, according to their several priorities
(if any); which decree shall be a bar to the claim of any lien
holder who has not appeared and presented his claim to said commissioner, as required by said notice; except that if a surplus remain after the payment of the claims so presented and proved, and
confirmed by the court, the lien holder so failing to appear may shure
in such surplus, upon proving his claim at any time before a final
decree in the case, in such manner as the court shall direct. But if
he fail to present his claim before such final decree, he shall be forever barred of all right to participate in the proceeds of such real
estate, so far as the other creditors of said judgment debtor, holding
liens on his _real estate, who have not so failed, are concerned, and
so far as the creditors at large of such judgment debtor are concerned. If, pending any such suit, a judgment at law be recovered by
any person against such judgment debtor, such person may present
his claim to the commissioner and have it adjudicated and allowed
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the judgment had
been obtained before the institution of such suit. And he may present such claim to the court after the report is made, and before the
entering of a decree distributing the proceeds of the sale of such real
estate, and have the same adjudicated and passed upon by the court
and if found to be correct, and a lien upon such real estate, the
court shall allow and confirm the same, and provide for the payment thereof in the decree of the sale and distribution.
If after the
commencement of such suit any lien holder commence any other
suit or proceeding in or out of court to enforce a lien claimed by
him on the real estate, or any part thereof, of the judgment debtor,
upon which a lien is sought to be enforced by such suit, the court,
or the judge thereof in vacation may enjoin him from so doing, and

officer who may be designated for the purpose by an order of the
court in which the judgment is, or if the judgment be of a justice,
