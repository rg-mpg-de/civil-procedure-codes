to the plaintiff' to strike out the name of the person residing in the county, and 
proceed ~r.rainst the one residing out of the county alone. Ib.

SEC. 51. The summons shall be served by the officer to whom it is di­
rected, who shall indorse on the original writ, the time and manner
of service. It may, also, be served b1 any person not a party to
the 11,etion, appointed by the officer to whom it is directed. Thf
authority of such person shall be indorsed on the writ. When tlu
writ is served by a person appointed by the officer to whom it is di
reeted, or when the service is made out of this state, the return shall
be :iverified by oath or affirmation.1 
SEC. 62. lliNNBR OF SERVICB. 
' .The service shall be by delivering a copy of the summons to the
defendant personally, or by leaving one at his usual place of resi­
dence, at any time before the return day.

The officer to whom the summons is directed, must return the
same at the time therein stated. 
8EC. 65. WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO SBRVICB. 
An acknowledgment on the back of the summons, or the volun­
tary appearance of a defendant, is equivalent to service.1 
a. It is not proper practice for the attorney of the plaintiff' to acknowledge
aervioe of procesa for the defendant, and thereby bring him into court. And 
the court in such case will refuse to enter up a judgment. Sleeper e, Sleeper, 
1 Handy, 530. 
• 1), A party defendant pleading to the action, thereby, by implication of law,
·• enters his appearance in the action, and is estopped from denying the service 
of prooess. Evans ti. Iles, 7 0. St. 233. 
c. A defendant by filing a demurrer to the petition, is estopped from deny·
ing the service of process, unless the authority by which this is done can be 
impeached. Ih. 
d. Where a. motion is pending to strike the cause from the docket for want
or service, and a demurrer to· the petition is filed, it is error to order the cue
stricken from the docket, although the demurrer may have been previously 
withdrawn by leave of the oourl 16. 
Sso. 66. How SERVED ON i.. CORPORATION. 
A summons against a corporation, may be served upon the presi­
dent, mayor, chairman of the board of directors or trusteea, or other
chief officer; or, if its chief officer is not foundin the county, upon 
its cashier, treasurer, secretary, clerk, or managing agent; or, if
none of the aforesaid officers can be found, by a copy left at the
office, or usual place of business of such corporation, with the per­
son having charge thereof.2 
Ssc, 67. How SERVED ON AN INStJRANOE OOKPANY. 
H Where the defendant is an incorporated insurance company, and
the action is brought in a. county in which there is an agency
thereof, the service m~y be upon the chief officer of such agency. 
SF.O. 68. How SERVED ON A FOREIGN OORPORA.TlON. 
Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, having a manag­
ing agent in this state, the service may be upon such agent.1 
a Unless a. foreign corporation has within the state a managing agent, for the'
ordinary transaction of its business, it can not be held liable in our courts by •
any proceeding in personam. Barney 11. New Albany and Salem R. R Co.

Handy, 571. 
Sm. 69. How SERVED UPON INFANTS. 
When the defendant is a minor under the age of fourteen years,
tlie service must be upon him and upon his guardian, or father; or,
if neither of these can be found, then upon his mother, or the per­
son having the care or control of the infant, or with whom he lives.
If neither of these can be found, or, if the minor be more than four­
teen years of age, service on him alone, shall be sufficient. The
manner of service may be the same as in the case of adults. 
1 
SEC. 70. WHEN SERVICE HA.Y BE MADB BY PUBLICATION OF NOTICR. 
Service may be made by publication in either of the following
eases: 
In actions brought under the forty-fifth and forty-sixth sections
of this Code, where any or all the defendants reside out of the 
state: 
In actions brought ·to establish or set aside a. will, where any or
all the defendants reside out of the state : 
In actions brought against a nonresident of this state, or a for­
eign corporation, having in this state property or debts owing to
them, sought to be taken by any of the provisional remedies, or to 
be appropriated in any way : 
In actions which relate to, or the subject of which is, real or per­
sonal property in this state, where any defendant has or claims a
lien or interest, actual or contingent, therein, or the relief demanded
consists wholly or partly in excluding him from any interest therein,
and such defendant is a non-resident of the state or a foreign cor­
poration: 
And in all actions, where the defendant being a resident of the
state, has departed therefrom, or from the county of his residence,
with intent to delay or defraud his creditors, or to avoid the service
of a summons, or keeps himself concealed therein with the like 
intent. " 
a. It is clearly apparent, from all the provisions of the Code on the subject of
the service of a summons, contained in title 5, chapter 2, that service by publi­
cation, in the cases and mode prescribed, must be deemed a complete and suf­
ficient service of process, and on proof thereof aa required, authorizes a judg­
ment. Vallett.e t,. Ken Trust Co. Bank, 2 Handy, 1. 
b. A foreign dissolved corporation may be served with process by publication;
the same a.s if not diesolred, Ib. 
SEC. 71. AFFIDA. VIT TO BE MADE. 
Before service can be made by publication, an affidavit must be
filed, that service of a summons can not be made within this state,
on the defendant or defendants to be served by publication, and
that the case is one of those mentioned in the preceding section.
When such affidavit is filed, the party may proceed to make service 
by publication.1 
SEC. 72. PUBLICATION HOW MADB1 AND WR.AT THB NOTICB MUST CONTAIN. 
The publication must be made six consecutive w.eeks, in some
newspaper printed in the county where the petition is filed, if there
be any printed in such county; and if there be not, in some news­
paper printed in this state, of general circulation in that county.
It must contain a. summary statement of the object and ptayer of 
the petition, mention the court wherein it is filed, and notify the
person or persons thus to be served, when they are required to
answer.1 
a. A notice to non-resident defendants by publication must contain a perti­
nent description of the property sought to be a.ft'ected, whereby the party would
be more apt to receive actual notice. Lawler e, Whetts, 1 Handy, 39. 
b. A notice that the action is brought" for the recovery of money, and for
the foreclosure of a mortgage," is not a sufficient statement of the object and 
prayer or the petition. Ib. 
e. A strict and literal compliance with the law of notice by publication
should be required. Ib. 
d. The notice to a non-resident defendant in attachment, should give a per­ 
tinent description of the real estate, which is sought to be subjected to the
payment of the debt. Clark v. Southgate, 2 Law Ga.z. 44. 
e, Where the notice stated " that attachment had issued and levied on real
estate," held, that it was np description and was insufficient. lb. 
f To entitle a plaintiff to judgment, upon service of summons by publica­
tion only, the notice should set forth the issuing of an attachment, and should 
contain a description of the property attached. Moses "· McKim, 2 W. Law
Monthly, 15. 
~BO. 73. WHEY SERVICE BY PUBLICATION OOllPLETB-PROOF. 
Service by publication shall be deemed complete, when it shall 
have been made in the manner and for the time prescribed in the
preceding section ; and such service shall be proved by the affida­
vit of the printer, or his foreman, or principal clerk, or other per­
son knowing the same.' 
a. Though there is no provision of the Code requiring the court to approve
of the publication of notice, and order the proof to be filed, independent of
the final action of the court, in rendering a judgment predicated on the publi­
cation, it is, perhaps, a. convenient practice, in view of the probable loss of the
papers and affidavits. Vallette e, Ken. Trust Co. Bank, 2 Handy, 1. 
b. Is it the duty of the court, on the submission of the action for judgment, 
to look behind the affidavit of the plaintiff, filed under section 71 of the Code,
and determine whether ihe affidavit bas been truly and properly made; wheth·
er, in point of fact, the C88e is one 88 claimed by the plaintiff, authorising a
service by publication. Quere? Ib. 
a. The service will be completed on the day of the last or sixth publication,
and the time to answer will be the third Saturdu.y after that day. Nash's
Plead. and Prac. ~. 
d. Forty·two entire days must elapse after and ezcltuioe ·or the day of the
first publication; and that seven entire days must elapse after, and exclusive
of the date of the last of the six publications, before any one of the three Sat­
urdays which fix the time for answer, can be counted for that purpose. Gil­
fillin e, Koke, 1 W. Law Monthly, 704. 
SEC. 7 4. SERVICE os BUJOIONS OUT OF THE STATE. 
, In all cases where service may be made by publication, personal
service of a copy of the summons and complaint may be made out 
of the state. 
2 
8J!IO. 75. JUDGMENT B.BNDBRBD UPON SERVICE MADE BY PUBLICATION MAY BE
OPENED. 
A party against whom a judgment or order has been rendered
without other service than by publication in a newspaper, may, at
any time within fiv~ years after the date of the judgment or order,
have the same opened, and be let in to defend. Before the judg­
ment or order shall be opened, the applicant shall give notice to
the adverse party of his intentions to make such an application,
and shall file a full answer to the petition, pay all costs, if the 
court require them to be paid, and make it appear to the satisfac­
tion of the court, by affidavit, that during the pendency of the
action he had no actual notice thereof in time to appear in court
and make his defense ; but the title to any property, the subject of
the judgment or order sought to .be opened, which, by it or in con­
sequence of it, shall have passed to a. purchaser in good faith,
shall not be affected by any proceedings under this section, nor
shall they affect the title of any property sold before judgment
under an attachment. The adverse party, on the hearing of an
application to open judgment, or order, as provided by this sec­
tion, shall be allowed to.present counter affidavits to show that du­
ring the pendency of the action, the applicant had notice thereof,
in time to appear in court and make his defense. 
SEC. 76. ACTION AGAINST UNKNOWN HEIRS. 
In actions where it shall be necessary to make the heirs or de- ·
visees of any deceased person, defendants, and ii shall appear by
the affids;yit o( the plaintiff annexed to his petition, that the names
of such heirs or devisees, or any of them, and their residence, are
unknown to the plaintiff, proceedings may be had against such un­
known heirs or devisees, without naming them, and the court shall
make such order respecting service, as may be deemed proper ; if
service by publication be ordered, the publication shall not be less
than six weeks.· 
SEC. 77. P:ROOBBDINGS WBD TBERB ARB SBVBRAL DEFEND.A..~TS A..""iD PART ONLY
..lU SERVED. 
Where the action is against two or more defendants, and one or
more shall have been served, but not all of them, the plaintiff may 
proceed as follows : · 
1. If the action be against defendants jointly indebted upon
contract, he may proceed against the defendants served, unless the
court otherwise direct: 
2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may,
without prejudice to his rights against those not served, proceed
against the defendants served in the same manner as if they were
the only defendants.1 · 
a. Judgment mo.y be taken aga.inst one of several defendants served, and the
plaintiff' ma.y proceed in the same action against those defendants not served,
by another summons. Lennig & Co. e, Burgoyne & Knowlton, 1 Handy, 77. 
6. This right is subject to the control and direction of the court, under sec­
tion 371, and will be exercised, when it would inconvenience tho admlnistra­ 
tion of justice or prejudice the other party. JlJ.
c. The court will not refuse to allow the plaintiff to proceed, where it will 
expedite and assist him in obtaining justice; save him from unnecessary costs;
and in no respect infringe on the just right.s of others. Ib. 
d. See seceiona 58, 371 and 415, notes, 
SEC. 78. PL'-DENCY OP TBB ACTION PROTECTS THE PLAISTIFF's TITLE. 
When the summons has been served, or publication made, the
action is pending, so as to charge third persons with notice of its
pendency, and while pending, no interest can be acquired by third
persons in the subject matter thereof, as against the plaintiff's 
title. 
SEC. 79. JuooxENT TO BE NOTICE ONLY IY THE COUNTY WHERE BEYI>EB.ED, UNLESS
RECORDED ELSEWHERE. 
When any part of real property, the subject matter of an action,
is situated in any other county or counties than the one in which
the action is brought, a certified copy of the judgment in such ac­ 
tion must be recorded in the recorder's office of such other county
or counties, before it shall operate therein as notice, so as to charge
third persons, as provided in the preceding section. It shall op­
erate as such notice, without record, in the county where it is ren­
dered; but this section shall not apply to actions or proceedings 
under any statute now in force, which does not require such re­ 
cord. 
SEC. 80. WHAT CA1JSE8 OF ACTION lllA.Y BE JOINED. 
The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the same pe­
tition, whether they be such as have heretofore been denomi­
nated legal or equitable, or both, when they are included in either
one of the following classes : 
1. The same transactions ; or transactions connected with the
same subject of action : 
2. Contracts, express or implied:
8. Injuries, with or without forct!; to person and property, or 
either:
4. Injuries to character:
5. Claims to recover the possession of personal property, with 
or without damages for the withholding thereof:
6. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for 
the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same :
7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract or by opera­ 
tion of law. 
SEC. 81. CAUSES JOINED MUST AFFECT ALL THE PARTIES. 
The ca.uses of action so united, must affect all the parties to the
action, and not requir.e different places of trial.1

lowed by the word "Petition."1 
2. A statement of facts constituting the cause of action, in or­
dinary and concise language, and without repetition.1 
3. A demand of the relief to which the party supposes himself
entitled. If the recovery or money be demanded, the amount
thereof shall be stated ; and if interest thereon be claimed, the
time- from which interest is to be computed, shall be also stated.' 
Ssc, 86. How BACH OAUSE OF ACTION TO BE S't.A.TED AND NUMBERED. 
Where the petition contains more than one cause of action, each 
shall be separately stated and numbered.1 
8EC. 87. WHEN THB DEFENDANT :'.\fAY DB:IIUR. 
The defendant may demur to the petition only when it appears
on its face, either, 
1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the de­
fendant, or the subject of the action : 
2. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue :
3. That there is another action pending between the same parties 
for the same cause: 
4. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant:
5. 'I'hat.several causes of action are improperly joined: 
6. That the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a.
co.use of action.1 · 
SEC. 88. GROUNDS OF DEllURRER ll'C"ST BE STATED. 
The demurrer shall specify distinctly the grounds of objection
to the petition. Unless it do so, it shall be regarded as objecting
only, that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action. 
SEC. 89. WHEN OBJECTION :VAY DE TAKES BY A!'ff!WER1 WHE:S DEEMED WAIVED. 
When any of the defects enumerated in section eighty-seven, do
not appear upon the face of the petition, the objection may be
taken ~y answer; and if no objection be taken either by demurrer
or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived the same,
except only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, and that
the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.'

When a demurrer is sustained on the ground of misjoinder of
several causes of action, the court, on motion of the plaintiff, shall
allow him, with or without costs in its discretion, to file several 
petitions, each including such of said causes of action as might
have been joined ; and an action shall be docketed for each of said
petitions, and the same shall be proceeded in without further
service. 
a. Section 90 of the C-ode applies, as well where the objection to a misjoinder
of causes of action is made by answer, as by demurrer. Cloon ti. City Ins. Co.,

The answer shall contain :
1. A general or specific denial of each material allegation of the 
petition controverted by the defendant.
2. A statement of any new matter constituting a defense, coun­ 
ter-claim or set-off, in ordinary and concise language and without
repetitiori.1 
SEC. 92.-1. The new matter must be fact.s, and where the answer al­
leged that a note, sought to be recovered upon, was obtained by fraud, but did
not set out the fact.s and circumstances of such fraud, it was held insufficient 
on that ground. Mcl\Iurray & Thomas "· Gifford, 5 Howard, 14. 
2. In an action for a money demand on contract, the defendant may set up, 
SEC. 93. }L,y STATE DIFFERE~T DEFENSES~UNTER-OLAW-SET-OFF-LEOA.L OR
EQUITABLE DEFENSES. 
The defendant may set forth in his answer as many grounds of
defense, counter-claim and set-off, as he may have, whether they
be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or
both. · Each must be separately stated and numbered, as they must
refer in an intelligible manner to the causes of action which they
are intended to answer.1 
SEC. 94. CoUNTER-cLAnr. . 
The counter-claim, mentioned in the last section must be one ex­
isting in favor of a defendant, and against a. plaintiff', between
whom a. several judgment might be had in the action, and arising 
out of the contract or transaction set forth in the petition as the
foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject
of the action.' 
SEC. 95. CoSTS ON COUNTBR-OLAD( OR BE'N>Flll r.t SUBSBQUBN'T ACTION. 
If the defendant omit to set up the counter-claim or set-off, he
ca.n not recover costs against the plaintiff in any subsequent ac­
tion thereon ; but this section shall not apply to causes of action 
which are stricken out of or withdrawn from the answer, as pro­
vided in sections ninety-six and one hundred and nineteen.1 
SEC. 96. NBW PARTY TO BB lUDB IP NHCBSSARY.

A set-off can only be pleaded in an action founded on contract,
and must be a. cause of action arising upon contract or ascertained
by the decision of the court.1 
SEC. S3. NEW PARTY TO SET-OFF. 
When it appears that a new party is necessary to a final decis­
ion upon the set-off, the court shall permit the new party to be
made, if it also appear, that owing to the insolvency or non-resi­
dence of the plaintiff, or other cause, the defendant will be in dan­
ger of losing his claim, unless permitted to use it as a set-off. 
SEC. 99. WHEN CROSS DB11ANDS TO BB DEBllED COMPENSA..TJID. 
When cross-demands have existed between persons under such
circumstances, that if one had brought an action against the other,
a. counter-claim or set-off, could have been set up, neither can be
deprived of the benefit thereof by the assignment or death of the
other, but the two demands must be deemed compensated, so far
as they equal each other.

The plaintiff may demur to one or more of the defenses set up
in the answer, stating in his demurrer the grounds thereof; and
where the answer contains new matter, the plaintiff may reply to
such new matter, denying generally or specifically, each allegatiQD
controverted by him ; and he may allege in ordinary and concise
language, and without repetition, any new matter not inconsistent
with the petition, constituting an answer in law to such new mat­

SEC. 103. TIME FOR. PLEADING. 
The answer or demurrer by the defendant shall be filed on or be­
fore the third Saturday, and the reply or demurrer by the plaintiff, 
on or before the fifth Saturday, after the return day of the sum-.
mons or service by publication. 
a. See Rule XIX of the supreme court-ante page. 
b. The defendant has the usual time for answer after every material amend­
ment, whether that amendment is made under sections 134 and 135 of the 
Code, or in term time, on leave obtained from the court. Mather v. Gallia Fur­
nace Co. 1 Wes. Law Monthly, 351. 
c. When the petition is such that a judgment by default could be legally ren­
dered upon it, this ruling will not apply. lb.

Saturday next after the day of the last publication of the notice. Nash. Plead.

SEC. 104. Tnm FOR PLEADING KAY BE EXTENDED. 
The court, or the judge thereof in vacation, for good cause shown,
may extend the time for filing an answer or reply, upon such terms
as may be just. 
1 
a. Whether a party shall be permitted. to plead the statute of limitations af­
ter a default, is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court. New- 
som' s adm'r e, Ran, 18 0. R. 240. · 
b. A failure of the plaintiff' to give security for costs according to an order
of court, is no excuse for the defendant neglecting to file his plea. lb. 
c. A default for answer, may be set aside, where a meritorious defense is
shown, upon payment of the costs by the defendant. Messick & Co. and Ken.
Trust Co. Bank e, Roxbury & Wiloox, 1 Handy, 190. 
d. The time for answer ought not to be extended, without notice, where it
will operate as a continuance of the cause. The unexpected absence of a party
or counsel at the time when the answer must be filed, or where certain papers,
without which a party can not answer, can not yet be obtained, would be good
ground for extending the time. Nub. Plead. and Pra.o. 100. 
SEC. 105. PLEADINGS MUST BE SUBSCRIBED. L~TERROOATORIES MAY BE FILED1 A.."f· 
S'\YERS UNDER OATH ENFORCED. 
Every pleading in a court of record must be subscribed by the
party or his attorney. Any party may, in all cases in which he
would have the right to use the deposition of an adverse party,
whether plaintiff or defendant, also annex ·to his pleading, other 
tha.n a. demurrer, interrogatories pertinent to the ease, which inter­
rogatories, if not demurred to, shall be plainly and fully answered,
under oath. When annexed to the petition, they shall be answered
within 'the time limited for answer to the petition-when annexed . 
. to the answer, they shall be answered within the time limited for
reply-when annexed to the reply, they shall be answered within
the period allowed for answers to petitions in general; but further
time may be allowed in any case, by the court or judge, in vaca­
tion. Answers to interrogatories may be enforced by nonsuit,
judgment by default, or by attachment, as the justice of the case
may require; on the trial such answer may be used as evidence by
either party." (As amended March 6, 1857. 54 0. L. 23.) 
a. For original sec. 105, see 51 0. L. 74. 
SEC. 106. PLEADINGS TO BE VERIFIED. 
That every pleading of fact, must be verified by the affidavit of
the party, his agent or attorney. When a. corporation is a party,
the verification may be made by an officer thereof, its agent or at­
torney; and when the state, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is
a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted
with the facts, the attorney prosecuting or defending the action,
the prosecuting attorney, or attorney general. A pleading verified
as herein required, shall not be used against a party in any crimi­
nal prosecution, or action or proceeding for a penalty or forfeiture,
as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading, and such
verification shall not make other, or greater proof necessary on the
side of the adverse party.2 (As amended March 11, 1854. 52
0. L. 22.) 
SEC. 107. WHEN VERIFICATION NOT REQUIRED. 
The verification mentioned in the last section, shall not be re­

b. In an action on a. judgment rendered by a court of a sister state, it is ne­
ceBBary to set out in the petition itself the same substantial allegations, as were
required in a declaration in debt, under the common law system :or pleading.

answer, and every material allegation of new matter in the answer
not controverted by the reply, shall, for the purposes of the action,

No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof,
is to be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the ad­ 
verse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense
upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has been so
misled, that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court,
and it must also be shown in what respect he has been misled; and
thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon
such terms as may be j ust.1

When, however, the allegation of the claim or defense, to which
the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular, or par­
ticulars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be·
deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a fail­ 
ure of proof.1

The court may, before, or after judgment, in furtherance of jus­
tice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading,
process or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any
party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, [or] a.
mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations ma­
terial to the case, or, when the amendment does not ehenge sub­
stantially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading or pro­
ceeding to the facts proved. And whenever any proceeding taken
by a party fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this
Code, the court may permit the same to be made conformable
thereto, by a.mendment.1 
SEC. }38. IMMATERIAL ERROR.~ A."ro DEPEOTS1 HOW REGARDED.

SEC. 143. WHAT ACTIONS MAY BE CONSOLIDATED. 
Whenever two or more actions are pending in the same court,
which might have been joined, the defendant may, on motion and
notice to the adverse party, require him to show cause why the
same shall not be consolidated, and if no such cause be shown, the
said several actions shall be consolidated. 
a. Where two separate suits are brought, one upon anote, the other to fore­
close the mortgage that secured the same note, the actions may be consolidated
as in such case but one suit should be brought. Howlett v. Martin, 3 Law
Gaz. 266. 
b. The object of consolidating actions is to save costs, and prevent multi­
plicity of suits; it is always regarded with favor, and never denied, when it is
clear that the parties are the same, and the cause :or action is identical How­ 
lett e, Martin, 3 Law Ga.z. 266.
c. Unless the joinder will produce manifest incongruity, and the parties be 
deprived of the benefit of a. full and fair trial, there would seem to be no good
ground to forbid the pursuit of all the usual remedies, at the same time and in
the same procedure. lb. 
d. In an action to obtain judgment on a promissory note secured by mort­
gage, and to foreclose the mortgage, judgment should be rendered on the note, 
and an order made for the sale of the mortgaged premises. lb.

a. In an action against special bail, judgment was entered against the princl­
pal, at the April term, and exeoutioa issued thereon, and returned "not found"
and suit commenced against the bail, in which summons was issued returnable
on the 10th, and served on the 3d of September, and duly returned; and Sep­
tember 29th default of the bail for answer to the petition was entered upon the
docket by order of the court, and cause continued to the October term; during
which, on the 8th of October, the bail, without showing cause arising previous
to their becoming finally charged, obtained leave of court, and surrendered
their principal. Held: 
Ist, That the bail having become finally charged, and their undertaking being
no longer conditional, such order of court did not give them legal authority to
surrender their 'principal in discharge of their liability. 
2d. That an answer filed by the bail setting forth such surrender of the prin­
cipal in accordance with the order so made by the court, does not show a. legal
defense to the action. 
3d. 'rha.t the court refusing to bear proof of such surrender, upon a motion
filed with their answer by the bail for exoneration, and overruling the motion,
and holding the facts so stated in their answer to be an insufficient defense, and
refusing to set aside the default, did not show an improper exercise by the
court of its legal discretion. Whetstone and Price v. Riley, 7 0. St. 514. 
SEC. 169. B,UL SUBSTITUTED FOR. MONEY DEPOSITED. . 
If money be deposited by the defendant in his discharge, bail

If, at any time before or after judgment age.inst the bail, proceed­
ings in error are commenced, on the judgment against the princi­
pal in the suit, in which their undertaking was taken, the court
may on motion, stay proceedings against such bail for a reasonable 
• time, on their paying all the costs that have accrued against them:
and if, on such proceedings; the judgment against the principal 
shall be reversed, and the principal discharged from said suit, the
bai\ shall be discharged from tho undertaking.

waived all objections to them. When the defendant excepts, the
sureties must justify upon notice, as bail on arrest. · The sheriff 
or other officer shall be-responaible for the sufficiency of the sure­

sively, at the option of the plaintiff; but only one of them shall be
taxed in the costs, unless otherwise ordered by the court. 
a. Where two write issue on one affidavit, in replevin, the issuing of the sec­
ond writ does not invalidate or render void the first, or the proceedings under
it. Rhodenbaugh e, Carey, l Wee. Law Monthly, 599. 
SEC. 188. WHEN OFFICER MAY BREAK OPEN BUILDINGS.

praised value thereof, that the property, or its appraised value in
money, shall be forthcoming to answer the judgment of the court in
the action; but if it shall appear to the court, that any part of said
property has been lost or destroyed by unavoidable accident, the
value thereof shall be remitted to the person so bound. 
a. Where the interest of the defendant in the property attached is less than·
the whole, the penalty of the bond will be double the appraised value of such
interest, and not double the value of the property. Stewart & Co. e, Hunter & 
Moore, ·1 Handy, 22. 
b. An undertaking on the part of a defendant, given to release property from
an attachment levied by a sheriff' or officer, is valid as a common law security,
though no appraisement is made, and the security is approved by the sheriff', in­
stead of the court, during the term of the court in which the attachment is re­
turnable. Bhelden e, Sharpless, 1 Wee. Law Monthly, 42.

certificates, with their seals of office attached. In all cases in
which the garnishee shall admit an indebtedness to the defendant,
and the court shall order the payment of the same, or any part
thereof, to the plaintiff, if the garnishee shall not pay the same ac­
cording to such order, execution may issue thereon as upon judg­

sheriff, coroner, constable, master commissioner, marshal of an in­
corporated city or village, or othen officer having any money, claim,
or other property of the defendant in his possession, or in which
the defendant may have any interest, shall bind the same from the
time of such service, and shall be a legal excuse to such officers to
the extent of the demand of the plaintiff, for not paying such 
money or delivering such claim, or property, to the defendant as by
law, or the terms of the process in his hands, he would otherwise

examination that, at or after the service of the order of attachment
and notice upon him, he was possessed of any property of the de­
fendant, or was indebted to him, the court may order the delivery
of such property and the payment of the amount owing by the
garnishee, into the court; or the court may permit the garnishee
to retain the property or the amount owing, upon the execution of
an undertaking to the plaintiff by one or more sufficient sureties,
to the effect, that the amount shall be paid, or the property forth­
coming, as the court may direct. 
a. In attachment proceedings, the garnishee is not, during the pendency of
the same, thereby necesaarily exempted from an exiRting liability to pay inter­ 
est upon his indebtedness t.o the defendant in attachment. Candee & Scribner 
e, Webster, 9 0. St.
b. A canse of exemption in such case, will not be presumed in favor of the 
garnishee, but must be shown to exist like any other defense. lb. 
SEC. 218. PLAINTIFF HAY APPEAR IN ACTION AGAINST GARNISHEE. 
If the garnishee fail to appear and answer, or if he appear and
answer, and his disclosure is not satisfactory to the plaintiff; or if
he fail to comply with the order of the court to deliver the prop­
erty and pay the money owing, into court, or give the undertaking
required in the preceding section, the plaintiff may proceed against 
him in an action, by filing a petition in his own name, as in other
cases, and causing a summons to be issued upon it; and thereupon
such proceedings may be bad as in other actions, and judgment
may be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, for the amount of the
property and credits of every kind of the defendant in the posses- 
sion of the garnishee, and for what shall appear to be owing by him
to the defendant, and for the costs of the proceedings against the
garnishee. If the plaintiff' proceed against the garnishee by ac­
tion, for the cause that his disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it
appear in · the action that such disclosure was incomplete, the plain­
tiff shall pay the costs of such action. The judgment in this ac­
tion may be enforced as judgments in other cases. When the 
claims of the plaintiffs in attachment are satisfied, the defendant
in attachment may, on motion, be substituted as the plaintiff' in the
judgment. 
SEC. 219. THE ACTION AGAINST OARNISHEB. 
Final judgment shall not be rendered against the garnishee un­
til the action against the defendant in attachment has been determ­
ined; and if in such action judgment be rendered for the de­
f'edant in attachment, the garnishee shall be discharged and re·
cover costs. If the plaintiff shall recover against the defendant
in attachment, and the garnishee shall deliver up all •the property,
moneys and credits of the defendant in his possession, and pay all
the moneys from him due, as the court may order, the garnishee
shall be discharged, and the costs of the proceedings against him
shall be paid out of the property and moneys so surrendered, or
as the court may think right and proper. 
SEC. 220. EFFECT OF JUDGHEXT FOR DEFENDANT. 
If judgment be rendered in the action for the defendant, the at­
tachment shall be discharged, and the property attached, or its pro­
ceeds, shall be returned to him. 
SEC. 221. PROCF;EDl~GS AFTER Jl"DGll~T FOR PLAIXTIFF. 
If judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall be satisfied as
follows : So much of the property remaining in the hands of the
officer, after applying the moneys arising from the sale of perish­
able property, and so much of the personal property and lands and
tenements, if any, whether held by legal or equitable title, as may
be necessary to satisfy the judgment, shall be sold by order of the
court, under the same restrictions and regulations as if the same
had been levied on by execution; and the money arising therefrom,
with the amount which may be recovered from the garnishee, shall 
be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs. H there be not
enough to satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand, and execu­
tion may issue thereon, for the residue, in all respects as in other
cases. Any surplus of the attached property, or its proceeds, shall
be returned to the defendant. 
a. The Code does not appear to have provided for a sale of mere evidences of -
indebtedness, such as notes, due-bills, or accounts, etc. The remedy provided is
to settle and collect, either through a receiver, or the sheriff acting as such.
Notice is to be given to the debton, and the debts collected by action. 'l'he
debtor is charged by the notice. Finnell v. Burt, 2 Handy, 203. 
6. The court is not authorized to order a sale of mere evidences of indebtedness
found in the hands of garnishees. lb. 
c. The court may order a sale of that class of securities which from their na­
ture can not be collected as debts, or which have been constituted articles of
sale, or framed for the purpose of being disposed of in the market, and which
have a marketable value. Ex gra. stocks, annuities for life or years, govern­
ment securities, or securities issued by corporations, where the principal is not
payable for a long period of time. If>.

of the attached property for which an undertaking may have beeu
given, and may proceed summarily on such undertaking to enforce
the delivery of the property, or the payment of such sum as may
be due upon the. undertaking, by rules and attachments as in cases 
of contempt. 
SEC. 223. OFFICER MAY REPOSSJalS BlMS.BLF OF ATTAOBBD PROPERTY. 
The court may order the sheriff to repossess himself, for the pur­
pose of selling it, [ of] any of the attached property, which may have
passed out of his hands without having been sold or converted into
money; and the sheriff shall, under such order, have the same
power to take the property, as he would have under an order of
attachment. 
SEC. 224. WHEN PROPERTY 18 CLAIMED BY A THIRD PBRSON-PROCEEDL~GS. 
H personal property which has been attached, be claimed by any
person other than the defendant, it shall be ~he duty of the officer
to have the validity of such claim tried, and such proceedings must 
be had thereon, with the like effect, as in case the property had
been seized upon execution, and claimed by a third person. 
SEC. 225. How P&IORITIU DBTBRlflNED.

or the same persons are made garnishees, the court on the motion
of any of the plaintiffs, may order a reference to ascertain and re­
port the amounts and priorities of the several attachments.

control of all subsequent proceedings under this chapter; and if,
after the issuing of the order, the defendant, being a. person, should
die, or a corporation, and its charter should expire by limitation,
forfeiture or otherwise, the proceedings shall be carried on ; but in
all such cases other than where the defendant was a. foreign cor­
p·oration, his legal representatives shall be made parties to the
action. 
SEC. 227. WHEX FGRTHER SECl:'RITY MAY DE REQUIRED OF THE PJ,ATXTIFF. 
The defendant may, at any time before judgment, after reason­
able n•ice to the plaintiff, move the court for additional security
on the part of the plaintiff; and if, on such motion, the court is
satisfied that the surety in the plaintiff's undertaking has removed
from this state, or is not sufficient for the amount thereof, it may
vacate the order of attachment, and direct restitution of any prop­
erty taken under it, unless in a reasonable time to be fixed by the
court, sufficient security is given by the plaintiff. 
SEC. 228. MoTION° TO DISCHARGE .A.TT • .\CHllE~T. 
The defendant may at anytime before judgment, upon reasona­
ble notice to the plaintiff, move to discharge an attachment, as to
the whole or any of the property attached, and the motion may be
heard, and decided by the court in any term or regular session
thereof; or the motion may be made, heard and decided by any

SEC. 231. ORDER-BY WHOM GRANTED. 
The attachment authorized by the last section, may be granted
by the court in which the action is brought, or by a judge thereof;
but before such action shall be brought, or such attachment shall
be granted, the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall make an oath
in writing, showing the nature and amount of the plaintiff's claim,

SEC. 238. CAUSES FOR AN INJUNCTION; 
When it appears by the petition, that the plaintiff' is entitled to
the relief demanded; and such relief, or any pa.rt thereof, consists
in restraining the commission or continuance of some act, the com­
mission or continuance of which, during the litigation, would pro­
duce great or irreparable injury to the plaintiff', or when, during
the litigation, it appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens,
or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be _done1 some act
in violation of the plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the 
action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary 
injunction may be granted to restrain such act. It may also be

any judge thereof, to vacate and modify the, same. The party ap­
plying for such vacation or modification shall give such notice to
the adverse party of the time and place at which such motion will
be heard, as the court or judge hearing the same shall deem rea­
sonable. The application may be made upon the petition and affi­
davits upon which the injunction is granted, or upon affidavits on
the part of the party enjoined, with or without answer. The order
of the judge allowing, dissolving or modifying an injunction, shall
be returned to the office of the clerk of the court in which the ac­
tion is brought and recorded, and obeyed as if made by the court.1

the information upon the point of law shall be given, and the court
may give its recollection as to the testimony on the point in dispute,
in the presence of, or after notice to, the parties or their counsel.

must present the facts as established by the evidence, and not the
evidence to prove them ; and they must be so presented as that

force the attendance of witnesses, to administer all necessary oaths
in the trial of th~ case, and to .. grant adjournments, as the court 
upon such trial. They must state the facts found, and the conclu­
sions of law, separately, and their decision must be given, and may
be excepted to and reviewed in like manner. The report of the
referees upon the whole issue stands as the decision of the court,
and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if 
the action had been tried by the court. When the reference is to
report the facts, the report has the effect of a special verdict.1 
SEC. 284. How REFEREES oaosss.

refer, and shall be filed with the clerk of the court with the other
papers in the case. 
SEC. 288. OATH OF REFEREE.

perior courts, in this state, either party shall have the right to except to the
opinion of the court on a motion to direct a nonsuit, to arrest the testimony
from the jury, and, also, in all cases of motion for a new trial by reason of any
supposed misdirection of the court to the jury, or by reason that the verdict,
or in case the jury be waived that the finding of the court, may be supposed to
be against law or evidence, so that said case may be removed by petition in
error ; and when a party to a suit in either of the aforesaid courts alleges an 
exception to the opinion or order, or judgment of such court, it shall be the
duty of the judge or judges of such court, concurring in such judgment, opin­ 
ion or order, if required by such party during the progress of the case, to sign
and seal a hill containing such exception or exceptions, before tho case pro­
ceeds; or, if the party consents, the signing and sealing of such bill of excep­
tions may be suspended until the trial is closed, but said hill of exceptions shall
be signed and sealed during the term, and such bill of exceptions, when signed
and sealed, shall, if the party desires it, be made part of tho record in such
suit. 55 Ohio Laws 81, sec. 4.

of objection do not sufficiently appear in the entry, the party ex­ 
cepting must reduce his exception to writing, and present it to the
court for its allowance. If true, it shall be the duty of a majority
of the judges composing the court, to allow and sign it, whereupon
it shall be filed with the pleadings as part of the record, but not 
spread at large on the journal. If the writing is not true, the
court shall correct it, or suggest the correction to he made, and it
shall then be signed as aforesaid.

A new trial is a re-examination in the same court of an issue of
fact after a verdict by a jury, report of a referee, or a decision by
the court. The former verdict, report or decision, shall be vacated 
• 
and a new trial granted, on the application of the party aggrieved,
for any of the following causes affecting materially the substantial 
rights of such party:
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, referee, or 
prevailing party, or any order of the court or referee, or abuse
of discretion, by which the party was prevented from having a fair 
trial:
2. Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party: 
3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have
guarded against : 
4. Excessive damages, appearing to have been given under the
influence of passion or prejudice : 
5. Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery, whether
too large, or too small, where the action is upon a contract, or for 
the injury or detention of property : 
6. That the verdict, report or decision is not sustained by suf­
ficient evidence, or is contrary to law: 
7. Newly discovered evidence matesial for the party applying,
which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and 
produced at the trial :
8. Error of law. occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the 
party making the application.' 
SEC. 298. FoR WHAT CAUSES NEW TRIAL WILL NOT DE GRANTED. 
A new trial shall not be granted on account of the smallness of the
damages in an action for an injury to the person or reputation, nor
in any other action where the damages shall equal the actual pecu-
niary injury sustained. - 
a. In actions of t.orts, when, from the nature of the injury received, and the
means by which it was produced, the damages may in a good measure be com­
puted by estimating the loss of time, and expenditures incurred, etc., it is the
duty of the court, in a proper case, when the jury have found that the injury
was produced by the act of the defendant, t.o set aside the verdict, and grant a
new trial, if a fair compensation for the injury has not been awarded And 
section 298 of the Code does not Iimit the power of the court, in such a. case.

term at which the verdict, report of referee, or decision was ren­
dered or made, the application may be made by petition filed as in 
other cases not later than the second term after the discovery; on
which a. summons shall issue, be returnable and served, or publica­
tion made as prescribed in section seventy-two. The facts stated
in the petition shall be considered as denied without answer, and

governed in all respects by the law relating to sales on execution.

of a. sale according to the order, the case may be redocketed on
the application of either party, and when so redocketed, it shall
stand in all respects as if it had remained on the docket. (As

taken, and the names of the persons interested, if known to the
applicant ; and if not known, such general description as he can 
give of such persons, as heirs, devisees, alienees, or otherwise.
The petition shall also state the names of the witnesses to be
examined and the interrogatories to be propounded to each; that
the applicant expects to be a party to an action in a court of this
state, in which such testimony will, as he believes, be material,
and the obstacles preventing the immediate commencement of the
action, where the applicant expects to be the plaintiff. 
SEC. 365. ORDER FOR EXAMINATION OF WITN&SSES.

therein. The witnesses shall be examined upon the interroga­
tories of the applicant, and upon cross in serrogatories, where
they are required to be prepared, and no others shall be pro­

affirmative relief to which he may be entitled. In an action
against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render 
judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed
against the others whenever a several judgment may be. proper.
The court may also dismiss the petition with costs in favor of one
or more defendants, in case of unreasonable neglect, on the part of
the plaintiff', to serve the summons on other defendants, or to pro­
ceed in the cause against the defendant or defendants served.

default, take the account, hear the proof, or assess the damages;
or may, with the like assent, refer the same to a referee or master

SEC. 424. PREFERENCE GIVEN TO EXECUTIONS. 
When two or more writs of execution, against the same debtor,
shall be sued out during the term in which judgment was ren­
dered, or within ten days thereafter, and when two or more writs
of execution, against the same debtor, shall be delivered to the 
officer on the same day, no preference shall be given to either of
such writs; but if a sufficient sum of money be not made to satisfy
all executions, the amount made shall be distributed to the several
creditors in proportion to the amount of their respective demands. 
In all other cases, the writ of execution first deli vered to the officer
shall be first satisfied. And it shall be the duty of the officer to
indorse on every writ of execution, the time when he received the
same; but nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to
affect any preferable lien, which one or more of the judgments,
on which execution issued, may have on the lands of the judg­

If the officer, by virtue of any writ of execution, issued from any
oovt of record in this state, shall levy the same on any goods and 
chattels claimed by any person other than the defendant, it shall
be the duty of said officer, forthwith to give notice in writing, to
some justice of the peace of the county, in which shall be set forth
the names of the plaintiff and defendant, together with the name
of the claimant; and &t the same time he shall furnish the said jus­
tice of the peace with a schedule, of the property claimed. And it
shall be the duty of such justice of the pea.ce, immediately upon
the receipt of such notice and schedule, to make an entry of the
same upon his docket, and issue a writ of summons, directed to the
sheriff, or any constable of the county, commanding him to sum­
mon five disinterested men, having the qualifications of electors,
who shall be named in said summons, to appear before him, the said
justice, at the time and place therein mentioned, which time shall
not be more than· three days after the date of said writ, to try and
determine the right of the claimant to the property in controversy. 
And it shall be the duty of the claimant to give two da.ys' nouce
in writing, to the plaintiff or other party, for whose benefit such
execution was issued and levied as aforesaid, his agent or attorney,
if within the county, of the time and place of such trial; and he
shall, moreover, prove, to the satisfaction of said justice that such
notice was given, or that the same could not be given by reason
of the absence of the party, his agent, or attorney. 
SEC. 427. PROCEEDINGS WHBN GOODS LEVIBD ON ARB OLAIMBD BY A THIRD
PERSON. 
The jury, summoned as aforesaid, shall be sworn to try and de­
termine the right of the claimant to the property in controversy,
and a true verdict to give according to the evidence. If the jury
shall find the right to said goods and chattels, or any part thereof, 
M> be in the claimant, they shall aleo find the value thereof, and the
justice shall render judgment upon such finding of the jury for 
the claimant, that he recover his coats against the plaintiff in exe­
cution, or other party to the same, for whose benefit the execution 
issued, and also that he have restitution of nch goods and chat­ 
tels, or·any part thereof, according to the finding of the jury; but 
if the right to the said goods and chattels, and every part thereof,
shall not be in the claimant according to the finding of said jury,
then the said justice shall render judgment on such finding, in fa­
vor of the plaintiff in execution, or other party, for whose benefit
the execution issued, and against said claimant for costs, and award
execution thereon. If the jury shall fail to agree, and be dis­
charged, costs shall be taxed, to abide the final event of the pro­
ceeding before said justice, and another jury shall be summoned in
like manner as before. Said justice of the peace, in the taxation
of costs accruing by reason of such claim and trial, shall allow
each juror, summoned and sworn, the sum of fifty cents; and for
the sheriff, constable, or other officer, and witnesses, and for him­
self, he shall tax such fees as are allowed by law to each respect­ 
ively, for like services rendered in other cases; such judgment for
the claimant (unless an undertaking shall be executed, as provided
in the next section,) shall be a justification of the officer in return­
ing "no goods" to the writ of execution, by virtue of which the .
levy has been made, as to such part of the goods and chattels as
were found to belong to such claimant. [ As amended, March 10, 
SEC. 57 0. L. 31.J 
a. Proceedings for a trial of the right of property, resulting in an order of
restitution and a return of the property pursuant to the order, are no bar to an
action by the claimant against the officer, to recover damages for the seizure
and detention of the property. Abbey "· Searles & Rider, 4 0. St. 598. 
b. Where property is levied upon by an officer, and is claimed by a. third
person, and the right to the property is tried before a justice, and a verdict
found against the right of claimant, the claimant can not sustain a suit against
the officer to recover the goods, or their- value in damages. Po.tty e, Mn.nsfield,

If the jury shall find the property or any part thereof to be in
the claimant, and the plaintiff in execution shall, at any time within
three days after such trial, tender to the sheriff or other officer
having such property in his custody on execution, an undertaking
with good and sufficient sureties, payable to such claimant, in
double the amount of the value of such property as assessed by the
jury, to the effect that they will pay all damages sustained by rea­ 
son of the detention or sale of such property, then the sheriff or
other officer shall deliver said undertaking to claimant, and proceed 
to sell such property, as if no such trial of the right of property
had taken place, and shall not be liable t~ the claimant therefor. 
a. Where property is seized on execution, and claimed by a third person!
and the right of property is tried under sections 426 and 427 of the Code, and a 
verdict rendered by the jury, in favor of the claimant, and thereupon the plain­
tiff in execution 'executes and delivers an undertaking to the sheriff, as pre­
scribed in section 428 of the Code, and the sheriff delivers the .same to the 
claimant who accepts U; held, that after such proceedings, and the acceptance .
of such undertaking, the claimant can not resort to replevin to take the prop­
erty out of the hands of the sheriff. Moses v. Brashear, 2 Handy, 36.

tue of an execution, levy upon any goods and chatteis which shall
remain upon his hands unsold, for want of bidders, for the want of
time to advertise and sell, or any other reasonable cause, the of­
ficer may, for his own security, take of the defendant an undertaking,
with security, in such sum as he may deem sufficient, to the effect
that the said property shall be delivered to the officer holding an
execution for the sale of the same, at t~ time and place appointed
by said officer, either by notice given in writing to said defendant
in execution, or by advertisement published in a newspaper printed
in the county, naming therein the day and place of sale. If the
defendant shall fail to deliver the goods and chattels at the time
and place mentioned in the notice to him given, or to pay to the
officer holding the execution the full value of said goods and chat­
tels, or the amount of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given 
as aforesaid, shall be considered as broken, and may be proceeded
on as in other cases. 
SEC. 430. NOTICE OF SALE OF GOODS-INVENTORY TO Bla TAKBS-ANOTHER WRIT

The officer who levies upon goods and chattels, by virtue of an
execution issued by a court of record, before he proceeds to sell
the same, shall cause public notice to be given of the time and
place of sale, for at least ten days before the day of sale. The
notice shall be given by advertisement, published in some news­
paper printed in the county, or in case no newspaper be printed
therein, by setting up advertisements in five public places in the
county ; two advertisements shall be put up in the township where
the sale is to be held. And where goods and chattels levied upon,
can not be sold for want of bidders, the officer making such return
shall annex to the execution a true and perfect inventory· of such
goods and chattels ; and the plaintiff' in such execution may there­
upon sue out another writ pf execution, directing the sale of the
property levied upon a1 aforesaid ; but such goods and chattels
shall not be sold, unless the time and place of sale be advertised,

request of the person entitled to the benefit thereof, his agent or
attorney, add thereto a. command to the officer to whom such writ
shall be directed, that, if the property remaining in his hands not
sold shall, in his opinion, be insufficient to satisfy the judgment,
he shall levy the same upon the lands and tenements, goods and

h. Tho court has the power when the appraisement of property was made
probably under some misapprehension of the location of the property, or in
ignorance of its value, and where justice to the parties manifestly requires it,
to set aside, and order n new appraisement to be made. Bates e, Junction R.

sheriff has deposited n. copy of the valuation in the clerk's office. Merritt & 
Kempton v. Borden, 3 Law Gaz., 348. 
b. Such a defect, after tho confirmation of the sale, would not impair the

so levied upon is sufficient to satisfy the execution, with costs, the 
judgment on which such execution issued, shall not operate, as a
lien, on the residue of the debtor's estate, to the prejudice of any
other judgment creditor. But no tract of land shall be sold for
less than two thirds of the value returned in. the inquest; and
nothing in this section contained, shall in any wise extend to affect
the sale of lands by the state, but all lands therein, the property
of individuals, indebted to the state for any debt or taxes, or in 
any other manner, except for loans heretofore authorized by the
legislature, shall be sold without valuation, for the discharge of
such debt, or taxes, agreeably to the laws for such case ma.de and

Lands and tenements taken in execution shall not be sold until
the officer cause public notice of the time and place of sale, to be 
given for at least thirty days before the day of sale, by advertise­
ment in some newspaper printed and of general circulation in the
county; or in case no newspaper be printed in the county, in
some newspaper of general circulation therein, and by putting up
an advertisement upon the court-house door, and in five other 
public places in the county, two of which shall be in the township
where such lands and tenements lie. Where such advertisement
is made in a newspaper published weekly, it shall be sufficient to
insert the same in five consecutive numbers thereof; but wherever
there shall be published, both a daily and weekly edition of the
newspaper selected for such advertisement, and the circulation of
the daily in the county shall exceed that of the weekly, it shall be
sufficient for the officer to publish the said advertisement in the
daily once a week for five consecutive weeks, before the day of
sale, each insertion to be on the same day of the week: provided,

not exceed the cost of publishing the same in a. weekly newspaper. 
All sales ma.de without such advertisement shall be set aside, on
motion, by the court to which the execution is returnable. [ As.
amended April 6, 1859. 56 0. L. 242.]

conformity to the provisions of this title, the court shall direct
the clerk to make an entry on the journal, that the court is satis­

good and sufficient a deed of conveyance of the lands and tene­
ments sold, as the person, or persons against whom such writ, or
writs of execution were issued, could have made of the same, at,
or any time after they became liable to the judgment. The deed
shall be sufficient evidence of the legality of such sale, and the 
\ proceedings therein, until the contrary be proved, and shall vest
in the purchaser as good and as perfect an estate in the premises 
therein mentioned, as was vested in the party at, or after the time,
when such lands and tenements became liable to the satisfaction 
of the judgment. And such deed of conveyance, to be made by
the sheriff, or other officer, shall recite the execution, or execu­
tions, or the substance thereof, and the names of the parties, the
amount, and date of term of rendition of each judgment, by
virtue whereof the said lands and tenements were sold as afore­
said; and shall be executed, acknowleged, and recorded as is, or
may be provided by law, to perfect the conveyance of real estate
in other cases. 
SEC. 439. PRINTER'S FEE MAY BE REQUIRED IN ADVANCE. 
The officer who levies upon goods and chattels, or lands and ten­
ements, or who is charged with the duty of selling the same by vir­
tue of any writ of execution, may refuse to publish a notice of the
sale thereof by advertisement in a. newspaper, until the party for
whose benefit such execution issued, his agent, or attorney, shall
advance to such officer, so much money as will be sufficient to dis­
charge the fees of the printer, for publishing such notice. 
SEC. 440. OFFICER MUST DIDIAND PRINTER'S FEE. 
Before any officer shall be excused from giving the notification
mentioned in the last section, he shall demand of the party for

levy on real estate to satisfy the same, and either of the judgment
creditors in whose favor one or more of said executions is issued,
shall require the sheriff, or other officer, to make a. separate levy
tp satisfy his execution, or executions, it shall be the duty of the
sheriff, or other officer, to levy said executions, or so many thereof
as may be required, on separate parcels of the real property of the
judgment debtor, or debtors; giving to the officer making the levy
on behalf of the creditor, whose execution may! by the provisions
of this chapter, be entitled to a preference, the choice of such part
of the real property of the judgment debtor, or debtors, as will be
sufficient at two thirds of the appraised value, to satisfy the same.
And in all cases where two or more executions, which are entitled 
to no preference over each other, are put into the hands of the
same officer, it shall be the duty of the officer, when required, to
levy the same on separate parcels of the real property of the judg­
ment debtor, or debtors, when, in the opinion of the appraisers, the
same may be divided without material injury: and if the real prop­
erty of said debtors will not be sufficient, at two thirds of its ap­
praised value, to satisfy all the executions chargeable thereon, such
part of the same shall be levied on to satisfy each execution, as 
. 
will bear the same proportion in value to the whole, as the amount 
due on the execution, bears to the amount of all the executions
chargeable thereon, a.s near as may be, according to the appraised 
value of each separate parcel of said real property.

ance of the same, any succeeding sheriff, or other officer, on re­
ceiving a certificate from the court from which execution issued for
the sale of said lands and tenements, signed by the clerk, by order
of said court, setting forth that sufficient proof has been made to
the court, that such sale was fairly and legally made; and, on tender
of the purchase money, or if the same, or any part thereof be paid,
then, on proof of such payment and tender of the balance, if any,
may execute to the said purchaser, or purchasers, or his or their
legal representatives, a. deed of conveyance of the said lands and
tenements so sold. Such deed shall be as goodand valid in law,
and have the same effect, as if the sheriff, or other officer, who made
the sale, had executed the same. 
SEC. 445. DISPOSITION OF MONEY AF"l'BR SATISFYING EXECUTION, 
If on any sale made as aforesaid, there shall be in the hands of

in execution or his legal representatives. 
SEC. 446. REVERSAL OP JUDGMENT NOT TO .AFFECT TITLE. 
If any judgment or judgments, in satisfaction of which any lands
or tenements are sold, shall at any time thereafter be reversed, such
reversal shall not defeat or affect the title of the purchaser or
purchasers; but in such case, restitution shall be made by the
judgment creditor of the moneys, for which such lands or tene­
ments were sold, with la.wful interest from the day of sale.

No judgment heretofore rendered, or which hereafter may be
rendered, on which execution shall not have been taken out and
levied, before the expiration of one year next after its rendition, shall

any other bona fide judgment creditor. But in all eases where
[judgment] has been or may be rendered in the district or supreme
court, and a special mandate awarded to the court of common pleas,
to carry the same into execution, the lien of the judgment creditor 
shall continue for one year after the first day of the term of the
court of common pleas, to which such mandate may be directed.
Nothing in this subject contained, shall be construed to defeat the
lien of any judgment creditor, who shall fail to take out execution
and cause a levy to be made as herein provided, when such failure 
shall be occasioned by appeal, proceedings in error, injunction, or
by a vacancy in the office of sheriff and coroner, or the inability
of such officer, until one year after such disability shall be removed. 
In all cases where real estate has been, or may liereafter be,
taken on execution snd appraised, and twice advertised and offered
for sale, and shall remain unsold for want of bidders, it shall be the

two or more persons are jointly and severally bound, and it shall
be made to appear to the court, by parol or other testimony, that
one or more of said persons so bound, signed the same as surety 
or bail for his or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the
clerk of said court, in· recording the judgment thereon, to certify
which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which are sure­
ties or bail. And the clerk of the court aforesaid, shall issue ex­
ecution on such judgment, commanding the sheriff or other officer,
to cause the money to be made of the goods aad chattels, lands
and tenements, of the principal debtor, but for want of sufficient
property of the principal debtor, to make the same, that he cause
the same to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tene­ 
ments of the surety or bail. In all cases, the property, both per~ 
sonal and real, of the principal debtor, wit~in the jurisdiction of
the court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of the

persons holding the legal estate, or the person, or persons having
any lien on, or interest in the same, without controversy as to the
interest of such person, or persons holding such legal estate, or
interest therein, or lien on the same, the receiver may be ordered

tion and prevents judgment. Hobbs v. Beckwith, 6 0. St. 252.

which demurrer was overruled, and the defendant by leave answered. The

restitution to the plaintiff in error of the money by him received
under the judgment. 
a. Ko rule is prescribed as to the grounds upon which the leave is to be
granted, or refused; and it is admitted that the matter is confided to the dis­
cretion of the court or judge. Valley Bank e, West & Co., 2 Handy, 61. 
b. The tribunal that decided the controversy in the first instance and ren­
dered the judgment, is to grant or refuse the leave to enforce the judgment. IF,, 
e, That the grounds upon which, under the ,wt regulating appeals to the dis­
trict court (Swan's Rev. Stat. 717), damages are imposed on the a.ffimumce of
the judgment of the court below, form no guide by which the court can con­
strue section 522 of the Code. lb. 
d. When the amount undisputed is large, and that litigated on error is
small, and they are susceptible of separation as distinct claims; it seems un­
just to withhold from the party the undisputed. part of his demand, until that
litigated can be determined in a court of error. lb. 
e. Where the claim litigated on error was statutory damages, on a bill of ex­
change of $5,000, and the damages were only $300, the court allowed execu­
tion for the $5,000, but required an agreement to be filed by the plaintiff' to 
stay execution and any other proceedings as to the damages, and the costs in
the genera.I term of the superior court. lb. 
SEC. 523. WHEN PROCEEDINGS IN ERROR HUST BE COMMENCED.

plained of: or, in case the person entitled to such proceeding be
an infant, a married woman, a person of unsound mind, or impris­
oned, within three years as aforesaid, exclusive of the time of 
such disabi ity. 
SEC. 524. STAY OF EXECUTION ON JUDGMENT OF JUSTICE OF THE PEACE-UNDER·
TAKING. 
No proceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify any judgment ren­
dered, or final order made, by a justice of the peace, shall operate
as a stay of execution, unless the clerk of the court of common
pleas shall take a written undertaking to the defendant, executed
on the part of the plaintiff in error, by oae or more sufficient sure­
ties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay all the costs which have
accrued, or may accrue, on such proceedings in error, together with
the amount of any judgment that may be rendered against such
plaintiff in error, either on the further trial of the case, after the
judgment of the court below shall have been set aside, or reversed,
or upon and after the a.fli.rmance thereof in the court of common
pleas. The person entitled to such proceeding, 1ha.ll have the
same time for prosecuting the same, before he is barred, as is pro­
vided in the last section, unless the said judgment has been paid
off, or satisfied prior to the commencement of such proceeding. 
SEC. 525. WHEN COURT KAY ORDER STAY OF EXECUTION.

When a judgment or final order has been or shall be reversed,
either in whole or in part, in the court of common pleas, the dis­
trict court, or supreme court, the court reversing the same shall
proceed to render such judgment as the court below should have
rendered, or remand the cause to the court below for such judg- 
. ment ; and the court reversing such judgment or final order, shall
not issue execution in causes that are removed before them on er­
ror, on which they pronounced judgment, as aforesaid, but shall send
a special mandate to the court below, as the case may require, to
award execution thereupon ; and such court to which such special
mandate is sent, shall proceed in such cases in the same manner as 
if such judgment or final order had been rendered therein ; and on
motion, and good cause shown, it may suspend any execution made
returnable before it by order of the court of common pleas, the
district court, or supreme court, in the same manner as if such exe­
cution had been issued from its own court, but such power shall not
extend further than to stay proceedings, until the matter can be
further heard by the court of common pleas, the district court, or
supreme court, as the case may be: Provided, this section shell
not apply to judgments of justices of the peace. [ As amended,

«. Wher~ the judgment of U1e court below is simply affirmed by the supreme
court, the clerk of the court below, on being satisfied of the nffirml\Ilce, either
by journal entry or otherwise, may proceed to issue execution in the original
cause, without waiting for a mandate or other requisition, to carry the judg­
ment into execution. Howard v . .Abbey, 1 Wes. Law Monthly, 278. 
SEc. 527. Cosrs IN aauon. 
When a judgment or final order is reversed, the plaintiff in error 
• 
shall recover his costs, and when reversed in part, and affirmed in
part, costs shall be equally divided between the p~rties. 
a. Where a case is dismissed for wo.nt of jurisdiction of the subject matter,
it is error in the court to render judgment against each party for his own costs,
such judgments o.nd the proceedings to reverse them, are ex parte; and the
statutory provision as to costs, upon reversal in error, does not apply. Where
the proceedings are of an adversary character, the statutory rule applies. Nor­

SEC. 529. RENDERING JUDGHBNT PRBMA.TURELY A CLERICAL MISPRISION. 
Rendering judgment before the action stood for trial according

Writs of error and certiorari to reverse, vacate or modify judg­
ments, or final orders, in civil cases, are abolished, but courts. shall
have the same power to compel, complete and perfect transcripts
of the proceedings containing the judgment or final order sought
to be reversed, to be furnished, as they heretofore had under writs
of error and certiorari. 
a. The writ of certiorari is abolished, in civil cases, and petition in error
substituted. Hobbs v. Beckwith, 6 0. St. 252. 
b. A proceeding to reverse an order made by a state judge discharging a pris­
oner on habeas corpus, is, in its nature, a civil proceeding, and must be by peti­ 
wm in error, and not by certiorari Ex po.rte Collier, 6 0. St. 55.

herein provided to the court of common pleas, be· affirmed, it shall
be the duty of such court to render judgment against the plaintiff
in error, for the costs of suit, and to award execution therefor;
and the court shall thereupon order its clerk to certify its decision 
in the premises, to the justice, that the judgment affirmed may be
enforced, as if such proceedings in error had not been taken ; or 
such court may award execution to carry into effect the judgment
of such justice, in the same manner as if such judgment had been
rendered in the court of common pleas. 
SEC. 532. PROCEEDIXGS WHEN JUDG)IENT OF JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS RE·

When the proceedings of a justice of the peace are taken on
error .to the court of common pleas, in manner aforesaid, and the
judgment of such justice shall be reversed, or set aside, the
court shall render judgment of reversal, and for the costs that have 
accrued up to that time, in favor of the plaintiff in error, and award
execution therefor; and the cause shall be retained by the court
for trial and final judgment, as in cases of appeal. 
a. Where a justice of the peace postponed rendering judgment upon a ver­
dict to a subsequent day, and for this reason the judgment W¥ reversed by the
common pleas court, the common pleas must retain the cause for trial and final
judgment. Robinson v. Kions & Rowe, 4 0. St..,593.

rendered, or which may hereafter be rendered, in any chancery
proceeding pending at the time this· Code takes effect, may be re­
viewed in the same manner, and within the same time, as if this
Code had not taken effect; and all suits in chancery, pending at

parent to the court that the defense is insisted on in good faith, and a fair 
p1·i111a facie case is established by the defendant in the original action, then
the judgment should be set aside, and the case set down for trial. Pomeroy e,
Drake, 1 Wes. Law Monthly, 28j. 
b. A judgment entered upon a warrant of attorney will be set aside, and the
cause set down for trial, on motion of the defendant, when it appears that the
motion is made in good faith, and, that prima facie a defense exists, if the de­

SEC. 54 7. JUDGMENT AG.U!\ST SECURITY. 
After final judgment has been rendered in an action, in which
security for costs has been given, as required by this chapter, the

der, malicious prosecution, assault, assault and battery, false im­
prisonment, criminal conversation, or seduction, actions for nuis­
ance, or a.ga.inst a justice of the peace for misconduct in office, if
the. damages assessed be under five dollars, the plaintiff shall not
recover any costs.

titled to judgment; but as to costs, if the recovery be less than one hundred
dollars, judgment for the plaintiff's costs can not be rendered, unless the
amount of the plaintiff's claim is found by the jury to be more than one hun­
dred dollars, and is reduced by the allowance of a counter-claim or set-off to
less than one hundred dollars. lb. 
d. The act giving justices of the peace exclusive original jurisdiction of any
sum not exceeding one hundred dollars, did not abrogate sec. 552 of the Code,
as to the recovery of costs in cases where, from tbe verdict, it appears that the
amount in controversy did not exceed one hundred dollars. lo.

pleas, the plaintiff' can not recover costs if the verdict is for less than one hun­
dred dollars. Van Buskirk e. Dunlap, 2 Wes. Law Monthly, 125.

amount of the plaintiff's claim, as found by the court or jury, determines tho
right to recover costs. lo.

The writ of .mandamus may be issued to any inferior tribunal,
corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act, 
which the law specially enjoins as a. duty resulting from an office,
trust or station. But though it may require an inferior tribunal to
exercise its judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any of its
functions, it can not control judicial discretion. 
~EC. 5i0. IN WHAT CASES NOT TO ISSt:E. 
This writ may not be issued in any case, where there is a plain
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. It may
issue on.the information of the party beneficially interested. 
a. The writ of mandamus does not lie unless the party applying has no
other adequate legal remedy. Shelby v. Hoffman, 7 0. ~t. 450.

formed, or show cause before the court whence the writ issued, at
a specified time and place, why he has not done so; and that he,
then and there, return the writ, with his certificate of having done
as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a similar
form, except that the words requiring the defendant to show cause
why he has not done as commanded, must .be omitted. 
SEC. 5i2. WHEN PBREMPTORY WRIT ALLOWED. 
When the right to require the performance of the act is clear,
and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not per­
forming it, a peremptory mandamus may be allowed in the first
instance. In all other cases, the alternative writ must be first 
issued. 
SEC. 5i3. MoTION FOR WRIT. 
The motion for the writ must be made upon affidavit, and the

judgment or decree was for the payment of money, either person­
ally or otherwise, the appellant shall be adjudged to pay to the ap­
pellee, or party delayed of payment by the appeal, damages at the
rate of five per cent. on the amount of the payment adjudged or
decreed in the court below, unless the appellate court shall be sat­
isfied that there was reasonable and proper ground for the appeal;
and in any such case, where the court shall be satisfied that the
appeal was vexatious, and for the purpose of delay merely, the
damages adjudged shall be at the rate of ten per cent.; in all other 
I 
cases, including those where the judgment or decree is for nominal
damages, and costs, or costs only, unless the appellate court shall
be satisfied that there was reasonable and probable groun4 for the
appeal, there shall be adjudged to the nppellec, or party affected
by the appeal, damages in such specific sum as may be deemed

In case notice of appeal is entlred as aforesaid, the court may,
on motion of the party entering such notice, on laying him under
such reasonable restrictions and terms as they may judge necessary
for the security of the adverse party, direct execution to be stayed
for thirty days: Provided, that in no case shall administrators or
executors and guardians, who may have given bond in this state,
with sureties, according to law, be compelled to give bond and se­
curity, in order to perfect an appeal, as i~ above provided; and in
such cases the clerk, if not otherwise directed, shall, at the expira­
tion of thirty days from the rising. of the court, make out a tran­
script, which, together with the papers and pleadings filed in the
cause, he shall transmit to the clerk of the district court, accord­
ing to the provisions of this act, in other cases of appeal. 
a. The statute exempts nn administrator from giving bond as required of
other parties; in order to perfect his right to an appeal, it is necessary for him
to use due diligence in porf ecting his appeal, by causing the transcript and pa­
pers to be filed at the next term of the district court after the end of the term
of tho court below, if the period ot thirty days shall have elapsed since tho end 
of such term; and that he can not be permitted to delay perfecting his appeal for
an indefinite period, for such n practice would mislead parties, and tend to pro­
tract liti.~ation unreasonably. The appellant having suffered the April term of
this court to pass by without causing his transcript to be filed, it wns too late 
to file it at the September term, and the appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
