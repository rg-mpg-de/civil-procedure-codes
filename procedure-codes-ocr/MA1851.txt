of' the
Proceedings,

the

Courts
of this
Commonwealtlh.
BE it
enacted
by
the Senate
anl House
of Representa-
tives,
in General
Court
assembled,
and by
the authority
of
the
same,
as
follows
:
SECT.
1.
There
shall
be
only three
divisions
of
personal
actiolls:
First.-AcT
IONS
OF
CONTRACT,
which
shall
include
those
now known as actions
of assumpsit, covenant, and debt,
except
for penalties.
Second.-ACTIONS OF TORT, which shall include those
now known
as actions of trespass, trespass
on the case, tro-
ver, and all actions
for penalties.
T/Lird.-ACTIONS OF REPLEVIN.
SECT. 2. The
forms of declaring
in personal
actions,
which have heretofore been
used in this Commonwealth,
shall be changed in the following
particulars :
First, the
action
shall be
named in
conformity
with
the
above
described
division, 
Secondly, no
averment shall be made
which the law does
not
require to be proved.
Thirdly, only the substantive facts
necessary to consti-
tute
the
cause
of
action
shall
be
stated,
without
unnecessary 
verbiage, and with substantial
certainty.
Fourthly, one count
and no more shall be inserted for 
each
cause of action, but any number of
breaches may be
assigned in each count,
and when the nature of the case
shall require
it, breaches may be assigned in
the alternative.
Fifthly,
any number
of counts for different
causes of ac-
tion,
belonging
to
the
same
division
of
actions,
may
be 
inserted
in the
same
declaration.
Actions
of contract
and
actions
of tort shall not be joined ; but when it is deemed
doubtful to
which of those classes of actions
a particular
cause
of
action belongs,
a
count in
contract
may be
joined 
with
a
count
in
tort,
averring
that
both
are
for
one
and
the
same cause of action.
Sixthly, the common counts shall not be used unitedly,
as
heretofore,
but
each
one
of
those
counts,
in
the
form 
hereafter prescribed,
may be used, when the natural import
of its terms correctly describes the cause
of action.
Seventhly, a count
on an account annexed, in the form
hereafter
prescribed,
may
be
used
in
an
action
of
contract, 
when two or more items
are claimed, which would be cor-
rectly described
by either of the common counts, according
to the natural import
of its terms.
Eighthly,
the form of
declaration heretofore
used
in the 
action
of trover is abolished, and in place thereof shall be
used the
form hereafter prescribed.
Ninthly, all written instruments, except policies of in-
surance, shall be declared on, or availed of, in the
answer 
or subsequent allegation,
by setting out a copy thereof,
or
of such
part as is relied on, with proper averments to
describe

the cause of action or the
defence. If the whole
contract shall
not be set out, a copy thereof,
or the original,
shall be filed as the court shall
direct; and, where it may
be necessary,
the copy
so
filed
shall.be
part
of the
record,
if the
court
shall
so order,
as if
oyer
had been
granted
of a
deed declared on
according to the common
law, but no
profert, or excuse therefor,
need be inserted in
any declaration.
Tenthly,
when
a
bond,
or other
conditional
obligation,
contract,
or grant,
shall
be declared
on,
or when
any.
condi-
tional
obligatioi:,
contract
or grant
shall
be availed
of
in

deemed
part
of

or

and

breaches
relied
on
shall
be
assigned;
and
the

thereon,
shall
be averred
by him
to

thereof
stated.

in clear
and
precise
terms,
every
substantive
fact
intended
to

count of the declaration separately, or shall declare the defendant's

ignorance of the fact, so that he can neither ad-
mit, nor deiy, but leaves the plaintiff to prove the same.
SECT. 23. The alswer
shall clearly distinguish between
a denial
upon
the
personal
knowledge,
and
a
denial
upon
the information and belief of the defendant.

count
on anl
account
annexed,
the
defendant
shall
answer
on,,,,,O

or account amexed, but he may make one and the same
allegation or denial concerning any number of items to
which such allegation or denial is applicable, specifying the
number of
the items thus answered together, when less
than the whole. If the defendant shall deny that any item is
due or payable, or that lie
owes the plaintiff as alleged, lie
shall state all the substantive grounds on which lie intends
to rest such denial, and shall specify whether some, and
what part,
or the whole of' such item or demand, is denied.
SECT. 25. In all cases in which a denial is made by
atn al sver aflidavit or otherwise, concerling a time, sum,
quantity or place alleged, the
party deniying shall declare
whether such denial is applicable to every time, sum, quantity

or place, or niot, and if not, what time, sum, quantity
or place lie admits.
SF.CT. 26, To raise an issue in law, the aniswer shall
contain
the
statement
that
the
defendant
demurs
to
the
declaration,
or to some one or
more counts therein,
as the
case
may be, and
shall assign
specially
the causes
of demurrer.
SECT.
27.
The
answer
shall
set
forth,
in
clear
and
pre- 
cise
terms, each substantive
fact intended to
be relied upon 
in
avoidance of the action ;
and when the answer shall
set
up the statute of limitations,
or the statute of
fravds, or
any other legal bar,
the defendant shall
not be deprived of
the benefit
of such defence by
reason of his not denying
the
facts set fbrth in the
declaration.
SECT.
28.
If
the
answer
shall
contain
new
matter
ill
avoidance of the
action, the plaintiff shall,
within twenty 
days, or such further time
as the court may allow, on
cause
shown,
file his replication
thereto, wherein he
shall deny,
in clear and precise
terms, each substantive
fact intended to
be
denied, which is alleged
in the answer by way of
avoidance,

or shall
declare his ignorance, so
that he can neither
admit nor deny, but leaves
the defendant to prove
the same ;
and the
replication shall clearly
distinguish between a de-
nial upon the
personal knowledge,
and a denial
upon the information

and
belief of.' the plaintiff.
And the plaintiff
may allege,
in clear and precise terms,
any substantive
facts by way
of avoidance of
the new matter
contained
in the answer;
and if the plaintiff
shall not, within twenty
days, file
his replication
or an order
for further
time,
a nonsuit
shall

be entered
by the clerk.
SECT.
29.
If the
plaintiff
shall
allege
in his
replication 
any
new
matter
by
way
of
avoidance,
such
new
matter
shall
be
deemed 
to
be
denied
by
the
defendant
;
but
if
the
defendant
desires
to confess
and
avoid
the same
by further
allegations,
lie may do so
within ten days
after the filing
of
the replication.
SECT.
30.
The
replication
may
raise
an
issue
in
law,
by the statement, that
the plaintiff demurs
to the answer, 
or to so
much thereof as applies
to one or more counts
in
the declaration, as
the case may be, assigning
specially the
causes
of such demurrer
; and
in like manner
either party
may demur
to the allegation of the
other party. But no
defect of form merely,
either in the declaration
or subse-
quent allegation, shall
ever be assigned
as a cause of de-
murrer.
The opposite
party
shall be deemed
to join
in de-
murrer, if
he shall not
amend, which
lie may
do, within
ten
days, upon such terms as
the court may allow by
a general

rule.
SEcT.

Demurrers"
may
be
for
the
following,
among 
other
causes

the
declaration,

he has investigated
the cause of action
declared on,
or the
defence set forth, as the case may be, and is of opinion that
it is a fit subject for judicial inquiry and trial ; and when
any demurrer shall be taken, the attorney, if any,
shall

thereto ; and any necessary party may be brought before
the court, and joined as a plaintiff or defendant, in the
manner provided in the one hundredth chapter of the Revised

Statutes.

The
cause
of action
shall

be made to appear to the
court, that in point of fact it is
the cause of action relied on by the plaintiff when the ac-
tion was commenced, however the same may be misde-
scribed ; and the adjudication of the court allowing the
amendment, shall be conclusive evidence of the identity of
the cause of action. But no subsequent attaching creditor,
or purchaser of any property attached in the suit, or bail,
or any person other than the parties to the record, shall be
bound by such adjudication, unless he shall have had due
notice of
the application for leave to amend, and opportu-
nity to be heard thereon, according to an order of notice to
that efrect, to be issued by the court when applied for by
the plaintiff.

some
justice
thereof,

upon 
which unnecessary
counts and
statements will be
stricken
out
of the record ; which
rules shall, as far
as possible, be
adapted to discourage
negligence and
deceit, to prevent

to
secure parties from
being misled,
to place the party
not in fault as nearly
as possible in the
same condition he
would have
been in if no
