"This Statute was passed to relieve the Courts from a contrariety of opinion as to
the right of appeal in Equity causes. 'l‘he Judiciary Acts of I792 and 1797. provided.
that the Superior Courts should "be competent to sustain a suit by bill and proceedings
therein, until the setting down of the oausc for hearing; such Superior Courtshall then
submit the merits of the suit, with the evidence thereon. which in all cases shall be
given viva rmce in Court (or otherwise within the rules of the Common Law,) and all
matters respecting the same to a special Jury, who shall give their verdict on the same;
but if either party shall be dissatisﬁed with such verdict, an appeal may be entered in
the Clerk's otliee within ten days after trial, when a hearing of such cause shall again
be had before another special Jury. and such trial shall be ﬁnal and conclusive." The
Act of 1797 repealed the Act of 1792, and the Act of 1799, repealed this section of the
Act of 1797, with others, and is itself silent on this subject. 'l‘he Constitution of 1798,
however, renders Jury trial, " as hentofore used,” inviolatc. The Convention of
Judges in Pool vs. Barnett, Dudley's Iflp. 8, held that these provisions of the Acts of
