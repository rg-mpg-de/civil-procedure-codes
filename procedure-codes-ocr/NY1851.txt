of the party, or  there be several parties united in interest,
and pleading together, by one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts,  such party be‘within the county
where the attorney resides, and capable of making the q.#Zdavit. The ahidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney,
if the action or defence be founded upon a written instrument
for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the
possession of the agent or attorney, or  all the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of
the agent or attorney. When the pleading is verified by any

the reasons why it is not made by the party. When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any oyicer
thereof ; and when the state or any qficer thereof in its be
half is a party, the verification may be made by any person

can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party, as
proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading.

§ 158. It shall not,be necessary for a party to setlfarth in

‘a pleading, the items of an account therein alleged ; but he

true, or be precluded from giving evidence‘ thereof. The
court, or a judge thereof, or a county judge, may order a

further account when the one delivered is defective, and the
court may in all cases order a bill of particulars of the claiu_

of either party to be furnished.

§ 159. In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view of substantial justice between
the parties,

§ 160. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted -in.

la pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person aggrieved thereby. And when the allegations of a.
pleading are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise,

nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the court
may require the pleading to be made deiinite and certain,
by amendment.

§ 161. In pleading a judgment, or other determination
of a court, or ofiicer of special jurisdiction,‘ it shall not be._

dent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts,E

and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading
shall be bound to establish an the trial, the facts showing such
performance. In an action or defence, founded upon an instrument, for the payment of money only, it shall be 
for a party to give a copy of the instrument, and to state
that there is due to him thereon from the adverse party a specgfied sum which he claims.

§ 163. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived;
therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute,
by its title and the day of its passage, and the court shall
thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

§ 164. In an action. for libel or slander, it shall not be
necessary to state in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for
the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff, of
the defamatory matter out of which .the cause of action
arose; but it shall be sufhcient to state generally, thatthe
same was. published or spoken concerning the plaintiff,
and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall
be boundto establish, on trial, that it was so published or
spoken.

§ 165. ln the actions mentioned in the last section, the
defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages; and whether
he prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence
the mitigating circumstances.

§ 166. In an action to recover the possession of property
distrained doing damage, an answer that the defendant or
person by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress was
made, and that the property distrained was at the time

1

doing damage thereon, shall be good, without setting forth
the title to such real property.

§ 167. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action
L in the same complaint where they all arise out of:

1. Contract, express or implied; or

2. Injuries with or without force, to the person; or

3. Injuries with or Without force, to property; or

4. Injuries to character; or

5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages, for withholding thereof, and the rents and proiits
of the same; or

6. Claims to recover personal.property, with or without
damages for the withholding thereof; or

7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a. contract, or
by operation of law.

But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to
one only of these classes, and must affect all the parties
to the action, and not require different places of trial, and
must be separately stated.

§ 168. Every material allegation of the complaint, not
:specifically controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section 149; and every material allegation of new matter
in the answer, not specifically controverted by the reply,
as prescribed in section 153, shall, for the purposes of the
action, be taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in a reply, shall not in any respect conclude the defendant, who may on the trial countervail it by proofs,
either in direct denial or by way of avoidance.
