holding an execution for t e sale of the same, at the time
and place appointed by said officer, either by notice given
in writing to said defendant in execution, or by advertisement, published in a newspaper printed in the county,

and place mentioned in the notice to him given, or to pay

the undertaking, given as aforesaid, shall be considered as
broken, and may be roceeded on as in other cases.

SEC. 490. The of‘cer who levies upon goods and chattels, by virtue of an execution issued by a court of record,

advertisement published in some newspaper printed in the
county, or in case no newspaper be printed therein, by putting up advertisements in five public places in the county ;

the sale is to be held. And where goods and chattels levied upon cannot be sold for want of bidders, the oilicer
making such return shall annex to the execution a true
and perfect inventory of such goods and chattels; and the
plaintiff in such execution may thereupon sue out another
writ of execution, directing the sale of the property levied
upon as aforesaid; but such goods and chattels shall not be
sold unless the time and place of sale be advertised as
hereiubefore provided.

SEC. 491. “Then any writ shall issue, directing the sale

that if the property remaining in his hands not sold shall,
in his opinion, be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, he
shall levy the same upon the lands and tenements, goods
and chattels, or either, as the law shall permit, being the
§r%perty of the judgment debtor, sutlicient to satisfy the
e t

SEC. 492. Whenever hereafter execution may be levied

execution are situated, and administer to them an oath impartially to appraise the property so levied upon, and such
ollicer, together with said freeholders, shall appraise said
property at its real value in money, and such appraisement
shall be signed by such officer and said freeholders respectively.

SEC. 493. The officer holding such appraisement shall f
forthwith deposit a cop thereof in the office of the clerk of 5
