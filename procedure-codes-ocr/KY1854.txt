PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS. 
§ l. This act shall be known as the Code of Practice in
Civil Cases of this state. 
§ 2. Remedies in civil cases m the courts of this state
are divided into two classe~- 
1. Actions.
2. Special proceedings, 
§ 3. A civil action is an ordinary proceeding in a court
of justice, by one party against another, for the enforcement 
or protection of a private right, or the redress or prevention
of a private wrong. It may also be brought for the recovery 
of a penalty or forfeiture. 
IN 
§ 4. Every other remedy in a civil case, is a special pro­
ceeding. 

§ 1. The forms of all actions and suits, heretofore existing,
are abolished; and hereafter there shall be but one form of
action for the enforcement or protection of private rights,
and the redress or prevention of private wrongs, which shall
be called a civil action. 
§ 2. In such action, the party complaining is known as
the plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant. 
§ 3. The proceedings in a civil action may be of two kinds-
1. Ordinary.
2. Equitable. 
§ 4. The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable
proceedings, in allcases where courts of chancery, before the 
adoption of this code, had jurisdiction; and must so pro­ 
ceed, in all cases where such jurisdiction was exclusive. · 
§ 5. In all other cases, the plaintiff must prosecute his 
action by ordinary proceedings. · 
§ 6. An action upon a written obligation which has been
lost or destroyed, may be prosecuted by ordinary proceed· 
ings. 
§ 7. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceed­
ings adopted, shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of
the action, but merely a change into the proper proceedings 
by an amendment in the pleadings, and a transfer of the '
action to the proper docket. 
§ 8. The error mentioned in the last section may be cor­
rected by the plaintiff, without motion.sat any time before 
the defendant has answered ; or afterwards, on motion in
court. 
§ 9. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correc­
tion made, in the following cases : 
1. Where the action has been commenced by equi­
table proceedings, the defendant, by motion made at 
the time of filing -his answer, may have them changed 
ea into ordinary proceedings, when it appears that, by the
provisions of section five, the plaintiff should have 
adopted ordinary proceedings, and in addition, that his
answer presents a defense on which be is entitled to a 
trial by jury.
2. Where the action has been commenced by ordi­ 
uary proceedings, the defendant, by motion made at or
before the time of filing his answer, may have them
changed into equitable proceedings, when it appears
that, by the provisions of section four, the plaintiff'
should have adopted equitable proceedings. 
§ 10. Where the action has been properly commenced by 
I , 
ordinary proceedings, either party shall have the right, by
motion, to have any issue, which, before the adoption of this
code, was exclusively cognizable in chancery, tried in the 
manner hereinafter prescribed in eases of equitable proceed­
ings ; and if all the issues are such as, before the adoption
of this Code, were cognizable in chancery, though none were 
exclusively so, the defendant shall be entitled to have them
all tried as in cases of equitable proceedings. 
§ 11. If the plaintiff's claim is for money due by contract,
and· the defendant puts in a defense of exclusively equitable
cognizance, upon the plaintiff filing an affidavit that he veri­ 
ly believes that he will succeed in the action, and that the
collection of his claim after judgment will be endangered by
the delay arising from 'such defense being put in, the court 
shall require the defendant to give security for the payment
of any judgment the plaintiff may obtain in the action, and 
upon his failure to give such security, shall order the defend­
ant to pay into court an amount sufficient to discharge the
plaintiff's claim and his probable costs ; upon which order
execution may be issued as upon a judgment, and the
amount collected upon execution shall be brought into court 
and await the decision of the action, and be paid to~~
plaintiff or defendant according to such decision. But no 
such security shall be required if the trial of the equita.~
-defense takes place during the term at which it is put in, 
nor until all defenses to the action, other than those of equi-
table cognizance, are tried or disposed of in favor of the 
plaintiff. 
§ 12. An error as to the kind of proceedings adopted in
the action, is waived by failure to move for its correction at 
the time and in the manner prescribed in this chapter ; and
all errors in the decisions of the court, on any of the motions 
named in this chapter, are waived, unless excepted to at the
time: which may be clone by the clerk noting, nt the end of 
such decision, words of the following import: "To which
decision, the plaintiff (or defendant) excepts." 
§ 13. The provisions of this Code, concerning the prose­
cution of a civil action, apply to both kinds of proceedings,
unless the contrary appears. 
§ 14. A judgment obtained in an action by ordinary pro­
ceedings shall not be annulled or modified by any order in
an action by equitable proceedings, except for a defense
which has arisen or been discovered since the judgment was 
rendered. But such judgment does not prevent the recov­
ery of any claim, though such claim might have been used
as a defense by way of set-off or counter-claim in the action
on which the judgment was recove~ed. 
 
§ 15. The court of appeals shall have appellate jurisdic­
tion over the final orders and judgments of all other courts
of this commonwealth, subject to the exceptions in the next section. 
§ 16. Where the action or proceeding is for the recovery
of money or personal property, and the matter in eontrover­
sy does not exceed one hundred dollars in value, or, in behalf
of the defendant, where the judgment of the inferior court
is against him for money or personal property, not exceeding 
in value one hundred dollars, unless reduced below that
amount by a set-off or counter-claim, or where the judg­
ment grants a divorce, or where the judgment or order is
by the quarterly court, county court, police court, city or
mayor's court, or justice's court, and an appeal is given to

value necessary to give jurisdiction to the court of appeals. 

§ 18. Circuit courts have original jurisdiction of all no­
tions and proceedings for the enforcement of civil rights or
redress of civil wrongs, except where exclusive jurisdiction
is given to other courts. 
§ 19. The Louisville chancery court has the same gener­
al jurisdiction of actions and proceedings commenced and
prosecuted by equitable proceedings as circuit courts, subject
to removals to and from the Jefferson circuit court, as pro­
vided-in sections 769 and 776.

ilar manner, with appeals to the court of appeals, except

court to the clerk of the circuit court, upon an appeal being
taken, instead of a copy of the complete record.

such papers.

deposit, or delivery thereof.

as the defendant, security for the costs being given.

sonal property taken under a distress warrant, where it is
brought by the tenant, or his assignee or undertenant, may be

ery, be taken from the officer who seized it, where he has no
other claim to hold it than that. derived from the warrant.

1. The style of the court in which the action is
brought. 
2. The style of the action, consisting of the names
of all the parties thereto, distinguishing them as plain­ 
tiff's and defendants, followed by the word "petition," if 
the proceedings are ordinary, and by the words, "peti­
tion in equity," if the proceedings are equitable. 
3. A statement in ordinary and concise language,
without repetition, of the facts constituting the plain­
tiff's cause of action. 
4. A demand of the relief to which the plaintiff
considers himself entitled. 
§ 119. Where the petition contains more than one cause
of action, each shall be distinctly stated in a separate para­ 
graph, and numbered- 

§ 120. The defendant may demur to the petition, where it
appears on its face either 
I. That the court has no jurisdiction of the person
of' the defendant, or the subject of the action; or 
2. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue ; 
3. That there is another action pending between the
same parties for the same cause ; or 
4. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or de­
fendant; or 
5. That the petition does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
§ 121. The demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds
of objection to the petition; unless it does so, it shall be 
regarded as objecting only that the petition does not state 
· facts sufficient 'to constitute a cause of action. 
§ 122. If the court sustains the demurrer, the plaintiff
may amend, with or without costs, as the court may order. 
§ 123. When any of the matters enumerated in section
120 do not appear upon the face of the petition, the objec­ 
tion may be taken by answer. If no such objection is taken
either by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed
to have waived the same, except only the objection to the
jurisdiction of the court over the subject of the action, and
the objection that the petition does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. 
§ 124. The defendant may demur to one or more of the
several causes of action alleged in the petition, and answer 
as to the residue. 

§ 125. The answer shall contain 
1. The style of the court and the style of the action, 
followed by the word "answer." But where there are 
several plaintiffs and defendants, it shall only be ne­
cessary to give the .one first named of each class with
the words "and others." 
2. A denial of each allegation of the petition 001r. 
troverted by the defendant, or of any knowledge or 
information thereof sufficient to form a belief.
3. A statement of any new matter constituting a 
defense, counter-claim, or set-off, in ordinary and con­
cise language, without repetition. · 
4. The defendant may set forth in his answer as
many grounds of defense, counter-claim, and set-off 
whether legal or equitable, as he shall have. Each 
shall be distinctly stated in a separate paragraph, an~l ·,
numbered. The several defenses must refer to the
causes of action which they are intended to nnswer,
in a manner by which they may be intelligibly.distin- 
guished. · _ . '; 
§ 126. The counter-claim mentioned in this chapter nuist
be a cause of action in favor of the defendants, or some of 
them, against the plaintiffs, or some of them, arising out of
the contract or transactions set. forth in the petition, as the
foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the 
subject of the action. 
§ 127. When it appears that a new party is necessary to
a final decision upon the oounter-claim, the court may either
permit the new party to be made, by a summons, to reply to 
the counter-claim in the answer, or may direct that it be
stricken out of the answer, and made the subject of a sepa­ 
rate action. 
§ 128. A set-off can only be pleaded in an action founded
on contract, and must be a cause of action arising upon con­ 
tract, or ascertained by the decision of a court. 
§ 129. Where it appears that a new party is necessary to
a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit the 
new party to be made, if it also appears that, owing to the 
insolvency or non-residence of the plaintiff, or other cause,
the defendant will be in danger of losing his claim unless
permitted to use it as a set-oft: 
§ 130. Where the facts stated in answer are not sufficient
to constitute a defense, counter-claim, or set-oft; the plaintiff
may demur. 
§ 131. It shall be the duty of the guardian of an in­
fant, or committee of a person of unsound mind, or attor­ 
ney appointed for a prisoner, to file an answer denying the
material ullegat. ions _of ~e, rtition prejudicial to such de- 
fendant. 

§ 132. There shall be no reply, except upon the allegation
of a counter-claim or set-off in the answer. 
§ 133. When the answer contains new matter constituting 
a counter-claim or set-off, the plaintiff may reply to such
new matter, denying each allegation controverted by him, or 
any knowledge or information thereof sufficient to form a
belief, and · may allege in concise language any new matter
not inconsistent with the petition, constituting a defense to 
the counter-claim or set-oft: 
§ 134. Where the facts stated in the reply do nut amount
to a sufficient defense, the defendant may demur. 

§ 135. The defense to an action prosecuted by ordinary
proceedings, must be filed on the day of the term on which 
the case is set for trial-
1. Where the summons has been served ten days 
before the commencement of the term, in the county in
which the action is brought, or in an adjoining county;

county; 
2. Where it has been served thirty days, elsewhere
in the state, or sixty days out of the state; or 
3. Where the defendant has been constructively
summoned thirty days. 
§ 138. Where the service of the summons was before the

mentioned in the last section, the defense shall be filed in
thirty days after the service. 
§ 139. If the answer, in equitable proceedings, contains
a counter-claim or set-oft; the plaintiff shall reply within 
. twenty days after the answer is filed, or ninety days before the ensuing term, 
§ 140. The court may, for good cause shown, extend the 
time for filing an answer or reply, to some subsequent day in
that or the next succeeding term; the party applying for the 
delay paying the costs occasioned thereby. 
§ 141. The filing of an answer or reply in the clerk's ot:.
flee in vacation, within the time allowed, with notice thereof' 
to the opposite party, or his attorney, shall be equivalent to 
a filing in court. 

§ 142. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party,
or his attorney, and the petition, answer, and reply must
each be verified by the affidavit of the party, to the effect
that he believes the statements thereof to be true; such 
verification shall not make other 01· greater proof necessary
on the side of the adverse party. The verification of any
pleading of a corporation may be by any officer or agent on
whom the summons in an action against the corporation may
be served, or by its attorney in the action. 
§ 143. The verification by affidavit mentioned in the last section, shall not be required to the answer of a guardian or
committ.ee defending for an infant, or person of unsound 
mind 01· imprisoned; nor in any case where the admission of
the truth of the allegations of the petition or answer might
subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecution; nor to
pleadings affecting injuries to person or character; nor to 
petitions in actions founded on a note, bond, bill of exchange, 
mortgage, or other written obligation of the defendant; nor
to defenses founded on the written obligation, release, or
written acknowledgment of the plaintiff, unless the writing 
on which the action or defense is founded is lost, mutilated,
or destroyed. 
§ 144. Neitaer presumptions of law, nor matters of which
judicial notice is taken, need be stated in a pleading. 
§ 145. If the action, counter-claim, or set-off, is founded
on a note, bond, bill, or other writing, as evidence of iudebt­
~dness, it must be filed as a part of the pleading, if in the
power of the party to produce it. If not filed, the reason 
thereof must be stated in the pleading. If upon an account,
a copy thereof must, in like manner, be filed with the plead­
mg. 
§ 146. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the
parties. 
§ 147. If irrelevant or redundant matter is inserted in a
pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person
aggrieved thereby, at the cost of the party whose pleading
contained it. 
§ 148. In pleading a judgment, or other determination,
of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, hut such 
judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly
given or ma<l~. If such allegation is made in a petition, and 
is not controverted in the answer, or made in the answer in 
relation to a counter-claim or set-off, and is not controverted
in the reply, it need not be proved on the trial. 
§ 149. In pleading the performance of a condition prece­
dent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts 
showing such performance, but it may be stated, generally,
that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part ;
and if such allegation is not controverted as-stated in the 
last section in regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary 
to prove it on trial. 
§ 150. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be
necessary to state in the petition any extrinsic facts, for the
purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the
defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose;
but it shall be sufficient to state, generally, that the same 
was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such
allegation is not controverted as stated in section 148 in
regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary to prove it on 
the trial. 
§ 151. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the 
defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circum­ 
stances legally admissible in evidence, to reduce the amount
of damages; and whether he proves the justification or not,
he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances. 
§ 152. In an action for the recovery of real property, it
must be described in the petition with such convenient cer­
tainty, as to enable an officer holding an execution to identi­ 
fy it. 
§ 153. Every material allegation of the petition not spe­
cifically controverted by the answer, and every material alle­
gation of new matter in the answer, constituting a counter­
claim or set-off, not specifically controverted by the reply,
must, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But.
the allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating to 
a counter-claim or set-off, or of new matter in a reply, is to 
be deemed controverted by the adverse party as upon a
direct denial or avoidance, us the case may require. Allega­
tions of value, or of amount of damage, shall not be con­
sidered as true, by the failure to controvert them. 
§ 154. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essen­
tial to the claim or defense, and which could not be stricken 
from the pleading without leaving it insufficient. 
§ 155. If either party shall rely upon any deed, or other
writing, he shall file with his pleading the original deed or
writing, if in his power. If he cannot produce such deed
or writing, he shall so state in his pleading, together with
the reasons therefor; and if such reasons are sufficient, he
may file the best evidence of the contents of such deed or 
writing in his power. Original deeds, and other writings,
filed by either party as above provided, shall remain on file
for the inspection of the other party, until allowed by the 
court to be withdrawn ; and in such case, copies, attested by
the clerk, shall be substituted by the party withdrawing the 
originals. 

§ 156. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it has actually
misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his
action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged
that n. party has been so misled, that fact must be shown to 
the satisfaction of the court, and it must also be shown in
what respect he bas been misled; and, thereupon, the court
may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as
may be just. 
§ 157. Where the variance is not material as provided in
the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found 
according to the evidence, and may order an immediate
amendment without costs. 
§ 158. Where, however, the allegation of the claim or
defense to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in
some particular or particulars only, but in its general scope
and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance within
the last two sections, but a failure of proof. 
§ 159. The plaintiff may amend his petition without leave, 
at any time before an answer is filed, and without prejudice
to the proceedings already had. 
§ 160. Upon a demurrer being overruled, the party de­
murring may answer or reply. 
§ 161. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of jus­
tice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any plead­
ing or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of
any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a par­
ty, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other
allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment 
does not change substantially the claim or defense, by con­ 
forming the pleading or p~ceeding ~ the facts proved. 

The oourt may likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer or 
reply to be made, after the time limited by this Code, or, by 
an order, enlarge such time. And whenever any proceeed­ 
ing taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to the
provisions of this Code, the court may permit an amendment
of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto.
And when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or
uncertain that the precise nature of the claim or defense is 
not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made
definite and certain by amendment, The court must, in 
every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the
proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of
the adverse party"; and no Judgment shall be reversed or af­ 
fected by reason of such error or defect. ·
§ 162. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may 
be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint,
answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occur­ 
ring after the filing of the former petition, answer, or reply.
§ 163. ·when either party shall amend any pleading or 
proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit or
otherwise, that the adverse party could not be ready for
trial in consequence thereof a continuance may be grant­ 
ed to some day in the same term, or to another term of the
court. 
§ 164. Where petitions are filed without verification, as
required by section 142, the action shall not, on that account,
be dismissed, if the verification be made on or before the
calling of the action for trial.  
§ 165. No objection shall be taken, after judgment, to 
any pleading for the want of, or defect. in the verification. 
§ 166. Courts may permit the amendments authorized by 
this chapter to be made without being verified, as prescribed
in section 142, unless a new and distinct cause of action or
defense is thereby introduced. 

§ 167. In actions by equitable proceedings, either party 
may annex to bis petition, answer, or reply, written inter­
rogatories to any one or more of the adverse parties, con­ 
cerning any of the material matters in issue in the action. 
The answers to which, on oath, may be read by either party,
as a deposition between the party interrogating and the par­ 
ty answering.
§ 168. The party answering shall not. be confined to re­ 
sponding merely to the interrogatories, but may state any
new matter concerning the same cause of action, which shall 
likewise be read as a deposition. 
§ 169. Where the interrogatories are annexed to the pe­
tition, they shall be answered at the same time the party is
required to answer the petition; where annexed to the an­ 
swer or reply, then in twenty days after notice shall be given 
thereof to the adverse party or'\ie attorney; but if answer .. 
d tw6\nty daye before ths term Rt which the notion atand& 
regularly for trial, the action shall not be postponed on ac­
count of their not being sooner answered. 
§ 170. In actions by ordinary proceedings, either party
may, in like manner, annex written interrogatories to any
one or more of the adverse parties to his petition, answer, or 
reply, concerning any material matter in issue in the action,
in the following cases : 
1. Where the party interrogated does not reside in
the same or an adjoining county. 
2. Where the party interrogated is unable to attend
court on account of age, infirmity, or imprisonment, or 
is a female. · 
§ 171. Where the interrogatories, in au action by ordinary
proceedings, are annexed to the petition, they shall be an­
swered at the same time the petition is required to be an­ 
swered; where annexed to the answer or reply, at or before
the calling of the cause for trial, where the party interroga­
ted had reasonable notice of their being filed. 
§ 172. The trial of an action by ordinary proceedings,
shall not be postponed on account of the failure to answer
the interrogatories, if the party interrogated is present in
court at the trial, so that he may be orally examined; nor: 
in case of his absence, without an affidavit showing the facts
the party believes will be proved by the answers thereto, and
that the party has not filed the interrogatories, nor omitted 
to file them, for the purpose of delay. Whereupon, if the
party will consent that the facts stated in the affidavit shall

merely. An unqualified statement of a fact, shall be con­
sidered as made of his personal knowledge. 
§ 175. The answers to the interrogatories shall be verified
by the affidavit of the party answering, to the effect that the
statements in them made of his own personal knowledge are 
true, and those made from the information of others, he be­
lieves to be true. 
§ 176. When the party resides in the same or an adjoin­
ing county, he may be summoned by the adverse party, and
compelled to testify on the trial of' an action by ordinary
proceedings, as any other witness. 
§ 177. Where a party filing interrogatories shall also file 
an affidavit that he verily believes the subject of the inter­
rogatories, or any of them, is in the personal knowledge of
the opposite party, and that his answers thereto, if truly 
made from such knowledge, will sustain the claim or defense,
or any part thereof, and the opposite party shall fail, after 
reasonable time allowed therefor, to answer them, the claim
or defense, or the part thereof according to such affidavit,
shall be deemed to be sustained, and judgment given ac­
cordingly. 
§ 178. The court may compel answers to interrogatories 
by process of contempt, and may, on the failure of the par­ 
ty to answer them, after reasonable time allowed therefor,
dismiss the petition or quash the answer of the party so 
failing.

ted; or that the defendant has money, or securities for
money, or evidences of debt, in the possession of him­
self or of others for his use, and is about to depart from
this state, without leaving property therein sufficient to 
satisfy the plaintiff's claim. 
§ 181. The order of arrest shall uot be issued by the
clerk, until there has been executed in his office by one or
more sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, a· bond to the effect

is wrongfully obtained, not exceeding double the amount of· 
the plaintiff's claim stated in the affidavit. 
§ 182. The order of arrest shall be addressed and deliver­
ed, with a copy thereof, to the sheriff. It shall state the
names of the parties to the action, the court in which the 
action is brought, and the amount of the plaintiff's claim
specified in the affidavit, and shall require the sheriff to
arrest the defendant and hold him to bail in the sum of the 
pl~ntiff 's claim, with the probable costs of the action, not
e:tceeding twenty-five dollars, and to make return of the
order on a day to be named therein, with the bail bond, if

done by causing one or more sufficient bail to execute a
bond to the plaintiff in the presence of the sheriff, or of
the jailer where the defendant has been committed to jail,
to the effect that, if judgment shall be rendered in the ac­ 
tion against the defendant, he will render himself amenable 
to the process of the court thereupon. The bond, when
accepted, shall be returned to the clerk's office, and the
defendant discharged, 
§ 191. The bail must be a resident of this state, and be

§ 194. The bail adjudged insufficient, shall not be there­

rest the defendant; and, thereupon, the same proceedings 
may be had, and with the like effect, as nre directed upon an
order of arrest, 
§ 195. Upon judgments in aotions in which the defendant
has been arrested and held to bail, and in which the order of
arrest has not been vacated, an execution against the body
of the defendant may be issued, upon which the same pro­
ceedings shall be had, and the defendant shall 1~ dealt with
in the same manner, as provided by law in the civil actions
in which executions may be issued against the body of the
defendant; except that the oath of insolvency, upon rea­
sonable notice, may be taken at any time after the arrest, by 
delivering to the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, a schedule
of the property intended to be surrendered, although said
schedule may not have been deli vered ten days hefore the

livered to the jailer. 
§ 197. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the 
bail may, at any time or place, arrest him, or authorize, in 
writing indorsed upon a copy of the order of arrest and bail

necessary to fix the liability of the bail, which shall be, to
pay the amount of the judgment and costs. 
§ 199. The bail can be proceeded against in a separate
action only. 
§ 200. He will be exonerated by the death of the defend­
ant, or his removal from this state under process of law as
a fugitive, before the return day of the summons served
upon the bail in the action to enforce his liability, or by the 
imprisonment of the defendant in the penitentiary, or his
legal discharge from the obligation to render himself amena­
ble to the process of the court, or by his surrender to the
sheriff of the county in which he was arrested in execution . 
thereof hy the return day of the summons in the action
against the bail, or within such farther time as the court, in
which the action is pending, may allow. If the defendant 
is confined in any jail of this state, the bail will be exoner­
ated by delivering to the jailer thereof, at any time before
the return day of the summons in the action against the bail,
a certified copy of the order of an-est and of the bail bond,
with a written order thereupon to detain the defendant in 
custody until discharged by law from the action in which the
bond was given. The jailer shall give a written acknowl­
edgment of the receipt of the order, which shall be filed 
with the original bond. 
§ 201. If, after being arrested, tho defendant escapes or
is rescued, or bail is not taken or is adjudged insufficient, 
01· a deposit is not made, the sheriff' shall he liable us bail,
unless he had committed the defendant to jail and obtained
a written acknowledgment thereof from the jailer; in which
case, the jailer shall be so liable. Either officer may dis­
charge himself from such liability, by putting in sufficient
bail at any time before judgment, 
§ 202. The liability of the officer as bail, shall be fixed
in the manner provided in section 198, and can be enforc­ 
ed only in a separate action against, him, or against him
and his sureties in his official bond, as in other cases of de­
linquency. 
§ 203. The bail adjudged insufficient, shall be liable to 
the officer for the damages he may sustain by reason of such 
i nsuffioiency. 

§ 204. A defendant against whom an order of arrest has
been obtained, may, at any time before judgment in the ac­
tion, and before a decision of a motion on account of the in- 
sufficiency of the bail, apply to the court, or, in vacation and
before executing a bail bond, to the judge thereof, or to any 
circuit judge, or to the presiding judge of the county court,
by motion, to vacate the order of arrest, or to reduce the
amount of bail. Reasonable notice of the motion shall be
given to the plaintiff. If satisfied that the bail ought not
to have been required, or that the sum for which it was de­
manded is too large, the court or judge may vacate the order
of arrest, or reduce the amount of bail. The decision of the 
motion shall be final in the action, but shall not affect the
rights of the parties in any other action. Upon the vaca­ 
tion of tho order of arrest, the defendant shall be discharged,
or the bail bond, if any is given, shall be cancelled. 
§ 205. If the motion is supported by affidavits or other
evidence out of the record, tho plaintiff may oppose it by
affidavits or other evidence, in addition to that on which tho
order of arrest was obtained. 
§ 206. The writ of sci ref 'acia« against bail is abolished.

of specific personal property, may, at the commencement of 
the action, or at any time before judgment, claim the imme­
diate delivery of the property, as herein provided.

ant believes the plaintiff ought to recover for the deten­
tion thereof.

be adjudged, and by paying such sums of money as may be
adjudged against him in the action, not exceeding double the

sion it was found. If such bond is not executed within the

the plaintiff. He shall return the bonds with the order. 
§ 216. Before taking any bond, the sheriff shall, upon
the suggestion of either party that the value of the proper­
ty is not truly stated in the order for its delivery, and, 
where the suggestion is on the part of the defendant, on his

they shall be satisfied out of it ratably. 
§ 232. The sheriff shall not, in executing an order of

§ 233. An order of attachment binds the defendant's
property in the county which might be seized under an ex­
ecution against him, from the time of the delivery of the or­
der to the sheriff, in the same manner as an execu tion would

position made of it. Where garnishees are summoned, their
names and the time each was summoned must be stated. 
And, where real property is attached, the sheriff shall de­
scribe it with sufficient certainty to identify it, and, where
he can do so, by a reference to the deed or title under which
the defendant holds it. He shall return, with the order, all 
bonds taken under it. 

§ 239. The court shall make proper orders for the preser- 
vation and use of the property during the pendency of the
action, and for paying into court or securing the debts and
funds attached. It may direct a sale of the property, other 
than slaves, where, by reason of its perishable nature, or of7'.«~
the cost of keeping it, a sale would be for the benefit of the
parties. In vacation, suMle may be ordered by the judge 
of the court, or, of any·~ property other than a steam- 
boat, by the presiding judge of the county court. The sale 
shall be public, after advertisement, and made in such man·
ner and upon such terms of credit, with security, as the 
court or judge, having regard to the probable duration of
the action, may direct. The proceeds, if collected by the
sheriff, together with all the moneys received by him from
garnishees, shall be held and paid over by him under the
same requirement and responsibilities of himself and his
sureties, as are provided in respect to money deposited in lieu 
of bail.

erty shall be forthcoming, as the court may direct. Perform­ 
ance of these bonds may be summarily enforced by orders
and proceedings as in cases of contempt.

ing may be had as in other actions, and judgment be ren­
dered in favor of the plaintiff to subject the property of the

property, or before the payment to the plaintiff of the pro­
eeeds thereof, or of any attached debt, present his petition,  
verified by oath, to the court, disputing the validity of the
attachment, or stating I\ claim to the property or to an in- 
terest in or lien on it under any other attachment, or other­ 
wise, and setting forth the facts upon which such claim is 
founded, and his claim shall be investigated. A non-resi­
dent petitioner shall, in all such cases, give security for costs.

commissioner, or may impannel a jury to inquire into the
facts. If it is found that the petitioner has title to, a lien on,

cretion of the court.

der it, unless in a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court,

vessel and her engine and furniture by the court in which 
the action is brought, or by the judge thereof or any circuit
Judge, or by the presiding judge of the county court.

attachment was granted, to the effect that the obligors will
pay to the plaintiff such sums of money as may be adjudged
to him in the action, or that the boat or vessel shall be forth­ 
coming, and subject to the order of the court, for the satis- 
faction of such judgment as may be rendered therein­

davits or the proofs in the cause, that the plaintiff' has a just
claim, and that the property is about to be sold, concealed,
or removed from the state, or where the plaintiff states on
oath that he has reasonable cause to believe and does believe
that, unless prevented by the court, the property will M 
sold, concealed, or removed from the state, an attachment
may be granted against the property. . 
§ 274. In an action by a vendor of property fraudulently
purchased, to vacate the contract and have a restoration of
the property or compensation · therefor, where the petition
shows such fraudulent purchase of property and the amount
of the plaintiff's claim, and is verified by his oath, an attach­
ment against the property may be granted. 
§ 275. The attachments in the cases mentioned in the last
two sections, may be granted by the court in which the ac­ 
tion is brought, or by the judge thereof or auy circuit judge,

proceedings in cases of attachments against specific prop­
erty. 

§ 285. An attachment obtained at the oommenoement of
the action shall be sustained or discharged at the time that 
judgment is rendered in the action, unless for sufficient cause

ment obtained after the commencement of the action, shall
not be sustained until the defendant has had the time for
controverting it provided in this chapter. 
§ 286. If judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant
the attachment shall be discharged. 
§ 287. If judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff,

ner, on the rendition of judgment in the action, be subject 
to appeal. · 
§ 293. The reinstatement of attachments, as provided in 
this article, shall only be binding on the inferior court until

commenced before this Code takes effect, are not affected by 
its provisions, but are to be granted, to proceed in all re­
spects, and be determined as if it had not been adopted. 
§ 298. The injunction provided by this Code, is a com­
mand to refrain from a particular act. It may be the final 
judgment in an action, or may be allowed ae a proviaional
remedy; and where so allowed, it shall be by order. The 
writ of injunction is abolished. 
§ 299. Where it appears by the petition that the plaintiff
is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any
part thereof, eonsists in restraining the commission or con­
tinuance of some act which would produce great or irrepar­
able injury to the plaintiff, or where, during the Jitigation, it
appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens or is about 
to do, or is procuring or suffering to be <lone, some act, in
violation of the plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of 
the action and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a
temporary injunction may be granted to restrain such act, 
It may also be granted in any case where it is specially au­
thorized bystatute. 
§ 300. The injunction may be granted at the commence­
ment of the action, or at any time before judgment, by the
court, or by the judge thereof or any circuit judge, or by
the presiding judge of the county court, where it appears by
the petition that the plaintiff is entitled thereto. And,
during a litigation, it may be granted by the court, or by
the judge thereof or any circuit judge, where it satisfactori­
ly appears by affidavits that sufficient grounds exist therefor. 
§ 301. The judge of the circuit court for any county 
may, if he deem it right and proper, by an order duly enter­ 
ed on the order book of said court, authorize the clerk of
said court to grant injunctions and restraining orders, in the
same manner and under like restrictions that the presiding 
judges of county courts may grant injunctions and restrain­
ing orders; but no such authority shall be conferred on any
deputy of such clerk.

therefor, to the party enjoined. 
§ 306. On the hearing of au application for an injunction
of which notice has been given, each party may read affida- 
vits.

junction shall specify in the order therefor an amount, for 
which the party obtaining it shall give security in a bond to
the party enjoined, before the injunction shall become effect-
ual; which amount shall be sufficient to cover all the prob-
able damages and costs that· may be occasioned by the in- 
junction. The court or judge may prescribe the effect of
the bond, so as to secure to the party enjoined the damages
to which he may become entitled, if it is finally decided that
the injunction ought not to have been granted. Where the
injunction is to stay proceedings upon a judgment or final
order for money, the amount for which security is required
shall be sufficient to cover, with other damages, the sum en-
joined, with five years interest thereon. Where the injunc- 
tion is to stay proceedings upon a judgment for property, 
the amount specifled in the order shall be sufficient to eover 
also the rent, hire, or value of the use thereof for two years ;
and in case of personal property, its value likewise. 
§ 308. The order of injunction shall not be issued by the
clerk, until the bond mentioned in the last section has been
executed in his office by one or more sufficient sureties of
the party obtaining the injunction. Where the injunction
is to stay proceedings upon a judgment or final order, the
bond shall be to the effect that the party obtaining the in­ 
junction will satisfy the judgment or order, or so much of it
as is enjoined, to the extent to which the injunction may be
dissolved; and that he will also satisfy any modified judg­
ment or order that may be rendered or made in lieu of it,
or so much of it as exceeds the amount left unenjoined. In
other cases, unless otherwise directed by the court or judge,
the bond shall be to the effect that the party giving it will 
pay to the party enjoined such damages as he may sustain,
if it is finally decided that the injunction out not to have 
been granted.

clerk, under the same responsibilitiea as in other cases of
sureties taken by him.

order.

party applying therefor makes affidavit that no injunction
has been previously granted to stay the proceedings on such
judgment or order.

motion therefor has been overruled by the court. Nor shall
any be granted by a judge of a county court, where it has 
been refused by the judge of the court in which the action
is brought, or by any circuit judge. A judge refusing an
application for an injunction, shall, if requested by the de·
fendant, give him a certificate thereof 
§ 316. Disobedience of an injunction may be punished by
the court, or by the judge thereof, or any circuit judge in 
vacation, as a contempt. An attachment may be issued by 
the court or judge, upon the production of evidence by affi­ 
davit of the breach of the injunction, against the party com·
mitting the same. And unless be purges the contempt, if in
vacation, the judge may commit him to jail until the sitting 
of the court, or take a bond with security for his appearance 
to answer for the contempt at the next term of the court, 
and, in the meantime, to obey the injunction .. 
§ 317. The affidavits read upon an applioation for an in·
junction shall be filed with the papers of the case. 
§ 318. A party enjoined may, at any time before judg­
ment, upon reasonable notice to the party who has obtained
the injunction, move the court for additional security on be­
half of such party: and, if it appears on such motion that
the surety in the injunction bond has removed from this
state, or is insufficient, the court may vacate the order of in­ 
junction, unless in a reasonable time sufficient security is
given. 

§ 319. The party enjoined may, at any time, upon rea­
sonable notice to the plaintiff, move the court, upon the
plaintiff's petition and affidavits alone, to dissolve or mod­
ify an injunction of the application for which no notice was
given. 
§ 320. A motion to dissolve or modify an injunction grant­
ed by a county judge, may, at any time, upon reasonable no- 
tree to the plaintiff, be made before the judge of the court 
or any circuit judge, upon the plaintiff's petition and affida­
vits alone. The order of the judge overruling the same, or 
dissolving or modifying the injunction, with the notice, shall 
be returned to the office of the clerk of the court. They 
shall be noted upon the record and the order obeyed, as if 
made by the court. 
§ 321. After answer filed by the party enjoined, he may
give notice to the plaintiff of a motion to be made to the
court in not less than ten days thereafter upon the whole
case, to dissolve or modify the injunction, Upon such mo­
tion, each party may read depositions and other competent
evidence in writing.' The court shall not be bound to take
the answer as true. 
§ 322. The motion upon the whole case to dissolve or
modify the injunction, may be postponed on the application
of either party, to a subsequent day, or to t~ next term,
where the court is satisfied that, under the circumstances of
the case, the delay is proper. When delay is asked in order 
to obtain the testimony of a witness, it must appear by affi­
davit what facts the witness is expected to prove, that the
affiant believes his testimony will be true, and that it could
not have been obtained by due diligence. 
§ 323. After hearing the motion, the court or judge shall
overrule the same, or dissolve or modify the injunction ac­ 
cording to the right of the case. 
§ 324. Only one motion to dissolve or modify an injunc­
tion upon the whole case, shall ho allowed. 
§ 325. Upon the dissolution in whole or in part of an in­
junction to stay proceedings upon a judgment or final order, 
the damages shall be assessed by the court, which may hear
the evidence and decide in a summary way, or may, at its
discretion, cause a jury to be impanneled to find the dam­
ages. Where money is enjoined, the damages may be any
rate per cent. on the amount released by the disselution, 
which, in the discretion of the court, may be proper, not ex­
ceeding ten per cent. And, where the delivery of property 
has been delayed by the injunction, the value of the use, hire, 
or rent thereof shall be assessed. Judgment shall be render­
ed, against the party who obtained the injunction, for the 
damages assessed; and the assessment shall be conclusive
against the surety of such party. 
§ 326. Where the plaintiff desires to apply for a rein­
statement of an injunction dissolved or modified on motion,
the court or judge · shall make the order of dissolution or
modification to take effect in a reasonable time thereafter,
not exceeding twenty days, and shall express in the order
that the plaintiff has leave to apply in the meantime for a
reinstatement of the injunction. 
§ 327. A judge of the court of appeals, in any case in
which the plaintiff has secured the right to apply therefor as 
provided in the last section, may, upon an inspection of
copies of the record, and of the depositions and evidence
read upon the motion to dissolve or modify the injunction,
reinstate the same in whole or in part. And, if the order of
reinstatement is filed in the clerk's office in the time limited
as provided in the last section, the injunction, as reinstated,
shall be obeyed; otherwise, the order of dissolution or modi­
fication shall take effect. 

§ 328. In an action by u vendor to vacate a fraudulent
purchase of property, or by a creditor to subject any prop­
erty or fund to his claim, or between partners or others 
jointly owing or interested in any property or fund, on the
application of the plaintiff or of any party whose right to 
or interest in the property or fund, or the proceeds thereof
is probable, and where it is shown that the property or fund 
is m danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured,
the court may appoint n receiver to take charge thereof
during the pendenoy of the action, and may order and coerce
the delivery of it to him. 
§ 329. In nn action by a mortgagee for the foreclosure of 
his mortgage, and sale of the mortgaged property, a receiver
may, in like manner,. be appointed, where it appears that the
mortgaged property is in danger of being lost, removed, or
materially injured, or that the condition of the mortgage
has not been performed, and that the property is probably
insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt. 
§ 330. No party, or attorney, or person interested in an 
action, shall be appointed receiver therein 
§ 331. Before entering upon bis duties, the receiver must
be sworn to perform them faithfully, and, with one or more
sureties approved by the court, execute a bond to such per­
son and in such sum as the court shall direct, to the effect 
that he will faithfully discharge the duties of receiver in the
action, a· d obey the orders of the court therein. 
§ 332. The receiver has, under the control of the court,
power to bring and def end actions, to take and keep posses­
sion of the property, to receive rents, collect debts, and 
generally, to do such acts respecting the property as the 
court may authorize. 

§ 333. Where it is admitted, by the pleading or examiua­
tion of a party, that he has in his possession, or under his 
control, any money, or other thing capable of delivery, which,
being the subject of the litigation, is held by him, as trustee
for another party, or which belongs or is due to another par­ 
ty, the court may order the same to be deposited in court, or
delivered to such party with or without security, subject to 
the further direction of the court. 
§ 334. Wherever in the exercise of its authority, a court
has ordered the deposit or delivery of money or other thing,
and the order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the 
disobedience, may make an order requiring the sheriff to
take the money or thing, and deposit or deliver it in con­
formity with its direction. 
§ 335. The court may direct the sheriff to keep safely
any property delivered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and may allow him the necessary expenses attend­ 
ing the same, to be paid by such party as the court shall
direct, and taxed in the costs of the action. 
§ 336. It may confide to the sheriff money deposited or
paid into court, which shall be kept by him under the same 
requirements and responsibilities of himself and his sureties
as are provided by this Code in respect to money deposited
in lieu of bail. 
§ 337. A court sitting in a county in which, or in any
county adjoining which, there is a bank, or a branch of a 
bank, created by the laws of this state: transacting regular
banking business, may order money paid into court to be 
deposited in such bank or branch to the credit of the court, 
in the action or proceeding in which the money was paid. 
Money so deposited, shall be paid only upon the check of 
the clerk of the court, annexed to its certified order for the 
payment, and in favor of the person. to whom the order
directs the payment to be made. 
§ 338. Money deposited or paid into court in any action,
shall not be loaned out by the court, unless with the consent
of all the parties having an interest in or making claim to
the same. 

§ 339. Issues arise on the pleadings, where a fact, or con·
clusion of law, is maintained by one party and controverted 
by the. other. They are of two kinds: 
1. Of law.
2. Of fact. 
§ 340. An issue of fact arises
1. Upon a materialallegation in the petition, denied 
by the answer.
2. Upon a set-off or counter-claim presented in the 
answer, and denied by the reply. 
3. Upon material new matter in the answer or reply, 
which shall be considered as controverted by the oppo­
site party without further pleading. 

§ 341. A trial is a judicial examination of the issues,
whether of law or of fact, in an action. 
§ 342. Issues of law must be tried by the court. Issues 
of fact, arising in action by ordinary proceedings for the re­
covery of money, or of specific real or personal property, 
shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived. 
§ 343. All other issues of fact, whether arising in ordi-.
nary or equitable proceedings, shall be tried by the court,
subject to its power to order any issue or issues to be tried
by a jury. 
§ 344. The trial in each action shall be in the order in
which itstands upon the docket. 
§ 345. A motion to postpone a trial on account of the
absence of evidence, can be made only upon affidavit 
showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be ob­
tained, and that due diligence has been used to obtain it; 
and, if it is for an absent witness, the affidavit must show 
. what facts the affiant believes the witness will prove, and 
not merely the effect of such facts in evidenoe, and that
the affiant himself believes them to be true. If, thereupon,
the adverse party will consent that, on the trial, they shall 
be taken as true, the trial shall not be postponed for that 
oause. 

§ 346. The general mode of summoniug, impanneling,
challenging, and swearing the jury, is not changed by this 
Code. 
§ 347. When the jury has been sworn, the trial shall pro· 
oeed in the following order, unless the 'court for speoial rea­
sons otherwise directs: 
1. The plaintiff must brietly state his claim, and the
evidence by which he expects to sustain it. 
2. The defendant . 'must then briefly state his de­
fense, and the evidence" be expects to offer in support 
of it.
3. 'Ihe party on whom rests the burtheu of. proof in 
the whole action, must first produce his evidence; the
adverse party will then produce his evidence. 
4. The parties will then be confined to rebutting evi­
dence, unless the court, for good reasons in furtherance
of justice, permits them to offer evidence in their origi­
nal case. 
3. Wheu the evidence ii; concluded, either party
may request instructions to the jury on points of law, 
which shall be given or refused by the court; which
instructions shall be reduced to writing if either party
require it. 
6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to
the jury. In the argument, the party having the bur­
then of proof shall have the conclusion, and the adverse
party the opening. If there is more than one speech
on either side, or if several defendants having separate
defenses, appear by different counsel, the court shall
arrange their relative order. 
§ 348. Whenever in the opinion of the court, it is proper
for the jury to have a view of real property which is the sub­ 
ject of litigation, or of the place in which any material fact
occurred, it may order them to be conduotcd in a body un­ 
der the charge of an officer to the place, which shall be shown
to them by some person appointed by the court for that pur­
pose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than
the person so appointed, shall speak to them on any su hject
connected with the trial. 
§ 349. When the case is finally submitted to the jury,
they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If they 
retire, they must be kept together in some convenient place,
~nder the charge of an-officer, until they agree upon a ver­
dict or are discharged by the court, subject to the discretion
of the court to permit them ·to separate temporarily at 'night, 
and at their meals. The officer. having them under his 
charge, shall not suffer any communication to be made to
them, or make any himself, except to ask them if they- have
agreed upon their verdict, unless by order of the court; and 
he shall not, before their verdict is rendered, communicate to 
any person the state of their deliberations, or the verdict
agreed upon. 
§ 350. If the jury are permitted to separate either during
the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they may be· 
admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse
with, or suffer themselves to be addressed by, any other per­
son, on any subject of the trial; and, during the trial, that
it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon, 
until the cause is finally submitted to them. 
§ 351. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if
there is a disagreement between them as to any part of the 
testimony, or if they desire to be informed as to any point of
law arising in the case, they may request the officer to con­
duct them into court, where the information required shall 
be given in the presence of or after notice to the parties or
their counsel. 
§ 352. The jury may be discharged by the court on
account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or ca­
lamity requiring their discharge, or by consent of both par­ 
ties, or after they have been kept together until it satisfac­
torily appears that there is no probability of their agreeing. 
§ 353. In nil cases where the jury are discharged during
the trial or after the cause is submitted to them, it may be 
tried again, immediately or at a future time, as the court
may direct. 
§ 354. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict,
they must be conducted into court, their names called by 
the clerk, and the verdict rendered by their foreman. When 
the verdict is announced, either party may require the jury 
to be polled, which is done by the clerk or court asking each
juror if it is his verdict. If any one answers in the nega­ 
tive, the jury must again be sent out for further delibera­
tion. 
§ 355. The verdict shall be written, signed by the fore­
man, and read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry
made, whether it is their verdict. If any juror disagrees, 
the jury must be sent out again; but if no disagreement. is
expressed, and neither party requires the jury to be polled, 
the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged from the
case. 

§ 356. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. 
A general verdict is that by which they prono~nce, general­
ly, upon n11 or any of the issues, either in favor of the plain­
tiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by whicn the 
jury find the facts only. It must present the facts as estab­ 
lished by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them ;
and they must be so presented as that nothing remains to 
the court but to draw from them conclusions of law. 
§ 357. In all actions, the jury, in their discretion, may 
render a general or special verdict, but may be required by 
the court, in any case in which they render a general Vrrdict,
to find specially upon particular questions of fact to be stated 
in writing. This special finding is to be recorded with the
verdict. 
§ 358. When the special finding of facts is inconsistent
with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and 
the court may give judgment accordingly. 
§ 359. When, by the verdict, either party is entitled to 
recover money of the adverse party, the jury, in their ver­
dict, must assess the amount of recovery. 
§ 360. In actions for the recovery of specific personal
property, the jury must assess the value of the property, as 
also the damages for the taking or detention, whenever, by
their verdict, there will be a judgment for the recovery or
return of the property. 

§ 361. The trial by jury may be waived by the parties in
actions arising on contract, and, with the assent of the court, 
in other actions in the following manner:
1. By failing to appear at the trial. 
2. By written consent in person, or by attorney, filed 
with the clerk.
3. By oral consent in open court, entered on the 
record.
§ 362. Upon trials of questions of fact by the court, it 
shall not be necessary for the court to state its finding, ex­ 
cept, generally, for the plaintiff or defendant, unless one of
the parties requests it, with the view of excepting to the 
decision of the court upon the questions of law involved in
the trial; in which case the court shall state in writing tho 
oonoh11ion1 of fact found, separately from the conclusions of 
law. 

§ 363. An exception is an objection taken to a decision 
of the court upon a matter of law. 
§ 364. The party objecting to the decision, must except 
at the time the decision is made, and time may be given to 
reduce the exception to writing, but not beyond the succeed­
ing term. 
§ 365. No particular form of exception is required. The 
objection must be stated, with so much of the evidence as is 
necessary to explain it and no more, and the whole as briefly 
as possible. . 
§ 366. Where the decision objected to is. entered on the
record, and the grounds of objection appear in the entry, the
exception may be taken by the party causing to be noted, at
the end of the decision, that he excepts. 
§ 367. Where the decision is not entered on the record,
or the grounds of objection do not sufficiently appear in the
entry, the. party excepting must reduce his exception to
writing, and present it to the judge for his allowance and 
. signature. If true, it shall be the duty of the judge to al­
low and sign it; whereupon, it shall be filed with the plead­
ings as part of the record, but not spread nt large on the
order book. If the writing is not true, the judge shall oor­ 
reot it, or suggest the correction to be made, nnd sign it. If
the party excepting is not satisfied with the correction, upon 
his procuring the signatures of two by-standers attesting the
truth of his exception as by him prepared, the same shall be
filed as part of the record; but the- truth of the exceptions 
may be controverted and maintained by affidavits, not ex­ 
ceeding five in number on each side, to be filed with the 
clerk within ten days after the filing of the exception.
§ 368. No exception shall be regarded, unless it is mate­ 
rial and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the party ex­
cepting. 

§ 369. A new trial is a re-examination in the same court 
of an issue of fact after a verdict by a jury or a decision by
the court. The former verdict or decision may be vacated
and a new trial granted, on the application of the party ag­
grieved, for any of the following causes affecting materially
the substantial rights of such party : 
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury;
or prevailing party, or any order of court or abuse of
discretion, by which the party was prevented from hav­
ing a fair trial. 
2. Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party.
3. Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence 
could not have guarded against.
4. Excessive damages, appearing to have been given 
under the influence of passion or prejudice. 
5. Error in the asseeement of the amount of r&OO'V- 
ery, whether too large or too small, where the action
is upon a contract or for the injury or detention of prop­
erty. 
6. That the verdict or clecision is not sustained by
sufficient evidence, or is contrary to law. 
7. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party
applying, which he could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered and produced at the trial. 
8. En-or of law occurring at the trial, and excepted 
to by the party making the application. 
§ 370. A new trial shall not be granted. on account of
the smallness of damages in an action for an injury to 
the person or reputation, nor in any other action where
the damages shall equal the actual pecuniary injury sus­
tained. 
§ 371. The application for a new trial must be made at
the term the verdict or decision is rendered, and, except for
the cause mentioned in subdivision seven of section 369, shall
be within three days after the verdict or decision was ren­
dered, unless unavoidably prevented. . 
§ 372. The application must be by motion upon writ­
ten grounds filed at the time of making the motion. The
grounds mentioned in the second, third, and seventh subdi­
visions of section 369, must be sustained by affidavits show­
ing their truth, and may be controverted by affidavits. 
§ 373. Where grouuds for a new trial are discovered af:.
ter the term at which the verdict or decision was rendered,
the application may be made by a petition filed with the
clerk not later than the second term after the discovery, on 
which a summons shall issue, us on other petitions, requir­
ing the adverse party to appear and answer it, on or before
the first day of the next term. The application shall stand
for hearing at the term to which the summons is returned
executed, and shall be summarily decided by the court. 
The evidence may be either by depositions, or by wit-
nesses examined in court. But no such application shall be
made more than three years after the final judgment ll'ui-=: 
rendered. · · ·

trials by the court.

prosecuted by ordinary proceedings, in the order in which
they were brought. 
§ 378. The common docket shall be made out for each
term of the court; and the actions shall be set for par­
ticular days, and so arranged by the clerk that the cases
set for each day shall be tried, as nearly as may be. on

been presented, the defendant shall have the right of pro­
ceeding to the trial of his claim, although the plaintiff may
have dismissed his action or failed to appear.

such defendants if the action had been against them alone. 
§ 403. It shall not be necessary, in any action upon a
mortgage or lien, to enter an interlocutory judgment or

be the duty of the party or his attorney to enter satisfac­ 
tion in the judgment book, which shall be sufficiently done,
by writing the words "satisfied in full," with the date of the

court, which approval shall be indorsed on the conveyance,
and recorded with it.

ed by the commissioner only, without affixing the names of
the parties whose title is conveyed; but the names <Sf sueh

ecution on the ground that the personal representatives or
heirs of a deceased plaintiff are not properly stated in the

§ 497. The court rendering a judgment in favor of the
commonwealth, shall certify the amount thereof, together
with the costs, to the auditor; and shall also c~rtify the fees 
due to officers taking depositions, and to witnesses for at­
tendance on behalf of the commonwealth, for which the au­
ditor shall issue his warrant on the treasurer to the person 
entitled. 
§ 498. The attorney general may make out and certify

§ 499. The proceedings upon arbitrations and awards
made under an order or rule of court, shall be according to
the provisions of chapter three of the Revised Statutes, ex­
cept the words "of chancery," in the eighth section, which
shall be stricken out; which provisions as amended are ns 
follows;
1. All controversies which might be the subject of a 
suit or action may be submitted to the decision .of one 
or more arbitrators, or to two and their umpire, in the 
manner provided in this chapter. Parties may make
such submission by rule of any court having jurisdic­
tion of the subject matter. The parties making such
submission shall, where there is no suit or action pend­
ing, by written agreement filed, and noted on the re­
cord, or by an entry on the record, state what matter
is submitted. The rule of court shall state the time
in which the award is to be made and returned. The
court may enlarge the time for making and returning 
an 1ward. "
~~~:·'l\·Mbira~~·~nd,.the umpire, if there be one, be- 
fore they proceed to act, shall take an oath to decide
the controversy to them submitted according to law and
evidence and the equity of the case, to the best of their
judgment, without favor or affection; and a certificate
of such oath shall be · returned to the court with the
award. They shall have power to examine either party 
on oath at the request of his adversary.
3. Any one of the arbitrators shall have power to 
issue subpoenas for witnesses to attend their sittings
and give evidence thouching the matters referred to
them, to which all sheriffs and other like officers shall
give obedience. Witnesses failing to attend before ar­ 
bitrators at the time and place designated, or who shall
refuse to give evidence when they do attend, shall be 
reported to the court by the arbitrators, and proceeded
against and punished as if the case had been pending 
in court.
4. The personal representative of a decedent, guar­ 
dian of an infant, committee of an idiot or lunatic, or
any trustee, may make a submission, as herein provid­
ed for, touching the estat of such decedent, infant, or
insane person, or in respect to which he is trustee. Any
such submission, so made in good faith, and tfie award
made thereupon shall be binding, and entered as the 
judgment or decree of the court. No such fiduciary
shall be responsible for any loss sustained by an award 
adverse to the interest he, represents, unless the same
be caused by his fault or neglect. 
5. If any arbitrator shall fail or refuse to act, the
court may set aside the order of reference. 
6. The arbitrators and umpire, if there be one, shall
meet at such convenient times and places as may be
necessary, ( of which the parties shall have reasonable 
notice.) and hear such evidence as either party may 
adduce. They shall have power to administer oaths.
They shall make their award in writing, stating therein 
the time when it is made, and sign the same. When
the award is made out, one copy thereof shall be deliv­
ered to each of the contending parties, and the original
returned to the court, on which the arbitrators shall note
the time of delivering a copy to each party. 
7. If such award be made out and returned, and
copies delivered ten days before the term of the court
next succeeding such delivery, the same shall be en­
tered of record and made the judgment or decree of 
the court, unless on exceptions filed the award shall be 
set aside. 
8. No award shall be set aside for the want of form. 
But courts shall have power over awards on equitable
principles as heretofore. 
9. Matters within the jurisdiction of a justice of the
peace may be submitted to arbitrators, by an order, 
rule, or agreement entered on his record book in the
same manner, and the proceedings under it shall be the 
same in every respect, as are authorized and required in
other courts. Either party may appeal to the circuit
court from the judgment of the justice on the award, 
as in other cases.

witnesses at the request of either party, and their attendance
and testifyiug may be coerced by the justice who presides at 
the inquest.

every twenty words in such transcript. 
§ 511. If either party conceive himself aggrieved by the
finding of the jury, he may file a traverse thereof with the 
justice within three days next after the finding aforesaid, in 
substance· as follows : 
"AB against OD, on a writ of forcible entry [or detainer:] 
The plaintiff [ or the defendant] saith, that the inquisition

reasonable penalty to be fixed by the justice, with a condi­
tion, in substance as follows: 
"The condition of the above bond is such, that whereas an
inquisition of forcible entry [ or detainee] in which A B was 
plaintiff, and C D and E F were defendants, was found before 
---,. a justice of the peace for Raid county in favor of
said A B, on the -- day of , which inquisition hath

penses of the traversee in defending the traverse, not exceed­
ing the penalty of the bond. 
§ 513. The clerk shall docket the traverse us other ac­
tions ; it shall stand for trial as docketed ; the traversec
shall join issue on the traverse; it shall be tried by a jury, and

§ 519. The manner of proving wills and contesting their
probate, shall be as directed in sections 27 to 42, inclusive,
of chapter 106, of the Revised Statutes, except that a peti­
tion in equity shall be filed wherever a bill in chancery is 
directed therein, which sections are as follows : 
1. Wills shall be proved before, and admitted to re­
cord by, the county court of the county of the testa­ 
tor's residence; if he had no known place of residence
in this state, and land is devised, then in the county
where the land, or the greater part thereof lies; if no
land is devised. then in the county where he died or 
~' ~'tha~~\hi~la~, or the greater part thereof, shall
\. lie, or where there may be any debt or demand owing 
to him. · 
2. A writ of error, or an appeal, shall lie from the
county court to the circuit court of the same county,
and thence to the court of appeals, upon every order
admitting a will to record, or rejecting it. The cir­
cuit court and court of appeals shall try both law and
fact, but the court of appeals shall not hear or adjudge
any matter of fact pertaining thereto other than such 
as may be certified from the circuit court. The writ 
of error from the circuit court shall be sued out with­
in five years after rendering the order of probate or
rejection in the county court, and from the court of ap­ 
peals within one year after the final decision in the cir­
cuit court. 
3. No will shall be received in evidence, until it has
been allowed and admitted to record by a county
court; and its probate before such court shall be con­ 
clusive, until the same is superseded, reversed, or an­
nulled. 
4. Any such court, on being informed that n person 
has in his custody the will of a testator, may summon
him and, by proper process, compel him to produce the 
same. 
5. When a will of a non-resident of this state relative 
to estate within this state has been proved without the
same, an authenticated copy thereof and the certificate
of probate' thereof may be offered. for probate in this
state. When such copy is so offered, the court to which 
it is offered shall presume, in the absence of evideaoe 
to the contrary, that the will was duly executed and ad­ 
mitted to probate as a will of personalty in the state or
country of the testator's domicil, and shall admit such
copy to probate as a will of personalty in this state. 
And if it appears from such copy that the will was prov­
ed in the foreign court of probate to have been so exe­
cuted as to be a valid will of lands in this state by the
law thereof, such copy may be admitted to probate as a 
will of real estate. 
6. When any will or any such authenticated copy is
offered for probate, and a witness attesting the same re­
sides out of this state, or though in the state is in con­
finement in another county or corporation under legal
process, or is unable from sickness, age, or other infirmi­ 
ty, to attend the court before which the same is of­
fered, or resides at a distance of more than fifty miles,
such court may cause a commission to be issued, an­ 
nexed to the said will or copy, and directed to any
person authorized by law to take depositions in other 
cases, to take his deposition. The deposition of such
witness shall be taken and certified as depositions are 
taken in other cases; except that no notice need be 
given of the time and place of taking the same, un­
less it is in a case in which the probate is opposed by
some person who has made himself a party. And 
the proof so given shall have the same effect as if it 
had been given in the court from which the commis­
sion issued. 
7. A person offering or intending to oiler to a coun­ 
ty court a will for probate, may obtain from the clerk
of such court process directed to the proper officer of!
any county, requiring him to su~mon any person inter- 
. " . 
ested in such probate to appear at the next term of such
court, and show cause why the said will should not be 
admitted to record. 
8. The court to which a will is offered for probate,
may cause all persons interested in the probate to be
summoned to appear on a certain day. 
9. Any person interested in such probate may be 
summoned, or proceeded against by order of appear­
ance; and to any person so interested who is an infant
or of unsound mind, a guardian ad lit em may be assign­
ed as in other cases. 
10. When the proceeding is taken to the circuit
court, all necessary parties shall be brought before the 
court; and upon the demand of any one of them, a
jury shall be impanneled to try which or how much of
any testamentary paper produced is, or is not, the last
will of the testator. If no jury be demanded, the
court shall determine that question, and the final decis­
ion given shall be a bar to any other proceeding to call
the probate or rejection of the will in question-sub­
ject to the right of appeal or writ of error to the court
of appeals as hereinbefore named; but nothing in this section shall preclude a court of chancery from its 
jurisdiction to impeach such final decision, for such rea­
son as would give it jurisdiction over any other judg­ 
ment at law.
11. A county court may, however, without summon­ 
ing any party, proceed to probate and admit the will to
record or reject the same. 
12. Any person interested, who, at the time of the
final decision in the circuit court, resided out of this
state, and was proceeded against by order of appearance
only without actual appearance or being personally serv- 
~~,u, rrocess,~id a~y ~her pei:,-,g_n intereited who 
,·ft~D~~~~y t \lte~~ceeaing~~tuilP4>~\irance
or being ~rsonal y served with process, may, within 
three years after such final decision in the circuit court, 
by bill in chancery impeach the decision and have a re­ 
trial of the question of probate; and either party shall
be entitled to a jury for the trial thereof. An infant,
not a party, shall not be barred of such proceeding in
chancery until twelve months after attaining full age. 
13. But no such proceeding in chancery for establish­
ing or avoiding a will, shall operate further than is ne­
cessary to the rights of such infant, non-resident, or oth­
er party, or otherwise affect the rights of any other per­ 
son interested in the probate.
14. The record of what is proved or deposed in court 
by witnesses on the motion to admit a will to record,
and any depositions lawfully taken out of court on such
motion, of witnesses who cannot be produced at a trial 
afterwards before a jury, may, on such trial, be admit­ 
ted as evidence, to have such weight as the jury shall
think they deserve. 
15. Every will or authenticated copy so admitted to
record by any court shall be recorded by the clerk
thereof and remain in his office, except during such
time as the same may be carried to another court under 
a subpama duces tecum.
16. A will may be deposited by the person making 
it, or any one for bim, with the clerk of tho county
court of the county of his residence, for safe keeping,
upon payment of a fee of one dollar to the clerk, who 
shall receive, keep, and deliver the same according to 
t~e directions on a sealed envelope. If there are no
such directions, or the party entitled does not apply,
the will shall be handed to and opened by the next or
some succeeding county court, after the death of the 
testator.
§ 520. The accounts of personal representatives, guardi­
ans, committees of idiots and lunatics, may be settled in the 
manner and by the mode of proceeding provided in chap· 
ter 27, article 22, of the Revised Statutes, which are as fol·
lows: 
1. The presiding judge of the county court shall 
make settlements with personal representatives and
guardians in his county. He shall be allowed one dol­
lar and fifty cents for each settlement. If the same 
occupies him more than one day, then one dollar and
fifty cents per day, to be paid out of the estate settled. 
The law requiring three commissioners to be appointed
to make such settlements is hereby repealed. If, in 
any case, the judge cannot make such settlement with
propriety, then the clerk of the county court may make 
the same. rlf he cannot act with propriety, the judge
may appoint some discreet person, not of kin to either
party, to make the settlement. The judge may, if he
thinks proper, appoint a standing commissioner to make
such settlement. 
2. It shall be the duty of the presiding judge of
each county, when called on by a personal representa­ 
tive or guardian, or committee, or any person interested,
to state and settle the accounts of such fiduciary. He
shall have power to hear testimony on such settlement 
in support or in opposition to any item. He must re­
duce to writing all verbal evidence adduced before him.
He is in all cases to be governed by law and justice,
and shall give DO credit to U. fiduciary for disbursements
or for services without evidence to justify the same. 
His report, in writing, he shall return to the clerk of
the county court. The report shall show the result, 
giving items of debit and credit, and he shall return
therewith all vouchers and evidence adduced before him
on the settlement. The clerk shall indorse on the re­
port the time of filing the same, and it shall lay over
one term for exceptions to be filed by any person inter­
ested. If no exceptions are filed by the second tenn 
of t~\ 9Qurt, the 1luort ~all....i( apQE(?Ved, be recorded.
If exc~~tions~\lfl~, \~~de~e~lides that re­ 
ported \iay be lieard, and the court shall, upon the
whole case, alter or amend the report and order it to be
recorded, or so order it without altering or amending it,
as shall appear right and legal. The vouchers accom- 
pa.nying the report shall not be recorded, but must be
carefully kept on file in the clerk's office. Any new 
evidence given in court must be reduced to writing and
filed with the report. Settlements so made and re­
corded shall be prima f 'acie evidence between the par­
ties interested. Notice of the time and place of such
settlement must be given to all parties interested, if 
resident in the county. Any fiduciary failing to settle
when so notified, without good excuse, shall, on notice 
thereof, be fined by the county court twenty dollars.
Witnesses may be summoned at the instance of either
party, to give evidence before the judge on the settle­
ment, or on the trial of exceptions by the court, and
their attendance may be coerced by attachment and
fine. In making settlements the judge may adjourn
from clay to day, so long as the business requires it. 
Ho may interrogate personal representatives and guar­
dians, on oath, touching any matter drawn in question
in making a settlement, and their statements, when
so interrogated, must be reduced to writing and re­
turned with the report. No evidence shall be presumed
to have been given on n settlement except such as is
reported. 
§ 521. The accounts of trustees may be settled in the
same manner, and the settlements shall have the same ef­ 
fect as prescribed in regard to the settlements of the fidu­
ciaries named in the last section. The county court, in the
clerk's office of which the deed or will creating the trusts
is recorded, shall have the jurisdiction of making the settle­
ments. 

§ 522. The proceedings on caveats shall be according to 
the provisions of chapter 11, of the Revised Statutes, which
are as follows: 
1. If any person obtains a survey of land to which
another claims a better right, such other may enter a 
caveat 'with the register to prevent the issuing. of a
grant until the right is determined. The caveat shall
state the plaintiff's claim, and the reasons why the grant
should not issue. It shall be verified by his affidavit, 
or by that of his agent, and declare that it is entered
in good faith, with the intention of procuring the land
for the plaintiff, and not for the benefit of the person
against whom it is entered. A copy of the caveat, 
certified by the register, shall, within fifteen days from
the time it was entered, be handed to the clerk of the 
circuit court of the county where the land, or the great­
er part thereof, lies, who shall immediately issue a sum­
mons thereon, returnable to the first day of the next 
term of the court, against the defendant, and renew
the same from term to term, if required. If the sum­ 
mons be not returned, or be returned not executed, the 
caveat shall be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff,
unless it appear that the non-return or non-execution
was not occasioned by the neglect of the plaintiff. If
the summons is executed fifteen days before the first day
of the term, and the caveat shall stand for trial at that 
term, and the defendant shall, on or before its call, file his
written response thereto, verified by his affidavit. If
the summons be not so executed, it shall stand for trial 
at the next term after it is so executed. All issues of
fact made by the caveat and the response shall be tried
by a jury, if required by either party. If the defend­ 
ant be a non-resident of this state, he may be proceed­
ed against, and with the like effect, as is permitted
against a non-resident in any other suit. Upon service
of the summons, or upon notice to plaintiff of the filing
of defendant's response in the clerk's office during va­
cation, either party, respectively, may proceed to take 
depositions. The court may permit an amendment of
the statement contained in the caveat or response, and
may give time for further preparation. If the copy of
the caveat be not lodged with the clerk within the fifteen 
days, it shall be deemed to be abandoned; and upon
certificate from the clerk that none such has been left. 
with him, the register may proceed in disregard of the
caveat. The court may, in its discretion, require the 
plaintiff to give security for costs, and on his failure fo 
give the same, dismiss his suit.
2. The judgment upon a caveat shall be liable to re­ 
vision in the court of appeals, by appeal or writ of er­
ror, in the same manner, in all respects, as any other
judgment of the circuit court. 
3. A copy of the judgment, if in favor of the de­
fendant, must be delivered into the land office within
three months from the time it is rendered, or a new
caveat may, for that cause, be entered against the 
grant. If the judgment be for the plaintiff, and a copy
thereof not delivered into the land office within six 
months from the time it was rendered, any other person
may, for that cause, enter another caveat ngainst the
grant. 
4. No gi1tnt shall issue to the land in contest to the
plaintiff in the caveat, or to another for his use, until
the caveat is dismissed or decided; and any such grant,
to the extent of such land, shall be void. 
5. Where the plaintiff does not prosecute his cave­
at as herein required, or the same is dismissed or de­
cided against him, neither he nor any other for his
use, shall have another caveat against the same grant. 

§ 524. The court shall hear and decide all questions of 
law or fact arising in the motion, and the granting or refus­
ing of the writ shall be the final order in the motion. 
§ 525. During the pendency of the motion, the court, or
judge in vacation, may make temporary orders for prevent­
ing damage or injury to the applicant until the motion is
decided. 
§ 526. The writ of' mandamus, as treated of in this chap­
ter, is an order of a court of competent and original juris­
diction, commanding an executive or ministerial officer to
perform an act, or omit to do an act, the performance or
omission of which is enjoined by law, and is granted on the
motion of the party aggrieved, or of the commonwealth
when the public interest is affected. 
§ 527. Where the interests, rights, or claims of the com­
monwealth are affected by the final order on an application
for a writ of mandamus, the attorney general may prosecute
an appeal without any security whatever. 
§ 528. The writ of prohibition is an order from the circuit
court to an inferior court of limited jurisdiction, prohibiting
it from proceeding in a matter out its jurisdiction. 

§ 529. In lieu of the writs of acire faciaa and quo warran­

children. 
2. That his unsoundness of mind is confirmed and
incurable.

prospectively beneficial to his wife and children. 
5. That his wife and children being made parties to 
the proceeding, in proper person if of full age, or by

held jointly with another or others, though not necessary
for the payment of the debts of said person, or for his or

or other court of equal jurisdiction, where it shall appear to 
the court from affidavits, depositions, or other legal evidence, 
that the interest of such other joint owner or owners would 
be advanced thereby, and the interest of said person of un­
sound mind would not be injuriously affected thereby; and the
proceeds of the sale shall be disposed of in the same manner 
as the proceeds of real estate of lunatics now authorized by

joint tenants, or tenants in common, some of whom are in­
fants, or persons of unsound mind, the circuit court, or other 
court of similar equitable jurisdiction, may, upon the peti­
tion of a part of such owners against the others, or of the 
trustee against such owners, or of the owners against the
trustee, and upon its being proven that a division of such 
land would materially impair its value, order a sale thereof
and a division of the proceeds among those entitled. Before
such sale is ordered, the court shall appoint some suitable
persons to take care of the interests of the infants, or persons
of unsound mind ; and the shares of such infants, or persons
of unsound mind, shall not be paid by the purchaser, but
remain a lien upon the land, bearing interest, until they be­
come capable in law of receiving their respective shares, or
until statutory guardians shall be appointed for the infants,
or committees for the persons of unsound mind, or the infants
shall become married, and such guardians, committees, or
husbands, give bond as required in chapter 86 of the Revis­
ed Statutes. 
§ 544. A sale of the land or slaves of infants, persons of

a trustee, he shall be a party to the proceedings for their 
sale, and in all other respects the proceedings for the sale of 
land and slaves held in trust for infants, married women, and
persons of unsound mind, shall be the same as where they
hold the legal title, except that the trustees shall give bond
and security, instead of the guardian, committee, or hus­
band, where the proceeds of sale are to go into the hands of 
s\ich trustee. 
§ 546. Any person desiring a division of land or slaves
held in joint tenancy, in common, or in co-parcenary, or an al­ 
lotment of dower, by the county court, shall file in said court,
or in the clerk's office thereof in vacation, a written petition, 
in which a description of the property, the names of those
having an interest in it, and the amount of such interest,

the division or allotment, and thereupon all persons interest­
ed in the property who have not united in the petition, shall
be summoned to appear and answer the petition, on the first 
day of the next term of the court. 
§ 547. Upon such a petition by all interested in the prop­
erty being filed, or upon a summons being served upon all

ing shall be tried and determined by the county court, or the
case, on the motion of either party, shall be removed into
the circuit court for trial. 
§ 550. Upon such removal being ordered, the clerk of
the county court shall deliver to the clerk of the q_uit 
court the petition, summons, answer, and other papers fifed 
therewith, and a copy of the order of removal, whereupon

death of the party, or the cessation of his powers, being
stated on the record. 
§ 558. Where one of several plaintiffs or defendants dies,
or his powers as a personal representative cease, if the cause 
of action does not admit of survivorship, and the court is of
opinion that the merits of the controversy can be properly
determined, and the principles applicable to the case fully 
settled, it may proceed to try the cause as between the re­
maining parties; but the judgment shall not prejudice any 
who were not parties at the time of the trial.

summons, upon the party adverse to the one making the
motion. And, at the first term commencing not less than 
ten days after such service, the party upon whom it is made
may show cause against the revivor; and, if sufficient cause 
is not then shown, the action shall stand revived.

tatives or successor of the party who died or whose powers
ceased, of the motion by the adverse party for an order t.o 
revive the action in their names, or to the adverse party
where the motion is by such representatives or successor, and
due return is made of the service .of the notice, the court
may, if sufficient cause is not shown to the contrary, make
an order reviving tho action in the names of such parties;
whereupon, the action shall stand revived. 
§ 564. Where it appears to the court by the affidavit of
the plaintiff that the representatives of the defendant, or
any of them, in whose name the action is ordered to be re ..
vived, are non .. residents of this state, or have left the same

from four months, or so conceal themselves that the order
cannot be served upon them, or that the names of the heirs
of the defendant against whom the· action is ordered to be 
revived, or of some of them, are unknown to the affiant, an
order may be made by the court warning such representa- 
tives or unknown heirs to appear on the first day of its next
term, and show cause why the action should not be revived
against them. The parties so warned shall be deemed con­
structively served with a copy of the order of revivor ten
days before the term at which they are warned to appear;

tion shall, at that term, stand revived.

§ 570. An order to revive an action in the names of the
representatives or successor of a plaintiff, may be made
forthwith, but shall not be made without the consent of the
defendant after the expiration of one year from the time the

defendant shall also have died or his powers have ceased in
the meantime, the order of revivor on both sides may be

ther party to an action has been dead, or, where he sues or is
sued as n personal representative, that his powers have ceased
for a period so long that the action cannot be revived in the

sent of both parties, it shall order the action to be stricken
from the docket.

tatives, in whose names the action might be revived, ten

to strike the action from the docket, and for costs against
the estate of the plaintiff, unless the action is forthwith
revived.

securities obtained under it shall be preserved to the modified
judgment.

ination on the trial of a civil action, except in the county of

erally, "to any officer authorized to take depositions in or
out of this state." 
§ 641. Upon filing with an examiner, or other officer au­
thorized to take depositions, a notice duly served, or a com­
mission with interrogatories to take a deposition, it shall be

witness, whose deposition is desired, to appear, at a time and
place to be named in the subpoena, for examination; and if

officer may issue his warrant for arresting and bringing the 
witness before him, to give testimony, and answer for the
contempt of disobedience of the subpoena. 
§ 642. The officer before whom the deposition is taken
shall decide, summarily, all objections to questions, but in
matters of doubt shall permit the questions to be answered,

the presence of the officer taking it, either by the witness or
the officer.

ten, and which of the parties, in person or by agent or attor­
ney, was present at the examination of the witness. 
§ 646. When the depositions are completed they shall be
sealed up by the officer and directed to the clerk of the court
in which the action is pending, with a note showing them 
to be depositions, and the style of the case in which they
were taken, and either delivered to the clerk or mailed to
him by the officer taking them. 
§ 647. The fee allowed an officer for taking depositions
shall be one dollar for each deposition, and five cents per mile
for each mile that an examiner may have to travel in going

case, and noted on the record.
§ 651. No exception, other than to the competency of the 
witness, or to the relevancy or competency of the testimony,
shall be regarded, unless filed and noted on the record before
the commencement of the trial. 
§ 652. The court on the motion of either party, shall de­
cide upon the exceptions before the commencement of the
trial. 
§ 653. Errors of the court in its decisions upon excep­
tions to depositions, are waived unless excepted to. 
§ 654; Where the trial is by jury, the swearing of the
jury shall be deemed the commencement thereof. 

§ 655. A party desiring to take depositions in this state
to be used in judicial proceedings in other states, may pro- 
duce to a judge of the county court in the county where the
witnesses reside a commission authorizing the taking of such
depositions, or a notice duly served; whereupon, it shall be
the duty of the judge to issue a subpoena requiring the 
witnesses to attend at a specified time and place for exami­
nation; and, in case of their failure to attend or refusal to 
be sworn or to testify, they may be punished as provided in section 598. 

§ 656. The party who begins the case, must ordinarily
exhaust his evidence before the other begins. But the order
of proof shall be regulated by the court, so as to expedite
the trial, and enable the tribunal to obtain a clear view of
the whole evidence. 
§ 657. The court shall exercise a reasonable control over
the mode of interrogation so as to make it rapid, distinct, as
little annoying to the witness, and as effective for the ex­
traction of the truth as may be; but subject to this control, 
the parties may put such legal and pertinent questions as
they may see flt, The court, however, may stop the pro­ 
duction of further evidence on a particular point, where the
evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reasonable 
doubt. 
§ 658. The examination of a witness by the party pro­
ducing him, is the direct examination; the examination of
the same witness upon the same matter, by the adverse par­
ty, the cross-examination. The direct examination must be
completed before the cross-examination begins, unless the
court otherwise directs. 
§ 659. A question that suggests to the witness the an­
swer which the examining party desires, is a leading ques­
tion. On the direct examination, leading questions are not 
allowed, except under special circumstances making it ap­
pear that the interests of justice require it. On cross-ex­ 
amination, the adverse party may put leading questions;
but if he examines the witness on new matters, such ex­ 
amination is subject to the same rules as the direct examina­
tion. 
§ 660. The party producing a witness is not allowed to 
impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, unless it is
a case in which it was indispensable that the party should 
produce him; but he may contradict him by other evidence,
and by showing that he has made statements different from
his present testimony. 
§ 661. A witness may be impeached by the party against
whom he is produced, by contradictory evidence, by showing 
that he has made statements different from his present testi­
mony, or by evidence that his general reputation for truth
or immorality renders him unworthy of belief, but not by
evidence of particular wrongful acts, except that it may be
shown by the examination of a witness, or record of a judg­ 
ment, that he has been convicted of felony. 
§ 662. Before other evidence can be offered of the witueaa 
having made at another time a different statement, he must 
be inquired of concerning the same, with the circumstances
of time, place, and persons present, as correctly as the ex­
amining party can present them; and if it is in writing, it
must be shown to the witness, and he allowed to explain it. 
§ 663. Evidence of the good character of a witness is
inadmissible until his general reputation has been impeach­
ed. 
§ 664. A witness once examined, cannot be re-examined
as to the same matter, without leave of the court. But he
may be re-examined as to any new matter upon which he
has been examined by the adverse party. After the exami­
nation on both sides is concluded, the witness cannot be
recalled without leave of the court. 
§ 665. If either party requires it, the judge may exclude
from the court room any witness of the adverse party not at 
the time under examination, so that he may not hear the
testimony of the other witnesses. 
§ 666. A person present before a court or a judicial offi­
cer, may be compelled to testify in the same manner as if
he was served with a subpeena. 
§ 667. The judge or a juror may be called as a witness
by either party, but in such case, it is in the discretion of
the court to suspend the trial and order it to take place be­
fore another judge or jury; and where a party knows, at 
the time the jury are sworn, that a juror is to be called by
him as a witness, he shall then disclose it, and the juror shall
be excluded from the jury. 
§ 668. Whenever a writing is shown to a witness, it may 
be inspected by the adverse party, and, if proved by the
witness, it mus, he read to the jury before his testimony is
closed; otherwise, it cannot be read, unless the witness is 
recalled. 

§ 669. All persons, except those enumerated in the next section, shall be competent to testify in a civil action. 
§ 670. The following persons shall be incompetent to 
testify:
I. Persons convicted of a capital offense, or of per­ 
jury, subornation of perjury, burglary, robbery, lar­
ceny, receiving stolen goods, forgery, or counterfeiting. 
2. Infants under the age of ten years, and over that
age, if incapable of understanding the obligation of an 
oath.
3. Persons who are of unsound mind at the time of 
being produced as witnesses.
4. Husband and wife, for or against each other, or

dian. 
§ 671. All other objections to witnesses shall go to their
credit alone, and be weighed by the jury or tribunal to
which their evidence is offered. 
§ 672. In actions by equitable proceedings, if a party, in
answering interrogatories, state new matters not responsive 
to the inquiries, the party interrogating may, before the
trial, file his written statement under oath, concerning such 
new matters, which shall be read as a deposition, 
§ 673. In actions by ordinary proceedings, if a party, in
answering interrogatories or when introduced as a witness,
states new matters not responsive to the inquiries of the
adverse party, the latter shall be allowed to testify orally
concerning such new matter. 
§ 674. A personal representative or trustee not personal­ 
lyc interested in the action, shall not be incompetent to testi­
fy by reason of being a party. 
§ 675. An officer or inhabitant of a county, city, or town, 
or an officer, member, or trustee of a corporation or religious
society, although a party to the action, shall be competent
to testify in behalf of such county, city, town, corporation, 
or religious society. 
§ 676. A person desiring to perpetuate the testimony of.
a witness residing in this state, may present to a circuit 
judge or the presiding judge of a county court an affidavit
stating 
I. That the affiant expects to be a party to an ac­
tion in a court of this state, and that the expected ad­
verse party, whose name shall be stated, is of full age,

diately brought, where the affiant expects to be plain­
tiff.

ed adverse party with a copy of the affidavit and order, t!nd

interest, the deposition taken as above prescribed, may be
read by either party, where the witness is dead or insane, 
or, if alive and of sound mind, where his attendance for 
oral examination cannot be required ; and every part of it 
shall be subject to like objections as if taken pending the
action. 
§ 682. Where the trial is not in the county in which the
deposition is filed, a certified copy of it and of the affidavit,
order, notice, and proof of service, may be read as evi­
dence. 
§ 683. That evidence which has been or may be perpetu­
ated agreeably to the provisions of part 3, title 13, may be

defendant having answered, may serve upon the plaintiff or
his attorney an offer in writing that, if he fails in his defense, 
the amount of the recovery shall be assessed at a specified
sum. If the plaintiff accepts the offer and gives notice there­
of to the defendant or his attorney within five days after it
was served, and the defendant fails in his defense, the judg­ 
ment shall be for the amount so agreed upon. If the plain­
tiff does not accept the offer, he shall prove the amount to 
be recovered, as if the offer had not been made. The offer

question of amount, to be taxed under the direction of the 
court.

ions of this chapter, shall not be a cause for a continuance
of an action or a postponement of a trial. 

§ 705. Parties to a question which might be the subject
of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon a case
containing the facts upon which the controversy depends,
and present a submisssion of the same to any court which 
would have jurisdiction if an action had been brought. But
it must appear by affidavit that the controversy is real, and 
the proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights of the
parties. The court shall, thereupon, hear and determine
the case, and render judgment as if an action were pend­
ing. 
§ 706. The case, the submission, and the judgment shall
constitute the record. 
§ 707. The judgment shall be with costs, may be enforc­

in the submission .. 

§ 708. After an action for the recovery of money is
brought, the defendant may offer in court to confess judg­
ment for part of the amount claimed, or part of the causes 
involved in the action. Whereupon, if the plaintiff, being
present, refuses to accept such confession of judgment in 
full of his demands ngai'nst the defendan t in the action, or
having had such notice that the offer would be made, of its
amount, and of the time of making it as the court shall
deem reasonable, fails to attend, and, on the trial, does not
recover more than was so offered to be confessed, such plain­
tiff shall pay all the coste of the defendant incurred after the 
offer. The offer shall not be deemed to be an admission of
the cause of action or amount to which the plaintiff is enti­
tled, nor be given in evidence upon the trial. 

§ 709. If an officer who levies or is required to levy an 
execution upon personal property, doubts whether it is sub­
ject to the execution, he may give to the plaintiff therein, or 
his agent or attorney, notice that an indemnifying bond is
required. Bond may, thereupon, be given by or for the
plaintiff, with one or more sufficient sureties to be approved
by the officer, to the effect that the obligors therein will 
indemnify him against the damages which he may sustain in 
consequence of the seizure or sale of the property, and will
pay to any claimant thereof the damages he may sustain in 
consequence of the seizure or sale, and will warrant to any
purchaser of the property such estate or interest therein as 
is sold ; and, thereupon, the officer shall proceed to subject
the property to the execution, and shall return the indemni­ 
fying bond to the circuit court of the county in which the
levy is made. 
§ 710. If the bond mentioned in the last section is not

property to the person from whose possession it was taken,
and the levy shall stand discharged. 
§ 711. The claimant or purchaser of ai:1y property, for the
seizure or sale of which an indemnifying bond has been taken 
and returned by the officer, shall be barred of any action
against the officer levying on the property, if the surety in
the bond was good when it was taken. And such claimant
or purchaser may maintain an action upon the bond, and
recover such damages as he may be entitled to. 
§ 712. Where property, for the sale of which the officer is
indemnified, sells for more than enough to satisfy the execu­
tion under which it was taken, the surplus shall be paid into
the court to which the indemnifying bond is directed to be
returned. That court 'may order such disposition or pay­
ment of the money to be made temporarily or absolutely, as
may be proper, in respect to the rights of the parties inter­ 
ested. 
§ 713. The sale of personal property upon which an exe­
cution is levied, shall be suspended· at the instance of any
person, other than the defendant in the execution, claiming
the property, who shall execute, with one or more sureties 
sufficient for double its value, a bond to the plaintiff in the 
execution, to the effect that, if it shall be adjudged that the 
property or any part of it is subject to the execution, he will

execution, nnd ten per cent. thereon.

on ngninst all or any of the obligors or their representa­
tives, h..ving given to them ten days notice of the motion.

cause such issues to be tried as it may prescribe, and di· 
rcct which party shall be considered plaintiff in the issues. 
If the property, or any part of it, is found subject to the
execution, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the
plaintiff therein for the value of the property so subject, and
ten per cent. thereon, not exceeding the amount due on the
execution and ten per cent. thereon. An execution may be
issued upon the judgment forthwith, on which the same in­
dorsement shall be made as on the execution in virtue of
which the property had been seized. 
§ 717. Upon the trial of the motion, either party mny
object that the property was not fairly npprnised ; and, there­ 
upon, the jury trying the facts shall hear evidence respect­
ing and find the value of the property. 
§ 718. The giving of the bond mentioned in section 714,
shall not discharge the levy of the execution upon the prop­
erty claimed, But the officer may leave it, subject to the
lien of the levy, with the person in whose possession it was 
found, pending the proceeding on the bond; nnd may, in the
meantime, proceed with the execution ngainst any other prop­
erty of the defendant.

wurrant, with ten per cent. thereon, if the property is of the
