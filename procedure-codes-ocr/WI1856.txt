parties united in interest and pleading together, by
one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts, if

the state, or any officer thereof in its behalf is a party,
the verification may be made by any person acquainted

feot that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from
giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof,
or a county judge, may order a further account wheathe
one delivered is defective; and the court may in all caees
order a bill of particulars of the claim of either party to

of determining its effect, its allegations shall be lib.
erally construed with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.
SEC. 66. If irrelevant and redundant matter be inserted
in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of any
person aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations of a
pleading are so indefinite or uncertain, that the precise
nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the court
may require the pleading to be made definite and certain
by amendment.
SEc. 67. In pleading a judgment or other determination
of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction,'but
such judgment or determination may be stated to have
been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading shall be bound to establish on
the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.
SEC. 68. In pleading the peribriance of conditions pree
r cedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts showing such performance, but it may be stated
generally that the party duly performed all the conditions
on his part, and if such allegation be controverted, the
party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial,
the facts showing such performance. In an action or defence
founded upon an instrument for the payment of
money only, it shall be sufficient for the party to ive a
copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due to
himh thereon from the adverse party a specified sum which
he claims.
SEC. 69. In pleading a private statute or a right derived
therefrom, it shall be sufficient by to refer to such statute its title, and the day of its passage, and the court shall
thereupon take judicial notice thereof.
SEc. 70. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for
the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff.of
the defamatory matters out of which the cause of action
arose; but it shall be sufficient to state genrially, that the
,!same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff
and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall
rbe bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or
spoken.
SEC. 11. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating
circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages; and
whether he prove the justification or not, he may give
in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
SEC. 12 In an action to recover the possession of pro- distrained, doing damage, an answer that the de- fendant or person by whose command he acted was law. folly possessed of the real property upon which the dis- tress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing damage thereon, shall be good without
setting forth the title to such real property.
SEC. 73. The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several causes of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable or both, where they arise out of- 1. The same transaction or transactions connected with
the same subject of action;
2. Contract, express or implied;
8. Injuries with or without force to person and property,
or either; or,
4. Injuries to character; or,
5. Claims to recover real property with or without damages
for the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits
of the same; or,
68. Olaims to recover personal property with or without
damages for the withholding thereof; or,
7. Claims against a trustee by virtue of a contract, or
by operation of law.
SEC. 74. But the causes of action so united must all belong to one of these classes, and must affect all the par- ties to the action, and not require different places of trial, and must be stated respectively [separately.]
SEC. 15. Every material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section 54, and every material allegation of new matter in the answer constituting a counter claim, not controverted by
-the reply, as prescribed in section 59, shall, for the purposes
of the action, be taken as true.
SEC. 70. But the allegation oftnew matter in the answer,
not relating to a. counter claim, or of new matter in a
reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party
as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may
require.
SEC. 77. No variance between the allegation in a pleadane--
ing and the proof shall be deemed material, unless it shall actually mislead the adverse party to his prejudice in
maintaining his action or defence upon its merits. Whereever
it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled,
that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court,
and in what respect he has been misled, and thereupon
the court may order the pleading to be amended upon
such terms as may be just.
SEC. 78. Where the variance is not material as providvaImicea-
ed in the last section, the court m direct the fact to be , aydietheactob
found in accordance with the evidence, or may order an
immediate amendment without costs.
SEc. 79. When, however, the allegation of the cause of
action or defence to which the proof is directed, is unproved,
not in some particular or particulars only, but in
its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a
case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure
of proof.
SEc. 80. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course without costs, and without prejudice to
the proceeding already had, at any time before the period
for answering it expires, or it can be so amended at any
time within twenty days after the service of the answer
or demurrer to such pleading, unless it be made to appear
to the court that it was done for the purpose of delay,
and the plaintiff or defendant will thereby lose the benefit
of a term or circuit for which it is or may be noticed, and
If it appear to the court, that each amendment was made
for that purpose, the same may be stricken out and such
terms imposed as to the court may seem just. In such
case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on
the adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer,
either at a generel or special term, the court may, in its
discretion, it it appear that the demurrer was interposed
in good faith, allow the party to plead on such terms as
may seem just. If the demurrer be allowed for the cause
mentioned in the 5th sub-division of section 49, the
court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as
may be just, order the action to be divided into as many
actions as may be necessary to the proper determination
of the cause of action therein mentioned.
SEC. 81. The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceedings, by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the
case; or when the amendment does not change substan.
tially the claim or defence, by conformiig the pleading
or proceeding to the facts proved.
SEC. 82. The court may likewise in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or re- ply to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarge such time; and
may also in its discretion and upon sueh terms as may be
just, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve
a party from a judgment, order or other proceeding
taken against him through his mistake, inadvertance or
surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission
in any proceeding; and whenever any proceeding
taken by a party tails to conform in any respect to the
provisions of this code, the court nay in like manner and
upon like terms, permit an amendment of such proceeding
so as to make it conformable thereto.
SEC. 83. When the plainliff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name; and when his true name shall be discovered, the pleading or pro.
ceeding may be amended accordingly.
SEC. 81. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceed- which shall not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.
SEC. 85. The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplementalcomplaint, answer or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occur- ring after the former complaint, demur or reply, or of

personal services, at any time within sixty days next preceding

to appear by the debtor's aflidavit, or otherwise, that such
earnings are necessary for the use of a family, supported
wholly or in part by his labor.
SEC. 209. The judge may also, by order, appoint a re. of the property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner and with the like authority, as it the ap- pointment was made by the court, according to section 152 But before the appointment of such receiver, the
judge shall ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of the

interest till a tuflicient opportunity he given to the ro

or fees of attorneys, solicitors and, councel in civil actions,
and all existing rules and provisions of law restricting or
