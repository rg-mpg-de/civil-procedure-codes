Sec. 2. Any pleading which possesses the following requisites shall be deemed sulficientz '

1st. When to the common understanding it conveys a reasonable certainty of meaning;

2nd. When by a fair and natural construction it shows a
substantial cause of action or defense.

SEC. 3. If defective in the first of the above particulars, the
court on motion shall direct a mere specific statement; if in the
latter it is ground of demurrer.

SEC. 4. The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff is the
petition, which must contain a statement of the facts constituting
the cause of action as well as a claim of the remedy sought. If
money be the object of the action, the amount demanded must
be stated.

SEC. 5. The defendant shall demur or answer or do both on
or before the morning of the second day of the term at which he
is required to appear unless the court by general rule or special
order otherwise direct.

SEC. 6. The demurrer may be to one portion of the petition
and the answer to another, or each may apply to the whole.

SEC. 7. In the latter case the answer shall not be held to
overrule the demurrer, but the issue growing out of such pleadings shall be disposed of in their order.

SEC. 8. The defendant may also set up by way of set-ofi‘,
any claim which would have been the subject of an action against
the plaintiff and which was held by the defendant at the time
the suit was commenced. If the defendant omit to set off‘ his
claim, he cannot recover costs when he sues upon it.

SEC. 9. When the answer contains new matter by way of
avoidance or set-off, the plaintiff may reply thereto by way of
demurrer or otherwise, and like proceedings shall if necessary
be continued by way of rejoinder or farther pleadings until a
final issue is joined.

SEC. 10. Each pleading subsequent to the petition shall, in
relation to every affirmative allegation to which it should respond, containa specific admission or denial, or it must state some
sufficient reason for not doing so. Allegations not thus responded
to will be taken as true.

Sec. 11. Where the pleading thus shows a reason for not
admitting or denying a previous allegation it shall, for the purpose of forming an issue and putting the other party to the
proof, be regarded as a denial of the truth thereof.

SEC. 12. The plaintiff in his petition may at his option
require the answer of the defendant to be given under oath, and
in like manner the party filing any subsequent pleading setting
forth new matter may require the reply thereto to be given under
oath.

SEC. 13. Any pleading thus required to be made under oath
shall be considered as evidence in the cause of equal weight with
that of a disinterested witness, provided it be sworn to by the
party himself who was called upon to answer, but not otherwise.

SEC. 14. The pleading thus calling for a reply under oath
must itself be sworn to. If sworn to by any other than himself,
he must show that he has reasonable means of information on
the subject and what those means are.

SEC. 15. Where the reply under oath is to create much delay

or inconvenience the court may require satisfactory evidence (by
oath of the party or otherwise) that such sworn reply is important.

Sec. 16. Such reply must be sworn to by the party himself,
or some one of the parties, where there are several, or by some
one showing himself to be possessed of equal information with the
party on the subject matter thereof, and that he has authority to
make such sworn reply. N o pleading verified as above required
can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party, nor can
a party be compelled to state facts which if true would subject
him to a prosecution for felony.

SEC. 17. Either party may make a supplemental pleading
alledging any material facts which have come to his knowledge
since the filing of his former pleading.

SEC. 18. When a pleading is founded upon a written instrument or account, a copy thereof must be annexed to such pleading or it will be sufficient ground for a demurrer thereto. A
set off is a pleading within the meaning of this section.

SEC. 19. Several causes of action may be united in the same
petition provided they affect all the parties thereto in the same
capacities and if suit on all might be brought in that county.
But the court, to prevent confusion therein, may direct all or any
portion of the issues joined therein to be tried separately.

Sec. 20. Each party may state in either of his pleadings as
many different grounds of action or defense, whether legal or
equitable, as he may think material.

SEC. 21. The court may on motion cause irrevelant, redundant, or scandalous matter to be expunged from any pleading.

Sec. 22. Demurrers for formal defects are abolished. Those
for substantial defects must set forth the true grounds of objection to the pleading demurrcd to.

Sec. 23. Upon the determination of any demurrer the failing
party may amend or plead over upon such terms as the court
deems just, or as it may by general rule prescribe.

SEC. 24. No cause shall be continued in consequence of the

~ amendment of any pleading unless the court is satisfied that substantial justice requires such continuance.

Sec. 25. Immaterial variances, errors, or defects, may be
disregarded, or the court may direct an amendment without
costs.

SEC. 26. No variance, error, or defect, shall be deemed material unless the court is satisfied that the objecting party will
be prejudiced by disregarding it or by allowing it to be amended.
In such cases amendments shall be allowed in any stage of the
proceedings upon such terms as the court deems just.

SEC. 27. The court may allow material amendments at any
stage of the proceedings upon such terms and subject to such
rules as it may prescribe.

SEC. 28. If an original pleading or paper be lost or withheld

third of the number so demanded. Vacancies are to be supplied

may also be challenged for cause, and when allowed others
shall be summoned until the number of jurors is complete.

SEC. 14. When both parties desire it a struck jury may be
ordered, whereupon eighteen jurors shall be drawn from the

for specific real or personal property the jury in their discretion

the jury shall assess the amount of the recovery.

counter claim at any time before the jury withdraw.

Sec. 30. Money levied upon may be appropriated without
being advertised or sold. The same may be done with bank

Sec. 31. Where, by the endorsement of the clerk upon the_
writ, it appears that either of the persons against whom it issued
is only a surety for some of the others, the sheriff shall in selling first exhaust the property of the principal before he sells

SEC. 32. When the sheriff have doubts as to the defendant’s
ownership of personal property he may refuse to levy, or if he
has levied ‘Ngrnay refuse to sell, and may surrender the property
0 the claimant unless the plaintiff will first give him a bond of

there are such) setting forth the facts and that there is real estate of the deceased within the Territory, describing its location
and extent and praying the court to award execution against the
same. '

paid therefrom accordingly.

SEC. 40. When_ real property has been levied upon, if the

deed for the same.

time within one year from the day of sale as hereinafter provided and will in the meantime be entitled to the possession of

to redeem is exclusive, but if no redemption is made by him at
the end of that time any creditor of the defendant whose demand
isa lien upon such real estate, may redeem the same at any
time within nine months from the day ofsale. But a mecham'c’s

lien before judgment thereon is not of such a character as to entitle the holder to redeem.\

SEC. 44. Any creditor whose claim becomes a lien prior to
the expiration of the time allowed by law for redemption by
creditors may redeem. A mortgagee [may] only thus redeem
before or after the debt secured by the mortgage falls due.

to the payment of the debts of the deceased in the same manner
as if required during his life time.

Sec. 50. The purchaser of real estate at a sale on execution
need not place any evidence of his purchase upon record until
twenty days after the expiration of the full time of redemption.
Up to that time the publicity of the proceedings is constructive
notice of the rights of the purchaser but no longer.

SEC. 51. Deeds executed by a sheriff in pursuance of such
sales are presumptive evidence of the regularity of all previous
proceedings in the case, and may be given in evidence without
preliminary proof.

Sec. 52. When real estate has been sold on execution, the
purchaser thereof, or any person who has succeeded to his interest may, after his estate becomes absolute, recover damages
for any injury to the property committed after the sale, and before possession is delivered under the conveyance.

shall be returnable within sixty days from their date, those from
J ustice’s Courts within thirty days from date.

permitted to be made. And the interrogatories and answers

before whom they are taken.

SEC. 5. If any property, rights or credits subject to execution are thus ascertained, an execution may be issued and
they may be levied upon accordingly, and shall be sued as other
property levied on by execution, and the purchaser shall have

same manner as such defendant might have done. The plaintiff
may in all cases be a purchaser under his execution.

SEC. 6. Should the judgment debtor fail to appear after
being personally served with notice to that effect, or should he
fail to make full answers to all proper interrogatories thus propounded to him, he will be guilty of contempt and may be arrested and imprisoned until he complies with the requirement
of the law in this respect.Snc. 7. Upon proof to the satisfaction of the court or officer
authorized to grant the order aforesaid that there is danger that
the defendant will leave the Territory or that he will conceal

his examination as hereinbe fore provided. After being thus
brought before the said court or oflicer he may be examined in
the same manner and with the like effect as is above provided.

legal and sufficient reasons, or it may be re-committed for a rehearing to the same arbitrators or any others agreed upon by
the parties.

any arrangement for securing the payment of the debt when it
falls due, and which contemplated removal was not known to

he is attached? as garnishee, and by leaving with him a written
notice to the effect that he is required not to pay any debts due

court may be such as above prescribed to be asked by the sheriff
and such others as the court may think proper and right.

made liable for non-attendance.

SEC. 24. If when duly summoned and his fees tendered (if
demanded) he fail to appear and answer the interrogatories propounded to him without sufficient excuse for his delinquency,
he shall be presumed to be indebted to the defendant to the full
amount of the plaintiff’s demand, and shall be dealt with accordingly. »

much of said debts and property as is equal to the value of the
property to be attached, all of which may afterwards be treated

District Court, the plaintiff may controvert any facts contained
therein and specified by him, and issue being thereupon joinedmay be tried in the usual manner, upon such trial the answer ‘of

SEC. 28. If in any of the above methods it is made to appear
that the garnishee was indebted to the defendant, or had any of
the defendant’s property in his hands, either at the time of his
being served with the garnishee notice aforesaid, or at any time
subsequent thereto, he is liable to the plaintiff, in case judgment
is finally recovered by him, to the full amount of that judgment
or to the amount of such indebtedness, and of the property so
held by him. And a judgment shall be entered up against him
accordingly, unless he prefers paying or delivering the same to
the sheriff as above provided, but in case the debt due the defendant, is not then payable execution against the garnishee shall

and if such application has been made, a copy of the

V petition in that case with reason for the refusal thereto

for the failure to do so.

SEC. 2. This petition must be sworn to by the person confined
or [by some one in his behalf and presented to some court or]
officer authorized to allow the writ.

SEC. 3. The writ of habeas corpus may be allowed by the
Supreme or District Court, or by any judge of either of those
courts. In such cases it may be served in any part of the Territory.

SEC. 4. It may also be allowed by any Judge of Probate
except when the commitment was made by order of one of the
courts or ofiicers mentioned in the last section, but when allowed
by a Probate judge it [is] valid only within the limits of the
county where issued.

SEC. 5. Application for this writ, when made to the Supreme or District Court or to either of the judges thereof,
must be made to the court or judge most convenient in point
of distance to the applicant, and the more remote court or
judge if applied to for the writ may refuse the" same unlessa
suflicient reason be stated in the petition for not making the
application to the more convenient Supreme or District Court,
or a judge thereof.

SEC. 6. If, from the showing of the petitioner, the plaintiff
would not be entitled to any relief the court or judge may refuse

shall be allowed and may be substantially as follows :

The Territory of Nebraska,
To the Sheriff of &c. (or to A. B. as the case may be.)

You are hereby commanded to have the body of C. D. by you
unlawfully detained as is alledged, before the court (or before
me, or before E. F. judge &c. as the case may be) at
on—-————-- (or immediately after being served with this writ)
to be dealt with according to law and have you then and there
this writ with a return thereon of your doings in the premises.

   

SEC. 8. When a writ is allowed by a court it is to be issued
by the clerk, but when allowed by a judge he must issue the
writ himself subscribing his name thereto without any seal.

SEC. 9. If the writ is disallowed, the court or judge shall
cause the reasons for such disallowance to be appended to the
petition and returned to the person applying for the writ.

SEC. 10. Any judge, whether acting individually or as a
member of a court, who wrongfully and wilfully refuse such
allowance of the writ when properly applied for shall forfeit to
the party aggrieved the sum of one thousand dollars. ’

SEC. 11. Whenever any court or judge authorized to grant
this writ has evidence, from a judicial proceeding before them,
that any person within the jurisdiction of such court or officer
is illegally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, it is the duty
of such court or judge to issue or cause to be issued the writ as
aforesaid though no application be made therefor.

SEC. 12. The writ may be served by the sheriff or by any
other person appointed for that purpose by the court or judge
by whom it is issued or allowed. If served by any other person
than the sheriff, he possesses the same power and is liable to
the same penalty for non-performance of his duty as though he
were the sheriff.

SEC. 13. The proper mode of service is by leaving the original
writ with the defendant and preserving a copy thereof, on which
to make the return of service.

SEC. 14. If the defendant cannot be found or if he have
not the plaintiff in custody, the service may be made upon any
person having the plaintiff in his custody in the same manner
and with the same effect as though he had been made defendant
therein.

SEC. 15. If the defendant conceal himself or refuse admittance to the person attempting to serve the writ, or if he attempt
wrongfully to carry the plaintiff" out of the county or Territory
after the service of the writ aforesaid, the sheriff or the person
who is attempting to serve or who has served the writ as above
contemplated is authorized to arrest the defendant and bring him
forthwith with the plaintiff ‘ before the oflicer or court before
whom the writ is made returnable.

SEC. 16. In order to make such arrest the sheriff or such

person having the writ possesses the same poweras is given to a
sheriff for the arrest of a person- charged with a felony.

Sec. 17. If the plaintiff can be found and if no one appear
to have charge of him, the person having the writ may take
him into custody, and make return accordingly. And to get
possession of the plaintiff’s person in such cases he possesses the
same power as is given by the last section for the arrest of the
defendant.

Sec. 18. The court or judge to whom the application for the
writ is made, if satisfied that the plaintiff would suffer any irreparable injury before he could be relieved by the proceedings as
above authorized, may issue a precept to the sheriff or any
other person selected, commanding him to bring the plaintiff
forthwith before such court or judge.

SEC. 19. When the evidence aforesaid is further sufficient
to justify the arrest of the defendant for a criminal offense committed in connection with the illegal detention of the plaintiff,
the precept must also contain an order for the arrest of the
defendant.

SEC. 20. The oflicer or person to whom the precept is directed must execute the same by bringing the defendant, and
also the plaintiff if required, before the court or judge issuing
it, and thereupon the defendant must make return to the writ of
habeas corpusin the same manner as if the ordinary course had
been pursued.

SEC. 21. The defendant may also be examined and committed, or bailed and discharged, according to the nature of the
case. .
Sec. 22. The writ of habeas corpus must not be disobeyed
for any defect of form or misdescription of the plaintiff or defendant provided enough is stated to show the meaning and intent
of the writ.

Sec. 23. Service being made in any of the modes herein-P
before provided, the defendant must appear at the proper time
and answer the said petition.

Sec. 24. He must also bring up the body of the plaintiff‘, or
show good cause for not doing so.

Sec. 25. A wilful failure to comply with the above requisitions render the defendant liable to be attached for a contempt
and to be imprisoned till a compliance is obtained, and also subject him to a forfeiture of one thousand dollars to the party
thereby aggrieved. 2

SEC. 26. Such attachment may be served by the sheriff or
any other person thereto authorized by the judge, who shall also
be empowered to bring up the body of the plaintiff forthwith,
and has for this purpose the same powers as are above conferred
in similar cases.

SEC. 27. The court or oflicer allowing the writ must cause
the prosecuting attorney of the proper county to be informed of
the issuing of the writ and of the time and place where it is
made returnable.

Sec. 28. The defendant in his answer must state plainly

and unequivocably whether he then has, or at any time had the
plaintiff under his control and restraint, and -if so the cause
thereof. 3

SEC. 29. If he holds him by virtue of a legal process or
written authority, a copy thereof must be annexed.

SEC. 30. The plaintiff must demur or reply to the defendant’s answer, and all issues joined thereon shall be tried by
the judge or court.

Sec. 31. Such replication, except when the hearing is before
the judge of the county court may deny the sufficiency of the
testimony to justify the action of the committing magistrate, on
the trial of which issue all written testimony before such magistrate may be given in evidence before the court or judge in
connection with any other testimony which may then be produced. Sac. 32. But it is not permissible to question the correctness
of the action of the grand jury in finding a ‘bill of indictment,
or of the petit jury in the trial of a cause, nor of a court or
judge when actingwithin their legitimate province and in a lawful manner.

SEC. 33. If no sufficient legal cause of detention is shown,
the plaintiff must be discharged.

SEC. 34. Although the commitment of the plaintiff may have
been irregular, still if the court or judge is satisfied from the
evidence before them that he ought to be held to bail or committed either for the offences charged or any other, the order
may be made accordingly. 

SEC. 35. The plaintiff may also in any case be committed,
let to bail, or his bail be mitigated or increased, as justice may
require.

SEC. 36. Until the sufficiency of the cause of restraint is
determined, the defendant may retain the plaintiff in his cus‘tody, and may use all necessary and proper means for that
purpose.

SEC. 37. The plaintiff in writing, or his attorney,may waive
his right to be present at the trial in which case the proceedings
may be had in his absence. The writ will in such cases be modified accordingly.

SEC. 38. Disobedience to any order of discharge subjects the
defendant to attachment for contempt, and also to the forfeiture
of one thousand dollars to the party aggrieved, besides all dainages sustained by him in consequence of such disobedience.

SEC. 39. If the defendant attempt to elude the service of the
writ of habeas corpus, or to avoid the effects thereof by transferring the plaintiff to another, or by concealing him, he shall
on conviction be imprisoned in the penitentiary or county jail
not more than one year, and fined not exceeding one thousand
dollars. And any person knowingly aiding or abetting in any
such act shall be subject to like punishment.

SEC. 40. Any officer refusing to deliver a copy of any legal
process by which he detains the plaintiff in custody, to any person who demands such copy and tenders the fees therefor, shall
forfeit two hundred dollars to‘ the person detained.

SEC. 41. When the roceedings are before a Judge (except
when the writ is refuse ) all the papers in the case, including
his final order, shall be filed with the clerk of the District Court
of the county wherein the final proceedings were had, and a
brief memorandum thereof shall be entered by the clerk upon
his judgment docket.

case as to any communication made by the one to the other

' while married, nor shall they, after the marriage relation

ceases, be permitted to reveal, in testimony, any such communication made while the marriage subsisted.
SEC. 6. No practising attorney, counsellor, physician, surgeon, minister of the gospel, or priest of any denomination,

convictions for a felony. But no other proof of such conviction

writing, is given in evidence by one party, the whole, on the
same subject, may be inquired into by the other: thus, when a
letter is read, all other letters on the same subject between the
same parties may be given. And when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence, any other
act, declaration, or writing, which is necessary to make it fully
understood, or to explain the same, may also be given in evidence.

subscribed as such witness, its execution may be proved by other evidence. .

SEC. 17. Evidence respecting hand-writing may be given
by comparisons made by experts or by the jury with writings of
the same persons, which are proved to be genuine.

SEC. 18. The entries and other writings of a person deceased, made at or near the time of the transaction, and in a
position to know the facts therein stated, are presumptive evidence of such facts, when the entry was made against the interest of the person so making it, or when made in a professional
capacity, or in the ordinary course of professional conduct, or

when made in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by
law.

SEC. 19. Booksof account, containing charges by one party

made at or near the time of the tranasaction therein
entered, unless satisfactory reasons appear for not
making such proof.

believe them just and true, or a suflicient reason must
be given why verification is not made.

either party, and may be sworn upon the trial. But in such a
case it is in his discretion to order the trial to be postponed or

proof of his signature or notarial seal is evidence of the dishonor,
and notice of I bill of exchange ‘or promissory note.

Sec. 23. A subpoena is the proper way of bringing a witness
into court. It must require the witness to be present at a prescribed time and place to give testimony in a case therein

documents, or other writings under his control, and which he is
not excused by law from producing in evidence.

Sec. 24. Witnesses in. civil cases cannot be compelled to

not thus paid, they are not compelled to attend or remain as
witnesses. ‘

sufficient cause or excuse, or for a refusal to testify after appearance, the delinquent is guilty of a contempt of court. He

consequence of such delinquency, together with fifty dollars
additional damages.

SEC. 27. Before a witness is thus liable for a contempt for
not appearing, ‘he must be served personally with the process by
reading to him, and by leaving a copy thereof with him if demanded, and it must be shown, that the fees and traveling expenses allowed by law were tendered to him if required, or it
must appear that a copy of the subpoena, if left at his usual place
of residence, came into his hands, together with the said fees
and traveling expenses above mentioned.

demanded admittance.

suit in his own right, on being duly subpoenaed fail to appear
and give testimony, the other party Inay, at his option, have a
continuance of the cause as in cases of other witnesses, and at
‘the cost of the delinquent.

SEC. 30. Or the party so calling his opponent may, in such
a case, himself become a witnes, or, if he show, by his own testimony, or otherwise, that he could not have a full personal

re-considered during the term of the court, upon satisfactory
reasons being shown for such delinquency.

SEC. 31. The Supreme or District Court may, by rule, require the production of any papers or books which are material
to the just determination of any cause pending before it, for the
purpose of being inspected and copied by or for the party thus

expected to be proved by such books or papers, and that, as the
petioner believes, such books and papers are under the control
of the party against whom the rule is sought, and must show
wherein they are material. The rule shall therefore be‘ granted to produce the books and papers or show cause to the contrary, if the court deem such rule expedient and proper.

SEC. 33. On failing to obey the rule or show suflicient
cause for such failure, the same consequences shall ensue as if
the party had failed to appear and testify, when subpoenaed by
the party now calling for the books and papers.

other produced, the party thus calling for it is not obliged to use

it as evidence in thecase.

affidavit and which may be required for future use in any action
or other proceeding, may be proved by pursuing the course
above indicated as nearly as the circumstances of the case will
admit. \ » _

SEC. 38. Such proof so made may be perpetuated and
preserved for future use by filing the papers above mentioned in
the office of the Judge of Probate, and the original affidavit
appended to the notice or paper if there be one, and if not the
afiidavit by itself, is presumptive evidence of the facts stated
therein, but does not preclude other modes of proof now held
sufiic-ient.

Sec. 39. A copy of the field notes of any county surveyor
or a plat made by him and certified under oath as correct, may

land oflice or; if that be lost or destroyed, or beyond the reach
