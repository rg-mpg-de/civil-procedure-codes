of the
subject
of the action, to such person
as it may direct, and

may,
upon
application
of

and
of

the
service
must
be
upon
him,
and

his
guardian
or
father;
or,
if neither
of
these
can
be
found,
then
upon
his
mother,
or
the
person
having
the
care
or
control

of

the
infant,
or
with
whom
he lives.
If
neither
of
these
can
be found,
or
if the
minor
be more
than
fourteen
years
of
age, service
on him
alone
shall
be sufficient.
The
manner
of

may be
the same
as in the
case of
adults.

ANSWER.
SEC. 91. The
answer
shall
contain,
1. A
general
or specific
denial
of each
material
allega- 
tion
of
the
petition
controverted
by
the
defendant. 
2.
A
statement
of
any
new
matter
constituting
a
defence,
counter-claim
or set-off,
in ordinary
and concise
language
and without
repetition.
§ 92. The
defendant
may
set forth
in
his
answer
as
many
grounds
of defence,
counter-claim
and
set-off
as he
may 
have.
Each must
be
separately
stated
and
numbered,
and
they
must
refer
in
an
intelligible
manner
to
the
cause
of
action
which
they are
intended
to answer.
§ 93. The
counter
claim,
mentioned
in
the last section,
must
be one
existing
in faver
of
a defendant,
and against
a
plaintiff,
between
whom
a
several
judgment
might
be
bad
in the action,
and arising
out of the
contract
or transaction

set

forth
in the petition
as the
foundation
of the
plaintiff's claim, or
connected with the subject
of the action.
§ 94. If
the
defendant
omit
to
set
up
the
counter-claim
or
set-off, he
can not recover
costs against
the plaintiff in
any
subsequent
action thereon;
but this section shall
not apply
to
causes
of
action
which
are
stricken
out
of,
or withdrawn
from
the answer,
as provided
in sections
ninety-five and
one
hundred
and eighteen.
§ 95. When
it
appears
that
a new
party
is
necessary
to
a final
decision upon
the counter-claim,
the court
may either
permit
the
new
party
to
be
made
by
a
summons,
to
reply
to
the
counter-claim, or may
direct the counter-claim
to be
stricken
out of the answer,
and made the subject
of a
separate action.
§ 96. A
set-off
can
only
be
pleaded
in
an
action
founded
on contract,
and
must
be a
cause
of action
arising
upon
contract,
or
ascertained
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
§ 97. When
it
appears
that
a
new
party
is
necessary
to
a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit the
new
party
to
be
made,
if
it
also
appear
that
owing
to
the
insolvency
or
non-residence
of
the
plaintiff,
or
other
cause,
the defendant will be in
danger of losing his claim,
unless
permitted
to use
it as a set-off.
§ 98. When
cross
demands
have
existed
between
persons
under
such
circumstances,
that
if one
had
brought
an
action
against
the other,
a counter-claim
or
set-off could
have
been
set
up,
neither
can
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
thereof,
by the assignment or
death or the other, but
the two demands

must be deemed
compensated, so far as
they equal
each other.
§ 99. The
guardian
of
an
infant
or
person
of
an
unsound
mind, or
attorney for
a person in prison,
shall deny
in the
answer
all material
allegations
of the
petition
prejudicial
to
such defendant.
CHAPTER
V.
REPLY.
SEc. 100. There
shall be no
reply, except
upon the allegation

of a counter-claim or set-off in the answer.
§ 101. When
the
answer
contains

not be required
to the answer
of a guardian
defending
for

of
the
party

thereby.
And
when
the
allegations
of a pleadingare
so indefinite and
uncertain, that the precise
nature of
the charge
or defense is
not apparent,
the court
may require
the pleading
to be made
definite
and certain
by amendment.
§ 118. The court,
at any time before the final
submission
of
the
cause,
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
may
allow
a
COUnter-claim
or set-off,
set up in
the answer,
to be
withdiown,

and

the

subject

of

another
action.

such
counter-claim or set-off
is withdrawn, an action
on the

founded
upon an
account,
promissory
note,
bill
of exchange

payment
of
money
only,
it shall be
sufficient for
the party
to give a copy
of the
account or instrument, with all credits and indorsements
thereon, and
to state that
there is
due to him
on such
account or instrument,
from the adverse party,
a specified
sum, which he

§ 123. In
an action for
a libel or slander,
it shall
be suf-
ficient

the
defamatory
matter
was

and if the allegation
be
denied,
the plaintiff

on the trial,
the facts, showing

that
the
defamatory
matter
was published
or spoken
of
him.

damages,
or
ie
may 
prove either.
§ 125. In an action
for

material
allegation
of
the
petition
not COntroverted
by the answer,
and every
material
allegation
of 
new matter in the answer,
constituting a counter-claim
or 
set-off, not controverted
by the reply,
shall, for the
purposes
of
the action,
be taken as
true; but the
allegation
of new
matter
in
the answer,
not
relating
to a counter-claim
or setoff,

or

of new
matter in reply,
shall be
deemed to be
controverted

by
the

adverse

party,

as

upon
a direct
denial
or
avoidance,
as
the
case
may
require.
Allegations
of
value,
or
of
amount
of
damage,
shall
not
be
considered
as
true,
by failure
to controvert
them.
§ 127. A material
allegation
in a
pleading,
is one
essential

to

the

claim

or

defense,

which

could

not

be

stricken
from
the pleading,
without
leaving it
insufficient.
of

presumptions
of
law,
nor
matters
of which
judicial
notice
is
taken,
need
be stated
in
the
pleading.
§ 129. If an
original
pleading
be
lost,
or withbeld
by
any
pcrsOn, the court
may allow
a copy thereof
to be substi-
tuted.
CHAPTER
VII.
MISTAKES
IN
PLEADING,
AND
AMENDMENTS.
SEC. 130. No variance
between
the
allegation
in
a pleading

and

the

prodf,

is

to

be

deemed
material,
unless
it
have
theaculypry
redi,
actually
misled
the adverse
party to his
prejudice,
in main-
taining
his
action
or
defense
upon
the
merits.
Whenever
it is
alleged, that
a party has
been so misled,
that fact
must
be proved
to the satisfaction of
the court, and it must also
be shown
in what respect he has
been misled; and thereupon
the

court

may order the pleading
to be amended, upon
such
terms as
may be just.
§ 131. When
the
variance
is not
material,
as provided
in
the
last section,
the
court
may
direct
the
fact
to
be
found,
according to the evidence,
and may order an immediate
amendment
without
costs.
§ 132. When,
however,
the allegation
of
the claim
or defense,

to

which

the

proof

is

directed,

is

unproved,

not

in
some particular,
or particulars only, but
in its general scope
and meaning, it is
not to be deemed a
case of variance
within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
§ 133. The plaintiff
may
amend
his petition
without
leave,
at
any
time
before
the
answer
is
filed,
without
proju-
fiepIa
dice to the proceeding; but notice of such amendment shall
be
served
upon
the
defendant,
or
his
attorney,
and
the
defendant

shall have the same time to answer or demur
thereto,
as to
the original
petition.
§ 134. At
any
time
within
ten
days
after
a
demurrer
is
filed, the
adverse party may amend, of
course, on payment
of costs since filing the defective pleading. Notice of
filing an
amended pleading,
shall
be forthwith
served upon
the other party, who
shall have the same time
thereafter to
answer, or reply thereto,
as to an original pleading.
§ 135. Upon
a demurrer being overruled,
the party who
demurred
may
answer
or
reply, if
the court
be
satisfied 
that
he
has
a
meritorious
claim,
or
defense,
and
did
not
de,
mur for
delay.
§ 136. The
court may,
before
judgment,
in furtherance
of
justice,
and
on such
terms
as may
be proper,
amend
any 
pleading, process or proceeding,
by adding or
striking out
the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake
in the
nafne of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect, or by
inserting other allegations material to the
case, or, when
the amendment
does not
change substantially
the
claim or
defense, by conforming
the pleading or proceeding
to the
facts proved. And whenever
any proceeding
taken by a
party fails to conform,
in any respect, to the provisions
of
this code, the court may
permit the same to be
made conformable

thereto,

by
amendment.
§ 137. The
court,
in
every
stage
of an
action,
must
dis-
regard
any
error
or
defect
in
the
pleadings
or
proceedings, 
which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse
party; and no
judgment shall be reversed,
or affected, by
reason
of such error
or defect.
§ 138. If the
demurrer
be sustained,
the
adverse
party
may amend,
if the defect can be
remedied, by way of 
amendment, with, or without costs, as the court in its diS-allowed.
cretion shall direct.
§ 139. When
either
party
shall
amend
any
pleading,
or
proceeding,
and the court
shall be satisfied
by affidavit,
or 
otherwise, that
the adverse party could not
be ready for 
trial in consequence
thereof, a continuance
may be granted
to some day in term, or to another term of the court.
§ 140. When the
plaintiff
shall be
ignorant
of the
name
of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any 
pleading
or proceeding by
any name and description,
and
when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceed
ing may be
amended accordingly.
The plaintiff in such
case must state, in the verification of his petition, that he
could not discover the true name, and the summons must
contain the words,
"real name unknown,"
and a copy
thereof must
be served personally
upon the defendant.
§ 141. Either
party
may
be
allowed
on
notice,
and
Oil 
such
terms
as
to costs,
as the
court
may
prescribe,
to
file
a
supplemental
petition,
answer,
or
reply,
alleging
facts 
material
to
the
case,
occurring
after
the
former
petition,
answer, or reply.
§ 142. Whenever
two or
more
actions
are
pending
in
the
same court,
which
might
have
been
joined,
the
defendant 
may, on motion
and notice to the adverse
party, require
him
to
show
cause
why
the
same
shall
not
be
consolidated,
and if
no such cause
be shown,
the said
several actions
shall
be consolidated.
.joined, 
§ 143. The order
for consolidation
may be
made by the
court,
or
by
a
judge
thereof
in
vacation.

by
the
defendant
himself
or
by
his
bail,
shall discharge the bail; and such surrender may be made
at any time before
the return day of the
summons in an
action against
the bail.
The sheriff shall
give to the bail
a
written acknowledgment of the surrender, and hold the
defendant
in his custody

the action is brought,
on being satisfied that
the bail has
-been given and
adjudged sufficient, shall
direct that the
money deposited be refunded to the defendant, and it must
be refunded
accordingly,
§ 169. If,
at
any
time
before
or
after
judgment
against
the
bail,
proceedings
in
error
are
commenced,
on
the
jud1-inesagainst 
ment against

of the
property
remain- 
ing

hands
of
the
officer,
after
applying
the
moneys
arising from
the sale of perishable
property,
and so
much 
of the
personal
property
and
lands
and
tenements,
if
any,
whether
held
by legal or equitable title,
as may be
neces-
sary
to satisfy the
judgment,
shall be sold
by order of the
court, under
the same restrictions and
regulations, as if the
same
had been levied
on by
execution;
and the money
arising therefrom,
with the amount which
may be recovered
from the garnishee,
shall be applied to
satisfy the judgment
and costs.
If there
be not enough
to satisfy
the same,
the
judgment
shall
stand,
and the
execution
may
issue
thereon,
for the residue
in all respects as in other
cases. Any sur-
plus
of the
attached
property,
or
its
proceeds,
shall
be
returned
to the defendant.
§ 221. The
court may compel
the delivery to
the sheriff, for
sale
of any
of
the
attached
property
for
which
an
undertaking
may have been given, and
may proceed summarily on such
undertaking,

of

the
payment
of
such sum
as may
be
due upon
the
undertaking,

rules

and

attachments
as in
cases
of contempt.
§ 222. The court
may order
the
sheriff to
repossess

for the
purpose of selling it, any
of the attached pro-
perty which may have passed
out of his hands without
having
been
sold or converted
into money;
and
the sheriff.
shall,
under
such order,
have
the same
power
to take
the
property,
as
he would have
under an
order of attachment.
§ 223. If personal
property which
has been attached,
be
claimed
by
any
person
other
than
the
defendant,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
officer
to
have
the
validity
of
such
claim
tried and such proceedings
must be had thereon,
with the
like effect,
as in case
the property
had been
seized upon
execution, and claimed by a third person.
§ 224. Where
several
attachments
are
executed
on
the
same
property,
or
the
same
persons
are
made
garnishees,
the
court,
on
the
motion
of
any
of
the
plaintiffs,
may
order
a reference to ascertain
and report the amounts
and priori-
ties of the several attachments.

do, or is
procuring,
or suffering

accident
or
calamity

jury,
and
the
inquiry 
made whether
it is their verdict.
If any
juror disagrees,
the jury must
be sent out
again; but
if no disagreement
be
expressed,
and

party
requires
the
jury
to be
polled,

Verdict.
§ 274. The
verdict

either
general
or
spe-Theverdictmay
cial.
A
general
verdict
is
that
by
which
they
pronounce, 
generally, upon all or
any of the issues, either
in favor of
the plaintiff
or
defendant.
A
special
verdict
is that
by
which the jury
finds the
facts only.
It must present
Ihe
facts as established
by
the evidence,
and not the
evidence
to prove them;
and they
must be so
presented
as that nothing
remains

to

the court,
but to draw
from them
conclu-
sions of law.
§ 275. In
every
action
for
the
recovery
of
money
only,
or
specific
real
property,
the
jury, in
their discretion,
may 
render
a general or
special verdict.
In all other cases,
thea
court may direct the jury
to find a special verdict
in writing
upon all or any of the
issues; and in all cases may
instruct
them if they
render a general
verdict,
to find upon
particular

questions
of fact to
be stated in
writing, and
may direct
a written finding thereon.
The special verdict
or finding
must be filed with the
clerk and entered on
the journal.
§ 276. When
the special finding
of facts
is inconsistent
with
the general verdict, the former controls
the latter, and
the court may give
judgment accordingly. 
§ 277. When by the verdict
either party is entitled
to
recover
money
of
the
adverse
party,
the
jury
in their
ver- 
dict must assess the amount of recovery.

fact shall
require
the
examination
of mutual
accounts,
or
where the
account
is
on one
side
only,

it
shall
be
made

appear
to
the
-court,

a witness
to prove
the account;
in

the same
manner
as if
the
action
had
been
tried
by

When
the reference
is
to report
the

the referees to sign
any
true exceptions taken to any order or decision by themalgn

consent of 
the
parties,
may
make
any
order
of
reference,
which
the
court, of
which he is
a member, could

I.
JUI)GMENT
IN GENERAL.
SEC.
386.
A
judgment
is
the
final
determination
of the
rights of
the parties
in an action.
§ 387. Judgment
may be given for or
against one or more
of several plaintiffs,
and
for or against
one or moreof
seve-
ral defendants; it may
determine the ultimate rights
of the
parties
on either side, as between
themselves, and
it may
grant to the
defendant
any affirmative
relief to
which he
may
be
entitled.
In
an
action
against
several
defendants,
the
court may,
in its discretion,
render
judgment against
one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against
the
others,
whenever
a several
judgment
may
be
proper.
The court may
also dismiss
the petition
with costs,
in favor
of one
or more
defendants,
in case
of unreasonable
neglect
on
the part of the plaintiff
to serve the summons on
other
defendants, or to proceed in the cause against the defendant,
or

defendants served.
§ 388. An
action
may
be
dismissed
without
prejudice
to a 
future
action.

the case
to
the jury, or to the court, where
the trial is by the court. 
2. By the court, where
the plaintiff fails
to appear on the
trial.
3. By the court for want of necessary parties.
4. By the court, on the application of some of the de-
fendants, where there are others whom the plaintiff fails to
,prosecute with diligence.
5. By the
court, for disobedience
by the plaintiff of
an
order concerning the
proceedings in the action.
In all
other cases, upon the trial
of the action, the decision
must
be upon the merits.
§ 389. In any case
where a
set-off or
counter-claim
has
been presented, the defendant shall have the right of proceeding

to the trial of his claim, although the plaintiff may
have dismissed the action, or failed to appear.
CHAPTER
II.
JUDGMENT UPON FAILURE TO ANSWER.
SEC. 390. If the taking of an account, or the proof of a 
fact,
or the
assessment
of
damages
be
necessary
to
enable 
the
court
to
pronounce
judgment
upon
a
failure
to answer,
or after a decision of an issue
of law, the court may, with 
the
assent
of
the
party
not
in
default,
take
the
account,
hear the proof, or assess the damages; or may, with the
like assent, refer the same to a referee or master commissioner,

or may
direct the same to be ascertained
or assessed
by a jury. If a jury be
ordered, it shall be on
or after the
day on which the action is set for trial.
CHAPTER III.

person
indebted,
or

be
briefly
stated
in
the
judgment, 
other
actions.
or
in
a
writing
to
be
filed
as
pleadings
in
§ 393. Such judgment shall authorize same proceedings
for
its
enforcement,
as
judgments
rendered
in
actions
regu-
larly
brought
and
prosecuted;
and
the
confession
shall
operate as a
release of errors.
§ 394. Every
attorney, who
shall confess judgment
in any
case,
shall,
at
the
time
of
making
such
confession,
produce
shallImkn

a copy of
the warrant
shall
be
filed with
the clerk
of the
court in
which the
judgment
shall be
entered.

by the
person
in custody,
to confess
judgment
in
favor
of the
person

at

whose

suit

he

any

force,
unless
some
attorney
expressly
named
by
the
person
in
custody,
be
present
and

the
warrant
of attorney
as a
witness.
CHAPTER
IV.
MANNER
OF GIVING
AND ENTERING
JUDGMENT.
SEC. 396. When a trial by jury has been had, judgment
must
be
rendered
by the
clerk

special,
or
the
court
order
the
case
to
be
reserved

for
future argument
or consideration.
§ 397. Where
the
verdict
is
special,
or
where
there
has
been
a special
finding
on
particular
questions
of fact,
or
where
the court has ordered the case to be reserved, it shall
order what judgment shall be entered.
§ 398. Where,
upon
the
statements
in
the
pleadings,
one
party
is entitled
by
law to judgment
in his
favor, judgment
shall
be so
rendered
by the
court,
though
a verdict
has
been found against such party.
§ 399. If
a
counter-claim
or
set-off
established
at
the
trial,
exceeds
the
plaintiff's
claim
so
established,
judgment
for the
defendant
must
be
given
for the
excess;
or, if
it
appear
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
any
affirmative
re-
lief, judgment shall be given therefor.,
§ 400. It shall
not
be
necessary
to
reserve
in a judgment
or order,
the right
of an
infant
to show
cause against
it
after
his
attaining
full
age;
but
in
any
case
in
which,
but
for
this section,
such
reservation
would
have
been
proper,
the infant within
one year after arriving
at the age of
twenty-one
years,
may
show
cause
against
such order
or
judgment.
§ 401. All judgments
and orders must
be entered
on the
journal
of the court,
and
specify
clearly the
relief
granted 
or
order
made
in
the
action. 
§ 402. The
clerk shall make a complete
record of every
cause,
as
soon
as
it
is
finally
determined;
unless
such
re- 
cord
or some
part thereof
be
duly waived.
§ 403. He
shall make
up such
record
in each
cause,
in the
vacation
next after
the
tern at
which
the same
was de- 
termined; and the
presiding judge of such
court shall, at
its
next
term
thereafter,
subscribe
the
same. 
§ 404. The records shall be made up from the petition, the
process,
return,
the pleadings
subsequent
thereto,
reports, 
verdicts,
orders, judgments, and
all material acts and proceedings

of

the court; but if the
items of an account
or
the
copies
of a paper
attached
to the pleadings
be volumi-
nous,

entirely. Evidence must
not
be recorded.

lands
of the
judgment

a
writ
of

§ 440. If the
officer,
by virtue
of any writ

issued

court
of
record
in
this
territory,
shall
levy 
the
same
on
any
goods
and
chattels

duty of such
justice
of the
peace, immediately upon the receipt of such notice and
schedule,

make
an
entry
of
the
same
upon
his
docket,
and issue
a writ of summons, directed
to the sheriff, or any
constable of the county,
commanding him to summon
five
disinterested
men,
having
the
qualifications
of
electors,
who
shall
be
named
in
said
summons,
to
appear
before
him,
the
said
justice,
at
the
time
and
place
therein
mentioned,
which time shall not be
more than three days after
the date
of said
writ, to try
and determine
the right
of the claimant
to the property in controversy. And it shall be the duty
of the claimant to give
two days' notice, in writing,
to the
plaintiff
or other
party for
whose benefit
such execution
was issued and
levied as aforesaid,
his agent or attorney,
if within
the county,
of the
time and
place of such
trial;
and he shall,
moreover, prove to the
satisfaction of said
justice that
such notice was given, or
that the same could
not be
given by reason
of the
absence of
the party,
his
agent
or attorney.
§ 441. The
jury
summoned
as
aforesaid,
shall
be
sworn
to try and determine
the right of the
claimant to the pro-
perty in controversy,
and a true verdict
to give, according
to the evidence. If the jury shall find the right to said
goods and chattels, or any part thereof, to be in the claimant,

they

shall also find the
value thereof, and the
justice
shall
render judgment upon
such finding of the jury,
for
the
claimant, that he recover
his c6sts against the plaintiff
in
execution, or other party
to the same, for whose
benefit
the execution issued, and also that he have restitution of
said
goods and
chattels, or
any part thereof,
according
to
the
finding of
the jury. But
if the right
of the said
good;
and
chattels,
and
every part
thereof,
shall
uiot be
in the
claimant
according.
to the
finding of
said jury,
then the
said
justice shall
render judgment
on such
finding,
in favor
of
the plaintiff
in execution,
or other party
for whose
benefit

the

same, was
issued and
levied, against
said
claimant
for
costs,
and
award
execution
thereon.
Said
justice
of
the
peace,
in the taxation
of costs
accruing
by reason
of such
claim
and
trial
shall
allow
each
juror
summoned
and
sworn,
the
sum
of
fifty
cents;
and
for
the
sheriff,
constable,
or
other
officer,
and
witnesses,
and
for
himself,
he
shall
tax
such
fees
as are
allowed
by
law,
to each,
respectively,
for
like
services
rendered
in other
cases.
Such
judgment
for
the
claimant,
(unless
an
undertaking
shall
be
executed,
as
provided
in
the next section)
shall
be
a justification
of
the
officer
in
returning
"no
goods"
to
the
writ
of
execution,
by
virtue
of
which
the
levy
has
been
made,
as
to
such
part
of
the
goods
and
chattels,
as
were
found
to
belong
to
such
claimant.
§ 442. If
the jury shall
find the property
or any
part
thereof
to
be
in
the
claimant,
and
the
plaintiff
in
execution,
shall,
at any
time
within
three
days
after
such
trial,
tender
to
the
sheriff
or
other
officer
having
such
property
in
his
custody
on
execution,
an
undertaking
with
good
and
sufficient

sureties,

payable

to
such
claimant,
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
such
property
as
assessed
by
the
jury, to the effect that they will pay all damages sustained
by
reason
of
the
detention
or
sale
of
such
property,
then
the
sheriff
or
other
officer
shall
deliver
said
undertaking
to
claimant,
and
proceed
to
sell
such
property,
as
if
no
such
trial
of
the
right
of
property
had
taken
place,
and
shall
not
be liable to the
claimant therefor.
§ 443. In
all
cases
where
a
sheriff,
coroner,
or
other
offi-
cer, shall by
virtue of an execution,
levy upon any goods 
and chattels which
shall remain
upon his hands unsold,
for 
.want
of
bidders,
for
the
want
of
time
to
advertise
and
sell,
or any
other
reasonable
cause,
the officer
may
for
his
own
security,
take of
the defendant
an
undertaking
with
security
in such sum as
he may deem
sufficient, to
the effect, that 
the
said
property
shall
be
delivered
to
the
officer
holding
an execution
for the
sale
of the
same,
at the
time
and place
appointed
by said
officer,
either
by notice
given
in writing
to said defendant
in execution,
or by
advertisement,
published

in
a newspaper
printed
in
the county,
naming
therein
the
day
and
place
of .sale.
If the
defendant
shall fail
to deliver
the goods
and chat- 
tels
at
the
time
and
place
mentioned
in
the
notice
to
him
given, or to
pay to the officer
holding
the execution
the full
. value
of said goods
and chattels,
or the
amount of said
debt and
costs, the
undertaking,
given as
aforesaid, shall
be considered
as broken,
and
may be proceeded
on as
in
other cases.
§ 444.
The
officer
who
levies
upon
goods
and
chattels,
by
virtue
of an execution
issued by
a court
of record,
before 
he proceeds
to sell the
same, shall cause
public notice
to be
given
of
the
time
and
place
of
sale,
for
at
least
ten
days 
before the day
of sale. The notice shall
be given by advertisement

published

in

some
newspaper
printed
in the
county,
or in case
no newspaper
be printed
therein,
by setting
up
advertisements
in
five public
places in the
county;
two
advertisements
shall
be put up
in the precinct
where
the
sale
is
to be
held.
And
where
goods
and
chattels
levied 
upon,
can
not
be
sold
for
want
of
bidders,
the
officer
making
such return,
shall
annex
to the
execution
a true
and
perfect

or
if the

or other
officer
shall
be
absent,
or
be
rendered
unable
by
death,
or
other-
wise, to make a deed
of conveyance of the
same, any succeeding

sheriff, or
other officer, on receiving
a certificate
.from the
court from which
the execution
issued
for the sale

a
deed of
conveyance

deed shall
be
as good
and valid
in law,
and
have
the same effect,
as if the
sheriff, or
other officer,
who
made
sale, had executed
the same.
§ 459. If on
any
sale
made
as
aforesaid,
there
shall
be
in
the hands
of
the sheriff
or other
officer,
more

interests
and
costs,

or other
officer
shall,
on
demand, pay the balance to the defendant in execution or

§ 460. If any
judgment
or judgments,
in satisfaction
Of 
which
any
lands
or tenements,
are
sold,
shall
at
any
time
thereafter
be reversed,
such reversal
shall
not defeat
or affect 
the title
of
the
purchaser
or purchasers;
but
in
such
case,
restitution shall be made by the judgment creditor of the
moneys, for which such lands or tenements were sold, with
lawful interest
from the day
of sale.

judgment
heretofore
rendered,
or which
here-
after may be rendered,
on which execution shall
not have 
been
taken
out
and
levied,
before
the
expiration
of
one
year
next
after
its rendition,
shall
operate
as a
lien on
the
estate of any debtor,
to the prejudice of any
other bona fide
judgment creditor.
But in all cases, where
judgment has
been or may be rendered
in the supreme court,
and a special
mandate
awarded to
the district
court to carry
the same
into execution,
the lien
of the judgment
creditor
shall con-
tinue
for one
year after
the first day
of the term
of the
district
court
to which such
mandate
may be
directed.
Nothing
in
this subject
contained,
shall
be construed
to
defeat
the
lien of
a judgment
creditor,
who shall
fail to
take
out execution
and
cause
a levy
to
be made
as
herein
provided,
when
such
failure
shall
be
occasioned
by appeal,
proceedings
in error,
injunction,
or by a
vacancy
in the
office
of sheriff
and
coroner,
or the
inability
of such
officer,
until one
year
after such
disability
shall be
removed.
In
all cases,
where

estate
has
been
or may
hereafter
be 
taken
on
execution
and
appraised,
and
twice
advertised
and
offered
for sale,
and
shall remain
unsold
for want
of bidders,

aside
such
appraisement,

and

to
convict
him
of
a
fraud,
but his answer
shall not
be used as
evidence against
him in
a prosecution
for such fraud.

cause
shown,
it may
suspend
any
execution
made
returna-
ble before
it by
order
of
the
supreme
court,

the
same
manner
as

or
other

against
several
parties,

the
first section
of
this chapter, 
that
the defendant
either denies
the plaintiff's
right
or did
some
act amounting
to such
denial.
§ 569. In an action
for the recovery of real
property,
where
the plaintiff
shows
a right
to
recover
at the time
the 
action
was
commenced,
but
it
appears
that
his
right
has
terminated
during
the pendency
of the
action, the
verdict
and judgment
must
be according
to the fact,
and
the plaintiff

may
recover
for
withholding
the property.
§ 570. In
an action for
the recovery
of real property,
the
party

occupying
claimants
of land.

have resulted from such waste, to the person who is entitled
to sue therefor.
§ 574. Judgment
of
forfeiture
and conviction
may be
rendered
against
the
defendant,
whenever
the
amount
of
damages so recovered,
is more than two-thirds
the value of
the interest such defendarit has in the property wasted, and
when the action is brought
by the person entitled
to the
ieversion.
§ 575. Any person whose
duty it is to prevent
waste, and
who has not used reasonable
care and diligence
to prevent
it, is deemed to have committed it.
§ 576. For
willful.trespass,

timber, tree,
or
shrub
on the
land of
another,
or
in the
street
or highway
in
front of another's
cultivated
ground, yard,
or town lot,
or
on the public
grounds of
any town, or
any land held
by this'
territory for any
purpose whatever,
the trespasser
shall pay
treble damages
at the
suit of any
person entitled
to pro-
tect
or enjoy
the
property
aforesaid.
§ 577. Nothing
herein
contained
authorizes
the recovery
of
more than
the just
value
of the
timber
taken from
uncultivated

wood
land for
the repair
of a public highway
or
bridge, upon
the land
in its immediate
neighborhood.
§ 578. The
owner
of
an
estate
in
remainder
or
reversion,
may

either
of the aforesaid
actions
for
injuries

the
inheritance,
notwithstanding
any
intervening
estate
for
life
or
years.

heir,
whether
a
minor
or

tors as well
as in his own
time, unless
barred by
the statute
of limitations.
§ 580. Where
lands
or-tenements
are
sold
by
virtue
of
an
execution,
the purchaser
at such
sale
may maintain
his
action against
any person, for either
of the causes above
mentioned,
occurring
or existing
after his
purchase.
§ 581. This provision is not
intended to prevent the
per-
o son who
occupies
the
lands,
in the
mean
time,
from using
them in
the ordinary course of
husbandry, or for using
timber
for
the purpose
of making
suitable
repairs
thereon.
§ 582. But
if
for this
purpose
he employ
timber
vastly

he will
be deemed
to have committed
waste,
and will
be liable accordingly.

ACTIONS
ON
OFFICIAL
SECURITIES.
SEC. 583. When
an
officer,
executor
or
administrator
within
this
territory,
by
misconduct
or
neglect
of
duty, 
forfeits
his bond or
renders his
sureties liable,
any person
injured
thereby, or
who is by law
entitled to
the benefit
of
the
security,
may
bring
an
action
thereon,
in
his
own
name,
against
the officer, executor
or administrator, and his
sureties,

to

recover

the

amount

to

which

he

may

be

entitled

by
reason
of
the
delinquency.
The
action
may
be
instituted
and
proceeded in on a certified
copy of the bond,
which
copy shall
be furnished
by the
person holding
the original
thereof.
§ 584. A
judgment
in
favor
of a party
for
one
delinquency, 
does
not preclude
the same
or another
party from an
action
on the
same security
for
another
delinquency.
CHAPTER
III.
ACTIONS
FOR
THE PARTITION
OF REAL
PROPERTY.
SEC.
585. The
provisions
of the
existing statutes
relating 
to
the
partition
of
lands,
tenements
and
hereditam'ents,
are 
not affected
by
this code,
and
partition
may be
made
under
the
same,
as heretofore,
until
the
legislature
shall
otherwise
provide. The
provisions
of such statutes,
shall
also apply
to actions
for such
partition
brought
under
this
act, so far
*as
the same
can be
so applied
to the
substance
and
subject
matter
of the
action
without
regard
to its
form.
CHAPTER IV.
PROCEEDINGS
UPON
MANDAMUS.
SEC.
586.
The
writ
of mandamus
may
be
issued
to
anyTowhom
inferior
tribunal,
corporation,
board
or
person,
to
compel 
the performance
of
an act, which
the law specially
enjoins
as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station. But
though it may
require'an
inferior tribunal
to exercise
its
judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions,

it can not control judicial discretion.
§ 587. This
writ
may
not
be
issued
in
any
case,
where
there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of the
law. It may issue on the
information of the
party benefically
interested.
§ 588. The
writ is either
alternative
or peremptory.
The
alternative
writ
must
state
concisely
the
facts
showing
the
obligation
of
the
defendant
to
perform
the
act,
and.his
omission

to
perform

it,
and command
him, that
immediately
upon
the receipt of the writ,
or at some other specified
time, he
do the act required to
be performed, or show cause
before
the
court whence
the writ issued,
at a
specified time
and
place, why
he has not done
so; and
that he, then
anDd there
return the writ,
with his
certificate
of having done
as he is
commanded.
The peremptory
writ
must be in
a similar
form, except
that the words
requiring
the defendant
to show
cause
why
he has not
done
as commanded,
must
be omitted.
§ 589. When
the
right
to
require
the
performance
of
the
act is clear, -and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be
given for not performing
it, a peremptory mandamus
may be
allowed
in
the first
instance.
In all
other
cases, the
alter-
native
writ
must
be first
issued.
§ 590. The
motion,
for
the
writ
must
be
made
upon
affidavit,

and

the court
may require
a notice of
the application
to
be given
to the
adverse party,
or may grant
an order
to
show cause why it should
not be allowed, or may
grant the
writ without notice.
§ 591. The allowance
of the
writ must
be
indorsed
thereon,

signed

by

a
judge

of
the

court

granting

it,

and

the

writ
must be served personally upon the defendant. If the defendant

duly served neglect to return the same, he shall be
proceeded against, as for a contempt.
§ 592. On
the return
day of
the
alternative
writ,
or
such
further day, as the court may allow, the party on whom
the writ shall have been served, may show cause, by answer

made, in the same manner as an answer to a petition
in a civil action.
§ 593. If
no
answer
be
made,
a peremptory
mandamus
must
be
allowed against the defendant.
If an answer be made
containing
new
matter,
the
same
shall
not
in
any
respect,
conclude the plaintiff, who may on the trial or other proceeding,

avail

himself of any
valid objection to its
suffici-
ency, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct denial
or by way
of avoidance.
§ 594. No
other
pleading
or written
allegation
is
allowed,

than

the

writ

and

answer.

These

are

the

pleadings

in
the case, and
have the
same effect
and are to be
construed
and may be amended
in the
same manner, as
pleadings
in
a civil
action;
and
the
issues
thereby
joined
must
be
tried,
and
the
further
proceedings
thereon
had
in the
same
man-
ner, as in
a civil action.
§ 595. If judgment be given for
the plaintiff, he shall re- 
cover
the
damages
which
he
shall
have
sustained,
to
be
as-
certained
by the
court,
or a
jury,
or by
referees,
in
a civil
action,
and
costs;
and
a peremptory
mandamus
shall
alo
be granted
to him
without
delay.
§ 596. A recovery of damages by virtue of this chapter,
against
a party, who shall
have made a return to a
writ of
mandamus,
is
a bar to any
other action
against the
same
party for the making of such return.
§ 597. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed to
any
public
officer,
body
or
board,
commanding
the
perform-maybeinposed.
ance
of
any public
duty,
specially
enjoined
by
law, if it
appear
to the
court, that
such
officer, or
any member
of
such
body
or board,
has, without
just excuse,
refused or
neglected

to perform
the duty
so enjoined,
the court may
impose
a
fine not exceeding
five hundred dollars,
upon every such
officer, or
member of
such body or
board. Such
fine, when
collected,
shall
be
paid
into
the
treasury
of
the
county,
where the
duty ought to have been
performed; and the payment

thereof

is
a bar to an action
for any
penalty incurred
by such officer,
or member
of such
body or board,
by reason
of hM refusal
or
neglect to
perform
the duty
so enjoined.
