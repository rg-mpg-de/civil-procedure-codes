items of an account therein alleged; but unless he file a veri­ 
tied copy thereof with such pleadings, and serve the same on
the adverse party, he shall, within ten days after a demand
thereof, in writing, deliver to the adverse party a copy of such
Instrument of writing, or the items of an account, verified by
his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect that
he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence
thereof. 'I'hc court, or a judge thereof, may order a further ac­
count, when the one delivered is defective; and the court may,
in all cases, order a bill of particulars of the claim of either
party to be furnished. . 
SEC. 69. In the consrruction of a pleading, for the
purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liber- 
ally construed, with a view to substantiate justice between the
parties. 
Sec. 70. If irrelevant or redundant matter be in­
serted in a pleading it may be stricken out on motion ol any
person aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations of a plead· 
ing are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the
charge or defense is not apparent, the court may require the
pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment, or
may dismiss the same. 
Sec. 71. In pleading a judgment or other determina­
tion of a court or office of special jurisdiction, it shall not be
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such
judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly 
given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party
pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial the facts con·
ferring jurisdiction. 
Sec. 72. In pleading the performance of conditions
precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts showing such performance, but it may be stated general­ 
ly that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part;
and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall
be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such
performance. 
Sec. 73. In pleading a private statute, or a right de­
rived therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute 
by its title, and the day of its passage, and the court shall
thereupon take judicial notice thereof. 
Sec. 74. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not
be necessary to state in the complaint any intrinsic facts, for
the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the
defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose, but
it shall be sufficient to state generally, that the same was pub­
lished or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allega­
tion be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish
on trial that it was so published or spoken. 
Sec. 75. In the actions mentioned. in the last section,
the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of

cumstances to reduce the amount of damages; and whether he
prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the mit­
igating circumstances. 
Sec. 76. In an action to recover the possession of
property distrained doing damage, an answer that the defand­
ant or person by whose command he acted, was la wf ully pos­
sessed of the real property upon which the distress was made. 
and that the property distrained was at the time doing the 
damage thereon, shall be good, without setting forth the title
to such real property. 
Sec. 77. The plaintiff may unite all the causes of action
which he may have in the same complaint, but the causes of
action so united must affect all the parties to the action and
not require different places of trial, and must be separately
stated: Provided, That where two or more persons are or
claim to be interested in the subject matter of the suit wheth­
er adversely to the plaintiff or each other, or in any other man­
ner, they may all be made either parties plaintiff or defendant
as the case shall require and their respective rights be deter­ 
mined.
Sec. 78. A material allegation in a pleading is one 
essential to the claim or defense, and which could not be
stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient. 
Sec. 79. No variance between the allegation in a
pleading and the proof shall be deemed material, unless it 
have actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice
in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. When­
ever it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that
fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in 
what respect he has been misled, and, thereupon, the court
may order the pleading to be amended upon such terms as
shall be just. 
Sec. 80. When the variance is not material, as pro­
vided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to 
be found according to the evidence, or may order an imme­
diate amendment without costs. 
Sec. 81. When. however. the allegation of the cause
of action or defense, to which the proof is directed, is not
proved, not in some particular or particu tars only, but in its
entire scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of var­
iance within the last two sections. but a foilure of proof. 
Sec. 82. Where the plaintiff in action to recov­
er the possession of personal property on 11 claim of being the
owner thereof, shall fail to establish on the trial such owner­
ship, but shall prove that he is entitled to the possession there­
of, by virtue of a special property therein, he shall not thereby
be defeated of his action. but shall be permitted to amend, on
reasonable terms his complaint. and he =ntltled to iudgment. 
according to the proof in the case. 

Sec. 83. At any time before judgment, the court, on 
motion, may authorize any of the pleadings to be amended on
such terms as shall be deemed reasonable; and at any tune
before the close of the next term of the court, after the term
in which any judgment, order or other proceeding, is had, the
court, on motion, and upon good cause shown, after reason­
able notice to the adverse party, or his attorney, may relieve
a party from such judgment, order, or proceeding taken
against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect, and supply an omission in any proceedings. 
SEC. 84. When the pla int itf shall be- iguorunr or trre 
nauu- of t lu- defr-ndunt , it shall l>t> so stnr--d i11 tlu- pleading, 
and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or pro­
ceeding by any name, and when his true name shall be discov­
ered. the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordiuuly. 
SEC. 85. the court sha II, iu <'\'<•t·y i-;t ,t:.r<' of an action,

motion. And where it appears in the complaint at the com­
mencement of the action, or during the pendency thereof,

jury may be discharged, and a new jury, then or ·afterwards,
impanneled. 
Sec. 208. When the evidence is completed the plaintiff or
party having the burden of proof, may, by himself, or counsel,
address the court and jury upon the law and facts of thP case;
after which the other party may address the court and jury
in like manner, and be followed by the party first addressing
the court, by himself or one counsel. The court shall then

verdict be in favor of the plaintiff, or if they find in favor of the
defendant and that he is entitled to a return thereof, and may

sustained by reason of the detention or taking and withhold­
ing such property.

only, or specific real property, the jury, in their dlscretlon,

them, if they render a general verdict, to find upon particu­
lar questions of facts, to be stated in writing, and may direct
a written finding thereon. The special verdict or finding
shall be filed with the clerk and entered on the minutes. 
Sec. 217. When a special finding of facts shall be
inconsistent with the general verdict, the former shall con­ 
trol the latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.
Sec. 218. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff 
in an action for the recovery of money, or for the defendant

judgment for the plaintiff on the answer.

these lots? If there is a bidder, he shall then inquire: 
2d.-Who will pay the debt for a seven years' lease of
any less number of lots than the whole? If there is a bidder,
he shall inquire in respect to the smallest number of lots, for
a lease of which any bidder is willing to pay the debt.

iod of time'? If other lands, and divided into tracts or parcels,
he shall make similar inquiries concerning the whole and the
several parcels. and the separate acres in each parcel, If a
single tract of land, he shall make similar inquiry concerning
the whole, and the number of acres. If there is no bidder who
is willing to pay the debt for such lease of the whole, or of any
part known as separate lots. parcels or acres, he shall then
inquire who will pay the debt for the whole, or any known
part, in lots. parcels or acres, as the case may require. If 
he shall have a bidder he shall then offer for sale to the high­
est bidder above the debt. the lowest number of lots, or par­
cels, or acres. for which any one is willing to pay the debt. If 
he has no bid for the whole. or any portion equal to the
amount of the debt, he shall then off Pr the land for sale. the

most advantageous. All land, efflcept town lots, shall be sold 
bv the acre.

other form; in such case, if such request is reasonable. the 
officer making the sale shall sell accordingly.
Sec. 301. When an entire tract or parcel Is sold 
by the acre it shall not be measured but shall be
deemed and taken to contain the number of acres named In 
the description, and be paid for accordingly; and when the
number of acres is not contained in the description, the •Jfflcer
shall declare according to his judgment how many acres are
contained therein, which shall be deemed and taken to be the
true number of acres. 
Sec. 302. The officer shall strike off the land to the
highest bidder, who shall forthwith pay the money bid to the 
officer, who shall return the money with his execution and bis ·
doings thereon, to the clerk of the court from which the ex­
ecution issued, according to the order thereof. 
Sec. 303. Upon the return. of any sale of real estate
as aforesaid, the clerk shall enter the cause on which the ex­ 
ecution issued, by its title, in the docket of the term next atter

firmation," and if no objection is made, the court, at such
term, shall confirm such sale, and order the officer to make
out and deliver to the purchaser a deed or rPlease of the land ·
sold, as the ease may require. If the court shall be satisfied
that by any irregularity of the officer, or from any cause, in­
justice has been done, the court shall set aside the sale or

property, to the effect that it shall be delivered to the sheriff
at the time and place of sale, and for non-delivery thereof, an
action may be maintained upon such bond by the sheriff or 
the plaintiff in the execution.
SEC. 306. If, at the time appointed for the sale, the sheriff 
should be prevented from attending at the place appointed,
or, being present, should deem it for the advantage of all con­
cerned, to postpone the sale for want of purchasers, or other
sufficient causes, he may postpone the sale, not exceeding one 
week next after the day appointed, and so from time to time
for like causes, giving notice of every adjournment by public
proclamation, made at the same time, not exceeding the life
of the execution. ·

or contract of one of them as securltv for another, and the
surety pays the amount, or any part ·thereof. either bv sale
of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from
the principal. In such cases, the person so paving or con­
tributing, shall be entitled to the benefit of the judgment to
enforce contribution or repayment, if within thirty days after
his payment, he fl.le with the clerk of the court where the
judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to

thereof as may be allowed for going to and returning from the
place where the court is held, if such fees for attendance and
mileage, or such compensation, be demanded by him at the
time notice is served upon him . 
Sec. 333. The notice may require not only the
personal attendance of the person to whom it is directed, at
a particular time and place, to testify as a witness, but may
also require him to bring with him any books, documents or
things under his control; but no public officer or person having
the possession or control of public records or papers which 
by law are required to be kept in any particular office or Jll~ce,

moval and production before a court or officer, for the purpose
of being orally examined, may be issued. 
Sec. 340. Such order can only be made upon affida­
vit, showing the nature of the action or proceeding, the testi­ 
mony expected from the witness. and its materiality.
Sec. 341. Every person shall be entitled to one day's fees 
for attendance as witness in any case in which he shall have
been actually sworn and given testimony, but no person shall
be entitled to any greater amount of fees in any case, unless

trial, or he may be examined on a commission. 
Sec. 343. Instead of the examination being had at
the trial, as provided by the last section, the plaintiff, at the 
time of filing his complaint or afterwards, and the defendant
at the time of filing his answer or afterwards, may file in the

documents material to the support or defense of the action, to
be answered on oath by the adverse party. 
Sec. 344. Such interrogatories shall be answered,
and such answers fl.led in the clerk's office, within twenty

any interrogatories filed, his complaint, answer, or reply may
be stricken out, and judgment taken against him, and he may
also, in the discretion of the court, be proceeded against as
in other cases for contempt: Provided, That the preced- 
ing sections shall not be construed so as to compel any per·
son to answer any question where such answer may tend to
criminate himself. 
Sec. 348. A party examined by an adverse. party, as in
this act provided, may be examined on his own behalf in re­
spect to any matter pertinent to the issue. But if he testify
to any new matter, not responsive to the inquiries put to him

answer thereto, or to discharge when his answer would charge
himself. such adverse party may offer himself as a witness on
his own behalf, in respect to such new matter, and shall be 
received.
Sec. 349. A person for whose immediate benefit the action 
is prosecuted or defended, though not a party to the action,

amination, no objection to the form of an interrogatory shall
be made at the trial, unless the same was taken at the time of
the examination. · It shall be the duty of the person taking'
the deposition to propound to the witness every question pro­
posed by either party, and to note all objections to the form
of any interrogatory, and when any interrogatory is objected
to on account of form, unless the form is amended and the ob­
jection waived, he shall write after the question and before
the answer the words "objected to," and when any witness
declines to answer a question on the ground that it will tend
to criminate himself, that fact shall also be noted after the
question is written down. The deposition may be taken in the
form of a narrative, or by question and answer, or partly in
either form, as either party present at the examination shall ·
require. When taken by question and answer, the officer shall
first write down the question and then the answer, as nearly
as may be in the language of the witness; but when the depo­
sition is read to the witness previous to sign 1 n ~ it, he shall
be permitted to amend his answer to any qu.:«: ;. -1 or any part
of his deposition; such amendment, howc. er, unless both 
parties shall otherwise agree, shall not be made by way of

discontinue it, or when it shall be dismissed for any cause. and
another action shall afterwards be commenced for the same

be used in the other, in the same manner and subject to the
same conditions and objections as if originally taken for such
other action: Provided. That the deposition shall have been
duly fl.led in the court where the first action was pending, and
shall remain in the custody of the court, from the termination
of the first action until the commencement of the other.

pealed from one court to another, all depositions lawfully

in writing to such depositions in the court below.

the said first day of the supreme court. But, if the party en­ 
.titled to such writ, shall be absent from the Territory, and
shall not have been personally served with process, nor ap­
peared to the action. or if such party be un infant, married

shall file with the clerk of the court, in which the judgment
was rendered, a precipe, containing a particular description

record, m any county m the Territory. And if service of the
notice cannot be had from any cause, the court, at such term,
apon being satisfied that the precipe has been filed and notice
issued, may direct the manner in which such notice may be
given; and after the order for giving notice has been fully
complied with, may proceed as though notice had actually been
given. 
Sec. 380. Upon the filing of such precipe, the plaintiff in

record shall not be received by the clerk of the supreme court,
or shall be lost, the court shall order a new transcript to be 
sent up in such time and manner as they shall see flt: Pro·
vided, 'I'hat in all cases where the failure arises from the ne­
glect of tile plaintiff in error to comply with the provisions
~f this act, the writ of error or appeal shall be dhtmi~,ecl.
Either party may upon a suggestion of a diminution of the 
record, and upon a proper case made, have an order that a
further record be sent up. 
Sec. 383. If the notice shall have been served ten days Ol" 
more before the term of the court to which the record is re­
turnable, the case shall stand for trial at such term; and it
may stand for trial if the parties appear in court, bringing in
the record, and waive the notice. 
Sec. 384. The court of error may fix the time for assign·
ing errors and filing joinders; if errors in law be assigned, no
joinder shall be necessary. One or more errors in fact may
be assigned, and the defendant may put in the common joinder
as a demurrer thereto, or may traverse or confess, and avoid
the fact assigned for error, and a separate issue shall be made 
on each.
Sec. 385. If at the time of filing the precipe with the clerk 
or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff in error shall file with
the clerk a bond with sureties to the satisfaction of the clerk,
in double the amount of the judgment, if it is for money, and
if the judgment is for the restraining or performing any
other acr, or the determination of any other right, then in
such a sum as a judge of the supreme court shall direct, con­
ditioned that the plaintiff pay all costs and damages, and per­
form such judgment as the court on the trial of the writ of
error shall adjudge against him, then no further execution
shall be had upon the original judgment until the determina­
tion of the writ of error, and any execution previously issued
shall be recalled. 
SEC. 386. The judgment or other matter complained of,
may be affirmed or may be reversed or set aside in whole or
in part, or may be modified, or a different order or judgment

-or may be dismissed by the plaintiff in error or by the court,
and the cause be remitted to the district court for such fur­

devise or bequest, subject to the same remedies on such bond,
covenant, or agreement; for specific performance, or other­
wise against devisees or legatees, as might be had by law

gard such child or children or their descendants, not pro­
vided for, shall be deemed to die intestate, and such child or
children or their descendants, shall be entitled to such pro­

proportional part.

tors from being competent witnesses to his will.

vise, legacy or gift may have been made or given, would
have been entitled to any share in the testator's estate, in
case the will is not established, then so much of the estate as

witness, shall be saved to him, as will not exceed the value

Sec. 73. When any devisees, legatees or heirs shall
be required to refund any part of the estate received by them,
for the purpose of making up the share, devise or legacy of
any other devisee, legatee or heir, the probate court, upon the

of such estate, may order the same to be made, and enforce

and so much other property as may be necessary to be sold, to 
pay the allowance made to the family of the deceased.
SEC. 213. If claims against the : estate have been 
allowed, and a sale of property shall be necessary for 'the pay­
ment of the expenses of the administration, he may also apply

tion of the probate court, that it will be for the interest of the
estate to allow the executor or administrator to sell some or
the whole of the personal estate at private sale, the court

Sec. 217. When the personal estate in the hands
of the executor or administrator shall be insufficient to pay
the allowance to the family, and all the debts and charges of
the administration, the executer or administrator may sell the
real estate for that purpose, upon the order of the probate 
.court. To obtain such order he shall present a petition to the
court, setting forth the amount of the personal estate that has 
come to his hands, and how much, if any, remains undisposed
of, a list and the amounts of the debts outstanding against
the deceased, as far as the same can be ascertained, a descrip­
tion of all the real estate of which the testator or intestate died
seized, the condition and value of the respective lots and por­
tions, the names and ages of the devisees, if any, and of' the
heirs of the deceased, which petition shall be verified by the
oath of the party presenting the same.

there is not sufficient personal estate in the hands of the ex­
ecutor or administrator to pay the allowance to the family,
the debts outstanding against the deceased, and the expenses
of administration, and that it is necessary to sell the whole or
some portion of the real estate, for the payment of such debts,
the probate court shall thereupon make an order, directing all 
persons interested to appear at a time and place specified, not
less than four nor more than eight weeks from the time of 
making such order, to show cause why an order shall not be
granted to the executor or administrator to sell the real estate
of the deceased, or so much thereof as shall be necessary, to 
pay such allowances, charges and debts.

in writing, to such sale, of all parties interested, shall proceed
to the hearing of such petition; and if auch consent be not
flied, shall hear and examine the allegation and proofs of the
petitioners and of all persons interested in the estate, who may
oppose the application. 
SEC. 221. If any of· the devisees or heirs of the de­
ceased are minors, and have a general guardian in the county, 
the copy of the order shall be served on the guardian. If they
have no such guardian, the court shall, before proceeding to
act on the petition, appoint some disinterested person their
guardian for the sole purpose of appearing, for them and tak-: 
ing care of their interests in the proceedings.

SEC. 223. If it shall appear to the court that i,t is
necessary to sell a part of the real estate, and that by a sale
of such part the residue of the estate or some specific part or
piece thereof would be greatly injured, the court may author­
ize the sale of the whole estate, or of such part thereof as may
be adjudged necessary, and most for the interest of all con­
cerned. 
Sec. 224. If the probate court shall be satisfied
after a full hearing upon the petition, and on examination of
the proofs and allegations of the parties interested. that a sale
of the whole or some portion of the real estate is necessary 
for the payment of the allowance to the family, and all valid
claims against the estate and charges of administration, or
if such sale be assented to by all the persons interested, he
shall make an order of sale authorizing the executor or admin­ 
istrator to sell the whole or so much and such parts of the
real estate described in . the petition as he shall judge neces-
sary or beneficial. · 
Sec. 225. The order shall specify the lands to be
sold and the terms of sale, which may be either for cash or on
credit, and not exceeding six months, as the court may direct.

and not charged in such devise with the payment of debts,
the court shall order that part descended to heirs to be sold,
before that so devised. 
Sec. 226. lf the executor or administrator shall
neglect to apply for an order of sale whenever it may be nec­
essary, any person interested in the estate may make appli­
cation therefor in the same manner as an executor or admin­
istrator, and notice thereof shall be given to the executor or
administrator before the hearing. 
Sec. 227. Upon making such order, the clerk of
the probate court shall deliver 'it to the executor or adminis­
trator, who shall thereupon be authorized to sell the real estate
as directed. ·

time and place of sale shall be posted in ten of the most pub­
lic places in the county where the land is situated, at least
twenty days before the day of sale, and shall be published in
some newspaper in this Territory, in general circulation in
said county, for three successive weeks next before such. sale,
in which notice the lands and tenements shall be described 
with common certainty.
Sec. 229. Such sale shall be in the countv where 
the lands are situated at public auction, between the hours
of ten o'clock in the morning and the setting of the sun the
same day; but if the executor or administrator shall deem it
for the interest of all concerned that the sale should be post­
poned, he may adjourn it for any time not exceeding fourteen 
days.
Sec. 230. In case of such adjournment notice 
thereof shall be given by a public proclamation at the.time and
place first appointed for the sale; and il the adjournment shall
be for more than one day, further notice shall be given by post­
ing or publishing as the time and circumstances may admit.

any sale of real estate shall, at the next term of the court
thereafter, make a return of his proceedings to the probate
court, who shall examine the same, and if he shall be of opin­
ion that the proceedings were unfair, or that the sum bidden
is disproportionate to the value, and that a sum exceeding such
bid at least ten per cent., exclusive of expense of a new sale,
may be obtained, be shall vacate such sale and order another
to be had, of which notice shall be given, and the sale shall be
conducted in all respects as if no previous sale had taken
place.

was legally made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid­
den was not disproportionate to the value of the property sold,
or if disproportionate, that a greater sum as above specified,
cannot be obtained, the court shall make an order confirming
the sale and directing conveyances to be executed; and such
sale, from that time, shall be confirmed and valid. 
Sec. 235. Such con,veyances shall thereupon be executed
to the purchaser by the; executor or administrator. They shall 
contain and set forth at large the original order authorizing a
sale, and the order confirming the sale and directing the con­
veyances; and they shall be 'deemed to convey all the estate,
rights and interest of the testator or intestate at the time of
his death. 
Sec. 236. Before any order is entered confirming
the sale, it shall be proven to the satisfaction of the probate

Sec. 237. When a testator shall have given any
legacy by will that is effectual to charge real estate, and his
goods, chattels, rights and credits shall be insufficient to pay
such legacy, together with his debts and charges of adminis­
tration, the executor or administrator, with the will annexed,
may obtain an order to sell his real estate for that purpose in
the same manner and upon the same terms and conditions as
are prescribed in this act, in case of a sale for the payment of
debts. 
Sec. 238. If the testator shall make provision by 
his will, or design-ate the estate to be appropriated for the pay­
ment of his debts, the expenses of administration, or family

the sale in all respects as if he were under the order of the
court, unless there are special directions given in the will, in
which case he shall be governed by such directions; but in all
cases he shall make return of the sale to the probate court,
who shall vacate such sale unless the same shall appear in all
respects to be made according to law in like manner as upon
sales made by administrators. 
Sec. 240. If the provisions made by the will or- the
estate appropriated be not sufflclent to pay the debts and ex­
penses of administration and family expenses, such part of

provisions of this act. 
Sec. 241. The estate, real and personal, given by

the several liabilities and decree how much each person shall
contribute. 
Sec. 243. If a deceased person at the time of his
death was possessed of a contract for the purchase of lands, his

application of his executor or administrator, in the same man­
ner as if he had died seized of such lands; and the same pro­
ceedings may be had for that purpose as are prescribed in this 
act, in respect to lands of which he died seized, except as here·
inafter provided. .

and indemnity of the persons entitled' to the interest of the
deceased in lands so contracted for, in double the whole amount
of the payments thereafter to become due on such contract,
with such securities as the probate court shall approve.

of any covenant or agreement contained in such contract; but
if there be no payments thereafter to become due on such
contract, no bond shall be required of the purchaser,

executor or administrator shall execute to the purchaser an
assignment of the contract, which assignment shall vest in the
purchaser, his heirs and assigns, all the right, title and interest
of the persons entitled to the interest of the deceased in the
land sold at the time of the sale: and such purchaser shall ·
have the same rights and remedies against the vendor of such
lands as the deceased would have had if living. 
SEC. 247. If any person die, having mortga~ed
any real or personal estate, and shall not have devised the
same or provided for the redemption thereof by will, the pro·
bate court, upon the application· of any person interested, may 
order the executor or administrator to redeem the estate out of
the personal assets, if it should appear to the satisfaction of
the court that such redemption would be beneficial to the
estate and not injurious to creditors. 
Sec. 248. If such redemption be not deemed expe­
dient, the court shall order such property to be sold at public
sale, which sale shall be with the same notice, and conducted
in the same manner as is required in other cases of real estate
provided for in this act, and the executor or administrator
shall execute a conveyance · thereof to the pur­
chaser; which conveyance shall be effectual to convey to the
purchaser all the right, title and interest which the deceased
would have had in the property had not the same been mort­
gaged by him, and the purchase money, after paying the ex- 
penses of the sale, shall first be applied to the payment and
discharge of such mortgage, and the residue in due course of
administration. 
Sec. 249. If there shall be any neglect or miscon­
duct in the proceedings of the executor or administrator in
relation to any sale, by which any person interested in the
estate shall suffer damages, the party aggrieved may recover
the same in a suit upon the bond of the executor or adminis­
trator, or otherwise, as the case may require. 
Sec. 250. Any executor or administrator who shall
fraudulently sell any real estate of his testator or intestate,
contrary to the provisions of this act, shall be liable in double
the value of the land sold, as damages, to be recovered in an
action by the person or persons having an estate of inheritance
therein. 
Sec. 251. No action for the recovery of any estate, sold
oy any executor under the provisions of this act, shall be
maintained by any person claiming under the deceased testa­
tor or intestate, .unless it be commenced within three years 
next after the sale.
Sec. 252. The preceding section ·shall not apply to min­ 
"rs, or others under any legal disability to sue at the time
when the right of action shall first accrue, but all such- per­ 
sons may commence such action at any time within three
years after the removal of the disability. 
Sec. 253. Whenever a sale shall have been made by an
executor or administrator, of any property of the estate, real 
or personal, it shall be his duty to return to the· probate court,
at its next term thereafter, an account of sales, verified by his

Sec. 257. Executors and administrators may main ..
tain actions against any person who shall have wasted, de­

Sec. 259. Any administrator may in his own name,
for the use and befient of all parties interested in the estate,

administrator of the same estate. 
Sec. 260. Whenever a debtor of a deceased person
shall be unable to pay all his debts, the executor or adminis­
trator may, with the approbation of the probate court, com·
pound with him and give him a discharge upon receiving a
fair and just dividend of his effects. 
Sec. 261. When there shall be a deficiency of as­
sets in the hands of an executor or administrator, and when
the deceased shall in his lifetime have conveyed any real estate
or any right or interest therein, with intent to defraud his
creditors or to avoid any right, duty or debt of any person, or
shall have so conveyed such estate, that by law the deeds or
conveyances are void as against creditors, the executor or ad­
ministrator may, and it shall be his duty to, commence and
prosecute to final judgment any proper action for the recovery
of the same, and may recover for the benefit of the creditors

give such security to the executor or administrator thereof, 
as the probate court shall direct. 
SEC. 263. The real estate so recovered shall be sold
for the payment of debts in the same manner as if the deceased
had died seized thereof, upon obtaining an order therefor

ment of debts of the deceased, in the same manner as other

CHAPTER XII. 
Of the Conveyance of Real Estate by Executors and Admin­
istrators in Certain Cases. 
SEC. 264. When any person who is bound by contract, in
writing, to convey any real estate, shall die before making the

deceased person, if living, might be compelled to make such
conveyance. 
Sec. 265. On presentation of a petition of any person
claiming to be entitled to such conveyance from any executor
or administrator, setting forth the facts upon which such
claim is predicated, the probate court shall appoirit a time and
place for hearing such petition, which shall be a.regular term
of the court, and shall order notice of the pending thereof, and
the time and place of hearing, to be published at least four
successive weeks next before such hearing, in such newspaper
in this Territory as the court shall designate. 
SEC. 266. At the time and place appointed for such hear·
Ing or at such other time as the same may be adjourned to,
upon proof by affidavit of the publication of the notice, the
'Court shall proceed to a bearing, and all persons interested in
the estate may appear and defend such petition, by filing their
objections in writing and the court may examine on oath the
petitioner and all who may be produced before him for that 
purpose.
SEC. 267. After a full hearing upon such petition and ob­ 
jections, and examination of the facts and circumstances of the
claim, if the probate court is satisfied that the petitioner is
entitled to a conveyance of the real estate described in the
petition, the court shall make a decree authorizing and direct·
Ing the executor or administrator to execute a conveyance 
thereof to the petitioner.
Sec. 268 Any person interested may appeal from such 
decree to the district court of the district embracing the 
county in which jurisdiction is exercised; but if no appeal be
taken from such decree within the time limited therefor, by
law, or if such decree be confirmed on appeal, it shall be
the duty of the executor or administrator to execute the con­
veyance according to the directions contained in the decree;
and a certified copy thereof shal be recorded with the deed in
the office of the recorder of the county where the lands lie, and
shall be evidence of the correctness of the proceedings and of
the authority of the executor or administrator to make such
conveyance. 
Sec. 269. If, upon a hearing in the probate court as here­
inbefore provided, the said court shall doubt the right of the
petitioner to have a specific performance of the contract, the
petition shall be dismissed without prejudice to the rights of

after, proceed in the district court to enforce a specific per- 
formance. ·
Sec. 270. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a de­ 
cree of the probate court as provided in this act, shall be effec­
tual to pass the estate contracted for as fully as if the con­
tracting party himself were still living and then executed the

by the probate court and duly certified and recorded in the
office of the recorder where the lands lie, shall give to the·
person entitled to the conveyance a right to the posaessiou

to the terms of the intended conveyance, in like manner as
if they had been conveyed in pursuance of the decree. 
Sec. 272. The recording of any decree, as provided in the
preceding section, shall not prevent the court making such de­
cree from enforcing the same by other process. 
Sec. 273. If the person to whom the conveyance was to be
made shall <lie before the commencement of the proceedings
according to the provisions of this act, or before the comple­
tion of the conveyance, any person who would have been entitled to the conveyance under him -as heir, devisee, or other­
wise, in case the conveyance had been made according to the 
terms of the contract, or the executor or administrator of such
deceased person, for the benefit of the person entitled. may
commence such proceedings or prosecute the same if already
commenced; and the conveyance shall be so made as to vest
the estate in the same persons who would have been entitled
to it. or in the executor or administrator for their benefit.

. and of the Payment of Debts. . 
Sec. 274. No executor or administrator shall be

specially authorized. 
Sec. 275. Every executor or administrator shall
be chargeable in his accounts with the whole estate of the de­

come of the estate. 
Sec. 276. He shall not make profit by the in­
crease nor suffer loss by the decrease or destruction, without
his fault, of any part of the estate. He shall account for the

the appraisement he shall not be responsible for the loss if the
sale has been justly made. 
Sec. 277. No executor or administrator shall be ac­
countable for any debts due the estate if it shall appear that
they remain .uncollected without his fault.

full compensation for his services, unless he shall by a written
instrument. filed in the probate court, renounce all claim for
compensation provided by the will. 
Sec. 279; No administrator or executor shall pur­
chase any claim against the estate he represents, and if he
shall have paid any claim for less than its nominal value, he
shall only be entitled to charge in his account so much as he
shall have actually paid.

and not exceeding two thousand dollars, at the rate of five
per cent.; for all above that sum, at the rate of four per cent,
and the same commission shall be allowed to · administrators.
In all cases such further allowance may be made as the pro­
bate court shall deem just and reasonable for any extraordi­
nary services not required of an executor or administrator in
the common course of his duty: Provided, That the total
amount of such allowance shall not exceed the amount of
commission allowed in this section. 
Sec. 281. Within six months after· his appoint­
ment, and thereafter at any time when required by the court,

appear on some day named in the citation, which shall be dur­
ing the term of a court, and render an exhibit as prayed for. 
SEC. 285. Whf'n an exhibit is rendered by an· ex­
ecutor or administrator, any person interested may appear,
and by objections in writing, contest any account or state­
ment therein contained. The court may examine the executor 
or administrator, and if he have been guilty of negligence, or
wasted, embezzled or mismanaged the estate, his letters shall 
be revoked.
Sec. 286. If any executor or, administrator neglect

render a full account of his administration at the expiration of
one year from the time of his .appointment. If he fail to pre­

interested in· the estate may apply for and obtain an attach­
ment, but no attachment shall issue unless a citation shall have
been first issued and returned, requiring the executor or ad­
ministrator to appear and show cause why an attachment
should not issue.

son interested In the estate, during the time he was adminis­
trator or executor. 
SEC. 289. If the executor or administrator resides with·
out the county, absconds or conceals himself so that 
citation cannot be personally served, and shall neglect to ren­
der an account within thirty days after having been com­ 
mitted when the attachment has been executed, his letters

specti ve parties may be adjourned from time to time as shall
be necessary.

saving, however, to all persons laboring under any legal dis­
ability, the right to proceed against the executor or admin­
istrator, either Individually or upon his bond, within two years
after their respective disabilities shall have ceased, and in
any action brought by any such person, the allowance and set­
tlement of the account shall be deemed presumptive evidence
of its correctness. 
Sec. 297. The account shall not be allowed bv the
court until it be first proven that notice has been given ·as re­ 
quired by this act, and the decree shall show that such proof

ecutor or administrator, the court shall specify in the decree
the sum to be paid each creditor. '

party when he shall become entitled thereto; or if he fail to
establish his claim, to be paid over or distributed, as the cir­
cumstances of the case may require: Provided, That if any
creditor whose claim has been allowed, but i~ not yet due,
shall appear and assent to a reduction therefrom of the legal
interest for the time the claim has yet to run he shall be entitled to be paid accordingly. · ·

by the probate court for the payment of creditors, the execu­
tor or administrator shall be personally liable to each creditor
for his claim, or the dividend thereon; and the execution

trict court in favor of each creditor; and the same proceedings
may be had under such execution, as if it had been issued from
the district court. The executor or administrator shall be
liable on his bond to each creditor. 
SEC. 305. When the accounts of the executor or
administrator have been settled, and an order made for the 
• payment of the debts and distribution of the estate, no credi­
tor whose name was not included in the order of payment,

whose claim was not due one year before the day of settle­
ment, or whose claim was contingent and did not become ab­

debts due by the estate, the executor or administrator shall
