Sec. 105. No variance between the allegation in a pleading, and the
proof, shall be deemed material, unless it shall have actually misled the
adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon
the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged that a party has been so mis
led, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in what
respect he has been misled, and, thereupon, the court may order the
pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just.
Sec. 106. "When the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the evi

ure of proof.
SEC. 108. Where the plaintiff in an action to recover the possession of
personal property- on a claim of being the owner thereof, shall fail to
establish on trial such ownership, but shall prove that he is entitled to

as may be proper, amend any pleadings or proceedings, by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the
name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like
terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may like
wise, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon such terms as may be just, an amend
ment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon
like terms, allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this

costs, relieve a party, or his legal representatives from a judgment,
order or other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inad
vertence, surprise or excusable neglect; and when for any cause satis
factory to the court, or the judge at chambers, the party aggrieved has
been unable to apply for the relief sought during the term at which such
judgment, order or proceeding complained of was taken, the court, or
the judge at chambers, in vacation, may grant the relief upon applica
tion made within a reasonable time, not exceeding five months after the
adjournment of the term.
Sec. 110. AVhen any pleading or proceeding is amended before trial,

motion of the adverse party, be stricken out of the case. When any
pleading contains more than one cause of action or defense, if the same

party, be stricken out of the case. When a motion to strike out is
allowed, the court may, upon such terms as may be proper, allow the
party to file an amended pleading; or, if the motion be disallowed, and
it appear to have been made in good faith, the court may, upon like
terms, allow the party to plead over.

true name shall be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be
amended accordingly.
SEC. 113. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any
error or defect in pleadings or proceedings which shall not affect the sub
stantial rights of the adverse party, and no judgment shall be reversed

deliver the order of arrest to the clerk, with his return endorsed there
on, and the bond of the bail, or a copy thereof. The plaintiff, within ten

OF ISSUES IN CIVIL ACTIONS.
Section
law
Section
200. Issues arise, when. Are of two kinds.
201. Issues of law.
202. Issue* of fact.
203. Issues of law and fact In same action;
llr-ii tried.
Sec. 200. Issue arises upon the pleading when a fact or conclusion
of law is maintained by the one party, and controverted by the other, and
are of two kinds:
1. Of law; and
2. Of fact.
Sec. 201. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the complaint,
answer, or reply, or to some part thereof.
Sec. 202. An issue of fact arises:
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint, controverted by the
answer; or
1. Upon new matter or a set-off, controverted by the reply; or
3. Upon new matter in the reply.
Sec. 203. Issues both of law and fact may arise upon different parts of
the pleading in the same action. In such cases, the issues of law shall
be first tried, unless the court otherwise direct.
Sec. 204. An issue of law shall be tried by the court, unless referred
as provided in this chapter. An issue of fact shall be tried by a jury,
unless a jury trial be waived, or a reference be ordered, as provided in
this chapter. The waiver of a jury, or agreement to refer, shall be by
stipulation of the parties filed, or the oral consent of parties given in
open court and entered in the records: Provided, Tl at nothing herein
contained shall be so construed as to restrict the chancery powers of the
judges, or to authorize the trial of any issue by a jury, when the com
plaint alleges an equitable claim, and seeks relief solely upon the ground
of the equities of the demand made by the pleadings in the action.
Sec. 205. A motion to continue a trial on the ground of the absence
of evidence, shall only be made upon affidavit, showing the materiality
of the evidence expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has
been used to procure it, and also the name and residence of the witness or
witnesses. The court may also require the moving party to state, upon affi
davit the evidence which he expects to obtain ; and if the adverse party ad
mit that such evidence would be given, and that it beconsided as actual
ly given on the trial, or offered and overruled as improper, the trial shall
not be continued. The court, upon its allowance of the motion, may im
pose terms or conditions upon the moving party.
Sec 206. When the action is called for trial, the clerk shall prepare
separate ballots, containing the names of the jurors summoned, who have
appeared and not been excused, and deposit them in a box. He shall
then draw from the box twelve names, and the persons whose names are
drawn shall constitute the jurj\ If the ballots become exhausted, before
the jury is 'complete, or if from any cause, a juror or jurors.be excused
or discharged, the sheriff, under the direction of the court, shall summon
from the bystanders, citizens of the county or district, as many qualified
persons as may be necessary to complete the jury. Whenever it shall
be requisite for the sheriff to summon more than one person at a time
from the bystanders or body of the district or county, the names of the
talesmen shall be returned to the clerk, who shall thereupon write the
names upon separate ballots and deposit the same in the trial jury box,
and draw 6uch ballots separately therefrom, as in the case of the regular
panel. The jury 6hall consist ot twelve persons, unless the parties con
sent to a less number. The parties may consent to any number not less
than three, and such consent'shall be entered by the clerk on the min
utes of the trial.
SEC. 207. Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are
several parties on. either side, they shall join in a challenge before it can
be made. The challenge shall be to individual jurors, and be peremp
tory or for cause. Each part}7 shall be entitled to three peremptory
challenges.
SEC. 20S. A peremotory challenge is an objection to a juror for which
no reason need be given, but upon which the court bIihII exclude him.
SEC. 200. A challenge for cause is an objection to a juror, and may be
either: .
1. General; that the juror is disqualified from serving in any action;
or •
2. Particular; that he is disqualified from serving in the action on
trial.
Sec. 210. General causes of challenge are:
1. A conviction for a felony.
2. A want of any of the qualifications prescribed by law for a juror.
3. Unsoundness of mind, or such defect in the faculties of the mind,
or organs of the body, as renders hiin incapable of performing the duties
of a juror.
Sec. 211. Particular causes of challenge are of two hinds:
1. For such a bias as when the existence of the facts is ascertained, in
judgment of law disqualifies the juror, and which is known in this code
as implied bias.
2. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of the juror in ref
erence to the action, or to either party, which satisfies the trier in the
exercise of a sound discretion, that be cannot try the issue impartially
and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging,
and which is known in this code as actual bias.
SEC. 212. A challenge for implied bias may be taken for any or all of
the following causes, and not otherwise:
1. Consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree to either party.
2. Standing in the relation of guardian and ward, attorney and client
master and servant or landlord and tenant, to the adverse party; or be
ing a member of the family of, or a partner in business with, or in the
employment for wages, of the adverse party, or being surety or bail in
the action called for trial, or otherwise, for the adverse party.
3. Having served as a juror on a previous trial in the same action, or
in another action between the same parties for the same cause of action,
or in a criminal action by the territory against either party, ^ipon sub
stantially the same facts or transaction.
i. Interest on the part of the juror in the event of the action, or the
principal question involved therein, excepting always, the interest of the
■juror as a member or citizen of the county or municipal corporation.
Sec. 213. A challenge for actual bias may be taken for the cause men
tioned in the second subdivsion of section two hundred and eleven. But
<>n the trial of such challenge, although it should appear that the juror
challenged has formed or expressed an opinion upon what he may have
heard or read, such opinion shall not of itself be sufficient to sustain the
challenge, but the court must be satisfied, from all the circumstances,
that the juror cannot disregard such opinion 'and try the issue impar
tially.
Sec. 214. An exemption from service on a jury shall not be cause of
challenge, but the privilege of the person exempted.
Sec. 215. The jurors having been examined as to their qualifications,
first by the plaintiff and then by the defendant, and passed for cause, the
peremptory challenges shall be conducted as follows, to- wit:
The plaintiff may challenge one, and then the defendant may challenge
one, aud so alternately until the peremptory challenges shall be exhausted.
The panel being filled and passed for cause, after said challenge shall have
been made by cither party, a refusal to challenge by either party in the
said order of alternation, shall not defeac the adverse party of his full
numbei of challenges, but such refusal on the part of the plaintiff to
exercise his challenge in proper turn, shall conclude him as to the jurors
once accepted by him, and if his right be not exhausted, his further chal
lenges shall be confined, in his proper turn, to talesmen only.
Sec. 216. The challenges of either party shall lie taken separately in
the following order, including in each challenge all the caucus ot chal
lenge belonging to the same class:
1. For general disqualification.
2. For implied bias.
3. For actual bias.
4. Peremptory.
Sec. 217. The challenge may be excepted to by the adverse party for
insufficiency, and if so, the court shall. determine the sufficiency thereof,
assuming the facts alleged therein to be true. The challenge, may be
denied by the adverse party, and if so, the court shall try the issue and
determine the law and the facts.
Sec. 218. Upon the trial of a challenge, the rules of evidence applica
ble to testimony offered upon the trial of an ordinary issue of fact shall
govern. The juror challenged, or any other person otherwise competent
may be examined as a witness by either party. If a challenge be deter
mined to be sufficient, or found to be true, as the case may be, it shall
be allowed, and the juror to whom it was taken excluded; but if deter
mined or found otherwise, it shall be disallowed.
Sec. 210. The challenge, the exception and the denial may be made
orally. The judge of the court shall note the same upon hfs minutes,
and the substance of the testimony on either side.
Sec. 220. As soon as the number of the jury has been completed, an
oath or affirmation shall be administered to the jurors, in substance that
they and each of them, will well, and truly try, the matter in issue
between the plaintiff and defendant, and a true verdict give, according to
the law and evidence as given them on the trial.
Sec. 221. When the jury has been sworn, the trial shall proceed in the
following order:
1. The plaintiff must briefly state the cause of action and the evidence
by which he expects to sustain it. The defendant may in like manner
state the defense aud the evidence he expects to offer in support thereof,
but nothing in the nature of comments or argument shall be allowed iu
opening the case. It shall be optional with the defendant whether he
states his case before or after the close of the plaintiff's testimony.
2. The plaintiff or the party upon whom rests the burden of proof in
the whole action, must first prodace his evidence; the adverse party will
then produce his evidence.
3. The parties will then be confined to rebutting evidence, unless the
court for good reasons, in furtherance of justice, permits them to offer
evidence in their original case.
4. When the evidence is concluded, either party may request the judge
to charge the jury in writing, in which event no other charge or instruc
tion shall be given, except the same be contained in the said written
charge; or either party may request instructions to the jury on points
of law, and if the court refuse to give the same, the party requesting
may except. Either party shall also be entitled to require of the judge
that all interlocutory orders, instructions or rulings upon the evidence
during the progress of the trial of a cause, shall be reduced to writing,
together with any exceptions that may be made thereto, ;md the same
shall be made a part of the record of the case, and any refusal on the part of the- judge trying the cause or making the order to comply with
all or any of the provisions of this section shall be regarded error, and
entitle the party whose request shall have been refused to a reversal of
the judgment on a writ of error: Provided, always, That the instruc
tion or ruling so requested is pertinent and consistent with the law and
evidence of the case, and that such refusal has worked an injury to the
party requesting the same.
5. After the conclusion of the evidence and the filing of request for
charge in writing or instructions, the plaintiff or party having the bur
den of proof may, by himself or one counsel, address the court and jury
upon the law and facts of the case, after which the adverse party may
address the court and jury in like manner by himself and one counsel,
or by two counsel, and be followed by the party or counsel of the party
first addressing the court. No more than two speeches on behalf of
plaintiff or defendant shall be allowed.
6. The court shall then charge the jury upon the law in the case. If
no request lias been made for said charge to be iu writing, or if no in
structions have been requested, said charge may be oral; but either party
at any time before the jury return their verdict, may except to the same
or any part thereof; but no exception shall bo regarded by the supreme
court, unless the same shall embody the specific parts of said charge to
which exception is taken. In charging the jury, the court shall state to
them all matters of law necessary for the information of the jury in find
ing a verdict; and if it become necessary to allude to the evidence, it
shall also inform the jury that they are the exclusive judges of all
questions of fact.
Sbo. 222. Any party may, when the evidence is closed, submit in dis
tinct and concise propositions the conclusions of fact which he claims to
be established, or the conclusions of law which he desires to be adjudged,
or both. They may be written and handed to the court, or at the option
of the court,"oral, and entered in the judge's minutes.
Sec. 223. All questions of law including the admissibility of testimony,
the facts preliminary to such admission, and the construction of statutes
and other writings, and other rules of evidence, are to be decided by the
court, and all discussions of law addressed to it.
Sec. 224. All questions of fact other than those mentioned in the sec
tion preceding, shall be decided by the jury, and all evidence thereon
addressed to them.
Sec. 225. Whenever in the opinion of the court it is proper that the
jury should have a view of real property which is the subject of litiga
tion, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order
the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of a proper officer, to
the place which shall be shown to them by the judge or by a person
appointed by the cotirt for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent
no person other than the judge, or person so appointed, shall speak to
them on any subject connected with the trial.
Sec. 228. The jurors may be kept together in charge of a proper offi
cer, or may, in the discretion of the court, at any time before the sub
mission of the cause to them, be permitted to separate; in either case
they may be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse
with any other person, or among themselves, on any subject connected
with the trial, or to express any opinion thereon, until the case is finally
submitted to them.
SEC. 227. If after the formation of the jury, and before verdict, a juror
become sick so as to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order
him to be discharged. In that case, unless the parties agree to proceed
with the other jurors, a new juror may be sworn and the trial begin
anew; or the jury may be discharged and a new jury then or afterwards
formed.
Sec. 228. A juror may be examined by either party as a witness, if he
be otherwise competent. If he be not so examined, he shall not com
municate any private knowledge or information that he may have of the
matter in controversy, to his fellow jurors, nor be governed by the same
in giving his verdict.
Ssc. 229. After hearing the charge, the jury may either decide in the
jury box or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they must be kept
together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient place
under the charge of one or more officers, until they agree upon their ver
dict, or are discharged by the court. The officer shall, to the best of his
ability, keep the jury thus separate from other persons, without drink,
except water, ana without food, except ordered by the court. He must
not suffer any communication to be made to them, nor make any him
self, unless by order of the court, except to ask them if they have agreed
upon their verdict, and he shall not, before the verdict is rendered, com
municate to any person the state of their deliberations or the verdict
agreed on.
Sec. 230. If, while the jury are kept together, either during the pro
gress of the trial or after their retirement for deliberation, the court
order them to be provided with suitable and sufficient, food and lodging,
they shall be so provided by the sheriff, at the expense of the county.
Sec. 231. Upon retiring for deliberation, the jury may take with them
the pleadings in the cause, and all papers which have been received as
evidence on the trial, (except depositions,) or copies of such parts of
public records or private documents given in evidence, as ought not,
in the opinion of the court, to be taken from the person having them in
possession.
SEC. 232. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a
disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if they
desire to be informed of any point of law arising in the case, they may
require the officer having them in charge to conduct them into court.
Upon their being brought into court the information required shall be
given ill the presence of or after notice to the parties, or their attorneys.
'Sec. 233. The jury may be discharged by the court on account of the
sickness of a juror, or other accident or calamity requiring their dis
charge, or by consent of both parties, or after they have been kept
together until it satisfactorily appears that there is no probability of
their agreeing.
Sec. 234. In all cases where a jury are discharged or prevented from
giving a verdict by reason of accident or other cause, during the progress
of the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, the action shall be
continued to the next term, unless both parties demand an immediate
trial, in which case it shall go to the foot of the trial list.
SEC. 235. While the juiy are absent the court may adjourn from time
to time, in respect to other business, but it is nevertheless to be deemed
open for every purpose connected with the cause submitted to the-jury
until a verdict is rendered or the jury discharged. A final- adjournment
of the court discharges the jury.
Sec. 230. "When the jury have agreed upon their verdict they shall be
conducted into court by the officer having them in charge. Their names
shall then he called, and if all do not appear, the rest shall be discharged
without giving a verdict.
Sec. 23.7. If the jury appear, they shall be asked by the court or. the
clerk whether they have agreed upon their verdict, and if the foreman
answer in the affirmative, Tie shall on being required declare the same.
Sec. 238. When a verdict is given and before it is filed, the jury may
be polled at the request of either party, for which purpose each shall be
asked whether it is his verdict; if any juror answer in the negative the
jury shall be sent out for further deliberation. If the verdict be infor
mal or insufficient, it may be corrected by the jury under the advice of
the court, or the ju,ry may again be sent out.
Sec. 239. When the verdict is given and is such as the court may
receive, and if no juror disagree or the jury be not again sent out, the
clerk shall file the verdict. The verdict is then complete and the jury
shall be discharged from the case. The verdict shall be in writing, and
under the direction of the court shall be substantially entered in the
journal as of the day's proceedings on which it was given.

ner and for the same reason as far as applicable, and a new trial granted.
Seo. 248. All or any of the issues in the action, whether of fact or
law, or both, may be referred upon the written consent of the parties;
but either party shall have the right in an action at law, upon an issue of
fact, to demand a trial by jury.
Sec. 249. Where the parties do not consent the court or judge may
upon the application of either, direct a reference in all cases formerly
cognizable in chancery in which reference might be made:
1. When the trial of an issue of fact shall require the examination of
a long account on either side, in which case the referees may be directed
to hear and decide the whole issue, or to report upon any specific ques

same except to the decision rejecting such evidence at the time, the ex
ceptions shall be noted by the referees and theyshall take and receive
such testimony and file it with the report. Whatever judgment the

thereby incurred.

case may require. If the report be filed in vacation the like proceedings
may be had at the next term following.
Sec. 256. The court may affirm or set aside the report either in whole
or in part. If it affirms the report it shall give judgment accordingly.

the sheriff for the entire property, the claimant shall pay the costs; when
the claimant recovers all the property, judgment shall be given in favor
of the claimant for costs; when the claimant recovers a portion of the
property only, the costs shall be apportioned. "When the plaintiff pre

as provided in the preceding section. Such property may be delivered,
paid or transferred to the sheriff at the time of the levy, or sufficient
thereof to satisfy the execution; and the sheriff's receipt to the person,
association or corporation, as the ca.-e may be, .shall lie «, sufficient dis
charge therefor.
Sec. 358. AY hen the sheriff shall levy upon personal property, by vir
tue of an execution, he may permit the judgment debtor to retain he
same, or any part thereof, in his possession until the day of sale, upon
the defendant executing a written bond to the sheriff with sufficient

be delivered to the sheriff at the time and place of sale, and for non-de

iff or the plaintiff in the execution; but the sheriff shall not thereby be
discharged from his liability to the plaintiff for such property.

describing the property, for four weeks successively, in three public
places of the county where the property is to be sold, and publishing a
copy thereof, once a week for the same period, in a newspaper of the
county, if there be one, or if there be none, then in a newspaper pub
lished nearest to the place of sale.
Sec. 360. All sales of property upon execution, shall be made by auc
tion between nine o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the after

deputy, shall become a purchaser or be interested in any purchase at
such sale. When the sale is of personal property capable of manual de

ation, it shall be within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold in
snch parcels as are likely to bring the highest price ; and when the sale is of
real property and consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall
be sold separately or otherwise as is likely to bring the highest price, or

for the like cause, giving notice of every adjournment by public procla
mation made at the same time, and by posting written notices of such
adjournment under the notices of sale originally posted by him. The
sheriff for like causes may also adjourn the sale from time to time, not
exceeding thirty days beyond the day at which the writ is made returna
ble, with the consent of the plaintiff endorsed upon the writ.
Sec. 362. When the purchaser of any personal property, capable of
manual delivery, and not in the possession of a third person, association
or corporation, shall pay the purchase money, the sheriff shall deliver to
him the property, and if desired shall give him a bill of sale containing
an acknowledgment of the payment. In all other sales of personal prop
erty the sheriff shall give the purchaser a bill of sale with the like ac
knowledgment.

town lots shall be sold by the acre.
Sec. 361. When the land is sold by the acre and any less number of
acres than the whole tract or parcel is sold, it shall be measured off to
the purchaser in a square form, from the north-east corner of the tract
or parcel, unless some person having an interest in the land shall, at the
the sale, or prior thereto and before the bidding is made, request that the
land sold shall be taken from some other part, or in some other form;
in such case, if such request is reasonable, the officer making the sale
shall sell accordingly.
Sec. 365. When an entire tract or parcel of land is sold by the acre, it
shall not be measured but shall be deemed and taken to contain the
number of acres named in the description, and be paid for accordingly;

be had:
1. The plaintiff shall be entitled, on motion therefor, to have an order
confirming the sale at the term next following the return of the execu
tion, or if it be returned in term time, then at such term, unless the
judgment debtor, or in case of his death, his representatives, shall file
with the clerk, ten days before such term, or it the writ be returned
in term time, then five days after the return thereof, his objections
thereto.
2. If such objections be filed the court shall notwithstanding allow
the order -confirming the sale, unless on the hearing of the motion, it
shall satisfactorily appear that there were substantial irregularities in
the proceedings concerning the sale, to the probable loss or injury of the
party objecting. In the latter case, the court shall disallow the motion,
and direct that tLe property be resold in whole or in part, as the case may
be, as upon an execution received of that date.
3. Upon the return of the execution, the sheriff shall pay the proceeds
of the sale to the clerk, who shall then apply the same or so much there

to any person other than the former purchaser, the clerk shall first repay
to such purchaser the amount of his bid out of the proceeds of the latter
6ale.
4. Upon a resale, the bid of the purchaser at the former sale shall be
deemed to be renewed and continue in force, and no bid shall be taken
except for a greater amount. If the motion to confirm be not heard and
decided at the term at which it is made, it may be continued and heard
and determined before the judge, or at any term thereafter. An order
confirming a sale shall be a conclusive determination of the regularity
of the proceedings concerning such sale as to all persons in any other
action, suit or proceeding whatever.
5. If after the satisfaction of the judgment, there be any proceeds of
the sale remaining, the clerk shall pay such proceeds to the judgment
debtor or his representative, as the case may be, at any time before the
order is made upon the motion to confirm the sale, provided such party
file with the clerk a waiver of all objections made or to be made to the
proceedings concerning the sale; but if the sale be confirmed, such pro
ceeds shall be paid to such party of course, otherwise they shall remain
in the custody of the clerk until the sale of the property has beeu dis
posed of.
Seo. 368. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his
successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of the reveisal
of the judgment, he may recover the price paid with interest and the
costs and disbursements of the suit by which he was evicted, from the
plaintiff in the writ of execution.
Sec. 369. When property liable to an execution against several persons
is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is
levied upon the property of one of them, or one of them pays without a
sale more than his proportion, he may compel contributions from the
others; and when a judgment is against several, and is upon an obliga
tion or contract of one of them as security for another, and the surety
pays the amount or any part thereof, either by sale of his property or
before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. In such case
the person so paying or contributing, shall be entitled to the benefit of
the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment, if within thirty days
after his payment, he file with the clerk of the court where the judgment
was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to contribution or repay

the margin of the docket where the judgment is entered.

with the amount of any taxes which the purchaser may have paid there
on, and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a lien prior to that of
the redeinptioner, the amount of such lien with interest.
Sec. 373. If the property be so redeemed by a redeinptioner, either
the judgment debtor or any other redemptioner may, within sixty days
from the last redemption, again redeem it on paying the sum paid on the

Sec. 375. The mode of redeeming shall be as provided in this section:
1. The person seeking to redeem shall give the purchaser or redemp
tioner, as the case may be, two days' notice of his intention to apply to
the sheriff for that purpose. At the time and place specified in said
notice, such person may redeem by paying to the sheriff the sum re
quired. ' The sheriff shall give the person redeeming a certificate as in.

redemption. .

the mail or by some private person.
Sec. 418. Such deposition may be used by either party upon the trial
or other proceeding against any party giving or receiving the notice,
subject to all legal exceptions, to the competency or credibility of the wit
ness, or the manner of taking the deposition. But if the parties attend,
at the examination, no objection to the form of an interrogatory shall be
made at the trial, unless the same was taken at the time of the examin
ation. It shall be the duty of the person taking the deposition to pro
pound to the witness every question proposed by either party, and to
note all objections to the form of any interrogatory, and when any inter
rogatory is objected to on account of form, unless the form is amended
and the objection waived, he shall write after the question and before the
answer the words "objected to," and when any witness declines to answer
a question on the ground that it will criminate himself, that fact shall
also be noted after the question if written down. The deposition may
be taken in the form of a narative, or by question and answer, or partly
in either form, as either party present at the examination shall require.
When taken by question and answer, the officer shall first write down
the question and then the answer, as nearly as may be in the language
of the witness; but when the deposition is read to the witness previous
to signing it, he shall be permitted toamond his answer to any question
or any part of his deposition; such amendment, however, unless both
parties shall otherwise agree, shall not be made by way of interlining or
erasing, but shall be added at the end of the deposition under the title
'■amendment by the witness," and such amendment shall intelligibly
refer to the part so amended.
Sec. 419. No deposition shall be used if it appear that the reason for
taking it no longer exists: Provided, however, That if the party pro
ducing the deposition in such case shall show any sufficient cause then
existing for using such deposition, it may be admitted.
Sec. 420. When the plaintiff" in any action shall discontinue it, or
when it shall be dismissed for any cause, and another action shall after
wards be commenced for the same cause between the same parties, or
their respective representatives, all depositions lawfully taken in the first
action may be used in the other, in the same manner and subject to the
same conditions and objections as if originally taken for such other
action: Provided, That the deposition shall have been duly filed in the
court where the first action was pending, and shall have remained in the
custody of the court, from the termination of the first action until the
commencement of the other.
SEC. 421. When any action shall have been appealed from one court
to another, all depositions lawfully taken to be used in the court below,
may be used in the appellate court, in the same manner and subject to
such exceptions for informality or irregularit}', .and none other, as
were taken in writing to such depositions in the court below.
Sec. 422. Any witness may be subpceued and compelled, by any officer
authorized to take depositions, to appear and give his deposition at any
place within twenty miles of the abode of such witness, in like manner
as he may be subpoened and compelled to attend as a witness in any
court, and he shall suffer the same penalties for a failure to attend as are
prescribed in chapter 37 of this act.

returned, and the defendant held to appear as in an original- action. The
facts stated in the petition shall be considered as denied without answer.
The case shall be tried as other cases by ordinary proceedings, but no
motion shall be filed more than one year after the final judgment was
rendered.
Sec. 438. The proceedings to correct mistakes or omissions of the clerk
or irregularity in obtaining a judgment or order, shall be by motion
served on the adverse party, or on his attorney in the action, and within
one year; and when made to vacate a judgment because of irregularity

Sec. 439. The proceedings to obtain the benefit of subdivisions four,

fense to the action, if the party applying was a defendant; and such pro
ceedings must be commenced within one year after the judgment or
order was made, unless the party entitled thereto be a minor or person
of nnsound mind, and then within one year from the removal of such
disability.
Sec. 440. In such proceedings the party shall be brought into court in
the same way, on the same notice as to time, mode of service, and mode
of return, and the pleadings shall be governed by the principles, and
issues be made np by the same form, and all the proceedings conducted

Sec. 442. The court may first try and decide upon the grounds to va
cate or modify a judgment or order, before trying or deciding upon the

For the exercise of such appellate jurisdiction, section 1869 of the re
vised statutes of the United States, providing for the allowance of writs
of error, bills of exception and appeals, and tor the exercise of chancery
as well as common law shall govern. Every final judgment, order or de
cision of a district court or judge thereof, in actions at law, as the same
are known and recognized, may be re-examined by writ of error in the su-
Ereme court, for error in law. In such cases the supreme court shall
ear and determine the cause upon the errors assigned in the notice of
the plaintiff in error. The party suing out such writ of error, shall be
called the plaintiff in error and the adverse party shall be called the de
fendant in error. Every final judgment, order, or decision of a district
court, or judge thereof, in actions of an equitable nature, where equita
ble relief is sought, or where chancery jurisdiction has been exercised,
shall be reviewed in the supreme court by appeal. In all such equita
ble causes, the party taking or prosecuting the appeal shall be known as
the appellant; the adverse party the appellee. When both parties ap
peal, the cause shall be docketed as it was in the court below. In suits
of error and appeals, subject always to the distinction herein recognized,
the practice shall be as hereinafter prescribed.
Sec. 446. An appeal or writ of error may also be taken to the su
preme court from the following orders:
1. An order made affecting a substantial right in an action, when such
order, in effect, determines the action and prevents a judgment from
which an appeal might be taken.
2. A final order made in special proceedings affecting a substantial
right therein, or made on a summary application in an action after judg
ment.
3. "When an order grants or refuses, continues, or modifies a provis
ional remedy; or grants, refuses, dissolves, or refuses to dissolve an in
junction or attachment; when it grants or refuses a new trial, or when
it sustains or overrules a demurrer.
4. An intermediate order involving the merits and materially affect
ing the final decision.
5. An order or judgment on habeas corpus. If any of the above or
ders are made by a judge, the same is recorded in the same way as if
made by a court.
Sec. 447. The court may also, in its discretion, prescribe rules for
allowing appeals or writs of error on such other intermediate orders or
decisions as is deemed expedient, and for permitting the same to be
taken and tried during the progress of the trial in the court below; but
such intermediate appeals- or writs must not retard proceedings in the
court from which the appeal is taken.
SEC. 448. A mistake of the clerk shall not be ground for an appeal or
writ of error, until the same has been presented and acted upon by the
court below.
Sec. 449. A judgment or order shall not be reversed for an error
which can be corrected on motion in an inferior court, until such motion
has been made and overruled.
Sec. 450. The supreme court may review and reverse on appeal, or
writ of error, any judgment or order of the district court, although no
motion for a new trial was made in such court.
Sec. 451. When a cause is tried by the court, it shall not be necessary
in order to secure a review of the same in the supreme court, that there
should have been any finding of facts or conclusions of law stated in the
record; but the supreme court shall hear and determine the same when
ever it shall appear from a certificate of the judge, agreement of parties,
or their attorneys, or, in case the evidence consists wholly of written tes
timony, from the certificate of the clerk, that the transcript contains all
the evidence introduced by the parties on the trial in the court below.
Seo. 452. The court may issue all writs and process necessary for the
exercise and enforcement of its appellate jurisdiction.
Sec. 543. Appeals and writs of error from the district court may be
taken to the supreme court at any time within six months from the ren
dition of the judgment or order appealed from, or complained of, and
not afterward. But nothing herein contained shall prevent the district
judge who tried tlie cause, to make certificate that the cause involves the
determination of a question of law, upon which it is desirable to have
the opinion of the supreme court. In such cases said judge may direct
a special verdict to be found, and in all cases the parties may make an
agreed statement of facts, signed by themselves or their attorneys,
which shall be entered of record, which shall have the effect of a special
verdict, and may under the direction of the judge of the district court,
be taken to the supreme court, and for that purpose the district court
shall render a judgment in form only, which shall not be executed until
the final decision of the cause. The supreme court, on hearing such cases,
may give judgment or remand the cause for further proceedings in the
district court.
Sec. 454. A part of several co-parties may appeal or prosecute a writ
of error; but in such case they must serve notice thereof upon all the
other co-parties and file the proof thereof with the clerk of the supreme
court.
Stx. 455. If the other co-parties refuse to join, they cannot nor can
any of them, take an appeal or writ of error afterwards; nor shall they
derive any benefit from the appeal, or suit in error unless from the
necessity of the case.
SEC. 450. Unless they appear and decline to join, they shall be deemed
to have joined and shall be liable for their due proportion of costs.
Sec. 457. An appeal or writ of error from part of an order, or from
one of the judgments of a final adjudication, or from part of a judg
ment, shall not disturb or delay the rights of any party to any judgment
or part of any judgment, or order not appealed from, but the same shall
proceed as if no such appeal had been made."
Sue. 458. An appeal, or writ ot error is taken by filing with the clerk
of the court in which the judgment or order appealed from is entered
a notice, stating the appeal from the same, or some specific part thereof,
and serving a copy of said notice on the adverse party or his attorney.
Every notice of appeal or writ of error must be signed by the party
taking the same, or his attorney of record, and must contain the title of
the district court in which the proceedings sought to reviewed were had;
the title of the cause as in the district court; a particular description of
the judgment, decree or order sought to be reviewed; and, in case of
appeal, a particular description of every decision, ruling, order or decree
by which the appellant claims to have been aggrieved and which he
relies upon as ground for a reversal or modification of the judgment,
order or decree; and in case of a writ of error, a particular description
of the errors assigned.
SEC. 459. An appeal shall not be perfected until the notice thereof
has been served upon the adverse party, or his attorney of record. Upon
payment ot his fees, the clerk shall forthwith transmit by mad, express,
or messenger, not a party, nor the attorney of a party, a transcript of
the record in the cause, or so much thereof as the appellant, or plaintiff
in error, in writing, in the notice has directed, to which shall be appended
copies of the notice of appeal, and the supersedeas bond, if any.
Sec. 400. The notice of appeal or suit in error, must be served at least
thirty days, and the cause filed and docketed at least fifteen days before
the first day of the next term of the supreme court, or the same shall
not then be tried unless by consent of parties. If the appeal or writ of
error is taken less than thirty days before the term, it must be so filed
and docketed, before the next succeeding term.
Sec. 461. If the appellant fails to file a transcript, and have the cause
docketed, as provided in the preceding section, the appellee or defendant
in error may file a certified copy of the judgment or order appealed from,
and of the notice served, and, on motion, have the appeal, or suit in er
ror dismissed, or the judgment or order appealed from affirmed: Provkled,
That when the failure to file the transcript is owing to the fault or
omission of the clerk of either the appellate or inferior court, or other
circumstance, over which the appellant has no control, the court shall
not dismiss the cause, but shall fix such time for hearing the same, as
will insure a fair trial.
Sec. 462. If the transcript has been sent up, but the appellant or plain
tiff in error does not file the same when the same should be filed, as
herein provided, the appellee or defendant in error may file the same,
and may, on motion, have the appeal dismissed or judgment affirmed,
as the court from the circumstances of the case shall determine.
Sec. 463. If the transcript has been sent up, and errors have not been
assigned in the notice as hereinbefore required, the appellee or defend
ant in error may have the appeal or writ of error dismissed or the judg
ment or order affirmed, unless good cause for the failure be shown by
affidavit.
Sec. 464. In an action by ordinary proceedings, and in an action by
equitable proceedings, tried in whole or in part on oral testimony, all
proper entries made by the clerk, and all papers pertaining to the cause
and filed therein, except subpoenas, depositions, and other papers which
are used as mere evidence, are to be deemed part of the record. But in
an action by equitable proceedings, tried upon written testimony, the
depositions and all papers which were used as evidence, are to be certi
fied up to the supreme court, and shall be so certified, not by transcript,
but in the original form. But a transcript of a motion, affidavit or
other paper, when it relates to a collateral matter, shall not be certified
unless by direction of the appellant. If so certified, when not material
to the determination of the appeal or writ of error, the court may direct
the person blameable therefor to pay the costs thereof.
Sec. 465. Tlie appellant or plaintiff in error shall file a perfect trans
cript, and to that end the clerk of the court below must, at any time on
his suggestion of the diminution of the record and on the payment of
fees, certify up any omitted part of the record, according to the truth, as
the same appears of record in his office; and such appellant shall not be
entitled to any continuance in order to correct the record, unless it shall
clearly appear to the court that he is not in fault. Subject to which re
quirement, either party may, on motion before trial day, obtain an order
on the clerk below, commanding him to transmit at once to the supreme
court a true copy of such imperfect or omitted part of the record as shall
be in general terms described in the affidavit or order. Such motion
must be supported by affidavit, unless the diminution be apparent or ad
mitted by the adverse party, and must not be granted unless the court
is satisfied that it is not made for delay.
Sec. 466. An appeal or writ of error shall not be dismissed for any
informality or defect in the notice or the service thereof, if from the
transcript it can be reasonably understood that the adverse party has had
sufficient notice of the pendency of the suit in error or appeal, and the
notice recites the errors alleged or the order or judgment complained of
with such certainty, that his substantial right would not be prejudiced
bv the hearing of the -cause. And the supreme court shall, upon reason
able terms, allow all amendment's in matters of form, curative of such
defects, to the end that substantial justice be secured to the parties.
SEC. 467. An appeal or writ of error shall not stay proceedings on the
judgment or order or any part thereof, unless the appellant shall cause
to be executed before the clerk of the court which rendered the judg

proved by the clerk, and filed, he shall issue a written order command
ing the appellee and all others to stay proceedings on such judgment or
order, or on such part as is superseded as the case may be. No appeal
or stay shall vacate or affect the judgment not appealed from.

the steps taken by the appellant or plaintiff in error with reference to his
appeal, and of his giving, or offering to give, an appeal bond, of the ac
tion of the clerk of the court below, with reference to such "bond, and
wherein he has acted wrongfully; and if the supreme court, or any judge
thereof, considers that the clerk has made unjust conditions in the bond,
or the penalty thereof too high, or has wrongfully refused to approve the
same, such court or judge shall issue an order prescribing the conditions
of the appeal bond, fixing the penalty thereof and either approve it or
direct the clerk of the supreme court so to do, which bond shall be filed
with the officer last named. The supreme court, or judge thereof, may
order that all or any part of the papers and records in the cause appeal
ed, or certified copies thereof, be produced on the hearing of such motion,
and pending the disposition thereof, may make an order staying the en
forcement of the judgment or order appealed from, and on such terms
as are just. The order, if made by the judge, shall be in writing and
signed by him, and upon the service thereof, or of a certified copy, when
made in court, upon the clerk of the court below, all proceedings in the
court appealed from shall be staved, and all orders, all processes, execu
tions, or other papers issued therefrom shall be recalled, and the appell
ant or plaintiff in error be placed in the same condition that he was when

or such judge shall consider the sureties insufficient, or the bond sub
stantially defective in securing the rights of the appellee, the court or
such judge shall issue an order discharging such bond, unless a good bond
with sufficient sureties, be executed before a day by him fixed. The or
der, if made by a judge, shall be in writing and signed by him; and upon
his filing, or the filing of a certified copy of the order, when made in
court, in the office of the clerk of the inferior court, execution and other
proceedings for enforcing the judgment or order may be taken if a new
and good bond is not tiled and approved by the day as aforesaid.
Sec. 470. But another order staying proceedings may be issued by the
clerk, upon execution before him, of a new and lawful bond with sufficiient
sureties as hereinbefore provided.
Sec. 471. If the judgment or order is for the payment of money, the
fenalty shall be in at least twice the amount of the judgment and costs,
f not for the payment of money the penalty shall be sufficient to save
the appellee or defendant in error harmless from the consequences of
taking the appeal or writ of error. But it shall in no case be less than
one hundred dollars.
Sec. 472. The taking of the appeal from a part of a judgment or or
der, and the filing of a bond as above directed, does not cause a stay of
execution as to any part of the judgment or order not appealed from.
Sec. 473. If execution has issued prior to the filing of the bond above
contemplated, the clerk shall countermand the same.
Sec. 474. Property levied upon and not sold at the time such counter
mand is received by the sheriff, shall forthwith be delivered up to the
judgment debtor.
Sec. 475. The supreme court may reverse, affirm or modify the judg
ment or order below, or the part of either appealed from, or may render

appellee, or defendant in error, damages upon the amount superseded;
and, if satisfied by the record that the appeal or writ of error was taken
for delay only, must award such sum as damages, not exceeding fifteen
per cent, thereon, as shall effectually tend to prevent the taking of ap
peals or writs of error for delay only.
Sec. 478. If the supreme court affirm or modify the judgment or or
der, it may send the cause to the court below to have the same carried
into effect, or it may itself issue the necessary process for this purpose,
and direct such process to the sheriff of the proper county as the party
may require.
Sec. 479. If, by the decision of the supreme court, the appellant or
plaintiff in error becomes entitled to a restoration of any part of the
monev or property that was taken from him, by means of such judgment

tinued by consent, or for cause shown by the party, and the party may
be heard orally or otherwise, in his discretion.
Sec. 486. No cause is decided until the opinion in writing is filed with
the clerk.
Sec. 487. If remanded to the inferior court to be carried into effect,
such decision and the order of the court thereon, being certified thereto
and entered on the records of the court, shall have the same force and
effect as if made and entered during the session of the court in that dis
trict.
Sec. 488. An assignment of error need follow no stated form, but
must in a way as specific as the case will allow, point out the very error
objected to; among several points in a demurrer, or in a motion, or instruc
tions, or rulings in an exception, it must designate which is relied on as
an error; and the court will only regard errors which are assigned with
the required exactness; but the court must decide on each error assigned.

hold the same subject to the control of the court.
Sec. 491. The death of one or all of the parties shall not cause the pro
ceedings to abate, but the names of the proper persons shall be substi

6uch a course will be calculated to promote the ends of justice.

fuither right to prosecute the appeal or writs of error, the appellee or

ment of such action, except as in this section provided. When service

CHAPTER XLYII.
Sec. 551. In an action at law, for the recovery of the possession of
real property, if either party claim the property as a donee of the
United States, and under the act of congress approved September 27th,
1S50, commonly called the "Donation law," or the acts amendatory
thereof, such party, from the date of his settlement thereon, as pro
vided in said act, shall be deemed to have a legal estate in fee, in such
property, to continue upon condition that he perform the conditions re
quired by such acts, which estate is unconditional and indcfeasable after
the performance of such conditions. In such action, if both plaintiff
and defendant claim title to the same real property, by virtue of settle
ment, under such acts, such settlement and performance of the subse
quent condition shall be prima facie presumed in favor of the party hav
ing or claiming under the elder certificate, or patent, as the case may be,
unless it appears upon the face of such certificate or patent that the same
is absolutely void. Any person in possession, by himself or his tenant,
of real property, and any private or municipal corporation in possession
by itself or its tenant of any real property, or when such real property is
not in the actual possession of any one, any person or private or municipal
corporation claiming title to any real property under a patent from the
United States, or during his or its claim of title to such real property
under a patent from the United States for such real estate, may main
tain a civil action against any person or persons, corporations or associa
tions claiming an interest in said real property or any part thereof, or
or any right thereto adverse to him, them, or it, for the purpose of de
termining such claim, estate, or interest; and where several persons, or
private or municipal corporations are iti possession of, or claim as afore
said, separate parcels of real property, and an adverse interest is claimed
oi claim made in or to any such parcels, by any other person, persons,
corporations or associations, arising out of a question, conveyance,
statute, grant, or other matter common to all such parcels of real estate,
all or any portion of such persons or corporations so in possession, or claim
ing such parcel of real property may unite as plaintiffs in such suit to
determine such adverse claim or interest against all persons, corporations,
or associations claiming such adverse interest.
Sec. 552. When several persons hold and are in possession of real
property as tenants in common, in which one r>r more of them have an
estate of inheritance, or for life or years, an action may be maintained
by one or more of such persons, for a partition thereof, according to the
respective rights of the persons interested therein, and for sale- of such
'property, or a part of it, if it appear that a partition cannot be made
without great prejudice to the owners.
Sec. 553. The interest of all persons in the property shall be set forfh
in the complaint specifically and particularly as far as known to the
plaintiff, and if one or more of the parties, or the share or quantity of
interest, of any of the parties be unknown to the plaintiff, or be uncer

executory devise, or the remainder be a contingent remainder, so that
such parties cannot be named, that fact shall be set forth in the com
plaint.
Sec. 554. The plaintiff may, at his option, make creditors having a
Hen upon the property or any portion thereof, other than by a judgment
or decree, defendants in the suit. When the lien is upon an undivided
interest or estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made,
is thenceforth a lien only on the share assigned to such party; but such
share shall be first charged with its just proportion of the costs of the
partition, in preference to such lien.
Sec. 555. The notice shall be directed by name to all the tenants in
common, who are known, and in the same manner to all lien creditors
who are made parties to the suit, and generally to all persons unknown,
having or claiming an interest or estate in the property.
Sec. 556. If a party, having a share or interest in, or lien upon the
property, be unknown, or either of the known parties reside out oi the
territory or cannot be found therein, and such fact be made to appear by
affidavit, the notice may be served by publication, as in ordinary
cases. When service is made by publication, the notice must contain
a brief description of the property which is the subject of the suit.
Seo. 557. Ihe defendant shall set forth in his answer, the nature, and
extent of his interest in the property, and if he be a lien creditor, how
such lien was created, the amount of the debt secured thereby and re
maining due, and whether such debt is secured in any other way, and
if so, the nature of such other security.
Sec. 55S. The rights of the several parties, plaintiffs as well as defend
ants, may be put in issue, tried and determined in such suit, and where
a defendant fails to answer, or where a sale of the property is necessary,
the title shall be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction of the court,
before the decree for partition or sale is given.
Sec. 559. If it be alleged in the complaint and established by evi
dence, or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation in the com
plaint, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property or any part
of it, is so situated that partition cannot be made without great preju
dice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof, and for that pur
pose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise, upon the requisite
proofs being made, it shall decree a partition according to the respective
rights of the parties as ascertained by the court, and appoint three ref
erees, therefor, and shall designate the portion to remain undivided for
the owners whose interests remain unknown or are not ascertained.
Seo. 560. In making the partition, the referees shall divide the prop
erty, and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, qual

tions by proper landmarks, and may employ a surveyor with the neces
sary assistants to aid them therein. The referees shall make a report
of their proceedings, specifying therein the manner of executing their
trust, describing the property divided and the shares allotted to each
party, with a particular description of each share.
Sec. 561. The court may confirm or set aside the report in whole or in
part, and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon the report being
confirmed a decree shall be entered that such partition be effectual for
ever, which decree shall be binding and conclusive:

have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any part thereof
as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years, or as entitled to the
reversion, remainder or inheritance of such property or any part thereof,
after the termination of a particular estate therein, or who by any con
tingency may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who
have an interest in any undivided share thereof, as tenants for years or
for life.
2. On all persons interested in the property to whom notice shall have
been given by publication.
3. On all other persons claiming from or through such parties or*persons
or either of them.
Sec. 562. Such decree and partition shall not affect any tenants for
years or for life, of the whole of the property which is the subject of

property in question, or from controverting the title of the parties be
tween whom the partition shall have been made.
Sec. 563. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor
and his assistants, when employed, shall be ascertained and allowed by
the court, and the amount thereof, together with the fees allowed by law
to the referees, shall be paid by the plaintiff and may be allowed as costs.
Sec. 56±. If the referees report to the court that the property, of which
partition shall have been decreed, or any separate portion thereof is so

to the owners, and the court is satisfied that 'such report is correct, it
may thereupon by an order direct the referees to sell the property or
separate portion thereof.
SEC. 565. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold, if
there be an estate for life or years in an undivided share of the property}
the whole of such estate may be set off in any part of the property not
ordered sold.
SEC. 560. Before making an order of sale, if lien creditors, other than
those by judgment or degree, have not been made parties^ the court, on
motion of either party, shall order the plaintiff to file a supplemental
complaint, making such creditors defendants.
Sec. 567. If an order of sale be made before the distribution of the
proceeds thereof, the plaintiff shall produce to the court the certificate of
the auditor of the county where the property is situated, showing the
liens remaining unsatisfied, if any, by judgment or decree upon the prop
erty or any portion thereof, and unless he do so the court shall order a
referee to ascertain them.
SEC. 568. If it appear by such certificate or reference, in case the cer
tificate is not produced, that any such liens exist, the court shall appoint
a referee to ascertain what amount remains due thereon or secured there
by respectively, and the order of priority in which they are entitled to
be paid out of the property.
SEC. 56[). The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served at least twenty
days before the time for appearance on eacli person having such lien by

3. To satisfy the several liens in their order of priority, by payment
of he sums due, and to become due, according to the decree.
4. The residue among the owners of the property sold, according to
their respective shares.
Sec. 574. Whenever any party to the suit, who holds a lien upon the
property or any part thereof, lias other securities for the payment of the
amount of such lien, the court may in its discretion, order such sureties
to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may or
der a just deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the
property on account thereof.

sideration by a testator to convey any property, devised or bequeathed in

ness, to whom any beneficial devise, legacy or gift may have been made

satisfied that the adverse party has been misled to his prejudice thereby.
SEC. 1766. The pleadings may he amended at any time before the trial,
or during the trial, or upon appeal, to supply any deficiency or omissions
in the allegations or denials, necessary to support the action or defense,
when by such amendment substantial justice will be promoted. If the

isfaction of the court that a continuance is necessary to the adverse party
in consequence of such amendment, a continuance shall be granted. The
court may also, in its discretion, require as a condition of an amend
ment, the payment of costs to the adverse party.

further sum in favor of the defendant.
