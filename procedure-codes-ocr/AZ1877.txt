undertaking to be executed by two or more sufficient sureties, stating their
places of residence and occupations, to the effect that they are bound in
the amount mentioned in the order of arrest; that the defendant shall, at
all times, render himself amenable to the process of the court during the
pendency of the action, and to such as may be issued to enforce the judg
ment therein; or that they will pay to the plaintiff the amount of any
judgment which may be recovered in the action.

Sec 82. At any time before judgment, or within ten days there
after, the bail may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or he may
surrender himself to the sheriff of the county where he was arrested.

Sec 83. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the
bail, at any time or place before they are finally charged, may themselves
arrest him, or by a written authority, indorsed on a certified copy of the
undertaking, may empower the sheriff to do so. Upon the arrest of the
defendant by the sheriff, or upon his delivery to the sheriff by the
bail, or upon his own surrender the bail shall be exonerated; provided,
such arrest, delivery or surrender, take place before the expiration of ten
days after judgment; but if such arrest, delivery or surrender be not made
within ten days after judgment, the bail shall be finally charged on their
undertaking, and be bound to pay the amount of the judgment within ten
days thereafter.

Sec 84. If the bail neglect or refuse to pay the judgment within
ten days after they are finally charged, judgment against such bail for the
amount of such original judgment may be, by order of the court, upon
affidavit of such neglect or refusal, entered against the bail.

Sec 85. The bail shall also be exonerated by the death of the
defendant, or his imprisonment in a Territorial prison, or by his legal dis
charge from the obligation to render himself amenable to the process.

Sec 86. Within the time limited for that purpose the sheriff
shall file the order of arrest in the office of the clerk of the court in which
the action is pending, with his return indorsed thereon, together with a copy of the undertaking of the bail. The original undertaking he shall
retain in his possession until filed, as herein provided. The plaintiff, with
in ten days thereafter, may serve upon the sheriff a notice that he does not
accept the bail, or he shall be deemed to have accepted them, and the
sheriff shall be exonerated from liability. If no notice be served within
ten days, the original undertaking shall be filed with the clerk of the court.

Sec 87. Within five days after the receipt of notice, the sheriff
or defendant may give to the plaintiff, or his attorney, notice of the justi
fication of the same or other bail (specifying the places of residence and
occupations of the latter), before a judge of the court or district clerk, at
a specified time and place; the time to be not less than five nor more than
ten days thereafter, except by consent of parties. In case other bail be
given there shall be a new undertaking.

Sec. 88. The qualifications of bail shall be as follows:
1st. Each of them shall be a resident and householder or freeholder with
in the county.
2d. Each shall be worth the amount specified in the order of arrest, or
the amount to which the order is reduced, as provided in this chapter, over
and above all his debts and liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from
execution; but the judge or district clerk, on justification, may allow more
than two sureties to justify severally in amounts less than that expressed
in the order, if the whole justification be equivalent to that of two suffici
ent bail.

Sec 89. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail shall
attend before the judge or district clerk at the time and place mentioned
in the notice, and may be examined on oath on the part of the plaintiff,
touching his sufficiency, in such manner as the judge or clerk, in his dis
cretion, may think proper. The examination shall be reduced to writing,
and subscribed by the bail, if required by the plaintiff.

Sec 90. If the judge or clerk find the bail sufficient, he shall an
nex the examination to the undertaking, indorse his allowance thereon, and
cause them to be filed, and the sheriff shall thereupon |be exonerated from
liability.

Sec 91. The defendant may, at the time of his arrest, instead of
giving bail, deposit with the sheriff the amount mentioned in the order.
In case the amount of the bail be reduced, as provided in this chapter, the
defendant may deposit such amount instead of giving bail. In either case,
the sheriff shall give the defendant a certificate of the deposit made, and
the defendant shall be discharged out of custody.

Sec 92. The sheriff shall immediately after the deposit pay the
same into court, and take from the clerk receiving the same two certificates
of such payment, the one of which he shall deliver or transmit to the plain
tiff or his attorney, and the other to the defendant. For any default in
making such payment, the same proceedings may be had on the official
bond of the sheriff to collect the sum deposited as in other cases of delin
quency.

Sec. 93. If money be deposited, as provided in the last two sec
tions, bail may be given, and may justify upon notice at any time before
judgment; and on the filing of the undertaking and justification with the
clerk, the money deposited shall be refunded by such clerk to the defendant.

Sec. 94. Where money shall have been deposited, if it remain on
deposit at the time of a recovery of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff,
the clerk shall, under the direction of the court, apply the same in satis
faction thereof, and after satisfying the judgment shall refund the surplus,
if any, to the defendant. If the judgment be in favor of the defendant,
the clerk shall, under like direction of the court, refund to him the whole
sum deposited and remaining unapplied.

Sec. 95. If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be
rescued, the sheriff shall himself be liable as bail; but he may discharge
himself from such liability by the giving and justification of bail, at any
time before judgment.

Sec. 96. If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff, upon his
liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatisfied in whole
or in part, the same proceedings may be had, on his official bond, for the
recovery of the whole or any deficiency as in other cases of delinquency.

Sec. 97. A defendant arrested may, at any time before the justi
fication of bail, apply to the judge who made the order or the court in
which the action is pending, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff to va
cate the order of arrest, or to reduce the amount of bail. If the applica
tion be made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise,
the plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other proofs, in addition
to those on which the order of arrest was made.

Sec. 98. If upon such application it shall satisfactorily appear that
there was not sufficient cause for the arrest, the order shall be vacated; or
if it satisfactorily appear that the bail was fixed too high, the amount shall
be reduced.
Claims and Delivery of Personal Property.

Sec. 99. The plaintiff, in an action to recover the possession of
personal property, may, at the time of issuing the summons, or at any time
before answer, claim the delivery of such property to him as provided in

and for the payment to him of such sum as may, for any cause be recov

agent, and retain it in his custody. He shall also without delay serve on

arrest; and the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties
until the objection to them is either waived as above provided, or until they
justify. If the defendant except to the sureties he cannot reclaim the pro

plaintiff the defendant may, if he do not except to the sureties of the plain
tiff, require the return thereof, upon giving to the sheriff a written under

the affidavit of the plaintiff, over and above their debts and liabilities, ex

knows the contents thereof, and the same is true of his own knowledge,
except the matters therein stated on information and belief; and that, as
to those matters, he believes it to be true. When granted on the com

Sec. 221. The property mentioned in chapter thirty-seven of this
code, entitled "Of Exemptions," shall be exempt from such execution, ex

provisions of said chapter.

Sec. 222. The sheriff shall execute the writ against the property
of the judgment debtor, by levying on a sufficient amount of property, if

the other property, and paying to the plaintiff or his attorney so much of

the clerk of the court; any excess in the proceeds over the judgment and
the sheriff's fees shall be returned to the judgment debtor. When there is
more property of the judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judg

three public places of the precinct or county where the sale, is to take place,
not less than five nor more than ten days successively;

the same period in a newspaper in the county, if there be one.

Sec. 224. An officer selling without the notice prescribed by the
last section shall forfeit five hundred dollars to the aggrieved party, in
addition to his actual damages; and a person willfully taking down or
defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale or the satisfaction of the
judgment (if the judgment be satisfied before sale), shall forfeit five hundred dollars.

Sec. 225. All sales of property under execution shall be made at
auction to the highest bidder, and shall be made between the hours of nine
in the morning and five in the afternoon; after sufficient property has been
sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold. Neither the officer
holding the execution nor his deputies shall become a purchaser, or be in
terested in any purchase at such sale. When the sale is of personal pro

attend the sale, and be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the
highest price; and when the sale is of real property, and consisting of
several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately; or when a por

against any subsequent purchaser who shall refuse to pay, and the officer
may, in his discretion, thereafter reject the bid of any person so refusing.

Sec. 228. The two preceding sections shall not be construed to
make the officer liable for any more than the amount bid by the second or
subsequent purchaser, and the amount collected from the purchaser refus
ing to pay.

Sec. 229. When the purchaser of any personal property capable
of manual delivery shall pay' the purchase-money, the 'officer making the
sale shall deliver to the purchaser the property, and, if desired, shall exe

cate shall convey to the purchaser all the right, title and interest which the
debtor had in and to such property on the day the execution was levied.

Sec. 230. When the purchaser of any personal property, not
capable of manual delivery, shall pay the purchase-money, the officer

part of the property;
2. A creditor having a lien, by judgment or mortgage, on the property
sold, or on some share or part thereof, subsequent to that on which the
property was sold. The persons mentioned in the second subdivision of
this section are, in this chapter, termed redemptioners.

Sec. 233. The judgment debtor, or a redemptioner, may redeem
the property from the purchaser within six months after the sale, on paying
the purchaser the amount of his purchases, with eighteen^ per cent thereon

the purchaser may have paid thereon a'fter the purchase, and interest on
such amount; and if the purchaser be also a creditor, having a lien prior

which the said last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption by
him, with interest thereon; and the amount of any liens held by the said

order granted with or without notice, on the application of the purchaser
or the judgment creditor. But it shall not be deemed waste for the person
in possession of the property at the time of sale, or entitled to possession
afterward during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it
in the same manner in which it was previously used; or to use it in the

shall pay to the redemptioner the rents and profits he may have received
from the possession of the said premises.*

Sec. 239. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or
his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularity
in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the
judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the judgment
creditor. If the recovery be in consequence of the irregularity in the pro
ceedings concerning the sale, the judgment may, by order of the court,
upon notice to the judgment debtor, be revived, and a new execution issued

a lien on the real estate of the judgment debtor only from the time of its
revival.
Proceedings Supplementary to the Execution.

Sec. 240. When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to the

after such return is made, shall be entitled to an order from the judge of
the court, requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer concern
ing his property before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, at a
time and place specified in the order; but no judgment debtor shall be re

property of the judgment debtor, or of any one of the several debtors in the
same judgment, and upon proof by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfac

his personal services, at any time within thirty days next preceding the
order, shall not be so applied, when it shall be made to appear by the
debtor's affidavit or otherwise that such earnings are necessary for the use
of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.

Sec. 246. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor or indebted to him, claims an interest in
the property adverse to him or denies the debt, the court or judge may au
thorize, by an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor to institute
an action against such person or corporation for the recovery of such inter
est or debt; and the court or judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt, until an action can be commenced
and prosecuted to judgment. Such order may be modified or vacated by
the judge granting the same, or the court in which the action is brought,
at any time upon such terms as may be just. In addition to the remedy
provided in this and the six preceding sections, the plaintiff in any such

any part thereof, as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years; or as
entitled to the reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of such property, or
of any part thereof, after the termination of a particular estate therein;
and who, by any contingency, may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the
property, or who have an interest in any undivided share thereof as tenants
for years or for life;

whom notice shall have been given of the action for partition by publication; and

by the court; and the amount thereof, together with the fees allowed by
law to the referees, shall be apportioned among the different parties to the
action.

Sec. 283. When a lien is on an undivided interest or estate of
any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made, shall thenceforth be a
charge only on the share assigned to such party; but such share shall be
first charged with its just proportion of the costs of the partition, in prefer
ence to such lien.

Sec. 284. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold,
if there be an estate for life or years in an undivided share of the whole
property, such estate may be set off in any part of the property not ordered

priority, by payment of the sums due and to become due; the amount due
to be verified by affidavit at the time of payment;

their respective shares therein.

Sec. 286. Whenever any party to an action who holds a lien upon
the property, or any part thereof, has other securities for the payment of
the amount of such lien, the court may, in its discretion, order such securi
ties to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may
order a just deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the
property on account thereof.

Sec. 287. The proceeds of sale, and the securities taken by the
referees, or any part thereof, shall be distributed by them to the persons en
titled thereto, whenever the court so directs. But, in case no direction be
given, all such proceeds and securities shall be paid into court, or deposited
therein, or as directed by the court.

Sec. 288. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or parcels be
longing to persons who are parties to the action and who are known are
paid into court, the action may be continued, as between such parties, for
the determination of their respective claims thereto, which shall be ascertained and adjudged by the court. Further testimony may be taken in
court, or by a referee, at the discretion of the court, and the court may, if
necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by
pleadings, as in an original action.

Sec. 289. All sales of real property, made by referees under this
chapter, shall be made by public auction to the highest bidder, upon notice
