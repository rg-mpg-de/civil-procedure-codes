Sec. 125. Remedies. C. C. P., «. 1.
Remedies in the courts of justice are divided into—
(1) Actions.
(2) Special proceedings.
Legislative power. —Under sections 12 and 22, Art. IV of the Constitu
tion, the Legislature has the power to establish, limit and define the
jurisdiction of the superior courts ; to prescribe the methods of proce
dure in them, and the extent, manner, time and place of exercising
their jurisdiction ; and can declare what judgments and orders may be
given by these courts in or out of term—except that issues of fact can
be tried by a jury only in term time. Bynuui v. Powe, 97—374.
Sec. 120. Actions. C. C. P., s. 2. JSfiS-'fl, c. 277, s. 2.
An action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice,
by which a party prosecutes another party, for the enforce
ment or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of
a wrong, or the punishment or prevention of a public
offience.
Nature of action. —The proceedings under theC. C. P. are substantially
the practice and procedure of the courts of equity, and not of th
courts of common law. The only difference is that under the C. C. P.
the summons does not follow but precedes the complaint. Wilson v.
Moore, 72—558.
Probate of will. —When a will is offered for probate, the proceeding is
not a civil action, nor is it a special proceeding, but in rem, to which
" there are, strictly speaking, no parties. Hutson v. Sawyer, 104— 1.
Application for dower. —While the assignment of dower is a special pro
ceeding of which the clerk has jurisdiction, yet if any equitable element
is involved, which under the former practice would have been cogniza
ble in a court of equity, the superior court in term has jurisdiction, und
the application for dower becomes a civil action. Efland v. Efland,
96—488.
Assessment of damages for right-of-way.—An application for assessment
of damages caused by the taking of lands in the construction of rail
roads, is not, strictly speaking, either a civil action or special proceed
ing, but is a summary proceeding, of which the superior court has juris
diction in vacation or at term. The judge of the court may appoint
the appraisers either in term or vacation, while the clerk can do so only
in vacation, and then only as representing the court. Click v. Railroad,
9S—390.
Where, in such a proceeding, it was agreed that issues raised upon
the petition and answer should be transferred to the civil issue docket
for trial, whatever irregularities there may have been in the conduct of
the cause were cured, and the court had jurisdiction to proceed with and
finally determine it. Click v. Railroad, 9S—390.
Taking an administration account. —The superior court has incidental
jurisdiction to order the taking of the account of an administrator when
necessary to the rights of parties to the action. Rountree v. Britt,
94—104.
The superior court has jurisdiction concurrent with the clerk of an
action to compel an administrator to sell lands to pay debts. Wilson v.
Hynum, 92—717.
Sec. 127. Special proceedings. C. C. P., s. 3.
Every other remedy is a special proceeding.
What are Special Proceedings. —Any proceeding which, under the old
practice, might be commenced by petition or motion upon notice, is a
"Special Proceeding." Tate v. Powe, 64—644.
A "proceeding" to obtain damages for the erection of a mill is a
Special Proceeding. Sumner v. Miller, 64—688.
Also, a petition by an executor or administrator to sell lands to pay
debts. Hvman v. Jarnigau, 65—96; Badger v. Jones, 66—305: Sinclair
v. McBryde, 8S—43S.
Also, proceedings for the settlement of the estate of a deceased per
son. Hunt v. Sneed, 64— 176; Sprinkle v. Hutchinson, 66—450; Bell v.
King, 70—330; Herring v. Outlaw, 70—334.
Also, a proceeding in the nature of a creditor's bill against an execu
tor or administrator. Jerkins v. Carter, 70—500; Patterson v. Miller,
72—516. The superior court at term has also concurrent jurisdiction of
this. Haywood v. Haywood, 79—42; Shields v. Payne, So—291.
Also, a petition for dower. Felton v. Elliott, 66— 195.
Also, a petition to compel an executor or administrator to sell real
estate to pay debts. Pelletier v. Saunders, 67—261 ; Jerkins v. Carter,
A proceeding in bastardy is a Special Proceeding. State v. Slclntosb,
64—607 ; so, too, a proceeding to remove an executor. Barnes v. Brown,
79—401.
A petition for alimony alone, not coupled with a prayer for divorce, is
a Special Proceeding. Reeves v. Reeves, 82—348.
A proceeding to drain wet lands is a Special Proceeding. Durden v.
8immons, 84—555.
A proceeding for partition of lands, whether by actual division or by
sale, is a Special Proceeding, and if an issue of fact arises it is sent to
'.he superior court. Capps v. Capps, 85— 408.
A proceeding to remove an administrator is a Special Proceeding, and
the clerk has jurisdiction to find the facts. Murrill v. Sandlin, 86—54;
Simpson v. Tones, 82—323.
Partitiou is a Special Proceeding. Bragg v. Lyon, 93— 151.
Where one tenant in common has been ousted by his co-tenant, who
brings an action of ejectment to recover the possession, the superior
court has no jurisdiction to order a partition of the land. Leeper v.
Xeagle, 94—338.
What are not Special Proceedings. —A suit to recover possession of land
is not a Special Proceeding. Woodley v. Gilliam, 64—649.
Mandamus is not a Special Proceeding. Howcrton v. Tate, 66—231.
An actiou brought to correct an alleged error in the partition of land,
is a civil action , and not a Special Proceeding. Cheatham v. Crews, 81 —
343. But when there is no peculiar equitable element the remedy to
correct a mistake in the partition of land is before the clerk. Wahal v.
Smith, 82—229.
Sec.J28. 1)i vision of actions. C. C. P., s. 4.
Actions are of two kinds—
(1) Civil.
(2) Criminal.
Sec. 129. Criminal action. C. C. P., s. 5.
A criminal action is :
li) An action prosecuted by the state as a party, against
a person charged with a public offence, for the punishment
thereof.
Indictments.—Prosecutions for public offences are now defined as crimi
nal actions. State v. Lupton, 63—483.
The terms '' criminal action " and "indictment" are synonymous in
the Constitution and the C C P., and therefore it would be equally reg
ular to entitle a case, "The People v. A. B.—Criminal Action'," or
"State v. A. B.— Indictment." State v. Simons, 68—378.
(2) An action prosecuted by the state, at the instance of
an individual, to prevent an apprehended crime against
his person or property.
Peace warrants. —A proceeding upon a " peace warrant " isnowacriminal action. The judges of the superior court are invested with a large
discretion upon questions of costs in all criminal actions. State v.
Locust, 63—574.
Sec. 130. Civil action. C. C. P., s. 6.
Every other is a civil action.
Civil action. —The term "civil action " includes all causes which, under
the old practice, might have been commenced by a capias ad responden
dum, or were relievable by an ordinary bill in equity. Tate v. Powe,
64—644.
Also, an action in the nature of an old bill in equity to falsify an
account. Murphy v. Harrison, 65 —246.
Also, a suit on a guardian bond. Rowland v. Thompson, 65—1 10.
A proceeding in bastardy is a civil action, as distinguished from a crim
inal action. State v. Mcintosh, 64—607.
A suit to recover possession of land is a civil action and not a special
proceeding. Woodley v. Gilliam, 64—649.
Mandamus is not a civil action. Howerton v. Tate, 66—231.
Contra, Mandamus is now an ordinary civil action. Haymore v. Com
missioners, 85—268.
A proceeding under chapter 222, acts of i876-'77, in regard to "drain
ing wet lands," is a civil action, and returnable to the term of the supe
rior court. Bunting v. Stancil, 79— 180.
Sec. 131. Remedies not merged. C. C. P., s. 7.
Where the violation of a right admits both of a civil and
a criminal remedy, the right to prosecute the one is not
merged in the other.
Sec. 132. Definition of court ; to mean clerk, when. C. C.
P., s. 9.
In those of the following enactments which confer juris
diction or power, or impose duties, when the words "supe
rior court " or " court ' ' in reference to a superior court are
used, they mean the clerk of the superior court, unless
otherwise specially stated, or unless reference is made to a
regular term of the court, in which cases the judge of the
court alone is meant.
Means clerk. —The "superior court" in Art. IV, sec. 28 (now sec. 22),
of the state constitution does not mean the court of the clerk. McAdoo
v. Ben bow, 63—361.
Under the act of iS68-'69, chap. 1 13, enacting that an executor or
administrator may apply to the "superior court " for leave to sell land
to pay debts, the clerk of the court is referred to. Pelletier v. Saun
ders, 67—261.
The clerk implies the court in cases where he is to act for the court, or
when the statute gives discretion to the court. Tillett v. Aydlett, 90—551.
Jurisdiction really that of the court. —The jurisdiction is really that of
the superior court, the clerk being empowered to make certain orders in
vacation. Brittain v. Mull, 91 —498 ; Strayhorn v. Blaylock, 92—292.
133. Forms of civil actions ; dis- I 134. Parties designated plaintiff
tinction between actions at
and defendant,
law and suits in equity 135. Feigned issues abolished,
abolished.
Sec. 133. Forma of civil actions f distinction between actions
at law and suttstn equity abolished. C. C. P., s. 12. Const.,
Art. IV, s. 1.
The distinction between actions at law and suits in
equity, and the forms of all such actions and suits hereto
fore existing, are abolished, and there shall be hereafter
but one form of action for the enforcement or protection of
private rights, and the redress of private wrongs, which
shall be denominated a civil action.
The effect upon manner of pleading. —The essential rules of pleading at
common law have not been repealed by the C. C. P. ; they have only
been modified as to technicalities and matters of form. Parsley v. Nich
olson, 65—207.
The C. C. P. abolishes the different forms of actions and the techni
cal and artificial modes of pleading used at common law, but does not
dispense with such degree of certainty and regularity as is essential in
every system adopted for the administration of justice. Oates v. Gray,
66—442 ; Vass v. Building Association, 94—55.
The subtle science of pleading is not merely relaxed but abolished by
the C. C. P., and the forms of pleading in civil actions and the rules by
which their sufficiency are to be determined are those prescribed in the
Code. Few, if any, of the ancient rules of pleading are now applica
ble. Moore v. Edmiston, 70—510.
The effect upon the form of action. —There is now but one form of action,
and mandamus is but a process of the court in that action. Belmont v.
Reilly, 71—26. Haymore v. Commissioners, 85—268.
There is now but one form of action, and a counterclaim may be set
up by the defendant, if entitled by the Code to do so, irrespective of
whether the action arises out of a tort or contract. Bitting v. Thaxton,
72—541.
Distinction between law and equity. —The distinction between actions at
law and suits in equity is abolished as to the forms of procedure, but
the distinction between legal and equitable rights still remains. Mat
thews v. McPherson, 65—189 ; Kahnstein v. Railroad, 84—88.
Where a bill in equity for specific performance and general relief had
been dismissed under the former procedure, this is not an estoppel to an
action under the Code to recover money alleged to have been paid in
pursuance of the contract sought to be enforced. Pendleton v. Dalton,
The distinction between the principles of law and equity are not
abolished, nor are those systems blended ; only the distinctions in the
forms of procedure, and in the tribunals in which they were formerly
administered, are abrogated. Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93—22.
Distinction between actions ex contractn and ex delicto. —See Garrett v.
Trotter, 65—430; Froelich v. Southern Express Co., 67—2; Bullingerv.
Marshall, 70—520; Ashe v. Gray, 88—190.
The rule that when one person takes and sells the personal property
of another, the latter may waive the tort and recover the money,
embraces the case where the person sued received the money in conse
quence of the action of a court whose jurisdiction and process he
invoked for that purpose. Olive v. Olive, 95—485.
When the action is based upon the tortious act of the defendant, and
the damages are ascertained to be greater than fifty dollars; or where
the right to recover involves a question of title, the question of juris
diction is determined, and the plaiutiff cannot avoid it by waiving the
tort, and declaring for the value of the property alleged to have been
converted. Edwards v. Cowper, 99—421.
Where the plaintiff paid fifty dollars to the defendant upon fraudu
lent representations : field, that a justice of the peace had juris
diction of an action for the recovery of the money. Harvey v. Hambright, 98—446.
Justices of the peace have concurrent jurisdiction with the superior
courts of actions for torts where the value of the property in contro
versy does not exceed fifty dollars. Harvey v. Hambright, 98—446.
The superior court has jurisdiction of an action for damages for the
conversion of property where the amount claimed is one hundred and
twenty-five dollars. Asher v. Reizenstein, 105—213.
A complaint alleging that the defendant, a common carrier, failed to
safely carry certain articles of freight according to contract, and "so
negligently and carelessly conducted in regard to the same that it was
greatly damaged," states facts sufficient to constitute a tort. Bowers v.
Railroad, 107—721.
Sec. 134. Parties designated plaintiff and defendant.
c. c. p., s. 1s.
In such action, the party complaining shall be known as
the plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant.
Sec. 135. Feigned issues abolished. C. C. P., s. 15.
Feigned issues are abolished; and instead thereof, in the
cases where the power formerly existed to order a feigned
issue, or when a question of fact not put in issue by the
pleadings is to be tried by a jury, an order for the trial
may be made by the judge, stating distinctly and plainly
the question of fact to be tried; and such order shall be
the only authority necessary for a trial.
Fictitious proceedings. —The fictitious proceedings of the old action of
ejectment is abolished. Harkey v. Houston, 65—137.
Feigned issues. —An action upon a feigned issue should be dismissed
by the court ex mero mottt. Blake v. Askew, 76-325.
136. To what actions this title 138. Period of limitation—objecshall extend.
tion must be taken by au137. Time between the 20th of
swer.
May, 1861, and 1st January,
1870, not to be counted.
Sec. 136. To what actions this title shall extend. C. C. P.,
#. 16.
This title shall not extend to actions commenced before
the twenty-fourth day of August, one thousand eight hun
dred and sixty-eight, nor to cases where the right of action
accnted before that date, but the statutes in force previous
to that date shall be applicable to such actions and cases.
Note.—By chapter 1 13, Acts 1891, sections 136 and 137 are repealed ;
the repeal, however, not to apply to any action instituted prior to Janu
ary 1, 1893. The effect is to make the application of the statutes of limi
tations contained in the Code unifoxm as to all causes of action whenever
accrued, and to eliminate hereafter the time excepted in section 137,
except as to causes of action accruing prior to the adoption of the
C C P., upon which suit shall be brought before January 1, 1893. The
following amendment was adopted in 1889, and may hereafter be prop
erly numbered lection 136 :
On the trial of any action or special proceeding to which
an insane person has been made a party, such insane per
son shall be deemed to have pleaded specially any defence,
and shall on trial have the benefit of any defence, whether
pleaded or not, that might have been made for him by his
guardian or attorney under the provisions of title three of
the Code of Civil Procedure, section one hundred and
thirty-six to section one hundred and seventy-six of The
Code of North Carolina, both inclusive. And the court, at
any time before the action or proceeding is finally disposed
of, may order the bringing in, by proper notice, of one or
more of the near relatives or friends of such insane person,
and may make such other order or orders as it may deem
necessary for his proper defence. Acts 1889, chap. 89.
Right of action accruing before the C. C. P. —A right of action which
accrued before the adoption of the Code is governed by the statutes of
limitation then in force. Williams v. Williams, 70—189 ; Knight v.
Braswell, 70—709; Libbett v. Maultsby, 71—345; Woodhouse v Sim
mons, 73-*-30 ; Barham v. Lomax, 73—76 ; Ellis v. Scott, 75—108 ; Cov
ington v. Stewart, 77—148 ; Batts v. Winstead, 77—238 ; Johnston v.
Parke, 79—475 ; Blue v. Gilchrist, 84—239 ; White v. Beaman, 85—3 ;
Hall v. Gibbs, 87—4 ; Crawford v. McLellan, 87—169.
When the cause of action occurred before the 24th August, 1868,
the statute of limitation in force before that time applies. Phipps v.
Pierce, 94—514.
An executor or administrator cannot avail himself of the limita
tions prescribed in sections 11 and 12, chap. 65 of Rev. Code, unless he
shows that he has disposed of the assets and made the advertisement
required by sections 24 and 27, chap. 46, Rev. Code. Glover v. Flowers,
95—57.
Where a clerk and master, in the years 1855 and 1858, received moneys
arising from the sale of lands for partition, under a decree of the court
of equity, but no demand was made or proceedings instituted by the
parties entitled to receive them until the year 1880 ; the statutory pre
sumption of payment or satisfaction, must prevail. Kerlee v. Corpeni"g. 97—33°The statute of presumption of payment, and not the statute of limi
tations, is applicable to an action on an administration bond executed in
1859 and for a breach prior to August 24, 1868, and the action being
brought within ten years, and judgment given, with the intervention of
less than a year after nonsuit, the plea of the statute cannot avail a
surety. Wilson v. Pearson, 102—290.
Interest on causes of action arising prior to C. C. P. —The same rule applies
with regard to interest accruing upon such a cause of action. Knight
v. Braswell, 70—709.
Judgments on causes of actions arising prior to C. C. P. —A judgment
obtained in 1870 on a debt contracted before 1868 is subject to the provisions of this title whenever such judgment becomes itself causa litis.
McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248.
A judgment rendered before, though docketed after, the adoption of
C. C. P., is not subject to the limitations of this statute, but to a pre
sumption of satisfaction. Johnston v. Jones, 87-393.
A judgment quando (unlike a final judgment) founded upon a right
of action that accrued before said date, is not a new cause of action,
and hence, a suit upon it is governed by the statute of limitations and
the law in force prior thereto. Gaither v. Sain, 91-304.
There was no statute of limitations barring actions upon notes under
seal executed, or judgments rendered, prior to 1868. A presumption of
payment arose after ten years. Glover v. Flowers, 95-57.
In an action begun under the former practice, in which the judgment
was rendered since the adoption of the present system, an application
to set aside the judgment as irregular should be made in the same
manner as if the action had been commenced since the adoption of the
Code of Civil Procedure. Knott v. Taylor, 99-511.
The seven years limitation prescribed by Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. n,
was applicable-only to demands against the debtor in his life-time, but
when such claims were reduced to judgment, they became merged
therein, and there was no statute of limitation against proceedings for
its enforcement, either against the personal or real estate of the dece
dent. After the expiration of ten years a presumption of payment
arose. Lee v. Deaman, 101-294.
Presumption of payment. —Although when a bond payable to a guar
dian is endorsed by him to a third party, the endorsee is barred by the
lapse of three years, this is not so as to the ward (when the cause of
action accrued prior to 1868) who is the beneficial owner of the bond.
Usry v. Suit, 91-406.
The statute, Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 18, declaring a presumption of
payment after ten years, embraced bonds or " single bills " as well as
promissory notes and other demands therein designated. Rogers v.
Clements,*o8-i8o.
Section 18, ch. 65, Rev. Code, was not a statute of limitation, but only
raised a presumption of payment, which might be at any time rebutted
by proof that the bond had not been paid. Currie v. Clark, 101-320.
To a cause of action for converting an absolute deed into a security,
arising prior to the adoption of the existing statutes of limitations,
there was no time prescribed as a bar, but the ten years' statute of pre
sumption—Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 19—is applicable. Summerlin v.
Cowles, 101-473.
The statute (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. iS) which declares judgments,
decrees, etc., shall be presumed to be satisfied within ten years, is not
conclusive. In re v. Walker, 107-340.
Rebuttal of presumption. —When a bond, executed by two obligors, is
presumed to be paid by the lapse of time, the separate declaration of
one of the obligors is not competent to rebut the presumption as to the
other, nor even to charge the party making it, unless it is shown that
the other had not made payment. Clements v. Rogers, 92-81.
Evidence that the plaintiff asked payment of a debt from the defend
ant, and that the defendant acknowledged that he owed something, and
gave the plaintiff some property to be applied to the debt, which was
entered as a credit on the bond sued on, is some evidence, taken with
other circumstances, to rebut the presumption of pavment from the lapse
of time, although there is no evidence that at the time plaintiff was the
owner of the bond sued on. White v. Beaman, 96-122.
The admission by one obligor in a bond that the debt has not been paid, will not rebut the presumption of payment in favor of the other
obligors ; nor will the naked admission of the obligor sought to be
charged have that effect, as the presumption of payment by the other
obligors still remains. The presumption against the obligor sought to be
charged is not rebutted by the recovery of judgment by default against
his co-obligor within ten years. Rogers v. Clements, 98-180.
An endorsement by a maker of a promissory note, "January 26, 1884,
renewed, T. A. Osborne," is sufficient to rebut the presumption of pay
ment as to a note executed prior to 1868, if he had capacity to under
stand the nature and consequences of his acts. Morris v. Osborne,
104-609.
In an action against the principal obligor in a bond executed prior to
1868, his admission that neither he nor his surety have paid the bond,
is sufficient to rebut the presumption of payment, nothing else appear
ing. Cartwright v. Kerman, 105-1.
If insolvency of the obligor is relied upon to rebut the presumption of
payment arising from the lapse of time, it must be shown to have existed
continuously during the entire statutory period. Alston v. Hawkins,
105-3Where, in a former action in which the same instrument was in con
troversy, the administrator of the maker did not deny the allegation that
the bond had not been paid, upon the trial of a subsequent action, in
which the question of payment was an issue, the record of this admission
could be read as evidence to rebut the presumption of payment. Grant
v. Gooch, 105-278.
Ordinarily, evidence to rebut the statute of presumptions ought to
embrace the whole period. Grant v. Gooch, 105-27S.
When there is no administration. —When more than ten years have elapsed
since the right of action arose, but during a period of that time there
was 110 personal representative of the creditor who could sue, or of the
debtor who could be sued, whether such portion of time must be left out
of the computation of time during which the statute was running, qucere.
Tucker v. Baker, 94-162.
Where a debtor died after the bond was due and the presumption had
begun to run, and no administration was had on his estate for some'
years, the time during which there was no administration must be
eliminated, and only the time during which there was a person in esse
to sue could be counted in computing the ten years. Long v. Clegg,
94-763Note.—In these cases the cause of action accrued prior to the C. C. P.
Where it has accrued since, The Code, sec. 164, applies, which see with
decisions there cited.
Administrations. —Prior to the enactment of the statute (now The Code,
sec. T433), there was no statutory bar to proceedings against the heir to
subject descended lands to the payment of the ancestor's debts. In this
respect the administration of estates before July, 1869, is governed by the
law then in force. Glover v. Flowers, 101-134.
The original administration of an estate having been granted before
July, 1869, a creditor could bring suit against the personal and real repre
sentatives and have an account taken, so that a decree should be rendered
against the one or the other as in equity entitled. Wilson v. Pearson,
102-290.
Where an administrator qualified in 1S62 and died in 1869, and an
administrator de bonis non was appointed in 1886, the estate must be set
tled according to the law as it stood before July 1st, 1869.
Guardian and administration bonds executed prior to C. C. P. —Where an
administration bond was executed prior, but the breach assigned is sub
sequent, to the C C P., this chapter applies. Vaughan v. Hines, 87-445.
Where the guardian qualified before the C C P., and the ward became
of age after The Code, the action for non-payment by the guardian is
governed by the C C P. Briggs v. Smith, 83-306.
Owelty of partition. —A decree in proceedings for partition had in 1861,
adjndging owelty of partition against certain shares of the land divided,
is subject to the statute of presumptions (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 18),
providing that " the presumption of payment, satisfaction of all judg
ments, decrees," etc., * * * "shall arise within ten years after the right
of action shall have accrued." Herman v. Watts, 107-646; In re Walker,
107-340.
Mortgagor and mortgagee. —Where the mortgagor remained in posses
sion over ten years after the condition of the mortgage was broken,
there arose a presumption of the payment of said debts, and the legal
estate vested in the mortgagor under Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 19. Pemberton v. Simmons, 100-316.
When mortgaged land is not in the actual possession of either mort
gagor or mortgagee, the title remains undisturbed as fixed in the deed
of mortgage, and the statutory presumption (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 19)
does not arise to the prejudice of either. Simmons v. Ballard, 102-105.
Femes covert and infants. —The statute (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sees. 18, 19)
was enacted to quiet controversies and prevent the presentation of stale
demands, and contains no saving clause or exception in favor of infants
or femes covert. Mull v. Walker, 100-46 : Hamlin v. Mebane, 54-18 ;
Hodges v. Council, 86-181; Headen v. Womack, 88-468.
While there is no saving provision in favor of women under disability
of coverture contained in the statute (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 19) raising
a presumption of an abandonment of equitable interests after the lapse of
ten years, yet when the period there prescribed is adopted by the courts, in
the exercise of their equitable jurisdiction, as the one in which the action
must be brought, by analogy to the general statutes of limitations, the
time during which such disability existed will not be computed. Summerlin v. Cowles, 101-473.
Sec. 137. Time between the 20th of May, 1861, and Janu
ary, 1st, 1870, not to be counted. 1806-'7, c. 17, s. 8.
1873-'4, c. 34, s. 5.
The time between the twentieth day of May, one thou
sand eight hundred and sixty-one, and the first day of
January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, shall
not be counted, so as to bar actions or suits, or to presume
satisfaction or abandonment of rights.
Note i. —This section is repealed as to all actions which shall not be
instituted before January 1, 1893. Chapter 113, Acts 1891.
Note 2,—The following probably should be inserted as a new sec
tion (137) by substitution :
An act to compel personal representatives to plead the stat
utes of limitations. Chapters 92 a nd 356, 1891.
It shall be the duty of personal representatives to plead
the bar of the statutes of limitations as a defence to all
actions against them in their representative capacity when
such defence may be available, except when the claimant
has foreborne to sue at the instance of the administrator
or the executor and for the benefit of the estate, and if the
personal representative shall fail in good faith to insist
upon such defence then the heirs or devisees shall have, in
any proceedings to subject the lands of a devisor or dece
dent to make assets, the right to plead that the action was
barred when judgment was entered against the executor or
administrator; and if it be found that the action was barred
when the judgment was so rendered against such personal
representative, license shall not be granted to sell the land
belonging to the estate to satisfy such claim only, nor shall
any part of the proceeds of the sale of the land be applied
to the satisfaction of such claim : Provided, that in any case
if the heirs at law or distributees of any estate or their legal
representatives shall concur, then the administrator may
not plead the statutory bar if they shall believe that the
debt or claim is bona fide and just. This act shall not
apply to any action now pending, or debt or claim on which
suit shall be brought on or before January the first, eighteen
hundred and ninety-two.
The suspension applies. —The time between May 20th, 1S61, and January
ist, 1870, is not to be counted in ascertaining the period necessary to
have elapsed in order to bar an action. Johnson v. Winslow, 63-552 ;
Howell v. Buie, 64-446; Plott v. Railroad Co., 65-74; Smith v. Rogers,
65-181; Williams v. Williams, 70-189 ; Faison v. Bowden, 74-43 ; Edwards
v. Jarvis, 74-315 ; Hawkins v. Savage, 75-133 ; Lippard v. Troutman, 72551; Bruner v. Threadgill, 88-361; Badger v. Daniel, 79-372; Johnson
v. Parker, 79-475.
To prevent an action abating by the death of either party. Morris v.
Avery, 61-238.
To give widows further time for dissenting. Hinton v. Hinton, 61-410.
To the presumption of a grant by twenty years' possession of an ease
ment. Benbow v. Robbins, 71-338.
To the presumptiou of title from seven years' adverse possession of
land under color. Melvin v. Waddell, 75-361; Kitchen v. Wilson, 80191; Johnson v. Parker, 79-475; Logan v. Fitzgerald, 87-308.
Where a single bond was executed in 1860, and more than ten years,
exclusive of time between May, 1861, and January, 1870, had elapsed
before the bringing of an action upon it, there is a presumption of pay
ment or satisfaction thereof. Grant v. Gooch, 105-278.
Tie suspension of the statute does not apply. —To actions on contracts
where the contract was made since May 1, 1865. This doctrine is inti
mated in Lippard v. Troutman, 72-551, and decided in Edwards v.
Jams, 74-315 ; Hawkins v. Savage, 75-133 ; Lane v. Richardson, 79-159;
Pearsall v. Kenan, 79-472 ; Austin v. Dawson, 75-523 ; Cannon v. Mor
ris, 81-139.
Nor to prevent judgments becoming dormant. Neeley v. Craige,
61-187.
Defendants entered into adverse possession of land in 1856, in the
life-timeof plaintiffs' ancestor, and held such possession up to the com
mencement of this action, in 1887. Plaintiffs' ancestor died in 1862, at
which time plaintiffs were under disabilities, and they have remained
under disabilities all the time : Held, that plaintiffs are barred by the
statute. The suspension of the statute from May, 1861, to January, 1870,
does not place plaintiffs on the same footing as if the statute had been
refvaUd in 1861, and therefore, only commenced to run in 1870, after the
death of their ancestor and while they were under disabilities ; but
plaintiffs stand in the same position as would their ancestor, if living.
Chancey v. Powell, 103-159.
The statute of 1869-70. —The statute of 1869-'70 suspending the statute
of limitations till the falling in of the reversionary estate in the land
embraced by the homestead, applies only where the homestead has been
actually allotted, and only to judgments docketed in the county where
the homestead is situate. McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248 ; Cotton v.
McClenahan, 85-254.
Legislative power. —The Legislature can repeal the effect of the statute
of limitations before it operates, and probably even after. Pearsall v.
Kenan, 79-472. Compare Taylor v. Harrison, 31-374, and Phillips
v. Cameron, 48-390.
The Legislature can repeal the statute of limitations before it becomes
a bar but not afterwards. Whiteburst v. Dey, 90-542.
Sec. 138. Period of limitation—objection must be taken by
answer. C. C. P., s. 17.
Civil actions can only be commenced within the periods
prescribed in this title, after the cause of action shall have
accrued, except where in special cases a different limitation
is prescribed by statute. But the objection that the action
was not commenced within the time limited, can only be
taken by answer.
Objection must be taken by answer, —Pegram v. Stoltz, 67-144 ; Privett v.
Calloway, 75-233 ; Green v. Railroad Co. , 73-524; Kahnweiler v. Ander
sou, 78-133; Long v. Bank, 81-41 ; Andres v. Powell, 97-155.
The Code requires the statute of limitations to be specially pleaded,
and no distinction is made between legal and equitable causes of action
in this respect. Guthrie v. Bacon, 107-337.
Under the former practice in equity, advantage could be taken of
lapse of time without plea, where it appeared upon the face of the
pleadings that the cause of action was barred ; but now there must be a
plea in all cases, whether of an equitable or legal nature. Randolph v.
Randolph, 107-506.
Objection cannot be taken by demurrer. —The statute of limitations must
be pleaded as a defence in the answer, and cannot be set up by demur
rer. Bason v. Berry, 85-124.
Nor by motion to dismiss or vacate. —The defence of the statute of limi
tations must be set up in the answer, and cannot be assigned as reason
for a motion to dismiss. Lynn v. Lowe, 88-478.
Nor can it be set up by a motion to vacate and set aside an execution.
Williams v. Mullis, 87-159.
If not relied on in the lower court. — If the plea of the statute is not relied
on in the trial before a justice, it cannot be set up on appeal in the supe
rior court without leave. Permission to do so is a matter of discretion
with the judge. Poston v. Rose, 87-279.
Defendant will not be allowed to plead it, when. —A defendant will not be
allowed to plead the statute of limitations when the action has been
delayed at his request. Daniel v. Commissioners, 74-494 ; Haymore v.
Commissioners, 85-268 ; Barcroft v. Roberts, 91-363.
Creditors' bill. —In an action in the nature of a creditor's bill, even
creditor may plead the statute against the claim of every other. Woodsworth v. Davis, 75-159.
Must be proven. —When the objection that the action has not been com
menced within the time limited is taken, it must be proved, if not
apparent from the complaint, by the party seeking advantage from itLewis v. Latham, 74-283; Strauss v. Crawford, 89-149.
When it need not be set up in answer. —Where defendant claims under a
grant from the state, the thirty years' possession can be given in evi
dence without pleading the statute of limitations. Freeman v. Sprague,
82-366.
The statute of presumptions need not to be pleaded. —It is sufficient if the
facts appear in the answer from which the presumption will arise.
Crawford v. McLellan, 87-169.
On running accounts. —Where there is a running account all on one side,
the statute of limitations runs on each item from its date. Where there
are mutual accounts, the statute runs only from the last dealing between
the parties. Robertson v. Pickrell, 77-302 ; Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394.
Optional with administrator or executor. —While an administrator, in his
discretion, may or may not plead the statute of limitation, he cannot
waive his intestate's discharge in bankruptcy, since the latter extin
guishes the debt. Parker v. Grant, 91-338.
Note. —Executors and administrators are now required to plead the
statute of limitatious, if available, in all actions begun after January 1,
1892. Acts 189r, chapters 92 and 356.
Sec. ISO. When the state will not sue, thirty yearn' posses
sion. C. C. P., s. IS.
The state will not sue any person for, or in respect of, any
real property, or the issues or profits thereof, by reason of
the right or title of the state to the same :
(1) When the person in possession thereof, or those under
whom he claims, shall have been in the adverse possession
thereof for thirty years, such possession having been ascer
tained and identified under known and visible lines or
boundaries, shall give a title in fee to the possessor.
Nature of possession requisite. —Discussed. Logan v. Fitzgerald, 87-308.
What adverse possession is sufficient. —Where a party ran a fence across
the neck of a peninsula, partly on his own land and partly on another's,
and opened a gap on his own land so as to allow his own cattle to go on
the peninsula and exclude others, unless they crossed the river, this is
not an adverse possession, unless the fence was made with the avowed
purpose of taking possession of the peninsula. Osborne v. Johnson,
65-22.
If there has been an adverse possession for any time less than thirty
years, it is not a circumstance to go to the jury from which alone, or with
other circumstances, to infer thirty years' adverse possession. Melvin
v. Waddell, 75-361.
Where a widow puts a son-in-law in possession of land belonging to
the estate of her deceased husband, and he sells and makes title in fee,
having none himself, neither his possession, nor that of those claiming
under him, is adverse to the heirs of the husband, or those claiming title
under them. Ibid.
No privity among successive tenants formerly necessary. —From an adverse
possession of land for thirty years, the law presumes a grant from the
state, and it is not even necessary that there should be privity or connec
tion among the successive tenants. Candler v. Lunsford, 20-447 ; Melvin v. Waddell, 75-361 ; Davis v. McArthur, 78-367 ; Cowles v. Hall, 90330 ; Dills v. Hampton, 92-565 ; Davidson v. Arledge, 97-172 ; Pearson
v. Simmons, 98-281.
A break in possession formerly immaterial. —A break of two or three years
in the chain of possession for thirty years, necessary to show title out of
the state, is immaterial. Cowles v. Hall, 90-330 ; Mallett v. Simpson,
94-37.
Contra. —Adverse possession must be continnous. A gap, occurring
even during the period the statute was suspended, will destroy its con
tinuity. The possession must be actual, open and visible and not an
assertion of a mere claim, as, for instance, by the payment of taxes.
Malloy v. Bruden, 86-251.
Under the present statute. —Thirty years' adverse possession, which was
formerly held to be a presumption of a grant is now by statute an abso
lute bar against the state. But in such case the plaintiff must show
privity between him and those preceding him in possession, and also that
the possession was held up to known and visible boundaries. Price v.
Jackson, 91-11.
Under the law formerly in force, a grant from the state was presumed
after an adverse possession of the land for thirty years; and it was not
necessary that the possession should be continnous or that there should
be connection or privity among the successive occupants. This is now
altered by this subsection, and there must now be privity between suc
cessive occupants aud continnous adverse possession up to known and
visible bounds. Phipps v. Pierce, 94-514.
What plaintiff must show. —In an actiou to recover land the plaintiff
must recover upon the strength of his own title ; and it is incumbent on
him to show a grant from the state, or possession sufficiently long to pre
sume a grant, or that the defendant is estopped to deny his title. —Graybeal v. Davis, 95-508.
In an action to recover land, the plaintiff may establish his title to the
locus in qno ; (1) by showing a grant from the state, and a regular chain
to himself ; (2) by showing that he and those under whom he claims
have had possession under known and visible boundaries for thirty years ;
(3) by showing a possession of twenty-one years under color of title
(which would be good against the state), and (4) by showing title out of
the state and continnous adverse possession under color. Pearson v.
Simmons 98-281 ; Mobley v. Griffin, 104-112.
Where the plaintiff showed possession in himself and those under
whom he claimed, from 1820 to 1886, aud a deed to himself, under a
judicial sale, dated in December, 1872, but did not show title out of the
state, he was entitled to recover—the defendant showing no title what
ever. Pearso:: v. Simmons, 98-281.
In ejectment a plaintiff may show title in himself, as follows :
(1) By a connected chain from the State.
(2) By showing title out of the State and that his title matured by
seven years' adverse possession under color of title, by himself or those
under whom he claims, before bringing his action.
(3) By showing possession for twenty-one years under color of title,
in which case he need not prove title out of the State.
(4) By showing defendant to have been his tenant when the actiou
was commenced, and thus establish his title by estoppel. Conwell v.
Mann, 100-234.
Defendant need not plead the thirty years' possession. —Where the defendant
claims under a grant from the state, his thirty years' possession can be
given in evidence without pleading the statute of limitations. Freeman
v. Sprague, 82-366.
Where both parties claim title from the same source. —Where both parties
claim title to the land in controversy from the same source it is not
necessary for either to prove title beyond that source. Ferebee v. Hiuton, 102-99.
Where the plaintiff shows from the deeds offered, or the admission in
the pleadings, that both claim from a common source, he is required
only to exhibit a better title in himself derived from it than that of the
defendant, in order to establish prima facie his right of recovery. Bonds
v. Smith, 106-554.
When both parties claim under the same owner it is not necessary to
show title out of the State. . Cox v. Ward, 107-507.
Twenty-one years' possession under colorable title.
(2) When the person in possession thereof, or those under
whom he claims, shall have been in possession under col
orable title for twenty-one years, such possession having
been ascertained and identified under known and visible
lines or boundaries.
See Malloy v. Bruden, under preceding subsection.

Where the plaintiff failed to connect himself with the former owners
of a tract of land, and failed to show color of title or adverse and con
tinuous possession for twenty-one years : Held, that the court properly
instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. Brown v.
King, 107-313.
Sec. HO. Such possession valid against claimants under
the state. C. C. P., 8. 10.
All such possession as is described in the preceding sec
tion, under such title as is therein described, is hereby rati
fied and confirmed, and declared to be a good and legal bar
against the entry or suit of any person, under the right or
claim of the state.
Sec. 141. Seven years' possession under colorable title—
when persons having title must sue. C. C. P., s. 20.
When the person in possession of any real property, or
those under whom he claims, shall have been possessed of
the same, under known and visible lines and boundaries,
and under colorable title for seven years, no entry shall be
made or action sustained against such possessor by any per
son having any right or title to the same, except during
the seven years next after his right or title shall have
descended or accrued, who in default of suing within the
time aforesaid, shall be excluded from any claim thereafter
to be made ; and such possession, so held, shall be a per
petual bar against all persons, subject to the qualifications
in sections 148, 149, 150.
What possession will protect. —Seven years' exclusive adverse possession
of land under color of title will protect the occupant against the claim
of the true owner. Davis v. McArthur, 7S-357 ; Johnson v. Parker,
79-475 ; unless such owner be under some disability, and in that event,
his right must be asserted within three years from the removal of the
disability. Johnson v. Parker, 79-475.
A purchaser of land who has been in the continuous adverse posses
sion under a deed for the same for more than seven years before suit
brought (and after cause of action accrued) in an action to have such
purchaser declared a trustee for plaintiff's benefit is protected by this
section, and the fact that an ejectment was brought within the time is
no defence to the pica of the statute. The two actions are not for the
same cause. Isler v. Dewey, S4-345.
Where title is shown out of the state by thirty years' possession the
plaintiff need not show seven years' adverse possession in addition to
the thirty years to entitle him to recover. The lapse of the seven years' adverse possession concurrently with the thirty years is sufficient. Hill
v. Overton, 81-393.
Where A, having a life-estate, conveys to B in fee, who conveys to C,
the reversioner or remainderman does not have a right of action until
the death of the life-tenant. At his death the possession becomes
adverse, and will ripen into a good title by seven years' possession, the
title being out of the state. Staton v. Mullis, 92-623.
Where the defendant was in actual possession of a part of the locus
in quo and had constructive possession of the rest, and the true owner,
the plaintiff, enters upon the part of which the possession was construc
tive, such entry at once vests the possession in him, and seven years
must elapse from such entry, before the defendant can acquire title by
lapse of time. Logan v. Fitzgerald, 92-644.
A person holding possession of land for himself in 185s, executed a
mortgage and in 1S59 assigned his equity of redemption to the mort
gagee, but continued in possession ; and the mortgagee sold and con
veyed the land, in 1872, to a third party, who entered and held posses
sion until 1878, when this suit was commenced : Held, 1st. That the
mortgagor became tenant at sufferance of his grantee ; 2d. That, the
defendant, and those under whom he claims, having had actual adverse
possession, under known and visible metes and bounds of the land in
controversy, with color of title, the action would have been barred, if
it had been brought by the plaintiff's grantor, or his heirs and there
fore this action, which was brought by the heirs of the grantee, was
barred. Johnson v. Prairie, 94-773.
A purchaser at a judicial sale of the lands of a decedent, and holding
under a deed from the commissioner, which purports to convey the
entire interest in the land, is protected by his adverse possession for
seven years, against any of the heirs, not under disability, though they
were not made parties to the proceedings. And so it would have been
if the deed had been executed by a stranger. McCulloch v. Daniel,
102-529.
Possession by the bargainee, open, continued and adverse, of part of
a tract of land covered by deed, is possession of all of the tract not
occupied by some one else, and such possession, continued for seven
years, will ripen into title. Allen v. Sallinger, 103-14.
One J. went into possession of a tract of land in 1873, under a bond
for title, which he assigned to plaintiffs, who took in 1874, and con
tinued until 1S81 or 1882, deed being made to them in 1S75, conveying
to them by metes and bounds. The possession of both was adverse and
continuous, and the title was good against all persons but the state.
Brown v. Brown, 106-451.
Though a grant offered by a plaintiff be void, he may avail himself
of another introduced by the defendant to show title out of the state,
and establish his own title by proving possession under color for seven
years subsequent to the date of" the latter grant. Gilchrist v. Middleton,
107-663.
Nature of possession required. —The nature of the possession irecessary
under this section commented on. Malloy v. Brudeii, 86-251; Logan v.
Fitzgerald, 87-30S ; Gudger v. Hensley, S2-481.
Building a shed, quarrying rock and cutting wood to burn lime on
the premises for more than seven years, uninterruptedly, constitutes an
adverse possession which will give title to one claiming under it. Moore
v. Thompson, 69-120.
The possession for seven years under color of title must be continuous,
uninterrupted and manifested by distinct and unequivocal acts of own
ership to bar the entry of the real owner. Gudger v. Hensley, 82-481.
In proving continuous adverse possession under color of title, nothing
must be left to conjecture. The testimony, if believed, must show the
continuity of the possession for the full statutory period in plain terms,
or by necessary implication. Ruffin v. Overby, 105-78.
Possession essential to establish color of title must be open, notorious,
adverse and continuous for seven years. Cox v. Ward, 107-507.
Where, in an action to recover land, the defendants show adverse pos
session under color of title for seven years, under known and visible
lines and boundaries, continuous and successive, and next preceding the
institution of this action, the plaintiffs cannot recover. Simpson v.
Simpson, 107-552.
In a deed conveying a tract of land, the grantor reserved to himself
the right to manage the entire farm and make such changes or improve
ments upon the buildings as he chose, so that it did not deprive the
grantee of a home, and remained on the land erecting buildings and
collecting rents, a portion of which he paid to the grantee, who also
resided on the premises : Held, (1) that such possession was not adverse
to the grantee ; (2) that the possession of the grantor being that of the
grantee, it was sufficient, if continued for the statutory period, to ripen
a color of title under an unregistered deed and maintain an action for
the recovery of possession against a subsaquent purchaser from the
grantor. Turner v. Williams, 108-210.
Not sufficient as possession. —Occasional entries at long intervals for
seven years under color of title for the purpose of making brick, cutting
timber, etc., will not entitle a plaintiff to recover laud under this section.
The possession must be continuous and actual, not constructive. Wil
liams v. Wallace, 78-354.
Occasional acts of ownership, however clearly they may indicate a
purpose to claim title and exercise dominion over the land, do not con
stitute a possession that will mature title. Ruffin v. Overby, 105-78.
A recovery is not barred by the possession for seven years, unless
adverse. liouds v. Smith, 106-554.
NoTK. —See cases cited under preceding section as to nature and suffi
ciency of possession required.
Possession by two. —In case of the common possession by two persons,
the ownership draws to it the possession, and it is presumed to be in him
who has the title. So, where a ward resided with his guardian on a
tract of land in which he had an interest as tenant in common, his pos
session is presumed to be in accordance with his title, and there is no
adverse possession as against him. Gaylord v. Respass, 92-553.
Possession by mortgagor. —The possession of the mortgagor cannot be
adverse to the mortgagee, but a purchaser for value from the mortgagor,
without notice of the mortgagee, holding possession for seven years,
acquires a good title. Parker v. Bauks, 79-4S0.
Possession by mortgagee. —A seven years' adverse possession under a
mortgage deed is not color of title, but the mortgagee's actual posses
sion of the land for ten years after default raises a presumption of a
release of the equity of redemption, or of a reconveyance if such posses
sion is by the mortgagor. Edwards v. Lipton, 85-479.
Possession by one tenant in common. —Though a tenant in common has
been in the sole reception of the profits for more than seven years, yet
his possession can not be held as adverse to his co-tenant's without proof
of actual ouster. Linker v. Benson, 67-150; McGill v. Buie, 106-242.
Nothing less than a sole possession of twenty years by a co-tenant
without any demand or claim of another co-tenant to rents, profits or
possession, he being under no disability, will raise a presumption in law
that such sole possession is rightful. Day v. Howard, 73-1 ; Neely v.
Neely, 79-478 ; Covington v. Stewart, 77-148 ; Hicks v. Bullock, 96-164.
If a tenant in common is the possessor under a title independent of
the common title, it seems that a possession for seven years will bar his
co-tenants. Gaylord v. Respass, 92-553.
The bare occupation of one tenant in common of lands and the undis
puted use thereof by him under a title purporting to convey the entire
"estate for seven years, is not such an adverse possession as will bar the
other tenants. To have such an effect the possession must be for twenty
years. If the tenants, not in possession, had asserted their claim and
been resisted, and thereafter the occupant had been permitted to remain
in possession for seven years, his possession would be deemed adverse
and his title would have ripened against his co-tenants. Breeden v.
McLaurin, 98-307.
When one who takes a deed from an alleged lunatic, and goes into the
possession of the laud described, would have been one of the heirs of the
property in the absence of the deed, his possession is adverse from the
delivery of the deed, and the statutory bar of seven years is applicable in
his favor against those who would have been tenants in common with
him. Ellington v. Ellington, 103-54.
A deed from the administrator is color of title. Twenty years' adverse
and exclusive possession under it would protect against claims of tenants
in common, but the time between May 20, 1861 and January 1, 1S70,
should not be counted. McMillan v. Ganibill, 106-359.
In an action to recover land, the plaintiff claimed as owner in fee.
The defendant claimed as tenant in common with plaintiff of an undi
vided third. Plaintiff's evidence, sufficient to show ownership in fee, in
an undivided part of the land, tended also to show color of title and con
tinuous possession of the whole land. Defeudant also offered evidence
tendiug to show color of title in an undivided third, and possession for
more than seven years. This the court refused to receive, and instructed
the jury that defendant had failed to offer any evidence of co-tenancy :
Held, to be error. The burden is upon the plaintiffs to show sole titles
themselves, as alleged, and failing in this, the defendant has a right to
remain in possessiou as tenant in common with them of the undivided
one-third. Lenoir v. Mining Co., 106-473.
The sole reception of the profits byone tenant in common of land, or
by his bargainee, under a deed purporting to convey the whole interest
for any period less than twenty years, is not an ouster, nor is the verbal
refusal to let his co-teuants in, for a greater interest than such co-tenant
is entitled to hold, an ouster. Gilchrist v. Middleton, 107-663.
See citations under i}. 143 and 144, post.
Possession by alienee of a tenant in common. —An action by one tenant in
common for partition is not barred by seven years' adverse possessiou
by an alienee of the other tenant in common under a deed purporting
to convev the whole land, unless there was an actual ouster. Pope v.
Mathis, S3-169; Caldwell v. Neely, 81-114.
One tenant in common cannot make his possession adverse to his
co-tenant except by actual ouster, as he is presumed to hold by his true
title, and it will take a sole possession of twenty years in the absence of
actual ouster to bar the co-tenant's right of entry, and it is immaterial
that the tenant in possession has conveyed to a stranger by a deed -pur
porting to convey the entire estate, as the vendee only gets such estate
as his vendor could convey. This rule extends to a purchaser at execu
tion sale of the interest of a tenant in common, and to the vendee of
such purchaser. Ward v. Farmer, 92-93 ; Page v. Branch, 97-97.
The seven years' possession need not be next immediately preceding suit. —
Where the plaintiff's title to land is based upon a seven years' adverse
possession under a colorable claim, the law does not require that such
possession should be for the seven years next preceding the commence
ment of the action. Such possession (the title of the land being out of
the state) will vest a title against all the world, which cannot be divested,
except by a subsequent continued adverse possession for seven years
with color of title, or twenty years' adverse possession without color.
Christenbury v. King, 85-229.
Possession of lappage. —In the case of lapping or interfering convey• ances of land where neither party is in actual possession of the lappage,
the law adjudges the possession to follow the title. Williams v. Wallace,
78-354 ; Kitchen v. Wilson, 80-191 ; McLean v. Smith, 106-172.
In case of a lappage, if each bargainee is on his own land outside the
interference, the title will be in him who has the older title, but if the
junior bargainee has had actual adverse possession for seven years with
color, he acquires a title to the part so occupied. Brady v. Maness, 91-135.
Where the line was a long one, running over a wild, mountainous
ridge, and the defendant had possession of less than a quarter of an acre,
such possession was no evidence of an adverse possession of the entire
lappage, in the absence of any evidence of a knowledge by the adverse
party of such possession. King v. Wells, 94-344.
Constructive possession. —The possession by a lessee of a part of a tract
of land gives the lessor constructive possession of the whole of it, but
only the part actually in possession will be protected by the lapse of
time against the real owner. Scott v. Elkins, 83-424 ; Staton v. Mullis,
92-623.
In an action to recover laud, the court charged the jury that title hav
ing been shown to be out of the state, a plaintiff can show title "first
by a paper title ; second, by adverse possession for seven years, under
known and visible boundaries, and under colorable title by plaintiff
and those under whom he claims; and third, by estoppel." If it was
error to leave the jury without further explanation, it was cured when
the court further charged that if the deed (under which plaintiff claimed)
covered the land in dispute, including a certain lot, and the agents rented
and gave that lot in for taxes for seven years before the suit was brought,
the possession of the lot would, by law, be extended to the boundaries
of the deed, and the plaintiff and those under whom he claimed would,
by construction of law, be in possession of the whole. Springs v.
Schenck, 106-153.
Color of title. —A will, devising real property by the name of the tract,
is color of title if the tract is well known by that name, and has metes
and bounds all ascertained, visible and known. Henly v. Wilson, 83-405.
A deed conveying land, which describes it as " one tract of land lying
in the county aforesaid, adjoining lauds of A and B, containing twenty
acres, more or less," does not constitute color of title, and possession
under it is not adverse. Dickens v. Barnes, 79-490.
A paper writing purporting to be a will proved before the proper tri
bunal in 1810 by one witness, is color of title to lands disposed of therein.
McConnell v. McCounell, 64-342.
Color of title is a writing which upon its face professes to pass title to
land. Keener v. Goodson, 89—273.
An assignment of homestead does not constitute color of title. / bid.
An ancient deed accompanied with possession, is evidence of color
of title without proof of its execution, and an unregistered deed, where
there has been continuous adverse possession for seven years, is also evi
dence of color of title. Davis v. Higgins, 91-382.
Where a party introduces a deed in evidence, which he intends to
use as color of title, he must prove that its boundaries cover the land
in dispute, to give legal efficacy to his possession. Smith v. Kite,
92-3I9A deed conveying a life-estate is color of title, and when accompanied
by adverse possession for the required time, will ripen into a good title
to the life-estate so granted. Staton v. Mullis, 92-623.
A conveyance by devisees of land devised to be sold after death of
widow, although accompanied by long possession by the vendees, made
before the death of the widow or the sale by the administrator, cannot
operate as color of title. Orrender v. Call, 101-399.
The deed of a person not! compos is color of title, and possession under
it for seven years ripens into title against those not under disability.
Ellington v. Ellington, 103-54.
The Code, sec. 1245, amended by Laws of 1885, ch. 147, making a con
tract for sale of land inadmissible without registration does not make
registration essential to the use of a deed to show color of title, where
there is a claim and possession under it. Avent v. Arrington, 105-377.
An instrument, though signed, is not available to prove color of title,
unless it is delivered. Avent v. Arrington, 105-377.
A sheriff's deed purporting to pass a fee, even though it does not vest
the interest of the judgment creditor, is good as color of title after
seven years' adverse continuous possession under known and visible
boundaries, the title being out of the state. Manufacturing Co. v.
Brooks, 106-107.
A deed by an administrator is color of title. McMillan v. Gambill,
r°6-359.
A deed is good to show color of title, though improperly admitted to
registration. Brown v. Brown, 106-451.
Notice. —Possession, under color of title works notice to purchasers.
Avent v. Arrington, 105-377 ; Mayo v. Leggett, 96-237.
Need not be pleaded. —Where in an action to recover land, the answer
denied the plaintiff's right of possession, and also set up title in the
defendants, by reason of seven years' possession with color of title,
which was, however, improperly pleaded : // was error to refuse to
allow the defendant to introduce evidence to show his color and posses
sion. Farrior v. Houston, 95-578.
It is competent to prove possession for seven years in support of
a general denial in the pleading that plaintiff was owner—it is not neces
sary to specially plead the statute. Manufacturing Co. v. Brooks, 106-107.
Second story of a house.—Title may ripen by seven years' adverse occu
pancy, under color of title, to the second story of a house when held
separately. Asheville Div. v. Aston, 92-5 7S ; Gilliam v. Bird, 30-280.
Persons under disability. —Seven years' adverse possession is no bar to
an action of ejectment where the party entitled to commence the same
is an infant at the time the title descends to him and sues within three
years next after full age. Clayton v. Rose, 87-106.
Sec. 141. Proviso, in case of judgment for plaintiff re
versed, tf.c. C. C. P., s, 21.
If, in any action for real property, the plaintiff be non
suited or judgment be given for him, and the same be
reversed for error, or a verdict pass for the plaintiff, and
judgment thereon be arrested, then in any such case the
plaintiff may commence a new action from time to time,
within one year after nonsuit, judgment reversed or stayed
as aforesaid, notwithstanding the time limited in the pre
ceding section for bringing such action may have expired,
if the action first brought was commenced within the time
above prescribed for bringing such actions.
New action brought after judgment of nonsuit. —The statute allowing
action to be broughtwithin a year after judgmentof nonsuit, is intended
to extend the period of limitation, not to abridge it. Keener v. Goodson, 89-273.
Sec. 143. Seisin within twenty years when necessary. C.
No action for the recover}' of real property, or the pos
session thereof, shall be maintained, unless it appear that
the plaintiff, or those under whom he claims, was seized
or possessed of the premises in question within twenty
years before the commencement of such action ; subject
to the qualifications in section one hundred and fortyeight, one hundred and forty-nine and one hundred and
fifty.
Tenants in common. —The possession of one tenant in common for
twenty years without any acknowledgment of title in his co-tenant,
and without any claim on the part of his co-tenant to rents, he being
under no disability, formerly raised a presumption of title, but now,
under The Code, has the effect of an absolute title in fee against all per"sons not under disability. Covington v. Stewart, 77-148.
Nothing less than twenty years' adverse possession will bar an actiou
by a tenant in common against a co-tenant. Neely v. Neely, 79-478;
Hicks v. Bullock, 96-164.
A tenant in common in the possession and sole enjoyment of the
common property is not protected by the statute of limitations from
accounting with his co-tenants for rents and profits. The statute begins
only from a demand and refusal to account. Jolly v. Bryan, 86-457.
If one tenant in common occupies the common property for twenty
years, claiming it as his own, the entry of his co-tenants is tolled.
Gaylord v. Respass, 92-553.
See cases cited under sec. 141, ante.
Sec. 144. When adverse possession for twenty years. C. C.
P., s. 23.
No action for the recovery of real property, or the pos
session thereof, or the issues and profits thereof, shall be
maintained when the person in possession thereof, or the
defendant in such action, or those under whom he claims,
shall have possessed such real property under known and
visible lines and boundaries adversely to all other persons
for twenty years ; and such possession so held, shall give a
title in fee to the possessor, in such property, against all
persons not under disability.
Sufficient possession.—The clearing and fencing to a line of marked
trees constitutes a notorious adverse possession, though the intention was
to clear only to the real line between two grants, which line was not
identical with such marked line. Mode v. Long, 64-433.
Where the defendant used a spring on the locus in quo, and built a
spring house thereon, which he used as his own : // 'was held, a suffi
cient possession to satisfy the allegation of wrongful possession by the
defendant. Brittain v. Daniels, 94-781.
Insufficient possession. —When one in possession of land conveys the
same in trust to pay debts, and afterwards it is sold at execution sale
and bid in for the benefit of his wife, and he continues in possession
during his life, and the wife until action brought ; this is not a posses
sion adverse to the trustee or to a purchaser at the sale under deed of
trust. McNeil v. Riddle, 66-290; Covington v. Stewart, 77.148, cited
supra, sec. 143 ; see Malloy v. Bruden, S6-251, cited supra, sec. 139.
Not estopped. —Where one is in possession of land by virtue of a deed
conveying a life-estate, he is not estopped by such deed from setting up
a title in fee by reason of twenty years' possession, against one who is a
stranger, and neither party nor privy to the grantor in the deed convey
ing the life-estate. Brittaiu v. Daniels, 94-781.
Where a party entered upon a tract of land under a deed which con
veyed, by a mistake, only a life-estate, but is in open notorious and con
tinuous possession, claiming up to fixed boundaries for twenty years,
the title being out of the state he gets a good title independent of the
deed. McAlpine v. Daniel, 101-550.
Presumption of grant. —The title being out of the state, and there being
evidence tending to prove a possession for twenty years, by those uuder
whom the plaintiff claims, the jury may presume a grant from one hav
ing title. Melvin v. Waddell, 75-361 ; Mobley v. Griffin, 104-112.
Twenty years' possession of an easement raises a presumption of a
grant. Benbow v. Robbins, 71-338 ; Pearsall v. Kenan, 79-472.
Where the judge charged the jury that if the defendant had occupied
certain land adversely, under known and visible boundaries, for twenty
years, they should presume mesne conveyances to him from the grantee
of the state and those claiming under him, and there was no evidence of
such possession, it was held to be error. King v. Wells, 94-344.
Where it appeared that the locus in quo had been in the actual possession of parties under whom the plaintiff claimed, for sixty years prior
to 1870, but it did not appear that the possession was continued after that
time up to the time when the action was brought, it was error to charge
the jury that the law presumed a grant from twenty years' adverse pos
session, and that they would be at liberty to presume the necessary con
veyances to the plaintiff. Brittain v. Daniels, 94-781.
Presumption of abandonment. —As- the presumption of a grant will arise
by an adversary and continnous use of an easement for twenty years, so
a disuse occurring afterwards for the same length of time, will raise a
presumption of a surrender or extinction of the easement in favor of
the servient tenement. Wiley v. Railroad, 96-408.
Does not apply to street or public square. —Adverse possession of a street
or public square does not ripen into title as against the public. Moose
v. Carson, 104-431.
Note. —By ch. 224, Acts 1891, this is confirmed. See sec. 150a, post.
May become a highway. — A street in a town may become a public highway by continued use of it for twenty years. Such use must be adverse
and of right, and not by the tacit or express permission of the owner.
Stewart v. Frink, 94—487.
Sec. 145. Action after entry. C. C. P., s. 24.
No entry upon real estate shall be deemed sufficient or
valid, as a claim, unless an action be commenced there
upon within one year after the making of such entry, and
within the time prescribed within this title.
Sec. J40. Possession presumed—occupation -when deemed
under legal title. C. C. P., s. 25.
In every action for the recovery of real property, or the
possession thereof, or damages for a trespass on such pos
session, the person establishing a legal title to the premises
shall be presumed to have been possessed thereof within
the time required by law ; and the occupation of such
premises by any other person shall be deemed to have been
under, and in subordination to, the legal title, unless it
appears that such premises have been held and possessed
adversely to such legal title, for the time prescribed by law
before the commencement of such action.
Possession is presumed to be adverse. —Every possession of land by one
other than the claimant is deemed to be adverse until proof to the cou
trary is shown. Ruffin v. Overby, 88-369.
When the plaintiff claims under a deed purporting to convey the land
in dispute, and shows an apparently adverse possession, the burden of
proof is on the defendant to show that such possession is not adverse;
and, when he claims a reversionary estate after a life-estate, that such
life-estate determined too short a time before the bringing of the action
to bar his right. Staton v. Mullis, 92-623.
Where A, having a life-estate, conveys to B in fee, who conveys to C,
the reversioner or remainderman does not have a right of action until
the death of the life-tenant At his death, the possession becomes
adverse, and will ripen into a good title by seven years' possession, the
title being out of the state. Ibid.
Possession by a grantee of any part of the land described in his deed,
is constructive possession of the entire tract against all persons, except
a party having a superior title to the part of which there is only con
structive possession. Ibid.
Possession not adverse. —In case of common possession by two persons,
the ownership draws to it the possession, and it is presumed to be in him
who has the title. So, where a ward resided with his guardian on a tract
of land in which he had an interest as tenant-in-commoii, his possession
is presumed to be in accordance with his title, and there is no adverse
possession against him. Gaylord v. Respass, 92-553.
The possession of a widow remaining on her husband's land after his
death, is not adverse to his heirs at law. Page v. Branch, 97-97.
When no actual possession, the constructive possession is in the real owner. —
In the absence of possession in another, he who has the legal estate is, in
construction of law, in possession. Kennedy v. Wheatley, 3-402 ; Dobbs
v. Gullige, 20-165 I London v. Bear, 84-266. See Malloy v. Bruden, j> 139,
ante.
Where there is no actual possession, the superior title draws to it the
possession. Deming v. Gainey, 95-528.
Possession is notice. —Actual possession of land is notice to the world
of any equity of the occupant. Mayo v. Leggett, 96-237 ; Avent v.
Arlington, 105-377.
Presumption of possession. —If the legal title is established in the plain
tiff, he is presumed to have been possessed, within the time prescribed by
law. of the premises, unless the contrary is shown. Johnston v. Pate,
83-110.
Sec. 147. Relation of landlord and tenant. C. C. I*., s. 20.
Whenever the relation of landlord and tenant shall have
existed between any persons, the possession of the tenant
shall be deemed the possession of the landlord, until the
expiration of twenty years from the termination of tenancy;
or where there has been 110 written lease, until the expira
tion of twenty years from the time of the last payment of
rent, notwithstanding that such tenant may have acquired
another title, or may have claimed to hold adversely to his
landlord. But such presumptions shall not be made after
the periods herein limited.
Deemed adverse. —If one who enters as a tenant remains in possession
twenty years, after the expiration of his tenancy, without paying rent
or otherwise acknowledging his tenancy, his possession is deemed
adverse. Melvin v. Waddell, 75-361 ; Yates v. Yates, 76-142.
Estoppel. —The defendant is estopped if he was either tenant of the
plaintiff or derived title through his tenant when the action was brought.
Melvin v. Waddell, 75-361 ; Conwell v. Mann, 100-234 ; Mobley v. Grif
fin, 104-112.
Sec. 148. Person under disabilities. C. C. P., s. 27.
If a person entitled to commence any action for the
recovery of real property, or to make an entry or defence
founded on the title to real property, or to rents and ser
vices out of the same, be, at the time such title shall
descend or accrue, either,
(1) Within the age of twenty-one years, or
(2) Insane, or
See ch. 89, Acts 1889, cited under \ 136, ante.
Insane. —A cause of action to set aside a deed executed by one alleged
to have been non compos, arises immediately upon its execution, and the
period within which the action may be brought is prolonged three years
after the restoration of reason, or, if he continues insane, a like period
for those to whom the estate would have descended. Ellington v. Elling
ton, 103-54.
If land is held adversely to an insane person for such length of time
as would bar his recovery if sane, such insane person, or those claiming
under him, must commence an action within three years after the disa
bility of insanity is removed, else their right to recover will be barred.
Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec 1 ; The Code, U 148, 163 ; Warlick v. Plonk,
103-81.
(3) Imprisoned on a criminal charge, or in execution
upon conviction of a criminal offence, or
(4) A married woman ;
Then such person may, notwithstanding the time of lim
itation prescribed in this title be expired, commence his
action, or make his entry, within three years next after full
age, coming of sound mind, enlargement out of prison, or
discoverture ; and at no time thereafter.
Feme covert. —A delay by a feme coz-cri, tenant in common, for three
years after the death of her husband and seven years after the death of
her father, who had a life-estate in the land, does not bar her action.
Day v. Howard, 73-1.
See, also, \ 17S, post, which allows a married woman to sue alone in
matters affecting her separate estate. It is held that this does not
remove the disability of coverture when she is a defendant in actions
concerning such estate. Lippard v. Troutuian, 72-551 ; Campbell v.
Crater, 95-156. See Clayton v. Rose, 87-106, under ji 141, ante.
Presumption of the ratification of a voidable deed by long acquies
cence, will not arise against a woman under the disability of coverture.
Epps v. Flowers, 101-158.
If statute begins to run, it is not stopped. — If the statute begins to run
nothing stops it. If it begins to run against the ancestor, it continues
to run against the heir, although under disability when the descent is
cast. There is nothing in this section which changes the law as it form
erly existed. Frederick v. Williams, 103-189.
Sec. 14!). Cumulative disabilities. C. C. P.,s.2S.
When two or more disabilities shall co-exist, or when one
disability shall supervene an existing one, the period pre
scribed within which an action may be brought shall not
begin to run until the termination of the latest disability.
Cumulative. —Where a feme plaintiff did not become of age until 1S66,
the suspension of the statute of limitations saved her rights until 1870,
and if she incurred the disability of coverture before the date last men
tioned, the statute does not begin to run until the removal of her cover
ture. Lippard v. Troutman, 72-551 ; Campbell v. Crater, 95-156. See,
also, cases cited under £ 136, ante.
Sec. loO. Railroads, etc., not barred. R. C, c. 6*5, 0. 23.
C. C. P., s. 29.
No railroad, plank road, turnpike or canal company,
shall be barred of, or presumed to have conveyed, any real
estate, right-of-way, easement, leasehold, or other interest
in the soil which may have been condemned, or otherwise
obtained for its use, as a right-of-way, depot, station-house
or place of landing, by any statute of limitation or by
occupation of the same by any person whatever.
No statute runs against a railroad. —No presumption of abandonment or
of a grant, and no statute of limitation, runs against a railroad company
by the adverse occupation of any of.the land condemned or otherwise
obtained by them for the purposes of the road. Railroad v. McCaskill,
94-746 ; Purefoy v Railroad, 10S-100.
Sec. 1,10a. Cities and towns not barred. Ch. 224, Acts 1891.
No person or corporation shall ever acquire any exclu
sive right to any part of any public road, street, lane,
alley, square or public way of any kind by reason of any
occupancy thereof or by encroaching upon or obstructing
the same in any way, and in all actions, whether civil or
criminal, against any person or corporation on account of
any encroachment upon or obstruction of or occupancy of
any public way, it shall not be competent for any court to
hold that such action is barred by any statute of limita
tions. That the provisions of this act shall not apply to
or affect any existing suits, and that the same shall only
apply to obstructions and encroachments on public ways in
cities and towns.
Sec. 151. Periods of limitation prescribed. C. C. P., s. 30.
The periods prescribed for the commencement of actions,
other than for the recovery of real property, shall be as
follows :
Burden on plaintiff. —When the statute of limitations is pleaded, it
devolves upon the plaintiff to show that his cause of action accrued
within the time limited by law for beginning it. Hussey v. Kirkman,
95-63; Hobbs v. Barefoot, 104-224; Moore v. Garner, 101-374.
Optional with administrator or executor. —An administrator may elect to
plead the statute. Parker v. Grant, 91-338.
An executor, when sued for an account, is entitled to credit for pay
ments made by him on debts of his testator, although such debts were
barred by the statute of limitations, or were, under the statute of pre
sumptions, presumed to have been paid at or before the death of the
testator. The law does not require an executor to make his testator
"sin in his grave," by setting up an unconscientious defence. Halli
burton v, Carson, 100-99.
NOTE.—The statute now requires the personal representative to plead
the statute, if available, in all actions begun after January 1, 1S92, Acts
iSgr, chaps. 92 and 356. See \ 176a, post.
Right of heir to plead the statute. —Where an administrator files a peti
tion to sell the lands of his intestate to make assets, if the debts to be
paid have not been reduced to judgment, the heir may plead that they
are barred by the statute, but when the demand has been reduced to
judgment against the administrator, the heir is bound by the judgment
unless he can show that it was obtained by collusion and fraud, and is
barred by it from setting up any matter which might have been pleaded
by the administrator as a bar in the suit against him. Bevers v. Park,
88-456; Speer v. James, 94-417 ; Halliburton v. Carson, 100-99; Proctor
v. Proctor, 105-222 ; Long v. Oxford, 108-280.
Where the statute of limitations would be available to the personal
representative of a deceased person against the.demand of a creditor, it
is also available to the heir in protecting the real estate. Smith v.
Brown, 99-377.
Administrations granted prior to July 1, 1869. —The various statutes direct
ing the manner in which estates of deceased persons shall be adminis
tered and settled discriminating between those where administration was
granted prior and subsequent to the 1st day of July, 1869, do not affect
the operations of the statutes of limitations, but only apply to the mode
0/procedure of settlement. Smith v. Brown, 99-377.
When a question of law. —The question whether a claim is barred by the
statute, is never exclusively for the court, unless the facts raising the
question are alleged in the complaint. Wright v. Cain, 93-296.
Cases where the statute does not run.—An action brought by one creditor
in behalf of himself and all other creditors, stops the statute of limita
tions from running against any creditor who comes in and proves his
debt under the decree, from the date of the beginning of the action.
Dobson v. Simonton, 93-268.
The statute of limitations does not run when there is no one in esse
capable of suing. Grant v. Hughes, 94-231.
NOTE. —This came under the former statute; as to the present law, see
£ 164, and cases cited.
Where the tax-payer does not pay his taxes, and the sheriff is forced
to advance the amount due, in order to settle his tax-list, this is not a
payment of the tax, as it is not an officious act of the sheriff, and the
statute of limitations does not run against the debt, when the. sheriff is
authorized by au act of the Legislature to collect unpaid taxes. Jones v.
Arrington, 94-541.
There is no statute of limitations applicable to an action brought bv
citizens to test the validity of an election held to ascertain the will of the
majority of the qualified voters in a township relative to subscribing
stock to a railroad company, but such action must be brought within a
reasonable time. Jones v. Commissioners, 107-248.
Trustee. —Where au action is brought to compel a settlement of the
estate of an intestate in the hands of his administrator, the administra
tor is a trustee of an express trust, and the statute of limitations does
not apply. Grant v. Hughes, 94-23 1.
Where a trust is created by the agreement of the parties, no length of
time will bar the cestui que trust, for the possession of the trustee cannot
be adverse, unless the trustee repudiate the trust by clear and unequivo
cal acts or words brought to the notice of the cestui que trust, but when
it is sought to convert a party who has the legal title into a trustee by a
decree, he may insist that his possession was adverse, and be protected
by the statute of limitations. University v. Bank, 96-280.
Where the plaintiff, pursuant to previous understanding, purchased
lauds for defendant, but took title, to be held in his own name until he
could pay the purchase-mouey advanced, to which payment the rents
were to be applied, and plaintiff went into possession and so continued
for several years : Held, (1) that the defendant was entitled to have
plaintiff declared a trustee to hold the lands for his benefit, to the extent
of defendant's interest therein ; (2) that the statute of limitations was
no bar to defendant's action. Hinton v. Pritchard, 107-128.
Cestui que trust. —When the statute of limitations is a bar to the trustee,
it is also a bar to the cestui que trust for whom he holds the title, both at
law and in equity. Clayton v. Cagle, 97-300.
Pleading the statute. —An allegation of defendants that " they plead the
statute of limitations of ten, seven, six and three years, as prescribed in
The Code, to all of said claims, and aver that they are unable to plead
the same more definitely to each and all of said claims," is bad and
insufficient, without amendment. Turner v. Shuffler, 108-642.
Cannot be pleaded, when. —A party will not be allowed to set up the stat
ute in bar of a debt, where it appears the delay in suing was caused by
the promise of himself or attorney that the matter would be settled and
no advantage taken of the lapse of time. Barcroft v. Roberts, 92-363.
Begins to run. —The statute (The Code, \ 3836) barring actions for
the recovery of the penalty for taking usury, begins to run from the
time of the payment or receiving of the usurious interest, and not from
the date of the contract from which it arose. Pritchard v. Meekins, 98244.
The statute giving an action to a surety who has paid the debt against
a co-surety, when the principal shall be insolvent or out of the state, has
reference to the time when action is brought, and not to the time of pay
ment by the surety. Leak v. Covington. 99-559.
Partners stand in the relation of trustees for each other, and something
must be done to render that relation adversary, before the statute of
limitations will begin to run. Rencher v. Anderson, 95-208.
When a new canse of action is added by amendment. —Where a distinct cause
of action is allowed to be inserted in a complaint, by amendment, it is
tantamount to bringing a new action, and the statute of limitation runs
to the time when the amendment is allowed ; but this rule does not
apply when the new matter allowed by the amendment constitutes a
part of the original cause of action. Ely v. Early, 94-1 ; Hester v. Mul
len, 107-724.
Owelty of partition. —A party acquiring land on which a charge rests for
equality of partition takes the same cum onere, and the statute of limita
tions cannot avail him as against a purchaser at a sale made under a
venditioni exponas, duly ordered in the partition proceedings. Dobbin
v. Rex, 106-444.
Where the decree creating the charge of owelty was entered in 1S67,
there is no statute of limitations applicable as a bar. In re Walker, 107340In equity. —The enforcement of an equity will never be denied, on the
ground of lapse of time, where the party seeking it has been in continu
ous possession of the estate to which the equity is an incident. The
court will lend its aid in every such case, except where, by laches, the
party has abandoned his right and acquiesced in its enjoyment by
another in a manner inconsistent with his own claim. Mask v. Tiller,
S9-423In causes of action, which under the former practice could have been
brought in a court of law or a court of equity, the court of equity will be
bound by the statute of limitations as much as the court of law would.
University v. Bank, 96-280.
foreclosure of mortgage, though debt barred. —Limitations for personal
actions do not apply to remedy by foreclosure. Where a debt, barred by
statute, is secured by a mortgage or any collateral security which is not
barred, the mortgagee may foreclose or enforce lieu on collaterals. Capehart v. Dettrick, 92-334. See 'i 152, 3 post.
The statute defeats the remedy but does not discharge the debt. Ibid.
Bight to follow the fond, though debt barred. —Where property is conveyed
to sureties to indemnify them on account of their suretyship, the credi
tor may pursue the property in their hands and force them to apply it in
satisfaction of the debt, although the personal remedy against them is
barred by the statute of limitations. Ijames v. Gaither, 93-358 ; Long v.
Miller, 93-227.
Legislative control. —The legislature may extend or shorten the time,
provided in the latter case a reasonable time is given for the commence
ment of the action. Strickland v. Draughan, 91-103 ; Whitehurst v.
Dey, 90-542.
Possession of a chattel. —Four years' possession of a chattel does not
give title in North Carolina, though it is prima facie evidence of owner
ship, and, if adverse and long-continued, may ripen into a good title.
Pate v. Hazell, 107-189.
When demand necessary. —A trustee or bailee does not hold adversely
until after a demand, and until then the statute of limitations does not
begin -to run. Earp v. Richardson, 78-277; Earp v. Richardson, 81-5;
Bryant v. Peebles, 92-176.
Objection must be taken by answer. —See '(, 138, ante, and cases there cited.
Sec. 152. Ten years. C. C. P., ss. 14, 31.
Within ten years—
(1) An action upon a judgment or decree of any court of
this state, or of the United States, or of any state or terri
tory thereof, from the date of the rendition of said judg
ment or decree. But no such action shall be brought more
than once, nor have the effect to continue the lien of the
original judgment.
Judgment lien lost. —The lien of a docketed judgment is lost by delay
ing for more than ten years to enforce it by execution. Fox v. Kline,
S5-I73And this is so notwithstanding execution has issued within the ten
years. Pasour v. Rhyue, 82-149.
Where a judgment was rendered on the 20th of October, 1S73, and an
action was brought on the judgment on the 20th of October, 1883 : It ?vas
held, that the statute barring actions on judgment iu ten years, was a
defence to the action. Cook v. Moore, 95-1.
The expiration of ten years after a judgment is docketed is equally a
bar to an action on such judgment, and to a motion to revive it, being
dormant, so that execution may issue on it. Lilly v. West, 97-276.
Specialties, when reduced to judgment, are merged, and the statute
barring judgments will then apply. Brittaiu v. Dickson, 104-547.
Decree of owelty in partition. —The charge in partition upon the more
valuable share is not a mere debt secured by lien. The debtor is tenant
iu common with the holder of the share in whose favor the decree is
entered to the exteut of the charge, until the same shall be satisfied.
Dobbin v. Rex, 106-444 ; Tn re Walker, 107-340.
Sale under execution void. —A sale of laud under execution, issued more
than ten years after the docketing of the judgment, is invalid, and the
purchaser at such sale obtains 110 title. Lyon v. Russ, 84-58S.
Sale of personal property valid. —An execution may be issued after the
lapse of ten years from the docketing of the judgment (where it has
been duly kept alive), and a levy and sale of personal property under it
is valid. Williams v. Mullis, 87-159.
leave to sue. —When leave is obtained of the judge to bring action on a
judgment, or if leave is refused, his decision, whether "good cause" is
shown, is conclusive. Warren v. Warren, S4-614 ; Kendall v. Briley,
S6-56.
A party can have execution ou his judgment, and at the same time
irosecute an action on it by leave of the court. McDonald v. Dickion,
Leave to bring suit upon a judgment is not now necessary. C. C. P.
14, is not brought forward in the Code. Dunlap v. Hendley, 92-115.
Bar to issuing execution. —The lapse of teu years is a complete bar, when
pleaded, to a motion for leave to issue execution on a judgment. Mc
Donald v. Dickson, 85-24S.
The statute of limitations may be set up as a defence by an admin
istrator to a motion for leave to issue execution after ten years from the date of docketing judgment against his intestate, although executions
have been regularly issued within each successive period of three years.
Berry v. Corpening, 30-395.
Judgment as counterclaim or set-off. —This section does not prevent using
a judgment as a counterclaim or set-off. McClenahan v. Cotten, 83-332.
Presumption of payment. —A judgment rendered before, but docketed
after, the adoption of the C. C. P., is subject only to a presumption of
satisfaction. Johnston v. Jones, 87-393.
Judgment on a cause of action arising prior to C. C. P. —A judgment ren
dered in 1870 on a debt contracted prior to 1868 is subject to the provi
sions of this. chapter, whenever such judgment becomes itself causa
lilis. McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248.
A judgment quando, unlike a final judgment, is not a new cause of
action. Gaither v. Sain, 91-304.
The statute which bars actions upon judgments after the lapse of ten
years from the date thereof, does not apply to actions commenced before
August, 1S6S, or where the right of action accrued before that date.
Gaither v. Sain, 91-304.
Judgment against a corporation. —A judgment against a corporation is
not barred in three years after the corporation has ceased to do its reg
ular business, if its charter has not expired. Heggie v. B. & L. Ass'u,
107-581.
Foreign judgment. —This section applies to a judgment taken in another
state. Miller v. Leach, 95-229.
Merger. —The statutes of limitations for the protection of estates of
deceased persons from judgments rendered against the personal repre
sentatives begin to run from the date of the judgment, irrespective of
the time of the accruing of the original cause of action, such cause of
action being merged in the judgment. Smith v. Brown, 99-377.
Where the action is brought for a breach of an administration bond,
the cause of action is the original debt, and not a judgment theretofore
taken fixing the administrator with assets. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
The failure of an administrator to fully administer the assets that
come, or ought to come, into his hands, constitutes a breach of his offi
cial bond, which can be cured only by actual payment—and the cause
of action on the bond is not merged in a judgment obtained against the
administrator for a debt due the plaintiff. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
Effect of partial payment. —A partial payment voluntarily made on a
judgment within ten years preceding a motion for leave to issue execu
tion thereon, does not remove the statutory bar. McDonald V. Dick
son, 87-404.
As to homesteads. —The statute of i869-'7o, suspending the statute of
limitations till the falling in of the reversionary estate in the land
embraced by the homestead, only applies where the homestead has been
actually allotted, and only to judgments docketed in the county where
the homestead is situate. McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248 ; Cotton v.
McClenahan, 85-254.
Justices' judgments. —A justice's judgment docketed in the superior
court becomes a judgment of that court, so ^ar as enforcing its lien is
concerned. Such lien is in force for ten years, and execution will issue
to enforce it. Broyles v. Young, 81-315; Cannon v. Parker, 81-320;
Adams v. Guy, 106-275.
But an action on such judgment would be barred by the lapse of seven
years. Daniel v. Laughlin, 87-433 ; Broyles v. Young, 81-315.
(2) An action upon a sealed instrument against the prin
cipal thereto.
Interest. —The interest on such instrument is not barred until the
principal is, though it is agreed "to be paid annually." Knight v. Braswell, 70-709.
Sureties. —It is competent to show by parol evidence that a joint obli
gor to a sealed instrument is in fact a surety, and that the obligee was
aware of it at the time he accepted the instrument. Welfare v. Thomp
son, 83-276.
Where the defendant sets up that he is a surety, and the suretyship
does not appear from the instrument signed by him, he must prove that
the creditor had knowledge of the suretyship. Goodman v. Litaker,
84-8 ; Torrence v. Alexander, 85-143.
Three years is a bar to an action against a surety although the note
be under seal. Joyuer v. Massey, 97-148.
Guaranty. —An action upon a guaranty under seal is not barred until
ten years after the cause of action accrues. Coleman v. Fuller, 105-32S.
Does not appply to bonds executed prior to C. C. P. —The statute of limita
tions has no application to bonds due before the adoption of the C C P.
Crawford v. McLellan, 87-169.
Partial payment. —Payment on a bond within ten years after maturity
by the assignee in bankruptcy of one of the obligors repels the pre
sumption arising from the lapse of time. Belo v. Spach, 85-122.
(3) An action for the foreclosure of a mortgage, or deed
in trust for creditors with a power of sale, of real property,
where the mortgagor or grantor has been in possession of
the property, within ten years after the forfeiture of the
mortgage, or after the power of sale became absolute, or
within ten years after the last payment on the same.
Purchaser from mortgagor. —A purchaser from the mortgagor, the mort
gage being registered, is not colorable title, and seven years, therefore,
will not bar the mortgagee. Ten years, as above specified, must elapse.
Parker v. Banks, 79-480.
Effect of partial payment.—Where there is a payment upon a mortgage,
the statute begins to run only from such payment. Ely v. Bush, 89-358.
Death of mortgagor. —An action to foreclose a mortgage, where no part
of the mortgage debt has been paid and the mortgagor remains in pos
session, is barred in ten years from the forfeiture, and the same rule
applies where the mortgagor died before the time expired and the action
is brought against his heirs. Fraser v. Bean, 96-327.
Debt not necessarily barred, if mortgage is. —The provisions of this section
only bar an action to foreclose the mortgage, and does not bar an action
to recover the debt secured by the mortgage. Fraser v. Bean, 96-327.
Quaere. —Where the heir successfully pleads the statute of limitations
to an action brought to foreclose a mortgage executed by his ancestor,
but a judgment for the debt is obtained against the administrator : Qtuere,
what will be the result of a proceeding by the administrator to sell the
land to make assets to pay the judgment ? Fraser v. Bean, 96-327.
Mortgage not necessarily barred when action on debt is. —Although an
action upon the debt secured by a mortgage may be barred by the lapse
of time, the remedy appertaining to the security may be enforced. Capehart v. Dettrick, 91-344 ; Long v. Miller, 93-227 ; Arlington v. Rowland,
97-127 ; Overman v. Jackson, 104-4.
Subsequent mortgagee or purchaser of equity. —A subsequent mortgagee,
or purchaser of the equity of redempton, can avail himself of the pro
tection of the statute of limitations against a prior mortgagee, although
the mortgagor is a party to the action and refuses to plead the statute.
Hill v. Hilliard, 103-34.
Acknowledgment of mortgagor. —After the rights of the first mortgagee
are barred by the statute, no act or acknowledgment on the part of the
mortgagor can revive the mortgage as to subsequent mortgagees or pur
chasers. —Hill v. Hilliard, 103-34.
(4) An action for the redemption of a mortgage, where
.the mortgagee has been in possession, or for a residuary
interest under a deed in trust for creditors, where the
trustee or those holding under him shall have been in pos
session ; within ten years after the right of action accrued.
Presumption of release or reconveyance. —A mortgagee's actual possession
of the land for ten years after default raises a presumption of a release
of the equity of redemption, and a similar possession for ten years by the
mortgagor will raise a presumption of a reconveyance. Edwards v.
Tipton, 85-479.
Action fbr reconveyance or redemption. —Where the answer admits that a
deed for land, absolute upon its face, had been made, as charged in the
complaint, upon a parol trust that it should be a security for the pay
ment of money, and the plaintiff has all the while been in possession,
the lapse of ten years will not bar an action for reconveyance upon a
tender of the money. Price v. Gaskins, 62-224.
Where a mortgagee takes adverse possession of, and rents out the
mortgaged land, the payment of rent to him by his tenants on the laud
does not affect the running of the statute of limitations against the mort
gagor's right to sue for redemption. Frederick v. Williams, 103-189.
Where neither mortgagor nor mortgagee is in possession. —The mere lapse
of time, unaccompanied by any possession, neither obstructs the right
to redeem nor the right to foreclose a mortgage. Therefore, where a
mortgage was made in 1S56 to secure a debt falling due in 1858, and no
payment was made on the debt after maturity, an action to redeem
commenced in 1883 is not barred by chapter 65, Rev. Code, it being
shown that neither mortgagor nor mortgagee had been in possession of
the land, and the same rule applies under this section. Simmons v.
Ballard, 102-105.
Under Revised Code. —The statute (Rev. Code, ch. 65, sec. 19) providing
that "the presumption of payment or abandonment of the right of
redemption of mortgages and other equitable interests shall arise within
ten years after forfeiture," etc., contains no saving clause in favor of
persons under disabilities.
Sec. 153.
Within
(1) An
the peace,

Seven years. C. C. P.,s. 32.
seven years—
action on a judgment rendered by a justice of
from the date thereof.

Socketed in the superior court. —An action on a justice's judgment is
barred by the lapse of seven years, and neither docketing the same in
the superior court nor the death of the debtor will arrest the running
of the statute. Daniel v. Laughlin, 87-433 ; Broyles v. Young, 81-315.
A judgment was obtained before a justice of the peace in 1878 on a
prior judgment, also obtained before a justice of the peace ; the last
judgment was docketed in the superior court, and in 18S6 leave was
obtained, after objection, to issue execution : Held, that the leave was
properly granted. Adams v. Guy, 106-275.
See \ 152 (1) and cases cited.
Dormancy of judgment. —A justice's judgment being dormant, or the
plaintiff's having no right to transfer it to the superior court and docket
it, are insufficient of themselves to bar an action 011 it. Bacon v. Berrv,
85-124.
Surety'to the stay. —One who signs the stay of a justice's judgment
becomesja party to the judgment, and the limitation as to such judg
ment, and not that applicable to the contract, applies to him. Barritiger v. Allison, 78-79.
(2) By any creditor of a deceased person against his per
sonal or real representative, within seven years next after
the qualification of the executor or administrator, and his
making the advertisement required by law, for creditors of
the deceased to present their claims, where no personal ser
vice of such notice in writing is made upon the creditor ;
and a creditor thus barred of a recovery against the repre
sentative of any principal debtor shall also be barred of a
recovery against any surety to such debt.
Personal representative must prove lapse of time and advertisement. —A per
sonal representative who pleads this section must show that the seven
years have expired next after his qualification, before suit brought, and
that he has advertised according to law. Cox v. Cox, 84-138.
Personal representative having assets, must aver and prove, what. —Where
the administrator has assets and he relies upon the statute of limitations
(Rev. Code, ch. 65, \ 11), such plea must be supported by the aver
ment and proof to sustain it, made by the administrator, that he has
paid the assets to those entitled to have them, and taken refunding
bonds, or, that he has paid the same to the trustees of the University,
clark's code of civil procedure
accordingly as the statute requires, to make it effectual. Little v. Dun
can. 89-416.
To enable the personal representative of a deceased person to avail
himself of the limitations provided in this section, he must allege in his
plea, andprove upon the trial, that he made the advertisement, or gave the
personal notice to the creditors, as prescribed in the statute. The mere
lapse of time—seven years—does not create the bar ; it must be coupled
with the advertisement, or personal notice, and when these have been
made, the statute will begin to run from the date of the qualification of
the executor or administrator. Love v. Ingram, 104-600.
Action by creditor Suits against an administrator must be brought by
creditors of the deceased within seven years next after qualification of
the administrator, whether there be assets in his hands or not. While
the advertisement for creditors to present their claims is an indispensa
ble requisite to its operation, yet as to the time from which the statute
begins to run it is incidental. Lawrence v. Norfleet, 90-533.
A creditor must bring his action within seven years after the qualifica
tion of the personal representative, and the advertisement for creditors.
Woody v. Brooks, 102-334.
Action by administrator of creditor. —Where suit is brought by one
administrator against another it must be commenced within seven years
next after the right of action vests in the plaintiff under his appointment.
Lawrence v. Norfleet, 90-533 ; Worthy v. Mcintosh, 90-536.
Action by administrator de bonis non. —Where administration was granted
in 1859 an,l tne administrator died in 1877 and suit on his bond was
brought by the administrator de bonis non in 1879, directly after his
qualification : It was held, that the action was not barred by the statute
of limitatiou. Qucere, whether in such case, the present statute of limi
tatiou applies, or that in force prior to 1868. Grant v. Rogers, 94-755.
There administration was granted before 1868. —An action against an
administratrix, who qualified in 1863, upon a debt due and owing by the
intestate to a creditor capable of bringing suit, is barred after the lapse
of seven years. McKeithan v. McGill, 83-517.
Beranding bonds. —The administrator, having filed his final account in
August, 1869, and paid over the balance to the distributees without taking
refunding bonds, would not have been protected by the two years statute
of limitation prescribed in the Revised Code, but as this provision of the
Revised Code requiring refunding bonds was repealed in i868-'69, and the
settlement was made after such repeal and before the act of 1870 declar
ing the act of 1868-'69 prospective only, but validating all bona fide set
tlements made under its provisions : Held, that, as the plaintiffs never
sented their claims or sued for the same until 1889, they were barred
the statute of limitations ; and they would also have been barred by
seven years statute, which does not require refunding bonds. Bobbitt v. Jones, 107-658.
Pleading. —Whereon a petition to sell lands to make assets the heir
pleaded that " if there is any indebtedness outstanding against the estate
of plaintiff 's intestate, the same is barred by the statute of limitations"
(The Code, \ 153, par. 2), "and the said statute of limitations is
hereby pleaded against the collection of said claims," although the
piea is indefinite and unsatisfactory, it was the duty of the court below
to have considered and determined it, and a failure to do so is error.
Proctor v. Proctor, 105-222.
Advertisement. —The requirement that to avail himself of the seven
years statute, the personal representative must show that he has made
due advertisement, is confined to the original administration, and does
not apply to administration de bonis non. Smith v. Brown, 99-377.
Applies to heir as well as to personal representative. —By the provisions of
this subsection an action is absolutely barred against both the personal
representative and the heir, unless it is brought w ithin seven years after
the qualification of the personal representative and the advertisement
for creditors, and nothing will defeat its operation, except the disa
bilities mentioned in The Code, or such fraud or other matter of equitable
nature as would make it against conscience to rely on the statute.
Syme v. Badger, 96-197 ; Andres v. Powell, 97-155.
Sec. 154. Six years. C. C. P., s. 33.
Within six years—
(1) An action upon the official bond of any public officer.
Part payment. —A partial payment made by a surety on an agreement
with the county commissioners that it would relieve him from further
liability will not stop the running of the statute. Hewlett v. Schenck,
82-234.
Statute runs from breach of the bond. —Where a sheriff in a claim and
delivery proceeding returned the property to the defendant without tak
ing the bond required by law, it is a breach of the sheriff's official bond,
and the statute of limitations begins to run from the breach and not
from the termination of the action for claim and delivery. Hughes v.
Newsom, 86-424.
An action upon an official bond may be brought within six years after a
breach thereof; the statute does not begin to run from the date of the
bond, but only from the breach. Com'rs v. McRae, 89-95 ; Baker v. lionroe, 15-412; Coomer v. Little, 1-223.
Unlawful Sale. —When a sheriff unlawfully sells property exempt from
sale under execution, it is a breach of his bond. The statute runs from
the date of the unlawful sale, and the action is barred in six years.
Hobbs v. Barefoot, 104-224.
Amercement. —When an amercement has been imposed upon a sheriff
for a false return made more than six years previous, an actiou upon his
official bond to recover the penalty is barred by the statute of limita
tions. Hobbs v. Barefoot, 104-224.
When demand necessary. —A demand is necessary before bringing an ac
tion upon the bond of a clerk for moneys, payable to private individuals,
received by color of his office, and the statute of limitations will not
begin to run in his favor until after such demand is made. If he has
converted the money, no demand is necessary, and the statute begins to
run in his favor from the time of the conversion. Furman v. Timberlake, 93-66.
(2) An actiou against any executor, administrator, col
lector, or guardian, on his official bond, within six years
after the auditing of his final account by the proper officer,
and the filing of such audited account as required by law.
For distributive shares. —An action by the next of kin, upon the bond
of the administrator, to recover distributive shares, is barred after six
years from auditing the administrator's account, and this both as to the
principal and surety on the bond. Vaughan v. Hines, 87-445.
An action must be brought against an executor or administrator by a
creditor, legatee or next of kin of the decedent, within six years after
the filing of the final account, or it will be barred by the statute. Andres
v. Powell, 97-155Sureties. —Where the cause of action is to recover the balance admitted
to be due by the final account, it is barred as to sureties on the bond
after six years from auditing and filing such final account. Vaughan v.
Hines, 87-445 : Kennedy v. Cromwell, 108-1.
An action against the personal representative, on his bond, must be
brought within six years after the filing and auditing of the final account.
In addition to the protection of this section, the sureties on the bond are
exonerated within three years, if the action is for a breach of the bond.
The Code, sec. 155 (6); Woody v. Brooks, 102-334.
When the statute begins to run. —Until the final accounts of administra
tors and executors are properly filed, made and audited, the statute of
limitations prescribed in this subsection (2) will not begin to run. Reaves
v. Davis, 99-425Defective plea. —A plea of the statute of limitations by a guardian to an
action by his wards is defective if it does not set out when the cause of
action accrued and when the ward arrived at full age. Humble v. Mebane, 89-410.
To re-open a settlement. —Where there is no settlement with parties enti
tled, six years from the auditing is the limitation. But where there is a
settlement had, a proceeding to impeach it must be begun in three years,
except where the party is a feme covert and under disability to sue.

an action will lie on a quantum meruit, and the statute begins to run
from the death. Miller v. Lash, 85-51.
Where services are rendered for a series of years under no definite
contract as to duration, mode of compensation or rate, the statute begins
to run as the services are rendered, or, at least, from the end of each
year. Miller v. Lash, S5-51.
Where the plaintiff made a payment, the defendant promising to refund
any excess over the amount due, and upon reference a balance was found
due the plaintiff, the statute runs only from the finding. Moore v. Com
missioners, 87-209.
Trust or agency. —On an express trust or agency the statute only runs
from a demand.; but on an implied or constructive trust or agency, the
statute runs as soon as the property or money is received. Robertson v.
Dunn, S7-191.

Where an agency is alleged and denied, the plaintiff need not prove
a demand ; otherwise when the agency is admitted in the answer. Waddell v. Swann, 91-108; King v. Foscue, 91-116.
A demand is necessary before an action will lie or the statute begin to
run when an agent has collected money and not paid it over. When the

a demand. In this case the statute begins to run from the receipt of the
money and bars the action in three years. Bryant v. Peebles, 92-176.

possession for rents and profits (unless there is an actual ouster). Jolly
v. Bryan, S6-457.
Creditors' bill. —This statute can be pleaded by one creditor of the dece
dent's estate against the claims of another, Oates v. Lilly, S4-643.
Where a creditor's bill was filed in 1877, and in 1880 a simple contract
creditor offered to prove a debt contracted in 1876, to which the statute
of limitation was pleaded ; the statute only ran to the day when the
action was brought, and the debt was not barred. Dobson v. Sitnontou,
93-268.
Rents. —Where a deed, alleged to have been executed under duress, is
cancelled, the plaintiff can recover for rents extending back not more
than three years before the commencement of the action. Reed v.
Exum, 84-430.
Sureties on sealed instruments. —A surety to a sealed instrument is pro
tected by the lapse of three years. Welfare v. Thompson, 83-276.
Where the suretyship is known to the original payee the surety is pro
tected by the lapse of three years (if the statute is pleaded), when the
bond is assigned after maturity, whether the assignee took with or with
out notice. Capell v. Long, 84-17.
When the fact of suretyship does not appear upon the face of the bond,

only from the time of payment. Leak v. Covington, 99-559 ; Parham v.
Green, 64-436.
But where a principal debtor executes a mortgage to his surety to save
him harmless for any loss he may sustain by reason of his suretyship,
although the amount is unascertained at the time the mortgage is given,
it becomes a debt due by covenant, and is not barred by the lapse of
three years from the time the surety pays the money. Arrington v.
Rowland, 97-127.
Although two obligors appear ou the face of a negotiable bond to be
joint principals, yet if the obligee had notice that one was a surety, that
fact can be shown by oral evidence, as against the obligee ; but if the
obligee endorse the bond before maturity to A, who has no notice, and
he in turn endorses the paper to B, after maturity, who takes for value
and without notice, the fact that one of the obligors was a surety cannot
be shown as against B. Lewis v. Long, 102-206.
Re-opening settlement of guardian. —Where the settlement of a guardian's
account has been sanctioned by the court and assented to by the ward,
an action to re-open the same, in the absence of fraud, must be brought
within three vears after the ward's majority. Timberlake v. Green, 84658.

Partnership contract under seal. —Where a contract, entered into by an
individual and a copartnership, is reduced to writing, and signed and
sealed by the individual, and the firm name is signed, and a seal put
after it by a member of the firm, the instrument is the covenant of the
individual, and the simple contract of the firm. An action on such an
instrument is barred by the statute of limitations after three years from
the time it arose, as to the copartnership and the members thereof. Burwell v. Linthicum, 100-145.
Guaranty. —The contract of a guarantor is a separate and distinct obli
gation from that of the principal debtor, and it is immaterial that the
guaranty is written upon the same paper as the original obligation. His
liability is not that of a surety. Coleman v. Fuller, 105-328.
Bond and notes executed prior to 1868. — A note dated May, 1860, is not
affected by this provision, being excepted by \ 136, ante. Knight v.

obtained by fraud or collusion with the personal representative. Speer

105-222 ; Long v. Oxford, 108-280.

than a penalty or forfeiture, unless some other time be men
tioned in the statute creating it.
Winding up corporation. —The statutory remedy provided for the winding
of defunct corporations is exclusive of all others, and must be pursued
within three years. A failure to proceed within that period is a com
plete defence, not only to the corporation, but to the stockholders where
they are by their charter made individually liable. Von Glahn v.
DeRosset, 81-467.
Action for compensation for right-of-way. —The three years statute of
limitations (The Code, \ 155, subdivisions 2 and 3) is no bar to an
action by the owner for compensation for land taken by a railroad with
out condemnation proceedings, unless specially provided in the com
pany's charter. There is no statute of limitations provided for such pro
ceedings. Land v. Railroad, 107-72.

Continuous injury. —An action for damages for flooding land is not barred
by the lapse of three years, if the injury was continnous. Spilman v.
Roanoke Nav. Co., 74-675.
Waste. — It was error in an action for permissive waste where damages
were asked for the time elapsing from the year 1866 to 1885, when the
action was brought, to instruct the jury that no statute of limitatious
applied. The plaintiff could recover for three years. Sherrill v. Con
nor, 107-630.
(4) An action for taking, detaining, converting or injur
ing any goods or chattels, including action for their specific
recovery.
Conversion. —An action by an executor to recover the value of personal

tributee and converted by him, is barred by the lapse of three years.
Currie v. McNeil, 83-176.
Where an express trustee conveys the trust property, in breach of the
trust, and his grantee continues to hold adversely, the statute will run
in his favor. University v. Bank, 96-280.
When a trustee notifies a party for whom he holds funds that he disavows the trust and will pay the fund over to another party, and does so,
this is a conversion, and the statute of limitation begins to run, so that
the cause of action is barred in three years. Board Education v. Board
Education, 107-366.
When the statute begins to run. —In an action for tort committed in 1867,
the statute of limitations does not commence to run till January 1, 1S70.

urer with the defendant as a security for a personal loan, which deposit
was a breach of trust but was not known so to be by the defendant, and
afterwards a new treasurer of the corporation, upon inquiry, was told by
the defendant how it held the bonds, the defendant at the same time
claiming a right to hold them until the personal loan made to the
former treasurer was paid ; this amounted to a conversion of the bondii,
the possession of the defendant was adverse, and the statute of limita
tions began to run from the conversation with the new treasurer. Uni
versity v. Bank, 96-280.
Discontinuance. —Where the original summons was not served, and was
not for three years followed by appropriate successive processes, the suit
cannot relate back to the original process so as to avoid the bar of the
statute of limitations, and this is true, though an order was made by
the court to issue alias, which was neglected or disregarded by the
clerk. Etheridge v. Woodley, 83-1 1.
^
(5) An action for criminal conversation, or for any other
injury to the person or rights of another, not arising on

recover a balance admitted by a personal representative to be due lega
tees or distributees on his final account, unless he can show that he has
disposed of such balance in some way authorized by law, or unless
three years have elapsed since a demand and refusal to pay such
admitted balance. Wood}- v. Brooks, 102-334 ; modified by Kennedy
v. Cromwell, 108-1.
Whether a final account is or is not filed, if there is a demand and
refusal to account, the action is barred as to both the principal and sure
ties on au administration bond in three years, because the demand and
refusal puts an end to the trust. Kennedy v. Cromwell, 108-1.
If a final account is filed and there is a demand and refusal, the sure
ties are discharged in three years. Norman v. Walker, 101-24.
Guardian. —A guardian appointed in 1841 is not himself protected by
lapse of time against an action on his bond for an account of his trust
fund ; but his sureties are discharged if the ward does not within three
years after majority call upon the guardian for a settlement. Hodges v.
Council, 86-181.
A guardian qualified in July, 1876 ; his ward came of age in Septem
ber following ; the guardian died without having settled his trust or
making any of the returns required ; in 1887 the ward made a demand
upon, and brought suit against, the sureties on the bond : Held, that his
action was barred. Norman v. Walker, 101-24.
Under the Revised Code. —Under the Revised Code, the delay of a ward
for three years after attaining majority to have a final settlement with
his guardian, or to bring suit for any amount claimed to be due, or a
failure to notify the sureties to a guardian bond of the condition of the
estate, absolved the sureties from liability. If the right of action accrued
since the adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is subject to the
limitation therein provided. Williams v. McNair, 98-332.
Breach of the bond. —Where the administration was granted and bond
filed in November, 1870, and suit was brought against the administrator
upon a debt due from his intestate in 1876, which resulted in judgment
for the creditor in 1S79, and*this not being paid, suit was instituted on
the administration bond in June, 1881, to recover the amount due on
said judgment : Held, that the action was not barred against either the
administrator or the sureties, there not being three years failure to pay
the judgment. Reaves v. Davis, 99-425.
Where the cause of action against au executor, administrator or guar
dian is for a breach of the bond, it is barred as to the sureties after three
years from the breach complained of. Kennedy v. Cromwell, 108-1.
Commented on. —The statute protecting sureties remarked on by Smith,
C. J. Humble v. Mebane, S9-410.
Irregularity in granting injunction. —Mere irregularity in the granting of
an injunction will not prevent the suspension of the statute of limita
tions during the pendency of the injunction. Walton v. Pearson, S5-34.
Suit for distributive shares. —The statute of limitations does not run in
favor of administrators against an action of next of kin suing for distributive shares. Bushee v. Surles, 77-62. Unless the administrator has filed
his account. Vaughan v. Hines, 87-445.
(7) An action against bail, within three years after judg
ment against the principal, but bail may discharge himself
by a surrender of the principal, at any time before final
judgment against the bail.

the judgment rendered, or of the issuing of the last execu
tion therefor.
(9) An action for relief, on the ground of fraud or mis
take, the cause of action shall not be deemed to have
accrued, until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the
facts constituting such fraud or mistake.
Note.—This subsection was formerly applicable only to fraud or mis
take '• in cases which were heretofore solely cognizable by courts of
equity," but the restrictive words were stricken out by ch. 269, Acts 1889.
Where cause of action accrued prior to Act of 1879 amending this section. —
The statute of limitations barring actions for relief on the ground of
fraud after three years from the discovery of facts constituting fraud,
prior to the amendatory act of 1879, ch. 251, does not apply to a case
where no fraud, but only a mistake, is alleged. Mask v. Tiller, 89-423.
Where cause of action accrued prior to amendatory act of 1889.—This sub
jectiou applies to actions solely cognizable in the courts of equity, under
the pracnce prior to C C P. It does not apply to actions of which the
courts of law and equity had concurrent jurisdiction. Jaffray v. Bear,
103-165.
The amendatory act of 1889 does not apply to a cause pending when
it was enacted. Jaffray v. Bear, 103-165.
In 1882 defendant's intestate contracted to build a house for plaintiff's
intestate. The house was completed, turned over to, and accepted by,
plaintiff's intestate in 1883. In 1887 plaintiff sued on the contract to
recover for defective work done on the house, contrary to the terms of
the contract, which defects were not discovered until 1885: Held, (1) that
the cause of action arose at the time the house was completed and
accepted, and was barred after three years from that time ; (2) that the
action would have been at law, under the former system of practice, and
therefore did not come within the saving in subsection (9) of this section
prior to amendatory act of 1889). Burwell v. Linthicum, 100-145.
Where a debtor obtained a receipt in full from his creditor, upon pay
ing ouly twenty-five per cent, of the debt, by fraudulent representations,
and the creditor sued for the residue of his claim more than three years
after his cause of action accrued, but within three years after discovery
of the fraud: Held, that his action was barred by the statute of limita
tious. Jaffray v. Bear, 103-165 (prior to the amendatory act of 1889),
Where distributees receipt the administrator in full for their shares,
but afterwards join with the remaining distributees and an administrator
de bonis non in an action for a settlement of the first administration, the
action is barred by the three years statute of limitation, as to the dis
tributees who gave the receipts—the statute beginning to run, as to
ihem, from the date of such receipts. Coppersmith v. Wilson, 104-28.
From the discovery. —An action to secure the assets of a deceased debtor,
alleging their fraudulent disposition by the executor and others, is only
barred by the lapse of three years from the discovery thereof by the
plaintiff.' Hughes v. Whitaker, 84-640.
Where there was fraud or mistake in the terms of a deed, an action for
relief against it is not barred till the lapse of three years from the dis
covery thereof by the plaintiff. Day v. Day, 84-408.
I" an action to declare void a deed obtained upon false representations,
which were a part of the consideration tor making it, the plaintiff sought also damages for subsequent injury to the land contained therein: Held,
that such action could be maintained, and this, though it was not com
menced until two years after the discovery of the fraud, and after the
plaintiff had accepted money in compensation for certain other injuries
resulting at the same time and from the same operations. Allen v. Rail
road, 106-515.
From the act complained of and not from discovery. —This section does not
prevent the statute running in an action for fraudulent conversion of
personal property, from the conversion, and not from the discovery.
Blount v. Parker, 78-128; Spruill v. Sanderson, 79-466.
An action to falsify a guardian's account and settlement on the ground
of fraud newly discovered is barred by the lapse of three years from the
settlement. Barham v. Lomax, 73-76.
Counterclaim for fraud in sale of land in action for the purchase-money not
barred by lapse of three years. —A party entitled to rescind a contract for
the purchase of land on the ground of fraud must declare his intention
as soon as the fraud is discovered to procure a rescission, but if he should
not do so and is sued afterwards for the purchase-money he will not be
barred by the lapse of three years from the right to deduct from the debt
an amount sufficient to repair the consequences of such fraud. Knight
v. Houghtaling, 85-17.
To have purchasers declared trustees. —An action by creditors of a part
nership to hold the owners of the legal estate (who purchased the interest
of one partner) as trustees for the payment of their debts is not barred
by this section. Ross v. Henderson, 77-170.
Mutual mistake. —Qucere—Does the refusal of a party to correct a mu
tual mistake in the number of acres in a tract of land constitute fraud
within the meaning of this section ? Young v. Phifer, 72-529.
Where, in an action to recover land, the court allowed the plaintiff to
amend, so as to set up a mutual mistake in a deed, the statute only runs
against the relief demanded by the amended complaint to the time when
the action was commenced. Ely v. Early, 94-1.
Mistake. —Since the amendatory act of 1S89 an action to correct a
mistake can be brought in all cases within three years after the discov
ery. Lanning v. Commissioners, 106-505.
Payee against drawer.—Where a drawer withdraws a fund upon which
he has drawn before the presentation of his draft upon it, the statute of
limitations does not begin to run against the holder of the draft until
demand upon the drawer. Kahnweiler v. Anderson, 78-133.
Attorney and client. —Where an attorney collects money and upon a
demand refuses to pay it over, the delay of the client to bring suit
within three years after such refusal bars him of the right to maintain
an action therefor. Egerton v. Logan, 81-172.
Feme covert. —While the general rule is that an action to re-adjust a
settlement made under the jurisdiction of a court must be made in
three years, there is an exception where the settlement is made with a
feme covert. Briggs v. Smith, 83-306.
Where right of action accrued prior to C. C. P. —The statute of limitation
has no application to a case of fraud where the right of action accrued
prior to August, 1868. Batts v. Winstead, 77-238.
Note. —Probably the following should be added as a new subsection.
(10) No action for the recovery of real property sold for
the non-payment of taxes shall lie unless the same be
brought within three years after the sheriff's deed is made
as above provided : Provided, that where the owner of such
real property sold as aforesaid at the time of such sale be
a minor or insane, or convict in the penitentiary, or under
any other legal disability, three years after such disability
shall be removed shall be allowed such person, his heirs or
legal representatives to bring action. Acts 1889, ch. 218,
1 75. Acts 1891, ch. 323, § 71.
Two years.
Note.—Probably the following, though not in The Code as a part of
this chapter should, as a matter of convenience, be referred to here.
(1) Actions for legacies, etc., Code, § 151 2.
It was not necessary to wait for the lapse of two years next after
qualification before bringing an action to compel an executor to account.
Clements v. Rogers, 91-63; Godwin v. Watford, 107-168.
Where an action is brought within two years after qualification of the
administrator by the next of kin, to enforce account and distribution of
the estate, and the defendant plead that he had fully administered and
settled the estate : Held, it was not necessary to allege, to maintain
such actiou, that two years had elapsed next after the qualification of
administrator. The administrator might consent to account sooner, and
if there was no such consent, or any reasons why there should be delay,
he could set them up as defence to the action. Allen v. Royster,
107-278.
(2) Actions against counties, cities and towns, Code,
The two years' limitation upon claims against counties, cities and
towns, ch. 243, Acts i874-'75, Code, § 756, also omitted here, is con
strued to be a statute of limitation. Wharton v. Commissioners, 82-11.
8uch statute is not applicable to debts "already ascertained and
andited." Wharton v. Commissioners, 82-11.
Debts which matured and were sued on before January 1, 1877, are
not governed by this act. Hawley v. Commissioners, 82-22.
The statute. The Code, <s 756, requires all demands against munic
ipal corporations, even where they may have once been ascertained
and recognized, to be presented for payment to the proper officers,
within two years after maturity, otherwise they will be barred. Moore
v. Commissioners, 87-215 ; Royster v. Commissioners, 98-148.
By order of the county commissioners in February, 1881, L., asheriff,
executed and delivered a note to one D. for the value of his services in
building a court-house and jail. Payments were made thereon by the
sheriff and by the chairman of commissioners in March, 1882, and
afterwards the sheriff, under order of the commissioners to him as
such, paid off the balance in full, but failed, as he alleged, to have it
allowed to him in settlement with the commissioners : Held, that in an
action by L. against the commissioners for such balance, it must appear
that he presented his claim within two years after its maturity. Lanning v. Commissioners, 106-505.
(3) Penalty for usury.

The Code, § 3836.

An action to recover the penalty for usury must be brought within two
years from the time the usury was paid. Rogers v. Bank, 108-574.
(4) Purchaser of realty from the heir.

The Code, § 1442.

A purchaser from an heir or devisee with notice, although after two
years, holds the land subject to the claims of the creditors of the devisor
or ancestor. Badger v. Daniel, 79-372 ; Davis v. Perry, 96-260.
(5) Right-of-way of railroad.
A stipulation in the charter of a railroad corporation that all claims
for damages for land taken by the corporation, must be made within two
years, is a positive statute of limitations, and bars all claims not made
within that time, when the parties are sui juris. Railroad v. McCaskill, 94-746.
Although the right-of-way was located by one of the preceding com
panies in 1856 oil a tract of land, and work was done on adjacent lands,
but the road was not finished more than two years before action began
by the land-owner for damages, such owner was not barred of his rein
edy for compensation, notwithstanding he may have acquired his title
since the location. Hendrick v. Railroad, 101-617.
The statute providing that it shall be presumed that the land over
which a railroad may be constructed, together with one hundred feet on
either side thereof, has been granted by the owner, etc., provided he
does not file petition for damages in two years, applies, though the
defendant does not show that it endeavored to purchase, and failed to do
so. Gudger v. Railroad, 106-481.
The statute excepts married women and minors only as to the time
of filing petitions for damages, they being allowed two years after disa
bilities removed. More than two years having elapsed, after defendant
went into the possession of its right-of-way, before the bringing of this
action, all plaintiffs not under disabilities are barred. Gudger v. Rail
road, 106-481.
Where the charter provides that, in the absence of any contract, the
corporation acquires title to one hundred feet on each side of the track,
and if no claim for damages is brought in two years from the comple
tion of that part of the road, it is barred ; the corporation has a valid
title to the right-of-way pari passu as its track is completed. Railroad
v. McCaskill, 94-746; Purifoy v. Railroad, 108-100.
Sec. 156. One year. C. C. P., s. 35.

other public officer, for a trespass under color of his office;
(2) An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture,
where the action is given to the state alone, or in whole or
in part to the party aggrieved, or to a common informer,
except where the statute imposing it prescribes a different
limitation.
An action against a clerk of a superior court, for the penalty of fiv6
hundred dollars for failure to pay over tax fees on civil suits and fiues,
is barred by the lapse of one year. Hewlett v. Nutt, 79-263.
(3) An action for libel, assault, battery or false imprison
ment ;
(4) An action against a sheriff, or other officer, for the
escape of a prisoner arrested or imprisoned on civil pro
cess ;
(5) [An action by a creditor of any deceased person, on
whom personal notice in writing, to present his claim to
the personal representative of the deceased, has been served,
and who has failed so to do, within one year after the ser
vice of such notice ; and any such creditor, barred of a
recovery against the personal representative of a principal
debtor, by reason of such default, shall also be barred of a
recovery against the surety for such debt.]
This subsection (5) was repealed by 96, Acts 1885 and the following
probably should be substituted therefor.
(5) Damages sustained by wrongful death of any person,
The Code, § 1498.
An action by an administrator to recover damages for the death of
his intestate (under section 1498 of The Code) must be brought within
one year after the death of the intestate. The fact that no administrator
was appointed does not vary the rule, as no explanation why the action
was not brought within one year can avail. Taylor v. Iron Co., 94-525 ;
Best v. Town of Kinston, 106-205.
(6) Limitations upon right of action in contracts of
insurance, The Code, § 3076.
A stipulation in a policy of insurance, that the insured shall bring his
action for any loss "within twelve months next after the loss shall
occur" is not in contravention of the general policy of the statutes of
limitations, nor with the special statute of this State (The Code, ?3076),
which limits the powers of insurance companies to make such
stipulations or conditions to a "period less than one year from the time "
of the loss. Muse v. Assurance Co., 10S-240.
(7) Application for year's provisions, The Code, § 142S.
An application for year's support made after the expiration of twelve
months from the death of the husband is barred. Cook v. Sexton, 79-305.

Within six months—
An action for slander.
Amendment to complaint. —Where in an action for slander a new cause
of action is set up by amendment which accrued in less than six mouths
before issuing summons but more than six months before the amend
ment, such cause of action is barred. Hester v. Mullen, 107-724.
Sec. 1~>8. For other relief within ten years. C. C. P., 8. 37.
An action for relief not herein provided for must be com
menced within ten years after the cause of action shall have
accrued.
Guardian. —Senible, a guardian is protected against an action for an
account of his trust fund by the lapse of ten years, counted from the
arrival of age of each ward. Hodges v. Council, 86-186.
When there is no final account filed : Senible, that the statute begins
to run from the arrival of the ward of age, but whether in such case three
years or ten years bars, quccre. Kennedy v. Cromwell, 108-1.
Action against vendee. — In an action to recover possession by vendor
against a vendee who enters under the contract, the only statute of limi
tation applicable is that of ten years (The Code, J 15S), and it only
begins to run when the possession of vendee becomes hostile by a refu
sal t^ surrender, after demand and notice. Overman v. Jackson, 104-4.
Specific performance. —Where a vendee who was not bound in writing
to pay the purchase-money, allowed thirty years to pass before he asked
for specific performance, during all of which time he had not tendered
payment, and did not offer any excuse for his long delay, specific per
formance was refused. Love v. Welch, 97-200.
Long delay, accompanied by acts inconsistent with a purpose to per
form the contract, will, if not waived, bar the right to a specific perform
ance. Holden v. Purefoy, 10S-163; Falls v. Carpenter, 21-237.
Demand and refusal to pay amount due by final account. —When a final
account is filed and there is no demand and refusal : Qitierc, whether the
action as to the executor, administrator or guardian himself is barred
in six years or ten years. Kennedy v. Cromwell, 108-1.
Impeachment of final account. — An action to impeach the final account
of a personal representative must be brought w ithin ten years from the
filing and auditing thereof. Woody v. Brooks, 102-334.
Proceedings to declare or enforce a truBt. —An action to enforce an equita
ble right in the nature of a resulting trust, if barred at all by the statute
of limitations is only so after the lapse of ten years. Barnes v. McCullers, 108-46,
If the action (to follow funds alleged to have been fraudulently invested
in name of another) had not been barred by the provisions of subsec
tions 4 and 9 of section 155 of The Code, it would have been barred
under the general section 158, and it was not error to tell the jury that
the action was barred in ten years. Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
. Whether this section applies to an action brought by the creditors of
a partnership to hold an individual creditor of one of the partners who
received partnership land in payment of his debt liable as a trustee,
quart. Ross v. Henderson, 77-170.
leave to i>»ue execution.—The statute is a complete bar to a motion for
leave to issue execution on a judgment rendered more than ten years
previous. McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248.
Divorce.—Qucere, whether this section prescribes the limitation upon
evidence of ill treatment in actions for divorce a mensaei thoro. Smith
v. Smith, 72-139.
Impeachment of final account.—An administrator filed his final account,
ex parte, before the clerk of the superior court in May, 1879, which
account showed a balance in favor of the administrator. The plaintiff
sued in April, 1888, as one of the next of kin, to have the account
restated. The defendant administrator pleaded the six year statute of
limitation as a bar to the account : Held, that such statute did not
apply, and an order for a reference to state the account was proper.
Woody v. Brooks, 102-334.
Impeachment of judgment for fraud,—A judgment obtained by fraud is
not, strictly speaking, the judgment of the court. Reasonable dili
gence and good faith are required in applications for relief in such pro
ceedings. Grantham v. Kennedy, 91-148.
Action against administrator to recover sum due by final account. —The
administrator of A. filed an ex parte final account in May, 1875, show
ing a balance due the next of kin. The administrator died in April,
1883. In May, 1883, the plaintiff qualified as his executor, and in September, 1884, beg;
ke real estate assets, to which
the administrator de bonis non of A. became a party, and filed a com
plaint to recover the amount due on said final account: Held, that the
date when the action of the administrator de bonis non was commenced
was the date when the summons issued in the special proceeding to
make real estate assets, and that the statute of limitations (The Code,
j 158) did not bar the action. Wyrick v. Wyrick, 106-84.
Unreasonable delay. —Where trustees might, within a reasonable time,
and upon proper application, have had the fund secured for the purposes
of the trust, but having neglected for over twenty years to enforce any
remedies they may have had in that respect, they are barred by the stat
ute of limitations. Newton Academy v. Bank, 101-483.
In 1869 an administrator, in proceedings pending in the probate court,
resigned, with the permission of the court, and an administrator de bonis
non was appointed and duly qualified. In 1887, the next of kin of the intesfate brought an action on the bond of the original administrator, alleg
ing breaches of the bond, and for an account and settlement : Held,
that accepting the resignation of the administrator and appointing his
successor, having been done in proceedings duly instituted, and there
having been no exceptions filed or appeal taken, it was too late to disturb the judgment of the probate court after the lapse of nearly twenty
years. Tulburt v. Hollar, 102-406.
Where the heirs and the next of kin allowed six years during the life
of the administrator to elapse, and waited twelve years for an adminis
trator de bonis non to be appointed, and no effort was made to procure a
settlement of the estate, the law will not help them, except in cases pre
scribed by statute. Brittain v. Dickson, 104-547.
Where plaintiff had notice of the registration of the mesne convey
ances, and of possession of defendants under them for fifteen years, and
all this time and for eight years after paying the debt secured by the
deed, be failed to register the defeasance or assert his claim : Held, he
was guilty of gross negligence, and not entitled to the relief of a court
of equity. Waters v. Crabtree, 105-394.
There is no statute of limitations to an action by citizens to test the
validity of an election held to ascertain the will of the people upon a
subscription to a railroad, but it must be brought within a reasonable
time. Jones v. Com'rs, 107-248.
No presumption of abandonment. —Where a party having an equitable
title to land, remains in possession, no presumption can arise of abandon
ment of his equity. Thornburg v. Mastin, 93-25S.
0
Where cause of action accrued prior to C. C. P. —Where the right of action
of a cestui que trust against a trustee accrued prior to the adoption of the
C. C. P., the case is governed by the limitation then existing, and if
there was none, then by the principles of the court of equity applicable
to such cases. Gibbett v. Maultsby, 71-345.
Where the right of action against an administration bond accrued prior
to C. C. P., the statute of presumptions began to run from the time he
filed bis account, and the next of kin would be barred by the lapse of ten
vears. Hodges v. Council, S6-181 ; Vaughan v. Hines, 87-445 > Ivey v.
Cox, 16-58.
An action to attach a parol trust to a legal estate or convert a deed
absolute on its face into a security where the cause of action arose prior
to the present Code was not barred by any statute of limitation and the
ten years statute of presumption applied. Summerlin v. Cowles, 101-473.
See cases cited under § 151, ante.
Sec. 150. Limitations to apply to actions by the state. C.
C. P., s. 38.
The limitations prescribed in this chapter shall apply to
civil actions brought in the name of the state, or for its
benefit, in the same manner as to actions by or for the
benefit of private parties.
If the moneys are public moneys, it is the clerk's duty to pay them over
at once to the proper authorities, and his failure to do so is a breach of his
bond, and an action may be commenced without demand. In such case
the statute begins to run from the date of the receipt of the moneys.
Furman v. Timberlake, 93-66.
Sec. 160. Actions upon an account current, when cause
accrues. C. C. P., s. 39.
In an action brought to recover a balance due upon a
mutual open and current account, where there have been
reciprocal demands between the parties, the cause of action
shall be deemed to have accrued from the time of the latest
item proved in the account, on either side.
Banning account —mutual, —The statute of limitations 1 wis only from the
ilate of the last item in a mutual running account where each party
keeps a running account of debits and credits, or where one, with the
knowledge of the other, keeps it. Mauney v. Coit, 86-463.
In order to constitute a mutual running account, there must be an
understanding or agreement between the parties, express or implied,
from the nature of the dealings, that the items of an account be applied
as payments upon the others. Mere disconnected and opposing demands
are not sufficient. The statute of limitations begins to run from the date
of the last item of the account. Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394.
Running account—not mutual. —Where there is a running account, all on
one side, the statute of limitations begins to run on each item from its
date. Robertson v. Pickrell, 77-302.
Sec. 101. When action deemed commenced. C. C. P., ». 40.
An action is commenced as to each defendant when the
summons is issued against him.
Discontinuance. —In order to bar the statute of limitations by issuing
summons, the successive summonses (if not served) must be issued with
out omission, else they will only relate back to the first summons after
the break, and this though there was an order of the court, but not
obeyed, for an alias at the time of the break. Etheridge v. Woodley,
83-11 ; Penniman v. Daniel, 91-431.
Sec. 162. Time for commencement of action, or enforce
ment of judgment against defendant out of the Mate.
C. C. P., s. 41. 1881, c. 258, ss. 1, 2.
If, when the cause of action accrue or judgment be ren
dered or docketed against any person, he shall be out of
the state, such action may be commenced, or judgment
enforced, within the time herein respectively limited, after
the return of such person into this state, and if, after such
cause of action shall have accrued or judgment rendered or
docketed, such person shall depart from and reside out of
this state, or remain continuously absent therefrom for the
space of one year or more, the time of his absence shall
not be deemed or taken as any part of the time limited for
the commencement of such action, or the enforcement of
such judgment.
This section shall apply to all actions that have accrued
and judgments rendered, transferred or docketed since the
24th day of August, 1868.
Applies to non-resident debtors. —The provisions of this section apply to
to the obligations of non-residents as much as to those of residents of
this state. Armfield v. Moore, 97-34.
Debt contracted out of the state. —Where a debtor is out of the state at
the time the cause of action accrues, the statute of limitation does not
begin to run until he returns to this state for the purpose of making it
his residence. Armfield v. Moore, 97-34.
Where debtor occasionally visits the state. —Where the debtor was a non
resident of this state, but was here on visits of a day or two each year,
such visits would not have the effect of putting the statute in motion,
and the cause of action will not be barred, although more than the time
required to bar it has elapsed since the cause of action accrued.
Armfield v. Moore, 97-34.
Where debtor leaves the state without changing his domicile. —Where, after
the cause of action has accrued, the debtor leaves this state and is con
tinually absent for one year or more, although he may not have changed
his domicile, the time of his absence shall not be counted on a plea of
the statute. Armfield v. Moore, 97-34.
Where debtor leaves and resides out of the Btate. —Where, after the cause
of action accrues, the debtor leaves this state and resides out of it, the
time of his absence from this state shall not be taken as any part of the
time limited for the commencement of the action. Armfield v. Moore,
97-34Where the cause of action accrued prior to C. C. P. —This section does not
apply to causes of action existing before the adoption of the C. C. P. in
1868. Blue v. Gilchrist, 84-239; Campbell v. Brown, 86-376.
In such cases the non-residence alone of the obligor is not sufficient
to rebut the presumption of payment arising from the lapse of time,
though evidence of that fact is competent in support of other proof,
such as insolvency, to rebut the presumption of payment. Alston v.
Hawkins, 105-3.
Sec. 103. Exceptions, persona under disabilities. C. CP.,
s. 142.
If a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in the
last chapter, except for a penalty or forfeiture, or against
a sheriff or other officer for an escape, be at the time the
cause of action accrued, either—
(1) Within the age of twenty-one years ; or
Ward,—Must sue sureties or guardian within three years after becom
ing of age. Norman v. Walker, 101-24.
(2) Insane ; or
Insane.—Action must be brought in three years after insanity is
removed. Warlick v. Plonk, 103-S1.
(3) Imprisoned on a criminal charge, or in execution
under the sentence of a criminal court for a term less than
his natural life ; or
(4) A married woman ;
Then such person may bring his action within the times
before limited, after the disability shall be removed.
Feme covert.—The provision of the C. C. P., which allows afeme covert
to sue or be sued concerning her personal property, does not remove
the disability of coverture so as to allow the statute of limitations to bar
a feme covert's right of action. Lippard v. Troutman, 72-55 ; Smith v.
Briggs, 83-306. See also sees. 148 and 149, ante.
Where the land of afeme covert has been conveyed without her privy
examination, there is no adverse possession against her issue, notwith standing she predeceased her husband, until after the death of her hus
band. Kincaid v. Perkins, 63-282.
Where in a suit on a guardian bond, one of the plaintiffs, a feme covert,
arrived at full age in 1S65, married in 1867, and commenced the suit in
1876 : Held, that the statute did not bar her right to recover. The inter
val of two years between the termination of the disability of infancy
and the commencement of that of coverture, is bridged over by the act
suspending the operation of the statute from May, 1865, to January,
1870. Davis v. Perry, S9-420.
There is 110 saving clause of disability for femes covert as to the pre
sumption of abandonment of equitable rights. R. C, ch. 65, (Jig;
Summerlin v. Cowles, 101-473.
Cumulative disability. —When two or more disabilities co-exist, or when
one disability shall supervene an existing one, the period prescribed
within which an action may be brought shall not begin to run until the
expiration of the latest disability. Campbell v. Carter, 95-156.
Disability to exist when right of action accrues. —It must appear that the
parties were under disability when the right of action accrued. See
\ 169. Gudger v. Railroad, 106-481.
Sec. 104. Death of a person entitled before limitation
expires ; action on claims filed by administrator, etc , and
admitted, not. barred, etc., applicable to claims already
tiled. V. C. P., 8. 43. 1881, c. SO.
If a person entitled to bring an action die before the
expiration of the time limited for the commencement thereof,
and the cause of action survive, an action may be com
menced by his representatives after the expiration of that
time, and within one year from his death. If a person
against whom an action may be brought die before the
expiration of the time limited for the commencement
thereof, and the cause of action survive, an action may be
commenced against his personal representative after the
expiration of that time, and within one year after the issu
ing of letters testamentary or of administration. Rut if
the claim upon which such cause of action is based be filed
with the personal representative within the time above
specified, and the same shall be admitted by him, it shall
not be necessary to bring an action upon such claim to
prevent the bar: Provided, that no action shall be brought
against the personal representative upon such claim after
his final settlement ; and this shall apply to claims already
filed.
The provisions of this section apply only to an action
where the plaintiff or defendant dies before the expiration of the time
limited. Yaughan v. Hines, 87-445.
When the party to be sued dies, suit can be begun after the lapse of
the time limited within one year after issuing of letters testamentary or
of administration. Dunlap v. Hendley, 92-115.
Time counted from the death of the decedent, in respect to claims in
favor of the estate, because the law does not encourage remissness in
those entitled to administration. Coppersmith v. Wilson, 107-31.
Actions upon claims in favor of an estate of a decedent must be brought
within one year of his death, without regard to when administrator is
appointed. Actions upon claims against the estate of a decedent must
be brought in one year after administration. Coppersmith v. Wilson,
107-31.
Death of administrator. —Where the period of two years elapsed from
the death, or removal, of an administrator and the appointment of his
successor, and the latter began his action within one year after his quali
ficatiou : Held, that this was within the spirit of section 164 of The Code,
and the time intervening between the two administrations should not be
computed. Smith v. Brown, 99-377; lb., 101-347.
Where judgment debtor dies. —Where a judgment debtor dies within ten
years alter the rendition of the judgment, an action can be brought after
the lapse of ten years upon the judgment, against the personal repre
sentative, if within one year after the grant of administration. Mauney
v. Holmes, 87-428.
A justice's judgment, though docketed in the superior court, being
barred as a causa litis by the lapse at seven years, the death of the debtor
after the lapse of seven years (but before the lapse of ten years) does not
give the plaintiff the right to sue on the judgment under the provisions
of this section within one year after the grant of administration. Daniel
v. Laughlin, 87-433.
The statute governing the presentation of claims to an administrator
applies also when the claim has been reduced to judgment ; and when
judgment was obtained and docketed in 1869 against an administrator,
and no effort was made to assert this claim until 1886, it was barred by
the ten years statute of limitation, unless the claim was admitted by the
administrator, or action was brought upon it in one year after the expi
ration of the ten years on the appointment of administrator as prescribed
by statute. Erittain v. Dickson, 104-547.
Admission by administrator. —Where the plaintiff told the administrator
several times that the deceased owed him, but the administrator never
said whether he would pay it or not, this is not an admission which pre
vents the statute from running. Fleming v. Fleming, 85-127.
A simple admission by an executor of the correctness of a claim against
the testator's estate, and a verbal promise to pay the same out of the
assets, will not stop the running of the statute of limitations, unless the
creditor refrained from suing at the request of the executor, or there was
an agreement for indulgence. Whitehurst v. Dey, 90-542.
When the creditor presented his claim against the estate of deceased
person within one year, the same not being then barred by the statute
of limitations, and the administrator, without having admitting its cor
rectness in terms, filed his petition to make assets to pay the debts of
the estate : Held, that the defendants in such proceedings could not be
allowed to set up the statute of limitations in resistance to this claim.
Woodlief v. Bragg, 108-571.
Claims not barred presented to the administrator in one year after let
ters granted and admitted by him, need not be put in suit to prevent the
bar of the statute pending the administration, nor can the heirs plead
the statute as to them. Turner v. Shuffler, 108-642.
Action for money received by deceased within three years prior to death. —
An action for money had and received can be maintained where it was
received by the intestate within three years of her death, and the action
was brought within one year after the grant of administration upon her
estate. Robertson v. Dunn, 87-191.
Where cause .of action accrued prior to C. C. P. —This section does not
apply where the cause of action accrued before the adoption of C. C. P.
Hall v. Gibbs, 87-4.
The death of the surety and the lapse of a time longer than that pre
scribed in the statute before the qualification of a personal representa
tive, did not suspend the operation of the statute, if the wards could,
during that time, have proceeded against the guardian. Williams v.
McNair, 98-332.
The period elapsing between the death of the maker of a bond and
the qualification of his personal representative, must be excluded in
computing the time when the statute of presumptions is relied upon as
a defence, but the rule is different with respect to the time elapsing
between the death of the payee and the appointment of his administra
tor. Baird v. Reynolds, 99-469.
Presumption of death. —The presumption of death arises from the
absence of a person for seven years without being heard from. Dowd
v. Watson, 105-476.
Sec. 105. Actions by aliens, time of war not counted. C. C.
r., s. 44.
When a person shall be an alien, subject or citizen of a
country at war with the United States, the time of the con
tinuance of the war shall not be part of the period limited
for the commencement of the action.
Sec. 166. When judgment reversed, etc., plaintiff may com
mence new action. V. C. l'.,s. 45.
If an action shall be commenced within the time pre
scribed therefor, and the plaintiff be nonsuited, or a judg
ment therein be reversed on appeal, or be arrested, the
plaintiff, or if he die and the cause of action survive, his
heir or representative, may commence a new action within
one year after such nonsuit, reversal or arrest of judgment.
Judgment dismissing an action. —A judgment dismissing an action has
the same legal effect as a nonsuit, and a new action may be brought in
one year thereafter, the bar of the statute not running during that time.
Straus v. Beardsley, 79-59; Wharton v. Com'rs, 82-11. Compare, also,
Skillington v. Allison, 9-34"; Morrison v. Connelley, 13-233 ; Long v.
Orrell, 35-123, and Freshwater v. Baker, 52-255.
An action dismissed for a cause not involving merits, like a nonsuit,
does not deprive the plaintiff of the right to bring a new suit for the
same cause of action. Halcombe v. Com'rs, 89-346.
Where husband and wife bring an action for services rendered to the
wife's father, and are nonsuited, and the husband, within twelve months,
brings another action alone, he is not bound by the statute of limita
tions. Whetstine v. Wilson, 104-3K5.
Where the judgment debtor made a motion, within ten years from
docketing judgment, for leave to issue execution thereon, which was
denied, and thereupon, within one year after such denial, but more than
ten years from the date of docketing, he brought an action on the judg
ment, the action was barred by the statute of limitations, this section
not being applicable to the facts. Mcllheuny v. Trust Co., 108-31 1.
Action defeated for defect of parties. —Where one partner brings suit in
his own name on a partnership claim, and is defeated for non-joinder of
other partners, he may bring another suit on the same cause in the name
of the firm within a year, though the latter suit would have been barred
by the statute if it had been the beginning of the litigation. Martin v.
Young, 85-156. See £ 142, ante, as to actions for realty.
Sec. 107. Time of stay by injunction, <fc, not counted. C.
C. P., s. 40.
When the commencement of an action shall be stayed byinjunction or statutory prohibition, the time of the contin
uance of the injunction or prohibition shall not be part of
the time limited for the commencement of the action.
Judgment. —The time during which the judgment creditor was restrained
by the operation of the appeal is not to be counted, as the appeal had
the effect to prevent the issuing of execution within the time prescribed.
Adams v. Guy, 106-275.
Irregularity. —Mere irregularity in the granting of an injunction will
not prevent the suspension of the statute of limitations during the pen
dency of the injunction. Walton v. Pearson, 85-34.
Sec. 10S. Time during controversy about probate of will,
tSc, not counted. C. C. P., s. 47.
In reckoning time, when pleaded as a bar to actions, that
period shall not be counted which elapses during any con
troversy on the probate of a will or grautingjletters of
administration, unless there be an administrator appointed
during the pendency of the action, and it be provided that
an action may be brought against him.
Sec. 109. Disability must exist when the right of action
accrued. C. C. P., s. 48.
No person shall avail himself of a disability, unless it
existed when his right of action accrued.
Disability when right of action accrues must be shown. —As to the parties
laboring under disabilities, it ought to have appeared that they were so
when the statute began to run. Gudger v. Railroad, 106-481.
Subsequent marriage. —When the statute begins to ruu, the subsequent
marriage of the feme plaintiff will not stop it. Kennedy v. Cromwell,
108-1.
Heirs and devisees. —When the statute of limitations commences to run
against the ancestor or devisor, it continues to run against the heir or
devisee, even though the right of action may, on the next day after it
accrues, pass from the ancestor or devisor to an heir or devisee under
disability. Chancer v. Powell, 103-159.
If the statute of limitations commences to ruu, nothing stops it. When
it begins to run against the ancestor, it continues to run against the heir,
although the heir is under disability when the descent is cast. Frederick
v. Williams, 103-189.
Mortgagee sold the mortgaged land, bought it himself, and entered
into adverse possession in the life-time of mortgagor, i. e., on January 1 ,
1S74; which adverse possession has continued ever since. Mortgagor
died January 1, 1883; there has never been any administration on his
estate ; in June, 1887, his infant heirs sued the mortgagee for redemp
tion : Held, that the action is barred under The Code, V/, 152 (4), 148 and
169. Frederick v. Williams, 103-189.
Sec. 170. Where several disabilities, all must be removed.

tion. C. V. P., s. ~>0.
No act, admission or acknowledgment by any partner
after the dissolution of the copartnership, or by any of the
makers of a promissory note or bond after the statute of
limitation shall have barred the same, shall be received as
evidence to repel the statute, except against the partner or
maker of the promissory note or bond doing the act or
making the admission or acknowledgment.
Allowance of set-off. —An allowance and entry of set-off, made on the
bond by the obligee without the privity of the obligor, will not remove
the bar of the statute. Woodhouse v. Simmons, 73-30.
Judgment against one of several obligors. —A judgment suffered by one
of several obligors is not an acknowledgment binding on the other
obligors. Lane v. Richardson, 79-159.
Partial payment. —A partial payment by the principal before the claim
is barred stops the running of the statute as to the sureties also. Green
v. Greensboro, 83-449
Where a payment upon a claim is made before it is barred by one of
several obligors of the same class, it arrests the statute of limitation as
to all of them, but not as to others of a different class. Wood v. Barber,
90-76.
Dissolution of partnership. —In an action against a copartner for an
account, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the
dissolution of the copartnership, unless there is some agreement
expressed or implied to the contrary, or some circumstances that render
a settlement impossible. Murray v. Penny, 108-324.
Where canse of action accrued prior to C. C. P. —Where the cause of
action accrued prior to C C P. this section does not apply, Woodhouse
v. Simmons, 73-30; Lane v. Richardson, 79-159.
To rebut presumption of payment, the admissions of the maker and
his administrator are both competent ; but the mere admission of the
administrator that he had not paid it would not be sufficient to rebut
the presumption as to his intestate. Grant v. Gooch, 105-278.
.Sec. 172. Acknowledgment or new promise must be in
writing. C. CP., a. 51.
No acknowledgment or promise shall be received as evi
dence of a new or continuing contract, whereby to take the
case out of the operation of this title, unless the same be
contained in some writing signed by the party to be charged
thereby ; but this section shall not alter the effect of any
payment of principal or interest.
Doee not apply to judgments. —A promise in writing or an actual pay
ment will not repel the statute of limitations as to a judgment, it not
being a contract. McDonald v. Dickson, 87-404.
Partial payment. —The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show
that it was made within such a period that the time elapsed thereafter
had not barred the action when suit was brought. Riggs v. Roberts,
85-151.
The effect of this section is to leave the law as it was prior to the
adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure as regards the effect of a par
tial payment in removing the bar of the statute of limitations. Bank
v. Harris, 96-118.
When partial payment does not revive the liability. —The presumption of a
recognition of the debt arising from a partial payment can be rebutted
bythe attending circumstances of other sufficient evidence of a contrary
intent Hewlett v. Schenck, 82-234.
Partial payment by assignee in bankruptcy. —Where the cause of action
accrued prior to the adoption of C C P., a payment on a bond within
ten years after it falls due by the assignee in bankruptcy of one of the
obligors, repels the presumption arising from the lapse of time as to all
the obligors. Belo v. Spach, 85-122.

Partial payment by the principal. —A payment by the principal before
claim is barred stops the running of the statute as to the sureties also.
Green v. Greensboro, 83-449.
Partial payment by surety. —Where the administrator of a creditor drew
an order on two of the sureties to a promissory note, and credited the
amount of such order on the note, which order was paid by one of the
sureties after the note was barred by the lapse of time, this was a pay
ment on the note, and prevented the bar of the statute of limitation as
to the surety making the payment, and the intention of the debtor,
uncommunicated to the administrator, to apply the payment to another
debt, cannot affect the application. Long v. Miller, 93-233.
Promise by an administrator. —The promise of an administrator to pay a
debt of his intestate, which is barred by the statute, is invalid unless in
writing and signed. Fleming v. Fleming, 85-127.
Promise by one of several joint obligors. —The promise to pay a bond,
made by one of the joint obligors, will uot bind the other or deprive
him of the benefit of the presumption of payment from the lapse of time.
Campbell v. Brown, 86-376.
Judgment suffered by one of several obligors. —A judgment suffered by a
joint obligor is not a waiver of the statute as to his co-obligor. Lane v.
Richardson, 79-159.
,
The new promise must be distinct, unconditional and specific—A mere
acknowledgment of a debt, though implying a promise to pay, will not
revive it. Riggs v. Roberts, 85-151: Faison v. Bowden, 76-425.
A new promise must be unconditional, and in writing, signed by the
party. Greenleaf v. Railroad, 91-33.
A new promise, to repel the bar of the statute of limitations, must be
clear, positive and distinctly refer to the debt sued upon. It must be
made to the party, his agent or attorney. A promise to a third party
will not be recognized. Upon causes of action accruing since the adop
tion of the Code of Civil Procedure, the new promise must be in writing.
Hussey v. Kirkman, 95-63.
An acknowledgment that the contract sued upon was correct, and a
promise by the obligor that it should be paid as soon as he could sell
some stock and make collections, is a conditional promise, and will not
obstruct the running of the statute. Bates v. Herren, 95-3S8.
A written acknowledgment, or new promise, certain in its terms, or
which can be made certain, is sufficient to repel the operations of the
statute of limitations. Long v. Oxford, 104-408.
An unaccepted offer. —An unaccepted offer to discharge the bond by a
conveyance of land is not such a recognition of an existing liability as
will imply a promise to pay the debt. Riggs v. Roberts, S5-151.
New promise must be in writing. —Where the cause of action accrued
prior to The Code, the new promise, if made to any other than original
creditor, if made since the C. C. P., must be in writing. Fleming v.
Statou, 74-203 ; Pool v, Bledsoe, 85-1 ; Hussey v. Kirkman, 95-63 ; Greenleaf v. Railroad, 91-33 ; Bates v. Herren, 95-388.
Offer to submit to judgment. —When, after the statute of limitations was
pleaded in an action on an account, the defendant wrote plaintiff, offer
ing to submit to a judgment for a smaller amount than that claimed, this
is a waiver of the statute and a new promise to the extent of such smaller
sum. Pope v. Andrews, 90-401.
When action delayed by request of debtor. —Where delay in bringing suit is
caused by the request of the defendant, and his promise to pay the debt
and not to avail himself of the plea of the statute, he will not be allowed
to plead it, as this would be against equity and good conscience ;
but, in such case, the creditor must bring his action within three years
after such promise and request for delay. Haymore v. Com'rs, 85-268 ;
Joyner v. Massey, 97-148; Barcroft v. Roberts, 91-363; Daniels v.
Com'rs, 74-494.
By 8mith, C J. — In such case the request of the defendant for delay
and his promise not to avail himself of the statute must be in writing,
as provided by i, 172 of The Code, except in cases where it would enable
the defendant to perpetrate a fraud. Joyner v. Massey, 97-148.
By Merrimon, J. —The right of the creditor to have the debtor
restrained from setting up the statute where suit has been delayed at
the debtor's instance, is not affected by \ 172 of The Code, and need not
be in writing. Ibid.
The indulgence of a debtor by the creditor, at the special request of
the debtor, will not prevent the running of the statute of limitations.
To prevent the statute being a bar, there must be an agreement express
or implied, on the part of the debtor, that he will not plead the statute
Hill v. Hilliard, 103-34.
Evidence ofpayment. —While the recognition of a subsisting indebtedness
by the personal representative, and the promise to pay the same, is not
sufficient to revive a cause of action barred by a positive statute of limi
tation, yet it is competent to be considered in passing upon the issue of
payment, and is sufficient to rebut the presumption of payment having
been made. Tucker v. Baker, 94-162.
When new promise need not be in writing.—Where the cause of action
accrued prior to the C C P., the new promise need not be in writing.
I-aisou v. Bowden, 74-43.
Promise to pay a debt discharged in bankruptcy. —The verbal promise of a
bankrupt after his discharge to pay a note executed before the adjudica
tion of bankruptcy, is binding. Hornthal v. McRae, 67-21 ; Fraley v.
Kelly, 67-78 ; Henley v. Lanier, 75-172 ; Fraley v. Kelly, 79-348 ; Kull
v. Farmer, 78-339.
Hew promise to an agent of the creditor. —A promise to pay a debt dis
charged in bankruptcy, made to an agent of the creditor, is a promise to
the creditor himself. Shaw v. Burney, 86-331.
Hew promise to a stranger. —An acknowledgment or promise to a
stranger, one having no privity or community with the creditor, has no
validity. Faison v. Bowden, 76-42.5; Parker v. Shuf'ord, 76-219; Hus
ky v. Kirkman, 95-63.
lew promise to the attorney of the creditor. —A promise made to the attor
ney of the creditor is sufficient. Kirby v. Mills, 78-124.
Endorsement of credits. —Where credits endorsed on a bond are relied
on to take the case out of the statute, the plaintiff must establish that
they were put there at the dates specified, and this is so, though the
credits are admitted to be in the handwriting of the obligee. Grant v.
Burgwyn, 84-560.
Where credits endorsed on a bond are relied ou to repel the presump
non of payment, the plaintiff must establish by proof aliunde the entry
of payment that the same was made before the presumption arose.
White v. Beaman, 85-3.
The fact that the maker of a note has a claim against the holder,
which the holder endorses as a credit on the note without the assent of
the maker, will not be such a partial payment as will rebut the statute
of limitations, but an agreement to apply one existing liability to
another, is such a partial payment as will stop the operation of the stat
ute, although the endorsement is never actually made on the note
Bank v. Harris, 96-118.
Action should be on the original obligation. —An action cannot be main
tained on a new promise to pay a debt secured by a bond, while the bond
is still in force. King v. Phillips, 94-555.
Prior to C. C. P. —Where the cause of action accrued prior to C C P..
this section will not apply, but the statutes previously in force. Simonton v. Clark, 65-525.
Sec. 17!t. Co-tenants, when some barred, others not. C.C.
p., s.
In actions by tenants in common or joint tenants of per
sonal property to recover the same, or damages for the
detention of or injury thereto, and any of them shall be
barred of their recovery by limitation of time, the rights of
the others shall not be affected thereby ; but they may
recover according to their right and interest, notwithstand
ing such bar.

bills, ,&c, C. C. P. sec. 5.V. 1S74-'5, c. 170.

stockholders of any moneyed corporation or banking asso
ciation incorporated under the laws of this state, to recover

the liability was created.

CLARK'S CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.

Stockholders. —The three years statute of limitations begins to run
against the private stockholders of a bank, upon the personal liability
clause of the charter, from the date the bank suspends payment ; and
this whether the assets of the corporation are exhausted or not. Long
v. Bank, 90-405.
Sec. 176. Certain units against hanks barred. C. C. P., s.
r>4 (a), 1872, c. 120.
Whereas, many citizens of the state of North Carolina
were stockholders in banking institutions chartered in other
states before the year one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-one, which contain individual liability clauses in the
nature of penalties, in the event of failure on the part of
said banking corporations to meet their liabilities ; and
Whereas, said banking corporations have become insol
vent by the results of the late war, thereby entailing upon
the stockholders the loss of the investment of their capital
therein, and they are threatened with further loss by reason
of said individual liability clauses; therefore,
All such causes of action as have not hitherto been com
menced in this state against citizens thereof, are hereby
declared to be barred by lapse of time.
Sec. 177. Action to be by party in interest; action by
grantee of land held adversely ; assignment of thing in
action. C. V. P., s, US. 187i-'5, c. 2S(i, s. 1.
Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real
party in interest, except as otherwise provided ; but this sec
tion shall not be deemed to authorize the assignment of a
thing in action not arising out of contract. But an action
may be maintained by a grantee of real estate in his own
name, whenever he or any grantor or other person through
whom he may derive title, might maintain such action,
notwithstanding the grant of such grantor or other convey
ance be void, by reason of the actual possession of a person
claiming under a title adverse to that of such grantor, or
other person, at the time of the delivery of such grant or
other conveyance. In the case of an assignment of a thing
in action the action by the assignee shall be without preju
dice to any set-off or other defence existing at the time of,
or before notice of, the assignment ; but this section shall
not apply to a negotiable promissory note or bill of
exchange, transferred in good faith and upon good consid
eration, before due.

Action npon official bonds. —This section does not dispense with the
requirement that suits upon official bonds made payable to the state
must be brought in the name of the state. Carmichael v. Moore,
88-29.
The commissioners of a county are proper relators to sue upon the
official bond of a county treasurer to recover the county school fund,
Commissioners v. Magnin, 86-285; Commissioners v. Magnin, 78-181.
An action upon a county treasurer's bond to recover an account
alleged to be due the county, must be brought on the relation of the
commissioners, and not by the succeeding treasurer. Wescott v. Thees,
89-55The chairman of the fence commission to whom a fund is payable,
though not named in the bond, may maintain the action under the pro
visions of The Code, \ 1891, (and it is intimated that he might have
maintained it independently of those provisions), against the tax-col
lector for failure to pay over the fund. Speight v. Staton, 104-44.
Action between counties. —When tax-payers in one of the counties of a
fence district have paid more than their proportion of the tax to build the fence, the county commissioners of that county are the proper par
ties to bring suit to recover the excess, and when collected they will
retain it as a special credit to each of such tax-payers in a general col
lection of county taxes. Commissioners of Green v. Commissioners of
Lenoir, 92-180.
Action against superior court clerk. —The county treasurer is the proper
plaintiff in an action on the bond of the superior court clerk to recover
money collected by him as taxes on suits. Hewlett v. Nutt, 79-263.

the proper relator in an action upon the guardian bond. McKinnon v.
McKinnon, 81-201.
Action on guardian and administration bonds. —Actions upon the bonds of
guardians, administrators, executors and collectors must be brought in
the name of the State. Norman v. Walker, 101-24.
The objection that an action upon an administrator's bond was not
brought in the name of the state must be made in apt time. Brown v.
McKee, 108-387.
The share of an infant in an estate in the hands of his guardian is
capable of being assigned, and when so assigned, the assignee, and not
the infant, is the proper relator in an action on the guardian bond. Petty
v. Rousseau, 94-355Suit on note payable to guardian " as guardian."—The administrator of a
guardian cannot sue on a note payable to the guardian "as guardian,"
unless on a settlement the note has become the property of his intestate.
Alexander v. Winston, 81-191.

guardian cannot maintain a suit on the bond of a clerk and master for a
sum due the ward of such deceased guardian. Davis v. Fox, 69-435.

his own name on a bond which he had passed without endorsement to a
distributee of the estate of his intestate. Setzer v. Lewis, 69-133.

tor and the proper party plaintiff in an action to recover the assets of
the estate. Grant v. Bell, 87-34.

assets in the hands of a former administrator or executor must be prose
cuted by an administrator de bonis non. Goodman v. Goodman, 72-508 ;

Mills, 91-131 ; Merrill v. Merrill, 92-657; Turlbut v. Hollar, 102-407;
Gilliam v. Watkins, 104-180.
Administrator cum testamento annexo. — Where a testator living in another
state left a will which was admitted to probate in that state and also in
this, gave a sum of money to A, in trust for the benefit of B, both of this
state, the interest to be paid to B during her life, and at her death the
trustee to distribute the principal, according to her judgment, for the
benefit of the poor of the county where A and B lived, and the executor
who qualified in the state of testator's domicile paid over the amount of
legacy to the trustee, who deposited a part of it with the defendant's
brokers, who lived in this state, and A having died without disposing of
the sum so deposited, and B having never died : Held, that an adminis
trator cum testamento annexo in this state could not sustain an action
for that sum against the brokers. If entitled to the possession of the
fund at all, his remedy would have been against the personal representa
tive of the trustee, and not against the defendants, who were his agents.
With the parties then before the court, it was error to adjudge a final
disposition of the fund, and the action should have been dismissed
McKoy v. Guirkin, io2-21.

possession of the crop, and is the "party in interest" to bring suit for it
Bridgers v. Dill, 97-202.
Substituted trustee under Code, Jj 1276. —Where the trustee, in a convey
ance to secure creditors, died before fully administering the trust, ami
another person is appointed trustee under the statute the substituted trus
tee can maintain an action against the personal representatives, heirs at
law or devisees of the deceased trustee for such portion of the trust
estate as the original trustee was seized or possessed of at his death. In
such action it is not proper to make creditors of the trustee, whose
demands were contested, parties, as they are not necessary to the settle
ment of the only issue raised, viz., the amount and custody of the
unadministered trust estate. Warren v. Howard, 99-190.
Trustee with an interest. —Where a note is handed to a party without
endorsement by the payee to collect, and out of the money, when col
lected, to pay himself a debt which the payee owed him and pay the
balance to the payee, such party is entitled to sue upon the note. Willey v. Galling, 70-410.
Cestui que trust. —When property is conveyed to trustees with power
to make repairs, the cestui que trust is not a necessary party to proceed
ings to enforce a mechanic's lien therefor. Cheatham v. Rowland, 92-340.

Commissioner. —Where a commissioner, appointed to conduct a jndicial
sale, was directed to sell for cash, and did so, except that one of the pur
chasers did not immediately pay his bid, the commissioner may main
tain an independent action in his own name to recover the amount of
the bid. Lackey v. Pearson, 101-651.
Action for penalty. —The person claiming the penalty, and not the state,
is the proper party plaintiff in an action for the penalty imposed on
railroads by ij 1967 of The Code. Middleton v. Railroad, 95-167.
Where the statue allows an action to be brought for a penalty created
by it, by any person who may sue for it, no person has such an interest
in it as can be the subject of arbitration, until an action has been
brought. Middleton v. Railroad, 95-167.
Any person may sue for the penalty imposed upon sheriffs by 1*2079
of The Code, for a false return, and he need not mention in his com

Ilarrell v. Warren, 100-259.
The penalty prescribed by The Code, \ i960, against corporations for

his own name against the purchaser for the amount bid upon tendering
a deed for the land sold. McKee v. Lineberger, 69-217.
Relators are parties to the action. —Relators in actions upon official bonds
are the real plaintiffs, and miscalling them will not impair their rijjlit to
recover when it is patent from the pleadings that they have a good
cause of action. Warrenton v. Arrington, 101-109.

friend of an infant is not, properly speaking, a party to the action,

v. Jones, 97-121.
Where a tenant in common disposes of his interest in the common
property, pending litigation in regard to it, his heirs are not necessary
parties to such litigation. Dawkins v. Dawkins, 93-283.
One tenant in common of chattels cannot maintain trover against his
co-tenant upon a mere demand and refusal to deliver to him his share of
the common property, but the act of withholding must be tortious, hav
ing the effect, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, of an actual destruc
tion of the property. Sheann v. Riggsbee, 97-216
If one tenant in common sue his co-tenant for possession, the action
will be dismissed, if it is shown that plaintiff's rights were not deuied,
and he had given no reasonable notice to his co-tenant of his demand to
be admitted to joint possession ; but where the defendant in such an
action, by his answer, denies the plaintiff's title, he thereby admits an
ouster, and the action lies. Allen v. Sallinger, 103-14.
One tenant in common is allowed to sue alone and recover the entire
interest in the property against another claiming adversely to his co-ten
ants as well as to himself, iu order to protect their rights against tres
passers and disseisors. Gilchrist v. Middleton, 107-663.
While a tenant in common of a chattel cannot maintain an action
against his co-tenant for conversion upon the ground merely that his
demand for possession has been refused ; yet, if the tenant in possession
withholds the common property, or exercises such dominion over it as
amounts to a denial, or is inconsistent with the rights of his co-tenant,
an action in the nature of trover will lie. Waller v. Bowling, 108-289.
Suits on notes executed to a special administrator or receiver. —A general
administrator, succeeding a special administrator or a receiver, may sue
in his own name on notes given to the special administrator. Cowles
v. Hayes, 71-230.

dian, is turned over to the ward in settlement, the latter can maintain
an action on it, though the legal title may have been transferred by the
guardian's endorsement to another. Usry v. Suit, 91-406.
Action upon a note for purchase-money of land. —An action upon a note
executed to a deceased person during his life-time for land sold by him
should be brought in the name of his personal representative. Blankenship v. Hunt, 76-377.
Heirs at law of mortgagee. —Generally speaking, the heirs of a mortga
gee are necessary parties to proceedings to foreclose. Where the mort
gagee assigned his interest in the mortgaged property, became insolvent
and left the state, leaving in his heirs, who are non-residents, the dry
legal title, they are not necessary parties. Etheridge v. Vernoy, 71-184,
Change of ownership pendente lite. —If a change of ownership takes
place during suit, the new owner can file a supplemental complaint.

Gooch, 87-442.

estate can be prosecuted by the real owner, notwithstanding adverse
possession by a third person at the time of the conveyance, although
the action was begun before the statute permitting this to be done.
Buie v. Carver. 75-559; Justice v. Eddings, 757581.
It was a rule of the common law, which is in force in this state, that
a conveyance of land, held adversely to the grantor was void, as to the
person so holding adverse possession and those claiming under him,
but was valid and passes title as to all the rest of the world. This is
altered by The Code, & 177, to the extent of allowing the grantee to sue
in his own name, provided he, or any grantor, or any other person
through whom he may derive title, might maintain such action, not
withstanding such conveyance was void, by reason of such actual
adverse possession, when it was made. Johnson v. Prairie, 94-773 ;
Osborne v. Anderson, 89-261.
Action by equitable owner of real estate. —The owner of real estate can
recover it in an action of ejectment although the legal estate is in his
trustee. Murray v. Blackledge, 71-492 ; Farmer v. Daniel, S2-152 ; Conroy v. Cheshire, 88-375.
The equitable owner of land may maintain an action for its recovery
though the legal estate is in his trustee. Murray v. Ferris, 71-492.
A purchaser of an equity of redemption has a sufficient legal interest
in the land to enable him to recover possession thereof from the mort
gagor. Black v. Justice, 86-504 ; Davis v. Evans, 27-525.
The grantee in a deed conveying only a life-estate, though it was
intended to have been made in fee-simple, cannot, after the death of
the grantor, maintain an action for trespass, as the equitable owner in
possession. Henley v. Wilson, 77-216.
The owner of an equitable estate may bring an action in the nature of
ejectment, under the Code system of procedure. Taylor v. Eatman,
92-601.
One who has the right of possession of an equitable estate in land,
may maintain an action for the possession. Graves v. Trueblood, 96-495.
Plaintiff being owner of the equitable estate of the obligee in a bond
for title, and of a one-fourth share of the legal title, can recover posses
sion in an action of ejectment against persons claiming under such
obligee. Grubb v. Lookabill, 100-267.
Where one who has an equitable title, subsequently acquires the legal
title, so that they become united in the same person, the former is merged
in the latter. Peacock v. Stott, 101-149.
Substituted plaintiffs. —Where an amendment was allowed without objec
tion, by which new parties were made to the complaint, and subsequently
the names of the original parties were stricken from the record, but no
change was made in the allegations in the complaint, the action might
be prosecuted to judgment in the name of the new parties, as if they
had been original patties. Richards v. Smith, 98-509.
Corporation. —Individual stockholders, in their own name, are not the
proper parties to assert the rights of a corporation ; action should be
brought by and for the corporation itself. If its officers or other stock
holders fail to do their duty in that respect, the remedy is, as a general
rule, to be sought within the corporate organization. Moore v. Mining
Co., 104-534.
Insurance policy. —The Constitution, art. 10, sec. 7, clearly looks to the
provision for the wife and children, so that they may not be left desti
tute by the death of an insolvent husband and father, and it is personal
to them when they survive. Hooker v. Sugg, 102-115.
Petition to sell land to make assets. —A judgment was obtained and dock
eted against one W., who afterwards purchased a tract of land, and,
being at the time indebted beyond his ability to pay, executed a deed to
one C, and died. The assignee, for value of the judgment brought
action to declare void the conveyance, and to have the land sold in dis
charge thereof. The defendant demurred that only the administrator
of W. could maintain an action to sell W.'s land : Held, that the demur
rer must be sustained. Tuck v. Walker, 106-285.
An action to try the title to a public oSce. —An action to try the title to a
public office may be brought by the attorney general, either on his own
information or on the complaint of a private party. People v. Hilliard,
72-169 ; Saunders v. Gatling, 81-298 ; Browu v. Turner, 70-93. See $607]
post, and notes thereto.
Unless expressly prohibited. —A party has a right to sue in his own name
in all cases, unless expressly prohibited. Brown v. Turner, 70-93.
Bond to make title. —A bond to make title to land on the payment of the
purchase-money may be assigned, and an action for damages for non
performance brought by the assignee. Utley v. Foy, 70-303.
Purchaser from the attorney of administrator. —One purchasing a note,
given to one who died intestate in Virginia, from the attorney of his
administrator, obtains the legal title and may sue thereon. Riddick v.
Moore, 65-382.
Administrator of deceased guardian. —An administrator of a deceased
guardian cannot maintain an action on the bond of a clerk and master
for a fund due the ward. Davis v. Fox, 69-435.
Devisee. —A testator's will contained the following provision: "It is
my will, and I direct that my real estate and personal property be kept
together for the use and benefit of my four daughters (naming them)
as long as they or any two of them, will remain together," and three of
them (one having died), the year after testator's death, lived and raised
on the land devised, a bale of cotton, which the executor took and sold :
Held, that they were entitled to recover, and that a justice of the peace
had jurisdiction of the action. Stikeleather v. Stikeleather, 100-89.
Mortgage—action to recover surplus. —When the proceeds of real estate,
in proceedings to foreclose a mortgage given by a person since deceased,
is paid into the clerk's office by judicial order, and subsequently it is
directed that the surplus of the fund, after payment of mortgage debt,
be paid to the administrator of the mortgagor, as assets to pay debts,
non-compliance with such judgment is a breach of the bond and the
administrator is the proper party to maintain an action therefor. Sharpe
v. Connelly, 105-87.
Assignment "for collection."—The purchaser of a note not endorsed,
from one to whom the obligee had given it for the purpose of collection,
does not become the real party in interest. McMinu v. Freeman, 68-341.
A party to whom a note is assigned, merely for the purposes of collec
tion, can not bring suit in his own name upon it. Abranis v. Cureton,
74-523. .
...
When the plaintiff transfers the claim, upon which an action is subse
quently brought, to an attorney at law, for collection, with directions to
him to apply the proceeds to demands which he held for collection
against the plaintiff due other parties, the plaintiff cannot maintain an
action in his name to recover the sum alleged to be due upon the claim.
The effect of the transfer was to vest the ownership of the claim in the
attorney, as a "trustee of an express trust," and the action should have
been brought in his name alone, or, in conjunction with that of the
cestui que trust. Wynne v. Heck, 92-414.
Assignment of judgment. —The assignee of a judgment can maintain an
action on it in his own name. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
While judgments are not treated as contracts for all purposes, they
are so treated for the purpose of distinguishing them from causes of
action arising ex delicto, and are not embraced in J 177 of The Code, for
bidding the assignment of things in action not arising out of contract.
Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
Not assignable. —Any claim or demand can be transferred, and the
assignee maintain an action on it in his own name, except when it is to
recover damages for a personal injury, or for breach of promise of marriage, or when it is founded on a grant made void by statute, or when
the transfer is forbidden by statute, or when it would contravene public
policy. Petty v. Rousseau, 94-355Equitable owner of tills and bonds. —The equitable owner of bills, bonds
and promissory notes can maintain an .action on them in his own name,
so the assignee of an unendorsed bond or note may bring an action on it
in his own name. Kiff v. Weaver, 94-274.
Bills, bonds and promissory notes, and all other evidences of debts,
although payable to order and not endorsed, may be given as donaticmes
causa mortis and the donee may sue on them in his own name. Kiff v.
Weaver, 94-274.
Husband of a plaintiff in an action for breach of promise. —The husband of
a plaintiff in an action for breach of promise, married since suit com
menced, is not a necessary party thereto. Shuler v. Millsap, 71-297.
Negotiable paper endorsed before maturity. —A negotiable note endorsed
before maturity, is not subject to a set-off in favor of the maker of a
debt by the payee at the time of making the note. The presumption of
law is that the holder of such paper is the owner, that he took it for
value and before dishonor, and that an undated endorsement thereon
was made at the date of the note. Tredwell v. Blount, S6-33 ; Pugh v.
Grant, 86-39 '• Applegarth v. Tillery, 105-407.
The maker of a note was examined in a supplemental proceeding,
brought against the payee, and upon such examination admitted that he
owed the payee the amount of the note. An order was made that a part
of the money due on the note be paid to the plaintiffs in such proceed
ing, with which order the maker complied. At the time the proceedings
were commenced the payee in the note had already transferred it, bona
fide, and before maturity, to A, who was never made a party to the pro
ceeding : Held, that A could recover from the maker, in a separate
action, the full amount of the note, with interest and costs, as it was the
maker's folly to admit owing the note to the payee before ascertaining
whether the note had been negotiated ; and A not being a party, all that
was done in the supplemental proceeding was res inter alios as to him.
Rice v. Jones, 103-226.
The assignee, for value of a note before it is due, and without notice,
takes it, discharged of any equities of the maker, or anyone claiming
under him, against the payee. Lawrence v. Weeks, 107-119.
See \\ 179, 243 and 244, post, and cases there cited.
Holder ofunendorsed negotiable paper. —The real owner of a negotiable note
may sue upon it without endorsement. Andrews v. McDaniel, 6S-385.
The law presumes that the holder of negotiable paper is the owner
and took it for value and before dishonor, and that an undated endorse
ment of the same was made at the date of the note. Tredwell v. Blount,
86-33 ; Pugh v. Grant, 86-39.
The possession of an unendorsed negotiable note or bond raises a pre
sumption that the holder is the rightful owner thereof, and this presump
tion is not rebutted by a denial in the answer. Jackson v. Love, 82-405 ;
Kiff v. Weaver, 94-274.
The holder of a note without endorsement now sues on it in his own
name, and not, as formerly, in the name of the payee. Abrams v. Cureton, 74-523;
To give title to a note or bond, an endorsement or assignment is not
necessary. Thompson v. Onley, 96-9.
The bare possession of a bond or note, unendorsed, by a stranger,
does not raise a presumption that it is the property of the person having
possession. Thompson v. Onley, 96-9.
The delivery of unendorsed promissory notes passes an equitable title.
Carpenter v. Tucker, 98-316.
Assignee of non-negotiable paper. —The assignee of paper non-negotiable
can sue in his own name (Bank v. Bynum, 84-24), but he succeeds only
to the rights of the assignor, and is affected by all defences against him
at the date of the assignment, or which accrued before notice thereof
to the maker. Havens v. Potts, S6-31.
The holder of a bond which is not negotiable may sue upon it in his
own name. Sutton v. Owen, 65-123.
The assignee of a note not made payable to bearer or order, but to the
payee alone, can maintain an action on it, and this though there is no
written assignment. Wilcoxon v. Logan, 91-449.
The assignee of a promissory note or bill of exchange endorsed before
maturity, takes it free from all equities and defences it may be subject
to in the hands of the payee ; but the assignee of a non-negotiable
instrument, even before maturity, takes it subject to all equities or coun
terclaims existing between the original parties at the time of the assign
ment. Bonds or sealed notes, not being negotiable until after endorse
ment, are on the same footing with non-negotiable instruments and bills
of exchange and promissory notes, transferred after maturity. Spence
v. Tapscott, 93-246.
M. executed to "B., executor of R. B.," a bond for the payment of
money ; B. died and his administrator brought action for the recovery
of the amount due ; B. 's administrator cannot maintain the action, and
it should have been brought by the administrator de bonis non of R. B.
While the possession of a bond made payable to another party will
ordinarily raise a presumption, as against the obligor, that he who has
that possession is the rightful owner, and will enable him to maintain
an action thereon in his own name, yet where, upon the face of the
instrument, it appears that the person to whom it was given took it in
a fiduciary capacity, the possession by the personal representative raises
no presumption that his intestate had become the owner in his individ
ual capacity, and the burden is upon him to show affirmatively a
transfer of ownership. Ballinger v. Cureton, 104-474.
Where one partner, in discharge of his individual indebtedness, and
without the knowledge or consent of his copartner, transferred to W.,
by endorsement in the firm name, a note belonging to the firm and past
due, the partnership receiving no benefit, and being, at the time insol
vent, and the note was afterwards paid by the obligor to W. : Held, in
an action by the assignee of the firm againt W., to collect the amount
paid him, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. In such case, the
amount due being less than two hundred dollars, a justice of the
peace has jurisdiction of the action. Hartuess v. Wallace, 106-427.
Assignment without prejudice,—A defendant cannot set off against the
assignee of a note, assigned after maturity, the indebtedness of the
assignor to him at the date of the assignment. McConnaughey v.
Chambers, 64-284 ; Neal v. Lee, 64-67S.
The case of Neal v. Lea is expressly overruled and the contrary doc
trine clearly held in Harris v. Burwell, 65-584.
A note transferred after it is due, with or without endorsement, is sub
ject to any set-off which the maker had against any holder at the time
of his transfer or before notice thereof. Martin v. Richardson, 6S-255 ;
Whedbee v. Riddick, 79-521 ; Pugh v. Grant, 86-39.
In an action for damages for non-performance of a bond to make
title, a note given to one of the obligors to induce her to submit to a
private examination, cannot be used as a counterclaim. Utley v. Foy
70-303A note in renewal of a former note of the maker for money won at
cards, given to one who is endorsee of such former note for value and
without notice, is not affected by the gaming consideration. Calvert v.
Williams. 64-168 ; contra if the new note had been executed to the
original payee. Palmer v. Giles, 58-75.
The construction placed upon this section, by Harris v. Burwell,
65-584, and Martin v. Richardson, 68-255, is confined to the makers of
promissorv notes, and does not apply as between endorsers. Adrian v.
McCaskill', 103-182.
When a note is endorsed after maturity the endorsee takes it subject
to any set-off or counterclaim existing at that time. Lane v. Richard
son, 104-642.
Assignee of part of the demand.—Where the holder of a claim, secured
by a lien, prior to the commencement of the action assigns a portion of
.1 claim to another, such assignee is not a necessary party to the action.
Boyle v. Robbins, 71-130.
Sec. 178. Action b;/ and against a married woman. C. C.
P., *. 56.
When a married woman is a party, her husband must
be joined with her, except that,
(1) When the action concerns her separate property, she
may sue alone.
Where the action concerns her separate property,—A married woman may
sue aloue when the action concerns her separate property. McCormac
v. Wiggins, 84-278.
Husband neglecting to employ counsel. —Where the wife sued jointly with
her husband, accepts serv ice of the summons, relying on him to employ
counsel, which he fails to do, she can be relieved from a judgment
taken by default against her. Nicholson v. Cox, 83-48.
Counsel selected by the husband. —A judgment against a married woman,
appearing in the suit, brought against her jointly with her husband, by
counsel of her husband's selection, is binding on her, unless it is
obtained by the fraudulent combination of the husband with the adverse
btigant. Vick v. Pope, 81-22.
Power of attorney to dismiss an action. —A power of attorney, given by
a married woman to dismiss an action concerning her land, need not be
registered. Hollingsworth v. Harman, 83-153.
Personal representative of husband a necessary party. —In an action to
foreclose a mortgage upon the separate estate of the wife, made to
secure a debt of the husband, his personal representative (he being
dead) is a necessary party. Mebane v. Mebane, 80-34.
Wife not a necessary party. —The wife is not a necessary party in an
actiou brought by her husband as tenant by the courtesy initiate to
recover her land. Wilson v. Arentz, 70-670.
Where the feme covert is a defendant. —A decree for the sale of land is not
conclusive upon a fane covert defendant whose husband is not served
with process nor otherwise made a party, nor leave obtained from the
court to proceed without him. Gully v. Macy, 81-356.
The defence of coverture must be made in apt time in order to be
available. Neville v. Pope, 95-346.
An action to recover possession of land may be sustained against a
married woman alone, whose husband is an alien, resides abroad, or has
abandoned his wife. Finley v. Saunders, 98-462.
Tenant by the courtesy —A tenant by the courtesy initiate has an interest
in the land, and is a necessary party to an action concerning it, and if he
refuses to be a co-plaintiff with his wife in such action, he should be
made a defendant. Where the action concerns the wife's separate prop
erty, or is between herself and him, she may sue alone. McGleunary v.
Miller, 90-215.
Action against husband and wife for wife's land. —Where husband and wife
are jointly sued for the wife's land, the plaintiff is not eutitled to a judg
ment for the husband's interest upon his failure to answer. Walton v.
Parish, 95-259.
Divorce a mensa et thoro. —A divorce a mensa et thoro does not change
the property rights of either the husband or wife. Castlebury v. Mayuard, 95-281.
Action for breach of promise. —The husband of a plaintiff married after
suit brought is not a necessary party in an action for breach of promise
of marriage. Shuler v. Millsap, 71-297.
The right to sue alone does not remove the protection of coverture as regards
the statute of limitations. —The right to sue alone is a privilege which may
be used to the advantage of a feme covert, but cannot operate to her
prejudice, and does not remove the disability of coverture so as to allow
the statute of limitation to bar her right of action. Lippard v. Troutmau,
72_55T ! Br>ggs v. Smith, 83-306 ; Campbell v. Carter, 95-150.
Jurisdiction. —A proceeding under the statute (The Code, \ 1790) to estab
lish a claim against a feme covert, and to have a lieu declared for mate
rials furnished, and work and labor done, in erecting a house on her
land, must be brought before a justice of the peace, if the amount
claimed is under two hundred dollars. Where the proceeding is not
under the statute, but a civil action, to coerce payment out of the sepa
rate estate of a feme covert, for her contracts, the superior court alone
has jurisdiction, although the amount be less than two hundred dollars.
Smaw v. Cohen, 95-85.
Justices of the peace have no jurisdiction to enforce contracts of a
married woman, unless she is a free trader, whether she has separate
property which she has charged or not. Doroughty v. Sprinkle, 88-300 ;
Berry v. Henderson, 102-525.
Ante-nuptial debts of a married woman up to two hundred dollars can
be recovered by action against her before a justice of the peace. The
Code, \ 1823 ; Hodges v. Hill, 105-130.
Service of summons. —In all actions whose object is to bind real estate
belonging to the wife, service of the summons must be made personally
upon her as well as upon her husband. Rowland v. Perry, 64-578.
(2) When the action is between herself and her husband
she may sue or be sued alone ;
And in no case need she prosecute or defend by a guard
ian or next friend.
Suit between wife and husband. —A married woman may sue her husband
or be sued by him alone. McCormac v. Wiggins, 84-278 ; Manning v.
Manning, 79-293.
Where B., the husband, conveyed a tract of land to S., in trust "to
allow the said B. and M. his wife to have the rents, etc., for their own
use; and further, that out of said rents, etc., to support the said M. in
such manner as she has heretofore lived," the wife could, in her name
alone, maintain an action against the trustee and the husband to compel
a performance of the trust, especially as it was evident the husband
refused to be associated with her, and it was probable the plaintiff might
be entitled to some relief against.him. Barnes v. Barnes, 104-613.
Sec. 179. Action by executor, trustee, die. C. C. P., s. ,17.
An executor or administrator, a trustee of an express
trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, may sue
without joining with him the person for whose benefit the
actiou is prosecuted. ' A trustee of an express trust, within
the meaning of this section, shall be construed to include a
person with whom, or in whose name, a contract is made
for the benefit of another.
Guardian. —A guardian may sue for the benefit of his wards without
joining the wards as parties. Rankin v. Allison, 64-673.
Survivor of joint guardians. —A survivor of joint guardians may sue on a
note pavable to both. Biggs v. Williams, 66-427 ; Mebane v. Mebane,
66-334Administrator of guardian,—The administrator of a deceased guardian
cannot maintain a suit on the bond of a clerk and master for a sum due
the ward of such deceased guardian. Davis v. Fox, 69-435 ; Alexander
v. Wriston, 81-191.
Trustees. —A trustee may sue upon a bond, given to his cestui que trust,
in his own name. Davidson v. Elms, 67-228.
Where a judgment recovered against a guardian has been assigned to
a person who paid the amount of it with the money of one of the sure
ties, the plaintiff in such judgment, and not the assignee of it, is the
trustee of an express trust, who can sue, as relator in an action upon the
guardian bond. Jones v. McKinnon, 87-294.
An assignment of a note for the purpose of collection merely does not
constitute the assignee a trustee of an express trust. Abrams v. Cureton,
74-523.
The possession and working of a mill after its transfer to a trustee is
prima facie evidence of a personal interest in its operations, entitling the
party to an action for damages against one impeding its work, through
the trustee must sue for damages affecting the land as an inheritance.
8alisbury v. Railroad, 91-490.
Beceiver. —A receiver appointed by the United States Court is not a
"trustee of an express trust" within the meaning of this section, nor
one "expressly authorized by statute," so as to enable him to sue in
behalf of the corporation placed in his hands for settlement. Battle v.
Davis. 66-252.
A receiver may bring an action without leave of court. Weill v.
Bank, 106-1 ; Gray v. Lewis, 94-392.

Administrator.— In an action by an administrator against the bond of a
previous administrator, the next of kin of the intestate need not be
joined. Flack v. Dawson, 69-42. See also cases cited under \ 177,
ante.
Sec. ISO. Infants to sue by guardian or next friend. C. C.
P., s. 58. 1870-'71, c. 233, s. 1. 1871-'73, c. 95. s. 1.
In actions and special proceedings whenever any of the
parties plaintiff are infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non
compos mentis, whether said infants, idiots, lunatics or per
sons non compos mentis be residents or non-residents of this
state, said infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non compos
mentis shall appear by their general or testamentary guar
dian, if they have any within the state, and if there shall
be no such guardian, then said infants, idiots, lunatics or
persons non compos mentis may appear by their next friend.
Persons having an adverse interest eannot act as next friend or gnardian. —
No one who has an interest in the action hostile to that of the infants
will be permitted to conduct the same. George v. High, 85-113.
Foreign gnardian. —A guardian appointed in another state has no au
thority to represent his wards in suits and proceedings in this state, but
when he brings suit for them as guardian it will be treated as if he were
next friend. Tate v. Molt, 96-19.
Infants bonnd by judgment. — Infants may sue and be sued, and are as
much bound by the judgment as persons sui juris, but infants must sue
by next friend or guardian, and defend actions against them by a regular
guardian, or, if they have none in this state, by a guardian ad litem.
Ward v. Lowndes, 96-367.
Where an infant sues by a next friend, he is as much bound by the
judgment as an adult, and this rule applies to non-resident as much as
to resident infants. Tate v. Mott, 96-19.
It is not essential that the infant should know that an action has been
brought in his favor by a next friend, as his incapacity to judge for him
self is presumed, but the court may inquire into the propriety of the
action and take such steps as may be necessary. Tate v. Mott, 96-19.
Where the lands of infants are sold under an order of the superior
court upon an ex parte petition, in which the infants are represented by
next friend, it is presumed that the court protected their interests, and
was careful to see that they suffered no prejudice. Tyson v. Belcher,
102-1 12.
Next friend removable. —The court has power, for good cause shown, to
remove the next friend of an infant litigant, and appoint another as often
as may be necessary. Tate v. Mott, 96-19.
Appointment not impeachable collaterally. —The presence of a next friend
or guardian ad litem to represent an infant, and his recognition by the
court, precludes inquiry as to his authority to act in a collateral pro
ceeding. Sumner v. Sessoms, 94-371.
Non compos mentis. —Persons non compos mentis may sue by their
next friend when they have no general or testamentary guardian. Smith
v. Smith, 106-498.
Guardian or next friend not party to snit. —One who conducts a suit as
guardian or next friend of infants is not a party of record nor estopped
by it. The infants themselves are the real plaintiffs. George v. High,
85-113 ; Branch v. Goddin, 60-497 ; Mason v. McConnick, 75-263 ; Smith
v. Smith 108-365.

C. P., s. 50. 1870-'71, c 233, s. 5. 1871-'2, c. 05, 8. 2.
In all actions and special proceedings, whenever any of
the defendants are infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non
compos mends, said infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non
compos mentis shall defend by their general or testamentary
guardian, if they have any within this state, whether said
infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non compos mentis are
residents or non-iesidents of this state ; and if. said infants,
idiots, lunatics or persons non compos mentis have no gen
eral or testamentary guardian within this state, and any of
the defendants in said action or special proceeding shall
have been summoned, then it shall be lawful for the court,
wherein said action or special proceeding is pending, upon
motion of any of the parties to the said action or special
proceeding, to appoint some discreet person to act as
guardian ad litem to defend in behalf of such infants,
idiots, lunatics or persons non compos mentis, and such
guardian so appointed shall, if the cause in which he is
appointed be a civil action, file his answer to the complaint
within the time required for other defendants, unless such
time be extended by the court for good cause ; and if the
cause in which he is so appointed be a special proceeding, a
copy of the complaint, with the summons, shall be served
on said guardian ad litem, and after twenty days' notice of
said summons and complaint in such special proceeding,
and after answer filed as above prescribed in such civil
action, the court may proceed in the cause to final judg
ment and decree therein in the same manner as if there
had been personal service upon the said infant, idiot, luna
tic or person non compos mentis, defendants, and any decree

lunatic or person non compos mentis, defendants, as effect
ually as if he or they had been personally summoned.
General guardian. —Service of process against infants should be made
on their general guardian, if they have one. Chambers v. Penland,
78-53Plaintiff not bound to move for appointment of guardian ad litem. —A plain
tiff is not bound to move for the appointment of a guardian ad litem
of an infant defendant, and his failure to do so is not such a laches as
will work a discontinuance.* Turner v. Douglas, 72-127,
Guardian ad litem cannot be appointed until the summons is served upon the
infant defendants. —A guardian ad litem cannot be appointed until the sum
mons is properly served and the other requirements of this section com
plied with. Hyman v. Jarnigan, 65-96.

of a summons upon him, qtiatre. Allen v. Shields, 72-504.
The section permits the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a
defendant who is an infant or non compos, only after service on the
infant, etc. Moore v. Gidney, 75-34 ; Nicholson v. Cox, 83-44.
A decree is not conclusive upon infant defendants who are not served
with process, and where the guardian ad litem was nominated by the
plaintiff, and filed an answer prepared for him at the plaintiff 's instance,
without inquiry into the rights of the infant defendants, the decree will
be set aside. Gulley v. Macey, 81-356.
A judgment obtained before the C. C. P. will not be vacated because
some of a number of infant defendants, united in interest, appeared by
a guardian ad litem appointed without process previously served on
such infants. As to actions brought since C. C. P., a previous service
of process is required before the court can appoint a guardian ad litem.
Matthews v. Joyce, 85-258; Fry v. Currie, 91-436.
Where, under the former system, a petition to sell land for assets was
filed in a court having jurisdiction of the proceeding, and a guardian
ad litem was appointed, but no service was made on the infants, even
if the judgment was irregular, it was not void and could not be attacked
collaterally. Hare v. Holloman, 94-14.
Where the" record shows that a guardian ad litem was appointed, but
it does not appear affirmatively that the infant was ever served, the
defect must be taken advantage of in a direct proceeding to attack the
judgment, and is not available in a collateral action. Sumner v. Sessoras, 94-371.
Before the adoption of the new system of procedure, it was the com
mon practice for the administrator to file his petition to sell land for assets, and if the heir was an infant, to have a guardian ad litem
appointed without any service upon the infant at all. Cates v. Pickett,
97-21.

of process. Bass v. Bass, 78-374 ; Nicholson v. Cox, 83-44.
Where the guardian ad litem does not accept. —If the guardian ad litem
who is appointed does not accept and defend as the law prescribes, the
judgment is void as to the infants. Isler v. Murphy, 71-436.
Guardian ad litem not taxable with costs. —Guardians ad litem are not
parties to the action, and can only be taxed with costs when the court
adjudges that there was bad faith or mismanagement, or that they offi
ciously procured themselves to be appointed to bring an unnecessary
action. Smith v. Smith, 108-365.
Proceedings apparently regular. — Where it appears in the record that all
the defendants were served, and it does "not appear that any of them
were infants, the judgment is, on its face, regular, and if any of the
defendants wish to set up infancy, it must be done by motion in the
cause to set the judgment aside for irregularity. Burgess v. Kirby, 94-575.
Guardian ad litem appointed only upon an application in writing. —The
court should see that the next friend or guardian ad litem is appointed
upon due consideration of an application hi writing, and not upon a
simple suggestion. Morris v. Gentry, 89-248.
The provisions of the statute in regard to the appointment of guar
dians ad litem should be strictly observed, but mere irregularities in
observing them, not affecting a substantial right, will not vitiate judg
ments and decrees obtained in the action or proceeding in which such
irregularities exist. White v. Morris, 107-92 ; Ward v. Lowndes, 96-367.
Irregular.—Regularly the guardian ad litem should be served with
summons and a copy of complaint, and should file answer for infant
defendant. If this is not done, there is irregularity. Coffin v. Cook,
106-376; White v. Morris, 107-92.
Note.—See Rule 17, of rules prescribed by the supreme court for the
superior courts, post.
Sec. 182. Guardian ad litem to file answer. 1S70-'71, c.

shall file an answer in said action or special proceeding,
admitting or denying the allegations thereof ; the costs and
expenses of which said answer, in all applications to sell or

the proceeds of the property, or in case of a division, shall
be charged upon the land, if the sale or division shall be
ordered by the court, and if not ordered in any other man
ner the court shall direct.
Answer. —The guardian ad litem should file an answer for the infant
defendants. Moore v. Gidney, 75-34.
If the guardian ad litem files, without inquiry into the rights of the
infant defendants, an answer prepared for him at the plaintiff's instance,
the judgment will not conclude the infant defendants. Gulley v. Macey,
8i -356.
No answer filed. —Where the record shows that a guardian ad litem was
appointed in 1866, but no answer was filed for the infants, and no effort
made to assert their rights, but the infants delayed action until the
youngest of them was twenty-four years old : // was held, that'the cause
would not be opened to allow them to assert their rights, when it had
proceeded to an end and all that was necessary was a final decree. Wil
liams v. Williams, 94-732.

party to ihe action is made plaintiff or defendant. Teague v. Downs,
69-280.

the possession of evidences of debt, accompanied by verifying affidavits,
makes a prima facie case justifying an order of admission. Long v.
Bank, 85-354.
Where in a creditors' bill a party's claim is disputed, he must ge1s
standing in court by establishing his own claim before he can dispute
that of another. Moore v. Edwards, 92-43.
Where an action is brought by one creditor, in behalf of himself and
all other creditors, every creditor has an inchoate interest in the suit,
and is, in an essential sense, a party to the action. If a creditor insti
tutes an independent action to recover his demand, he may be enjoined
and forced to seek his remedy in the creditor's bill, and if he declines to
do so he is bound by the decree in such action. Dobson v. Simonton,
93-268.
An action may be brought by a single creditor, or as many as he may
choose to unite with him, and is in the nature of a judgment creditor's
bill, and the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action acquire a preference

v. Smith, 81-285.
In an action to recover land, a third party, claiming to be joint owner

Subsequent mortgagee.—The plaintiff furnished to defendant materials
for fitting a steamboat, and they were used for this purpose, and shortly
thereafter, in the same year, duly filed notice of lien ; in an action to

still less where the court was ready to proceed to judgment when the
motion was made. Kornegay v. Steamboat Co., 107-115.
Wife of mortgagor. —The wife of a mortgagor has no such interest in
the lauds mortgaged as to make her a necessary party to proceedings to

Note. —This seems to apply only where the mortgage is for the pur
chase-money of the laud mortgaged, or where the marriage was prior

in which it may become necessary to sell them, and distribute the pro
ceeds of sale. Pitt v. Moore, 99-85.
Heirs of trustee.—Where land is given to a trustee to hold on various
trusts, and after the death of the trustee an action is brought to construe

or the court may, upon proper cause shown by the assignee or trustee,
at his instance, require their presence, but in no case will the death of
all or any of the cestuis que trust be a legal cause of continuance, unless

is of opinion that the ends of justice will be better subserved by the
presence of the representatives. Hancock v. Wooten, 107-9.

up the affairs of a partnership and make a distribution of its assets that

administration bond, it is not error in the court to refuse to make an
order to join the other sureties. Brown v. McKee, 108-387.
Administrator de bonis non.—Though an administrator d. b. n. is the
proper party to bring suit to collect assets to pay the debts of the estate,
his refusal to do so, without indemnity, makes it competent for the
creditors to sue, making him a party defendant, either under this sec
tion or the former equity practice. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
Injunction.—A public ministerial officer—here a sheriff—should not be
made a party to an action for an injunction to restrain the enforcement
of a judgment of a court or the performance of any act as public agent,

essary parties to an action to subject the real property of the firm to the
claims of its creditors. McCaskill v. Lancashire, 83-393.

administrator for a settlement, it is not ground for demurrer that the
defendant's wife, who is one of the next of kin, is made co-defendant
with him without alleging in the complaint that she had refused to join
as plaintiff. McCormack v. Wiggins, 84-278.
A wife and husband need not be put on opposite sides of a case
because their interests are antagonistic. Teague v. Downs, 69-288.

mon is a necessary party to a proceeding for partition of the land held

sets up an equitable defence, all persons interested in that equity are
necessary parties. Ten Broeck v. Orchard, 74-409.
One claiming title paramount and adverse to both plaintiff and
defendant, in an action to recover real property, has no right to be made a party. He must be connected in interest with either one or the other.
Colgrove v. Koonce, 76-363.
Pending an action to recover land, B., the plaintiff, died, leaving a
will, wherein he provided that his wife should have the use of specific
personal property and the rents and profits of his real estate, to be paid
to her by the executor for her life, or widowhood, the executor to "have
charge of the renting and letting of the same," and after the death or
marriage of the wife, the executor was directed to "sell off all my
property, real and personal, and reduce my property of every kind, to
cash :'* Held, that the executor was properly made party to the action
because the terms of the will vested in him the right to possession, and
further, if that was not so, he was entitled to the damages which might
be recovered up to the death of the testator for withholding the land.
McAlpine v. McDaniel, 101-550.
Where parties in interest are very numerous.—Where it is alleged that the
parties are so numerous that it is impracticable to bring them all
before the court, one may sue or be sued for all the others. Bronsou v.
Insurance Co., 85-411 ; McMillan v. Reeves, 102-550.
Where the parties in interest are very numerous, and it is impracti
cable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend
for the benefit of all, but how far those not actually before the court
may be affected by the judgment, is left open. Thames v. Jones, 97-121.
Proceedings to vacate
creditor of a corporation
may come in as a party to a proceeding by the attorney general to
vacate the charter. State v. Simonton, 7S-57.
Heirs of a testator.—Nor are the heirs of a testator, under a will devis
ing the land to be sold and converted into money, necessary parties in
a proceeding to sell the land. Harris v. Bryant, 83-568.

joinder of parties applies to all actions, legal as well as equitable, under

immaterial, except as to costs. Rowland v. Gardner, 69-53 ; Falls v.
Gamble, 66-455 I Burnes v. Ashworth, 72-496.

ment may be rendered for those who are entitled to it. Warrenton v.

The introduction of unnecessary parties into an action will not defeat
the right of those entitled to recover. McAlpine v. Daniel, 101-550.

tion of payment by either plaintiff would be with the assent of the
other. "Perkins v. Berry, 103-131.
Additional parties,—Additional parties, if application is made by them,
can be joined by amendment. Isler v. Koonce, 83-55.

probable that the proposed parties are in some way necessary to a
proper and complete determination of the action. Lee v. Eure, 92-283.

done, when taking the answer as true such party would have no ground
on which to resist the plaintiff's claim. Morehead v. Railroad, 98-362.

ment with full knowledge of all the facts; that it received all the prop
erty and effects and assumed all the liabilities of the assignor ; that the
stockholders in both corporations were identical, and the assignor was a
non-resident, and had, in fact, ceased to exercise its corporate functions:
Held, that the assignor was not a necessary party. Silver Valley Mining
Co. v. Baltimore Smelting Co., 99-445.
Party of record—.Where it appears from the record that a person was a
party to an action, when in fact he was not, the legal presumption that
he was a party is conclusive, until removed by a correction of the record
itself, by a direct proceeding for that purpose. Sumner v. Sessoms, 94371Heirs of obligor in a bond to make title.—In an action brought by the
personal representative of an obligor in a bond for title to subject the

Creditors.—The court cannot deprive plaintiffs in a creditor's bill of

advantage of it afterward. Lewis v. McNatt, 65-63.

See \ 187, re-enacting the provision of the Revised Code referred to.
Independent contracts not having the same parties.—A cause of action in
which several defendants are jointly liable cannot be united in the same
action with one in which only part of them are liable. Logan v. Wallis, 76-416.

ity was several. But now by The Code, all contracts are several in
legal effect, although joint in form. Rufty v. Claywell, 93-308.
Where four copartners joined in a note to purchase property for the
partnership account, and after the dissolution of the firm, the plaintiff

c. 1, s. 4. R. C, c. 46, s. 43.
(1) No action shall abate by the death, marriage or other
disability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest
therein, if the cause of action survive or continue. In case

merely vindictive, marriage or other disability of a party,
the court, on motion at any time within one year there
after, or afterwards on a supplemental complaint, may
allow the action to be continued by or against his repre
sentative or successor in interest. In case of any other
transfer of interest, the action shall be continued in the
name of the original party, or the court may allow the
person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in
the action.
Amendment, c. 389, Acts 1887—new parties to be made by
the clerk.
Whenever any party to an action now pending or here
after brought in the superior courts of this state shall die
pending the action, the death of such party may be sug

party or parties who succeed to the rights or liabilities of
the defendant or defendants commanding them to appear
before him on a^day to be named in said summons, which
shall be at least twenty days after the service thereof, and
answer the complaint, and the issue or issues joined by the
filing of the said answer shall stand for trial at the term of
the superior court next following. When the plaintiff or
plaintiffs- sljal]".die; aijd: the -suggestion 'of the* "death of a
party isf made, "it: shall .be tlie" duty of ffie* clerk-' before

ties or party succeeding to the rights of party deceased who
will be necessary to the prosecution of the action to final
judgment to appear and become party plaintiff ; and in
event the party made plaintiff shall file an amended com
plaint, then the defendant shall have twenty days after
notice of the amended complaint being filed in which to
file an answer thereto, and the issue thus made up shall
stand for trial at the succeeding term.

chargeable therewith. Miller v. Leach, 95-229.

against a tenant for life, the defendant dies, his personal representative
may be made a party. So much, however, of the action as is for puni

taking and conversion of personal property does not abate. Sledge v.
Reid, 73-440.

does not survive to the personal representative. Hannah v. Railroad
Co., 87-351.

interest in the subject-matter of the controversy, the cause may still
proceed in his name, or the assignee may be substituted in his place.

costs. Davis v. Higgins, 92-203.

cause of action survives, the suit can be abated only on motion of a
party, and whether it shall be then is a matter in the discretion of the
court. Moore v. Railroad Co., 74-528 ; Lord v. Beard, 79-5 ; Baggarlly
v. Calvert, 70-688.
(2) After a verdict shall be rendered in any action for a
wrong, such action shall not abate by the death of a party.
Death of a party after judgment. —When a party to an action dies after
judgment the action abates, just as it would by his death before judg
ment. Aycock v. Harrison, 71-432.
Where a judgment has been rendered against a surety to a bond, who
died after the judgment was entered, his administrator cannot set up as
a defence to a notice to show cause why judgment should not be entered
against him as administrator, and execution issue, that his intestate
was insane when he signed the bond. Such matter must be brought
forward by a direct proceeding to attack the judgment. Rollins v.
Love, 97-210.
Plea in abatement must be insisted on before verdict. —A party cannot have
the benefit of a plea in abatement by a motion in arrest of judgment.
The pendency of a former action is strictly a matter of abatement, and
must be set up in the answer or insisted upon before verdict, else it is
deemed waived. Hawkins v. Hughes, 87-115.

recovered a judgment against an administrator can revive the same, after
his death, against the administrator de bonis non. Thompson v. Badham, 70-141.
Assignee of dormant judgment. —Where the assignee of a judgment
which had become dormant, instituted in his own name, as assignee,
proceedings for leave to issue execution, to which the defendant was a
party but made no opposition, and the leave was granted, the defend
ant and those claiming under him were concluded by those proceedings
from denying the assignment. Windley v. Bonner, 99-54.
(3) At any time after the death, marriage or other disa
bility of the party plaintiff, the court in which an action
is pending, upon notice to such persons as it may direct,
and upon application of any person aggrieved, may, in its
discretion, order that the action be deemed abated, unless
the same be continued by the proper parties, within a time
to be fixed by the court, not less than six months, nor
exceeding one year, from the granting of the order.
Discretionary. —The law entrusts the power of abatement to the court
to prevent advantage being taken of the ignorance or poverty of the
parties. The court will accordingly so rule, in each case, as to time
and notice, as to promote the ends of justice. Baggarly v. Calvert,
70-688.
Sec. 189. Court may'' determine controversy and Inter
pleader. C. C. P., s. 65.
The court, either between the terms or at a regular term,
according to the nature of the controversy, may determine
any controversy before it, when it can be done without
prejudice to the rights of others or by saving their rights ;
but when a complete determination of the controversy
cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the
court must cause them to be brought in. And when in
an action for the recovery of real or personal property, a
person not a party to the action, but having an interest in
the subject-matter thereof, makes application to the court
to be made a party, it may order him to be brought in by
the proper amendment. A defendant against whom an
action is pending upon a contract or for specific real or
personal property, upon proof by affidavit that a person
not a party to the action makes a demand against him for
the same debt or property without collusion with him,
may, at any time before answer, apply to the court, upon
notice to that person and the adverse party, for an order to
substitute that person in his place, and to discharge him
from liability to either, on his paying into court the amount
of the debt, or delivering the possession of the property,
or its value, to such person as the court shall direct. The
court, in its discretion, may make such an order.
Application for dower. —Where a widow, as general devisee of her hus
band's estate, has conveyed a large portion of the land in trust to
secure her own debts, and then dissents from the will and asks for
dower, the trustee is not a necessary party to her petition. Ramsour v.
Ramsour, 63-231.
The court may permit a creditor of a person, who died seized and pos
sessed of lands, to be made a party to a proceeding for dower, and con
test the claim of the widow. Welfare v. Welfare, 108-272.
Action to recover real property.—Where both the plaintiff and a third
party claim to be the landlord of the defendant, such third person has a
right,^ upon affidavit, to be let in as a party defendant to an action to
recover such property. Rollins v. Rollins, 76-264.
If in such an action judgment is rendered against the tenant, no writ
of possession will issue till the controversy is also decided between the
plaintiff and the intervener. Rollins v. Henry, 76-269.
In a suit by a purchaser at an execution sale seeking to dispossess the
husband of the wife's land, the wife's possessory right is such an interest
in the controversy as entitles her to be made a party defendant. Cecil
v. Smith, 81-285 ; Young v. Greenlee, 82-346.
In an action for the recovery of real property, a person who claims
title, paramount and adverse, both to plaintiff and defendant, should not

76-363 ; McDonald v. Morris, 89-99. See \ 184, ante, and notes.

essary party to the action. Matthews v. McPherson, 65-189.
Where a wife asserts an independent title in herself, she has the right
to intervene and defend in an action of ejectment brought against her
husband. Taylor v. Apple, 90-343.
A claimant to land in dispute between other parties to a suit, who is
not connected with any interest in that controversy, but claims by a title
different from that of both claimants in the suit, cannot intervene and
become a party. A party may intervene when he has an interest in the controversy, but not when he has only an interest in the thing which is
the subject of the controversy. Asheville Division v. Aston, 92-588.
Fraudulent vendees. —In a proceeding under \\ 318, 324, C C P., to
subject the lands of a deceased debtor to sale to satisfy a judgment
lien thereon, the vendees in an alleged fraudulent conveyance made by
the judgment debtor before the attachment of the lien, are not neces
sary or proper parties ; and if they have been joined as defendants, the
plaintiff may be permitted at any time to enter a nonsuit, or not. pros.
as to them, notwithstanding they may have filed answers asserting coun
terclaims and asking for affirmative relief. These provisions of the C
C P. not being brought forward in The Code, all creditors are now
required to seek payment from the personal representative, who will
apply the assets according to the respective priorities of the demands.
Lee v. Eure, 93-5.
Purchaser under junior judgment. —// seems that a purchaser under a
junior judgment, who acquired his title after the action against L. and
wife was begun, will not be allowed to make himself a party defend
ant and assert his title in that cause. Mooring v. Little, 98-472.
Supplementary proceedings against corporation. —The owner of orders for

interplead in supplementary proceedings by a plaintiff judgment cred
itor who has obtained his judgment. Heggie v. B. & L. Association,

Petition for partition. —In proceedings for partition the personal repre
sentative of ancestor cannot be allowed to interplead and ask for license
to sell the land for assets. Garrison v. Cox, 99-478.
In a justice's court ; intervener. —The question of title, which arrests
further proceedings (in actions affecting real property) before a justice, is
between the parties to the action, and a jurisdiction once acquired can
not be divested by the intervention, in that court, of a stranger assert
ing a superior title in himself. Davis v. Davis, 83-71.
Defences of intervening landlord. —A landlord let in to defend an action
of ejectment is not restricted to the defences to which his tenant is con
fined. Isler v. Foy, 66-547 ; Maddrey v. Long, 86-383.
Bond by intervener. —A landlord may be joined with his tenant as defend
ant in an action against the former for possession of the land occupied

to the plaintiff for costs and damages, or make the affidavit and file the
certificate required to enable him to defend as a pauper. Harkey v.
Houston, 65-137.
Pleadings by intervener. —In an action by one creditor in behalf of all,
against an executor or administrator for an account, another creditor

Claim of intereste in attached property. —A third person claiming a mortgave upon the property attached, can come in and be made a party. An
issue would be made in the cause as to his claim. Bear v. Cohen, 65-51 1.

ants answer that other persons owned the land at the time of the lease

are necessary parties to the action. McKesson v. Mendenhall, 64-286.
Interpleader in quo warranto to vacate a charter. —The court has power to
allow a judgment creditor of a corporation to interplead in an action in
the nature of a qito warranto, brought by the attorney general, to vacate
the charter. State v. Simonton, 78-57.
Right to interplead lost by lapse of time.— In an action for the recovery
of personal property, a third party claiming the same loses his right to
be made a party to the suit by allowing three years to pass after notice
of the action, before moving to interplead. Clemmons v. Hampton,
78-534This section applies. —This section confers on the court the right to
determine the opposing claims of execution creditors to the fund under
its control, upon a motion in the cause in which the execution issued
which produced the fund. Dewey v. White, 65-225 ; Fox v. Kline, 85-173.

these persons to interplead. Dewey v. White, 65-225.
See, also, a general discussion, without particular adjudication, in

Leach v. Railroad, 65-486. See cases cited, \ 195, post.

either county had jurisdiction. Thames v. Jones, 97-121.
When chief object of action concerns real estate. —When an action relating
to real estate is brought in a county other than that in which the land
is situated, the judge must, upon proper application made in apt time,
direct its removal to the proper county. The fact that there are other
questions to be determined in the action, does not alter the case when
the chief purposes of the suit are to compel one defendant (trustee) to
sell and another defendant to convey, lands situated in a county other
than that in which the action is pending. Manufacturing Co. v. Brower,
105-440.
(2) For the partition of real property ;
(3) For the foreclosure of a mortgage of real property ;
Action by holder of notes given for purchase of land. —An action by the
holder of notes, given for the purchase of land, against the purchaser
and others, asking to be subrogated to the rights of the vendor in the

any cause.]

this subsection by chapter 219, Acts 1889.
The words "distrained for any cause," in this subsection do not apply
to the seizure by the sheriff in the provisional remedy by claim and
delivery ; and the situation of the property in such actions in which •
claim and delivery is resorted to, does not regulate the place of trial of
such actions. Smithdeal v. Wilkerson, 100-52.
This is now changed by statute chapter 219, Acts 1889, as before noted.

body of water, and opposite to the place where the offence

Co., 69-412; Steele v. Commissioners of Rutherford Co., 70-137.
Action against cities and towns. —Cities and towns must be sued in the
county in which they are located, and if smt is brought in another
county, they have the right to have it removed. Jones v. Statesville,
97-86.
Obligors in an indemuifying bond. —The obligors on a bond to indemnify
a sheriff against loss, etc., in seizing and selling property under execu
tion, are not included in that class of persons "who, by his command
or in his aid shall do anything touching the duties of such office," and
where an action was brought in the county of L, against such obligors
. residing in the county of B, as aiders and abettors of the sheriff of the
latter county in the unlawful seizure and conversion of goods under exe
cution, it was not error to refuse to remove the cause to the county of B
Tor trial. Harvey v. Brevard, 98-93.

of the defendants shall reside in the state, then in the county
in which the plaintiffs, or any of them, shall reside ; and if
none of the parties shall reside within the state, then the
same may be tried in any county which the plaintiff shall
designate in his summons and complaint, subject, however,
to the power of the court to change the place of trial, in
the cases provided by statute.
Parties of record. —The "parties" plaintiff and defendant in the con
templation of this section, are the parties of record, and no objection to
the venue can be taken by pleading that a party for whose benefit an
action is brought, lives in another county. Rankin v. Allison, 64-673.
Obligors on indemnifying bond. —An action brought in one county against
the sheriff of another, and also against other parties (who had executed

ants are not entitled to have the cause removed to the county of the
sheriff for trial. Harvey v. Rich, 98-95.

removed for trial from the state to the federal courts, under the acts of
congress, unless the latter has original jurisdiction of the action.
Foundry Co. v. Howland, 99-202.
When a proper case for removal is made out, no formal order to trans
fer the action is necessary—the state court will simply suspend further
proceedings unless the federal court should remand the cause. Foundry
Co. v. Howland, 99-202.
A non-resident defendant whose petition for removal of the cause to
the United States court was denied on the ground of insufficient affida

Motion in writing and before time for answering expires. —If the county des
ignated in the summons be not the proper county, still the trial may pro
ceed, unless the defendant, before the time of answering expires, demand
in writing that the cause be removed to the proper county. This applies
to actions for recovery of real estate, as well as personal actions. Lafoon
v. Shearin, 91-370.
In an action for damages for false imprisonment, brought in the county
of Rowan against certain public officers of the county of Anson, time
was granted to file answer, and before time expired defendants moved to
have the action removed to the latter county, on the grounds that defend
ants were public officers, acting in their official capacity ; that there were
a number of material witnesses who could not attend trial on account of
the distance and their poverty, and defendants were unable to pay their
expenses : Held, (1) that the defendants are entitled to the removal
allowed under this section, unless they have lost their rights by failure
to comply therewith ; (2) that the making of their motion for removal
before the expiration of the time allowed to file answer, and before
answer was filed, was in apt time ; (3) the defendants were allowed any
defences they might have had, had there been no extension of time; the
answer was filed after the motion and before the next (fall) term.
Quare : Whether defendants could not have had their demands passed
upon before the fall term, and whether or not it was the duty of the
court to find how the fact was and determine the question of removal
upon the uncontroverted affidavit of defendants. Shaver v. Huntley,
107-623.
The court may change the place of trial in the following
cases :
Mandatory. —Where an action is brought to the wrong county, and the
defendant demands, in writing, that the place of trial be changed, the
words "may change the place of trial," in this section, will be interpre
ted as meaning " must change," etc. Jones v. Statesville, 97-86.
The question of removal, when the action is not brought in the proper
county, is not one of discretion ; when the statute imposes a duty, " may "
means must. Manufacturing Co. v. Brower, 105-440.
(1) When the county designated for that purpose is not
the proper county;
Removal ex mero motu. —If the county is not the proper one, the judge

action against him to the county in which the bond is filed. Rankin v.
Allison, 64-673.

dismiss or to remove to the proper county. Stanly v. Mason, 69-1 ; Jones
v. Commissioners, 69-412.
A motion to dismiss an action brought in the wrong county may be
treated as a motion to remove. Cloman v. Staton, 78-235.
(2) When the convenience of witnesses and the ends of
justice would be promoted by the change ;
Criminal actions. —Under chapter 63, Laws 1885, and The Code, 196,
198, the criminal court of Mecklenburg has jurisdiction to try an indict
ment for murder removed into that court from au adjacent county. State
v. Weddington, 103-364.

county to another for trial. State v. Swepson, 81-371 ; State v. Hay
wood, 94-847.
Civil actions. —On the contrary, in a civil action by this section the
motion to remove must be made before answer filed. See cases supra.
Interlocutory motions and orders. —A judge of the superior court has no
jurisdiction to hear and determine actions or interlocutory motions and
orders therein without the county in which such actions may be pend
ing, unless by the consent of the parties thereto. Godwin v. Monds,
IOI-354(3) When the judge shall have been, at any time, inter
ested as party or counsel. When the place of trial is
changed, all other proceedings shall be had in the county
to which the place of trial is changed, unless otherwise
provided by the consent of the parties in writing duly filed,
or by order of court ; and the papers shall be filed or trans
ferred accordingly.
When the judge is a party to the suit. —When the summons has been
served and the complaint filed, the case is pending sufficiently to entitle
a party to remove it to an adjoining judicial district if the presiding
judge is a party to the suit. Carter v. Railroad, 68-346.
After order of removal, jurisdiction. —When the order of removal is made
the jurisdiction of the court making the order ceases, except that sub
poenas may issue from either court. Fisher v. Mining Co., 105-123.
Sec. 196. Judges authorized to remove causes from one
county to another. 1879, c. 45.
In all civil and criminal actions in the superior and crim
inal courts, in which it shall be suggested on oath, or by
affirmation, on behalf of the state, or the traverser of the
bill of indictment, or of the plaintiff or defendant, that
there are probable grounds to believe that justice cannot
be obtained in the county in which the action shall be
pending, the judge shall be authorized to order a copy of
the record of said action to be removed to some adjacent
county for trial, if he shall be satisfied that a fair trial can
not be had in said county, after hearing all the testimony
which may be offered on either side by affidavits.
Sufficient affidavit. —An affidavit by a party that he cannot have a fair
and impartial trial in the county, owing to the great prejudice against
him, and that the adverse party is of great influence in the county, which
he believes will be used to his prejudice, is sufficient to justify an order
removing the cause. Smith v. Greenlee, 14-387.
It is not necessary in an affidavit for removal that the belief of the
affiant should be stated. It is sufficient if it sets forth the facts 011 which
he grounds his belief. State v. Seaborn, 15-305, overruling State v.
Twitty, 9-248.
The leading purpose of The Code, \\ 196-197, is to secure a fair and
impartial trial ; the affidavit is required to make the facts appear to the
court. But if they are admitted, or agreed on by the parties, this is
sufficient, and it is not necessary that they should appear in the record
or order of removal. Emery v. Hardee, 94-787.
It is within the power of counsel to consent that the court might hear
and consider the facts as if stated in an affidavit. Ibid.
Removal discretionary with the judge. —In an application to remove or con
tinue a case, the discretion to do either rests with the judge of the supe
rior court and cannot be reviewed by the supreme court. State v. Dun
can, 28-98; State v. Hildreth, 31-429; State v. Hill, 72-345; State v.
Hall, 73-134 ; State v. Johnson, 104-780.
Orders in the cause. —Rules and orders made by consent, after an order
for the removal of a cause, but before it is removed, are not erroneous.
Smith v. Greenlee, 14-387.
See, also, Commissioners v. Lemly, 85-341.
Sufficiency of order of removal. —An order of removal directing that "the
trial shall be removed" is sufficient, without directing further that a
copy of the record of said cause be removed. State v. Shepherd, 30-195.
Order of removal conclusive. —The order of removal is conclusive, and
the court to which it is removed should proceed with the case, unless it
positively appears that the order was made contrary to law. Boyden v.
Williams, 84-608.
Appeal. —Where, upon a motion to remove a cause, no facts are stated
in the affidavit of the applicant as grounds for such removal, the ruling
of the court below may be reviewed, but where the facts are set forth,
their sufficiency rests in the discretion of the judge, and his decision
upon them is final. Philips v. Lentz, 83-240.
Sec. 197. What requisite to authorize such removal. 1879,
C. 45.
No action, whether civil or criminal, shall be so removed,
unless the affidavit shall set forth particularly and in detail
the ground of the application. And it shall be competent
for the other side to controvert the allegations of fact in
said application, and to offer counter affidavits to that end.
And the judge shall not order the removal of any such
action unless he shall be satisfied, after thorough examina
tion of the evidence as aforesaid, that the ends of justice
demand it.
Removal before issue joined. —Semite, that a cause cannot be removed
before issue joined. State v. Reid, 18-377. Decided as to State cases.
State v. Swepson, 81-571; 94-847. Exception to this rule where the pre
siding judge is a party. Carter v. Railroad, 68-346, and, indeed, in all
civil cases by \ 195.
See notes under preceding section. For decisions under previous stat
utes, see Battle's Revisal, vol. 2, p. 989.
Sec. 198. On removal of an action, what to be sent with
transcript. B. V.,c.31,s. 118. 1806, c. 694, s. 12. 1810,
c. 787.
When a cause shall be directed to be removed, the clerk
shall transmit to the court to which the same is removed a
transcript of the record of the case, with the prosecution
bond, bail bond, and the depositions, and all other written
evidences filed therein.
Contradictory transcripts. —Where, upon the removal of a cause, two
contradictory transcripts of the record are certified, the contradiction
can be reconciled by an inspection of the original record. But where
they are not contradictory, they form but one copy, and both may be
used by the court. State v. Collins, 14-117.
Proper verification of transcript. —The court to which a cause is removed
is the sole judge whether the transcript is properly verified, and all other
courts are bound by its decisions. State v. Duncan, 28-236; State v.
Lambert, 93-618.
Insertion of affidavit for removal. —The affidavit for the removal of a cause
ought no more to be inserted as a part of the record than one for a con
tinuance. State v. Barfield, 30-344.
Orders in the cause pending removal. —Until the transcript is deposited,
the removal is not complete, and, subsequent to the order, and until such
deposit of the transcript, the clerk of either court may issue subpoenas
and commissions to take depositions. Commissioners v. Lemly, 85-341.
See, also, Smith v. Greenlee, 14-387.
Amending the transcript. —The court from which a cause has been re
moved can supply an omission in the record by making an amendment
and sending a copy of the amended record to the court to -which it has
been removed. State v. Reid, 18-377.
Defect in transcript of record. —Where there is a defect in the transcript
of the record, the proper course is to move, in the county where the
record was made, to amend it, and have the amended record brought to
the county where it stands for trial by a certiorari. State v. Swepson,
81-571.
Where the clerk sends a defective transcript on the removal of a cause,
it is not a compliance with the order, and he may, of his own motion,
send another. State v. Anderson, 92-732.
Court to which removal is ordered. —Where there is an order for the
removal of an action which is sufficient on its face, it will be conclu
sively presumed that the court making the order had before it, in a legal
way, facts sufficient to warrant the order. The court to which the action
is removed can consider only the sufficiency of the order, and not of the
facts on which it is based. Emery v. Hardee, 94-787.
In the superior court of Union it was ordered that this case be removed
to the criminal court of Mecklenburg for trial, and that the clerk of
Union superior court certify the record to the superior court of Mecklen
burg, " to the end that it may be there docketed and from there certified
to the criminal court," etc., for trial. A certified copy of the record was
sent to the superior court of Mecklenburg, the clerk docketed it and
then transmitted the same certified copy to the clerk of the criminal
court, attaching to it a certificate that it had been forwarded to him from
the clerk of Union: Held, that the record being duly certified, it was
not material through how many hands it passed in transitu, and the
criminal court had jurisdiction to try the case. So much of the order
of removal as required the docketing of the case in the superior court
of Mecklenburg was surplusage. State v. Weddington, 103-364.
Court from which removed. —When an action is ordered removed to
another county, it is error in the judge presiding in the superior court of
the county from which the cause is removed, at the next term thereof,
and before the term of the court in the county to which it was removed,
to direct that the action be dismissed if the costs of the transcript be not
paid in a time specified. The party procuring the order of removal has
until the term of the court to which the cause is removed to deposit his
transcript. Fisher v. Mining Co., 105-123.
What should he sent. —Besides the transcript of the record proper, the
prosecution bond, bail bond, depositions and other written evidence filed
therewith should be transmitted. Clark v. Peebles, 100-348.
Sec. 199. Civil actions commenced by summons. C. C. P.,
s. 70.
Civil actions shall be commenced by issuing a summons.
No summons necessary. —No summons need issue in cases coming under
\\ 567 and 570, post. Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243.
Defect in name of defendant.—A defect in the name of the defendant is
cured by a judgment of default rendered against him. Clawson v.
Wolf, 77-100.
Service of summons notice of action. —The service of summons is notice
of an action, and the defendant is bound to take notice of all subsequent
proceedings therein. Sparrow v. Davidson College, 77-35 ; University
v. Lassiter, 83-38.
Action begun by summons. —An order, granting an injunction and direct
ing summons to issue, is irregular, since the order cannot be applied for
until the action is instituted by the issue of a summons. Patrick v. Joyner, 63-573 ; McArthur v. McEachin, 64-72.
Irregularity of not issuing summons waived. —The court will not notice
such irregularity, however, unless objection is made by the defendant
before answering. Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612 ; Moore v. Railroad, 67-209 ;
Middleton v. Duffy, 73-72. Contra, Etheridge v. Woodley, 83-11.
Special proceedings. —Proceedings for dower, partition and year's allow
ance, and any other proceedings that under the old system could be
commenced by petition, or by motion upon notice, are special proceed
ings and not civil actions. Tate v. Powe, 64-644. See \\ 126 and 127, ante.
Action to recover land. —An action to recover land is a civil action, and
the summons is returnable to term. Woodley v. Gilliam, 64-649.
Removal or substitution of trustee. —Semble, that a proceeding to remove
or substitute a trustee is a civil action, though in jurisdiction of the pro
bate court. Guion v. Melvin, 69-242.
Enforcement of equitable right. —The enforcement of an equitable right,
as that of subrogation, can only be maintained by a civil action. All
civil actions must be commenced by summons. Calvert v. Peebles,
82-334The proper method of enforcing judgments nisi is by an action or by
a special proceeding commenced by summons. Thompson v. Berry,
64-79 ; Jones v. Gupton, 65-48. (This is changed by statute. See \ 446,
post).
Summons before a justice should contain. —In actions in the courts of jus
tices of the peace, it is essential that the summons shall contain a state
ment of the sum or the value of the property sought to be recovered,
and a defect in this particular will not be cured by the insertion of the
necessary averment in the pleadings or other process. Without such
averment in the summons, the court acquires no jurisdiction, and any
judgment rendered thereon is void, and may be collaterally attacked for
that reason. Leathers v. Jackson, 101-184.
Action begun, when. —The action is begun when the summons is issued
as original process. Fleming v. Patterson, 99-404.
Sec. 200. Summons in action returnable to a regular term
of the superior court. J876-'7, c. 83, 8. 1.
The summons shall run in the name of the state, be
signed by the clerk of the superior court having jurisdic
tion to try the action, and shall be directed to the sheriff or
other proper officer of the county in which the defendant,
or one or more of the defendants, resides or may be found.
It shall be returnable to the regular term of the superior
court oi the county where the plaintiff, or one or more of
them, or the defendant, or one or more of them, resides,
and from which it issued ; and shall command the sheriff,
or other proper officer, to' summon the defendant, or defend
ants, to appear at the next ensuing term of the superior
court and answer the complaint of the plaintiff, and shall
be dated on the day of its issue. The officer to whom the
summons is addressed shall note on it the day of its delivery
to him, and shall execute it at least ten days before the
beginning of the term to which it shall be returnable, and
shall return it on the first day of the term.
Officer to note date of receipt of summons. —The requirement that the
officer shall note thereon the date of its delivery to him does not apply
to final process. Wyche v. Newsom, 87-144.
Fees must be paid or tendered. —A sheriff is not compelled to execute a
summons until his fees are paid, but he is required to make relurn of all
process coming into his hands, and is liable for any failure to do so.
Jones v. Gupton, 65-48 ; Johnson v. Kennedy, 70-435.
Amendment of summons. —Where the summons was made returnable
before the clerk, it is competent for the court to amend it after service by
making it returnable to the term. Thomas v. Womack, 64-657 ; Cheat
ham v. Crews, 81-343.
A summons or other process can be amended, in the discretion of the
courts, if the defect issucb as would be waived by a general appearance,
and the rights of third persons are not affected thereby. Jackson v.
McLean, 90-64; Henderson v. Graham, 84-496.
"Noting" delivery. —The failure of the sheriff to note on the summons
the day it was received is irregular, but does not render the summons
void. Strayhorn v. Blalock, 92-293.
Return.—The term "return " means that the process must be brought
back and produced in the court whence it issued with such endorse
ments as the law requires. Watsou v. Mitchell, 108-364.
Summons for a corporation.—In a summons against A. H. B., " President
of Southern Improvement Company," these latter words are mere
descriptio persona, and do not make the company a party to the pro
ceeding. Plemmons v. Improvement Co., 108-614.
Ten days, how computed. —In computing the ten days before the begin
ning of term required for the service of the summons, it is a rule settled
by long practice, to include the day of service and exclude the return
day, or e converso. Taylor v. Harris, 82-25.
Act suspending original C. C. P. —The " act suspending the Code of Civil
Procedure in certain cases," is not unconstitutional in requiring writs
in civil cases to be "returned to the regular term of the superior court,"
etc., instead of the clerk's office. McAdoo v. Benbow, 63-461.
Civil actions must (by the act of 1868-'9, chapter 76) be issued by the
clerk, and made returnable in term time. McArthur v. McEachin,
64-72.
Under the "act suspending the Code of Civil Procedure in certain
cases," the summons in a civil action is to be returned to the term : There
fore, an action in which the summons was returnable before the clerk,
upon demurrer by the defendant, will be dismissed; and a provisional
warrant of attachment, (issued because defendant was removing his
goods, etc.), although properly returnable, will follow the fate of the
action. Jones v. McClair, 64-125.
Summons issued after the passage of this act, returnable before the
clerk, is not void but irregular, and may be set aside on motion. Woody
v. Jordan, 69-189.
Construed. —The summons must be issued by the clerk and made
returnable in term time. McArthur v. McEachin, 64-72.
Summons issued by clerk of one superior court returnable to superior court of
another county. —The clerk of the superior court of one county has no
right to issue a summons returnable to the superior court of another
county ; but irregularity of service is waived by an appearance and
answer in bar. Moore v. R. R. Co., 67-209; Howerton v. Tate, 66-431.
Clerks can issue for or against themselves.—It has been the practice in this
state for clerks to issue process either for or against themselves. Evans
v. Etheridge, 96-42.
Not irregular. —Summons " to appear before the judge of the superior
court at the court to be held for the county of Buncombe, at the court
house in Asheville, on the third Monday after the
Monday of
November," it being the only court for that part of the year, is not
irregular. Roberts v. Alman, 106-391.
Too late to object. —After a party has pleaded it is too late to take any
objection to the process by which he was brought into court. Butts v.
Screws, 95-215. See § 214, post, and cases cited.
When summons not necessary. —Sections 315 and 325 of the C C P. (^567
and 570, post) are still in force, notwithstanding the Act of 1868 -'9,
ch. 76, suspending the Code in certain cases, and controversies may still
be submitted without action, and judgment confessed according to
them. Hervcy v. Edmunds, 68-243.
Sec. 201. Summons returnable. 1870-'7, c. 75, s. 2.

days of the beginning of the next term of the superior
court for the county in which it is issued, it shall be made
returnable to the second term of said court next after the
date of its issuing, and shall be executed and returned by
the proper officer accordingly.
Prior to the adoption of this section. —Where a summons was issued
within ten days before the term of the superior court to which it was
returnable : Held, that the action should have been dismissed on the
motion of the defendant, and that it was error to order an alias return
able to the next ensuing term. Folk v. Howard, 72-527.
Sec. 202. When the summons is issued more than ten days
before the next succeeding term. 1870-'7, c. 85, s. 3.
When the summons shall be issued more than ten days
before the next succeeding term of the superior court of
the county to which it is returnable, and shall be executed
by the proper officer within less than ten days of said term,
it shall be returned as if executed in proper time, and the
case placed on the summons docket and continued to the
next succeeding term, at which term it shall be treated in
all respects as if said next succeeding term had been the
return term thereof : Provided, . that the parties to the
action may, by agreement, make up the pleadings at the
term to which the summons is returnable : Provided
further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed
to release or discharge the sheriff or other officer from
any liability he may incur by failing to execute the sum
mons in due time.
Coroner's deputy. —Process issued to a coroner under this section can be
served by deputy. Yeargin v. Siler, 83-348.
Sec. 203. Summons to be attested. 1870-'7, c. 85, s. 4.
Every summons addressed to the sheriff or other officer
of any county, other than that from which it issued, shall
be attested by the seal of the court ; but when it shall be
addressed to the sheriff or other officer of the county in
which it issued it shall not be attested by the seal of the
court.
Summons issued to another county. —When the writ issues to another
county, it is void without the seal, and confers no power upon the
sheriff of such county to act. Taylor v. Taylor, 83-116 ; Folk v. How
ard, 72-527.
Sec. 204. Summons in the same action may issue to several
counties at the same time. R. C, c. 3 1, s. 44. 1789, c. .314,

the sheriff of any county where a defendant is most likely
to be found, noting on each summons that it is issued in
the same action ; and when the said writs are returned they
shall be docketed as if only one had issued, and if any
defendants shall not be served with such process the same
proceeding shall be had as in other cases of similar process
not executed.
Sec. 205. Sheriff returning that defendant is not to be
found, plaintiff may issue alias or pluries summons. It.
C, c. 31, s. 52. 1777, c. 115, ss. 23, 71.
When the sheriff shall return in a civil action or special
proceeding that the defendant is not to be found in his
county, the plaintiff may sue out an alias or pluries sum
mons, returnable in the same manner as original process.
Discontinuance. —A discontinuance results from the voluntary act of the
plaintiff in not regularly issuing the successive connecting processes
necessary. Penniman v. Daniel, 93-332.
Sec. 200. Filing of complaint. 180S-'!),c.70,s.3. 1S70-'1,
c. 42, s. 1.
The plaintiff shall file his complaint in the clerk's office
on or before the third day of the term to which the action
is brought, otherwise the suit may, on motion, be dismissed
at the cost of the plaintiff.
Time of filing complaint extended. —The courts have an inherent discre
tionary power to amend pleadings or to allow them to be filed at any
time, unless prohibited by statute, or unless vested rights are interfered
with. Gilchrist v. Kitchen, 86-20 ; Brendle v. Heron, 68-496.
Semble, that when permission is given the lasf. day of the term to file
an amended complaint, a motion to strike out the judgment, taken for
want of an answer at that term, should be granted. Ellington v. Wicker,
87-14.
Entry of "time to file pleadings."—An entry of time to demur or answer
does not extend the time to the trial term. Boddie v. Woodard, 83-2.
Complaint filed after judge has left. —A pleading placed on the files of the
court after the judge has left for the term, is not filed in contemplation
of law. Foley v. Blank, 92-476.
Complaint filed after return term.—Where complaint is filed after the
return term, it stands on file during the first three days of the next suc
ceeding term, and judgment by default for want of answer at that term
may be rendered. Roberts v. Alman, 106-391.
Dismissal of complaint. —It is error to dismiss a complaint because the
defendants are summoned to answer A and B, and the complaint is in the
name of A, B and others. Wilson v. Moore, 82-558.
Nonsuit taken by plaintiffs,—Entry of nonsuit, and "judgment against
plaintiffs for costs " is not a relraxit. Wharton v. Currituck, 82-1 1.
A plaintiff who has gotten possession of property under claim and
delivery, cannot take a nonsuit and cut off the defendant's pleas. Manix
v. Howard, 82-125.
When a counterclaim is set up by the defendant, the plaintiff cannot
take a nonsuit. Purnell v. Vaughan, 80-46.
This provision does not prevent the plaintiff from taking a nonsuit at
his own election wherever only a judgment for costs can be rendered
against him ; when the answer would justify an affirmative relief to the
defendant he cannot.
Defendant's motion to nonsuit tie plaintiff. —A motion for nonsuit cannot
be made a substitute for demurrer. If a complaint does not show a cause
of action the defendant should demur. He has only a right to move for
nonsuit under the provisions of this section. Andrews v. Pritchett,
66-387.
Sec. 207. Answer of defendant. 1870-'1, c. 42, s. 4.
The defendant shall appear and demur, or answer, at the
same term to which the summons shall be returnable, other
wise the plaintiff may have judgment by default.
Refusal to allow answer to be filed at trial term. —The refusal of the judge
to allow an answer to be filed at the trial term is a matter of discretion
and not reviewable. Reese v. Jones, 84-597 ; Boddie v. Woodard, 83-2.
Sham answer. —A sham answer is false in fact. An irrelevant or frivo
lous one has no substantial relation to the controversy, and presents no
defence to the action, though its contents may be true. When such are
filed they may be stricken out and the plaintiff have judgment by default.
Howell v. Ferguson, 87-113. See \ 247, post.
Sec. 208. Reply to answer, issue to stand for trial. 1870-'1,
c, 42, s. 5.
The plaintiff shall join issue on the demurrer or reply to
the answer at the same term to which such demurrer or
answer may be filed ; and the issues, whether of law or of
fact, shall stand for trial at the next term succeeding the
term at which the pleadings are completed.
Time to plead —An entry on docket " complaint filed, time to demur or
answer, ".does not extend the time for pleading to the trial term, and the
refusal of the presiding judge, in his discretion, to allow pleadings to be
filed at that term, is not appealable. Boddie v. Woodard, 83-2.
Trial of issues postponed by consent. —Parties may, by consent, postpone
a trial of issues of law, to vacation. Harrell v. Peebles, 79-26.
Sec. 209. Before issuing the summons clerk to take under
taking, etc. B. ft, c. 31, s. 40. C. C. P., s. 71. 18fi8-'9,
c. 277, s. 13.
Before issuing the summons, the clerk shall require of
the plaintiff, either to give an undertaking with sufficient
surety in the sum of two hundred dollars, with the condi-
tio'n that the same shall be void if the plaintiff shall pay
the defendant all such costs as the defendant shall recover
of him in the action ; or to deposit a like sum with him as
a security to the defendant for such costs ; and in case of such
deposit he shall give to the plaintiff and to the defendant
a certificate to that effect ; or to file with him a written
authority from some judge or clerk of a superior court,
authorizing the plaintiff to sue as a pauper.
Surety on prosecution bond. —A surety on a prosecution bond is not liable
to his principal for costs, nor to anyone for any part of the plaintiff's
costs. Hallman v. Dellinger, 84-1 ; Swain v. McCullock, 75-495.
Sufficient undertaking. —Where an undertaking under seal to secure the
defendant's costs, was written on the back of the summons, but did not
specify the name of either the plaintiff or defendant, or the surety, it
was held to be sufficient. The seal is surplusage. Holly v. Perry, 94-30.
Too late to object. —An objection that one who has been permitted to
become a party plaintiff upon filing a prosecution bond, has not com
plied with the condition, comes too late after the amendment has been
made and supplemental complaint filed. The execution of such bond is
an incidental, and not an essential, condition of the order. Hughes v.
Hodges, 94-56.
Judgment for costs on failure to file undertaking. —Where a portion of the
plaintiffs have been compelled to withdraw from the action upon their
refusal to file a prosecution bond, it is not erroneous to enter judgment
against them for costs. Lafoon v. Shearin, 95-391.
Duty of clerk. —Where a summons which is to be personally served, is
ordered to be issued by the court, it is not the duty of the clerk to issue
it until it is demanded by the plaintiff; but when service is ordered to be
made bypublication, after the expenses are paid by the plaintiff, it is the
duty of the clerk to obey the order, and make the publication. Penniman v. Daniel, 93-332.
Fees of officers payable in advance. —Officers of the courts are not com
pelled to perform their duties, unless the fees prescribed by law are paid
or tendered them, but they must demand them before laches can be im
puted to litigants. West v. Reynolds, 94-333.
A lien exists in favor of the officers of the court when they do not
require the plaintiff, as they have a right to do, to pay their fees in
advance. In such instances the officers (sheriff and clerk of the court)
have the right of retainer, to the extent of the costs, out of the amount
collected, and neither can be compelled to look exclusively to the plain
tiff's prosecution bond, nor prevented from exhausting their remedy
against the debtor, by reason of any receipt or compromise between the
judgment creditor and debtor. Long v. Walker, 105-90 ; Clerk's Office
v. Bank, 66-214.
Actions in the nature of a bill of review. —This section applies to actions
in the nature of a bill of review. Matthews v. Joyce, 85-258.
Former practice as to dismissing for want of a prosecution bond. —After the
plaintiff has been allowed to go on and prepare his case for trial, the court will not, on motion by defendant, dismiss peremptorily for want
of a prosecution bond, but will permit the plaintiff then to prepare and
file such a bond. Brittain v. Howell, 19-107 ; Russell v. Saunders, 48432.
Sec. 210. Leave to sue as a pauper, how obtained. C. C. P.,
a. 72. 1868-'9, c. 96, s. 1.
Any judge or clerk of the superior court may authorize
any person to sue as a pauper in their respective courts,
when he shall prove, by one or more witnesses, that he has
a good cause of action, and shall make affidavit that he is
unable to comply with the last section.
Notice. —Notice of application to adverse party is not required. Deal
v. Palmer, 68-215.
Non-resident. —A non-resident may sue as a pauper in the courts of this
state. Porter v. Jones, 68-320.
Affidavit of applicant competent. —The applicant may prove his cause of
action by his own oath. Sumner v. Candler, 74-265.
Affidavit need not negative. —In an application to prosecute an action in
forma pauperis, it is not necessary the affidavit should state that the
applicant did not own real estate which he might mortgage to secure
costs. Maggett v. Roberts, 108-174.
Certificate of counsel. —The certificate of counsel is sufficient proof of "a
good cause of action.'" Miazza v. Calloway, 74-31.
Either the judge or clerk may grant leave. —Either the judge or the clerk
of a superior court may grant leave to sue as a pauper therein; the clerk
may grant such leave in the probate court, and a justice of the peace in
his own court. Rowark v. Gaston, 67-291.
Assignment of cause of action pendente lite. —If suit is brought in forma
pauperis, and the plaintiff assigns his interest in the subject-matter of
the action, the court, upon notice of that fact, will dismiss the action
unless security is given for costs. Davis v. Higgins, 91-382.
Guardian can sue in forma pauperis. —An adult or infant, suing by his
guardian, can obtain leave to sue in forma pauperis by complying with
the provisions of this section. Brendle v. Heron, 68-496.
Objections to affidavit waived. —Where suit is brought in forma pauperis,
and the answer is filed and the case continued on docket from term to
term for three years, the action cannot be dismissed for insufficiency of
the affidavit, without notice of the defendant's motion given to the
plaintiff. Semble, that the objection has been waived by the defendant.
Corn v. Stepp, 84-599.
See. 211. Court may assign counsel. 1868-'9, c. 96, s. 2.
The court to which such summons is made returnable
may, at its discretion, assign to the person suing as a pau
per, learned counsel, who shall prosecute his action.
Sec. 212. No costs or fees recoverable. 1868-'9, c. 96, s. 3.
Whenever any person shall sue as a pauper, no officer
shall require of hiin any fee, and he shall recover no costs.
If successful, recovers no costs. —Wherever one sues in forma pauperis,
no officer shall require of him any fees, and, if successful in his suit, he
shall recover no costs. Booshee v. Surles, 85-90; Hall v. Younts, 87-285.
One suing in forma pauperis is not entitled to recover the costs of his
witnesses. Draper v. Buxton, 90-182.
Witnesses .summoned by the pauper must be paid by him.—Witnesses sum
moned by one suing in forma pauperis are entitled to their costs for
attendance. Officers of the court only are included in the order author
ized by the act. Morris v. Rippy, 49-533; Bailey v. Brown, 105-127.
Sec. 213. What summons to contain. C. C. P., s. 74.
1876-'7, c. 241, s. 1.
There shall be inserted in the summons a notice, in sub
stance, as follows: That if the defendant shall fail to answer
the complaint within the time specified, the plaintiff will
apply to the court for the relief demanded in the complaint
Amendment of summons. —Process may be amended in many cases, but
not where third persons have acquired rights which may be prejudiced
thereby. Bank of Cape Fear v. Williamson, 24-147; Smith v. Low,
24-457; Phillips v. Holland, 78-31.
Irregular process may be amended, but is no protection to the plaintiff
or officer for acts done under it before amendment. Woody v. Jordan,
69-189.
Summons irregular but not void—Summons returnable at a day specified,
before the clerk, since the act of l868-'69, ch. 76, is not void, but merely
irregular. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189.
Sec. 214. Service of summons. 1870-'7, c. 241, s. 2.
The summons shall be served in all cases, except as
hereinafter provided, by the sheriff or other officer reading
the same to the party or parties named as defendants, and
such reading shall- be a legal and sufficient service.
Appearance in the action. —An appearance in an action dispenses with
necessity of process. Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21 ; State v. Jones, 88-683 ;
Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612 ; Moore v. Railroad 67-209 ; Middleton v. Duffy,
73-72 ; Penniman v. Daniel, 95-341. Contra, Etheridge v. Woodley,
83-11.
An irregularity in serving a summons is waived by the defendant's
answering, though he is an infant. Turner v. Douglas, 72-127.
An appearance by counsel, even without authority, is regular upon its
face, and will usually bind the party for whom the appearance was made.
England v. Garner, 90-197.
Where a party assumed the defence of an action as administrator, the
regularity of his admission as a party in place of his intestate is sufficiently shown by the record, though the death of intestate was not sug
gested and no notice issued to the administrator to be made a party.
Alexander v. Patton, 90-557.
An objection that an action is prematurely brought, is waived by
answering to the merits. Clements v. Rogers, 91-63.
A general appearance, even before the referee, cures all antecedent
irregularity, Roberts v. Alman, 106-391.
Return " served," prima facie sufficient. —The return by the sheriff of pro
cess " served," is prima facie sufficient, and implies that he has served
it as the statute directs until the contrary is made to appear. If the ser
vice is insufficient the plaintiff is entitled to an alias, and it is error to
dismiss the action. Strayhorn v. Blalock, 92-293.
Return by deputy sheriff. —Whether the return of process by a deputy
sheriff in his own name is sufficient, quare. Brickhouse v. Sutton,
99-103.
Service of process on Sunday.—The service of any process on Sunday is
unlawful. Devries v. Summit, 86-126.
Possibly, service of summons on Sunday is not invalid. Every act
may be lawfully done on Sunday which may be lawfully done on any
other day, if there is no statute forbidding it. An appearance waives all
irregularities of service. White v. Morris, 107-92 ; Turner v. Douglas,
72-127.
Employment of counsel by one not a party.—One interested in the result
of the suit, who employs counsel' to attend to it, is not thereby made a
party of record, nor does a published notice requiring him to plead have
that effect. Davis v. Higgins, 91-382.
Service by attachment. —When the summons is served by an attachment
on property (of a non-resident), the lien so acquired is prior to a subse
quent levy by one who has already obtained judgment. McMillan v.
Parsons, 52-163.
But the requirements (in such case) of 55349 and 356, post, must be
complied with. Deaver v. Keith, 61-428.
Summons not served. —Process not served is exhausted on the day fixed
for its return, and the action in law is then discontinued, unless an alias
is then ordered. Webster v. Laws, 86-178; Fulbright v. Tritt, 19-497;
Governor v. Welch, 25-249; Hanna v. Ingram, 53-55; Etheridge v. Woodley, 83-11.
Acceptance of service. —The acceptance of service by a party is equiva
lent to a service of summons upon him. Johnston v. Futrell, 86-122;
Stancill v. Gay, 92-455.
The time and place of acceptance need not be endorsed on a summons
returnable to the term. Nicholson v. Cox, 83-44.
Special appearance. —Where it is desired to take advantage of any defect
in the service of process, a special appearance should be entered for that
purpose. Penniman v. Damel, 95-341.
A special appearance of the defendant's counsel does not bring it into
court for the purposes of the action. Plemmons v. Improvement Co.,
108-614.
No service nor appearance, judgment void. —Decrees are absolutely void
against heirs, whether infants or adults, not served in some sufficient
way. Harrison v. Harrison, 106-282.
Acceptance of service by a married woman. —A married woman can accept
service of summons. Nicholson v. Cox, 83-44.
Acceptance of service by infant. —An infant cannot accept service. Bass
v. Bass, 78-374.
Defective service by publication. —Semble, that a defective service by pub
lication may be remedied by an order for re-publication. Price v. Cox,
83-261.
Sec. 215. Actions against executors and administrators.
1876->7, c. 241, s. 6.
In addition to the remedy by special proceeding, as pro
vided by law, actions against executors, administrators,
collectors and guardians may be brought originally to the
superior court at term-time; and in all such cases it shall
be competent to the court in which said actions shall be
pending to order an account to be taken by such person
or persons as said court may designate, and to adjudge the
application or distribution of the fund ascertained, or to
grant other relief, as the nature of the case may require.
Concurrent jurisdiction.—The superior courts have concurrent jurisdic
tion with the probate court of actions to compel an administrator to
account, and of other actions of like nature. Haywood v. Haywood,
79-42 ; Bratton v. Davidson, 79-423 ; Pegram v. Armstrong, 82-326.
Sec. 216. Notice of no personal claim. C. C. P-, s. 81.
In case of a defendant, against whom no personal claim
is made, the plaintiff may deliver to such defendant, with
the summons, a notice, subscribed by the plaintiff or his
attorney, setting forth the general object of the action, a
brief description of the property affected by it, if it affects
real or personal property, and that no personal claim is
made against such defendant. If a defendant on whom
such notice is served unreasonably defends the action, he
shall pay costs to the plaintiff.
Sec. 217. Manner of service of summons. C. C. P., s. 82.
1874-'5, c. 168, s. 1.
The summons shall be served by delivering a copy
thereof in the following cases :
(1) If the action be against a corporation, to the presi
dent or other head of the corporation, secretary, cashier,
treasurer, director, managing or local agent thereof: Provided, that any person receiving or collecting money
within this state for, or on behalf of, any corporation of
this or any other state or government, shall be deemed a
local agent for the purpose of this section ; but such service
can be made in respect to a foreign corporation only when
it has property within this state, or the cause of action
arose therein, or when the plaintiff resides in the state, or
when such service can be made within the state personally
upon the president, treasurer or secretary thereof ;
Service on local agent of corporation. —The summons in an action against
a foreign corporation may be served either upon a local or general
agent. Jones v. Insurance Co., 88-499; Katzenstein v. Railroad Co.,
78-286.
As to former law, see Cunningham v. So. Express Co., 67-425.
Quaere, as to whether, under the charter of the N. C R. R. Co., service
upon one of its local agents would be sufficient. Wagoner v. N. C R. R.
Co., 50-367.
A local agent of a foreign corporation, upon whom process can be
served so as to bring the corporation into court, means an agent resid
ing either permanently or temporarily in this state for the purpose of
his agency, and does not include a mere transient agent. Moore v.
Bank, 92-590.
Attorney not a local agent. —An attorney for a foreign corporation, who
has claims to collect for them in this state, is not a local agent upon
whom process can be served. Moore v. Bank, 92-590.
Summons must be against corporation, not its officers or agents.—A suit
against a corporation (here a town) must be brought in its corporate
name, and not against its officers or agents. Young v. Barden, 90-424.
Applicable to criminal as well as civil actions. —This subsection is applica
ble to criminal as well as civil actions. State v. Railroad, 89-584.
Copy of summons.—Summons in civil actions before a magistrate does
not require to be executed by leaving a copy with the defendant. Kirkland v. Hogan, 65-144.
Note. —A copy need not now be left with any defendant save in the
cases recited in this section.
(2) If against a minor under the age of fourteen years,
to such minor personally, and also to his father, mother or
guardian, or if there be none within the state, then to any
person having the care and control of such minor, or with
whom he shall reside, or in whose service he shall be.
employed ;
Service on guardian. —The general guardian of infant defendants is the
proper person upon whom service of process against such infant should
be made. Chambers v. Penland, 78-53.
Service on infant. —The summons must be served on the infant person
ally when he has no general or testamentary guardian, and a guardian
ad litem appointed, upon whom the summons will then be served.
Moore v. Gidney, 75-34 ; Allen v. Shields, 72-504.
Where there is no general guardian, the service of summons on the
infant must be personal. Turner v. Douglas, 72-127 ; Coffin v. Cook,
joo-376.
Jurisdiction cannot be acquired over infant defendants, except by ser
vice of process upon them. Young v. Young, 91-359.
Courts obtain jurisdiction over infant defendants over fourteen years
old exactly in the same manner in which they do over adults, but if the
infant is under fourteen, besides serving them personally, and leaving a
copy with them, a copy of the summons must also be delivered to the
father, mother or guardian, or if there is none in this state, then to the
person who has the care and control of the infant, and in the case of
non-resident infants by publication, as in other cases. Ward v. Lowndes,
96-367. But defective service is cured by '$ 387, post. White v. Morris,
107-92.
The appointment of a guardian ad litem is valid, although the infant
has not been regularly served with process, but has only accepted ser
vice thereof. Cates v. Pickett, 97-21.
Service on guardian ad litem. —The summons must be served on guar
dian ad litem. Gulley v. Macey, 81-356 ; Moore v. Gidney, 75-34.
(3) If against a person judicially declared to be of
unsound mind, or incapable of conducting his own affairs
in consequence of habitual drunkenness, and for whom a
committee or guardian has been appointed, to such com
mittee, and to the defendant personally : Provided, that if
the superintendent of an insane asylum, or the acting super
intendent of such asylum, shall inform the sheriff or other
officer who is charged with the duty of serving a summons
or other judicial process, or notice, on any insane person
confined in such asylum, that the summons, or process, or
notice, cannot be served without danger of injury to such
insane person, it shall be sufficient for such officer to return
said summons, process, or notice without actual service on
the insane person, but with an endorsement that it was
not personally served because of such information ; and
when an insane person shall be confined in a common jail,
it shall be sufficient for an officer charged with service of
a notice, summons or other judicial process, to return the

CLARK'S CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
same with the endorsement that it was not served because
of similar information as to the danger of service on such
insane person, given by the physician of the county in
which said jail is situated.
Note.—The proviso in this subsection was added by acts 1889, c. 89.
Service upon a lunatic. —Where the action is against a lunatic, the sum
mons should be served both upon the lunatic and also upon his guardian.
Should such guardian fail to defend the action, semble, that a guardian
ad litem may be appointed. McAden v. Hooker, 73-24.
■Sec. 218. Service by publication. C. C. JP., s. 83. 1885,
c. 380. 1889, c. 108 and 263. 1891, c. 120.
Where the person on whom the service of the summons
is to be made, cannot, after due diligence, be found within
the state, and that fact appears by affidavit to the satisfac
tion of the court or to a judge thereof, and it in like man
ner appears that a cause of action exists against the defend
ant in respect to whom service is to be made, or that he is
a proper party to an action relating to real property in this
state, such court or judge may grant an order that the ser
vice be made by publication of a notice in either of the fol
lowing cases :
(1) Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, and
has property within the state, or the cause of action arose
therein ;
Affidavit. —Everything necessary to dispense with personal service of
the summons must appear by affidavit. Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21 ; Faulk
v. Smith, 84-501.
// seems, that the affidavit to obtain an order for the publication of a
summons, may be made after the order, provided the order remains in
abeyance until the affidavit is filed. Bank v. Blossom, 92-695.
Affidavit by agent.—The affidavit can be made by an agent or attorney.
Weaver v. Roberts, 84-493.
Amendment of affidavit.—The court can permit an amendment of the
printer's affidavit, to show when the publication began. Weaver v.
Roberts, 84-493.
If affidavit for publication is deficient, it is error to dismiss. An amend
ment should be allowed. Branch v. Frank, 81-180.
Semble, that a defective service by publication can be remedied by an
order for re-publication. Price v. Cox, 83-261.
(2) Where tne defendant, being a resident of this state,
has departed therefrom, with intent to defraud his credit
ors, or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself
concealed therein with a like intent;
(3) Where he is not a resident of this state, but has
property therein, and the court has jurisdiction of the sub
ject of the action;
Insufficient affidavits. —An affidavit which states that the defendant is a
"non-resident of this state," but does not state that he " has property
within the same," is not sufficient to justify a service by publication.
Spiers v. Halstead, 71-209; Windley v. Bradway, 77-333.
The requirements of the statute must be strictly complied with, and an
affidavit is fatally defective which does not state that the person on whom
the summons is to be served cannot, after due diligence, be found in the
state. Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21.
Service upon partners by publication. —Service of summons by publication
upon two copartners, who are non-residents, will not sustain a judgment
against a third partner who is a resident of the state. Pender v. Griffin,
72-270.
Chose in action is "property."— A chose in action is property, and em
braced in the terms of this section, providing for service by publication,
" when the defendant is not a resident of this state, but has property
therein," etc. Winfree v. Bagley, 102-515.
(4) Where the subject of the action is real or personal
property in this state, and the defendant has, or claims, a
lien or interest, actual or contingent, therein, or the relief
demanded consists wholly or partly in excluding the defend
ant from any lien or interest therein;
Proper party to action affecting realty.—Service by publication is only
authorized when it appears that a cause of action exists against such
defendant, or that he is a proper party to an action relating to real prop
erty in this state. Claflin v. Harrison, 108-157.
(5) Where the action is for divorce, and in all cases
where publication is made, the complaint must be filed
before the expiration of the time of publication ordered;
Divorce. —In divorce, if it appear by affidavit that the defendant is a
non-resident, the summons can be served by publication. King v. King,
84-32.
(6) Where the stockholders of any corporation are deemed
to be necessary parties to an action, and their names or
residence are unknown ; or where the names or residence
of parties interested in real estate the subject of an action
are unknown, the court having jurisdiction may, upon affi
davit, that after due diligence, the names and residence of
such parties cannot be ascertained, authorize service by
publication in one or more newspapers, at the court's dis
cretion, of any summons, notice or order deemed necessary
in the premises, with a brief recital of the subject-matter
of the suit, and such publication shall be deemed sufficient
summons or notice to all parties warned in such publica
tion, or interested in the subject-matter, whether residing
in this state or so named or not : Provided, that the name
of at least one of the parties to the action and interested in
the subject-matter thereof shall be known and he be a
resident of the state. Ch. j8o, acts 1885.
(7) Whenever a summons, notice, order to show cause,
order or other process has been duly issued to or against an
insurance company or other corporation created by or
organized under the laws of this state, and no officer or
agent thereof, upon whom the service of the same can be
lawfully made, can, after due diligence, be found within
the state, and such facts are made to appear by affidavit to
the satisfaction of the superior court clerk of that county
in which such summons, notice, order to show cause,
order or other process was issued, such clerk shall grant
an order that the service of such summons, notice, order to
show cause, order or other process may be made by
publishing the same, once a week for four weeks in a
newspaper published in said county, or if there be none in
said county, then in a newspaper published in the county
nearest thereto in which a newspaper is published. This
subsection shall apply also to summons, orders to show
cause, orders and notices issued by any board of aldermen,
board of town or county commissioners or by individuals.
Ch. 108 and 26J, acls 1886.
(8) When the place of residence is known and the same
is made to appear by affidavit, that in lieu of publication
in a newspaper it will be sufficient to mail a copy of the
clark's code of civil procedure.
summons, notice or other process, accompanied by a state
ment as to the nature of the action or proceeding, to the
sheriff or other process officer of the county and state where
the defendant resides, who shall serve same according to
its tenor.
There shall be attached to said summons or notice a form
substantially as follows :

County of
State of
This shall be deemed a service as complete as if made by
a sheriff or other process officer of this state : Provided,
that in case service cannot be made as herein specified, the
party desirous of obtaining such service may have the
right to make the same by publication as now provided by
law. Ch. 120, acts 1891.
Sec. 219. Manner of publication. C. CP., 8.84. 1870-'7,
c. 241, s. 3.
The order must direct the publication in any one or two
newspapers, to be designated as most likely to give notice
to the person to be served, and for such length of time as
may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week for
six weeks, a notice, giving the title of the action, the pur
pose of the same, and requiring the defendant to appear
and answer or demur to the complaint at a time and place
therein mentioned; and no publication of the summons,
nor mailing of the summons and complaint, shall be deemed
necessary.
Length of time.—The publication of the summons for four weeks is
insufficient. Burwell v. Lafferty, 76-383.
Defective publication. —Semble, that a defective service by publication
may be remedied by an order for re-publication. Price v. Cox, 83-261.
Statute strictly complied with. —Service of process by publication must
be made in strict compliance with the statutory requirements, but a mere
irregularity will not affect the validity of a judgment obtained on such
process, though sufficient ground for an application to set the judgment
aside. Spilman v. Williams, 91-483.
Publication re-ordered.—Where an order of publication is made, but, by
an oversight in the clerk, it is not done, and the defendant moves to dis
miss the action on the ground that there is a discontinuance, the judge
has the power to allow the publication to be made, returnable to a future
term of the court. Penniman v. Daniel,- 93-332.
Sec. 220. Defendant allowed to defend before and after
judgment. C. C. P., ft. 85.
The defendant against whom publication is ordered, or
his representatives, on application and sufficient cause
shown at any time before judgment, must be allowed to
defend the action; and, except in an action for divorce, the
defendant against whom publication is ordered, or his rep
resentatives, may in like manner, upon good cause shown,
be allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within
one year after notice thereof, and within five years after its
rendition, on such terms as may be just; and if the defence
be successful, and the judgment or any part thereof shall
have been collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution
may thereupon be compelled as the court may direct; but
title to property sold under such judgment to a purchaser
in good faith shall not be thereby affected.
The superior court judge must find the facts.—Upon an application for
leave to defend under this section, the judge of the superior court must
find the facts upon which the application is based, in order that the
judgment as to the sufficiency of the cause shown may be reviewed.
Utley v. Peters, 72-525.
Sec. 221. Actions' for foreclosure of mortgage. C. C. P.,
s. 80.
In actions for the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate,
if any party having any interest in, or lien upon, such
mortgaged premises is unknown to the plaintiff, and the
residence of such party cannot, with reasonable diligence,
be ascertained by him, and such fact shall be made to appear
by affidavit to the court, such court may grant an order
that a notice be served on such unknown party by publish
ing for six weeks, once in each week successively, in a
newspaper printed in the county where the premises lie, if
there be any ; if not, then in some newspaper published in
Raleigh, which publication shall be equivalent to a per
sonal service on such unknown party.
Married woman necessary party.— A married woman who joins her hus
band in executing a mortgage, is a necessary party in proceedings to
foreclose. Nimrock v. Scanlin, 87-119.
Sec. 222. Joint and several debtors; partners. C. C. P.,
s. 87.
Where the action is against two or more defendants, and
the summons is served on one or more of them, but not on
all of them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows :
(1) If the action be against defendants jointly indebted
upon contract, he may proceed against the defendants served,
unless the court otherwise direct, and if he recover judg
ment it may be entered against all the defendants thus
jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced
against the joint property of all and the separate property
of the defendants served, and, if they are subject to arrest,
against the persons of the defendants served ; or,
(2) If the action be against defendants severally liable,
he may proceed against the defendants served, in the same
manner as if they were the only defendants;
(3) If all the defendants have been served, judgment
may be taken against any or either of them severally, when
the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against such
defendant or defendants if the action had been against them
or any of them alone ;
(4) If the name of one or more partners shall, for any
cause, have been omitted in any action in which judgment
shall have passed against the defendants named in the
summons, and such omission shall not have been pleaded
in such action, the plaintiff, in case the judgment therein
shall remain unsatisfied, may by action recover of such
partner separately, upon proving his joint liability, not
withstanding he may not have been named in the original
action ; but the plaintiff shall have satisfaction of only one
judgment rendered for the same cause of action.
Service on some of the defendants. —Where the action is against two or
more defendants, and the summons is served on one or more, the plain
tiff may proceed as above directed. Mervin v. Ballard, 65-168 ; Navassa
Guano Co. v. Willard, 73-521.
See, also, \\ 185, 186, and notes, ante.
Sec. 223. Parties not summoned in action, on Joint con
tract, may be summoned after judgment. C. C P., 8. 3 IS.
C. C. P., 88. 87, 318.
When a judgment shall be recovered against one or more
of several persons jointly indebted upon a contract by pro
ceeding, as provided in the preceding section, those who
were not originally summoned to answer the complaint
may be summoned to show cause why they should not be
bound by the judgment, in the same manner as if they had
been originally summoned.
Waiver of presumption of payment. —A judgment suffered by one joint
obligor on a bond executed before 1868, does not waive the presumption
of payment as to the other obligor. Lane v. Richardson, 79-159.
Statute of limitations. —Where a judgment is obtained against a firm
upon a bill of exchange, but a secret partner in the firm is not joined as
defendant, and the plaintiff, more than three years after the cause of
action accrued, discovers that there was a secret partner, action against
such secret partner is barred by the statute of limitations. Navassa
Guano Co. v. Willard, 73-521.
Where a judgment was obtained against two members of a firm, and
more than three years after the cause of action accrued, but within three
years after obtaining such judgment, and the creditor issued a notice,
under this section of The Code, to another member of the firm who was
not served in the action in which the judgment was obtained, to show cause why he should not be bound by the judgment, to which the statute of
limitation was pleaded, such notice is the beginning of a new suit, and
the action is open to every defence which could have been set up, if there
had been no previous recovery against the other partners, and is barred
by the statute. Rufty v. Claywell, 93-306.
Proceedings by judgment creditor against the heirs and devisees. —Where
there is unreasonable delay in settling an estate, a judgment creditor
can enforce his lien by a direct proceeding against the heirs or devisees,
after three years from letters granted, to which the personal representa
tive must be made a party. Mauney v. Holmes, 87-428.
Sec. 224. Tarty summoned may answer or defend. C. C.
P., s. 322.
Any party so summoned may answer within the time
specified, denying the judgment or setting up any defence
thereto which may have arisen subsequently to such judg
ment, and may make any defence which he might have
made to the action if the summons had been served on him
at the time when the same was originally commenced and
such defence had been then interposed to such action.
Sec notes under preceding section.
Sec. 225. Subsequent pleadings and proceedings same as
in action. ft C. P., s. 323.
The party issuing the summons may demur or reply to
the answer, and the party summoned may demur to the
reply; and the issues may be tried and judgment may be
given in the same manner as in an action, and enforced by
execution, if necessary.
Sec. 220. Answer and reply to be verified as in action.
ft ft P., s. 324.
The answer and reply shall be verified in the like cases
and manner and be subject to the same rules as the answer
and reply in an action.
Sec. 227. When service complete. C. C. P., s. SS.
In the cases in which service by publication is allowed,
the summons shall be deemed served at the expiration of
the time prescribed by the order of publication, and the
party shall then be in court.
Re-order of publication. —Where a publication of a summons was only
made for five weeks, the court has power to retain the action and order
a sufficient publication. Bank v. Blossom, 92-695.
Sec. 228. Proof of service. C. C. P., s. 89.
Proof of the service of the summons or notice must be:
(1) By the certificate of the sheriff or other proper officer;
Personal service. —Personal service of summons or a written admission
of such service is necessary to constitute a case in court. A copy left
with defendant's wife is not service, nor will proof of its subsequent deliv
ery to him make it sufficient. Bank of Charlotte v. Wilson, 80-200.
Service of notice. —Proof of service of notice must be made as provided
in this section. Service by mail is not recognized. Allen v. Strickland,
100-225.
Knowledge is not service.—Where defendants knew of but took no benefit
of a sale under a judgment obtained with service of process upon them,
such knowledge cannot have the effect of a service upon them, although
they recited the proceedings in some subsequent action. Harrison v.
Harrison, 106-282.
See notes under \\ 213 and 217, ante.
(2) In case of publication, the affidavit of the printer, or
of his foreman or principal clerk, showing the same;
Service by publication. —Where the summons is served by publication,
an adjudication that the summons has beeu served is necessary before a
valid judgment can be rendered. Hyman v. Jarnigan, 65-96.
When it appears from the record that, upon affidavit, the plaintiff
obtained an order for service by publication of summons on a non-resi
dent defendant, and that there was affidavit of the publisher of a news
paper that publication was made, this court will not presume any defect
in the service in the absence of assignments specifying the particular
defects here insisted on. Lyle v. Siler, 103-261.
(3) The written admission of the defendant.
Acceptance of service.—A married woman can accept service. The time
and place of acceptance need not be endorsed on a summons returnable
to term. Nicholson v. Cox, 83-44.
Where the record shows that service was accepted, the judgment ren
dered cannot be collaterally attacked by evidence that the acceptance of
service was made by one who had no authority. Edwards v. Moore,
Where a summons issuing from the superior court of one county is
served by an officer of such county on the defendant in another county,
the defendant at the time stating to the officer that he would accept ser
vice, and to mark the summons served, which the officer did, such service
was irregular, and a judgment rendered thereon will be set aside. God
win v. Monds, 106-448.
Acceptance of service by attorney. —An attorney cannot, under his gen
eral authority, accept service for his client of the original yrjcess by
which the action is begun. Starr v. Hall, 87-381.
Admission of service. —The admission must be in writing, verified and
identified, so as to satisfy the court that it is signed by the defendaut or
with his assent. Middleton v. Duffy, 73-72.
Sec. 229. Jurisdiction, appearance, not lie of lis pendens.
C. C. P., s. 90.
From the time of the service of the summons in a civil
action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court
is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have con
trol of all subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appear
ance of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the
summons upon him. In an action affecting the title to real
property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint,
or at any time afterwards, or whenever a warrant of attach
ment shall be issued, or at any time afterwards, the plain
tiff, or a defendant when he sets up an affirmative cause of
action in his answer and demands substantive relief, at the
time of filing his answer, or at any time afterwards, if the
same be intended to affect real estate, may file with the
clerk of each county in which the property is situated, a
notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names
of the parties, the object of the action, and the description
of the property in that county affected thereby; and if the
action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage, such notice must
be filed twenty days before judgment, and must contain the
date of the mortgage, the parties thereto, and the time and
place of registering the same. From the time of filing only,
shall the pendency of the action be constructive notice to a
purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby;
and every person whose conveyance or encumbrance is sub:
sequently executed or subsequently registered shall be
deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and shall
be bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of such
notice, to the same extent as if he were made a party to
the action. For the purposes of this section an action shall
be deemed to be pending from the time of filing such notice:
Provided, that such notice shall be of no avail unless it
shall be followed by the first publication of notice of the
summons, or by an order therefor, or by the personal ser
vice on the defendant within sixty days after such filing.
And the court in which the said action was commenced
may, in its discretion, at any time after the action shall be
settled, discontinued or abated, on application of any per
son aggrieved, and on good cause shown, and on such notice
as shall be directed or approved by the court, order the
notice authorized by this section to be canceled of record
by the clerk of any county in whose office the same may
have been filed or recorded ; and such cancelation shall be
made by an indorsement to that effect on the margin of the
record, which shall refer to the order, and for which the
clerk shall be entitled to a fee of twenty-five cents.
Voluntary appearance. —A voluntary appearance is equivalent to service
of summons. Bank v. Wilson, 80-200; Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21 ; Middleton v. Duffy, 73-72 ; Moore v. Railroad, 67-209.
But does not supply the place of summons not actually issued. Etheridge v. Woodley, 83-11; contra, Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612; Moore v.
Railroad, 67-209 ; Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243 ; Middleton v. Duffy, 7372 ; Slate v. Jones, 88-683.
A general appearance waives all defects in the summons. Jones v.
Penland, 18-358; Hyatt v. Totnlin, 24-149; Duffy v. Averitt, 27-455;
Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21.
Notice of all proceedings. —A defendant upon whom a summons is served
is fixed with notice of all subsequent orders in the cause. Sparrow v.
Davidson, 77-35 ; University v. Lassiter, 83-38.
Lis pendens, when applicable. —Lis pendens does not generally apply in
proceedings to obtain alimony, but will in certain instances, as in this
case, where the land in question was all the property the defendant pos
sessed. Daniel v. Hodges, 87-95.
Lis pendens applies where there was a motion to issue a ven. ex., and
the land was aliened pending the motion. Isler v. Brown, 66-556.
Also, where there was a proceeding to subject equitable property to
the payment of a judgment. Tabb v. Williams, 57-352.
Also, where the land was the subject of a suit in equity at the time of
its alienation. Baird v. Baird, 62-317.
Lis pendens, when not necessary.—A lis pendens is not necessary to bind
a purchaser with notice, who buys land at an execution sale in the
county where the litigation was pending. Rollins v Henry, 78-352.
If property is transferred by the defendant pending a suit involving
its title, in which there is afterwards a judgment for the plaintiff, the
judgment relates to the begining of the action, and binds the property
in the hands of the purchaser, and when the transaction and suit are in
the same county and the record furnishes evidence of the claim, this
rule is not affected by the provisions of this section. Dancy v. Duncan,
96-m.
Strangers to an action are not affected with constructive notice of an
action involving the title to lands situate in a county other than that in
which the action is pending, unless the notice lis pendens is given
under this section ; but even purchasers for value, although not parties,
are affected by such notice if the lands are in the county where the
action is pending and the pleadings describe them with reasonable cer
tainty. Spencer v. Credle, 102-68.
Where the lands are situated in the county where the action is pend
ing and the pleadings sufficiently indicate the property and the charac
ter of the litigation, that is a substantial compliance with this section.
• Collingwood v. Brown, 106-362.
Lis pendens notice to all the world.—A lispendens filed only in the county
where litigation is pending is yet notice, constructively, in every county
in the state from the date of the filing. Todd v. Outlaw, 79-235.
Before the C. C. P. the pendency of an action for land was notice to
all the world. Baird v. Baird, 62-217.
This section is a substitute for the common law lis pendens and must
be filed in every county where the property is situated, other than the
county in which the action is brought. Collingwood v. Brown, 106-362.
Property must be specifically described.—A party to an action desiring to
claim the protection of a notice by lis pendens must describe the prop
erty specifically in his pleadings. Badger v. Daniel, 77-251 ; Todd v.
Outlaw, 79-235.
Lis pendens by a third party.—One who is refused leave to be made a
party to the action can protect his interest in the subject-matter of the
controversy by filing a lis pendens in each county where the land lies
and instituting proceedings. Toms v. Warson, 66-417.
Sec. 230. Parties may apply for reliefto the superior court
in vacation or in term time. 1871-'2, c.3, s. 1.
In all cases where the superior court in vacation has
jurisdiction, and all of the parties unite in the proceedings,
they may apply for relief to the superior court in vacation,
or in term time, at their election.
Judgment by consent in vacation. —By consent of parties, a judgment can
be taken in vacation. Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243 ! Harrell v. Peebles,
79-26.
Sec. 231. Forma of pleading. C. C. P., s. 01.
The forms of pleading in civil actions in courts of record,
and the rules by which the sufficiency of the pleadings is
to be determined, are those prescribed by this Code.
Common law rules of pleading.—The rules of pleading at common law as
regards materiality, certainty, prolixity, obscurity, etc., prevail under
the C. C. P. Crump v. Minis, 64-767.
The rules of pleading and construction at the common law have not
been abrogated. The essential principles remain, and have only been
modified as to technicalities and matters of form. Parsley v. Nichol
son, 65-207.
The object of The Code was to abolish the different forms of action,
and the technical and artificial modes of pleading used at common law,
but not to dispense with regularity, certainty and uniformity, which are
essential in every system. The plaintiff must state his cause of action
with the same substantial certainty that was formerly required in a dec
laration. Oates v. Gray, 66-442; Vass v. Building Association, 91-55.
Former system of pleading utterly abolished. —The subtle science of plead
ing heretofore in use is not merely relaxed but is abolished by the C. C.
P. Moore v. Edmiston, 70-510 ; Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394.
While The Code nowhere expressly adopts the doctrine of aider by
admissions expressed or implied in pleading over, the principle com
mends itself so strongly by its good sense, that it must be taken to
underlie every system of procedure professing to put controversies on
their merits, to aim at furtherance of justice and not to allow actions to
go off upon subtleties and refinements. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430.
Only one form of action. —If there is anything settled in our new system,
it is that there is but one form of action. There are torts and contracts
just as there used to be ; but there are not several forms of action as
there used to be ; and the pleadings are not now suited for different
forms of action but all are suited to one form of action, whether the
subject of the action be tort or contract. Bitting v. Thaxton, 72-541.
A complaint alleging that the defendant, a common carrier, failed to
safely carry certain articles of freight according to contract, and "so
negligently and carelessly conducted in regard to the same that it was
greatly damaged," states facts sufficient to constitute a tort. Bowers v.
Railroad, 107-721.
Under the present method of procedure, parties may allege their
cause of action, and their rights in and about the same, whether legal
or equitable, in the same action. Bean v. Railroad, 107-731.
Where the complaint does not allege fraud, in terms, but does set
forth facts which, being denied by the defendant, raise issues as to unfair
ness, surprise and undue advantage, by means of which an instrument
was obtained, the conrt will not let the defendant, take advantage of it.
Bean v. Railroad, 107-731.
A cause of action may sometimes be so stated as to authorize a recovery
by proof either of a quantum meruit or of an express contract. Lewis
v. Railroad, 95-179; Fulps v. Mock, 108-601.
No pleading filed. —The purpose of the summons is to bring the parties
into court; the purpose of the pleadings is to give jurisdiction of the
subject-matter of litigation, and of the parties in that connection. These
are generally necessary, but when the parties are voluntarily before the
court, and by agreement, consent or confession, which are the same in
substance, a judgment is rendered, such judgment is valid, although
not granted according to the regular course of procedure, and even when
there are no pleadings filed and no summons. Peoples v. Norwood,
94-167.
Only the forms prescribed in this section remain. —All previous forms of
pleading are abolished, and now there exists only the forms of pleading
and the rules by which their sufficiency is determined as prescribed by
this section Jones v. Mial, 82-252 ; Gorman v. Bellamy, 82-496.
On a complaint alleging a contract for services rendered, if the plain
tiff fail to prove a special contract, he can still recover on a quantum
meruit without amendment. Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394.

CLARK'S CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
All form not abolished—All the forms of pleadings heretofore existing are
abolished, but all form is not abolished. Moore v. Hobbs, 79-535.
Sec. 232. Complaint. C. C. P., s. 92.
The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff is the com
plaint.
Complaint shows the nature of the action.—The summons brings the par
ties into court. The nature of the action is shown by the complaint.
Barneycastle v. Walker, 92-198.
When additional party defendant is made. —When, during the progress of
the action, another party defendant is brought in, the complaint should
be amended or another complaint filed as to him, unless he waives
this by answering the original complaint (Vass v, Building Association,
91-55), DUt this is not necessary when the new parties come in by suc
cession to a party who dies, and the relationship appears. Hughes v.
Hodges, 94-56. Same rule as to new plaintiffs. Richards v. Smith, 98-509.
Withdrawing suit. —The plaintiff may, at any time before the defend
ant has pleaded a counterclaim, submit to a nonsuit, and withdraw his
suit. Bank v. Stewart, 93-402,
See cases cited under \ 238.
Cause of action must exist when action brought—The cause of action must
exist at the time the action was begun, and the plaintiff will not be
allowed, by amendment, to introduce a cause of action which had no
existence when the summons was issued. Clendenin v. Turner, 96-416 ;
Bynmn v. Com'rs, 101-412 ; Metcalf v. Guthrie, 94-447.
Pleadings must state facts, not evidence. —Pleadings should not state the
evidence, but the facts, which are conclusions from the evidence, accord
ing to their legal effect ; and complaints should avoid stating matters
which, if traversed, would not lead to a decisive issue. Crump v.
Mims, 64-767.
Affidavit in claim and delivery not a complaint. —The affidavit in claim and
delivery is not a substitute for a complaint, and averments therein will not
cure defects in summons or complaint. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
Complaint sufficient.—The rigorous particularity requisite under the old
system is not required in filing a complaint under the C C P. Brown
v. Morris, 83-251.
Although it is more orderly to state each cause of action in a separate
and distinct allegation, yet if it fully appear from the complaint what
each demand is, the failure to do so is not ground of demurrer. Moore
v. Nowell, 94-265.
It is sufficient if the complaint states facts sufficient to show that a
legal wrong has been done by the defendants, for which the law will
afford redress. McElwee v. Blackwell, 94-261.
Although the allegations in a complaint are indefinite, yet if it con
tains facts sufficient to give the defendant such information as will enable
him to intelligently make his defence, the complaint is not demurrable.
If necessary, the court will order the plaintiff to make the allegations
more specific. The Code, fj 261 ; Nance v. Railroad, 94-619.
A motion to dismiss because the complaint does not state facts suffi
cient to constitute a cause of action will not be entertained, when the
cause is tried upon an agreed statement of facts, which supply the omis
sions in the complaint. Hines v. Railroad, 95-434.
If the complaint alleges several causes of action, some of which are
bad, but one is g^ood, it is error to sustain a demurrer to the whole com
plaint. The plaintiff should be allowed to proceed upon his good assign
ment. Strange v. Manning, 99-165.
A complaint which alleges that plaintiff was an employee of the
defendant railway company, and was injured by the negligence of the
engineer in charge of the locomotive, without any allegation that the
engineer was incompetent, and that the company, with knowledge of
that fact, retained him in service, does not set out a cause of action, and
the action will be dismissed. Hagins v. Railroad, 106-537.
Where the complaint does not allege fraud in terms, but does set forth
facts which, being denied by the defendant, raises issues as to unfair
ness, surprise or undue advantage, by means of which an instrument
was obtained, the court will not let the defendant take advantage of it.
Bean v. Railroad, 107-731.
"Proviso" in statute. —Where a statute giving a right of action con
tains a proviso, the plaintiff need not negative it, but if the case falls
within the proviso the defendant must set it up in the answer. Wadsworth v. Stewart, 97-116.
Sec. 233. Complaint, what to contain. C. C. P., s. 93.
The complaint shall contain—
(1) The title of the cause, specifying the name of the
court in which the action is brought, the name of the county
in which the trial is required to be had, and the names of
the parties to the action, plaintiff .and defendant ;
Names should be set out. —In all actions and proceedings demanding
relief, the names of all the parties thereto should be properly set forth
in the summons and pleadings. A general designation of them as " the
heirs of M. C," is irregular, and will not be tolerated. Kerlee v. Corpening, 97-330.
(2) A plain and concise statement of the facts constitut
ing a cause of action, without unnecessary repetition ; and
each material allegation shall be distinctly numbered;
What the complaint must contain. —The complaint is required to contain
a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting a cause of action,
without unnecessary repetition, and a demand of the relief to which the
plaintiff supposes himself entitled. Jones v. Mial, 82-252.
Few, if any, of the ancient rules of pleading are now applicable. All
that is required of the plaintiff is a plain and concise statement of the
facts constituting a cause of action. Gorman v. Bellamy, 82-496.
The complaint shall contain a "plain and concise statement of the
cause of action." Moore v. Hobbs, 77-65.
The plaintiff must state his cause of action with the same substantial
certainty as was formerly required in a declaration. Oates v. Grav, 66442.
A memorandum of a claim is not a complaint. Isler v. Murphy, 76-52.
The complaint in an action against a married woman. —The complaint in
an action against a married woman must allege that she is possessed of a separate estate, that the contract is such as she is competent to make,
and that it is for her advantage. Dougherty v. Sprinkle, 88-300.
The complaint, in an action to enforce an executory contract of a
married woman, should allege that she has a separate estate subject to .
the charge sought to be enforced, and the execution can issue against
that alone. Flaum v. Wallace, 103-296.
In an action for divorce. —In a divorce suit, where a wife alleges ill treat
ment by her husband, but fails to state the circumstances connected with
the assaults charged and the causes which brought them on, the com
plaint-is insufficient. White v. White, 84-340; Jackson v. Jackson, 105-433.
In an action against county commissioners. —A complaint in an action by a
board of commissioners against a defaulting tax-collector is demurrable
if it fail to state that the county treasurer fails and refuses to bring the
action. Commissioners of Pender v. McPherson, 79-524.
In action to enforce a right-of-way. —In an action to enforce a right-ofway, the complaint must show how the plaintiff became entitled to such
right. Boyden v. Achenbach, 79-539.
In an action to recover land.—A complaint, in an action to recover real
estate, which alleges that the defendant withholds the possession of the
premises described, but does not aver that it is wrongfully withheld, is
defective. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430.
When the complaint demands the possession of land, nothing more is
put in issue than a right of entry or a right of present possession—at least,
when no particular estate is alleged in the complaint. Whether a judg
ment in an action in which the complaint alleged a certain estate would
be an estoppel between the parties is a question too nice to be decided
until the case shall arise for consideration. Harkey v. Houston, 65-137.
A complaint, in an action to recover laud, which alleges that the
plaintiff is the owner in fee, describes the same by metes and bounds,
and alleges that the defendant wrongfully withholds possession, con
cluding with a demand for judgment for the possession, for damages for
withholding the same, and for costs, is amply sufficient under The Code.
Johnston v. Pate, 83-110.
An action to recover the possession of land, and to correct a mutual
mistake in a deed for the same land executed by the plaintiff to the
defendant, constitute but one cause of action. Ely v. Early, 94-1.
Where, in an action to recover several tracts of land in the separate
possession of several defendants, the complaint does not allege of which
tract each defendant is in possession, this constituted no ground for
demurrer. Thames v. Jones, 97-121.
In an action to recover land, if the complaint allege, generally, title
and right of possession, the plaintiff, on the trial, may offer evidence of
any title which may entitle him to recover ; but if he set out his title
specifically, it seems he will be required to prove it as alleged. Richards
v. Smith, 98-509.
In an action to recover land, it is sufficient if the complaint distinctly
describes the land and alleges that the defendant is in the unlawful pos
session and refuses to surrender, without setting forth what particular
portion he withholds. Speight v. Jenkins, 99-143.
In an action of ejectment, and the modern substitute for it— an action
for the possession of land—the plaintiff must allege and show that
defendant held adverse possession at the time of action brought, and
that he is entitled to the immediate possession. Brown v. King, 107-313.
In an action for usury. —Where a complaint in an action for usury speci
fied the principal sum constituting the original debt, and the dates and
amounts of the usurious payments of interest, it is sufficiently definite,
as it furnishes the defendant with all the information necessary to make
his defence. Morgan v. Bank, 93-352.
In an action against a national bank for usury, the complaint need not
negative that there are no state banks of issue which by law are allowed
to charge more than eight per cent. Ibid.
In an action for malicious arrest. —In an action for having the defendant
arrested maliciously and without probable cause, the complaint should
allege that the action in which the arrest was made has been terminated.
Johnson v. Finch, 93-205.
In an action for malicious prosecution. —In an action for malicious prose
cution, the complaint should allege that the process was void, or was
issued without probable cause, or that it was prompted by malice, and
that the proceedings thereunder have terminated. Barfield v. Turner,
IOI-357In an action for personal property by officer. —Where the cause of action
alleged was that the plaintiff became entitled to the possession of per
sonal property sued for by virtue of a levy of executions issued to him
as an officer, it is not necessary to set forth in the complaint the process
under which the seizure was made. Pendland v. Leatherwood, 101-509.
In an action for damages. —The rules of pleading are not so stringent
as to require special averment in the complaint of every immediate cause
of injury, in an action for damages. Hammond v. Schiff, 100-161.
In an action to impeach a deed. — If it is desired to attack a deed between
husband and wife, upon the ground that it was executed in contempla
tion of a separation, that allegation must be duly made in the pleadings.
Barnes v. Barnes, 104-613.
In an action for distributive share. —In an action brought against admin
istrator for an account within two years, ft is not essential for the com
plaint to allege that there is "no necessity for retaining the funds,"
under \ 1512 of The Code. Allen v. Royster, 107-278.
In an action on note. —The payee or endorsee of a note is prima facie
the owner and holder, and it is unnecessary that he should make such an
allegation in his complaint. Deloatch v. Vinson, 10S-147.
In an action for slander. —In an action for slander, the complaint must
set out the actionable words spoken, and not simply a narrative of what
occurred. Burns v. Williams, 88-159.
In action of debt. —The complaint in debt upon simple contract must
set out the consideration among other facts. Moore v. Hobbs, 79-535.
In actions upon parol contracts, it is necessary that the complaint
should disclose a sufficient consideration. Burbage v. Windley, 108-357.
In an action for account. —If a settlement is conditional, upon the per
formance of certain things thereafter to be done by one of the parties
thereto, but which have never been performed, it is not necessary, in an
action for account, to allege the specific errors therein. Quarles v.
Jenkins, 98-258.
In an action for penalty.—In an action to recover the penalty given
against registers of deeds for issuing marriage license in violation of
(! 1816, The Code, it is essential that the complaint should allege that
the register issued the license knowingly or without reasonable inquiry.
Brown v. Mitchell, 102-347, approved. Maggett v. Roberts, 108-174.
In an action for an office. —In an action to recover possession of an office
to which the relator alleges he was duly chosen, but was excluded there
from by the illegal action of the board of canvassers in rejecting certain
returns, it is not necessary to set forth in the complaint, specifically, the
errors which the board committed : an averment that the relator was
duly elected, and is unlawfully prevented from the enjoyment of the
office is sufficient. Kilburn v. Patterson, 98-593.
In an action against a corporation. —In a suit against a railroad company,
it may be designated by its corporate name without alleging its incor
poration. Stanly v. Railroad, 89-331 ; Ramsay v. Railroad, 91-418.
In an action on a laborer's lien. —It is essential to the validity of a
laborer's lien, that the "claim," or notice, which he is required to file,
shall set forth, in detail, the times when the lalwr was performed, its
character, the amount due therefor and upon what property it was
employed ; and if it is for materials furnished, the same particularity is
required. Defects in these respects, will not be cured by alleging the
necessary facts in the pleadings in an action brought to enforce the
lien. Cook v. Cobb, 101-68 ; Wray v Harris, 77-77.
In an action for converting mortgaged crop. —A complaint for converting
a mortgaged crop, which avers the title to such crop raised by the
mortgagor, and by him conveyed to the plaintiff, its delivery to the
defendant, its value, and its appropriation by the defendant to his own
use after demand by the plainti.T, is in full compliance with the require
ments of this section. Womble v. Leach, 83-84.
In an action on policy of insurance. —In an action on a policy of insur
ance a copy of the application need not be set out in the complaint.
Britt v. Insurance Co., 105-175, overruling (on this point) Bobbitt v.
Insurance Co., 66-70.
New promise. —Where an action is brought to enforce payment of a
bond and a new promise is relied on to rebut an alleged compromise and
satisfaction, the complaint should declare on the bond, and the new
promise be relied on to rebut the compromise. King v. Phillips,
94-555Quantum meruit. —Where the complaint alleged that the plaintiff was
employed as the engineer by the defendant, and rendered services as
such, he can recover either on the special contract, or on the common
count. Lewis v Railroad, 95-179 ; Fulps v. Mock, 108-601.
Bill of Review. —An action in the nature of a bill of review, can only
be maintained upon three grounds : 1. For error apparent on the face
of the decree; 2. For new matter discovered since the decree was
rendered and 3, for fraud. In such an action it is not competent to
look into the evidence to ascertain if any fact was misconceived, or that
the decree was based on an erroneous statement of facts. Farrar v Staton, 101-78.
Two unconnected causes of action. —A complaint containing two uncon
nected causes of action against different persons is demurrable. Burns
v. Williams. 88-159.
A plaintiff cannot join in the same complaint a cause of action against
one of two defendants, with another, against both. N. C Land Co. v.
Beatty, 69-329.
See \ 267, post, and cases there cited.
Non-suit as to some of the causes of action.—Where the complaint set out
three causes of action, and on the trial the plaintiff entered a nonsuit as
to two of them, he is entitled to prosecute his action as to the remain
ing cause of action. Grant v. Burgwyn, 84-560.
Recovery must be solely on facts stated in the complaint. —A plaintiff can
not recover upon a state of facts other than those set out in his com
plaint except by amendment of his complaint. Shelton v. Davis,
69-324; Browning v. Berry, 107-231.
The plaintiff must allege his cause of action in the complaint, and
he cannot recover on a cause of action set out in the pleadings of his
adversary. Willis v. Branch, 94-142 ; Johnson v. Finch, 93-205.
Where the plaintiff declared for one undivided half, he can recover
no more. Cox v. Ward, 107-507.
Aider.—Where the cause of action is defectively stated in the com
plaint it may be aided by the facts alleged in the answer. Willis v.
Branch, 94-142 ; Harris v. Sneeden, 104-369. See cases cited, 242, post.
When a judgment will cure the absence of a complaint. —Judgment cures
the absence of a complaint especially where the specialty is filed as a
substitute and the summons names the amount Vick v. Pope, 81-22 ;
Leach v. Railroad, 65-485 ; Peoples v. Norwood, 94-167 ; Little v. McCarter, 89-233 ; Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
A judgment rendered without any complaint having been filed is not
necessarily void. Such judgment is valid if rendered by consent, or if
ratified by subsequent assent to it. Stancill v. Gay, 92-455.
See,, also, ^179, 183, 184, 185, 186, 223 and 231, ante; also, $§239,
especially 239 (6), 260, 261, 269, 270, 271, 274, post, and cases cited under
them.
(3) A demand of the relief to which the plaintiff sup
poses himself entitled.
If the recovery of money be
demanded, the amount thereof must be stated.
Defect in the demand for judgment immaterial.—Any informality or defect
of the demand for judgment is immaterial, and cannot be ground for
demurrer or other objection so long as the sum demanded (in an action
for money only) appears from the summons, and how it is due, from the
complaint. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
Under the C. C. P., the prayer for relief is most obviously a material
part of the complaint. But semble that failure to insert such prayer is
not fatal. Davis v. Ely, 100-283.
A formal prayer for relief is not now essential ; the court will render
such judgment as the fads, proved or admitted, demand, not inconsist
ent with the pleadings, notwithstanding the party may have miscon
ceived his remedy. Jones v. Mial, 79-168 ; Harris v. Sneeden, 104-369.
A party can recover judgment for any relief to which the facts alleged
and proved entitle him, whether demanded in the prayer for relief or
not. McNeill v. Hodges, 105-52.
A formal prayer for relief is not now necessary in a complaint ; and in
an action for slander separate demands for damages need not be appended
to the various allegations setting up the causes of action. Gudger v.
Perland, 108-593.
Plaintiff entitled to any relief not inconsistent with the pleadings. —No gen
eral prayer need be expressed in the pleadings, but is always implied.
The party is not restricted to the specific relief demanded, but may
have any relief justified by the facts proven, and not inconsistent with
the pleadings. Knight v. Houghtaling, 85-17.
The relief, if there be no answer, shall not exceed that demanded in
the complaint, but in any other case any relief may be granted consistent
with the case made by the complaint and embraced in the issue. Jones
v. Mial, 82-252.
.
..4
Under the present system of practice, there being but one form of
action, it is the office of the complaint to set forth the fads upon which
the plaintiff's right to relief is based, and if they are adjudged sufficient
the court will direct the appropriate remedy. Moore v. Cameron, 9351 ; Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93-38.
A plaintiff is entitled to such relief as the facts stated in his complaint
will admit, although he misconceives the manner in which it may be
afforded. Patrick v. Railroad, 93-422.
The prayer for judgment does not fix the plaintiff's right, but the
court should grant such judgment as the allegations in the pleadings
will warrant. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
In an action equitable in its nature, the court may give such relief as
"the facts and pleadings may render appropriate, though it be not prayed
in the complaint, and it may, to that end, order the pleadings to be
reformed to correspond with the facts established. Barnes v. Barnes,
104-613.
The existence of other remedies against the defendant, as in this case,
does not impair the one chosen. McEachin v. Stewart, 106-336.
The law does not favor a multiplicity of motions, when one will put
an end to the controversy, and sufficient ground appears of record to
sustain it, though not relied on by the party seeking relief. Skinner v.
Terry, 107-103.
Jurisdiction. —While the sum demanded ordinarily determines the juris
diction, the plaintiff's demand must be made in good faith, and not for
the purpose of giving jurisdiction. The superior court has no jurisdic
tion of an action upon a running account for $312, which has been
reduced by payments to less than $200. Wiseman v. Witherow, 90-140.
It is the sum which is demanded in good faith, which confers jurisdic
tion, and where the plaintiff's demand consists of several distinct items,
it is the aggregate which constitutes the sum demanded and confers
jurisdiction. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
In actions arising out of contract, it is the sum demanded that fixes
the jurisdiction. Brantley v. Finch, 97-91.
A mere demand of judgment for amount of damages greater than are
alleged in the complaint, will not avail to give the superior court juris
diction. Bowers v. Railroad, 107-721.
Before justice of the peace. —Where the sum demanded, both in the sum
mons and on the trial, was two hundred dollars, but the plaintiff filed
an account showing more than that sum to be due, the justice had juris
diction without any remission of the excess of the account over the sum
demanded. Brantley v. Finch, 97-91.
It is only when the principal sum demanded exceeds two hundred dol
lars that the plaintiff is required to remit the excess above that sum in
order to give the justice jurisdiction. Ibid.
In an action before a justice of the peace in which two causes of action
were alleged, the first sufficiently, but the second defectively, for want of
proper averment of jurisdictional facts, the justice may proceed to judg
ment upon the first. Mgf. Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
Prayer too late after judgment. —In an action to have the holder of the
legal title declared a trustee, it is too late after final judgment to ask for
an account of the rents and profits. Brendle v. Herren, 97-257.
Sec. 234. Complaint in action to recover debt contracted
for the purchase of land, what to set forth. 1870, c, 217.
In actions for the recovery of a debt contracted for the
purchase of land, it shall be the duty of the plaintiff to set
forth in his complaint that the consideration of the debt
sued on was the purchase-money of certain land, describ
ing said land in an intelligible manner, such as the number
of acres, how bounded, and where situated.
Allegations not necessary. — In an action on a note for purchase-money
for land, it is not necessary to allege in the complaint that the title was
good, or that plaintiff has tendered a deed. It is otherwise in an action
for specific performance. Toms v. Fite, 93-274.
Presumption of allegation. —If the judgment of the court recites the
fact that the debt was contracted for the purchase of land, such recital
is conclusive as between the parties to the record. And where that fact
is recited in a judgment rendered by a justice of the peace, though the
pleadings may have been oral, it is likewise conclusive—the presump
tion, in the absence of anything to the contrary appearing, being that
the judgment was rendered after a trial in which the recited fact was
duly established. Durham v. Wilson, 104-595.
Section does not apply.—This section docs not apply where a deed has
not been executed to the vendee. Lewis v. McDowell, SS-261.
Sec. 2'iii. If answen denies that debt was contracted for
purchase of land, issue to he submitted to jury. 1870, c.
217.
If the defendant shall deny in his answer that the obli
gation sued on was for the purchase-money of the land
described in the complaint, it shall be the duty of the court
to submit the issue so joined to the jury.
Sec. 230. Form of Judgment and execution upon judg
ment for plaintiff. 1879, c. 217.
If the answer does not deny the said allegation so set
forth in the complaint, or if the said issue shall be found
by the jury in favor of the plaintiff, it shall be the duty of
the court to have embodied in the judgment, that the debt
sued on was one contracted for the purchase-money of said
laud, describing it briefly ; and it shall also be the duty of
the clerk to set forth in the execution, that the said debt
was one contracted for the purchase of said land, the
description of which shall be set out briefly, as in the
complaint.
Waiver of jury trial. —Although the statute gives the defendant a right
to have the issue, whether the debt sued on was contracted for the pur
chase of land, tried by a jury, if he so demands, yet, if after being duly
summoned, he fails to appear and answer, he waives that right. Dur
ham v. Wilson, 104-595.
Execution. —A sheriff is justified in refusing to sell the homestead
under an execution issued upon a judgment, which does not specify
that it is rendered for the purchase-money due for such homestead.
Should he, however, sell in such a case, the sale is valid. Durham v.
Bostick, 72-353Sec. 237. Defendant lo/tie bond in action forreal property.
18(i'J-'70, c. 19.1, s. 1.
In all actions for the recovery of real property, or for the
possession thereof, the defendant, before he is permitted to
plead, answer or demur, shall execute and file in the office
of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein
the suit is pending, an undertaking with good and suffi
cient surety, in an amount to be fixed by the court, not
less than two hundred dollars, to be void upon condition
that the defendant pay to the plaintiff all such costs and
damages as the plaintiff may recover in the action, includ
ing damages for .the loss of rents and profits : Provided,
that no such undertaking shall be required if an attorney,
practicing in the court wherein the action is pending, will
certify to the court in writing that he has examined the
case of the defendant and is of the opinion that the plain
tiff is not entitled to recover, and if the defendant will
also file an affidavit, stating that he is not worth the amount
of said undertaking in any property whatsoever, and is
unable to give the same.
Bond secures damages as well as costs. —The bond of defendant secures
damages as well as costs. Rollins v. Henry, 77-467.
Summary judgment against sureties. —Upon judgment being rendered
against the defendant in an action to recover land, it is not error to enter
up a summary judgment against the sureties on his bond. Rollins v.
Henry, S4-569.
Where landlord is joined with tenant as a defendant. —While the landlord
may be joined with the tenant as a defendant, each must give bond or
be relieved of doing so under above section. Should the tenant fail to
give bond, judgment can be taken against him, but no execution will
issue till the defence set up by the defendant landlord is passed upon.
Harkey v. Houston, 65-137.
Defendant in forma pauperis.—A defendant who is allowed to defend an
action for the recovery of land without giving bond is entitled to recover
costs. Justice v. Eddings, 75-581.
Where the defendant is allowed upon affidavit to defend without giv
ing security for costs, he is neither exempted from paying costs if judg
ment is rendered against him, nor prevented from recovering costs.
Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348.
The statute simply relieves him from giving the undertaking. Dempsey v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Affidavit. —In an action to recover land, this section was sufficiently
complied with when the defendant made affidavit that he was not worth
two hundred dollars in any property whatever, and was unable to give
the undertaking required, and his counsel certified that they had exam
ined his case and were of opinion he " had good defence to the action. "
Refusal of the court, upon such affidavit and certificate, to allow him to
plead, answer or demur without giving security, because it also appeared
that he was worth real estate to the value of one hundred and twentyfive dollars, was error. Nor does the statute provide that in such cases
the court may require a less sum than two hundred dollars. The pur
pose of the law is to provide for persons too poor to give the undertak
ing ordinarily required, and the court has no discretion in the matter.
The law in this respect is not changed by The Code, \ 117, which simply
provides for a mortgage in lien of security. Wilson v. Fowler, 104-471.
A defendant is entitled to defend without giving bond, upon affidavit
of inability, in accordance with the requirement of the act in force when
suit was brought. Taylor v. Apple, 90-345.
Certificate of counsel. —It is not required that the enquiry of counsel
should extend beyond the information derived from the defendant, and
such as counsel may possess in addition, upon which, as safe and prudent
advisers, they would undertake to act. Ibid.
The certificate of counsel applies only to the action as then consti
tuted, and not to any other possible action that might be brought by
plaintiff for same or similar relief. Wilson v. Fowler, 104-471.
No notice required. —No notice is required of an application for leave to
defend without giving bond, upon filing the affidavit specified in this
section. Deal v. Palmer, 68-215.
Leave not a matter of discretion. —Where the requirements of the proviso
in this section are complied with, leave to defend without giving bond is
a matter of right, and does not rest in the discretion of the judge. Jones
v. Fortune, 69-322; Dempsey v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Conditional order. —Where a judge granted a judgment for plaintiff in
an action for the possession of land, to be stricken out if defendant filed
a proper bond in thirty days after adjournment of court, the judgment
was void, and the clerk had the power to make an order allowing defend
ant to answer without bond, upon his filing the affidavit and the certifi
cate of counsel required by law. Strickland v. Cox, 102-411.
Mortgage in lieu of bond.—A mortgage given under \ 120 of The Code in
lien of the bond required by this section (237) may be foreclosed by
motion, upon notice, in the original action. Ryan v. Martin, 103-282;
ibid., 104-176.
Waiver of bond.—The bond under this section of The Code is for the
benefit of the plaintiff, and he can waive it, and- will be deemed to have
done so, if he allows a number of terms of court to pass without demand
ing it. If not waived entirely, it is waived until demanded. McMillan
v. Baker, 92-110.
Where, in an action to recover land, the defendant failed to file a bond
to secure costs and damages, as required by The Code, 'i 237, it is error
to strike out the answer on a motion made at the trial term, without
giving the defendant an opportunity to file a bond at that time. Ibid.
Additional security can be required.—The court, in a proper case, has the
power to order the defendant to give additional security, and, on his
failure to comply, can strike out the answer and award judgment.
Vaughan v. Vincent, 88-116.
Receiver can be appointed. —The requirement that a defendant shall give
bond for costs and damages before answering does not abridge the power
of the court to appoint a receiver of the rents and profits. Kron v.
Dennis, 90-327.
Time extended. —In a proper case the court could extend the time for
filing the undertaking. Taylor v. Pope, 106-267.
When there is a severance. —When a separate trial is ordered for defend
ants, each must comply with this section. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95.
Vendee in possession. —Where a vendee is let into possession before the
purchase-money is paid, and the vendor brings an action to recover the
possession, the defendant must file the undertaking to secure rents and
damages provided for by this section, before he will be allowed to
answer. Allen v. Taylor, 96-27.
Sec, 238. Defendant to demur or answer, C. C. P., s. 04.
The only pleading on the part of the defendant is either
a demurrer or an answer. If the plaintiff shall have failed
to file his complaint within the time limited for the pur
pose, the defendant may move for judgment of nonsuit.
Defence must be presented in apt time. —As a general rule, the defence
must be presented in apt time, or it is waived. This rule does not apply
where the complaint is one on which a judgment could not be given.
Pearce v. Mason, 78-37.
Effect of demurrer. —By demurring, the defendant admits the truth of
the testimony in the aspect most favorable to the plaintiff. Bond v.
Wool, 107-139.
The distinction between a demurrer to the complaint and a demurrer
to the evidence stated. McCaudless v. Flinchum, 98-35S.
Oral testimony. —Oral testimony is not admissible to show the grounds
upon which a court proceeded in rendering judgment upon a demurrer.
Baker v. Garris, 108-218.
A demurrer precedes an answer. —A demurrer precedes an answer, and
cannot be put in after it, without leave obtained to withdraw the answer.

The only pleading by defendant.—Tin; only pleading on the pirt of the
defendant is a demurrer or answer. McClenahan v. Cotten, 83-332.
A motion for nonsuit not a substitute for a demurrer. —A motion for non
suit cannot be made a substitute for demurrer. If the complaint does
not set forth a cause of action, the defendant should demur. He cannot
take advantage of a demurrable defect by this motion. Andrews v.
Pritchett, 66-387.
The use of the word "pleading."—The use of the word "plead" and
"pleading" in acts subsequent to the C. C. P., have not the effect to
reinstate to any degree the former system. Oates v. Gray, 66-442.
Statute of limitations. —When the statute of limitations is relied upon
as a defence, it must be set up by answer ; it cannot be taken advantage
of by demurrer. Green v. Railroad Co., 73-524.
Pendency of former action,—The objection of the pendency of a former
action must be taken by answer. Harris v Johnson, 65-478.
Several defendants jointly liable. —Where defendants are jointly liable,
one cannot answer and another demur, but all must join either in a
demurrer or answer. Von Glahn v. DeRossett, 76-292.
An answer or reply overrules a demurrer. —If a defendant demur to a com
plaint, or a plaintiff to an answer, and afterwards answer or reply, before
the hearing on his demurrer, such answer or reply overrules the demurrer
and waives all objection taken thereby, excepting only that to the juris
diction of the court, and that a cause of action is not stated. Hyman
v. Devereux, 63-624.
A defendant is to answer or demur ; if he answers, the plaintiff is to
reply or demur; but neither can reply and demur to the same cause of
action or the same defence at the same time, and if he does so, the
answer or reply waives the demurrer. Ransom v. McClees, 64-17.
A plaintiff can elect to be nonsuited. — A plaintiff may elect to be non
suited in every case when no judgment, other than for costs, can be
recovered against him ; when a judgment other than for costs may be
had against him, he cannot so elect. McKesson v. Mendenhan, 64-502.
A plaintiff may elect to be nonsuited after the defendant has moved
to dismiss for want of jurisdiction upon the judge intimating ail opinion
against him. Pescud v. Hawkins, 71-299.
The plaintiff can elect to be nonsuited. Wharton v. Currituck, 82-11 ;
Graham v. Tate, 77-120 ; Tate v. Phillips, 77-126.
A judgment of nonsuit against a portion of the plaintiffs, terminates
the action as to all. Lafoou v. Shearin, 95-391.
Plaintiffs may submit to a nonsuit at any time before verdict, unless
in actions of an equitable nature the adverse party shall have acquired
some right which he is entitled to have determined. Gatewood v. Leak,
See \ 282, post, and cases cited.
Judgment on demurrer an estoppel. —A judgment rendered upon demurrer,
when there is no amendment nor appeal, is as conclusive, by way of
estoppel, as a verdict finding the facts confessed would have been. John
son v. Pate, 90-334.
.Sec. 23U. When defendant may demur. C. C, P., s. 95.
The defendant may demur to the complaint when it shall
appear upon the face thereof, either—
What demurrable,—A demurrer can only be sustained for one of the
causes of demurrer specifically set out in this section. Dunn v. Barnes,
73-273.
If any one allegation is defective it extends to the whole of that cause
of action, and a demurrer will be sustained. Speight v. Jenkins, 99-143.
Frivolous demurrer. —A demurrer upon the ground that the complaint
fails to set out that the plaintiffs constitute a firm, and that the debt is
due to them, as such, and also fails to set out the names of the persons
composing the firm, is frivolous, and entitles the plaintiff to judgment
on his complaint. Cowan v. Baird, 77-201.
Any informality in the demand for judgment is not ground for demur
rer, when, in an action for money only, the sum demanded and how it
is due, appear either from the summons or the complaint. Dunn v. Barnes,
73-273.
See, also, Johnston v. Pate, 83-110, in notes to subsection 6 of this section.
Misjoinder of unnecessary parties. —The misjoinder of unnecessary par
ties, either as plaintiffs or defendants, is mere surplusage, and not de
murrable. Green v. Green, 69-294 ; Righton v. Pruden, 73-61 ; Har
grove v. Tuck, 73-24.
An action by the "attorney general in the name of the people on the
relation of A," is not demurrable. Hargrove v. Tuck, 73-24.
Where an action was brought against three judgment debtors and the
administratrix of a fourth, on the judgment, and the heirs at laws of the
deceased judgment debtor were made parties, and the prayer for judg
ment was that execution issue against the three defendants who were
alive, and that the administratrix of the dead one proceed to sell his
land to make assets, the heirs were unnecessary parties, and the plain
tiff was not entitled to his prayer for judgment against the administra
trix to sell the land, but this was no ground of demurrer by one of the
other defendants. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
Statute of limitations.—The defence of the statute of limitations cannot
be taken by demurrer. Green v. Railroad, 73-524.
If objection not taken before the justice. —If an objection for want of
proper parties is not taken in a trial before the magistrate, it is waived,
and cannot be taken in the superior court on appeal.
If demurrer is overruled.—In a suit upon a contract made prior to the
C. C. P., if the defendant demur for want of parties, and the demurrer
is sustained in the superior court, and upon appeal to the supreme court
the demurrer is overruled, the plaintiff will be entitled to a final judgment
in the supreme court. Merwin v. Ballard, 65-168.
After a judgment overruling a demurrer as frivolous, the right to
answer over is not a matter of course, but depends upon the sound dis
cretion of the court. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
If a demurrer is overruled, the same point cannot be presented by a
motion to dismiss. Wilson v. Lineberger, 82-412.
Under the old system, upon the overruling of a demurrer, in an action
for goods sold and delivered, the judgment granted for the plaintiff was
only interlocutory, and his damages must be ascertained by the inquisi
tion of a jury. Merwin v. Ballard, 66-398.
Where a demurrer is overruled with leave to the defendant to answer
over, and to plaintiff to amend complaint, and on appeal the demurrer
is sustained, no final judgment will be entered in the supreme court, but
the case will be remanded for further proceedings. Morris v. Gentry,
89-248.
Waiver. —Where a defendant demurred because he had not been prop
erly served, but a general appearance was entered by his counsel, the
appearance waived any irregularity in the service, and the demurrer was
properly overruled. Penniman v. Daniel, 95-341.
Where it appears in the complaint that a cause of action is alleged,
although imperfectly and defectively, the defect is waived unless pointed
out by demurrer. Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59 I Johnson v. Finch, 93205.
See cases cited, \ 242, post.
" Speaking" demurrer not allowable. —A demurrer which, in order to sus
tain itself, invokes the aid of a fact not appearing in the complaint, must
be ovenuled. Von Glahn v. DeRossett, 76-292 ; Moore v. Hobbs, 77-65.
Demurrer admits allegations of fact, not legal conclusions.—In an action for
claim and delivery of a horse, where the answer alleges a lien upon it,
a demurrer to the answer does not admit the lien, but merely the facts
set out in the answer, denying their sufficiency in law. Mauney v.
Ingram, 78-96.
Complaint stating conclusions of law. —A complaint which states conclu
sions of law, and not the facts from which they are derived, is demurra
ble both at common law and under C. C. P. Moore v. Hobbs, 79-535.
Motion for judgment on complaint and answer. —It is irregular for the
plaintiff to move for judgment upon complaint and answer. If the alle
gations in the answer are admitted, thi; proper course is to demur. Bald
win v. York, 71-463.
Every demurrer is now a special demurrer.—A demurrer under The Code
differs from a demurrer at law, in that every demurrer, whether for sub
stance or form, is now a special demurrer, and must distinctly specify
the ground of objection to the complaint, or be disregarded as frivolous;
it differs from a demurrer in equity, in that the judgment overruling it
is final, and decides the case unless leave is obtained to put in an answer.
Love v. Commissioners, 64-706.
(1) That the court has 110 jurisdiction of the person of
the defendant, or of the subject of the action ; or
When jurisdiction can be conferred by consent. —Where there is a defect
of jurisdiction, it cannot be conferred by consent, but where the court
has general jurisdiction of the subject, and the lack of it in a particular
case depends upon some exceptional matter, objection must be taken
in limine. Hawkins v. Hughes, 87-115.
Defect of jurisdiction must appear by the complaint. —A demurrer for want
of jurisdiction can only be sustained when the defect appears on the
face of the complaint. Bank v. Britton, 66-365.
Defect of jurisdiction must be demurred to. —The want of jurisdiction is
not the subject of a "plea" at all. If it exist, it is ground for demur
rer. Flack v. Dawson, 69-42.
Where amendment of pleadings causes a defect of jurisdiction.—Where a
complaint which states matters properly triable in the probate court is
amended in the superior court on appeal by engrafting new matter cog
nizable only by the superior court in term, a demurrer averring want of
jurisdiction will be sustained. Capps v. Capps, 85-408. Compare
Cheatham v. Crews, 81-343; Vaughan v. Vincent, 88-116; Finch v.
Baskerville, 85-205; Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
Demurrer for defect of jurisdiction of the person. —A demurrer to the
jurisdiction of the superior court in an action to recover from an execu
tor the interest of a legatee, is bad when a part of the relief sought is
to enforce a trust created by contract on the part of his testator, and
not arising out of the official duty of the executor, or a constructive
trust arising out of his fraud. Oliver v. Wiley, 75-320.
Or, where the legacy has been assented to by the executor, and that
fact appears in the complaint. McFarland v McKay, 74-258.
In an action brought against a county for a debt due for building a
bridge, the defendants demurred on the ground that " mandamus is the
only form of action against a county." Rodman, J., delivering the
opinion, says : " Where a good cause of action exists, a municipal cor
poration may be sued in the usual form, and its liability does not differ,
as respects the form of action, from that of an individual. What will
be the effect of a judgment and how the same will be enforced, are not
questions affecting the form of action." Winslow v Commissioners,
64-218.
Demurrer for defect of jurisdiction of the subject-matter. —The superior
court has jurisdiction to declare a trust in real estate. Gulley v. Mace).,
81-356; Dula v. Young, 70-450.
A legatee may sue in the superior court the administrator of the exe
cutor of the will of her devisor, to have him declared a trustee of spe
cific funds in his hands for her benefit arising from the estate of his
intestate's testator, and requiring an account of the same. McFarland
v. McKay, 74-258.
An action for deceit and false warranty in the sale of a horse is cog
nizable by the superior court, though the damages claimed amount only
to fifty dollars. Ashe v. Gray, 88-190.
Where a special proceeding is transferred to the superior court on
issues raised by the pleadings and the answer is stricken out, the juris
diction of the superior court ceases, and it must issue a procedendo to
the probate court. Vaughan v. Vincent, 88-1 16.
An action to remove a cloud from title is demurrable if it appears that
the plaintiff is out of possession and can test his right by an action of eject
ment. The court has no jurisdiction of an equitable proceeding when
there is an adequate remedy at law. Pearson v. Boyden, 86-585 ; Busbee v. Macy, 85-329; Busbee v. Lewis, 85-332; Murray v. Hazel],
99-168 ; Peacock v. Slott 104-154.
The superior court has no jurisdiction when the complaint avers that
the defendant illegally exacted taxes of the plaintiff to the amount of
$150. but expressly waives the tort. Winslow v. Weith, 66-432.
A complaint which alleges that the plaintiff had theretofore obtained
a judgment against the defendant, the record of which had been
destroyed, is bad ; since the record is the judgment itself and no
action can be based on it until it is restored. Walton v. McKesson,
64-77.
When an executor assents to a legacy, it becomes a debt, and the
superior court has jurisdiction of it, as a promise to pay. Hodge v.
Hodge, 72-616.
The stay law, contained in the ordinance of June, 1866, and March,
1868, is unconstitutional and void, and the superior court has jurisdic
tion in the cases embraced by them, and may proceed at once, as in
other cases. Jacobs v. Smallwood, 63-112; Rives v. Williams, 63-128;
Holt v. Iseley, 63-129; Swepson v. Chapman, 63-130.
Where the sum demanded in good faith exceeds $200, the superior
court has jurisdiction. Usry v. Suit, 91-406.
The Code has not taken away from the superior court any jurisdic
tion heretofore exercised by courts of equity, except, perhaps, in cases
exclusively w ithin the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. Williams
v. Bynum, 92-717.
A former proceeding in bastardy, which was dismissed for want of
jurisdiction, is no bar to a second proceeding based upon the same
charge. State v. Giles, 103-391
Jurisdiction of justice. —A justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of
an equitable action. Hunter v. Yarborough, 92-68 ; Doroughty v.
Sprinkle, 88-300.
Where a single contract is made for furnishing several articles, the
plaintiff cannot "split up" the account and recover for each of them
separately. When this is attempted, the superior court would not acquire
jurisdiction by consolidating the cases into one. The appellate jurisdic
tion is derived solely from a rightful one assumed below. Jarrett v. Self,
90-478.
....
A justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of an action by a lessee
against his lessor for dispossessing him, when the damages demanded
exceed fifty dollars. Barneycastle v. Walker, 92-198.
(2) That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue; or
Capacity to sue. —Where lands are devised to A, with remainder to her
children, conditioned that she has any to live to be twenty-one years old,
and, upon failure thereof, to B, B has a sufficient interest to sustain a
suit against A to restrain waste, when A has been married twelve years,
and has arrived at the age of fifty-two years without having given birth
to a child. Gordon v. Lowther, 75-193.
A party injured by a false return of a sheriff may sue in his own name
to recover the statutory penalty for making such false return, although
the action in which the false return was made was brought in the name
of the state to the use of such party. Peebles v. Newsom, 74-473.
Where purchase-money has been paid upon an agreement for the sale
of land, if the contract is vacated after the death of the vendee, his heir
at law has legal capacity to sue for the recovery of the money. Young
v. Young, 81-91; Tate v. Connor, 17-224.
(3) That there is another action pending between the
same parties for the same cause; or
The former action must be between the Bame parties.—The pendency of a
former to abate a later suit must be between the same parties and for the
same cause of action. Harris v. Johnson, 65-478; Woody v. Jordan,
69-189; Sloan v. McDowell, 75-29; Pendleton v. Davis, 92-185.
In order to support the defence of another action pending, the two
actions must be between the same parties. So, where the defendant in
one suit is the plaintiff in another, in both of which actions the title to
the same trade-mark is brought in question, the plea of another action
pending will not avail him in an action by the assignee of the defendant
in the first suit in regard to the title of the same trade-mark. Tobacco
Co. v. McElwee, 94-425.
The former action must be pending in a state court.—The action pending,
in order to constitute a ground of demurrer, must be one pending in
some court of this state. Sloan v. McDowell, 75-29.
The pendency of former action must be specifically set np. —The court will
not take notice of the pendency of another action unless it appear of
record by plea, answer or demurrer. Smith v. Moore, 79-82.
The pendency of a former action or a former judgment is strietly a
matter of abatement, and must be set up in the answer or in some way
insisted upon before a trial on the merits, or it is waived. Hawkins v.
Hughes, 87-115; Blackwell v. Dibbrell, 103-270; Harrison v. Hoff, 102126; Hawkins v. Hughes, 104-161.
The pendency of a former action between the same parties for the
same cause is a good defence in a second action, to be taken advantage
of by demurrer if it appear in the complaint, and by answer if it do not.
Harris v. Johnson, 65-478.
Before a justice of the peace. —Where a summons before a justice was not
served, and on its return day another summons for the same cause of
action was issued by another justice, the first action terminated when
the second one began, and cannot be pleaded as a defence under this
section. Webster v. Laws, 86-178.
NOTE. —A demurrer setting up the pendency of a former action being
overruled, the defendant was allowed to answer over, "upon the liberal
procedure adopted by the C. C. P.," in Glenn v. Bank, 72-626.
(4) That there is a defect of parties plaintiff or defend
ant; or
Misjoinder of unnecessary parties. —The misjoinder of unnecessary parties
is a mere matter of surplusage, under The Code, and not a fatal objec
tion. The failure to join necessary parties only is a ground of demurrer
for "defect of parties." Green v. Green, 69-294; Rowland v. Gardner,
69-53; Rightort v. Pruden, 73-61; Hoover v. Berryhill, 84-182.
Objection must be taken by demurrer. —The objection that there is a defect
of parties plaintiff can only be taken by demurrer. Davidson v. Elms,
67-228.
In an action of trespass, commenced before the adoption of The Code,
and tried afterwards, the defendant, not having demurred for a non-join
der of necessary parties, cannot raise the question afterward under the
general issue. Lewis v. McNatt, 65-63.
A defect of parties apparent on the face of the complaint must be
taken advantage of by demurrer; when it is not so apparent, it should
be averred in the answer; and if it is not presented in one or the other
of these methods, it will be deemed to have been waived. The Code,
$\ 239, 241, 242; Usry v. Suit, 91-406; Silver Valley Co. v. Baltimore Co.,
99-445; Leak v. Covington, 99-559; Lunn v. Shermer, 93-164; Kornegay
v. Steamboat Co., 107-115.
Failure to join a necessary party. —The failure to join as a plaintiff or
defendant one who is a necessary party to a complete determination and
settlement of the question involved in the action is ground for a demur
rer. Gill v. Young, 82-273.
Not necessary party. —The wife is not a necessary party to an action
brought by her husband, who is tenant by the courtesy initiate, to
recover her lands. Wilson v. Arentz, 70-670.
A guardian who lends the funds in his hands to a firm, of which he is
a member, taking their note payable to himself, and afterwards assigns
such note to the husband of his ward in settlement of her interest, is not
a necessary party to a suit brought to recover on said note. Gudger v.
Baird, 66-438.
Where the parties are very numerous. —Where it is averred in the com
plaint that the defendants, and others unknown to plaintiffs, are stock
holders in a corporation, and are so numerous that it is impracticable to
bring them all before the court, a demurrer for defect of parties will not
be sustained. Bronson v. Insurance Co., 85-411.
In an action against a bank to recover on bills issued as currency, it
is not necessary to make all the holders of such bills plaintiffs, though
they may come in, the action being in the nature of a creditor's bill, and
share the recovery. Wilson v. Bank, 72-621.
When, in such action, relief is demanded against the stockholders
also, they, being represented by the bank, need not be made parties
defendant. Ibid.
An action is well brought on such bills against (1) the bank which
issued them, (2) a bank which agreed to redeem them, and (3) against a
Eerson who covenanted that they should be redeemed, and the stockolders held harmless, all of them being necessary parties to a complete
determination of the controversy. Ibid.
Where the charter of a bank provides that the stockholders, in case
of its insolvency, shall each be liable in double the amount of their
individual stock to the creditors of said bank, the creditors of the bank
are joint obligees and cannot sue separately, but they must all be plain
tiffs in an action to enforce such liability, and, as they are presumably
many in number and may be unknown, one may be allowed to sue in his
own name in behalf of all, according to the rule in courts of equity.
Von Glahn v. Harris, 73-323; Von Glahu v. Savage, 73-333.
So, too, the stockholders are joint obligors and not several, and must
be proceeded against jointly by all the creditors, or one of the creditors
may sue in behalf of himself and all the others, all the stockholders
who may all defend, or one may defend for himself and all the others.
Ibid.
Action on bond of a deceased administrator. —An action on the bond of a
deceased administrator cannot be brought on the relation of the next of
kin of his intestate before appointment of an administrator de bonis non.
Goodman v. Goodman, 72-508.
Action by nezt of kin.—Where the next of kin sued the administrator
in the probate court and obtained judgment for the amounts severally
due them, an action by one of them (without joining the others) against
the administration bond to enforce his judgment is not demurrable for
defect of parties. Hoover v. Berryhill, 84-132.
Grantees of different fraudulent conveyances.—Where alleged fraudulent
conveyances are made to several grantees, they are all necessary and
proper parties to a proceeding to set them aside instituted by an impeach
ing creditor of the grantor. Bank v. Harris, 84-206.
Action upon joint obligation. —In an action brought after the adoption of
The Code, for the value of goods sold and delivered in i860, it was held
that the rule of the Revised Code, $84, ch. 31, in regard to the joinder
of parties defendant in cases of joint obligations, prevailed, and that a
demurrer would not lie for failure to unite them all in the action. Mervfin v. Ballard, 65-168.
Party plaintiff in interest made a co-defendant. —In a proceeding by the
next of kin against the administrator for a settlement, it is not ground
for demurrer that the defendant's wife, who is one of the next of kin, is
made a co-defendant with him without alleging in the complaint that
she had refused to join as plaintiff. McCormac v. Wiggins, 84-278.
Trustee can sue without joining the cestui que trust. —When a bond was
made payable to A and B, and assigned "Pay to C, trustee for A aud B,"
the trustee can sue in his own name and without joining his cesluis que
trust. Davidson v. Elms, 67-228.
Sheriff proper party to action. —A sheriff is a proper party to an action,
to recover possession of land sold by him under execution, when it is
alleged that the deed given by him has been lost and the execution of a
new one is sought. McMillan v. Edwards, 75-81.
State need not be joined. —A party injured by a false return of a sheriff
may sue in his own name for the penalty without joining the state or
making himself relator. Peebles v. Newsom, 74-473.
Actions of quo warranto. —An action in the nature of a quo warranto, for
an office, entitled "T. L. Hargrove, attorney general, in the name of the
people of said state and on the relation of N. N. Tuck, plaintiff, v.," is
well brought, and a demurrer for defect of parties will not lie. People
v. Hunt, 73-24.
An action to try the title to an office may be brought by the attorney
general on his own information without joining another claimant as a
relator. People v. Hilliard, 72-169.
Mortgagor and mortgagee. —Where a mortgagor, under a mortgage con
taining a power of sale, denied his indebtedness to the mortgagee, and
conveyed the land to a third party under an agreement that he should
bid it in at the sale and hold it as security for the amount paid, after the
sale brought suit against the mortgagee for an account and settlement,
and made the said third party a defendant, it is not a demurrable mis
joinder. Buie v. Building and Loan Association, 74-117.
In an action by the debtor to enjoin a judgment creditor from selling
property on which there are mortgages, the mortgagees are necessary
parties. Gaster v. Hardie, 75-460.
Action to compel a trustee to collect a bond. —In an action arising out of
the fraudulent conduct of a trustee in failing to collect a bond given for
the benefit of certain parties named therein, to compel him to collect the
same, both the beneficiaries and the personal representatives of the
obligors in said bond are necessary parties and must be made plaintiffs
or defendants. Oliver v. Wiley, 75-320.
(5) That several causes of action have been improperly
united; or
Waived, if not demurred to.—An objection to the joinder of the different
causes of action must be taken by demurrer; otherwise the objection is
waived. Finley v. Hayes, 81-368.
Objection cannot be taken by motion. —The objection that causes of action
have been improperly united must be taken by demurrer, and cannot be
raised by motion. McMillan v. Edwards, 75-81.
By answer, if the objection does not appear on the face of the complaint. —A
misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is a ground of demurrer, or
it can be taken advantage of by answer, when the demurrable matter
does not appear on the face of the complaint. Burns v. Ash worth, 72-496.
Union of different breaches of an administration bond in one action. —In an
action against an administration bond, different breaches may be set up
by different parties uniting in the same action. Hoover v. Berryhill,
84-132. «. ■ .
Suit upon two official bonds in one action.— Nor is a complaint demurrable
because the action is brought upon two official bonds (given by the same
officer) against the principal, and such of the sureties as are common to
both bonds. Syme v. Bunting, 86-175.
Injuries caused by separate action of several persons. —Where an injury is
caused by the separate action of several persons whose interests are ad
verse to the plaintiffs, they may all be joined as defendants in an action
for damages, resulting from such acts. Long v. Swindell, 77-176.
Joinder of a guarantor with the maker and endorser of a note.—A party,
who writes his name across the back of a note after judgment has been
obtained against both the maker and endorser, if he makes any contract at
all with the endorsee, becomes a guarantor, and a cause of action against
him, as such, cannot be joined with one against the maker and endorser.
Wooten v. Maultsby, 69-462.
Action against one who was both guardian and administrator of an infant.—
A complaint in an action against a defendant who was both guardian
and administrator of an infant in his double capacity is not demurrable
for misjoinder of causes of action. Alexander v. Wolfe, 83-272.
Action against guardian upon his bond. —An action against a former guar
dian upon his bond, which alleges a failure to account for funds received,
and also a fraudulent combination to dispose of the real estate of his
ward, is not a misjoinder, since both liabilities arise out of the same
transaction, to-wit, the guardianship. Adams v. Quinn, 74-359.
Foreclosure of mortgage and ejectment. —An action to foreclose a mort
gage on one tract of land cannot be united with a cause of action to
recover possession of another tract, in the same complaint. Edgerton
v. Powell, 72-64.
Demands for several reliefs. —A complaint asking (1) that a decree be set
aside for fraud ; (2) to annul deeds executed to purchasers by a commis
sioner appointed under the decree to sell lands ; (3) to recover possession
of the lands and the rents and profits thereof; (4) for an injunction; is
not demurrable. It is substantially one cause of action for which several
reliefs are asked. England v. Garner, 86-366; Young v. Young, 81-91.
A complaint is not demurrable for joining a cause of action upon a
debt, and to declare void conveyances made by the debtor in fraud of
the complaining creditor., Bank v. Harris, 84-206.
Joint suit by several creditors to subject property of their common debtor.—
Where creditors affected by the fraud of a common debtor in the conveyance of his property join in one action to subject the same to the pay
ment of theii debts, a demurrer that several causes of action have been
improperly joined will not be sustained. Mebaue v. Layton, 86-571.
Joining demand for rents with petition for partition. —An application for a
partition of lauds joined with a demand for rents and profits converted
by certain of the tenants in common is not a joinder of a demand in tort
with one on contract nor demurrable. Finch v. Baskerville, 85-205.
In partition. —A proceeding in partition which asks a division of sev
eral separate and distinct tracts of land, not held by the same tenants
in common, is multifarious. Simpson v. Wallace, 83-477.
Joining action for tort and for false warranty. —Complaint for a tort, to
which is annexed a cause of action for a false warranty, is not demur
rable for a misjoinder of causes of action. Ashe v. Gray, 88-190.
Where the complaint contains two causes of action, one for deceit in
the sale of a horse, and the other for a breach of warranty, in each the
damages claimed being laid at less than one hundred and fifty dollars,
and there was a verdict against the plaintiff on the first, but for him on
the second, assessing damages at sixty-five dollars, the superior court had
What causes of action may not be joined.—Causes of action, belonging
to any one of the classes.mentioned iq ^ 267, may be united in one com
plaint, but no two JJjIehging to diffejeat classes; so that a complaint
which alleges a cattse of action arislnir upon contract with a cause of
action in tort is defective. North CajDliria Land Co. v. Beatty, 69-329 ;
Chamberlain v. Robertson, 52-12; Logan v. Wallis, 76-416; Doughty v.
Railroad, 78-22 ; Hodges v. Railroad^ 105-170. In such cases the action
should not be dismissed, but diviHed. Street v. Tuck, 84-605 ; Finch v.
Baskerville, 85-205.
There is a great difference between the joinder of incongruous causes
of action, over each of which the court has jurisdiction, and the associa
tion of separate alleged causes of action of which some are within and
others without the jurisdiction of the court. In the latter case the alle
gations of causes of action of which the court has no jurisdiction are
but harmless surplusage. Therefore, where plaintiff sued a railroad com
pany in the superior court for the value of his land appropriated as a
right-of-way by the company, and joined a cause of action for damages
sustained by him by reason of the faulty construction of the road :
Held, that he could recover on the last mentioned cause of action,
although the court had no jurisdiction of the first. Allen v. Railroad,
102-381.
See cases cited under \\ 267 and 272, post.
(6) That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action;
General demurrer. —A general demurrer will be disregarded. Love v.
Commissioners, 64-706 ; George v. High, 85-99 ; Bank v. Bogle, 85-203;
Jones v. Commissioners, 85-278.
Objection taken by motion in the supreme court. —Objection to a complaint
that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action may
be taken by motion in the supreme court. Tucker v. Baker, 86-1 ; Jack
son v. Jackson, 105-433; Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59.
Where it is apparent from the allegations' in the complaint that the
plaintiff has no cause of action, a motion to dismiss at any stage of the
action will prevail ; but where the complaint fails to set forth a sufficient 
cause of action by reason of the omissitfh of some substantial averment,
or for any other defect which might be remedied by amendment, the
objection must be made by demurrer or answer, or the defendant will be
deemed to have waived it. Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59 ! Johnson v.
Finch, 93-205.
If complaint is good as to any one defendant. —Where all the defendants
join in a demurrer to the complaint, upon the ground that it does not
set forth a good cause of action, the demurrer will be overruled if the
complaint sets forth a good cause of action as to any one of the defend
ants. Conant v. Barnard, 103-315.
^
Motion to dismiss in the superior court. —Where a demurrer that the com
plaint does not state a cause ^F^plon is overruled, the same point can
not be again presented by a motion to dismiss. Wilson v. Lineberger,
82-412: contra, Baker v. Garris, 108-218.
To dismiss plaintiff's action after answer filed by the defendant on the
ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action is contrary to the course of the courts. Such objection
must be taken by demurrer. Wilson v. Sykes, 84-215.
Overruling demurrer on this ground not an estoppel. —A judgment overrul
ing a demurrer to a complaint for that it did not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, and allowing defendant to plead, being
simply an interlocutory order, is not an estoppel upon defendant to set
up the same matter in some other subsequent proper method. Wilson v.
Lineberger, 82-412 ; distinguished, Baker v. Garris, 108-218.
Frivolous demurrer.— A demurrer to the complaint in an action for the
recovery of land on the ground, (1) failure of plaintiff to set forth his
title ; (2) to allege an ouster by defendant ; or (3) to aver a demand for
possession and damages before action brought ; or (4) to allege a notice
to quit before suit brought ; or (5) to assert a possession in the plaintiff
and those under whom he claims within twenty years before action
brought is frivolous. Johnston v. Pate, 83-110.
A demurrer to a complaint in an action by an executor because it does
not allege that the probate of will and qualification was before suit
brought is frivolous, when it is alleged in the complaint that it was before
complaintfiled. Hurst v. Addington, 84-143.
No obligee named in a bond.—Where an obligor by a bond pledged him
self to be responsible for the payment of a note, naming the payer and
payee thereof, a demurrer that no obligee was named in the bond was
overruled. Leach v. Fleming, 85-447.
Complaint stating conclusions of law. —A complaint stating merely con
clusions of law, and not the facts from which they are drawn, is demur
rable. Moore v. Hobbs, 79-535 ; Boyden v. Achenbach, 79-539.
Complaints stating sufficient cause of action. —A complaint which alleges
that in 1863 the judge of the superior court for the county where plain
tiff's testator resided made a violent charge to the grand jury in regard
to receiving Confederate money for debts, threatening to imprison any
who refused to r*o so, and upon motion of a judgment debtor of plain
tiff's testator, allowed him to have satisfaction of the judgment entered
by paying into court the amount in Confederate money, and sent word
to plaintiff's intestate that if he did not receive the Confederate money
and make the deed he would have him sent to Richmond, and that his
intestate being old and infirm, and in great fear, received the money
and made the deed : Held, 011 demurrer, to set forth a good cause of
action against the purchaser of the land. Harshaw v. Dobson, 64-384.
A will giving "unto my wife Lovey the use and benefit of all my estate,
real and personal, during her life," and also empowering her "to lay
out all the surplus funds, consisting of notes and cash, in land for her
especial use and benefit during her natural life, and, after her death, to
be given to my niece Mary Jane; also a county claim of the following
amount, $2, 573.21, to be appropriated as above," gives a remainder in
the "surplus funds" to Mary Jane, whether they were invested in lands
or not, and a complaint, setting forth the facts, in an action brought by
the niece, after the death of the widow, is good. Charles v. Kennedy,
64-442.
Where a guardian lent trust funds to a firm of which he was a mem
ber, and took their note payable to himself, though he could not under
the old system sue upon it at law, an action may now be maintained on
it by the husband of the ward to whom it has been assigned. Gudger
v. Baird, 66-438.
In an action for damages for trespass on real property, it is not neces
sary to describe the premises by metes and bounds to constitute a cause
of action. Whitaker v. Forbes, 68-228.
The vendee of goods contracted to be delivered at a certain time and
of a specific quality, may recover for any defect in quality, although he
may have received and used the goods, if he did not discover that they
were of inferior quality in time to return them without prejudice to
himself. Cox v. Long, 69-7 ; Howie v. Rea, 70-559.
A complaint by a husband, which states that he was married to his wife
in 184 1, has had several living children by her, and that she acquired
land by deed in 1864, is sufficient to show him to be tenant by the
courtesy initiate, and, he may recover the possession by action in his
own name, though he cannot lease without the consent of the wife.
Wilson v. Arentz, 70-670.
In an action to recover cotton claimed as rent, the allegation of a con
tract between A and B, by which A was to cultivate all the land hecould
with one horse, and pay B as rent two bales of cotton—no part of the
crop to belong to A until the rent was paid—constitutes A a cropper and
not a tenant, and entitles B to recover possession of the crop from him.
Haywood v. Rogers, 73-320.
A complaint alleging that the defendant was the guardian of the
plaintiff, has never settled with him, and while such guardian fraudu
lently contrived to convey away the plaintiff's lands, states a good cause
of action for an account and settlement, although it also appears on its
face that the defendant has been removed from the guardianship. Adams
v. Quinn, 74-359.
That the administrator of an executor has funds in his hands belong
ing to the estate of his intestate's testator, is a good cause of action in
a suit brought by a legatee to have him declared a trustee for her benefit.
McFarland v. McKay, 74-258.
In an action against the sheriff for a penalty for making a false return,
it is not necess iry that it should be alleged to have been "wilfully,"
"fraudulently " or "intentionally" false. The fact that it alleges the
return to be false is sufficient. Peebles v. Newsom, 74-473.
Where lands are devised to a daughter A for life and to her children,
should she have any to live to become twenty-one years old, and on
failure of children to arrive at that age, then to B, a grandson of testator,
a complaint setting forth that A is fifty-two years of age, has been mar
ried twelve years and had no child, and is in possession of the lands,
committing and threatening waste thereon, is a good complaint in an
action by B to restrain further waste. Gordon v. Lowther, 75-193.
A complaint alleging that the plaintiff waived his right to a home
stead by parol and surrendered possession to a purchaser for value and
without notice, shows that he still has a right of homestead, but the
same not having been laid off by metes and bounds, the court cannot
grant a writ of possession. Littlejohn v. Egerton, 76-468.
In an action to foreclose a mortgage, made by husband and wife, to
secure a note of the wife given for a debt of the husband, though the
note was not made with the written consent of the husband, a demur
rer that the complaint does not state a cause of action against the wife,
is not good. Newhart v. Peters, 80-167.
A complaint in an action by a- creditor to declare void conveyances
made by the debtor in fraud of ffie complaining cr^itor is not demur
rable for failure to allege that the debtor has not "ther property suffi
cient to satisfy the claim. Bank v. Harris, 84^206.
In an action by an administrator against the distributees upon their
refunding bonds, the complaint is not demurrable for failing to set forth
an account of the administration. Lowery v. Perry, 85-131.
Where a complaint alleges that a judgment debtor demanded his per
sonal property exemptions in apt time, but that the sheriff failed and
refused to allot it to him, and afterwards sold the property and applied
the money to executions in his hands, it sufficiently alleges a breach of
the bond, and a motion to dismiss because the complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action was properly refused.
Scott v. Kenan, 94-266.
Where the complaint set forth the whole number of votes cast at an
election, and alleged that the relator received a specific number of
those votes—being a majority—and "was duly elected," a demurrer to
the complaint, upon the ground that it did not sufficiently allege that
the relator received a majority of the said votes, was bad. Hancock v.
Hobbs, 98-589.
Where the complaint alleged that the relator was duly elected by a
majority over the defendant, a demurrer, for that the complaint did not
allege that he received a majority of the "legal votes cast," is bad.
Hahn v. Stinson, 98-591.
While the general rule is, one partner cannot maintain an action
against his copartner to recover money which might have been taken
into account of the partnership, until after a settlement, he may sue
before such settlement to recover for the wrongful conversion or destruc
tion of the joint property, or for the loss or destruction of his individ
ual property used in the business—resulting from the negligent use by
the other partner. Newby v. Harrell, 99-149.
The obligors in an official bond made payable, in terms, to the person
for whose benefit it is required, cannot, when sued for a breach thereof,
be heard to say that it cannot be enforced because not executed to the
state. Warrenton v. Arrin^ton, 101-109.
An averment in a complaint that the plaintiff sold and delivered to
the defendant goods of certain value, and the same has not been paid,
is a sufficient statement of a cause of action. Smith v. Summerfield,
108-284.
Complaints not stating a sufficient canse of action. —A complaint in an
action against a county, which does not allege that the claim of the
plaintiff was presented to the board of commissioners and either allowed
by them, or an audit refused, and, if allowed, that it was presented to the
county treasurer and payment refused, does not state a sufficient cause
of action. Love v. Commissioners, 64-706 ; Jones v. Commissioners,
73-182.
A complaint setting forth as a cause of action the fact that an irregu
lar judgment has been granted against the plaintiff and in favor of the
defendant, and execution issued thereon, in another action, is demur
rable. The proper remedy is by motion to set aside the judgment in
the original cause. Foard v. Alexander, 64-69.
Where it appears by the complaint that the county court in 1863 gave
the note sued on to obtain money to buy salt for the inhabitants of the
county, which article had become very scarce on account of a stringent
blockade, such note is void as being given in aid of the rebellion, and a
demurrer to the complaint should be sustained. Leak v. Commission
ers. 64-132.
When it is provided by statute that certain powers might be exercised
by the county courts, a majority of the justices being present, in setting
up a right resulting from such action, it is necessary to allege the
presence of such majority, in order to constitute a cause of action.
Ibid.
The allegations that A contracted to sell a certain tract of land to B,
who paid a part of the purchase-money, entered upon the land and then
sold to C—the land being afterwards sold under execution against A,
and purchased by D—do not constitute a sufficient cause of action in
fdvor of D, seeking to be subrogated to the rights of A in the contract
of sale ; since no equity can be sold at execution unless it be such as
draws to it the legal estate, which it cannot do when other equities have
attached. Tally v. Reid, 72-336.
When the complaint showed that the father of certain of the defend
ants had conveyed the lands sued for in fraud, during his life time, and
said defendants were not in possession, and were not alleged to have
made any claim thereto, held, on demurrer, that it stated no cause of
action as to them. Wall v. Fairley, 73-464.
A complaint against a sheriff and his bondsmen for a failure to col
lect the taxes due upon a list, which came into his hands previous to
the execution of such bond and during a prior term of office, as sheriff,
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Coffield
v. McNeill, 74-535.
A complaint alleged that the agent of the defendant agreed to insure
the life of the plaintiff's intestate for six months, for the sum of fifty
dollars ; that the said intestate paid to said agent the sum of forty-five
dollars on said agreement. No written application was made and no
policy issued. The balance of the fifty dollars was not alleged to have
been paid and no reason assigned why it was not, held, on demurrer,
not a sufficient cause of action. Barnes v. Piedmont Insurance Co.,
74-22.
Lands devised to A, B and C for life, and at their death to their chil
dren, in fee ; held that A and B, having died without issue, C has a life
estate in the entire tract, and the heirs of the devisor have no right to
partition during his life. Powell v. Allen, 75-450.
The claim of the University, under chapter 236 of the laws of 1874-'75,
to "all dividends of corporations not recovered or claimed by suit by
the parties entitled thereto, within five years from the time they are
declared," is unconstitutional and a complaint based on it is demurra
ble. University v. Rai1road, 76-103.
If an executor, after the lapse of a sufficient time for settling the
estate of his testator, voluntarily delivers possession of the property of
his testator to a legatee, he is presumed to have assented to the legacy
and must allege special circumstances to prove that he was in no default,
to recover it back. In such case, where such circumstances do not
appear in the complaint, held, on demurrer, not a sufficient cause of
action. Bumpass v. Chambers, 77-357.
An action by devisees and legatees, for a settlement of the estate
against the children, and next of kin, and heirs at law of the deceased,
(the executor being dead,) is demurrable. Netherton v. Candler, 78-88.
A complaint in an action by a board of commissioners, upon the offi
cial bond of a tax-collector, is demurrable, if it fail to set forth directly
(not merely as recital) that the treasurer improperly neglects or refuses
to sue. Commissioners v. McPherson, 79-524.
In an action upon a contract, an answer of the defendant which alleges
that the execution of the contract was induced by the false representa
tion of the plaintiff, but does not allege that he was thereby deceived, is
demurrable. Foy v. Haughton, 83-467.
In an action brought against a trading firm to recover a debt in which
it was sought, among other remedies, to subject the individual real estate
of one of the firm, a woman, to the satisfaction of the judgment; the
complaint did not allege that the said real property was any part of the
assets of the firm, nor that the woman was married, nor that she had con
veyed the lands fraudulently : Held, (1) that the complaint failed to dis
close such a cause of action as authorized a sale of the land and a dis
tribution of the proceeds among creditors ; (2) that a prior mortgagee of
the woman was not a necessary party, and the action as to him was prop
erly dismissed. Claflin v. Harrison, 108-157.
A complaint alleging that G., wife of the defendant (her executor),
executed, for a valuable consideration, her note, under seal, to the plain
tiff, and that no part thereof had been paid, but containing no allega
tion that the contract was one she was competent to make, or any cir
cumstances showing the indebtedness was chargeable upon her separate
estate, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
Baker v. Garris, 108-218.
Sec. 240. Demurrer must specify grounds of objection.
C. C. 1'., s. 90.
The demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds of
objection to the complaint. Unless it does so, it may be
disregarded. It may be taken to the whole complaint, or
to any of the alleged causes of action stated therein.
The demurrer must be special. —A general demurrer that "the complaint
does not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action," should
be overruled, or, rather, disregarded. Every demurrer which does not
distinctly specify the ground of objection must be disregarded. Love
v. Com'rs, 64-706 ; George v. High, 85-99 ; Bank v. Bogle, 85-203 ; Jones
v. Com'rs, 83-278.
But such an objection can be taken ore tenus in the supreme court.
Tucker v. Baker, 86-1.
A demurrer that " the complaint states no cause of action whatever "
against the defendant, will be disregarded. It must distinctly specify the
grounds of objection to the complaint. Foss v. Waller, 90-149.
A demurrer that the court did not have jurisdiction, is defective in
not stating the ground, but such demurrer can be renewed ore tenus in
the supreme court. Hunter v. Yarboro, 92-68.
A demurrer that the court has not jurisdiction, and that the complaint
does not state a cause of action, will be disregarded as a pleading, but
will be treated as a motion to dismiss. Burbank v. Com'rs, 92-257.
Where there is only one canse of action. —When there is but one cause of
action, or but one defence, a demurrer must cover the whole ground, or
it will be a nullity. State v. Young, 65-579 '1 Cowand v. Meyers, 99-198. 
Where there are several causes of action. —A defendant may answer to
some of the causes of action in the complaint and demur to others, but
he cannot answer certain allegations and demur to others, in the same
cause of action or defence. Ransom v. McClees, 64-17 ; Speight v. Jen
kins, 99-143A demurrer may be to a new cause of action introduced by an amend
ment and without alleging a misjoinder. Finch v. Baskerville, 85-205.
Argumentative pleading. —Argumentative pleading is demurrable ; the
error, however, should be distinctly pointed out. Crump v. Mims, 64767.
Defective statement of a cause of action. —Where there is a defective state
ment of a cause of action, objection must be taken in apt time. It is
too late after an answer is filed. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430 ; Knowles v.
Railroad, 102-59.
The judge not required to specify ground for overruling a demurrer. —A
judge is not required to specify the ground of his ruling upon a demurrer
where several causes are assigned, though it would be more convenient
for him to do so. Johnston v. Smith, 86-498.
Sec. 241. Objection not appearing on complaint. C. C. P.,
s. 98.
When any of the matters enumerated as grounds of
demurrer do not appear on the face of the complaint, the
objection may be taken by answer.
If no demurrer, ohjection must be by answer. —If the ground of objection
to the complaint does not appear upou its face, it can only be taken
advantage of by answer. Moore v. Hobbs, 77-65.
In an action of trespass vi et artnis begun before the adoption of The
Code and tried afterwards, the defendant not having availed himself of
objection to the non-joinder of a plaintiff by demurrer under § 239, ante,
or by answer under this section of The Code, cannot do so under the
plea of the general issue. Lewis v. McNatt, 65-63.
Misjoinder. —In an action to recover land the objection for a misjoinder
of causes of action "in that two tracts which did not adjoin were em
braced in the same cause of action," must be taken advantage of by
demurrer, if it appear on the face of the complaint, and if not, by answer,
and cannot be raised by a motion to submit an issue to the jury. Dur
ham v. Bostwick, 72-353.
After the defendant had answered and the case had come on for trial,
he moved to dismiss for misjoinder of causes of action. The court says:
" As the defendant did not take the objection by answer or demurrer, but
answered over to the merits of the action, to tolerate the motion would
be to allow the violation of the best principles of good pleading. It was
too late to demur, and there is no rule which allows this objection to be
taken by motion, at any stage of the action." Burns v. Ashworth, 72-496.
See \ 239 (5), ante.
Defect of parties. —When the relations of one not a party to an action,
who, it is claimed, should have been made a party, appear in the com
plaint, the defendant has his remedy by demurrer ; and if they do not
so appear, he should set out the facts and insist on the objection in
his answer. Leak v. Covington, 99-559.

Where there is a defect of parties, and this appears from the com
plaint, objection should be taken by demurrer : otherwise, in the answer.
Usry v. Suit, 91-406 ; Silver Co. v. Bait. Co., 99-445 ; Kornegay v. Steam
boat Co., 107-115.
See \ 239 (4), ante.
Coverture.—Where the fact of coverture does not appear in the com
plaint, it must be pleaded to be made available as a defence. Baker v.
Garris, 108-218.
No averment of corporate capacity. —In a suit against a corporation, it
may be designated as a company by its corporate name without aver
ment of its corporate capacity, and if this is disputed, it should be by
answer and not by demurrer. Stanly v. Railroad, 89-331.
Sec. 242. Objection, when deemed waived. C. C. I'., s. 99.
If no such objection be taken, either by demurrer or
answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived the
same, excepting only the objection to the jurisdiction of
the court, and the objection that the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
See Lewis v. McNatt, 65-63 ; Burns v. Ashworth, 72-496, and Durham
v. Bostwick, 72-353, cited under preceding section.
An answer waives a demurrer. —If a defendant answers and demurs to
the same cause of action at the same time, the answer waives the ground
of demurrer. Ramsom v. McClees, 64-17.
Waiver. —The pendency of a former action, unless set up by answer
or otherwise before trial, is waived. Hawkins v. Hughes, 87-115.
The objection that there is a misjoinder of causes of action must be
taken by demurrer, or it is deemed to have been waived. Durham v.
Bostwick, 72-353 ; Burns v. Ashworth, 72-496.
In an action where the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint
because the court had no jurisdiction, Bynum, J., says : " By the present
system of pleading the objection to the jurisdiction can now be taken
only by answer or demurrer, the demurrer being either written or ore
ten us." Pescud v. Hawkins, 71-299.
While the proceedings may be irregular or erroneous, yet if no objec
tion is made to it on that particular ground, the judgment will be sus
tained. Brooks v. Brooks, 97-136.
Defective statement of cause of action. —A defective statement of a cause
of action is ground for demurrer (when the court may allow or require
an amendment), but not for a dismissal of the action. Bowling v. Bur
ton, 101-176.
Objection to a defective statement of a cause of action must be taken
advantage of by demurrer, or will be deemed to be waived, while a
statement of a defective cause of action may be taken advantage of at
any time by motion to dismiss. Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59 ! Halstead
v. Mullen, 93-252.
Not waived. —Whenever it shall appear to the court that a cause of
action is not stated in the complaint, the action should be dismissed.
McDougald v. Graham, 75-310.
A defence not pleaded in apt time is not waived if the complaint is so
defective that no judgment can be given on it. Pearce v. Mason, 78-37.
The objection that the complaint does not constitute a cause of action,
may be made by writen demurrer, or ore tenus, at any time, and cannot
be waived. Rogers v. Jenkins, 98-129; Johnson v. Finch, 93-205.
Neither consent nor waiver can confer jurisdiction, and the court will
not proceed, when it appears from the record that it has no authority.
State v. Miller, 100-543.
Motion in arrest of judgment. —If no demurrer is filed, when the com
plaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the
objection can still be raised by a motion in arrest of judgment. Love v.
Com'rs, 64-706.
Objection can be taken ore tenus in the supreme court. —The objection that
the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
may be taken by a motion to dismiss in the supreme court. Tucker v.
Baker, 86-1; Bryant v. Fisher, 85-71. See Rules Supreme Court, No. 27,
post.
And this is true, though a general demurrer on that ground would be
properly overruled by the court below. Jones v. Com'rs, 85-278.
Aider, express or implied. —When, in an action to recover land, the com
plaint did not state that the premises in controversy were wrongfully
withheld, and the defendant did not demur nor raise the question by
answer, but answered generally, claiming a right to hold the land : Held,
that the doctrine of aider by admission, express or implied, is an essen
tial element of every system of pleading, and that the claim of title in
the answer waived the defect in the complaint. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430.
In some cases, a defective statement of a cause of action, may be
aided by the admissions in the answer. Willis v. Branch, 94-142.
A defective statement of a cause of action is aided if the defendant
answers to the merit, and go to trial before pointing out the defect.

is not supplied by pleading over to the merits. Wilson v. Lineberger,
94-641.
If the answer contains, by fair construction, an admission of the mate
rial averments which should have been made in the complaint, or if it is
framed upon the presumption that such averments have been sufficiently
made, and denies them, the complaint will be aided by the answer, and
the defect thereby cured. Johnson v. Finch, 93-205 ; Knowles v. Rail
road, 102-59 ; Harris v. Sneeden, 104-369 ; Bonds v. Smith, 106-554.
Court may dismiss on motion or ex mero motu. —Whenever a defect of
jurisdiction becomes apparent in any case, the court may, on plea, sug
gestion, motion or ex mero motu, stop the proceedings and dismiss the
action. State v. Benthal, 82-664 ; Burroughs v. McNeill, 22-297 ; Branch
v. Houston, 44-85 ; contra, Pescud v. Hawkins, 71-299.
Sec. 243. Answer ; what to contain. C. C. P., 8. 100.
The answer of the defendant must contain :
(1) A general or specific denial of each material allega
tion of the complaint controverted by the defendant, or of
any knowledge or information thereof sufficient to form a
belief.
Each allegation mast be separately denied. —The answer must contain a
general or specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint.
That is to say, it must deny either the whole of each material allegation
or some material and specific part thereof. Therefore, an answer which
avers that "no allegation of the complaint is true," is bad. Such plea
is not issuable, and is a sham plea, which the court should strike out on
motion. Flack v. Dawson, 69-42 ; Schehan v. Malone, 71-440.
An answer which sets out that " no allegation of the complaint is true,"
is bad. The defendant must separately answer each allegation of the
complaint, by a general denial either of the whole allegation (not the
whole complaint) or by a specific denial of some selected or specific
part of the allegation. Heyer v. Beatty, 76-28.
An answer denying " the truth of the averments contained in the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the complaint"
(being the number contained in the complaint), is a special denial of
each allegation, and a sufficient compliance with The Code. Brown v.
Cooper, 89-237.
In an action upon an accepted draft there was a specific allegation in
the complaint stating definitely certain matters and facts, to which the
response in the answer was, "the allegations of the sixth paragraph of
the complaint are untrue in manner and form as therein stated ;" this
was not a sufficient denial under The Code. Rumbough v. Improvement
Co., 106-461.
Denial on information and belief. —The statement by defendants, on
information and belief, that the plaintiff never had possession of the
land claimed by defendants, is a sufficient denial of the allegation of
possession. Kitchin v. Wilson, 80-192.
A complaint which alleges that a certain matter was within the per
sonal knowledge of the defendant is not met by an answer " that the
defendant has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief"
in reference to it. Gas Machine Co. v. Neuse Manufacturing Co. , 91-74.
The denial must be of " sufficient information" as well as of knowledge. —An
answer that denies the defendant's knowledge of a fact alleged in the
complaint, but which does not deny that he has " information sufficient
to form a belief," is insufficient. Durden v. Simmons, 84-555 ; Bank v.
Charlotte, 75-45.
Action to recover land.—In answer to a complaint in an action to recover
land, the defendant may disclaim title to part of the tract sued for and
deny possession of such part, admitting his possession of the other part,
claiming title thereto, and denying his possession thereof to be wrong
ful. Graybeal v. Powers, 83-561.
When the answer in an action of ejectment denies plaintiff's allega
tion that he is seized in fee but fails to deny the allegation that the
defendant unlawfully withholds possession from the plaintiff, an issue
as to the plaintiff 's title is immaterial and he should have judgment.
An averment in the complaint of the "unlawful withholding " is suffi
cient under The Code. Tyson v. Shephard, 90-314.
The defendant is not bound to show title as alleged. Lenoir v. Min
ing Co., 100-473.
Effect of denial. —Where one tenant in common brings an action against
his co-tenant, claiming sole seizin in the land held in common, and the
latter sets up in his answer a general denial of the title and right to
immediate possession, as alleged, such denial is equivalent to a confes
sion of ouster in ejectment, and precludes the defendant from after
wards setting up the cotenancy on the trial for the purpose of subject
ing the plaintiff to the payment of costs. Gilchrist v. Middeton,
107-663.
An absolute denial in the answer to the allegation in the complaint,
which embodies the agreement sued on, draws in question and puts in
issue not only its validity, but its legal existence. Browning v. Berry,
107-231.
Facts to be pleaded.—The facts relied upon as a defence to an action
should set out in the answer with the same precision as that required in
a complaint. Rountree v. Brinson, 98-107.
Where a party sets up the defence that the plaintiff is not the real
owner of the instrument put in suit, he must state in his answer the
facts upon which he relies to establish the ownership in some other per
son. Deloatch v. Vinson, 108-147.
But not evidential facts. —Where the defendant in his answer denied a
material allegation in the complaint, but went on to state evidential
facts ; the bad plea did not vitiate the good one, and it should be treated
as surplusage. Farrior v. Houston, 95-578.
Plea of payment.—In an action to recover possession of land by pur
chaser from mortgagee, before condition was broken, against the mort
gagor in possession, an answer by mortgagor, "that the plaintiff has
not brought his action within the time prescribed by law, and the same
is barred by the statute of limitations," is sufficient to set up the
defence of payment presumed after ten years, under \ 19, ch. 65, Rev.
Code. Pemberton v. Simmons, 100-316.
Personal plea may be withdrawn. —The plea of "discharge in bank
ruptcy," being a personal defence to be set up by the debtor or his repsentative, may be withdrawn at any time. Lee v. Eure, 93-5.
Aider. —If the statement of the facts is not a sufficient allegation of
fraud in a complaint, yet if the defendant, in his answer, denied that he
procured the deed or the possession by fraud or collusion, the doctrine
of aider will apply. Bonds v. Smith, 106-554.
See cases cited under this head, \\ 233 (2) and 242, ante.
Frivolous answer. —An answer should never be held frivolous unless it be
so clearly and palpably bad as to require no argument or illustration to
show its character. Hull v. Carter, 83-249.
A frivolous answer is one which is manifestly impertinent as alleging
matter which, if true, does not affect the right to recover. Brogden v.
Henry, 83-274.
Where an answer is put in good faith and is not clearly impertinent,
the defendant is entitled to have the facts alleged in it either admittted
by demurrer or tried by a jury. Womble v. Fraps, 77-198.
Not frivolous answers. —If the defences set up in the answer are worthy
of serious consideration, they are not frivolous. Swepsou v. Harvey,
66-436.
An answer that the defendant has " no knowledge or information suf
ficient to form a belief" as to certain material allegations of the com
plaint, raises a sufficient issue, and cannot be stricken out as frivolous.
Bank v. Charlotte, 75-45.
Where three, only, out of four executors were sued on an obligation
of their testator, and answered, setting forth that fact : Held, that the
answer could not be set aside on motion as frivolous. Erwin v. Lowery,
64-321.
Does not apply to the reply. —This section relates only to the answer.
The reply is governed by \ 248. Boyett v. Vaughan, 79-528.
See, also, same case, 85-363.
(2) A statement of any new matter constituting a defence
or counterclaim, in ordinary and concise language, without
repetition.
Note—The following should be inserted here :
In all actions to recover damages by reason of the neg
ligence of the defendant, where contributory negligence
is relied upon as a defence, it shall be set up in the answer,
and proved on the trial. This provision shall apply to
similar actions when brought by employees against their
employers. C/i. jj, Acts 1887.
Counterclaim must be set up in the answer.—The new matter constituting
a defence or counterclaim must be set up in the answer, and cannot be
taken advantage of in any other manner. Johnson v. Bell, 74-355.
Counterclaim is really a counter action brought by the defendant. —A coun
terclaim is a distinct and independent cause of action, and when properly
stated as such, with a prayer for relief, the defendant becomes, in respect
to the matters stated by him, an actor, and there are two simultaneous
actions pending between the same parties, wherein each is, at the same
time, a plaintiff and defendant. Francis v. Edwards, 77-271.
When the plaintiff files his complaint setting forth any " transaction,"
whether it be a tort or a contract, the defendant may set up any claim
which he has against the plaintiff, connected with such transaction, and
the plaintiff cannot, by calling the transaction in his complaint by one
name or another, cut off the defendant's counterclaim growing out of it.
Bitting v. Thaxton, 72-541.
A counterclaim is a cross-action, and should state the cause of action
and relief dematided. If no relief is demanded, it is a set-off or recoup
ment. A set-off arises upon contract and out of a transaction not con
nected with plaintiff's cause of action, while a recoupment is connected
with or arises out of the same transaction upon which plaintiff founds
his action. Hurst v. Everett, 91-399.
Where sole defence is a counterclaim which is ruled out. —Where the only
defence to an action is a counterclaim, which is ruled out as inadmissible,
the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. Love v. Rhyne, 86-576.
Usury. —In an action for claim and delivery of personal property con
veyed in a mortgage, the defendant can set up as a defence that the note
secured by the mortgage was given for usurious interest. Moore v.
Woodward, 83-531.
Usurious interest previously received in the course of renewals of a
series of notes terminating in one, upon which suit is brought, cannot
be pleaded by way of set-off or payment. Oldham v. Bank, 85-241.
If usury is pleaded, the facts which it is alleged constitute it must be
specifically set forth, so that the court may see that, if true, the trans
action is illegal. Rountree v. Brinson, 98-107.
Pleading counterclaim optional.—A defendant is not bound to plead a set
off or counterclaim, but may make it the subject of an independent
action. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189; Tobacco Co. v. McElwee. 94-425;
McClenahan v. Cotton, 83-332; Francis v. Edwards, 77-271; Asher v.
Reizenstein, 105-213.
Equitable defence. -In an action to recover land, where both parties
claim under the same grantor, the defendant, being in possession under
the junior deed, can set up as an equitable defence a demand to have the
plaintiff's deed, which is older in point of time, set aside for fraixd;
otherwise, if the action was begun before the C. C. P. Johnson v.
McArthur, 64-675.
In an action for the possession of land, if the defendant relies upon
a defence that is purely equitable he must set it up in the answer instead
of merely denying that the plaintiff is the owner and entitled to posses
sion, and that he unlawfully withholds the same. Anderson v. Logan,
105-266; Hinton v. Pritchard, 102-94.
Equitable counterclaim of defendant is sufficient to defeat an action
of ejectment. Bodenhamer v. Welch, 89-78.
A counterclaim is where the answer sets up a cause of action upon
which the defendant might have sustained a suit against the plaintiff,
and the answer in such case must contain the substance of a complaint,
with a concise statement of the facts constituting a cause of action.
Where a mistake occurs in an account and settlement in which the
defendant gives his note to the plaintiff for the amount of the supposed
balance due, and the plaintiff sues upon the note, the court, under its
equitable jurisdiction, will open the settlement and allow the defendant
to show such mistake by way of counterclaim. Garrett v. Love, 89-205.
The answer may set up both legal and equitable defences. Beau v.
Railroad, 107-731.
The facts relied upon as the basis of a defence or counterclaim must
be set out in an answer with the same precision as is requisite in a com
plaint, and, therefore, a defendant who expects to prove that there was
an actual mistake by which the word "heirs ' ' was omitted from the deed
which he proposes to offer in evidence, or to insist that there is internal
evidence in such deed that the grantor intended to convey the fee and
omitted the words of inheritance by mistake, must set up his equity in
his answer. Anderson v. Logan, 105-266.
In an action to recover land.—An answer of defendants asserting title in
them to land claimed by plaintiff involves a denial of plaintiff's title,
and plaintiff must prove his title, even though it appear the defendants
have none. Midgett v. Wharton, 102-14.
Where plaintiff declares upon an oral contract respecting lands, void
under the statute of frauds, and defendant either denies the contract or
sets up affirmatively another and a different contract, or admits the
alleged contract and pleads specially the statute of frauds, in each of
these cases testimony offered to prove the alleged contract is incompe
tent and should be excluded. Holler v. Richards, 102-545.
Inadequacy of consideration. —Mere inadequacy of consideration, without
fraud or imposition, is no defence to a suit on a bond ; nor is it an objec
tion, even when equity is invoked to enforce specific performance ; and
much less is it an objection when it is invoked to relieve against a con
tract. Winslow v. Wood, 70-430.
Want of consideration in a deed. —Semble, the defence that a deed, upon
which an action to recover land is based, is without consideration, is
not open to any but creditors and purchasers for value. Ivey v. Granberry, 66-223.
Sheriff. —To a motion to amerce a sheriff for not executing summons,
he can set up as a defence that his fees had not been paid. Johnson v.
Kennedy, 70-435.
Agreement to arbitrate.—An agreement to submit the matters, involved
in an action pending, to arbitration, not made under the sanction of the
court, cannot be pleaded as defence to the action. The remedy for a
breach of such an agreement is by an independent action for damages.
Carpenter v. Tucker, 98-316.
It is too late, after submission to arbitration, to object that a counter
claim has been improperly pleaded ; the objection should have been
taken by demurrer, or otherwise, in apt time. Robbins v. Killebrew,
95-19Contributory negligence. —The statute (Laws 1887, ch. 33, supra) which
requires that, when contributory negligence is relied on as a defence, it
shall be set up in the answer, applies to actions brought by an employee
against his employer Hudson v. Railroad, 104-491.
Coverture. —The plea of coverture may be permitted for the first time in
the superior court, and after the lapse of several terms, when, at the
trial before the justice of the peace, the defendant's counsel said he
would enter all pleas to which the defendant (who was absent) might be
entitled, and appealed. Patterson v. Gooch, 10S-503.
What can be pleaded.—A defendant cannot set up as a defence or
counterclaim any and every cause of action he may have against the
plaintiff. Byerly v. Humphreys, 95-151.
A counterclaim includes any defence (except a demurrer) which does
not amount to a plea in bar. Hurst v. Everett, 91-399.
Statute of limitations.—The plea of the statute of limitations should set
out the facts upon which the defence is grounded, an averment that the
demand is barred is stating a conclusion of law. Pope v. Andrews,
90-401.
Plea in avoidance. —Where in an action on an instrument in writing, the
answer denies the allegations of the complaint, and for further defence
to the action pleads matters in avoidance, it is error for the court below
to disregard the denials and adjudge that the answer admits the instru
ment. Reed v. Reed, 93-462.
In action for libel. —Absence of malice may be pleaded and shown in
mitigation of damages, \ 266, post. Knott v. Burwell, 96-272.
Counterclaim insufficiently pleaded. —A counterclaim which only alleges
that the plaintiff is indebted to the defendant, without alleging further
the nature and kind of such indebtedness, and how it arose, is imper
fectly pleaded, and ought to be disregarded, and in such case a bill of
particulars affixed to the pleadings as a part of it does not aid it. Smith
v. McGregor, 96-101.
In action on bond transferred before maturity. —Where a bond payable to
A. B. or bearer, was transferred for value by A. B. to the plaintiff with
out endorsement and before maturity, it was subject, in the hands of the
plaintiff, to any equities and defences which existed between the original
parties at the time of the transfer. The only change in the law effected
by \ 177 of The Code, is to allow the action to be brought in the name of
the transferee, but it does not prevent the obligor from setting up any
defence which existed at the time of, or before, notice of the assignment,
and which would have been available against the obligee. Spence v.
Tapscott, 93-246.
See \ 177, ante, and \ 244 (2), post, and cases cited.
Pendency of another action,—The pendency of another action for the
same cause, to be available as a matter of defence, must be specially
pleaded, otherwise it will be considered waived. It may be set up in the
answer, with other defences, and any issue arising thereon may be sub
mitted at the same time as the others growing out of the pleadings, with
instructions to the jury that, if found for the defendant, the others need
not be considered. Hawkins v. Hughes, 104-161. See '{ 239 (3).
Former judgment. —The plea of former judgment must be distinctly set
up in the answer as new matter. It will not be considered as embraced
under general denials of the allegations of the complaint. Blackwell v.
Dibbrell, 103-270 ; Harrison v. Hoff, 102-126.
See \ 239 (3), and cases cited.
Defect of parties. —An objection, because there is a defect of parties,
should be taken advantage of by demurrer or answer in apt time, other
wise it will be deemed to have been waived. Silver Vallev Co. v. Balti
more Smelting Co., 99-445 ; Usry v. Suit, 91-406.
See \ 239 (4), and cases cited.
Sec. 244. Counterclaim. C. C. P., s, 101.
The counterclaim mentioned in the preceding section
must be one existing in favor of a defendant, and against
a plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had
in the action, and arising out of one of the following causes
of action :
(i) A cause of action arising out of the contract or trans
action set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the
plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject of the
action ;
A counterclaim cannot be pleaded in reply to a counterclaim. —A plaintiff
cannot set up a counterclaim in reply to a counterclaim pleaded by the
defendant. Boyett v. Vaugha'^ 85-363, overruling Boyett v. Vaughan,
79-528.
Pleading of counterclaim optional. —A defendant is not bound to assert a
counterclaim in an action brought against him, nor will the plaintiff's
recovery bar a subsequent action on a cause of action which he might
have set up as counterclaim but did not. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189 ;
Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, 94-425.
Must be set up by answer. —A counterclaim cannot be taken advantage
of unless set up by answer. Johnson v. Bell, 74-355.
An answer setting up a counterclaim, which fails to show that the
same subsisted between the parties when the action begun, or that it
arose out of or was connected with the subject of the plaintiff's action,
is demurrable. Reynolds v. Smathers, 87-24.
Counterclaim may arise ont of tort or contract. —A defendant may set up
as a counterclaim any claim arising out of the transaction set out in the
complaint, in his favor and against the plaintiff, whether the plaintiff's
action arises upon a tort or a contract, and without regard to the nature
of his owu claim. Bitting v. Thaxton, 72-541; McKinnon v. Morrison,
104-354The defendant may set up as a counterclaim any claim in his favor
arising out of the transaction set out in the complaint, whether it be
tort or contract, but not a tort unconnected with the transaction. Lee
v. Eure, 93-5.
A cause of action arising upon a tort, separate and distinct from the
contract relied upon in the complaint, cannot be set up as a counter
claim. Trotter v. Connor, 90-455.
A counterclaim must arise out of contract or must arise out of the
same transaction that is the subject of the complaint, and must exist at
the time of the commencement of the action. Kramer v. Electric
Light Co., 95-277.
Noneuit. —When the defendant pleads a counterclaim, a cause of action
arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint as
the foundation of the plaintiff's cause of action, the plaintiff cannot be
permitted to take a nonsuit; but when the counterclaim does not arise
out of the same transaction as the plaintiff's cause of action, but falls
under subdivision 2 of this section, the plaintiff may submit to a nonsuit.
In such case the defendant may either withdraw his counterclaim, when
the action will be at an end, or he may proceed to try it at his election.
Whedbee v. Leggett, 92-469; McNeill v. Lawton, 97-16.
A plaintiff cannot take a nonsuit when the defendant sets up a coun
terclaim arising out of the contract or transaction which constitutes the
plaintiff's cause of action, or when the defendant has acquired in an
equitable action any other right or advantage which he is entitled to
bave tried and settled in the action. Bynum v. Powe, 97-384; Purnell
v. Vaughan, 80-46.
If the defendant has pleaded a counterclaim, while the plaintiff may
be permitted to suffer a nonsuit as to his cause of action, the defendant will, nevertheless, be entitled to prosecute his counterclaim. Gatewood
v. Leak, 99-363.
Not a counterclaim.—Matters in which only the defendant and his co-de
fendant, or a third person not a party to the action, are interested, and
the settlement of which is not necessary to a final determination of the
controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, cannot be pleaded
as a counterclaim. Gibson v. Barbour, 100-192. See, also, Byerly v.
Humphrey, 95-151.
Action to recover land. —Where a vendor of land brings an action for
possession against his vendee, who has been let into possession, the title
being reserved, the latter may set up the contract of sale and ask for an
account of the payments upon the purchase-money by counterclaim in
the same action. Pearsall v. Mayers, 64-549; Wellborn v. Simouton,
88-264.
Where a deed is set aside on the ground of having been made under
duress, while the plaintiff recovers the land with rents and profits, the
defendant is entitled to a counterclaim for the increased value of the
property from the improvements put on the land by him, and the pur
chase-money. Reed v. Exum, 84-430.
In an action to recover land, the defendant, being unable to give the
defence bond required, procured a third party to execute and deposit a
mortgage in lien thereof, as provided by \ 117 of The Code. Pending
the action, the mortgagor purchased at a tax sale a portion of the laud
in suit. The plaintiff recovered against the defendant, and, in attempt
ing to enforce his recovery of costs and damages by a foreclosure of the
mortgage, was opposed by the mortgagor's application to have a refer
ence and adjustment of their relative interests in the laud recovered, and
to be credited with his share thereof: Held, that the application was
properly denied, the mortgagor's interest, if any, being wholly foreign
to the action, and he could not be allowed in this manner to interfere
with plaintiff's rights under his judgment. Ryan v. Martin, 104-176.
Although a parol contract to convey land is void by our statute of
frauds, yet, if the vendee, relying therenpon, pays the purchase-money
and makes improvements, he cannot be ousted until the vendor repays
the purchase-money and makes compensation for the value of the
improvements, and these facts constitute a valid equitable counterclaim
in an action by the vendor to recover possession of the land. Daniel v.
Crunrpler, 75-184.
Counterclaim upon cancellation of deed for duress. —Upon cancellation of
a deed alleged to have been executed under duress, while the plaintiff is
entitled to a restoration of the land, with compensation for its use and
for damages sustained, the defendant is entitled to a counterclaim for the
increased value by reason of improvements put by him on the land, and
for the purchase-money. Reed v. Exum, 84-430.
Deficiency in quantity of land. —Semble, that to an action for the pur
chase-money of land, the defendant can plead a deficiency in the quan
tity contracted for, and ask an abatement pro rata to be credited on the
note. Hutchinson v. Smith, 68-351.
Action for rent. —Where lessors sue lessees for rent, the latter are enti
tled, as a counterclaim, to plead that the lessors had no right to make
the lease, and that the real owners thereof have brought suit against one
of the lessees, and will recover damages for its use during such lease.
McKesson v. Mendenhall, 64-286.
No counterclaim for purchase-money, when.—Where the husband of a feme
covert does not join in a deed of her land, and her privy examination is
not taken, the deed is a nullity, and the vendee can maintain no counter
claim against the woman personally for the purchase-money paid by
her, nor for betterments. Scott v. Battle, 85-184, overruling Daniel v.
Crumpler, 75-184.
In an action on a bond to make title. —In an action for damages for non
performance of a bond to make title, a note given to one of the obligors
to induce her to submit to a privy examination, caunot be set up as a
counterclaim. Utley v. Foy, 70-308.
Connterclaim for damages to the reversionary interest.—In a suit by the
grantor of a life-estate upon a bond for the purchase-money thereof, the
plaintiff and defendant being tenants in common of the reversion, the
defendant cannot set up a counterclaim for damages done by the plain
tiff to the inheritance by cutting timber before the sale to the defendant.
Devries v. Warren, 82-356.
Purchaser at a mortgage sale.—While one who acquires the estate of the
first purchaser, under a mortgage sale, is affected with notice of any
defect in the title, and cannot claim an allowance for betterments as such,
he can set up an equitable counterclaim to the demand of the real
owner for rents and profits. Scott v. Battle, 85-184.
Trespass on land. —In an action for trespass for wrongful entry on land
and cutting timber, where the defendant filed a counterclaim, alleging
that the plaintiffs had wrongfully raised a dam and ponded water back
on defendant's land, which was part of the land described in the com
plaint as that on which the alleged trespass had been committed : Held,
that the counterclaim was not connected with cause of action, and that
a demurrer thereto was properly sustained. Bazcmore v. Bridgers,
105-191.
Owelty of partition. —Where a sum is charged on the share of one ten
ant in common for owelty of partition, he may set up as a counterclaim
any damage he may have sustained by having^ been evicted from a part
of his share in the land by a superior title, in an action to enforce the
charge against him. Huntley v. Cline, 93-458.
Damages on an injunction. —Where the plaintiff sues out an injunction
against cutting timber, and the defendant avers title in himself, and that
the plaintiff is cutting and carrying away the defendant's timber, and
asks an injunction and receiver, the answer raises a counterclaim proper
for the consideration of the court. Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93-22.
Damages on an attachment. —No cause of action for wrongfully suing out
a warrant of attachment can arise until there has been a legal deter
mination of the proceedings thereunder. Kramer v. Electric Light Co.,
95-277Claim sounding in damages. —It seems that a claim sounding in damages
could be used as a set-off. Raisin v. Thomas, 88-148 ; Wilson v. Char
lotte, 108-121.
Where plaintiff sues on a note, and the defendant admits the cause of
action, but pleads a counterclaim sounding in damages, which is the only
matter tried before the jury, who find a verdict in the defendant's favor,
the amount of the note sued on by the plaintiff must be deducted from
the damages given by the jury, and judgment only entered for the bal
ance. Bush v. Hall, 95-82.
Action for goods sold and delivered. —In an action to recover the price of
goods sold and delivered, the defendant may set up as a counter-claim
that the goods were not such as he contracted to receive ; since he
might have had an action for damages therefor, even though he had
received and used the goods. Howie v. Rea, 70-559 ; Cox v. Long,
69-7 ; Hurst v. Everett, 91-399.
False representations.—If representations made by one party to a con
tract, which may be reasonably relied on by the other, constitute a
material inducement to the contract, are knowingly false, cause loss to
the party relying on them, and such other party has acted with ordi
nary prudence, he is entitled to equitable relief upon such counter
claim. Walsh v. Hall, 66-233.
False warranty. —In an action for the specific recovery of a horse, the
defendant pleaded as a counterclaim, that the plaintiff sold the horse
to the defendant, and, at the time of the sale, warranted that he was
sound, which warranty was false, in consequence of which the defend
ant had been damaged : Held, that the counterclaim arose out of the
transaction set out in the complaint, and was properly pleaded as a
counterclaim. Wilson v. Hughes, 94-182.
Fraud or mistake a valid counterclaim.—Where a horse, exchanged for land,
returned to its first owner, upon action brought to recover possession :
Held, that fraud in the sale of the land for which it had been exchanged
was a valid counterclaim against the party obtaining the horse by such
fraud. Walsh v. Hall, 66-233.
The allegation of fraud or mistake in the consideration of the bond
sued on could not be set up as a defence at law, but would be ground
for relief in equity. It is, therefore, a valid counterclaim in an action
on the bond. Hall v. Commissioners, 74-130.
Mutual stipulations in a contract. —The stipulations contained in a con
tract in these words, viz : "A contracts with B to furnish from 500 to
1,000 bushels of coal daily, at 64 cents per bushel, to be measured at the
pit ; B to furnish timber gratis whenever he may see fit, reserving groves
and fruit trees, and advance to A all the money, weekly, necessary to pay
off the wood-choppers; coal to be paid for on delivery," are mutually
dependent, and if, without fault on the part of B, and without legal
excuse, the other, A, fails to deliver the quantity of coal agreed to be
delivered, B, being sued for the value of the coal, etc., furmshed, may
properly set up such failure by way of counterclaim. Burton v. Wilkes,
66-604. See, also, Wilson v. Charlotte, 108-121.
Bank notes. —The maker of a note due a bank has a right to tender in
payment of such note the bills issued by the bank, and he cannot be
deprived of such right either by the assignment of the bank or by act
of the legislature. Blount v. Windley, 68-1 ; Mann v. Blount, 65-99 '1
and such right extends to the payment of judgments in favor of the
bank in its own bills. Bank v. Tiddy, 67-169 ; Bank v. Hart, 67-264.
Conversion of personal property of married woman. —Where the purchaser
of the separate personal property of a married woman, sold under exe
cution for a debt of her husband, is sued after the wife's death by the
husband as administrator for such conversion, he cannot set up as a
counterclaim his claim to be reimbursed the amount of his bid at such
sale. Holliday v. McMillan, 83-270.
Covenant not to sue.—A covenant not to sue the defendant may be made
available by the latter, by way of counterclaim, to defeat an action
brought in violation thereof. Harshaw v. Woodfin, 64-568.

up as a counterclaim that the title to the property is in a third person.
Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467.
Individual indebtedness of members of a partnership.—When a defendant is
sued on a debt due a partnership, he may set off against it the individual
indebtedness of one or all the partners to himself. Sloan v. McDowell,
71-356.
Action by personal representative. —In an action by the personal repre
sentative of the owner, for claim and delivery of a horse, against the
bailee, the defendant cannot set up as a counterclaim the debt due him
for feeding and taking care of the horse. Mauney v. Ingram, 78-96.
Agreement with the administrator. —Where a party bought at an admin
istrator's sale under an agreement that the administrator was to take
and pay for part of the articles purchased, and the purchaser executed
his note for the whole amount : Held, that this agreement can be pleaded
in a suit by the administrator on the note as a counterclaim for the part
of the purchases the administrator agreed to pay for. Clark v. Clark,
65-655Action began before C. C. P. —In an action of ejectment begun before
the adoption of The Code, and tried afterwards, the defendant cannot
set up an equitable counterclaim under this section. Gaither v. Gibson,
But this does not prevent the equitable owner of land from demanding
specific performance, notwithstanding the action was instituted prior to
1868. Young v. Griffith, 79-201.
Before a justice of the peace. —No counterclaim can be entertained by a
justice of the peace, the amount of which exceeds his jurisdiction. Boyett
v. Vaughan, 85-363 ; Meneely v. Craven, 86-364 ; Derr v. Stubbs, 83-559.
Contra, a defendant in a justice's court can plead by way of defence a
set-off which is over two hundred dollars. McClenahan v. Cotten, S3332- .
Neither a justice of the peace nor the superior court on appeal has
jurisdiction of a counterclaim in damages assessed at over, though vol
untarily reduced to, $200. Raisin v. Thomas, 88-148.
On appeal from a justice. —The court may allow a defendant to set up
a counterclaim, after au appeal from a justice's judgment, in its discre
tion. Johnson v. Rowland, 80-1 ; Thomas v. Simpson, 80-4.
No amendment in the superior court will be allowed in a case on ap
peal from a justice which would permit a counterclaim to be pleaded
which is in amount beyond the justice's jurisdiction. Meneely v. Cra
ven, 86-364.
Where several actions are brought in the justice's court, the defend
ant has the right to set up such defence in each until the amount of his
damages is exhausted, and, on appeal to the superior court, if the
actions are consolidated, he can recoup the whole amount in the one
action. Hurst v. Everett, 91-399.
(2) In an action arising on contract, any other cause of
action arising also on contract and existing at the com
mencement of the action.
Counterclaim mnst exist when action brought. —A counterclaim must exist
at time of bringing action. Hogan v. Kirkland, 64-250.
An answer setting up a counterclaim, but which fails to allege that
the same subsisted between the parties when the action begun, or arose
out of, or was connected with, the subject of the plaintiff's action, is
demurrable. Reynolds v. Smathers, 87-24.

Counterclaim valid against a lien. —In an action upon contract, though a
lien upon property is involved, it is competent for the defendant to
extinguish the debt by proof of a counterclaim. Poston v. Rose, 87-279.
If the counterclaim is pertinent. —If the answer presents new matter,
which is pertinent and bona fide relied on, the regular mode to test its
legal sufficiency as a defence is by a demurrer. Hull v. Carter, 83-249.
Nonsuit. —When the counterclaim does not arise out of the same trans
action as the plaintiff's cause of action, but falls under this subdivision,
the plaintiff may submit to a nonsuit. In such case the defendant may
either withdraw his counterclaim, when the action will be at an end, or
he may proceed to try it, if he so elects. Whedbee v. Leggett, 92-469 ;
McNeill v. Lawton, 97-16.
Damages. —Damages to realty are not a counterclaim to an action on
contract for payment of money. Street v. Bryan, 65-619.
Damages for a breach of a covenant not to sue may be set up as a
counterclaim. Russell v. Adderton, 64-417.
Where personal property is tortiously taken and sold, the owner may
waive the tort, affirm the sale and recover for money had and received,
and such claim for damages can be pleaded as a counterclaim to an
action on a contract. Wall v. Williams, 91-477.
Suit by the state. —A person indebted to the state, when sued upon such
indebtedness, cannot set up as a counterclaim the indebtedness of the
state to him upon past due coupons of its bonds. Battle v. Thompson,
65-406.
Municipal corporation. —Where a municipal corporation is indebted to a
tax-payer, the latter is not entitled, either in law or equity, to have the
amount due him applied as a set-off or counterclaim against the amount
he owes for taxes. Gatling v. Commissioners, 92-536.
Action by or against a personal representative. —A defendant sued as a per
sonal representative cannot use as a set-off or counterclaim, against a
creditor of the estate, a claim against such creditor purchased subsequent
to the death of the testator or intestate. McClenahan v. Cotten, 83-332.
Where an estate is insolvent no counterclaim against an action by the
personal representative, beyond the ratable proportion of him who
pleads the counterclaim to the assets, will be allowed. Rountree v.
Britt, 94-104 ; Pate v. Oliver, 104-458.
Where an administrator recovers judgment upon his cause of action,
and the defendant also upon his counterclaim, the former is entitled to
an execution for the entire amount of his recovery; but the execution
on the defendant's judgment will be stayed until it is ascertained what
amount of the assets of the estate of the intestate is applicable thereto.
Rountree v. Britt, 94-104.
While one who is sued by an administrator, cannot set up a demand
in his favor against the plaintiff in his individual capacity, as a counter
claim or set-off, yet if the administrator is insolvent, and a portion of
the recovery will belong to him in his individual capacity, such claim
may be set up as a retainer in the nature of a set-off. Carr v. Askew,
94-194.
Plaintiffs sued the defendant, who was their step-father, and adminis
trator of their deceased father, for their distributive shares in their
father's estate. The defendant set up as a counterclaim the money
expended by him in the necessary support of plaintiffs during their
minority, and while they lived with him as a part of his family : Held,
(1) that as plaintiffs' demand was against the defendant personally, for an
estate wasted and misapplied, there was no want of mutuality in defend
ant's demand for reduction of plaintiffs' claim, although it was not
strictly a counterclaim ; (2) that as the parties in this cause constituted
one family, and were provided for in common, and it did not appear that
the defendant step-father had not means of his own, sufficient for the
support of the plaintiffs, plaintiffs incurred no liability to defendant,
upon an implied contract, for their support and maintenance. Mull v.
Walker, 100-46.
Funeral expenses. —A claim for funeral expenses can be pleaded as a
set-off, in a suit brought by the personal representative for a debt due
the deceased. Barbee v. Green, 86-158.
legacy. —A legatee can set up an account due him from an estate as a
counterclaim to a suit on a note due by him to the executors. Whedbee
v. Reddick, 79-521.
Purchase by creditor at an administrator's sale. —A creditor of one de
ceased, by note (there being no other debt of equal or higher dignity),
became purchaser at a sale by the administratrix, and gave bond on that
account (in an amount less than that of his claim], and this bond consti
tuted the whole assets of the estate ; after the bond became due, the
administratrix, who, with her sureties, was then insolvent, assigned it
by endorsement for value, to one who was, to a small amount, creditor of
the estate by account : Held, that the creditor by note was entitled to
bring in his debt as a counterclaim against an action upon his bond,
whether by the administratrix or her assignee. Ransom v. McClees,
64-17.
Note assigned after maturity. —A note assigned after maturity is subject,
in the hands of the assignee, to any set-off or other defence existing at
the time of the assignment, or before notice thereof, against the assignor.
Harris v. Burwell, 65-584 ; Martin v. Richardson, 68-255, overruling
McConnaughey v. Chambers, 64-284, and Neal v. Lea, 64-678.
Bote assigned before maturity. —A negotiable note, endorsed before matu
rity, is not subject, in the hands of the endorsee, to a set-off in favor of
the maker, of a debt due by the payee at the time the note was made ;
and the presumption of the law is that the holder of negotiable paper
takes it for value and before dishonor, and that an undated endorsement
was made at the date of the note. Tredwell v. Blount, 86-33.
Assignment of non-negotiable paper. —An assignee for value of nonnegotiable paper, who takes it even before due, and without notice of
equities between prior parties thereto, holds it subject to all equities and
counterclaims existing at the time the maker received notice of the
assignment. Bank v. Bynum, 84-24.
Claim purchased by a debtor after a general assignment by the creditor.—A
claim assigned by the creditor of a firm after the registration of a deed
in trust, executed by the firm to a trustee to pay debts, is not a counter
claim in an action by the trustee. The assignee of such claim is only
entitled to share, as the creditor would have been, in the pro rata distri
bution of the assets when collected. Brown v. Brittain, 84-552.
Purchase of note of insolvent plaintiff after suit brought.—Where the
defendant purchased a uote on the plaintiff during the week of the trial
term of the action, he is not entitled to have it applied in satisfaction of
the plaintiff's claim. Such a case is not embraced by the second clause
of this section, because it was not "existing at the commencement of
the action ; " nor by the first clause of said section, as it is not "connected with the subject of the action." Neither has the defendant any
right to an equitable set-off upon the mere ground of insolvency of the
plaintiff. Riddick v. Moore, 65-382.
Contingent liability of surety. —The surety to an insolvent debtor cannot
be compelled to pay a debt he owes his principal until relieved of the
responsibility of his suretyship, and he may plead this as a counterclaim
against his principal or his assignee with notice, and this, though the
rincipal has been adjudged a bankrupt, and such debt has been assigned
im in his exemptions. Scott v. Timberlake, 83-382.
This defence will avail the surety equally against an assignee of the
note past due when assigned, or assigned with notice. Walker v. Dicks,
80-263.
An adjusted account. —A claim for services, when once adjusted and
allowed by the parties, cannot be attacked for illegality, when presented
as a counterclaim against the assignee of the party for whom the ser
vices were rendered. Lusk v. Patton, 70-701.
Suit by a firm,—Where a firm brings a defendant into a court to answer
a claim for a debt which he owes them, he may not only require them,
but either one of them, to answer for a debt due him, whether it is con
nected specially with their claim against him, or is an independent claim.
Sloan v. McDowell, 71-356.
See, also, cases under preceding subsection and under \ 243, subsection
2, ante.
Set-off. —The defence of set-off, as heretofore administered, has been
merged by The Code in that of counterclaim. Neal v. Lea, 64-678.
Judgment aa a set-off. —The clause of The Code which forbids an action
upon the judgment of any court, other than that of a justice of the
peace, without leave, does not forbid the use of such judgments as setsoff. McClenahan v. Cotten, 83-332.
Where A is sued by the executrix of B, on a note given for the pur
chase of land sold by the executrix, and on the trial A offers as a set-off
a judgment paid by him as B's surety, this, in administration granted
prior to 1st of July, 1S69, is not a counterclaim. McLean v. Leach, 68-95.
Before C. C. P. —Where an action was commenced before C. C. P.,
uuliquidated damages arising on executory contract, are not a set-off as
a counterclaim. Terrell v. Walker, 66-224.
Sec. 24"t. Several defences. C. C. P., s. 102.
The defendant may set forth by answer as many defences
and counterclaims as he may have, whether they be such
as have been theretofore denominated legal, equitable, or
both. They must each be separately stated and numbered,
and refer to the cause of action which they are intended to
answer, in such manner that they may be intelligibly dis
tinguished.
Inconsistent defences. —Inconsistent defences in an answer are admissible
if properly and distinctly set out. Ten Broeck v. Orchard, 79-518; Reed
v. Reed, 93-462.
Where a defendant sued for an account, sets up in his answer matter
in bar of an account, but also demands a reference and account, the
demand for the account will not be construed as a waiver of the other
defences, but must be understood as contingent upon the failure of the
other defences. Therefore, such a demand in answer is not a variance.
Mull v. Walker, 100-46.
Several defences.—Where there are several defences to the same cause
of action, they may all be pleaded, but each is as separate and independ
ent of the other as if contained in different records. Sumner v. Chipman, 65-623; Keathley v. Branch, S8-379.
Both legal and equitable defences. —A defendant may set up any defence
which would have been available under the old mode of procedure,
either in a court of law or court of equity. Clark v. Clark, 65-655.
The defendant can set up as many defences as he may have, either
legal or equitable, or both. Melvin v. Stephens, 82-283; Bean v. Rail
road, 107-731.
Under the former practice, in actions on a special contract to pay for
services to be rendered, and which were rendered; no evidence in defence
or to reduce the recovery was admissible to prove any misconduct on the
part of the plaintiff or dereliction in the service; but, since The Code,
this defence may be set up and the entire controversy settled in one
action. Chamblee v. Baker, 95-9S.
Where one advances money to pay the balance on purchase of land
for another, and takes title to himself, he and those who claim under
him hold the legal title in trust for the original vendee; and when these
facts sufficiently appear from the pleadings or proofs, the court will
administer the appropriate remedy, though it may not be in response to
the specific prayer for relief in the answer. Dempsey v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Not a defence. —Where, in an action to have an alleged forged mortgage
cancelled as a cloud upon title, the defendant sets up as a defence that
the money advanced upon such forged mortgage was used to pay off a
prior genuine mortgage, and asks to be subrogated to the rights of the
first mortgagee: // was held, that these facts could not be pleaded, either
as a defence or counterclaim, in this action, but the defendant must set
them up in a new action. Byerly v. Humphrey, 95-151.
See, also, Gibson v. Barbour, 100-192.
False representations. —False representations, if acted upon, are an
equitable defence. Walsh v. Hall, 66-233.
Answer will be rejected, when.—An answer which fails to state separately
the distinct grounds of defence will be rejected if excepted to in apt
time. Keathley v. Branch, 88-379.
Sec. 240. Demurrer and answer. C. C. P.,s. 103.
The defendant may demur to one or more of several
causes of action stated in the complaint, and answer to
the residue.
Cannot answer and demur. — A defendant cannot answer and demur to
the same cause of action, at the same time. Von Glahu v. DeRossett,
76-292. See I 184, ante.
A defendant having proceeded to answer, etc., without reference to a
demurrer previously filed, is held to have waived it. Wilson v. Pearson,
The same defendant may demur to one and answer as to another of
two or more causes of action in one complaint; or, as to a single cause
of action, some defendants may answer arid some may demur, and the
issues of law will, in either event, be so raised as to require the court to
pass upon them. Conant v. Barnard, 103-315.
Demurrer must be to an entire cause of action. —The demurrer, however,
must be to an entire cause of action or defence, and not to the separate
allegations of such cause of action or defence. Sumner v. Young, 65-579.
See, also, cases cited under \ 238, ante.
Where there are several defendants. —Where stockholders of a bank are
sued upon their joint liability, a part cannot demur and the rest answer.
Their liability is joint and inseparable, and their interest in the ques
tions involved are identical ; and one cannot be allowed to demur and
another answer, any more than a single defendant could be allowed to
demur and answer at the same time. Von Glahn v. DeRossett, 76-292.
Sec. 247. Sham and irrelevant defences. C. C. P., ». 104.
Sham and irrelevant answers and defences may be
stricken out on motion, and upon such terms as the court
may, in its discretion, impose.
Should not be held frivolous unless palpably so. —The court will not readily
decide an answer to be frivolous, which was intended to raise a serious
question. Erwiu v. Lowery, 64-231.
An answer should not be stricken out as frivolous where the matter
objected to, as presented, or in any other form, might constitute a
defence. Boone v. Hardie, 83-470.
An answer should not be held frivolous, unless palpably so. Hull v.
Carter, 83-249 ; Womble v. Fraps, 77-198. Semble, that a refusal to hold
an answer frivolous, is not appealable. Hull v. Carter, 83-249.
Not frivolous. —A denial of certain of the allegations of the complaint,
made in the form prescribed, i. e., of any knowledge or information
thereof, sufficient to form a belief, being allowed by the Code of Civil
Procedure, raises, when interposed, a sufficient issue ; and such answer
cannot be stricken out as a sham defence. Bank v. Charlotte, 75-45.
An answer to a complaint on a covenant for the payment of mouey,
executed by the defendants, and alleged to have become the property of
the plaintiff by successive assignments, which alleges that there was a
condition underwritten said covenant, to make it void if the land, for
which the covenant was given, was subject to encumbrances, and that
at the time of the execution of the same, said land was subject to the
lien of an execution against the covenantee, and further, that the assign
ment of the covenant from the covenantee was procured by duress and
fraud, and while the covenantee was mentally incapacitated to contract,
and that the plaintiff took his assignment with full knowledge of these
facts, and that the plaintiff had caused a previous action on the same in the
name of the covenantee, to be brought, which had been dismissed, and
had filed a bill to compel the covenantee to allow the use of his name
for that purpose, which had also been dismissed, and that afterwards the
defendant had, after a full account with the covenantee, procured his
release of the cause of action : Held, that such defences are not frivo
lous, but are worthy of serious consideration.
Distinction between a sham defence and an irrelevant or frivolous one. —A
sham answer is false in fact ; an irrelevant or frivolous one has no sub
stantial relation to the controversy, and presents no defence to the action,
though its contents be true. Howell v. Ferguson, 87-113.
Sham and frivolous answers. —A frivolous answer is one which is mani
festly impertinent, alleging matters which do not affect the plaintiff's
right to recover. Dail v. Harper, 83-4 ; Brogden v. Henry, 83-274.
An answer averring that " no allegation of the complaint is true," will
be stricken out on motion, as frivolous. Flack v. Dawson, 69-42 ;
Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467.
An answer denying "the complaint, and each and every allegation
therein contained," is sham and irrelevant, and should be stricken out
on motion. Shehan v. Malone, 71-440.
In an action against a tax-collector for failure to collect and pay
over the county taxes, an answer setting up, as a sole defence, a coun
terclaim based on an equal or greater amount of county debts paid off
and taken up by him, should be stricken out as a sham defence, since
the tax-list is in the nature of an execution in the hands of a tax-col
lector, on which he is bound to make the money. Com'rs v. Piercy,
72-181.
To a complaint by an executor, in which the execution by the defend
ant of the bond sued on, the death of the obligee, the appointment and
qualification of the plaintiff, and that no payment had been made, were
duly averred, the defendant answered that he was informed and believed
that the plaintiff was not the owner of the bond at the time of the com
mencement of the action : Held, that the answer was sham and irrele
vant, and, on motion, was properly stricken from the record. Deloatch
v. Vinson, 108-147.
Frivolous demurrers. —In an action upon a note made in 1865, a demur
rer which alleges (1) "that the prayer for judgment does not set out any
amount as claimed ; and (2) that it would seem that the plaintiff desired
to claim the value of gold at the time the note was given, and not when
it fell due," is frivolous, and should be stricken out as sham and irrele
vant. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
A demurrer which raises no serious question of law is frivolous. John
ston v. Pate, 83-110.
A demurrer to a complaint in an action brought by an executor that it
does not allege that the probate of will and qualification were before suit
brought, when the allegation is "before complaint filed," is frivolous.
Hurst v. Addington, 84-143.
Where the complaint charged the defendant with having received money,
as an agent, and his refusal to pay it over, "though often requested
to do so," aud the defendant demurred, assigning grounds therefor (1)
that the complaint did not show that the parties were citizens of the
United States, aud (2) that there was no allegation of a demand; the
demurrer was frivolous. Porter v. Grimsley, 98-550.
Where an irrelevant issue is made by the answer. —Where an irrelevant
issue raised by the answer is the only one submitted to the jury, and
they find a verdict for the defendant, the court should render a judg
ment for the plaintiff non obstante veredicto. Rowland v. Windley,
82-131.
Motion to strike out must be made iu apt time. —A motion to strike out
improper matter from the complaint, will not ordinarily be heard after
answer or demurrer filed, or leave granted for additional time to plead.
Best v. Clyde, 86-4.
Sec. 248. Reply ; demurrer to answer. (.'. C. P., s. 105.
When the answer contains new matter constituting a
counterclaim, the plaintiff may reply to such new matter,
denying generally or specifically each allegation contro
verted by him or any knowledge or information thereof
sufficient to form a belief; and he may allege, in ordinary
and concise language, without repetition, any new matter
not inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a defence
to such new matter in the answer ; and the plaintiff may
in all cases demur to an answer containing new matter,
where, upon its face, it does not constitute a counterclaim
or defence ; and the plaintiff may demur to one or more of
such defences or counterclaims, and reply to the residue of
the counterclaims. And in other cases, when an answer
contains new matter constituting a defence by way of avoid
ance, the court may, in its discretion, on the defendant's
motion, require a reply to such new matter ; and, in that
case, the reply shall be subject to the same rules as a reply
to a counterclaim.
What the reply may contain.—A reply may contain new matter not refer
red to in the complaint nor counterclaim, if not inconsistent with the
complaint. Boyett v. Vaughan, 79-528. Overruled by Boyett v. Vaughan,
Although a counterclaim to a counterclaim is not allowed, yet when
it is pleaded at an early stage of the action, and no objection is made to
it, this court will not strike it out when the action has been long pend
ing, but will consider it as an amendment to the complaint. Scott v.
Bryan, '96-289.
Where, in an action of ejectment, the defendant sets up an equitable
defence, the plaintiff may reply equitable matter in rebuttal, although
not set up in the complaint. Hardin v. Ray, 94-456.
In an action to recover possession of property, the defendant alleged
in his answer matters which arose subsequent to the commencement of
the suit, and upon which he demanded affirmative relief. On the trial,
after the jury was empaneled, the plaintiff demurred, ore tenus, to so
much of the answer as referred to the said new matters : Held, (1) that
the objection came too late, and if it had any force it should have been
made at the time the answer was filed ; (2) that although the matter was
not strictly a counterclaim, yet, as it was pertinent to the subject of the
action, and the court had jurisdiction, by consent of parties, or with
the sanction of the court, it was proper to consider the questions thus
raised, aud determine the action upon the merits, as upon a plea " since
last continuance." Puffer v. Lucas, 101-281.
The plaintiff brought an action for the specific performance of a con
tract to convey land ; the defendant answered, setting up an abandon
ment and rescission of the contract ; the plaintiff replied, admitting the
rescission, but alleged that the defendant agreed to reimburse him for
improvements made while he was in possession, and demanded judg
ment therefor : Held, that this was not such a departure from the original
cause of action as to warrant the dismissal of the action, and as the two
demands arise out of the same transaction, they might be determined in
the same action. Houston v. Sledge, 101-640.
Where the defendant, a railroad company, as a defence to an action
for damages, set up a release, it is proper to set up in reply matters
which, if true, will avoid it, whether legal or equitable. Bean v. Rail
road, 107-731.
Court may require reply.—New matter set up in an answer not relating to
the counterclaim is deemed denied without further pleading, but the court
may require a formal reply thereto. Fitzgerald v. Shelton, 95-519.
Where no counterclaim is set up in the answer,—Where the answer sets up
no counterclaim, but denies the title of the plaintiff to one-half of the
land in suit, and alleges an assignment of his estate to one of the defend
ants, no repty is necessary, unless the court, on the defendant's motion,
shall so order. Jones v. Cohen, 82-75.
It is only when a counterclaim is relied 0n that the plaintiff's failure
.to reply may afford ground for a judgment for want of a replication.
Barnhart v. Smith, 86-473.
Demurrer to answer. —When an answer was sworn to before "A B, clerk
of the superior court," and the plaintiff replied that A B was "not a
clerk of the superior court," and the defendant demurred, the demurrer
was sustained, because the title to an office cannot be determined in this
collateral way. Culver v. Eggers, 63-630.
In case of demurrer to the answer, the question is, whether the facts
thus admitted are sufficient to determine the rights of the parties.
Blackwell v. Willard, 65-555.
A demurrer to the answer of the defendant, on the ground that it did
not state what disposition, if any, had been made of the real estate of
the intestate, is insufficient where it is not alleged in the complaint and
did not appear that there was any real property belonging to the estate.
Lee v. Beaman, 73-410.
A demurrer to an answer "for that it does not state that the entire
personal property of the intestate has been exhausted," must be over
ruled, where it is alleged in the answer that "the Confederate money
thus received was the only assets remaining in the hands of the defend
ant, and that the same is worthless." Ibid.
A demurrer upon the ground "that the answer does not state by whom,
nor to whom, nor in what amount refunding bonds were executed," must
be overruled, when the answer states "that refunding bonds were taken
from the next of kin, according to law, with solvent sureties, and filed
in the clerk's office, and that these bonds had become insolvent by the
results of the war." Ibid.
A demurrer "because the answer does not state at what time the
defendant received Confederate money for the property of his intestate,"
must be overruled when the answer does state the date and terms of the
sale, and that the money was paid when due. Ibid.
IS demurrer to answer is sustained.— Ordinarily, if a demurrer to the
answer is sustained, the judgment of the court will be final; but where
the defect is the omission of an averment which can be remedied by
amendment, leave to amend will be granted. Foy v. Haughton, 83-467.
Sec. 249. Motion for judgment on answer. C. C. P.,s. 10<i,
If the answer contain a statement of new matter consti
tuting a counterclaim, and the plaintiff fail to reply or
demur thereto, the defendant may move for such judgment
as he is entitled to upon such statement; and, if the case
require it, an order for an inquiry of damages, by a jury,
may be made.
Judgment on counterclaim. —It is only when a counterclaim is relied on
that the plaintiff's failure to reply may afford ground for a judgment for
want of a replication, but not when the matter constitutes a defence to
the action merely. Barnhart v. Smith, 86-473.
An equitable counterclaim may be asserted in an answer to a complaint
containing a purely legal cause of action, and. if not denied by reply or
demurrer in apt time, the defendant is entitled to judgment for such
relief as the facts therein set forth may warrant, though it be not the
relief he demands. Dempsey v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Sec. 250. Demurrer to reply. C. C. P., 8. 107,
If a reply of the plaintiff to any defence set up by the
answer of the defendant be insufficient, the defendant may
demur thereto, and shall state the grounds thereof.
Objection to reply. —In an action for specific performance of contract for
sale of land, defendant set up a rescission of contract by agreement, and
plaintiff admitted the agreement, but alleged that the same was made
on condition that defendant was to pay a sum of money, which had not
been paid, and demanded judgment for the amount; defendant demurred
for that the plaintiff's reply was not consistent with the complaint:
Held, that there was error in refusing to overrule the demurrer, since
neither the alleged unperformed condition of rescission nor the money
demanded is inconsistent with the pleading. Houston v. Sledge, 98-414.
If an answer or reply is insufficient, the opposite party may move for
judgment, and if the motion is refused he can have his exception noted.
If he fails to do this, the objection is usually waived. Walker v. Scott,
Sec. 251. Jurisdiction of clerk on pleadings, etc. C. C. P.,
8. 1U8.
The clerk of the superior court shall have jurisdiction to
hear and decide all questions of practice and procedure in
this court, and all other matters whereof jurisdiction is
given to the superior court, unless the judge of said court,
or the court at a regular term thereof, be expressly refer
red to.
Summons returnable to the term.—The act of March, 1869, "suspending
the Code of Procedure in certain cases," is not unconstitutional in
requiring summons to be returnable at term time. McAdoo v. Benbow,
63-461.
As to return of summons before the adoption of the above act, in civil
actions, see Johnson v. Judd, 63-498.
Special proceedings. —The summons in special proceedings is returnable
before the clerk. Tate v. Powe. 64-644.
For distinction between civil actions and special proceedings, see
\\ 126, 127, 130, ante, and cases there cited ; also see \\ 278 to 289, post.
Leave to sue in forma pauperis. —The clerk may make an order for a
party to sue as a pauper, either in the superior or probate court, and as
well for a guardian as one suing in his own right. Brendle v. Herron,
68-496.
Consult, also, \\ 210 and 237, ante, and cases there cited.
Amendments. —The clerk has authority to allow amendments in a war
rant of attachment. Cushing v. Styron, 104-338.
Where, in proceeding to sell land for assets, the decree for sale em
braced some land which was the property of one of the defendants, and
which did not belong to the ancestor, but by a mistake the defendant
did not discover it until after the sale, and when the notice to confirm
the sale was made the clerk had the power, and he committed no error,
in amending the order of sale, so as to omit the defendant's land
therefrom. Maxwell v. Blair, 95-317.
Equitable jurisdiction. —The clerk has no equitable jurisdiction, except
when specially conferred by statute. Bragg v. Lyon, 93-151.
Legal custodian of court records. —The superior court clerk is the legal
custodian of the records of the old county court, and no one has any
right to take them from his possession or make any change or alteration
in them. Commissioners v. Blackburn, 68-406.
Removal of administrator. —The probate court in 1869 (and semble the
clerk now) had the power, for good and sufficient cause, to remove an
administrator ; or for like cause, as necessarily equivalent, to permit him
to resign his trust. Tulburt v. Hollar, 102-406.
Probate court.—While the office of probate judge is abolished, the duties
thereby devolved upon the clerk are separate and distinct from his duties
as clerk of the court. Brittain v. Hull, 91-498.
Creditor's bill. —The filing of a claim with the clerk, by a creditor, gives
him a standing in court, in proceedings by way of a creditor's bill, and
is all he is required to do, unless the claim is contested. Warden v.
McKinnon, 94-378.
Dissolution of attachment. —The clerk has power to vacate an attach
ment, notwithstanding the act of 1870-'71, which makes the process
returnable in term time. Palmer v. Bosher, 71-291.
Executions. —Application for an execution to issue on a judgment of
more than three years' standing should be made to the clerk, and not to
the judge of the superior court. McKeethan v. McNeill, 74-663.
The clerk has jurisdiction of a motion to set aside an execution. McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
Duty to notify sheriff to stay execution pending an appeal. —It is the duty
of the clerk to notify the sheriff whenever a bond to stay execution
pending an appeal is filed in his office, in order that any execution
which may have been issued may be suspended and a proper return
made upon it. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
Supervisory power of the judge. —The judge has power to supervise and
control the action of the clerk in passing upon the sufficiency of bonds
taken in cases pending in the superior court. Marsh v. Cohen, 68-283.
Sec. 252. Any party may appeal. C. C. P., 8. 109.
Any party may appeal from any decision of the clerk of
the superior court, on an issue of law or legal inference, to
the judge, without undertaking.
Appeal lies. —Where an issue of fact is raised before the clerk, nojudg
ment can be rendered, but the case must be transferred to the court for trial. It is only upon questions of law where the clerk must give judg
ment, from which an appeal may be taken. Powell v. Morisey, 98-426.
An appeal lies from the clerk to the judge in allotment of dower.
Welfare v. Welfare, 108-272.
A judge of probate, upon proper cause shown, has the right to set
aside the sale and order a re-sale of the property. Though the exercise
of this right is discretionary with the judge of probate, it is still such a
matter oflegal discretion, involving a " matter of law or legal inference,"
that an appeal will lie from his decision. Lovinier v. Pearce, 70-167.
The rejection by the probate court of the ward's demand that the
guardian file an annual statement of the manner and nature of his invest
ments of her estate entitles the ward to appeal. Moore v. Askew, 85-199.
See cases cited under \ 255, post.
Sec. 253. Appeals, when taken, and by whom. C. C. P.,
s. 492.
An appeal must be taken within ten days after the entry
of the order or judgment of the court; but an appeal can
only be taken by a party aggrieved, who appeared and
moved for or opposed the order or judgment appealed from,
or who, being entitled to be heard thereon, had no notice
or opportunity to be heard, which fact may be shown by
affidavit or other proof.
For construction of provisions as to appeals from the superior court,
see cases cited under \\ 548, 549 and 550, post.
Sec. 254. Duty of clerk on appeal prayed. C. C. P., s. 110.
On such appeal, the clerk, within three days thereafter,
shall prepare a statement of the case, of his decision, and
of the appeal, and shall sign the same. He shall, within
the time aforesaid, exhibit such statement to the parties,
or their attorneys on request. If such statement is satis
factory, the parties or their attorneys shall sign the same.
If either party object to the statement as partial or errone
ous, he may put his objections in writing, and the clerk
shall attach such writing to his statement, and, within two
days thereafter, he shall send such statement, together with
the objections, and copies of all necessary papers, by mail
or otherwise, to the judge residing in the district, or, in
his absence, to the judge holding the courts of the district,
for his decision.
Statement of case. —Where an appeal is taken from a decision of the
clerk to the judge, the clerk should prepare and send up to the judge a
statement of the case, embracing all the material facts passed on by
him, and copies of all papers which came before him. Brooks v. Austin,
94-222.
This section does not apply to appeals from the clerk as judge of probate. —
This section of The Code (C. C. P., 1 110) has never been applicable to
an appeal from a probate judge, but only to appeals from the clerk to
the judge in matters of pleading and practice in civil actions, when they
were returnable before him. Lovinier v. Pearce, 70-167.
Contra, Brittain v. Mull, 91-498; Welfare v. Welfare, 108-272.
Appeal. —In appeals from the clerk, in that class of cases of which he
has jurisdiction, not as and for the court, nor as in special proceedings,
but in his capacity as clerk, such as the auditing the accounts of execu
tors and administrators, it is not necessary that he should prepare and
transmit to the judge any statement of the case on appeal. In appeals
in such cases, it is the duty of the judge to determine the questions of
fact and law raised, and, for this purpose, if the evidence accompanying
the papers is not satisfactory, he can require the production of other
evidence. The judge can decide the questions of fact in such cases
himself, or, if he see fit, he can submit issues for his better information
to the jury. Spencer, ex parte, 95-271.
The clerk has no authority to allow or disallow an appeal. If the
clerk refuses to prepare a statement of the case, the judge, at term or
in chambers, may, by simple order, direct him to do it. Bank v. Burns,
107-465.
Amendment. —Where the clerk refuses to allow an amendment, he may,
and should state his reason for such refusal, even after appeal to the
court in term. Cushing v. Styron, 104-338.
Distinction between issues of fact and questions of fact. —An issue of fact
made before a probate judge must be transferred to the superior court
for a trial before a jury ; but there are questions, of fact as motions to
vacate an order, in which his findings of fact may be reviewed by the
judge. Lovinier v. Pearce, 70-167.
Vacation of judgment of former county court.—A motion to vacate a judg
ment rendered in the former county courts in a matter touching the
administration of an estate, should be made before the clerk as judge of
probate. Wescott v. Hewlett, 67-191.
Demurrer filed. —Where, in a special proceeding, to make real estate
assets, before a probate judge, a demurrer is filed to the complaint, the
issue of law raised thereby should be certified to the judge at chambers.
Jones v. Hemphill, 77-42.
Issues of law and fact.—If issues, both of law and fact, are raised before
the clerk by the pleadings in a special proceeding, he should transfer
■ the case to the civil issue docket for trial of the issues, both of law and
fact, at the ensuing term of said court. Jones v. Hemphill, 77-42 ;
McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
Sent to the judge of the district. —Such issues can only be sent to the judge
of the district in which they are pending ; but a judge who exchanges
districts with another for a whole riding or a series of courts, becomes
the judge of the district for all purposes during the time he is engaged
in holding such courts. Bear v. Cohen, 65-511.
The judge of one district cannot decide issues from another. Myers
v. Hamilton, 75-567 ; Morris v. Whitehead, 65-637.
Sec. 255. Duty of judge on appeal. C. C. P., s. 113.
It shall be the duty of the judge, on receiving a state
ment of appeal from the clerk, or the copy of the record of
an issue of law, to decide the questions presented within
ten days. But if he shall have been informed in writing,
by the attorney of either party, that he desires to be heard
on the questions, the judge shall fix a time and place for
such hearing, and give the attorneys of both parties reason
able notice thereof. He shall transmit his decision in writ
ing, endorsed on or attached to the record, to the clerk of
the court, who shall immediately acknowledge the receipt
thereof, and, within three days after such receipt, notify the
attorneys of the parties of the decision, and on request and
the payment of his legal fees, give them a copy thereof ;
and the parties receiving such notice may proceed there
after according to law.
The following amendment was adopted. Ch. 276, Acts
1887:
Whenever any civil action or special proceeding begun
before the clerk of any superior court shall be for any
ground whatever sent to the superior court before the judge,
the said judge shall have jurisdiction ; and it shall be the
duty of said judge, upon the request of either party, to
proceed to hear and determine all matters in controversy
in such action, unless it shall appear to him that justice
would be more cheaply and speedily administered by send
ing the action back to be proceeded in before the clerk, in
which case he may do so.
Powers of the judge. —Upon such appeal the judge may review the find
ings of the clerk upon matters of fact. McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
In an appeal from the rulings of the clerk on a demurrer to an applica
tion before him to make real estate assets, the judge has no power to
grant license to sell. He should transmit his decision to the clerk with
leave to the defendant to answer, if he choose to do so. The appeal
gives the court jurisdiction for no purpose, beyoud the decision of the
demurrer. Jones v. Hemphill, 77-42.
It is the duty of the judge to decide the question thus presented, and
to transmit his decision in writing to the clerk, who will then proceed
with the special proceeding according to law. It is irregular for the
judge, in making his decision, to order the clerk to place the proceeding
on the docket of the regular term for trial, it being the duty of the clerk
to do this without such order, when issue of fact is joined. Jones v.
Desern, 94-32.
Where the parties agree that the judge shall hear the appeal in term,
he acquires jurisdiction of the whole case, and should finally dispose of
it on its merits, without remanding it to the clerk. Cushing v. Styron,
104-338.
Where a special proceeding is duly transferred from the clerk's office
to the superior court in term, and the court in term, having jurisdiction
of the subject-matter, with the assent of the parties interested, finally
disposes of the case, such action is regular and will be upheld, although
the proceeding, as originally constituted, was not within the jurisdiction
of the clerk, and would be so even if ch. 276, Laws 1887, did not apply
to this case. McMillan v. Reeves, 102-550 ; Capps v. Capps, 85-408.
From a judgment of the superior court affirming an order of the
clerk apprenticing and awarding the custody of a child, the mother
appealed to the supreme court, where the judgment was held to be erro
neous, upon the grounds that the facts found did not warrant it. When
the matter came again before the superior court upon the certificate of
the supreme court—additional evidence was heard, which brought the
case within the statute : Held, it was competent for the judge to deter
mine the matter without sending it back to the clerk. Ashby v. Page,
108-6.
On an appeal, in special proceedings, from the ruling of the clerk
upon a question of law, to the judge, it is the duty of the latter to
transmit his decision to the former with directions to proceed in confor
mity therewith. Tillett v. Aydlett, 93-15.
Dnty of Clerk. —In special proceedings, when the issues are tried in the
superior court, it is the duty of the clerk to proceed at once to act upon
the case, without waiting for any order of the judge. Brittain v Mnll,
94-595Where on appeal from an order or judgment of the clerk, the judge
rules that there is error, it is the duty of the clerk to proceed to enter
the proper judgment without any formal order directing him to do so.
Patterson v. Wadsworth, 94-538.
After clerk has gone out of office. —Where a clerk has gone out of office,
it is not proper to order him to file with the court, in writing, the evi
dence offered and admissions made in a proceeding pending before him
while be was clerk. Spencer, ex parte, 95-271.
Judge may decide in vacation or in term.—Where an appellant elects to
carry a case from the probate court to the judge in vacation, it is still
within the discretion of the latter to hear it in term time, and vice versa.
Rowland v. Thompson, 64-714.
Appeal from the judge to the supreme court.—In case of such an appeal,
if there be a further appeal from the judge to the supreme court, the
latter tribunal can review no point before the probate court that was not
passed upon by the judge of the superior court. Rowland v. Thomp
son, 64-714.
Judge's docket.—Quare, whether the act suspending The Code in cer
tain cases may make it unnecessary for the judge to keep a docket, and
will make the entry of judgment in civil actions in vacation irregular.
Graham v. Charlotte & S. C R. R. Co., 64-631.
Amendment in the superior court after appeal. —Where a complaint which
states matters properly triable in the probate court is amended in the superior court on appeal by engrafting new matter cognizable only by
the superior court in term, a demurrer averring defect of jurisdiction
over such matter will be sustained. If, however, a case wrongfully beguu
before the clerk gets into the superior court by appeal or otherwise, and
the latter has jurisdiction of the whole cause, it will proceed to its
determination and make all amendments of process needful to give
effectual jurisdiction. Capps v. Capps, 85-408.
Where a special proceeding was instituted by an administrator for
license to sell lands and was transferred to the civil issue docket to be
tried upon issues joined, and thereafter the plaintiff, without objection,
was allowed to amend his complaint by alleging fraud in obtaining a
former decree in another suit, where the defendant claimed title, and
an amended answer was filed and issues also joined thereon, which
were tried with the others : Held, that this procedure was very irregular,
and ought not to have been permitted, but as there was no opposition
to it and the court had jurisdiction, its action might be upheld. Glover
v. Flowers, 101-134.
Sec, 256. Judgment on a matter of law may be appealed
from. C. C. P., s. 115.
Any party within ten days after notice of such judg
ment, may appeal to the supreme court of the state from
such judgment, upon any matter of law or legal inference
therein, under the regulations provided for appeals in
other cases. But execution shall not be suspended until
the undertakings required by this Code shall have been
given. If issues, both of law and of fact, or issues of fact
only, are raised before the clerk of the superior court, he
shall transfer the case to the civil issue docket for trial of
the issues at the ensuing term of the superior court.
Issues of law and fact. —If issues of law and fact are both raised, the
clerk should transfer the case to the civil issue docket for trial at the
next term of the court. Jones v. Hemphill, 77-42; McAden v. Banister,
63-478.
In special proceedings pending before clerks, the parties have the
right to insist that any issue of fact raised by the pleadings shall be
framed by the clerk and transmitted to the superior court in term for
trial by jury, and, where they fail before an order appointing commis
sioners is made, to insist upon a verdict upon the controverted facts,
they waive the right of trial by jury, even if it be conceded that the
statute gives them the right to demand it. Railroad v. Parker, 105-246.
In proceedings to fix the quantum of compensation to land-owner for
right-of-way condemned for use of railroad, the parties are not entitled,
as a matter of constitutional right, to a trial by jury. Railroad v. Davis,
19-451; Mclntire v. Railroad, 67-278; Britt v. Benton, 79-177.
For requirements as to appeals under this section, see \\ 548, 549 and
550, post, and cases there cited.
For decisions as to jurisdiction and powers of clerks, see more fully
\\ 278 to 289, post, and cases there cited.
Sec. 257. Pleadings to be subscribed and verified. C. C. P.,
8. 110.
Every pleading in a court of record must be subscribed
by the party or his attorney; and when any pleading is
verified, every subsequent pleading, except a demurrer,
must be verified also.
Complaint not verified.—That the complaint is not verified is not ground
for a motion to dismiss the action. The effect is simply to dispense with
the necessity of verifying subsequent pleadings. Reynolds v. Smathers,
87-24.
Complaint verified and answer not. —When the complaint is verified, and
the answer is not, the plaintiff is entitled, on motion, to judgment, as
for want of an answer. Alspaugh v. Winstead, 79-526; Alford v. McCormac, 90-151.
Where a pleading is verified, every subsequent pleading, except a
demurrer, must be verified also. Ibid.
Not evidence unless introduced. —Statements and admissions in the plead
ings may be used as evidence against the party pleading them, but they
must be introduced as evidence at the proper time, so as to give the
party against whom they are used an opportunity to reply to and explain
them. Smith v. Nimocks, 94-243; Greenville v. Steamship Co., 104-91.
When a party intends to use pleadings as evidence, he should put
them in evidence. Merely reading them to the jury is not sufficient for
this purpose. Smith v. Smith, 106-498.
Pleading filed after judge has left. —A pleading placed on the files of the
court after the judge has' left for the term is not filed in contemplation
of law, unless there is an order allowing time to file pleadings. Foley
v. Bank, 92-476.
Amendment of pleading after verification. —A pleading which is amended
in any material part after verification, is regarded as not verified ; therefore, the subsequent pleadings need not be verified. Rankin v. Allison,
64-673.
Action against landlord and tenant. —When, in an action against both the
landlord and tenant, to recover possession, the tenant fails to swear to
his answer, the complaint being verified, the plaintiff may take judg
ment against him ; but cannot have execution against him, until the
further order of the court, which will not be made until after the trial
of the issues between him and the landlord defendant. The damages
against the tenant will be a matter of inquiry at the trial with the land
lord, or separately, as the court may direct. Harkey v. Houston, 65-137.
Suspension of C. C. P. —This section is not affected by the act suspend
ing The Code. Haywood v. Bryan, 63-521.
Admissions in pleadings. —The admissions of a party made in the plead
ings are competent evidence against him, even though the party subse
quently, by leave of court, files pleadings amended in that respect.
Adams v. Utley, 87-356.
Where a motion to amend an answer is disallowed, the defendant can
not avoid the effect of the answer by a disclaimer, ore tenus, of the
defence set up. The facts alleged in the answer are legal evidence against
him. Brooks v. Brooks, 90-142.
A party to an action is bound by every act of his attorney, done with
out fraud or collusion, in the regular course of practice in the conduct
of the cause, however injudicious the act may be. Beck v. Bellamy,
93-129...
It is not competent to contradict a proposition made by a party in one
action by a pleading prepared by his attorney involving the same facts,
but in a different action. Eigen'brun v. Smith, 98-207.
Sec. 258. Pleadings, how verified. C. C. P., a. 117. 1868-'9,
c. 159, s. 7. 1891, c. 140.
The verification must be to the effect that the same is
true to the knowledge of the person making it, except as
to those matters stated on information and belief, and as
to those matters, he believes it to be true, and must be by
affidavit of the party, or, if there be several parties united
in interest, and pleading together, by one at least of such
parties acquainted with the facts, if such party be within
the county where the attorney resides, and capable of mak
ing the affidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the
agent or attorney, if the action or defence be founded upon
a written instrument for the payment of money only, and
such instrument be in the possession of the agent or attorney,
or if all the material allegations of the pleading be within
the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When
the pleading is verified by any other person than the party,
he shall set forth in the affidavit his knowledge, or the
grounds of his belief on the subject, and the reasons why
it is not made by the party . When a corporation is a party,
the verification may be made by any officer thereof ; and
when the state, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is a party,
the verification may be made by any person acquainted with
the facts. The verification may be omitted when an admis
sion of the truth of the allegation might subject the party
to prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used
in a criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a
fact admitted or alleged in such pleading. Any judge, or
clerk of the superior court, notary public in or out of the
state, or justice of the peace, shall be competent to take
affidavits for the verification of pleadings, in any court or
county in the state, and for general purposes.
Note.—The words "in or out of the state " in line four from the end
of this section were added by ch. 140, acts 1891.
Verification by an officer of a corporation. —A verification to a complaint
by an officer of a corporation need not set forth " his knowledge or the
grounds of his belief and the reason why it is not made by the party."
The verification by its officer is the verification of the corporation itself.
Bank v. Hutchinson, 87-22.
When a pleading by a corporation is required to be verified, the verifi
cation must be made by an officer thereof ; a verification by an agent
merely will not suffice. Bank v. Manufacturing Co., 108-282.
Verification by an attorney or agent.—A verification to a complaint by an
attorney or agent of a non-resident to the effect that the claim sued on
is in writing and in his possession for collection, giving facts in his per
sonal knowledge and from other sources of information, is sufficient.
Johnson v. Maxwell, 87-18.
A verification may be made by an agent or attorney where the action
or defence rests "upon a written instrument for the payment of money
only " and such instrument is in his hands, or the material allegations
lie within his personal knowledge, and in such case the affidavit itself
must show the knowledge or grounds of his belief and the reasons why
it is not made by the party himself. Cowles v. Hardin, 79-577.
The statute in regard to the verification of pleadings, contemplates
only two cases in which the affidavit may be made by the attorney :
One, when the action is founded upon a written instrument for the pay
ment of money only, and such instrument is in the possession of the
attorney ; and the other, when the material allegations are within the
personal knowledge of the attorney. Hammerslaugh v. Farrior, 95-135.
Where a verification to a complaint stated that it was made by the
attorney because the plaintiffs were non-residents, and that his means
of knowledge were derived from an affidavit of the plaintiff, and from
admissions made to him by the defendant, but did not state that the
material allegations were within his persona1 knowledge : // was held,
to be insufficient, and the defendant had the right to file an unverified
answer. Hammerslaugh v. Farrior, 95-135.
When a verification of a pleading is allowed to be made by an agent
it should set forth his knowledge, or grounds of belief, and why it is
not made by the principal party. Banks v. Manufacturing Co., 108-282.
Verification need not be subscribed. —An affiant is not required by the
statute to subscribe the affidavit. It is sufficient if the oath be admin
istered by one authorized to administer oaths. Alford v. McCormac,
90-151.
Does not apply to auxiliary remedies. —The requirements as to an "agent"
under this section do not apply to affidavits to procure ancillary reme
dies. Bruff v. Stern, 81-183.
Where verification is required by statute. —Where a statute requires a
complaint to be verified, a failure to do so is a fatal defect, for which
the judgment will be arrested. Cowles v. Hardin, 79-577.
Form of verification.—A verification that "the facts set forth in the
foregoing complaint are true," is sufficient. Alspaugh v. Winstead,
79-526.
A verification "to the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of the affiant," is insufficient. Benedict v. Hall, 76-113; Cowles v.
Hardin, 79-577.
A verification discriminating between the facts averred upon knowl
edge and those resting upon information and belief is sufficient. Paige
v. Price, 78-10.
Verification of amended or subsequent pleading by the same party. —Where
the same party files a properly verified pleading, either by reply or
amendment, it cures an insufficient verification of the first pleading.
Benedict v. Hall, 76-113.
Before notary public.—A verification before a notary public out of the
state is insufficient. Benedict v. Hall, 76-113 ; Paige v. Price, 78-10.
Note. —This is now changed by the amendment since engrafted into
above section.
Sec. 259. 1tems of account; particulars to be furnished,
when. C. C. P., s. 118.
It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a
pleading the items of an account therein alleged ; but he
shall deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a
demand thereof, in writing, a copy of the account, which,
if the pleading is verified, must be verified by his own oath,
or that of his agent or attorney, if within the personal
knowledge of such agent or attorney, to the effect that he
believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence
thereof. The court or the judge thereof may order a further
account when the one delivered is defective ; and the court
may, in all cases, order a bill of particulars, of the claim
of either party to be furnished.
Objection to bill of particulars to be presented before trial. —The party who
insists upon the rejection of testimony, because the bill of particulars
has not been furnished, should have that question presented and settled
before the trial begins. Wiggins v. Guthrie, 101-661 ; State v. Brady,
107-822.
Becomes part of pleadings. —The object of this section, requiring the
furnishing a bill of particulars, and declaring that on failure to do so,
the party upon whom the demand is made shall be precluded from giv
ing evidence thereof, is to supply a defect in that respect in the com
plaint or answer, and when furnished, it becomes a part of the proceed
ings. Wiggins v. Carter, 101-661.
In action to recover land. —Where a single action is brought to recover
possession of several trespassers of a tract of land consisting of several
contignous tracts, the court may, in its discretion, require a bill of par
ticulars, or order the action divided. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95.
In contested election cases. —In an action involving the title to the office
of sheriff, a complaint which alleges the aggregate number of illegal
votes alleged to have been cast for the defendant, the grounds upon
which the charges of illegality are based as to each class, and when and
where the votes were polled, the defendant, upon his motion for a " bill
of particulars," cannot claim as of right a fuller and more definite speci
fication of what the relator expects to prove. It is not requisite that the
plaintiff should be required to give the defendant the name of every
alleged illegal voter as to whom he proposes to offer proof. Boyer v.
Teague, 106-576.
In criminal actions also. —When an indictment, otherwise valid, does
not convey sufficient information to enable the defendant to prepare his
trial, he can apply for a bill of particulars. The rule governing appli
cations for a bill of particulars stated. State v. Brady, 107-882.
Sec. 260. Pleadings, how construed. C. C. P., s. 119.
In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of deter
mining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed,
with a view of substantial justice between the parties.
Modification of former system of pleading. —The rules of pleading at com
mon law have not been abrogated by the C C P., the essential princi
ples still remain. Parseley v. Nicholson, 65-210 ; Oates v. Gray, 66-442.
Contra. —The subtle science of pleading heretofore in use is not merely
relaxed, but is abolished, and few, if any, of the ancient rules are now
applicable. Moore v. Edmiston, 70-510.
The common law rule that every pleading should be construed against
the pleader, is reversed by the present Code system, which requires that
all pleadings shall be liberally construed, with a view of substantial
justice between the parties, Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394 ; Purcell v. Rail
road, 108-414.
Liberal construction. —The objection that the complaint sets out a cause
of action which, under the old practice, would be in trover, while the
proof shows a claim in assumpsit, cannot defeat a recovery ; since the
distinction between common law actions has been abolished, no objec
tion founded on such distinction can be allowed. Oates v. Kendall,
67-241The provision, in our present constitution, by which the distinction
between actions at law and suits in equity is abolished, and the subse
quent legislation, affects only the mode of procedure, and leaves the
principles of law and equity intact. The courts, as now constituted, give
relief, not merely to the extent, and in cases where it was heretofore
given by the courts of law, but also to the extent and in the cases where
it was heretofore given by the courts of equity ; in other words, the prin
ciples of both systems are preserved, the only change being that these
principles are applied and acted on in one court and under one and the
same mode of procedure. Lee v. Pearce, 68-76.
" The distinction between actions at law and suits in equity is abol
ished, and there shall be but one form of action," in the constitution
and all legislation based on it, must be taken to affect only the form of
procedure and to leave intact the principles, which, from the nature of
the proceeding, must, of necessity, be applied, whether in a court of
law or a court of equity. Haughton v. Newberry, 69-456. ''
Restrictions on liberal construction. —When the defendant, by demurrer,
points out the defects of the complaint, and the plaintiff then fails or
refuses to amend, as he would be allowed to do, he is not taken by sur
prise, and has no right to claim 1 benefit in the supreme court, which
he has refused in the court below. Nor would substantial justice be
done to the parties by a construction so liberal as to hold that the
demand here (the averment being simply " the same has been demanded
before the bringing of this action,") was both made upon the proper
officer, and after a compliance with all the prerequisites to a valid
demand. Jones v. Commissioners, 73-182.
While it is better that every pleading should be formal, orderly and
precise, yet it is sufficient if intelligible, and the allegations of a plead
ing should be liberally construed. Buie v. Brown, 104-335.
When pleadings are substantially sufficient, a demurrer will not be
sustained. McEachin v. Stewart, 106-336.
Ambiguity or uncertainty. —In case of ambiguity and uncertainty in
pleading, the words are to be taken most unfavorably to the party using
them. Wright v. McCormick, 67-27.
Sec. 261. Irrelevant or redundant; indefinite or uncer
tain. C. C. P., 8. 120.
If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a plead
ing, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person
aggrieved thereby, but this motion must be made before
answer or demurrer, or before an extension of time to plead
is granted. And when the allegations of a pleading are
so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the
charge or defence is not apparent, the court may require
the pleading to be made definite and certain by amend
ment.
Judge cannot act except upon motion. —The judge cannot act under this
section, except upon a motion made. Ten Broeck v. Orchard, 79-518.
Contra. —Pleadings should clearly and plainly allege the cause of action
or defence, and where they fail to do so the court may, ex mero molu,
direct them to be reformed. Turner v. Cuthrell, 94-239; Buie v. Brown,
104-335The court in which an action is pending has the power, and it is its
duty, to require any pleading to be amended so as to make it plain,
definite and certain. McKinnon v. McIntosh, 98-89.
Motion must be made in apt time. —A motion to strike out improper mat
ter in a complaint will not ordinarily be heard after answer or demurrer,
or even after an order for time to plead. No appeal lies from a refusal
to grant such motion, if made after that time. Best v. Clyde, 86-4.
The objection that the averments in the complaint are so vague and
uncertain that no judgment can be rendered on it comes too late after
an answer has been filed denying the allegations. Morgan v. Bank,
93-352.
An objection to a pleading on the ground that it is vague, or because
it does not conform to an order of the court under which it is filed,
should be made at the time of filing, and ought not to be entertained if
it is delayed until the action is called for trial. Irvin v. Clark, 98-437.
Not ground for demurrer.—The statement in a complaint of redundant
matter or of evidential facts is n0 ground for demurrer. Thames v.
Jones, 97-121.
Redundai.cy, impertinence, argumentativeness and uncertainty in
pleading cannot be taken advantage of by the demurrer. The objection
should be made by motion before answer or demurrer. Smith v. Summerfield, 108-284.
If the facts which constitute the alleged cause of action are stated
substantially in the complaint, or can be reasonably inferred therefrom,
but the pleading is defective in matter of form, the proper remedy is by a
motion, before trial, to require the pleader to make the necessary amend< ment. The objection will not be sustained if made by demurrer or upon
exception to evidence. Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394; Moore v. Edmiston,
70-510; Fulps v. Mock, 108-601.
Court will order pleadings made more definite. —If the allegations of a
pleading are not sufficiently certain, the court, on application, will order
it to be made more precise. Speight v. Jones, 99-143; Johnston v. Pate,
83-110; Fitzgerald v. Shelton, 95-519; Richards v. Smith, 98-509; Stokes
v. Taylor, 104-394; Fulps v. Mock, 108-601.
Objections disregarded. — The new system of pleading in its whole struc
ture and scope looks to a trial of causes upon their merits, and discoun
tenances objections which may be removed. Halstead v. Mullen, 93-252.
Mere matters of evidence should never be pleaded, as they do not
raise issues, and when they are pleaded they should be disregarded.
Farrior v. Houston, 95-578.
Either under this section or 247, ante. —An irrelevant or frivolous plead
ing can be stricken out under either \ 247, ante, or undor this. Com
missioners v. Piercy, 72-181.
Offensive language in pleadings. —Pleadings that use offensive language
should be struck out and reformed. Mitchell v. Brown, 88-156.
See cases cited under \\ 247 and 260 as specially applicable here. See,
also, \ 388, post.
Sec. 262. Judgments, how to be pleaded. C. C. P., s. 121.
In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court
or of an officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be nec
essary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such
judgment or determination may be stated to have been
duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial,
the facts conferring jurisdiction.
Judgment in another action. —A court will not take judicial notice of a
decree rendered by it in a separate and independent action, but the party
relying on it must plead it. Daniel v. Bellamy, 91-78.
Sec. 263. Conditions precedent, how to be pleaded; instru
ment for payment of money only. C. C. P., s. 122.
In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in
a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts show
ing such performance ; but it may be stated generally that
the party duly performed all the conditions on his part ;
and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading
shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing
such performance. In an action or defence founded upon
an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be
sufficient for the party to give a copy of the instrument,
and to state that there is due to him thereon, from the
adverse party, a specified sum which he claims.
Pleading. —It is not necessary to state the facts, but merely to allege
performance. Britt v. Ins. Co., 105-175.
Set: 264. Private statutes, how pleaded. C. C. P., s. 123.
In pleading a private statute or right derived therefrom,
it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and
the day of its ratification, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof.
Must be pleaded. —When the plaintiff relies upon a private statute, he
must plead it in his complaint. Hughes v. Com'rs, 107-508.
Public statute need not be pleaded. —It is never necessary that the plead
ings shall set out a public statute. Com'rs of Bnrke v. Com'rs of
Buncombe Co., 101-520.
Judicial notice. —The court is required by this section of The Code to
take judicial notice of any private statute which is referred to by its title;
so that a complaint, which refers in this manner to a statute by which
the plaintiff claimed to have been incorporated, is to be regarded as set
ting forth such statute in full, as a part of the cause of action. Trustees
v. Satchwell, 71-111.
Railroad charter. —The statute (ch. 82, Laws of 1848-'49) incorporating
the North Carolina Railroad Company is a private act; and it is error to
permit it to be read and commented on to the court or jury until it has
been properly introduced as evidence. Durham v. Railroad, 108-399.
Sec. 265. Libel and Slander, how stated in complaint. C.
C. P., s. 124.
In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the pur
pose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the
defamatory matter out of -which the cause of action arose ;
but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same
was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and
if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be
bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or
spoken.
Sufficient statement.—In case of a demurrer to a complaint in an action
for libel, upon the ground that it was " too vague and indefinite to war
rant a judgment," the court say, Rodman, J., delivering the opinion :
"This section was intended to do away with the refined and subtle dis
tinctions, which had found a place in the common law pleadings in
actions for libel." When a complaint alleges that " the defendant pub
lished, concerning the plaintiff, in a newspaper," etc., "a certain article
containing the false and defamatory matter following. 1 ' etc. , it sufficiently
avers that the defamatory matter was concerning the plaintiff. Carson
v. Mills, 69-122.
In an action for slander it is material only to aver in the complaint
that the slanderous words were spoken of the plaintiff ; the facts which
point them and convey to the hearer the sense in which they are used,
are matters of proof before the jury. Wozelka v. Hettrick, 93-10.
Negative averments not necessary. —The plaintiff in an action for slander
is not required to negative in his complaint that words actionable per se
were not spoken in such a manner or under such circumstances as
rendered them privileged, and this though it appeared from the com
plaint that they were spoken in or about a judicial proceeding. Gudger
v. Penland, 108-593.
Sec. 206. Answer in such cases. C. C. P., s. 125.
In the actions mentioned in the preceding section, the
defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circum
stances to reduce the amount of damages ; and whether he
prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the
mitigating circumstances.
Mitigation of damages. —In actions for defamation under the former
system of pleading, evidence offered to sustain a plea of the general
issue could not be considered in mitigation of damages, but this has
been changed by this section. Knott v. Burwell, 96-272.
Justification and statute of limitations. —An answer alleging that the
defendant "did not speak the words charged with malice, but that he
was informed and believed them to be true in substance and effect,"
stating the grounds of his belief, and alleging that he "did not admit
that the words charged were spoken within six months before suit
brought," amounts, under The Code, to pleading justification and the
statute of limitations. Moore v. Edmiston, 70-510.
Place and circumstances. —The place where the words are spoken and
the circumstances of excuse or privilege are matters of defence. Gudger
v. Penland, 108-593.
Sec. 2(>7. What causes of action may be joined in the same
complaint. C. C. P., 8. 126.
The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several
causes of action, whether they be such as have been hereto
fore denominated legal, or equitable, or both, where they
all arise out of:
Any number of causes of action may be joined. —Any number of causes of
action may be embraced in one complaint, provided they all belong to
any one of the classes named below. Sutton v. McMillan, 72-102 ;
Land Co. v. Beatty, 69-329 ; Logan v. Wallis, 76-416 ; Young v. Young,
81-91.
The causes of action must affect all the parties to the action.—The causes
of action must affect all the parties to the action, except in case of
actions to foreclose mortgages. Land Co. v. Beatty, 69-329 ; Logau v.
Wallis, 76-416.
See cases cited under the subsections of this section, also cases cited
under subsection 5 of \ 23d ante.
Where causes of action are between same parties and joinder is convenient.—
Where different causes of action are of the same character and between
the same parties litigant, and the joinder is convenient to them, the
court will usually refuse to sustain an objection to the joinder. King v.
Farmer, 85-22.
The provisions of The Code in regard to the joinder of causes of
action, have not made any substantial change for the rules of equity
practice in regard to multifarious bills, except to enlarge the right to
unite in one action different causes of action. Under the former equity
practice, the bill was not multifarious, when there was a general right
in the plaintiff, covering the whole case, although the rights of the
defendants may have been distinct. Heggie v. Hill, 95-303.
Actions in the nature of a creditor's bill may be now maintained
-without precedent judgments and executions in all cases where they
could, under the former practice, have been maintained after the obtain
ing of such judgments or the issuing of such executions. Hancock v.
Wooten, 107-9.
Misjoinder. —A cause of action to foreclose a mortgage on one tract of
land cannot be joined with a cause of action to obtain possession of
another tract. Edgerton v. Powell, 72-64.
A complaint cannot join a cause of action of which the court has
jurisdiction with one of which it has not jurisdiction. Finch v. Baskerville, 85-205.
Nor a cause of action based on the contract of one defendant with a
cause of action on the fraud of both in procuring said contract. N. C.
Land Co. v. Beatty, 69-329.
A cause of action founded on a tort cannot be united with one founded
on a contract. Logan v. Wallis, 76-416 ; Doughty v. Railroad, 78-22.
Where a complaint contains a cause of action of which the court has
not, and others of which it has jurisdiction, the court will disregard the
former and try the latter. Ashe v. Gray, 90-137 ; Singer Manufacturing
Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
In a special proceeding for partition, it is erroneous to permit the persoral representative of the ancestor of the tenants in common to inter
plead and apply for a license to sell the lands for assets. Garrison v.
Cox, 99-478.
A cause of action against a clerk of the superior court for damages
resulting from malfeasance in accepting an insufficient bond from an
administrator, cannot be joined with a cause of action against such
administrator and his sureties for a devastavit, the respective liabilities
of the parties having no connection. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 96-14.
Objection must be taken by answer or demurrer. —The objection of a mis
joinder of causes of action must be taken by answer or demurrer, and
if not taken by either, cannot be taken by motion upon the trial. Burns
v. Ashworth, 72-496 ; McMillan v. Edwards, 75-81.
The maker and endorser of a note cannot be sued jointly with the guarantor.—
A plaintiff cannot unite a cause of action against A and B as the maker
and endorser of a note, with a cause of action against C. as the guaran
tor of a judgment rendered on such note. Wooten v. Maultsby, 69-462.
Joinder of several causes of action against different defendants. —Where a
general right is claimed arising out of a series of transactions tending
to one end, the plaintiff may join several causes of action against
defendants who have distinct and separate interests. Young v. Young,
81-91.
Court may order action to be divided. —Where two causes of action are
improperly joined the court may order the action to be divided. Street
v. Tuck, 84-605 ; Finch v. Baskerville, 85-205.
(1) The same transaction or transaction connected with
the same subject of action ;
Can be joined.—A demand for re-execution of a lost deed and for pos
session of the land. McMillan v. Edwards, 75-81.
For debt and to declare void conveyances alleged to have been made
by the debtor in fraud of the complaining creditor. Bank v. Harris,
84-206.
A note for less than two hundred dollars may be united with an open
account to make up a sum sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the
superior court, and such complaint is not objectionable, either on
account of the misjoinder or on account of each cause of action being
for less than two hundred dollars. Sutton v. McMillan, 72-102.
So, too, a cause of action for failure to account may be joined with
one for combination to defraud in conveyance of his ward's lands, in
an action against one who has been a guardian of the plaintiff. Adams
v. Quinn, 74-359.
To a complaint which charged the defendant with :
" 1. Harboring and maintaining his wife ;
2. The conversion of personal property to which the plaintiff was
entitled jure mariti ;
3. Inducing the wife, while harbored and maintained, to execute to
the defendant a deed for land under which he had received the rents
and profits ; and
4. Converting to his own use certain articles of personalty named in
a marriage settlement between the plaintiff and his wife;"
The defendant demurred for misjoinder of causes of action, which was
overruled below, and that ruling was sustained in the supreme court.
Hamlin v. Tucker, 72-502.
Joinder of partnership and individual liability. —A cause of action arising
on joint contract as a partner may be joined with a personal liability
for the conversion of the plaintiff's goods, provided the plaintiff waives
the tort embraced in such taking. Logan v. Wallis, 76-416.
Joinder of prayers for divers relief. —A complaint can join prayers for
divers relief, when, if the primary relief demanded is granted, the
others follow as a matter of course, as here—the setting aside a decree
for fraud and the annulling of deeds given for land sold under it and
the recovery of the land and rents, with injunction against waste.
England v. Garner, 86-366.
Creditors affected by fraud of common debtor. —Creditors affected by the
fraud of a common debtor in the conveyance of his property, can join
in one action to subject the same to the payment of their debts. Mebane
v. Layton, 86-571.
Joinder permissive, not compulsory.—The present system of pleading per
mits but does not compel the joinder of separate causes of action arising
out of "the same transaction, or transaction connected with the same
subject of action." Gregory v. Hobbs, 93-1.
(2) Contract, express or implied ; or,
Action on official bonds. —A complaint can join causes of action against
an officer upon two official bonds, given for separate terms of office,
against him and the sureties common to the two bonds. Syme v. Bunt
ing, 86-175.
A complaint in which are joined two causes of action—one upon a
clerk's bond and another upon an administrater's bond—is demurrable.
Street v. Tuck, 84-605.
Judgments.—Where the cause of action set out in the complaint, was
several judgments rendered by a justice of the peace, each for a less
sum than two hundred dollars but aggregating more than that sum : //
was held, (1) that the causes of action were properly joined ; and (2)
that the superior court had jurisdiction. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
Penalties. —Notwithstanding each of the penalties does not exceed
(200 (and if only one was sought to be recovered a justice of the peace would have jurisdiction), a plaintiff may unite several causes of action
for several penalties against same party, in same complaint, and if the
aggregate amount thereof exceeds $200, the superior court will have
jurisdiction. Maggett v. Roberts, 108-174.
(3) Injuries with or without force to person and property,
or to either ; or,
(4) Injuries to character ; or,
(5) Claims to recover real property, with or without dam
ages for the withholding thereof; and the rents and profits
of the same ; or,
Action to recover land. —The vendor of land who has not been paid, has
two remedies, one in personam against the vendee, the other in rem to
subject the land, and he may pursue both of these at the same time, and
may also maintain an action to recover the possession. Allen v. Tay
lor,' 96-37.
Where in an action to recover several tracts of land, the plaintiff sets
out his claim of title, the allegations in this respect cannot render the
complaint demurrable on the ground that it joins several distinct
causes of action. Thames v. Jones, 97-121.
A plaintiff, in the same action, may unite a demand for the re-execu
tion of an unregistered lost deed and for the possession of the land
embraced therein. Jennings v. Reeves, 101-447.
The owner of land or of several contiguous tracts consolidated into
one body, may bring a single suit to recover possession against a number
of trespassers, and it is sufficient to allege that plaintiff is in possession
of some part of it. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95.
(6) Claims to recover personal property, with or without
damages for the withholding thereof; or,
(7) Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or
by operation of law.
The prosecution to a successful result of a former action against the
defendants therein, to declare them trustees of the legal title, for the
conveyance and the recovery of the possession of certain lands, is no
bar to a subsequent action for the recovery of the rents and profits
whilst the defendants were in possession. Gregory v. Hobbs, 93-1.
But the causes of action so united must all belong to one
of these classes, and except in actions for the foreclosure of
mortgages, must affect all the parties to the action, and not
require different places of trial, and must be separately
stated. In actions to foreclose mortgages, the court shall
have power to adjudge and direct the payment by the mort
gagor, of any residue of the mortgage debt that may
remain unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises,
in cases in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable
for the debt secured by such mortgage ; and if the mort
gage debt be secured by the covenant or obligation of any
person other than the mortgagor, the plaintiff may make
such person a party to the action, and the court may
adjudge payment of the residue of such debt remaining
unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises, against
such other person, and may enforce such judgment as in
other cases.
Foreclosure of mortgage. —A plaintiff may unite in the same action a
demand for the foreclosure of a mortgage, a judgment for the amount
of his debt and for possession of the property conveyed by the deed.
Martin v. McNeely, 101-634.
Where there were two mortgages on a tract of land, and it was sold
first under the second mortgage, and afterwards under the first, and then
the interest of the purchaser at the sale under the first mortgage was sold
under execution, an action by the purchaser at the sale under the second
mortgage, against the purchaser at the execution sale, the purchaser at
the sale under the first mortgage, and the first mortgagee, alleging that
the first mortgage debt was paid, or nearly so, at the time of the sale
under that mortgage, and asking judgment, (1) for the possession of
the land if the debt had been paid, and if not ; (2) for an account of
the amount due on the first mortgage, and for the payment to him of
the excess of the purchase-money after paying the debt : It was held,
that the complaint was not multifarious, and a demurrer for misjoinder
of causes of action would be overruled. Heggie v. Hill, 95-303.
Legal and equitable causes of action. —Causes of action distinctly legal
and causes of action purely equitable may be united in one complaint,
if they have reference to the same subject matter and arise out of the
same transaction. It is not necessary, however, that they should be so
vjnited. Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93-38.
Actions of tort and in contract. —A cause of action founded on a tort,
cannot be united with one founded on a contract. Doughty v. Railroad,
78-22 ; Logan v. Wallis, 76-416.
Plaintiff's complaint contained two causes of action, one to recover
damages alleged to have been caused by the road-bed erected by defend
ant ponding water back on plaintiff's land ; the other to recover dam
ages for an alleged breach of duty on the part of defendant in not put
ting up sufficient cattle-guards as required by The Code, \ 1975, whereby
cattle trespassed upon plaintiff's enclosed lands and crops. On demur
rer held an improper joinder of causes of action, the first being for
injury to property, a tort, while the second arose "upon contract" for
the breach of an implied contract to perform a statutory duty and the
action should be divided. Hodges v. Railroad, 105-170.
Sec. 268. Allegation not denied, when to be deemed true.
C. C. P., s. 127.
Every material allegation of the complaint not contro
verted by the answer, and every material allegation of new
matter in the answer, constituting a counterclaim, not con
troverted by the reply, shall for the purposes of action be
taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in the
answer not relating to a counterclaim, or of new matter
in reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party
as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may
require.
Allegations of complaint not denied. —What is alleged in the complaint,
and not denied in the answer, is to be taken as admitted. Jenkins v.
Ore Dressing Co., 65-463; Stephenson v. Felton, 106-114; Harris v.
Sneeden, 104-369.
All facts averred in the complaint, and not controverted by the defend
ant, must be taken as true for the purposes of the action. Oates v.
Gray, 66-442.
Every allegation of the complaint not denied by the answer is admit
ted, and is as effectual as if found by a jury. Bonham v. Craig, 80-224.
Denials should be positive and unequivocal. —Denials and admissions and
statements of fact should be positive and unequivocal —not argumenta
tive or evasive. Rumbough v. Improvement Co., 106-461.
Counterclaim not denied. —Allegations of new matter constituting a
counterclaim are to be taken as true unless denied. McKesson v. Mendenhall, 64-286; Green v. Railroad, 77-95.
A defendant is entitled to judgment upon a counterclaim, if no reply
or demurrer has been interposed, although it would have been refused
if objection had been made in apt form and time. Rountree v. Britt,
94-104.
Allegations of answer, other than counterclaim, not denied.—Allegations of
new matter in the answer, not constituting a counterclaim or of new
matter in reply, are to be deemed controverted by general denial or
avoidance. Erwin v. Lowery, 64-321 ; Price v. Eccles, 73-162 ; Skinner
v. Wood, 76-109.
Where in an action for the settlement of a partnership, the defendant
admits the partnership, but alleges that there has been a complete set
tlement, with only specified exceptions, and there is no reply, the set
tlement must be taken as denied. Price v. Eccles, 73-162.
New matter set up in the answer, not relating to a counterclaim, is
taken to be controverted without further pleading. The court, however,
may require a formal reply to such new matter. The Code, \ 248; Fitz
gerald v. Shelton, 95-519.
Where the defendant in his answer commingles the facts which he
relies on both as ground for a rescission of the contract sued on by
plaintiff, and also for constituting a counterclaim : Held, that when
relied on as ground for rescission of the contract, these facts were
deemed to be denied without replication. Stanton v. Hughes, 97-318.
Denial of knowledge or information. —A denial of "any knowledge or
information sufficient to form a belief," is a sufficient denial to raise an
issue. Bank v. Charlotte, 75-45.
See \ 243 (1) and cases cited.
Action to recover land. —Where the court instructed the jury that the
plaintiffs had not offered sufficient evidence of possession to acquire
title—defendant having denied plaintiff's title—and the case on appeal
disclosed no such evidence ; there is not error, although the defendant
had, in its answer, deduced its title to a part of the land in controversy
from the plaintiffs—the defendant having averred a good title in itself.
Greenville v. Steamship Co., 104-91.
Admissions in another action. —Where in an action for false imprisonment,
the defendant admitted by not denying in his answer, that the warrant
of arrest under which the plaintiff was taken in custody was issued
before action was begun by issuing summons, such admission should be
taken as true in another action against same defendant, and any evidence
admitted on that point was irrelevant. Tucker v. Wilkins, 105-272.
Where in a former action on the same instrument the defendant did
not deny the allegation that the bond had not been paid, such admis
sion can be used in a subsequent trial as evidence to rebut presumption
of payment. Grant v. Gooch, 105-278.
In action for divorce. —Failure to deny complaint has no effect in action
for divorce. Steel v. Steel, 104-631.
In action of slander. —In an action for slander, an answer admitting
that the words were spoken, denying that they were spoken mali
ciously, alleging that the defendant believed the charge made by him
was true, and that the words were spoken more than six months before
suit brought, amounts, under our liberal system of pleading, to the pleas
of justification and the statute of limitation. Moore v. Edmiston,
70-510.
Legal proposition not established by admissions in pleadings. —A legal prop
osition cannot be established by admissions in the pleadings. Kelly v.
McCallum, S3-563.
Sec. 209. Material variance. C. C. P., 8. 12S.
No variance between the allegation in a pleading and
the proof shall be deemed material unless it has actually
misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining
his action upon the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged
that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has
been misled ; and thereupon the judge may order the
pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just.
Pleadings liberally construed. —Pleadings should be liberally construed,
with a view to substantial justice between the parties. Purcell v. Rail
road, 108-414; \ 260, ante, and cases cited.
Variance between summons and complaint. —A variance between summons
and complaint, in that the former is by the plaintiffs in their individual
capacity, while the latter sets up causes of action in behalf of said
plaintiffs " aud all others creditors and note-holders of the Bank of North
Carolina," and that the summons is against the defendants in their indi
vidual capacity, while the complaint sets out causes of action against them
as executors and stockholders, etc., is immaterial. "The only differ
ence," say the court, "between the practice tinder The Code and in the
court of equity is that, by The Code, the summons precedes instead of
following the complaint. In both courts its only office is to give notice
of an action begun, the parties to it, and where the complaint will be
filed." Wilsou v. Moore, 72-558.
Vagueness in complaint. —Where the description of the land sued for is
indefinite and vague, the court may allow an amendment. It is too late
to object to the description after verdict. Redmond v. Stepp, 100-212.
Variance between pleadings and proof. —There must be allegata aud pro
bata ; and, under the new system, as under the old, the court can take
no notice of any proof unless there be a corresponding allegation. The
court has a very wide discretion in reconciling the allegations with the
proof, but it has no more power than under the old system to hear proofs
without allegations. McKee v. Lineberger, 69-217.
Where the complaint alleges the delivery of a certain number of bricks
to the defendant, and the proof shows the delivery to and acceptance by
him of a larger number, the variance will not defeat a recovery. Brown
v. Morris, 83-251.
A variance between allegation and proof is immaterial in a civil action,
unless the adverse party has been misled. Lilly v. Baker, SS-151; Pat
rick v. Railroad, 93-422; Lawrence v. Hester, 93-79; Usry v. Suit, 91-406.
A variance arises where the proofs do not sustain the cause of action
alleged in the complaint. If it is immaterial, it will be disregarded; if
material and misleading, the Court may, in its discretion, allow an
amendment, upon just terms; but where the evidence relates to a cause
of action entirely different from that stated in the complaint, it is not a
case of variance at all, and it was never intended by The Code to allow
a plaintiff to prove a cause of action which he has not alleged. Anthony
v. Seagle, 98-553; Willis v. Branch, 94-142.
The evidence introduced by the plaintiffmust conform to his allegations.
So, where, in his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was seized of
certain lands in fee, and the evideuce showed that he was only entitled
to a life-estate, he is not entitled to recover in this state of the pleadiugs.
Brittain v. Daniels, 94-7S1.
Where a variance is not merely formal, but lies at the very root of the
cause of action, it is fatal to the plaintiff's right to recover. Pendleton
v. Dalton, 96-507.
It is error to permit proof without corresponding allegation. If a
defence set up in the answer is abandoned for want of proof, it is error
to admit proof of another defence not pleaded but suggested ore tentts.
McLaurin v. Cronly, 90-50.
The power of the court to allow amendments, so as to fit the complaint
to the evidence, is too well settled to require discussion or citation of
authority. Spivey v. Grant, 96-214.
The court may give such relief as the proof and pleadings render
appropriate, though not demanded in the complaint, and, to that end,
may order the pleadings reformed to correspond with the proof. Barnes
v. Barnes, 104-613.
Semble, that this section cures variances between pleadings and proof,
where the defendant in ejectment relies upon a different title from the
one set up in the answer. Keathley v. Branch, S8-379.
A different cause of action. —No amendment of pleadings will be permit
ted where the proof establishes a cause of action wholly different from
that alleged in the complaint. Carpenter v. Huffsteller, 87-273; Grant
v. Burgwyn, 88-95; Kron v. Smith, 96-389.
Amendments liberally allowed. —Amendments to pleadings which further
justice, speed the trial of causes, or prevent circuity of action and unnec
essary expense, should be liberally allowed, on proper terms. Commis
sioners v. Blair, 76-136.
Motion to amend before trial. —Sections 269 to 277 point out how amend
ments shall be made, the obvious purpose being that parties shall apply
to the court in apt time, prior to the trial, to amend the pleadings in all
the particulars objected to, and that they may not be allowed at the trial
to spring objections to the form or effect of the charge or defence.
Moore v. Edmiston, 70-510.
Amendment during trial. —The judge, on the trial, may direct the find
ings according to the evidence, and amend the pleadings accordingly.
Gibbs v. Fuller, 66-116.
After anBwer. —When the answer showed that the defendant had not
been misled by the defects of the complaint, a motion to dismiss for such
defect, discovered after answer, will not be allowed. Garrett v. Trotter,
65-43°After sustaining demurrer for defect. —An amendment, in order to insert
omitted allegations or parties, may be allowed, even after a demurrer to
the complaint for the defect has been sustained. Reynolds v. Smathers,
87-24; Johnson v. Finch, 93-205.
Amendment not necessary. —Where the complaint sets out a special con
tract, which fails, the plaintiff can proceed with the case and recover
his damages, as on the common counts in assumpsit, without any amend
ment of the pleadings. Jones v. Mial, 82-252; Stokes v. Taylor, 104-394.
Amendment allowed,—A plaintiff may sue for a horse and recover a cow,
but, in order to do this, when the variance appears he must obtain leave
to amend. Judgment cannot be rendered on a state of facts not alleged
in the complaint and inconsistent therewith. Shelton v. Davis, 69-324.
In an action for slander, when the complaint alleges the slanderous
words to have been uttered at a specific time and place, the plaintiff may
prove the words to have been spoken at a different time and place; but,
if the defendant shall have been misled by such allegation, and has not
set up the statute of limitation in consequence, the court will allow him
to amend and put in that, defence. Pegram v. Stoltz, 67-144.
In an action for claim and delivery, if the proof shows that the defend
ant had sold the property before action brought, the plaintiff should be
allowed to amend the complaint, without costs, and to ask judgment for
the value of the property ; but he could not recover without such amend
ment. Haughton v. Newberry, 69-456; Webb v. Taylor, 80-305.
The courts have inherent power to allow amendments to pleadings,
independent of The Code, which they may allow in their discretion,
unless prohibited by some statute, or unless some vested right will be
disturbed. Knott v. Taylor, 96-553.
The affidavit in a bastardy proceeding may be amended in the superior
court, with the permission of the judge, and there is nothing in the
point that such amendments cannot be made after the defects are pointed
out by a motion to dismiss. State v. Giles, 103-391.
Amendment discretionary.—The refusal by the judge below to permit an
amendment, is unreviewable. Blackwell v. Dibbrell, 103-270.
Defect in name of a party. —Where there is a defect in the name of a
defendant in the summons, it is cured by the judgment, and if there is
an appeal, it is the duty of the upper court to amend. Clawson v.
Wolfe, 77-100.
Judge can reform pleadings ex mero motn, —A judge can order reformation
of pleadings ex mero motu. Turner v. Cuthrell, 94-239 ; Buie v. Brown,
104-535 ; McKinnon v. McIntosh, 98-89, overruling Ten Broeck v. Or
chard, 79-518. See \ 261, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 270. 1mmaterial variance. C. C. P., 8. 129.
Where the variance is not material, as provided in the
preceding section, the judge may direct the fact to be found
according to the evidence, or may order an immediate
amendment without costs.
Variance immaterial. —No variance between allegation and proof is
material, unless it actually misleads the adverse party : hence, when the
complaint was upon a bond for $550, or thereabouts, and the bond pro
duced in evidence was for $549, this was held immaterial. Usry v. Suit,
91-406.
If the answer contains, by fair construction, an admission of the
material averments, which should have been made in the complaint, or
proceeds on the presumption that they have been sufficiently made, and
denies them, the variance is immaterial. Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59.
Waiver. —Where, on the trial below, the defendant's counsel alleged
that there was a variance, but made no answer when asked by the court
if he had been misled thereby : Held, such variance, if any, is thereby
rendered immaterial. Morgan v. Bank, 93-352.
Misuomer.—A misnomer of a corporate body, when the parties intended
the corporate name, is not material, and the true name can be shown
by evidence. Ryan v. Martin, 91-464.
See cases cited under preceding section.
Sec. 271. A failure of proof, when. C. C. P., s. 130.
Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action
or defence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not
in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire
scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance
within the preceding section, but a failure of proof.
Total failure of proof. —Where the case, as alleged in the complaint, is
wholly unproved and a different state of facts is proved, it is not an im
material variance, but a failure of proof. Carpenter v. Huffsteller, 87273; Grant v. Burgwyn, 88-95.
Where the answer alleged as a counterclaim that the note sued on was
endorsed to the plaintiff after maturity, and that the endorser was
indebted to the defendant before the transfer of the note, for money
paid by him as his surety, and the evidence offered to support it was a
joint and several note, executed by the defendant and another party, who,
it is alleged, was the agent of the endorser of the plaintiff, but nothing
in the note offered in evidence showed any agency, there was a failure
of proof, and the court below properly charged the jury that there was
no evidence to support the allegation of the counterclaim. Smith v.
McGregor, 96-101.
See, also, cases cited under \ 269, ante.
Sec. 272. Amendments of course after allowance of demur
rer. C. C. P., 8. 131. 1871-2, c. 173. 8. 1.
Any pleading may be once amended of course, without
costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had,
at any time before the period for answering it expires ; or
it can be so amended at any time, unless it be made to
appear to the court that it was done for the purpose of delay,
and the plaintiff or defendant will thereby lose the benefit
of a term for which the cause is, or may be, docketed for
trial; and if it appear to the court or judge that such
amendment was made for such purpose, the same may be
stricken out, and such terms imposed as to the court or
judge may seem just. After the decision of a demurrer,
the judge shall, if it appear that the demurrer was inter
posed in good faith, allow the party to plead over upon
such terms as may be just. If the demurrer be allowed
for the reason that several causes of action have been im
properly united, the judge shall, upon such terms as may
be just, order the action to be divided into as many actions
as may be necessary to the proper determination of the
causes of action therein mentioned.
Jndgment upon overruling demurrer.—The opposing party is entitled to
judgment on the overruling of a demurrer, unless the judge, in his discre
tion, grant leave to the party to plead over. Ransom v. McClees, 64-17;
Merwin v. Ballard, 65-168; Love v. Com'rs, 64-706; Walsh v. Hall,
66-233 ; Wilson v. Moore, 72-558.
Since act 1871-2, ch. 173, amending this section. —Since the act of i87i-'2,
amending this section, the defendant has a right to answer over on the
overruling of the demurrer. Moore v. Hobbs, 77-65.
The defendant has the right to put in an answer after the overruling
of a demurrer, if it appears that the demurrer was interposed in good
faith. Bronson v. Insurance Co., 85-411.
Where a demurrer was overruled in the court below with leave to the
defendant to answer over, and to plaintiff to amend complaint, although
the demurrer is sustained on appeal, yet no final judgment will be entered
in the case, but it will be remanded for further proceeding in the court
below, under the leave granted. Morris v. Gentry, 89-248.
If demurrer is frivolous. —But when the demurrer is frivolous, the mat
ter is entirely in the discretion of the court. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273 ;
Cowan v. Baird, 77-201.
Demurrer sustained.—Where a demurrer for want of parties is sustained,
an amendment making the additional parties is proper. Reynolds v.
Smathers, 87-24; or, for other defect, Johnson v. Finch, 93-205.
Demurrer that plaintiff cannot maintain action. —-Where a demurrer that
the plaintiff is not the proper party to bring the action is sustained, the
action must be dismissed. Jones v. McKinnon, 87-294.
Court may order action divided. —Under this section an action containing
a cause of action founded on tort and one founded on contract, can, on
motion, be divided in the superior court, but not in the supreme court.
Doughty v. Railroad Co., 78-22.
Where two causes of action are improperly joined, the court may order
the action to be divided. Street v. Tuck, 84-605 ; Finch v. Baskerville,
S5-205 ; Hodges v. Railroad, 105-170.
But not when there is misjoinder of parties.—The provision of this section,
authorizing the court to direct a division of improperly joined causes of
action, does not extend to the cases where there is also a misjoinder of
parties to the action. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 96-14.
May be divided in the discretion of the court. —Where several defendants
are sued as trespassing on land, the court, in its discretion, may order
the action divided. It is not a right that parties can claim. Bryan v.
Spivey, 106-95.
Where the causes of action cannot be divided. —Where the several sup
posed causes of action cannot be divided and separately pursued, the
complaint cannot be obnoxious for duplicity England v. Garner, 86-366.
Demurrer sustained, plaintiff should pay costs. —When a demurrer of the
defendant is sustained, the plaintiff should pay the costs, and then it is
in the discretian of the court if they shall be allowed to amend. Netherton v. Candler, 78-88. See Bronson v. Ins. Co., 85-411, cited above.
Affidavit in attachment amended. —The court can allow the amendment
of an affidavit upon which a warrant of attachment is issued, although
the former affidavit is wholly insufficint. Brown v. Hawkins, 65-645.
Defective statement of a cause of action. —There is a wide difference
between a defective statement of a cause of action and a statement of a
defective cause of action. If, at any time, it may appear that the court
has no jurisdiction, or the plaintiff no cause of action, the court may stop
the proceedings and dismiss the action. If, however, there is merely a
defective statement of a cause of action, this cannot be done. Garrett
v. Trotter, 65-430.
Amendment after verdict. —Where a complaint fails to allege the assign
ment of the notes sued on, an amendment to that effect will be allowed
after verdict. Pearce v. Mason, 78-37.
The superior and criminal courts have power to amend any warrant,
process, pleading or proceeding begun before a justice of the peace,
even after verdict and judgment ; but where such amendment is made
after verdict, it should be in conformity with evidence elicited on the
trial. The Code, §908; State v. Baker, 106-758.
Amendment to show jurisdiction. —While consent may not give jurisdic
tion generally, when a complaint does not show jurisdiction as to par
ties and subject-matter, the parties can consent to an amendment whereby
such jurisdiction does appear. It seems that the court has power to
allow such amendment without consent of defendant. Planing Mills v.
McNiuch, 99-517.
Causes of action arising prior to C. C. P. —This section has no application
to actions brought upon causes of action arising prior to the adoptiou of
The Code. Matthews v. Copeland, 80-30.
Note. —The exemptions from the C. C. P. system seem repealed by
The Code of 1883 in every instance except as regards the statute of limita
tions.
Sec. 273. Amendments by order. C. C. P., ». 132.
The judge or court may, before and after judgment, in
furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading, process or proceeding, by adding or
striking out the name of any party ; or by correcting a mis
take in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect ; or by inserting other allegations material to the
case ; or when the amendment does not change substan
tially the claim or defence, by conforming the pleading or
proceeding to the facts proved.
Amendments liberally allowed. —Amendments to pleadings, which further
justice, speed the trial of causes, or prevent unnecessary circuity of
action and unnecessary expense, should be liberally allowed on proper
terms. Com'rs v. Blair, 76-136.
Large liberty of amendment allowable. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430 ;
Wilson v. Moore, 72-558.
The distinguishing feature of the practice introduced by The Code, is
to have actions tried on their real merits, and avert a failure of justice
from any defect that can be remedied by amendment, without prejudice
to the other party. Kron v. Smith, 96-389.
Amendment discretionary and not appealable. —Allowing or refusing
amendments to pleadings is discretionary matter, and not reviewable on
appeal. Henry v. Cannon, 86-24; Wiggins v. McCoy, 87-499; Gill v.
Young, 8S-58.
The superior courts possess, independent of the C. C. P., an inherent
discretionary right to amend pleadings, or to allow them to Tie filed at any
time, unless prohibited by some statute, or unless vested rights are inter
fered with. Gilchrist v. Kitchen, 86-20.
Where the plaintiff voluntarily amends his complaint by entering a
nol. pros, as to certain causes of action, it is a matter of discretion in the
court whether he shall be allowed to reinstate them. Grant v. Burgwyn, 88-95.
The refusal of the subordinate courts to allow additional pleadings to
be filed, or original pleadings to be amended, is not reviewable upon
appeal; Warden v. McKinnon, 99-25; Boddie v. Woodard, 83-2; Reese
v. Jones, 84-597 ; Bank v. McElwee, 104-305; or to strike out name of a
party. Jarrett v. Gibbs, 107-303
An amendment of pleading is ordinarily left to the discretion of the
presiding judge ; but where it is of such a nature as renders a corre
sponding amendment necessary on the part of the adverse party, a refusal
to allow the latter is appealable. Brooks v. Brooks, 90-142.
Terms of amendment discretionary..—When the superior court has power
to grant leave to amend, the question of the terms on which it may be
done, is entirely within the discretion of the judge. Robinson v. Willoughby, 67-84.
Amendment of summons. —It is error for a court to refuse to amend a
summons upon the ground of want of power. Whether the amendment
should be allowed is discretionary, and not reviewable. Henderson v.
Graham, 84-496 ; Jackson v. McLean, 90-64.
Where a summons was returnable, and the complaint and answer
were filed before the clerk (July, 1869), who transferred the case to
the civil issue docket at the next term, and the names of counsel were
marked thereon : Held, that at spring term, 1870, it was competent
for the court to amend the summons by making it returnable to the
term, in accordance with the act of i86S-'69, ch. 76. Thomas v. Womack, 64-657 ; Chatham v. Crews, 81-343.
Amendment substituting parties. —When a lessor, during the continuance
of a lease, conveys by deed to a third person, and an action is after
wards brought for the rent by the lessor, the court has the power to
substitute the assignee as plaintiff, in his stead. Bullard v. Johnson,
65-436.
An action in the name of an individual may be changed by amend
ment into an action by the firm of which he is a member. Martin v.
Young, 85-156.
An amendment which permits a change and substitution of plaintiffs
is allowable. Reynolds v. Smathers, 87-24.
An objection in the supreme court that the action on an administra
tion bond was not brought in the name of the state may be obviated by
a motion to amend, under 'i 965 of The Code ; but, under the circum
stances of this case, on terms that plaintiffs pay all costs. Wilson v.
Pearson, 102-290.
Where an action is brought by "A on relation of the state " against
the sheriff and his sureties on his official bond, the court can allow an
amendment striking out the state as plaintiff and the sureties as defend
ants. Magg^ett v. Roberts, 108-174, and this can be done after verdict.
Brown v. Mitchell, 102-347.
Where it is desirable or necessary to continue the action as to some,
and discontinue it as to the other plaintiffs, the proper course is to per
mit or order a withdrawal of those who go out. Lafoon v. Shearin,
95-391The court, in its discretion, may allow the motion of one of several
plaintiffs to strike out his name, and the exercise of such discretion,
whether by refusing or granting the motion, is not reviewable. Jarrett
v. Gibbs, 107-303.
The court could allow an amendment making another party a defend
ant either with his consent or by service of such amended summons
upon him. Plemmons v. Improvement Co., 108-614.
Additional parties. —A creditor, ignorant of proceedings to distribute a
fund, may come in and prove his claim after the time limited for pre
senting demands. Bank of Washington v. Creditors, 80-9 ; Glenn v.
Farmers' Bank, 80-97.
Additional parties defendant can be made by amendment. Isler v.
Koonce, 83-55.
The court has no power to convert a pending action that cannot be
maintained, into a new one, by admitting a new party plaintiff, who is
solely interested, and allowing him to assign a new cause of action.
Merrill v. Merrill, 92-657.
Appearance. —An appearance is general unless a special appearance is
duly entered, but if there is a failure by inadvertence merely to enter
the appearance as special, the court may allow the entry to be corrected.
Suiter v. Brittle, 90-19.
Changing nature of action. —In an action for possession of land based on
a deed absolute on its face, but which was held on appeal to be a mort
gage, and a new trial granted : Held, that upon such trial the court
might allow amendment so as to demand a foreclosure instead of pos
session. Robinson v. Willoughby, 67-84.
Queere, whether an action ex delicto can be amended into an action
ex contractu. Foster v. Penry, 76-131.

different from the one alleged in the complaint. Carpenter v. Huffsteller, S7-273 ; Grant v. Burgwyn, 88-95.
The court has no power, with or without amendment, to convert an
action brought for the purpose of obtaining an injunction into one for
a mandamus. McNair v. Commissioners, 93-364.
The court cannot, except by consent, allow an amendment which
changes the pleadings so as to make substantially a new action, but
an amendment which only adds to the original cause of action is not of
this nature, and may be allowed. Ely v. Early, 94-1.
The court has no power, except by consent, to allow amendments
either in respect to parties or the cause of action, which will make sub
stantially a new action, as this would not be to allow an amendment,
but to substitute a new action for the one pending. Richards v. Smith,
98-500 ; Kron v. Smith, 96-389 ; Clendenin v. Turner, 96-416.
Where the cause of action set out in the complaint was to recover
land descended to the plaintiff from her father, the court has no power
to allow an amendment at the trial so as to allow the plaintiff to claim
a different interest as heir of her sister, as this would be not an amend
ment, but substantially bringing a new suit. Robbins v. Harris, 96-557.
Amendments not allowed. —Amendments are not allowed when the effect
is to deprive the other party of defences which would be available against
a new action. Christmas v. Mitchell, 38-535; Cogdell v. Exum, 69-464;
Henderson v. Graham, 84-496; Gill v. Young, 88-56.
An amendment will not be allowed when its effect would be to evade
or defeat the provisions of a statute. Patterson v. Wadsworth, 94-538.
An amendment which introduces a cause of action which arose after
the action was begun cannot be permitted. So, where a submission to
arbitration of the matters in controversy in a pending action was made
by agreement in pais, the plaintiff cannot amend his complaint so as to
declare on the award which has since been filed in his favor. Jackson v.
McLean, 96-474.
The complaint cannot be amended to allege a cause of action accruing
subsequently to the beginning of the action, nor to make an entirely dif
ferent action. Powell v. Allen, 103-46.

tains matter to which a former answer was not responsive, or a new
defendant was brought in, leave to file an answer to meet the change
cannot be refused. Gill v. Young, 88-56; Brooks v. Brooks, 90-142.
A radical amendment entitles the other side to a mistrial. March v.
Verble, 79-19.
Amendments allowed. —Where the affidavit upon which supplementary
proceedings issued is insufficient, it can be amended. It is otherwise as
to affidavits upon which an attachment, injunction or arrest has been
granted. Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65.
The clerk may allow amendment in warrant of attachment. Cushing
v. Styron, 104-338; Brown v. Hawkins, 65-645.
In an action to recover land, the court may allow an amendment so as
to set up a mistake in a deed. Ely v. Early, 94-1.
In proceedings for divorce the allegations may be ameuded. Jackson
v. Jackson, 105-433.
Amendment out of term. —Qtuere, whether an amendment can be made
out of term, making an additional party and directing summons to issue.
Young v. Rollins, 90-134.
Amendment on affidavit.—Where an amendment was allowed which could
only be done upon affidavit, and the record is silent as to whether an
affidavit was filed or not, the affidavit is presumed to have been filed,
upon the ground that that which is not shown to be wrong is presumed
to be right. Patterson v. Wadsworth, 94-538.
Limitations rnn till amendment.—Where the plaintiff brought an action
for slander more than six months after the cause accrued, and then after
wards amended his complaint so as to include words spoken within six
months before the beginning of the action, but more than eighteen before
the filing of the amended complaint, and the defendant pleaded the
statute of limitations: Held, (1 ) the plaintiff was barred; (a) the amended
complaint set up a new cause of action, and this was also barred. Hes
ter v. Mullen, 107-731.
Before the clerk. —Under this section, the clerk has the same power of
amendment in cases before him. Maxwell v. Blair, 95-317; Cushing v.
Styron, 104-33S.
Conditional amendment; terms broken. —Where leave is given a defend
ant to file an amended answer, provided no matter be set up therein
which will affect orders previously made in the cause, such amended
answer will be stricken out if it be not compatible with the terms upon
which leave was granted. The motion to strike out the answer was
made in apt time under the facts in this case.
Amendment during trial. —When the court can perceive that the oppos
ing party has not been misled by a defect in the pleading, an amend
ment should be allowed on the trial. Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430.
An endorsement in blank of negotiable paper should be filled by order
of the court before judgment ; if not done, it may be done afterwards by
the court under this section. Lilly v. Baker, 88-151.
Certainty of pleading not relaxed. —The certainty of pleading is not
relaxed by allowing amendment so as to conform the pleading to the facts
as proven. The judgment must conform to the pleadings as well as to the
facts. Haughton v. Newberry, 69-456.
When a petition to sell land describes a certain tract which was sold,
and afterward it was attempted to be shown that another tract was
intended to have been embraced in the petition, and was actually sold
under the order of sale, and an order was asked to amend the proceed
ings in accordance with the said claim, the court had no power to make
such amendment. Stafford v. Harris, 72-198.
Amendment after judgment. —The judge has power to amend after judg
ment. Penny v. .Smith, 61-35.
The judge's discretion to amend after judgment cannot be reviewed.
Lippard v. Roseman, 72-427 ; Dobson v. Chambers, 78-334.
When one creditor obtains a judgment and begins supplemental pro
ceedings, it is error to amend the proceedings so as to allow other cred
itors to make themselves parties, except by consent. Righton v. Pruden,
73-61.
After verdict, a plaintiff who failed to allege an assignment to him of
the notes sued on (the defendant in his answer alleging it) would be
allowed to amend by setting up the assignment. Pearce v. Mason, 78-37.
An informal judgment can be amended after the lapse of a year. Farmer
v. Willard, 75-401 ; Wall v. Covington, 83-144.
Where the trial judge allowed an amendment after verdict, but stated
to opposing counsel that if they would show by affidavit that the defend
ant had any evidence to offer to the complaint as amended, which had
not been already offered, that he would either refuse to allow the amend
ment, or would set aside the verdict, it cured any possible error. It is
intimated that allowing amendments after, as well as before verdict, is
discretionary with the trial judge. Morgan v. Smith, 95-396.
Under the provisions of The Code, the courts have the power, both
before and after judgment, to allow amendments to the pleadings, when
they do not substantially change the cause of action or defence. Knott
v. Taylor, 96-553 ; Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
Except upon an application to rehear, or because of " mistake, inad
vertence, surprise or excusable neglect," as provided by statute, the
supreme court has no power to amend its regular judgment, regularly
entered, at a preceding term, but it can amend a judgment improperlv
entered, or enter one which was not entered, or not properly entered",
at a former term, when the court intended aud ought to have entered it.
Cook v. Moore, 100-294.
Amendment of execution. —The superior court has no power to amend
an execution, so as to divest the right of an innocent purchaser at sher
iff's sale therennder. Williams v. Sharpe, 70-582.
Amendment of the record ; findings of fact. —On a motion to amend the
records of a court, the facts found by the judge are conclusive in an
appeal to the supreme court. Upon such motion strict proof will be
required, especially when the rights of minors are involved. Murrill v.
Humphrey, 76-414.
A court can always amend its records so as to make them speak the
truth. Perry v. Adams, 83-266 ; State v. Swepson, 83-584 ; State v. Pool,
It is the duty of every court to amend its records, if erroneous, to
make them speak the truth, regardless of the consequences to parties,
to third persons and of the'lapse of time. Walton v. Pearson, 85-34.
Semble, an absolute order to amend the record has the legal effect of
an actual amendment. Ibid.
If a judge mistakes his powers or otherwise errs in amending the
record of a case, the only remedy is by appeal. Another judge of the
superior court, and in another cause, certainly cannot reverse an order
to amend the record of a case. Ibid.
The power of a court to amend its records at a subsequent term is
essential, and such amendment should not be made by simply noting
the order to amend, but it should be actually made by correcting the
minutes of the former term. McDowell v. McDowell, 92-227.
A judge has the power to amend a record, so as to make it speak the
truth, at any time ; and, by consent of parties, he may hear the evidence
for that purpose, and make the order of amendment in a county other
than that where the record is. Brooks v. Stephens, 100-297.
The court will not allow amendments to be made in its records, par
ticularly after a long lapse of time, unless the proofs offered in sup
port thereof are strong and convincing. —Walton v. McKesson, 101-42S.

the truth even after a motion in arrest of judgment, even if such altera
tion removes the grounds for the motion. State v. Bordeaux, 93-560.
After final judgment disposing of the rights of the parties, it is too
late to introduce a new cause of action into the controversy. Brendle
v. Herren, 97-257.
Though a judge has the right to amend the record in the court below
so as to make it speak the truth, he has no power to make any amend
ment that would affect the records of the supreme court ; an appeal
from a judgment in an action against an administrator, begun before
1S69, having resulted in a judgment absolute in this court, conclusively
fixes him with assets. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
After amendment, too late to object. —Though no sufficient cause of action
was set forth against defendant in the original complaint, the general
purpose of the action appearing, he cannot be heard to complain after
amendment without objection by him. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290
Amendment of records at chambers. —Our superior courts are always open
for the transaction of business, and the judges of those courts have a
right to hear and determine questions of amending records at chambers,
as well as in term time. Falkner v. Hunt, 68-475.
Does not apply to amendments after trial. —This section has an applica
tion only to amendments made before or at the trial, and not at a time
subsequent. Askew v. Capehart, 79-17.
Amendment must be by the same court. —An amendment of a judgment
or order can only be made in the court where it was rendered. Adams
v. Reeves, 76-412; Morton v. Rippy, 84-611.
Pending appeal to supreme court. —When an appeal is taken from the
superior court to the supreme court, the whole case is taken up ; so that
a proceeding for a new trial on account of newly discovered evidence
cannot be instituted in the superior court pending such appeal. Bledsoe
v. Nixon, 69-81.
In appeals from probate
probate
court to the superior court, the judge has the same right to allow
amendments as if the case had begun in his court. Sudderth v. McCombs
Where a complaint in an action begun before the clerk, as probate
court, states matters properly triable in that court, an amendment can
not be allowed in the superior court engrafting matters of which the
latter court alone has jurisdiction. Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
Where, however, an action properly cognizable in the superior court
gets there by appeal, having been improperly brought before the clerk,
the court will amend the summons and proceedings and treat the case
as if originally brought in the superior court. Capps v. Capps, 85-408 ;
Finch v. Baskerville, 85-205.
In appeals from a justice. —The superior court has power to amend a
warrant issued against a person by a justice of the peace for failure to
work the public road, by inserting "the state" as plaintiff, instead of
the overseer. State v. Cauble, 70-62.
In an appeal from a justices' judgment, it is in the discretion of the
judge presiding to allow amendment of any plea before the justice, or
the substitution of new ones, upon such terms as may be just. Hinton
v. Deans, 75-18.
The defendant on an appeal may be allowed, in the superior court,
to file a plea which he had been refused permission to do before the
justice. Lane v. Morton, 78-7.
Or to amend his answer to make.it what he intended it to be before
the justice of the peace. Heyer v. Beatty, 76-28.

the judge of the superior court can allow the pleadings to be perfected
in his court. Faison v. Johnson, 78-78.

after an appeal from a justice's judgment, is discretionary with the
judge. Johnson v. Rowland, 8o-i ; Thomas v. Simpson, 80-4.
The superior court, on sufficient proof, can amend the record of an
appeal from a justice, so as to make it speak the truth. Bank v.
McArthur, 82-107.
An amendment of summons in the superior court, that would, if
made in the justice's court, have given the justice jurisdiction, should
be refused. Allen v. Jackson, 86-321.
When, however, it is made to appear that a justice of the peace would
have had jurisdiction if the summons had contained the proper allega
tion, but it was omitted by mistake or inadvertence, the court may,
pending the action, permit the necessary amendment. Leathers -v.
Morris, 101-184.
See \ 908 of The Code.
Sec. 274. Relief in case of mistake, surprise or excusable
neglect. C. C. P., s. 133.
The judge may likewise, in his discretion, and upon such
terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made,
or other act to be done, after the time limited, or by an
order to enlarge such time ; and may also, in his discretion,
and upon such terms as may be just, at any time within
one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judg
ment, order or other proceeding taken against him through
his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,
and may supply an omission in any proceeding ; and when
ever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any
respect to this Code, the judge may, in like manner and
upon like terms, permit an amendment of such proceeding,
so as to make it conformable thereto.
Extension of time to file pleadings discretionary. —The enlargement of
time to file pleadings, and the granting or refusing leave to do any act
out of its proper time, is a matter purely in the discretion of the court
below, and cannot be reviewed on appeal. Austin v. Clarke, 70-458;
Gilchrist v. Kitchen, 86-20.
It is discretionary with the court to allow a pleading to be filed after
the period within which it should have been filed, and to attach condi
tions or limitations to the matters which may be set up in such pleading.
Mallard v. Patterson, 10S-255.
Extension of time not encouraged. —While the courts have the discretion,
they should not encourage the practice of permitting pleadings to be
filed at periods subsequent to the term, when in the regular course of the
action they should have been filed, as it is calculated to produce delay,
confusion and dissatisfaction. Denipsy v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Amendment of pleadings discretionary. —A defect in a complaint is not
cured by a verdict, if such defect is the total omission of an important
allegation, but an amendment could be allowed after verdict. Pearce
v. Mason, 78-37.
The judge has a discretionary power to allow or refuse amendments
to pleadings. Henry v. Cannon, 86-24.
See II 269, 270, 272 and 273, ante, and cases cited.

and be allowed to plead on account of excusable neglect, under this sec
tion, is addressed to the discretion of the presiding judge, whose deci
sion is not subject to review. Simonton v. Lanier, 71-498.
The action of the judge of the superior court, upon such an applica
tion is not reviewable, unless it appears that he has abused his legal dis
cretion, which he does not do by refusing to set aside a judgment, when
the application does not disclose any meritorious defence to the action.
Bank v. Foote, 77-131.
The exercise of the discretion conferred upon the judge, to whom an
application to vacate a judgment is made, by The Code, \ 274, cannot be
reviewed on appeal. Brown v. Hale, 93-188.
Where a motion to vacate a judgment under this section is denied
in the exercise of the discretion of the court, the supreme court will not
review the judgment. Albertsou v. Terry, 108-75.
Judgment set aside within one year. —When a judgment was rendered
against a defendant in a justice's court, and on appeal affirmed in the
superior court, he making no defence, and more than a year afterwards,
the judgment was set aside for want of notice, the judge had no power to
make such order. McDaniel v. Watkins, 76-399.
Under this section, a motion made after the expiration of a year, to
set aside a judgmeut, cannot be allowed. Mabry v. Erwin, 78-45

ment, must be made within one year after rendition of such judgment.
Askew v. Capehart, 79-17.

Want of power. —If a judge refuses to entertain a motion to set aside a
judgment for any of the causes mentioned in this section, on the ground
that he has no power to grant it, it is error, and is reviewable on appeal.
Hudgins v. White, 65-393 ; Winslow v. Alexander, 19-9 ; State v. Locust,
63-574 ; Gilchrist v. Kitchen, 86-20.
Excusable neglect. —A judgment by default against a party who has
employed an attorney to enter his pleas, and such attorney has neglected
to do so, is a surprise within the meaning of this section ; and the neglect
of the party to examine the docket, and see that his pleas are in, is an
excusable neglect. Griel v. Vernon, 65-76.
It is proper to set aside a judgment for a want of answer, rendered,
after the defendant and his counsel had left the court, at a term previous.
Deal v. Palmer, 68-215.
The fact that an order which, in effect, deprived the plaintiff of a right
of appeal, was made in a cause at midnight, when the plaintiff was
absent and had no reason to believe the court was in session, nor that
his counsel was unable to attend the trial, constitutes "excusable neg
lect," and entitles him to have such order set aside. Long v. Cole,
A decree confirming a sale for partition, will be set aside for accident,
mistake, or surprise. Blue v. Blue, 79-69.
When defendant's counsel had not been informed of the nature of the
defence, by reason of illness of defendant, and had consented to the judg
ment, supposing it to be understood by the defendant, who had a meri
torious defence, it constitutes excusable neglect, and the judgment
should be set aside. Mebane v. Mebane, 80-34.
Where the defendant twice requested the clerk to enter on the docket
the name of his attorney, which he promised to do, and the attorney
himself applied to the clerk to examine the plaintiff's complaint, but
was unable to see it, and the balance of the term was absent as a wit
ness under subpcena, this was such a case of excusable neglect as enti
tles the defendant to have a judgment taken by default set aside. Wynne
v. Prairie, 86-73.
Where the defendant employed counsel, attended court, and at the
instance of his counsel had gone home to attend his official duties, who
assured him that everything had been done to protect him, and the judg, ment was entered in the absence of himself and his counsel, and with
out evidence upon the matters controverted in the pleadings, this pre
sents a case of excusable negligence. Francks v. Sutton, 86-78.
Where counsel enters an appearance, but fails to file an answer, the
party litigant, if in no default himself, is entitled to relief against a
judgment taken by default. Geer v. Reams, 88-197.
Where an order was made by the court that no civil business would be
taken up at that term, and counsel left court on account of illness of his
family, but, on last day of the term, judgment by default was entered
because defendant's demurrer, previously filed, was not found in the
papers, the judgment so entered was properly set aside on the ground
of excusable neglect. Pickens v. Fox, 90-369.
Where a judge made a general order, giving parties time to file plead
ings, but, after leaving the court-house for the term, made an order that
plaintiffs desiring judgments for want of an answer should note on the
docket that answers must be filed, a judgment for want of an answer
under such circumstances will be set aside for excusable neglect. Branch
v. Walker, 92-87.
The court refused to extend time to file an answer, and signed judg
ment, but stated if an answer were filed before 12 o'clock night of the
last day of the term, the judgment would be stricken out. The answer
was filed within that time, but the judgment was not stricken out. This
was excusable neglect. Quart, whether defendant has until that time
to answer. Warren v. Harvey, 92-137.
When notice had been issued to the purchasers at a judicial sale to
appear at a term of the court and show cause why the deeds theretofore
made them by the commissioners appointed to make the sale should not
be set aside and a re-sale directed, appeared as notified, and were
informed by one of the commissioners, who was also the attorney of the
plaintiffs in the action, that no judgment would then be asked against
them, and that he was satisfied the matter would be satisfactorily arranged
before the next term, and the other commissioner assured them that it was
entirely unnecessary for them to employ counsel; that they were igno
rant persons; that they relied upon these statements and took no further
steps to answer the motion; and, at the next term, without their knowl
edge or consent, a decree was signed, but not entered on the minutes,
allowing the motion: Hid to constitute such excusable neglect as would
justify the court in setting aside the judgment. Weil v. Woodard, 104-94.
In the progress of a cause, an order was entered, upon motion of
defendant, to make another person party defendant, and a summons was
issued and served upon such person in accordance with the order. The
person so served did not, however, read or hear read the summons, and
was unaware of the order making him party, but supposed he was sum
moned as a witness, in which capacity he attended the trial and was
examined. He learned, then, that he had been made a party and judg
ment had been rendered against him for want of an answer: Held, that
the judge committed no error in setting aside the judgment upon the
ground of excusable neglect. Holden v. Purifoy, 108-163.
Inexcusable neglect. —Failure of a party to attend court because he knew,
personally, nothing about the action and supposed that a witness who
had been duly summoned would attend, is not "excusable neglect."
Waddell v. Wood, 64-624; Cobb v. O'Hagan, 81-293.
Where the excusable neglect alleged as ground for vacating a judg
ment is that the counsel has misinformed the party as to the time of
holding the court, whereby he failed to file an answer, this is insufficient
if it appear the defendant did not suffer harm thereby. Clegg v. Soapstone Co., 67-302.
The fact that a defendant supposed a summons which was served on
him by delivery of a copy to be a paper in another cause pending
between himself and the plaintiff, and, for that reason, took no meas
ures to defend the action, does not constitute "excusable neglect."
White v. Snow, 71-232.
When a party has counsel who knows that his family are sick, so that
he cannot attend at the trial term, yet does not move for a continuance,
but agrees to go into the trial if allowed to read certain letters in evi
dence, which he is permitted to do by plaintiff's counsel, he is not enti
tled to have the judgment set aside on the ground of excusable neglect,
though he might have been had his counsel moved a continuance for
his absence and his motion had been denied. Skinner v. Bryce, 75-287.
Where parties had knowledge of a suit against them, were in town
during the trial term, and did not file any answer nor communicate their
defence to counsel, their neglect is not excusable. Sluder v. Rollins,
76-271.
Where a case was set for trial on a particular day, during a regular
term of the superior court, and a party, after correspondence with his
counsel, failed to leave home in time to reach the court before the time
for trial, his neglect was not excusable, but gross. Bradford v. Coit, 77-72.
Although no one can be made a party except by his consent, or on
proper notice, yet, if, after an order making one a party without notice,
he appear and obtain time to file pleadings, he thereby waives the irregu
larity, and cannot have a judgment set aside by reason of it. Ibid.
Where one wrote to an attorney that he had been sued, but did not
request him to appear for him, he cannot allege his failure to answer as
a case of surprise, mistake or excusable neglect. Hyman v. Capehart,
79-511; Burke v. Stokely, 65-569.
Where a defendant, surety to a guardian bond, upon the suggestion of
his counsel that the recovery against him would be small, admitted the
execution of the bond, this will not entitle him to have the judgment
set aside upon the recovery proving to be a large one. Hodgin v. Mat
thews, S1-2S9.
Where there was an agreement between counsel that no further steps
would be taken in a pending action without notice, and, two years after
the death of defendant's counsel, a judgment was taken, neither the
plaintiff nor his counsel having knowledge or notice of such agreement,
and the defendant having failed to pay any attention to the case, the
defendant's negligence is inexcusable. Kerchner v. Baker, 82-169.
Where a defendant, served with summons, neglects to employ counsel,
and remains away from the place of trial, he cannot have the judgment
set aside because he did not understand the nature of the action. Uni
versity v. Lassiter, 83-38.
An allegation that a party is misled by a verbal agreement between
counsel does not bring the case under this section. Hutchison v. Rumfelt, 83r44l.
Where summons was personally served, but counsel employed by
defendant failed to enter the pleas, and the defendant made no inquiry
about the disposition of the case for nearly five }rears after judgment,
his laches were inexcusable. McLean v. McLe*an, 84-366.
Where the defendant's case was set in the calendar of cases for a day
certain, and copies of the calendar were printed and distributed to his
counsel and others, and also published for two weeks in a newspaper in
the town where the defendant resided and the court was held, the failure
of the defendant to attend at the trial was inexcusable neglect, and he
is not entitled to have the judgment obtained against hiui set aside.
Henry v. Clayton, 85-371.
Where it appears that the defendant was sick and unable to leave
home to attend court when the summons was served upon him, and also
expressed a doubt whether he was the party meant, and the officer
promised that if he found, on inquiry, that he was not the party intended,
he would let him know, the failure of the defendant to have the case
attended to was inexcusable neglect, and he is not entitled to have a
judgment, taken by default against him, struck out. De Priest v. Pat
terson, 85-376.
Where the judgment was rendered by default, six moths after service
of summons, against a defendant who did not employ counsel to attend
to the case, but relied upon the assurances of another to do so, and no defence was made by reason of the attorney mistaking the case, and no
further attention was given to the matter until a year after judgment,
this is inexcusable negligence. Norwood v. King, 86-80.
A defendant who fails to employ counsel or appear, because he sup
posed that he was not required by law to answer the complaint until
served with a copy, is not entitled to relief against a judgment obtained
against him. Churchill v. Insurance Co., 88-205.
The defendant emp'oyed an attorney to appear for him in a case, but
he died about three weeks before the return term of the court ; he had
filled several public offices and his death was announced generally in
the newspapers ; the defendant did not attend at the return term or
employ counsel ; judgment by default was taken, of which he was
informed ; he then proposed a compromise of the claim, but gave the
matter no further attention, and a final judgment was rendered at the
next term of the court : Held, that the defendant cannot have the
judgment set aside for excusable neglect. Kivett v. Wynne, 89-39.
Where the summons, returnable to theensuing September term of the
superior court, was duly served upon the defendant's agent in June, and
at the return term a judgment by default for want of an answer, was
rendered : Held, that neither the letter of the plaintiff 's attorney, writ
ten a few days before the return term, to the president of the defendant
company, requesting a copy of a paper, material "to be used on the
trial in March next, and * * * to insert in my complaint at present,"
nor that the president of the defendant company was a non-resident of
this state, and had little or no knowledge of its judicial procedure or of
the sittings of the terms of its courts, constituted such excusable neg
lect or surprise as would authorze the court to vacate the judgment by
default. Abr.ims v. Insurance Co., 93-60.
The rule that the failure of counsel to file pleadings in apt time will
entitle the client to have relief on the ground of excusable neglect is
not without exceptions ; and the fact that there existed among the mem
bers of the bar an understanding that leave to file pleadings after appear
ance term and during vacation, should extend to the next term, is not
sufficient excusable neglect to authorize the court to vacate the judg
ment and allow defendant to plead, particularly as no application was
made at the trial term to be then allowed to file answer. Brown v.
Hale, 93-188.
Where, pending a reference, the counsel for the parties to the action
became disqualified, but the client, although having notice of the sub
sequent orders, proceedings, etc., in the cause, neglected to retain other
counsel ; this was not such excusable neglect as required the court to
set aside the report and recommit the matter passed upon therein.
Smith v. Smith, 101-461.
Summons was returned at November term, 1883. of the superior court.
Complaint was not filed until near the end of the term of four weeks.
At the fall term, 1884, judgment by default, for want of an answer, was
entered and reference ordered. Defendants and their counsel appeared
before the referee in March, 1887, and from time to time until May,
1887, on which day counsel, who had not previously appeared for them,
moved to dismiss the proceeding on account of iregularity in the man
ner of obtaining judgment. Upon the denial of this motion, one was
made before the court to set aside the judgment upon the additional
ground that it was a surprise : Held, (1) that the court below properly
refused this motion ; (2) defendants did not exercise due diligence in
seeking relief. Roberts v. Allman, 106-391.
Neglect of counsel. —The failure of an attorney to enter an appearance
in a case in which he had been merely written to to appear for the defend
ant, by reason of which a judgment by default was taken against the
defendant, does not make a case for relief within the provisions of this
section. Burke v. Stokely, 65-569 ; Hyman v. Capehart, 79-511.
Judgment should be set aside where the lawyer represented both
parties. Molynenx v. Huey, 81-106 ; Moore v. Gidney, 75-34.
If an attorney appear, and judgment be entered against the client, the
court will not set it aside, though the attorney had no warrant, if he be
solvent and able to respond in damages for his officiousness. University
v. Lassiter, 83-38.
Distinction drawn between the omissions of an attorney and the per
sonal inattention of a suitor in applications for relief under this section.
Ellington v. Wicker, 87-14.
Where the negligence is that of the attorney and not of the party, a
motion to set aside the judgment obtained by defaultshould be granted.
English v. English, 87-497 . Wiley v. Patterson, 94-564.
Neglect on the part of counsel in some cases is not allowed to preju
dice a party ; otherwise when the negligence is that of the party him
self. Boing v. Railroad, 88-62.
The rule that a defendant in an action, who employs an attorney to
appear and defend—but who fails to do so—is entitled to have a judg
ment by default set aside upon the ground of excusable neglect, does
not absolve the client from all attention to the cause. It is still his duty
to furnish the information necessary for the preparation of the answer
and for the trial. Whitson v. Railroad, 95-385.
Where the attorney entered an appearance at the return term, but did
nothing else then, nor at the succeeding term, when judgment by default
was rendered: Held, not to be such excusable neglect as entitled the
defendant to relief. Ibid.
Where the defendant, residing in a county of the state distant from
that in which the action was pending, retained an attorney, who prac
ticed in the courts where the suit was, to represent him, and furnished
him with the facts necessary for his answer, but the attorney failed to
make the proper defences, or notify defendant that his presence was
necessary, by reason of which judgment, for want of answer, was ren
dered, and this was not communicated to defendant for some time after
wards : Held, that the neglect was that of the attorney, and not of the
client, and the latter was entitled to have the judgment set aside. Gwathney v. Savage, 101-103.
Where a defendant employed counsel before the return term, and him
self attended court at that term for four days, and was then told by his
attorney that his case should be attended to, and, relying upon this, he
left, and judgment by default was entered against him, this was excusa
ble neglect. Taylor v. Pope, 106-267.
It is not enough that parties to a suit should engage counsel and leave
it entirely in his charge. They should, in addition to this, give to it
that amount of attention which a man of ordinary prudence usually
gives to his important business. Sluder v. Rollins, 76-271; Roberts v.
Allman, 106-391.
Judgment by consent. —A judgment or order entered by consent of par
ties or their counsel cannot be set aside or modified except upon the
ground of a mistake of both parties, or for fraud, and this by civil action,
not by motion. Stump v. Long, 84-616; Vaughan v. Gooch, 92-524.
A judgment by consent cannot he corrected by the court without the
consent of the parties to it, except as to errors inadvertently made in
entering up the agreement. McEachern v. Kerchner, 90-177.
A judgment by consent cannot be set aside by one of the consenting
parties when an execution issued thereon has been satisfied. Moore v.
Grant
Where a consent judgment was entered which provided that a writ of
possession for certain land was to issue, unless before a specified day
referees appointed in the judgment shall ascertain the amount of pur
chase-money due, and allot to the defendant the land purchased by him,
if the referees fail to act, the remedy is by a motion to modify the judg
ment by extending the time in which they may act, and not by a motion
to set aside the judgment. Moore v. Grant, 92-316.
In order to set aside a consent decree, on the ground that there has
been a mutual mistake in the terms in which it was entered, it must
appear that there was a common intention and understanding which fails
to find expression in the decree. Kerchner v. McEachern, 93-447.
Interlocutory order. — An interlocutory order by consent can only be set
aside by consent or for fraud. Edney v. Edney, S1-1; McEachern v.
Kerchner, 90-177 ; Vaughan v. Gooch, 92-524.
Burden of proof.—In an application to vacate a judgment the burden is
on the applicant to show proper ground for such relief. Sluder v. Rol
lins, 76-271; Kerchner v. Baker, 82-169.
When the parties to a final judgment fail to appeal by their own
default, a rehearing is not a matter of right, but rests in the sound dis
cretion of the court. Before the court will exercise such discretion,
under this section, it must appear, not only that injustice has been done,
but that it was done without laches on the part of the party applying.
Williams v. Williams, 70-665 ; Grant v. Edwards, 8S-246.
A party seeking to vacate a judgment under this section is in default,
and the onus is upon him to show facts which would make the refusal to
vacate an abuse of discretion. Kerchner v. Baker, 82-169.
A motion to strike out an entry of satisfaction of judgment on the
ground of a mistake of fact, must be refused unless the mistake is shown
by a preponderance of proof. Clayton v. Johnson, 82-423.
Where attorneys who represent a defendant, after his death assume to
represent the administrator and consent to his being made a party with
out actual notice, the administrator caunot have the judgment set aside
six years thereafter without alleging a meritorious defence, or misman
agement of counsel, or explaining his long delay. Weaver v. Jones,
S2-440.
A party seeking to have a judgment set aside for excusable neglect,
must set out in his application a prima facie valid defence. The burden
of overcoming the presumption which exists in favor of the validity of
the judgment is upon the applicant who seeks to set it aside. Mauuey
v. Gidney, 88-200.
Grounds for motion. —A superior court can set aside a judgment ren
dered at a former term, for any sufficient cause, which could have been
and was not pleaded in bar of such judgment when rendered. Jarman
v. Saunders, 64-367.
Where a defendant procured an order for a new trial, which was set
aside at the next term, at the instance of the plaintiff, the defendant
had a right to move to set aside the original judgment under this sec
tion, and the judge had the right to grant the motion if, in his discre
tion, the facts justified it. Coffield v. Warren, 72-223.
Section 236 of The Code of Procedure (((412 (4) of this Code), does
not embrace all the grounds on which a new trial may be ordered, but
the grounds there mentioned are only additional to those set out in this
section. Quincy v. Perkins, 76-295.
A defendant who withdraws a counterclaim and submits it to a refer
ence, cannot afterwards have the judgment against him set aside, on the
ground that the defendant is fraudulently obstructing the reference.
Boyden v. Williams, 80-95.

a judgment obtained after the discharge. Paschall v. Bullock, 80-329.
The power of the courts to set aside judgments on the ground of
" surprise, inadvertence, mistake or excusable neglect," is confined to
those cases specifically mentioned in the statute, and does not embrace
such as necessarily follow the verdict, and the vacating of which, with
out disturbing the verdict, would be of no ad-, antage to the party. Beck
v. Bellamy, 93-129 ; Clemmons v. Fields, 99-400.
A judgment regularly entered at one term of the court, cannot be set
aside at a subsequent term, except in cases of surprise, mistake or excusa
ble neglect. State v. Bennett, 93-503.
The fact that the purchase-money was not paid until three months
after sale, and that deed was not made directly to the bidder in accord
ance with the order of sale, but to a third party, who advanced the
money for him, were not such irregularities as the plaintiff (the peti
tioner) could complain of, after the lapse of years, even though it might
have been the duty of the court, if these facts had then appeared, to
have set aside the sale. Coffin v. Cook, 106-376.
This section permitting the court to relieve a party against a judgment
on account of mistake, excusable neglect, etc., refers to mistakes of fact,
not of law. Skinner v. Terry, 107-103.
Mental astonishment, not legal surprise..—Where a defendant, whom the
court had refused to allow to file answer after overruling a frivolous
demurrer, neglected his appeal and allowed judgment to be entered
against him, because he was surprised by the action of the court, and
misunderstood the effect of the judgment ; there was no error in deny
ing his petition to set the judgment aside on that account. Skinner v.
Terry, 107-103.
Notice of motion. —After a judgment, which has been standing for sev
eral terms, has been set aside on motion of defendant, no notice of
motion to reinstate is required. Perry v. Pearce, 68-367.
It is not error to set aside a judgment absolute for an amercement
where it appears that the defendant had no notice of the rule upon him
to show cause. Yeargin v. Wood, S4-326.
Where an application is made to a judge at chambers, or at a term
subsequent to that in which a judgment was rendered, to set it aside on
the ground of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable negligence,
notice must be given to the adverse party, and the judge must find the
facts upon which he bases his ruling, to the end that it may be reviewed
on appeal. Allison v. Whittier, 101-490.
Affidavits not required before hearing. —In hearing motions to set aside
judgments for surprise, etc., there is no rule requiring the affidavits to
be filed before the hearing of the motion is entered on. Jones v. Swepsou, 94-700.
Judgments of former terms. —The judgments authorized to be set aside
for mistake, surprise and excusable neglect, by this section, are judg
ments rendered at former terms, and the section does not refer to what
takes place at the trial term. McCulloch v. Doak, 68-267 ; Beck v. Bel
lamy, 93-129 ; Clemmons v. Field, 99-400.
Set aside in part, or modified. —A judgment may be set aside in whole
or in part, in the discretion of the court. Geer v. Reams, S8-197.

him may be treated as void at any time without any direct proceedings
to vacate it Stallings v. Gully, 48-344 ; Doyle v. Brown, 72-393 ; Condry v. Cheshire, 88-375.
A final judgment by default, entered against a dead man, will be
vacated on motion. Burke v. Stokely, 65-569.
An application to set aside an irregular judgment, does not come
under this section. Such a judgment may be set aside, at any time,
since it does not depend on any surprise or neglect of the defendant,
Cowles v. Hayes, 69-406 ; Mabry v. Erwin, 78-45 ; Monroe v. Whitted,
79-508 ; Vick v. Pope, 81-22.

8-71; Wade v. Odeneal 14-423; Keaton v. Banks, 32-381 ; Bender v.
Askew, 14-149 ; Blue v. Blue, 79-69.
Where the defendant was not served with process, though the appear
ance of counsel for him was entered on the docket, and judgment was
taken by default, of which the complaining defendant had no notice for
sixteen years, such defendant is not estopped from impeaching the
decree for irregularity or other causes in a proper proceeding. Koonce
v. Butler, 84-221.
The remedy against a defective or irregular judgment is by a motion
under this section to set it aside or modify it, and not by an injunction
against issuing execution on it. Parker v. Bledsoe, 87-221.
A judgment taken against infant defendants is irregular, and may be
set aside at any time, when it appears that there was no service of pro
cess upon them and no guardian appointed to protect their rights.
Larkins v. Bullard, 88-35.
A judgment taken against a party after his death is irregular, and
will be set aside in a direct proceeding for that purpose. Lvnn v. Lowe,
88-478.
When an infant appears by attorney an order of removal, like a judg
ment, is not irregular or void. It is erroneous and may be reversed or set
aside by the infant on his arrival of age. Turner v. Douglas, 72-127 ;
Turner v. Holden, 72-137.
The judgment of a court having jurisdiction of the parties and the
subject-matter, though irregular, is valid until reversed, and, if reversed,
a purchaser, in good faith, at a sale made in pursuance of such judg
ment, will be protected. England v. Garner, 90-197.
A judgment against an infant is not absolutely void, but irregular,
and a bona fide purchaser under execution, without notice, will not be
affected. Ibid.
An irregular judgment will not be set aside as of course. The mov
ing party must show that the alleged irregularities affect them adversely
in a material respect, and that they have exercised due diligence in seek
ing relief. Stancill v. Gay, 92-455.
In motions to set aside judgments for irregularity, and other motions
of kindred nature, the rules of evidence are not so strictly adhered to as
in the trial of an issue by a jury. In such cases the court can hear any
evidence which is reasonably calculated to aid it in arriving at a just
conclusion. Ibid,
Where the object is to set aside a judgment for irregularity, although
the action has been determined and a final judgment rendered, a motion
in the cause, and not a new action, is the proper manner of proceeding.
Fowler v. Powe, 93-466.
In passing on the motion to vacate and set aside a judgment as irregu
lar, it is proper for the court to inquire as to the facts and considerations
which led to such judgment. Peoples v. Norwood, 94-167.

sold under an irregular order, either in the capacity of heirs or other
wise, they will be deemed to have acquiesced in the sale, and the courts
will not set it aside. Dawkins v. Dawkins, 104-301.
After the lapse of a long time parties interested will be presumed to
have acquiesced in the order. Ibid.
Courts will not compel a purchaser, at such irregular judicial sale, to
surrender the land until he has been reimbursed the purchase-money
paid by him ; and if he has been in possession for a long time under such
title, he will not be compelled to surrender it upon any terms, unless
the parties show good cause for their delay in asking relief. Ibid.
The proceedings of courts should not be interfered with after long lapse
of time, only for the most weighty reasons. Ibid.
Final judgments may be set aside upon irregularities shown on motion
in the cause made in apt time. McLaurin v. McLaurin, 106-331.
When, on petition to make real estate assets, no service was made
upon the defendants except one, and the infant defendants were not
represented, either by guardian ad litem or otherwise, and the land
brought only one-third of its value, and the sale was without notice to
defendants of its time and place : Held, that these proceedings were in
such utter disregard of the rights of property and the fundamental prin
ciples of law, that they might be pronounced void, on motion in the
cause, made many years after final judgment. Harrison v. Harrison,
106-282.
Judgments, unless when impeached for fraud, will not be set aside for.
mere informalities or omissions which do not defeat the ends of justice,
especially after the lapse of years. White v. Morris, 107-92.
Where it appeared that the infant heirs of the alleged bargainor in an
action to set up a lost deed, were not served with summons, nor was
their guardian ad litem, that they had no general or testamentary guar
dian, that the summons was endorsed served on a day which was shown
to be Sunday, that the date of such endorsement was nearly a month
before it was issued ; and it further appeared that summons was served
upon the grandfather of the infants, with whom they lived, and that
their guardian ad litem entered an appearance in court and filed answer
for them, and that attorneys were employed for them: these facts, taken
together, did not disclose such irregularity as entitled the infants to
have the judgment set aside. Ibid.
Erroneous judgments. —An erroneous judgment cannot be set aside under
this section. Simmons v. Dowd, 77-155.
Rights of third parties. —Where the amendment will make the process
different, in substance, from what it was when issued, the court cannot
allow it if the rights of third parties will be affected. Phillips v. Higdon, 44-380.
Even an irregular judgment cannot be set aside after the rights of an
innocent third party have intervened. Vick v. Pope, 81-22; Winslow v.
Anderson, 20-9.
Findings of fact.—The court cannot review the facts as found by the
court below in an application for relief under this section, but the facts
should be found by the judge, in order that the supreme court mav
review his application of the law to them. Clegg v. The White Soapstone Co., 66-391; Powell v. Weith, 66-423; Jones v. Swepson, 79-510.
What is mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is a ques
tion of law, and if the judge below errs in his ruling in regard thereto,
the supreme court will correct his decision. He is, however, the sole
finder of the facts upon which an application for relief under this section
rests. Powell v. Weith, 68-342.
The finding of the judge upon the facts on which the application is
based is final. Johnson v. Duckworth, 72-244; Branch v. Walker, 92-87;
Taylor v. Pope, 106-267.
In an application to set aside a judgment under this section, the facts
must be found, so that the court may review the ruling of the judge,
whether the judgment was taken by "mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect." Oldham v. Sneed, 80-15; Smith v. Hahn, So- 240;
Bryant v. Fisher, 85-69.
The finding as a fact "that the defendant did not fail to employ coun
sel in consequence of any fraud of plaintiff," is defective, as it consti
tutes a conclusion of law, and not a finding of fact. Smith v. Hahn,
80-240.
Where, in setting aside a judgment for excusable negligence, the judge
does not state the ground on which he founded his order, his action will
be upheld, if, in any aspect of the case, it would be proper. The supreme
court can review on appeal what is mistake, surprise or excusable neg
lect, under \ 274 of The Code, but it canuot review the discretion exer
cised by a judge of the superior court under that section. Foley v.
Blank, 92-476; Albertson v. Terry, 108-75.
Upon an application to set aside a judgment for mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect, the court should specifically find the essen
tial facts. Winborne v. Johnson, 95-46.
Where the court has ascertained the facts and exercised the discretion
conferred by this section, by granting or refusing the relief sought, the
supreme court will not review its action. Ibid.
Upon an application to relieve a party from a judgment, because of
mistake, surprise or excusable neglect, it is the exclusive province of
the judge hearing the matter to find the facts, and his finding is not
reviewable. When a judge grants the relief in tlie exercise of his dis
cretion, that conclusion is also not reviewable; but, whether the facts
found constitute, in law, mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect, may be reviewed, and if it be determined that the court below
erred therein, the judgment will be corrected and the motion remanded,
to the end that the trial judge may exercise the discretion conferred on
him alone by the statute. Weil v. Woodard, 104-94.
Judgments by confession, being final judgments, cannot be attacked
for fraud, by motion; and, no substantial irregularity being shown, the
supreme court will not, in the proceedings had in this action, review
the findings of fact by the court below. Sharp v. Railroad, 106-308.
The court may be requested to find the facts.—A party making a motion to
vacate a judgment because of mistake, surprise or inadvertence has the
right to request the court to specify the ground of its decision, and a
refusal to grant Such request will be error. Albertson v. Terry, 10S-75.
Appeal. —When the appellant has made out his case on appeal and
served it, and the same lias been returned with exceptions, and he had
failed to apply to the judge to give the parties a day to settle the case ;
qucere, whether the facts entitle hitn to any relief under this section.
Kirkham v. Dixon, 66-406.
Pending an appeal to the supreme court no motion can be entertained
in the lower court to set aside the judgment. Isler v. Brown, 69-125 ;
Skinner v. Bland, 87-16S.
Where a judgment is obtained, as is alleged, by the refusal of the
judge to grant a continuance for the absence of the party defendant, he
being represented by counsel and his case submitted to the jury, the
remedy is by appeal. It is not ground to move another judge, under
this section, to set aside the judgment. Twitty v. Logan, 86-712.
What is mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable mistake is a
question of law, and the supreme court will, upon appeal, review an
erroneous judgment thereon. Winborne v. Johnson, 95-46.
Judgment fraudulently suffered. —Where a party fraudulently suffers a
judgment to be entered against him, a motion to reinstate the action and
set aside the judgment will not be allowed. Sherner v. Spear, 92-148,
274.
On motion of a party. —The superior court has no power, under this sec
tion, to set aside a judgment on the motion of a stranger to the original
action, and direct such stranger to be made a party thefeto. Smith v.
Newbern, 73-303.
A judgment can be set aside for irregularity only at the instance of
the party prejudiced. Hinsdale v. Hawley, 89-87; Knott v. Taylor,
99-511No distinction between adults and infants. — In an application under this
section there is no distinction between adult and infant parties, provided
the latter are represented as required by law. Mauney v. Gidney, So200.
Independent actions. —A motion may be made to set aside a judgment
within a year after its rendition, for excusable neglect, and after that
time relief may be had against a judgment obtained by fraud, by an inde
pendent action. Smith v. Hahn, 80-240.
A party to an action is not entitled to relief by an independent action,
if he could have had the judgment set aside under this section, but fails
to make the motion in due time. Walker v. Gurley, 83-429.
A decree which decides the whole merits of a case without any reser
vation for future directions, is final, and can only be set aside or im
peached by a civil action in the nature of a bill of review. Fleming v.
Roberts, 84-532 ; Eure v. Paxton, 80-17; Thaxton v. Williamson, 72125; Covington v. Ingram, 64-123.
A party complaining of a judgment upon the ground of fraud or mis
take, can seek redress oy a new action after final judgment, or by motion
in the cause if it is an interlocutory judgment. McEachern v. Kerchner, 90-177.
Obtaining a judgment by fraud does not make it irregular, and after the
termination of the action the judgment can only be impeached on that
ground by a new action. Before the action is terminated, however, it
maybe set up on a motion in the cause by a petition alleging the fraud.
Williamson v. Hartman, 82-236.
Where an order or judgment is interlocutory, it may be corrected for
fraud or mistake, by a motion in the cause ; but if it be a final judg
ment, it must be done by a civil action. Vaughan v. Gooch, 92-524.
The remedy against a judgment procured by the fraudulent collusion
of opposing counsel, is by an independent action to impeach the judg
ment. Beck v. Bellamy, 93-129.
Where the action or proceeding, in which a judgment has been ren
dered, is ended, the remedy for any fraud therein 13 by an independent
action ; but where it is sought to be avoided for irregularity, the remedy
is by a motion in the cause. Spivey v. Harrell, 101-48.
Any error committed or fraud perpetrated in the conduct of an action
which has regularly terminated, cannot be remedied by a motion in the
cause, but relief must be sought by an action to impeach the former pro
ceeding ; and this action is only open to the parties to the original suit.
Mock v. Coggiu, 101-366.
Where a final judgment or decree has been rendered in a cause, and
it is sought to impeach it for fraud, or for serious irregularity in the pro
ceeding, not apparent in the record, the remedy is by a new and inde
pendent action, and not by a motion in the original cause. Smith v.
Fort, 105-446 ; Bost v. Lassiter, 105-490.
Cannot be attacked collaterally. —The heirs of a decedent, defendants in
a proceeding to make assets, will not be allowed, ordinarily, to collater
ally attack a former proceeding between them and the same administra
tor to sell other lands of the decedent to make assets. Turner v. Shuf
fler, 108-642.
Feme covert. —A judgment obtained against a married woman upon an
official bond, signed by her as surety, without the written assent of her
husband, will be set aside on motion. Harris v. Jenkins, 72-183.
A wife, sued with her husband, who relied on him to employ counsel,
which he fails to do, can have the judgment set aside if motion is made
within one year after notice of the judgment. Nicholson v. Cox, 83-48.
If she fail to do this, an injunction will not lie. Neville v. Pope, 95346.
Non-residents. —The courts being open to non-residents in asserting
their rights will go no further in protecting them than residents from
the consequences of unreasonable delay iu moving to set aside an irregu
lar judgment. England v. Garner, 90-197.
Amendment of the record.-—The court will, in general, permit a record to
be amended, and a judgment to be entered nunc pro tunc, when it has
been delayed by the act of the court or clerk. Bright v. Sugg, 15-492 ;
Long v. Long, 85-415.
Every court can amend its own records, if erroneous, so as to make
them speak the truth ; and this, regardless of the consequences to par
ties, third persons, and of the lapse of time. Walton v. Pearson, 85-34.
This right is inherent in courts without reference to this section. Strick
land v Strickland, 95-471.
Sentble, that an absolute order to amend the record has the legal effect
of an actual amendment. Ibid.
The power of the court to amend its records at a subsequent term is
essential, and such amendment should not be made by simply noting
the order to amend, but by actually correcting the minutes of the former
term. McDowell v. McDowell, 92-227.
The court had the power and did not commit error in ordering the
record of the trial of a criminal action to be amended by inserting the
plea of not guilty after verdict, when all the circumstances connected
with the trial showed that both the State and the defendant had pro
ceeded upon the assumption that the plea had been in fact made, but its
formal entry of record had been inadvertently omitted. State v. Farrar,
104-702.
See I 273, ante, and cases cited.
Res judicata. —Where a motion to set aside a judgment has been
refused, a subsequent motion upon substantially the same grounds will
not be entertained. Mabry v. Henry, 83-298.
Not a contempt. —The application to set aside a judgment under this
section upon insufficient grounds, is not an act of contempt, which will
authorize the court to imprison the applicant until he shall have paid
the debt. Daniel v. Owen, 72-340.
Execution. —The court has no power to amend an execution so as to
divest the title acquired by an innocent purchaser without notice. Wil
liams v. Sharpe, 70-582.
Leave to issue execution. —Where, upon service of a notice of a motiou
for leave to issue execution, the defendant told the sheriff he had a dis
charge in bankruptcy, and asked him to write the plaintiff about it, but
took no further action, he will not be entitled to have leave to issue exe
cution, granted by the clerk, vacated. Hiatt v. Waggoner, 82-173.
Supplementary proceedings. —Where, by an order in supplementary pro
ceedings, a debt due the wife is ordered to be applied to payment of a debt
due by her husband, the wife is entitled to have such order set aside,
she not having been a party when such order was made. Williams v.
Green, 68-183.
Justice's judgment. —A justice's judgment docketed in the superior
court, cannot be impeached, set aside or modified in the superior court,
except upon a recordari first had. Cannon v. Parker, 81-320 ; Ledbetter v. Osborne, 66-379; Birdsey v. Harris, 68-92; Morris v. Rippy, 84-611.
In discretion of judge to allow a new plea, or amendment of plea
below, on appeals from justice. Hinton v. Deans, 75-18.
Clerk no jurisdiction. —Thejudge, and not the clerk of the superior court,
has jurisdiction of an application for relief under this section. Griel v.
Vernon, 65-76.
The clerk of the superior court cannot set aside a judgment in a
special proceeding, for excusable negligence, under the provisions of
\ 274 of The Code, but he can allow an amendment under the provisions
of \ 273. Maxwell v. Blair, 95-317.
In the supreme court. —Although in terms this section applies only to
the superior court, yet the spirit and equity of its provisions extend to
the supreme court, and relief in like cases will be administered in cases
pending in that court. When it appears, therefore, on a petition to
rehear an appeal, which had been dismissed for want of an undertaking
for the costs, that such undertaking was not filed from an excusable
neglect of appellant, the judgment of dismissal will be set aside, and
the case restored to the docket. Wade v. Newbern, 73-318. See, also,
Home v. Home, 75-101.
A report of a referee made to the supreme court, and final judgment
entered thereon, is not open to a motion at a subsequent term to correct
an alleged error in the method of computing interest. The only remedy
to correct an erroneous judgment is by petition to rehear filed in accord
ance with the rule. Garrett v. Love, 90-368.
The spirit and equity of this section apply to the supreme court, and
the same relief will be administered there as in the superior court, in
a proper case. Wiley v. Logan, 94-564.
It manifestly appearing that the supreme court, at a former term, de
termined to reverse a judgment of the court below, but inadvertently an
order of affirmance was made at the foot of the opinion filed by one of the justices, for the court, the court will strike out that order, and enter
one of reversal. Cook v. Moore, 100-294.
Under the constitution of the state, the jurisdiction of the supreme
court to review and revise its final judgments, is confined to the power
to rehear, as regulated by the statute (The Code, #966; Rule 52), and
to relieve a party from a judgment against him by his mistake, excusa
ble neglect, or surprise. The Code, fj 274 ; Farrar v. Staton, 101-78.
Where it appeared, upon a motion made in the supreme court to set
aside a judgment therein rendered, refusing to grant the writ of certio
rari, that the facts upon which the motion was based were known, or
might, with reasonable diligence, have been ascertained, upon the hear
ing of the petition for the certiorari, the motion to vacate was denied.
Williamson v. Boykin, 104-100.
This mode of proceeding favored. —Application to a judge of a superior
court, under this section, is preferable to a certiorari from the supreme
court, when it can be employed for the same purpose. Watson v.
Shields, 67-235.
The law favors the hearing and determination of cases on their merits.
When, therefore, a party moved to set aside a judgment within a year
after its rendition, and afterwards abandoned that for another proceed
ing, having in view the same relief, which was also in turn abandoned,
the whole may be regarded as a continuation of the same proceeding.
Howell v. Harrell, 71-161.
Judgment taken prior to act suspending the C. C. P. —Where, prior to the
act suspending C C P.. judgment was taken before the clerk for want
of an answer, and defendant appealed, the judge had power to strike
out such judgment and allow an answer or demurrer to be filed. Walston v. Bryan, 64-764.
See, also, notes to preceding section.
Sea. 275. When plaintiff ignorant of name of defendant.
C. C. P., s. 134.
When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a
defendant, such defendant may be designated in any plead
ing or proceeding by any name; and when his true name
shall be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be
amended accordingly.
Sec.271*. Errors or defects not substantial to be disregarded.
R. C, c. 3, ss. 5, 0. C. C. P., s. 135.
The court and the judge thereof shall, in every stage of
the action, disregard any error or defect in the pleadings
or proceedings which shall not affect the substantial rights
of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed
or affected by reason of such error or defect.
'
Substantial defects. —Defects in pleadings and proceedings not substan
tial will be disregarded. White v. Morris, 107-92.
Defect in name of party. —A defect in the name of a defendant in the
summons is cured by a judgment by default rendered against him. It
would be also cured by an appeal by defendant without having moved
to dismiss. Clawson v. Wolf, 77-100.
A court, however, has no right to amend process returned at a former
term, without notice to the persons whose rights are to be affected.
Simpson v. Simpson, 64-427.
Where pleadings are reasonably certain. —Where the pleadings, and issues
made by them, are reasonably, certain and understood by the parties,
exceptions thereto will be disregarded. Moore v. Edmiston, 70-510;
Gorman v. Bellamy, 82-496.
Variance between summons and complaint. —It is error to dismiss a com
plaint because the defendants are summoned to answer the complaint
of A and B, and the complaint is in the name of A, B and others. Wil
son v. Moore, 72-558.
Where the summons indicates a different form of relief from that set
out in the prayer of the complaint, the variance should be disregarded.
Ibid.
Variance between allegation and proof. —No variance between the allega
tion in a pleading and the proof shall be deemed material unless it have
actually misled the party. Gibbs v. Fuller, 66-116.
Where a complaint sets out a cause of action, which would have been
in trover under the old practice, while the proof shows a claim in
assumpsit, it is an immaterial variance and should be disregarded. The
distinction between the forms of actions at law having been abolished,
a party cannot be allowed to avail himself of an objection founded on
them. Oates v. Kendall, 67-241.
Although the plaintiff's complaint may set out the facts and ask relief
upon an action on a special contract, yet, upon a ruling of the court that
he cannot recover .upon the special contract, he is entitled to proceed
with his case and recover upon the common counts in general assumpsit,
without any amendment of the pleadings. Jones v. Mial, 82-252.
Better to follow the statute.—In all matters of procedure, it is always best
to strictly follow all statutory requirements. Holly v. Perry, 94-30.
Sir* \\ 269, 270, 271, ante, and the cases and notes under them.
Sec. 277. Supplemental pleadings. C. C. P., s. 136.
The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed,
on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer or
reply, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the
former complaint, answer or reply, or of which the party
was ignorant when his former pleading was made, and
either party may set up, by a supplemental pleading, the
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction,
rendered since the commencement of such action, deter
mining the matter in controversy in said action, or any
part thereof ; and if said judgment be set up by the plain
tiff, the same shall be without prejudice to any provisional
remedy theretofore issued or other proceedings had in said
action on his behalf.
After case has been remanded. —After the case has come back from the
the appellate court, the lower court has power to permit supplemental
pleadings. Holley v. Holley, 96-229.
When necessary.—A supplemental complaint, or answer, is required
from new parties only when the previous record of the cause does not
show how they are connected with the controversy or interested in its
result ; but where the death of the original party and the relationship
of the new parties to him are ascertained, there seems to be no necessity
for supplemental pleadings. Hughes v. Hodges, 94-56.
Canse of action accrued since suit begun. —A cause of action which
occurred after an action was instituted, cannot be interjected in the
pending action by a supplemental complaint, although it relates to the
subject-matter of the pending action. Metcalf v. Guthrie, 94-447.
Sec. 278. Provisions of Code applicable to special proceed
ings.
The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are
applicable to special proceedings, except as otherwise
provided.
What are and what are not special proceedings. —Any proceeding that
under the old mode was commenced by capias ad respondendum, or by
a bill in equity for relief, is a "civil action"; any proceeding that,
under the old mode, might be commenced by petition, or motion upon
notice, is a "special proceeding." Tate v. Powe, 64-644.
A suit to recover possession of land is a civil action, and not a special
proceeding. .Therefore, the summons (by the act of i86.S-'6g, ch. 76,)
is returnable to term time, and not before the clerk. Woodley v. Gil
liam, 64-649.
See cases cited under \ 127, ante.
Summons and complaint required. —A special proceeding by a creditor
against an executor or administrator for an account must be by sum
mons and complaint in the first instance. Where the plaintiff in such
proceedings files a memoranda of evidences of debt but no complaint,
it is irregular. Isler v. Murphy, 76-52.
The clerk has jurisdiction. —The probate court, and not the superior
court at term, has jurisdiction to correct a mistake in partition proceed
ings in which there is no peculiar equitable ingredient. Wahab v. Smith,
S2-229.
A proceeding to sell land for assets is essentially equitable, and the
court has all the powers of a court of equity to accomplish its purpose.
Hudson v. Coble, 97-260.
It seems that in a special proceeding under \ 1448, et seq., of The
Code, the clerk has jurisdiction to render judgment, in favor of a cred
itor, against the personal representative personally, as well as in his
representative capacity, if a devastavit is established. Hester v. Law
rence, T02-319.
In a special proceeding for partition, commenced before the clerk, it
was alleged in the complaint that plaintiff was tenant in common with
the defendant, the facts upon which the tenancy in common was claimed
to exist being set out. The defendant denied the allegation of the
complaint and claimed to be sole owner : Held, that the clerk hadjurisdiction, and the refusal of the judge in term to dismiss the case was
proper, whatever construction is to be placed upon ch. 276, Laws 1887.
Goodman v. Sapp, 102-477.
The clerk has jurisdiction of a proceeding by a ward against his
guardian for an account. McNeill v. Hodges, 105-52.
The charter of a railroad company provided that it might condemn
land by a proceeding commenced before a court of record having com
mon law jurisdiction: Held, that the clerk of a superior court has juris
diction of such proceeding. Railroad v. Railroad, 106-16.
The clerk has not jurisdiction.—The probate court has no jurisdiction
to provide for the payment of the debts of a lunatic contracted prior to
the lunacy. Blake v. Respass, 77-173.
Nor to try the question whether such a debt is owing or not. Smith
v. Pipkin, 76-569.
•
While the jurisdiction in dower is vested in the clerk, if an equitable
element appears the superior court alone can take jurisdiction. Pollard
v. Slaughter, 92-72.
The clerks of the superior courts have no equity jurisdiction in respect
to partition, except that which is specially conferred by statute. The
Code, \\ 1903 and 1904; Bragg v. Lyon, 93-151.
Concurrent jurisdiction.—The probate and superior courts have concur
rent jurisdiction to settle estates. Haywood v. Haywood, 79-42; Britton
v. Davidson, 79-423; Devereux v. Devereux, 81-12.
Also, over lunatics and their estates. Smith v. Pipkin, 79-569.
Also, to compel an administrator to account. Pegram v. Armstrong,
82-326.
Clerk may appoint himself commissioner. —An order made by the clerk
appointing himself a commissioner to sell land, and subsequently to pay
out moneys arising from such sale, is not void. Spencer v. Credle, 102-68.
Case transferred on issue joined. — Where, upon issue joined in a petition
by administrator to sell land to make assets, the proceeding was trans
ferred to the superior court, aud, upon trial, the issues were found in
favor of plaintiff, the judge had no power to order the sale, and the
jurisdiction to direct the application of the proceeds is exclusively in the
clerk. Moore v. Ingram, 91-376.
NOTE. —This is changed by ch. 276, acts 1S87, \ 255, ante. It is now in
the discretion of the judge.
Where issues of fact or of law arise before the clerk acting as a pro
bate court, and the case is transferred or appealed to the superior court,
after action tried there the case must be remanded ; otherwise as to the
action of the clerk, as clerk, which is the action of the court unless
reversed or modified on appeal by the judge, whereupon the clerk pro
ceeds as directed without case being remanded. Brittain v. Mull,
91-498.
NOTE.—Both classes of cases are now retained in the superior court
for all further action unless the judge direct otherwise. Ch. 276, acts
1887, J 255, ante.
When a special proceeding comes before the clerk, it is his duty to
transfer the matter, if issues of fact are joined, to the civil issue docket,
in order that the issues may be tried by a jury. Brittain v. Mull,
94-595Where, in special proceedings, the pleadings are made up before the
clerk, and upon joinder of issues are transferred to the court in term,
the judge has power to allow amendments or he may stay the trial and
remand the papers to the clerk, in order that he may consider a motion
to amend. Loftin v. Rouse, 94-508.
Irregularities. —The statutes enacted to cure irregularities in respect to
the jurisdiction of the courts in special proceedings are valid. Brickhouse v. Sutton, 99-103.
Where, in a proceeding for sale and partition, the answer raised issues
of law and fact, which should have been transferred to the superior
court docket "in term," for trial, but there was no evidence this had
been done, and it did appear that the clerk made an order for sale, that
a sale was made, and the proceeds partitioned, that the parties were all
before the court, and no appeal was taken, nor any proceeding insti
tuted to vacate the action of thp clerk, until several years after the
cause was disposed of, the parties will be presumed to have abandoned
the defences embraced in the issues, and to have acquiesced in the sub
sequent orders, etc. Spencer v. Credle, 102-68.
Feme covert. —A judgment in special proceedings is not conclusive
on a feme covert whose husband is not made a party. Gulley v. Macy,
81-356.
Partition. —Tenants in common of an undivided interest in lands, are
not entitled to have either actual partition, or a sale for partition of such
interest, unless the owners of the remaining interests are made parties
to the proceeding, the statute (The Code, j> 1904) requiring that the whole
tract shall be partitioned or sold, though shares may be allotted to some
of the tenants, while a sale may be decreed as to others. Brooks v.
Austin, 95-474Creditor's bill to settle estate of decedent.—A special proceeding, begun
by way of a creditor's bill, for the settlement of the estate of a decedent and payment of his debts, continues until all the debts are discharged
and there is a final judgment, and is not terminated by being left off the
docket. Warden v. McKinnon, 94-378.
Costs. —Costs are allowed, as in civil actions, etc. Mayo v. Jones,
75-406.
Sec. 279. Summons in special proceedings ; what to contain.
The summons in special proceedings shall command the
officer to summon the defendant to appear at the office of
the clerk of the superior court, on a day named in the sum
mons, to answer the complaint or petition of the plaintiff.
The number of days within which the defendant is sum
moned to appear shall in no case be less than ten, exclusive
of the day of service.
Summons necessary. —The appointment of a trustee, in cases where the
former trustee has died, removed or become incompetent, cannot be
done on an ex parte motion or petition. The application is in the nature
of a civil action, and all persons interested must be made parties and
have full time to set up their rights. Guion v. Melvin, 69-242.
In a special proceeding by a creditor against an executor or adminis
trator, both summons and complaint are necessary. Isler v. Murphy,
76-52.
See \ 284, post.
Amendment of summons. — Process issuing from a court may be amended,
but not where third persons have acquired rights, and the amendment is
in such a matter that their rights may be prejudiced bv it. Phillips v.
Holland, 78-31.
Where the summons in an action or special proceeding, of which the
superior court has jurisdiction, to be exercised by its clerk, is made
returnable to " term time" instead of before the clerk, the judge of the
court may remand it with directions to amend the process so as to make
it properly returnable. Epps v. Flowers, 101-158.
If proper time not allowed.—A summons served on a defendant, com
manding him to answer on a day certain, which day is less than twenty
days from the time of service, is not necessarily on that account void,
and the probate judge is not bound to dismiss it. He should have
allowed the defendant the time allowed by The Code for an appearance.
Guion v. Melvin, 69-242.
If proper time is not allowed, the cause should be retained, not dis
missed. Weiller v. Laurence, 81-65.
Computation of time.—In computing the ten days before the beginning
of a term required for the service of a summons, it is a rule settled by
long practice to include the day of service and exclude the return day,
or e converso. Taylor v. Harris, 82-25.
Note. —This section excludes the day of service, and it also reduces
the time in proceedings before the clerk from twenty days to ten.
Sec. 280. Beturn of summons. C. C. P.,s. 75 •
The officer to whom the summons is addressed shall note
on it the day of its delivery to him ; if required by the
plaintiff, he shall execute the same immediately. When
executed, he shall immediately return the summons, with
the date and manner of its execution, by mail or otherwise,
to the clerk of the court issuing it.
Retainable before the clerk. —The summons in special proceedings is
returnable before the clerk. Tate v. Powe, 64-644.
If served less than ten days. —In special proceedings, if summons is served
less than ten days before return day, the action ought not to be dis
missed, but further time should be allowed defendant to answer. Strayhorn v. Blalock, 92-293.
Sheriff's fees and return.—A sheriff is not compelled to execute a sum
mons until his fees are paid, but he is required to make return of all pro
cess coming into his hands, and is liable for any failure to do so. Jones
v. Gupton, 65-48; Johnson v. Kennedy, 70-435.
Notification to sheriff. —An officer, notified of the necessity of prompt
measures for the execution of process placed in his hands, should take
care to execute it without delay. Wasson v. Linster, 83-575.
Sec. 281. Complaint in case of special proceedings ; when
filed. C. C. r., s. Hi. 1870-'7, c. 241, s. 4.
It shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to file his complaint
or petition with the clerk of the court to which the sum
mons is returnable, at the time of issuing the summons, or
within ten days thereafter.
Petition for partition. —In a petition for partition, an allegation that the
defendant has an estate in a certain number of acres of said land, is insuf
ficient, as it would indicate that the defendant has a several estate in
that number of acres. Baum v. Shooting Club, 96-310.
The petition is defective unless it sets forth that the petitioners are
tenants in common, and in, possession, and a description of the land.
Alsbrook v. Reid, 89-151.
A petition asking for partition of several tracts not held by same ten
ants in common, and for an adjudication upon the disputed title of one
of them, is multifarious. Simpson v. Wallace, 83-477.
The petition must show an estate in possession. Wood v. Sugg, 91-93 ;
• Osborne v. Mull, 91-203.
A petition for a sale for partition need only allege that the petition
ers and defendants are tenants in common, and in possession of the land,
and the necessity of a sale for partition. The court will treat allegations
in regard to the relationship of the parties intended to show from and
through whom title to the land was derived, etc., as useless and unnec
essary. McGill v. Buie, 106-242.
Misjoinder of parties. —The same principle which forbids the improper
joinder of causes in civil actions applies to special proceedings. Garri
son v. Cox, 99-478. See \ 239 (5), ante.
Sec. 282. Plaintiff failing to file nomplaint or petition
within the time for defendant's appearance, may be non
suited. C. C. P., s. 78.
If the plaintiff shall fail to file his complaint or petition
within the time limited by the summons for the appear
ance and answer of the defendant, the defendant shall be
entitled to demand judgnient of nonsuit against the plaintiff.
When plaintiff can take a nonsuit. —This provision does not prevent the
plaintiff from taking a nonsuit at his own election wherever only a judg
ment for costs can be rendered against him. When the answer would
justify an affirmative relief to the defendant, he cannot. McKesson v.
Mendenhall, 64-502.
Where no counterclaim is pleaded, a plaintiff has the right to take a
nonsuit at any time before verdict or final judgment. An interlocutory
judgment does not deprive a plaintiff of the right to take a nonsuit.
Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
On trial of an issue devisavit vel non. —Anyone may withdraw, if he sees
proper, but none have a right to take or suffer a judgment of nonsuit,
or dismiss the proceeding. Hutson v. Sawyer, 104-1
If moved for at close of plaintiff's evidence. —When a nonsuit is asked at
the end of plaintiff's evidence, it is the better practice for the judge
to reserve the point until after verdict. Davis v. Ely, 100-283.
Cannot be entered after judgment. —A nonsuit cannot be entered after
judgment. Mauney v. Long, 91-170.
When plaintiff cannot take a nonsuit. —If the defendant set up a counter
claim the plaintiff cannot take a nonsuit. Purnell v. Vaughan, 80-46.
A plaintiff who has gotten possession under claim and delivery
cannot take a nonsuit and cut off defendant's pleas. Manix v. Howard,
82-125.
A motion to nonsuit not a substitute for a demurrer.—A motion to nonsuit
cannot be made a substitute for demurrer. If a complaint does not
show a cause of action the defendant should demur. He has a right to
move for nonsuit only under the provisions of this section. Andrews v.
Pritchett, 66-387.
Nonsuit is not retraxit. —Entry of " nonsuit, judgment against plaintiff
for costs," is not a relraxit. Wharton v. Currituck, 82-11.
Judgment as of nonsuit, new action. —An action dismissed for a cause not
involving merits, like a nonsuit, does not deprive the plaintiff of the
right to bring a new suit for the same cause of action. Halcombe v.
Commissioners, 89-346.
See 1 1 66, ante.
Note.—Most of these are in civil actions, not in special proceedings,
but the same principle applies. See j! 238, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 283. Time of filing pleading* may be enlarged. C. C.
P., s. 79.
The time for riling the complaint, petition, or of any
pleading whatever, may be enlarged by the court for good
cause shown by affidavit, but it shall not be enlarged by
more than ten additional days nor more than once, unless
the default shall have been occasioned by accident over
which the party applying had no control, or by the fraud of
the opposing party.
Sight inherent in a, court. —The superior courts possess an inherent
right, independent of the C. C. P., to allow pleadings to be filed at any
time, unless prohibited by the statute, or unless vested rights have inter
vened. Gilchrist v. Kitchen, 86-20.
Clerk may allow answer to be filed. —Where an application was filed to
remove an administrator and no answer having been filed, the clerk
refused the motion, and on appeal the judge reversed the order and
remanded the case, the clerk has power to allow an answer to be filed.
Patterson v. Wadsworth, 94-538.
Sec. 284. When all parties ask 8<i me relief. C.'C. P., s. 418.
1868-'9, c. 93, s. 1.
If all the parties in interest join in the proceeding and
ask the same relief, the commencement of the proceeding
shall be by petition, setting forth the facts entitling the
petitioners to relief, and the nature of the relief demanded.
Partition. —A petition for partition must give a description of the land
and set forth that the parties are tenants in common and in possession,
in order to give the court jurisdiction. Alsbrook v. Reid, 89-151. See
other cases cited, \ 281, ante.
Where a testator devised certain real estate to his wife for lrfe or
widowhood, and, after her death, to his three daughters, naming them,
"as long as they wish to keep house together, " providing for sale and
division among " his children and their heirs," if they (his daughters)
" should marry or wish to quit keeping house," and one of the daughters,
the others being dead, is still keeping house on the land, the land is not
subject, during her life to partition among the heirs. Hays v. Davis,
105-482.
Where a petition for partition of laud alleged that the petitioners and
the defendant are tenants in common, and that the defendant is in pos
session, claiming title to one share, a demurrer upon the ground that
the petition "does not allege that the petitioners are in possession of
the land, and only alleges that they are entitled to have possession,"
will be overruled. McGill v. Buie, 106-242.
Sale of land for assets. —A claim for contribution cannot be set up by
one defendant against another in a proceeding to sell land for assets.
When the amount exceeds two hundred dollars, the court in term alone
has jurisdiction of such cause of action, except in cases of contribution
between persons claiming as devisees under a will, or as heirs at law of
a testator to whom undevised land has descended, which exception is
caused by 1 1534 of The Code. Wharton v. Wilkerson, 92-407.
Where a special proceeding was brought to sell land for assets, in pur
suance of orders in which the land was sold, but, on account of grave
irregularities in this proceeding, another was brought, with the consent
of the administrator and purchaser, to which the heirs were parties, such
second proceeding was sufficient to cure the irregularities in the first,
and none of the parties thereto could be heard to complain of it. Ward
v. Lowndes, 96-367.
Actios against administrator. —Every action brought in the probate
court to recover a debt of an administrator is necessarily a creditor's
bill. Ballard v. Kilpatrick, 71-281.
Sec. 285. In what cases clerk may hear summarily. C. C.
F., s. 410. 1868-'0, c. OS, s. 2.
In such cases, if all persons to be affected by the decree,
or their attorney, shall have signed the petition, and they
be of full age, the clerk of the superior court shall have
power to hear the petition summarily, and to decide the
same. If either or any of the petitioners shall be residing
out of the state, an authority from him or them to the
attorney, in writing, must be filed with the clerk before he
shall make any order or decree to prejudice their rights.
Issue of fact. —In special proceedings before the clerk, when issues of
fact are joined, they must be certified to the court in term for trial. As
soon as such issues are tried, it is the province of the clerk, and not of
the judge, to make orders in the cause. Wharton v. Wilkerson, 92-407;
Harper v. Harper, 92-300.
When an issue of fact is joined in such proceeding, or issues of both
fact and law, it is the duty of the clerk to place the proceeding on the
docket of the trial term for trial. Jones v. Desem, 94-32.
Issue of law.—Where an issue of law is joined in a special proceeding,
it is the dutv of the clerk to transmit it to the judge for his decision.

review order. C.C.P.,s.4iO. I8ti8-'U, c.O:i, s.3. 1887,
c. 01, s. 1,
If any of the petitioners be an infant, or the guardian
of an infant, acting for him, no final order or judgment
of the clerk affecting the merits of the case and capable
of being prejudicial to the infant shall be valid unless sub
mitted to and approved by the judge [resident in the disl
trict or the judge holding court therein. Any approval
heretofore made of any sale of the land of any infant in
any ex parte proceeding, wherein such infant has appeared
by his or her guardian, by a judge of the district or a judge
holding court therein, is hereby in all things conf1rmed, as
far as regards the jurisdiction of the judge approving such
proceedings].
Note—The words of this section in brackets, were added by ch. 61,
acts 1887.
Approval by judge; when required.—Proceedings reqmre approval of
judge only where petitioners are infants and proceedings are ex parte.

s. 421. 1808-'if, c. 93, s. 4.
When special proceedings are had against adverse parties,
they shall be commenced as is prescribed for civil actions.
Summons required. —The appointment of a trustee by a judge of probate,
in cases where the former trustee has died, removed from the county, or
become incompetent, cannot be done on an ex parte motion or petition.
The application for such appointment is in the nature of a civil action,
and all persons interested must be made parties, and have full time and
opportunity to set up their respective claims. Guion v. Melvin, 69-242.
Motion to enter satisfaction of a judgment. —A proceeding by a motion,
supported by affidavits after a notice to the opposite party, to have sat
isfaction of a judgment entered of record upon the ground that it has
been paid since its rendition, is the appropriate remedy in such a case,
but is neither a special proceeding nor a civil action. It is only a motion
in a cause still pending. Foreman v. Bibb, 65-128.
See \ \ 279 and 284, ante, and cases there cited.
Jurisdiction. —Where proceedings were brought before the probate*judge
which should have been brought before the clerk, and vice versa, the
irregularity is cured by the statute (Bat. Rev., ch. 17, ^425, 426), Ward
v. Lowndes, 96-367.
When, without amendment, matters are investigated before the clerk
without objection, of which the superior court alone had jurisdiction, and
judgment is rendered thereon, the implied consent does not confer juris
diction, and advantage can be taken in the supreme court of the defect
on appeal. Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
Misjoinder. —It is improper to join a motion to remove an administra
tor with a motion to set aside a judgment. The clerk, on questions of
removal, exercises a jurisdictional function as clerk, while the other is
a special authority conferred upon him by statute, as to judgments ren
dered by him. McLaurin v. McLaurin, 106-331.
Right to trial by jury. —If the landowner can even demand that an
issue be found upou the question of damages in condemnation proceed
ings, previous to the appointment of commissioners, he cannot do so
after the report of the commissioners and exceptions to it are filed. The
judge then has the power to order a new appraisement, to modify or
confirm the report, but not to allow, on motion of one of the parties, in
spite of the objection of the other, a trial of the issues by jury. Rail
road v. Parker, 105-246.
The issue in proceedings to assess damages for right-of-way condemned
for a railroad, is not an issue which either party has a constitutional
right to have submitted to a jury. Railroad v. Davis, 19-451.

422. 1868-'9, c. 93, s. 5. 1872-'3, c. 100.
Every order or judgment in a special proceeding, which
is required to be made by -a judge of the superior court,
either in or out of term, shall be authenticated by his sig
nature.
Directory only. —The act requiring the signature of a judge to authen
ticate his judgments and decrees, is directory only, and such signature
is not essential to their validity. Matthews v. Joyce, 85-25S ; Rollins v.
Henry, 78-342.
Except on issues of fact, not required. —Where, in such proceedings, the
record does not disclose that issues of fact have been transferred to the
court in term, any orders made by the judge are extra-judicial. Whar
ton v. Wilkersou, 92-407.
Final decree. — Where, in special proceedings upon petition to sell lands
for assets, there had been an order of sale, sale had been made, duly
reported and confirmed, and the commissioner authorized to make title
to the purchaser, this was a final decree. McLaurin v. McLauriu,
106-331.
Before judge only by appeal. —In order for a special proceeding to get
before the judge of a superior court on a question of law, there must be
an appeal from some judgment of the clerk. Taylor v. Bostic, 93-415.
Clerk signs orders. —When the issues of both fact and law are decided,
the clerk proceeds to give all other orders and judgments as and for
the court, these orders and judgments being regarded as made by the
court through its proper officer. Jones v. Desern, 94-32.
Judge may retain the cause. —Where issues are made before the clerk in
a special proceeding and transferred to the civil issue docket, the judge
may now, under ch. 276, Laws 1887 (? 255, ante), hear and determine all
matters in controversy and make a final decree. Foreman v. Hough,
98-386.
Court may stay proceedings in partition. —Where it appears to the court
in a proceediug for partition, that it may become necessary to sell the
lands for assets, it should stay the partition until the personal represen
tative can have reasonable opportunity to apply for a license. Garrison
v. Cox, 99-478.
Sec. 280. Xo report set aside for trivial defect. C, C. P., s.
424. 18GS-'0, c. 93, s. 7.
No report or return made by any commissioners shall be
set aside and sent back to them, or others for a new report,
by reason of any defect or omission not affecting the sub
stantial rights of the parties, but such defect or omission
may be amended by the court, or by the commissioners, by
permission of the court.
Report conclusive, unless set aside.—The report of commissioners ap
pointed to condemn lands and assess damages for the purpose of drain
age is, like the verdict of a jury, conclusive of the facts therein ascer
tained, until set aside. Railroad v. Ely, 101-8.
Substantial defect. —The omission in a report of commissioners to make
partition of lands to state affirmatively that the allotments, in their
opinion, were equal in value, affects the substantial rights of the parties,
and the clerk or judge may set it aside with directions, either that the
commissioners shall make a re-allotment, or that others shall be appointed
to do so. Skinner v. Carter, 108-106.
Sec. 290. No person to be arrested except as prescribed. C.
C. P., s. 148.
No person shall be arrested in a civil action, except as
prescribed by this chapter ; but this provision shall not
apply to proceedings for contempt.
Ancillary remedy .—Arrest and"bail is an ancillary or provisional remedy,
and presupposes an original action, in which the provisional remedy
may or may not be applied for. Jarinan v. Ward, 67-32.
Where there is no order of arrest before judgment. —Where there is no
order of arrest before judgment, nor any complaint averring such facts
as would have justified such order, a defendant cannot be arrested after
judgment under an execution against the person under the C C P.,
g 258, (Code, §442, post.) Houston v. Walsh, 79-35.
Sec. 291. In what cases. C. L\ P., s. 149. R.C.,c.31,s.
54. 1777, c. 11S, s. 0. 1809-'70, c. 79, s. 1. 1891, c. 541,
s. 1.
The defendant may be arrested, as hereinafter prescribed,
in the following cases :
(1) In an action for the recovery of damages, on a cause
of action not arising out of contract, where the defendant
is not a resident of the state, or is about to remove there
from, or where the action is for an injury to person or
character, or for injuring, or for wrongfully taking, detain
ing or converting property real or personal;
NOTE. —The words " real or personal " at the end of this subsection
were added by ch. 541, acts 1891.
Insufficient affidavits.^—An affidavit that the defendant is "about to
leave the state " is in sufficient to obtain an order of arrest, because—
1. It does not set forth that it is with the intent to defraud his cred
itors ; and
2. It does not state the ground of affiant's belief that the defendant
is about to commit the act apprehended ; which is necessary to be done
in order that the court may perceive that he has reasonable cause for
such apprehension. Wilson v. Barnhill, 64-121.
An affidavit alleging that the defendant "is about to remove from the
state of North Carolina, to become a resident of the state of Virginia,"
is insufficient' if it does not state the reasons of the belief in regard to
what is about to occur, in order that the court may judge whether his
apprehensions be reasonable or not. Wood v. Harrell, 74-338.
Applied to personal property only.—The provision in this section, for the
arrest of a defendant, " for injuring or for wrongfully taking, detaining
or converting property," has reference to personal and not real properly,
notwithstanding the definition of the word property in \ 3765 (6). Bridgers v. Taylor, 102-86.
Notk. —This decision was prior to the amendment of 1891 above stated.
When grounds of belief must be stated. —When the plaintiff, in his affi
davit to obtain an order of arrest, relies upon his apprehension of what
the defendant is aboul to do, as "remove from the state," "secrete his
property," etc., he must state the grounds on which he bases such
apprehensive belief, in his affidavit ; but when he relies on a fact already
accomplished, it is sufficient, if such facts be stated in the words of
The Code authorizing the arrest, as that the defendant "has secreted
his property with intent to defraud his creditors," etc. Hughes v. Per
son, 63-548.
In an application for an order of arrest, the applicant is recjuired to
set forth fully and with legal precision the facts which constitute his
alleged cause of action. If they are of his own knowledge, they should
be positively stated, and if they are upon belief, he should state the
sources of his information, so that the court can determine if a proper
cause of action exists. Harris v. Sueeden, 101-273.
Rumor. —Mere general rumor that a person indebted has removed to
another state is not sufficient to justify his creditor in suing out a war
rant for his arrest. There should be such evidence as would induce a
reasonable man to believe that the facts existed upon which he based
his application. Tucker v. Wilkins, 105-272.
Construction of statute. —Where the terms of a statutewhich has received
judicial construction are used in a later statute, that construction is to be
given to those terms in the later statute. Bridgers v. Taylor, 102-86.
When cause of arrest is stated in the complaint.—The cause for arrest,
when set forth in the complaint, must be stated with as much explicitness as when set forth in an affidavit. Peebles v. Foote, 83-102.
Constitutional prohibition of imprisonment for debt.—The constitutional
prohibition of imprisonment for debt does not protect from an arrest
under this section in actions for tort. Moore v. Green, 73-394; Long v.
McLean, 88-3.
Slander of title.— It is questionable if an order of arrest may be properly
granted in an action for slander of title. Harris v. Sneeden, 101-273.
Seduction of a daughter.—The seduction of a daughter is an injury to
the person of the father, within the meaning of this section, and a suf
ficient ground for arrest. Hoover v. Palmer, 80-313. See now express
words of subsection 2.
See \ 447, post, and cases there cited.
(2) Iil an action for a fine or penalty, or for seduction, or
for money received, or for property embezzled or fraudu
lently misapplied by a public officer, or by an attorney,
solicitor or counsellor, or by an officer or agent of a corpo
ration or banking association, in the course of bis employ
ment as such, or by any factor, agent, broker or other per
son in a fiduciary capacity, or for any misconduct or neglect
in office, or in a professional employment;
Administrator. —An administrator who has been fixed with assets which
are not forthcoming is not thereby necessarily found guilty of fraud, so
as to subject him to arrest under this section. Melvin v. Melvin, 72-384.
Promise to marry. —The provision of this section, authorizing the arrest
of the defendant "in an action on a promise to marry," is in violation
of Art. 1, 16 of the Constitution, which provides that "There shall be
no imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud." "A breach of
promise to marry," says Pearson, C J., "is no more a 'case of fraud'
than a breach of any other promise. The purpose in McNeely v. Haynes,
76- 122, was to restrain that decision to the case in hand, as we do this,
so as to let the other subsections stand on their own construction, except
so far as these two cases may furnish analogies." Moore v. Mullen,
77-327Qucere, whether, in a case of breach of promise of marriage, accom
panied with seduction and an attempt to flee the state, the element of
fraud would justify the defendant's arrest. Ibid.
Note.—The words " on a promise to marry " (on which Moore v. Mul
len, ante, was decided) have since been stricken out of this subsection.
Seduction. —This subsection, authorizing the arrest of a person in an
action for seduction, is not in conflict with the provision of the Consti
tution prohibiting imprisonment for debt. Kinney v. Laughenour,
97-325Applies to all fiduciary relations.—This subsection is intended to embrace
all cases where the relation of trust and confidence in respect to money
received or personal property in possession by one party for the benefit
of another is raised by contract. Travers v. Deaton, 107-500.
Where the defendant agreed to receive and sell for plaintiff, for cash
and on time, certain guano described, himself becoming liable and
indebted for its value at an agreed price, accounting and turning over
to plaintiff the guano unsold and the proceeds of all sales, this consti
tuted a fiduciary relationship embraced by this subsection, and if the
defendant convert such funds to his own use, he is liable to arrest.
Travers v. Deaton, 107-500.
Agent. —A debtor endorsed to his creditor certain notes as collateral
security, but retained possession of them under an agreement that lie
was to collect when due, and pay the proceeds to the creditor : Held,
that this made him the agent of the creditor, and subjected him to arrest
in a civil action for fraudulently failing to account for the sums he col
lected under the agreement. Powers v. Davenport, 101-286.
(3) In an action to recover the possession of personal
property, unjustly detained, where the property or any part
thereof has been concealed, removed or disposed of, so that
it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff, and with the
intent that it should not be so found or taken, or with the
intent to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof;
Fraud after contracting debt. —A person may be arrested and held to bail
for a fraud committed after the contracting of the debt, e. g., by con
cealing property, or other devices for defeating the creditor. Powers
v. Davenport, 101-286.
(4) When the defendant has been guilty of a fraud in
contracting the debt, or incurring the obligation for which
the action is brought', or in concealing or disposing of the
property for the taking, detention or conversion of which
the action is brought, or when the action is brought to
recover damages for fraud or deceit;
Affidavit sufficient. —Where the plaintiff alleged in his affidavit that the
defendant had sold him a patent right, representing it to be genuine and
no infringement on any other patent, which was false, and that the
defendant was a non-resident, the order was properly issued. Bahnson v.
Cheseboro, 77-325.
Fraud of one partner. —The fact that one partner has obtained goods for
the firm by false representations does not make the other partner liable
to arrest therefor, unless he is shown to be guilty of the fraud, and an
affidavit charging one partner with such fraud will not justify the arrest
of the other. McNeely v. Haynes, 76-122.
Non-resident. —A non-resident of this state may be arrested and held to
bail for fraud under this subsection. Powers v. Davenport, 101-286.
(5) When the defendant has removed or disposed of his
property, or is about to do so, with intent to defraud his
creditors;
Information and belief. —An affidavit, alleging the debt and fraud in con
tracting, and "upon information and belief," a concealment of property
by the defendant, is good. Paige v. Price, 78-10; Peebles v. Foote, 83102.
See Cowles v. Hardin, 79-517.
Statement of reasons for belief. —An affidavit, stating that " the defend
ant has disposed of his property with intent to defraud his creditors," is
good, if it stops there. When, however, it proceeds to give a reason for
that belief, the reason must be sufficient or the affidavit will not suffice.
So when it adds, " In this, that although he has received from the plain
tiffs alone over $7,000 in specie and $7,600 in currency, and owes upward
of $3,000, he has not paid any of his debts," is insufficient to justify the
arrest of the defendant. Smith v. Gibson, 74-684.
(6) But no woman shall be arrested in any action, except
for a willful injury to person, character or property ; and no
person shall be arrested on Sunday.
Arrest on Sunday.—The arrest of the defendant is illegal if made on Sun
day. Devries v. Summit, 86-126 ; White v. Morris, 107-92.
Sec. 292. Order of arrest; from whom obtained. C. C. P.,
s. 1X0.
An order for the arrest of the defendant must be obtained
from the court in which the action is brought, or from a
judge thereof.
By whom order granted. —The order of arrest must proceed from the
court in which the action is brought, or from a judge thereof. Houston
v. Walsh, 79-35.
If affidavit insufficient, order not void.—An order of arrest granted by a
court having jurisdiction is not void, though it may be erroneous, if
issued on an insufficient affidavit. Tucker v. Davis, 77-330.
Regular and irregular process. —Regular process is a justification of a
taking made under it, when it issues from a court of competent juris
diction, but not for any conversion of the property. Woody v. Jordan,
69-189.
Irregular process, after it has been set aside, is no justification to the
plaintiff, his agents or attorneys. Ibid.
Sec. 293. Order obtained on affidavit, and to what actions
applicable. C. C. P., .•». IM. 18G9-'70, c. 79, 8. 1.
The order may be made where it shall appear to the
court or judge thereof, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or of
any other person, that a sufficient cause of action exists,
and that the case is one of those provided for in this sub
chapter.
Sufficient affidavit. —Where the plaintiff's affidavit alleges the existence
of a cause of action and the fraud committed by defendant in contracting
the debt, and that upon information and belief the defendaut has fraud
ulently removed and disposed of his property, it justifies issuing an order
of arrest. Paige v. Price, 78-10 ; Peebles v. Foote, 83-102.
An affidavit, by the plaintiff, alleging that the defendant had sold him
a certain patent right, representing the same to be genuine and no
infringement upon any prior patent, which representations were false
and intended to deceive the plaintiff, who had been damaged the amount
of the purchase-money paid the defendant, and the defendant is a non
resident, justifies issuing a warrant of arrest. Bahnson v. Cheseboro,
77-325Insufficient cause. —Breach of a promise to marry is not a "case of fraud,"
and does not justify an order of arrest. Moore v. Mullen, 77-327.
Where one partner in a firm obtains credit by false representations,
the other partner is not liable to arrest. McNeely v Haynes, 76-122.
Insufficient affidavit. —An affidavit that does not set forth how the funds
in the hands of an administrator have been misapplied is not sufficient
to justify holding him to bail. Melvin v. Melvin, 72-384.
Additional affidavit. —Leave to amend an affidavit by filing an additional
one is a matter of discretion, but after the defendant has been discharged
for defect in the affidavit, the plaintiff may at once apply for another
order upon a new affidavit. Wilson v. Barnhill, 64-121.
Where the affidavit 011 which the order (of attachment) issued is defec
tive, and the defendant moves to dismiss on counter-affidavits, to which
the plaintiff replies with one which is sufficient, the seebnd affidavit
cures the defects of the first. Clark v. Clark, 64-150.
Validity of order of arrest, how determined. —The validity of an order of
arrest, and warrant of attachment is determined upon facts alleged in
the original affidavit and existing when the proceeding is instituted, not
upon new matter which may have afterwards transpired. Devries v.
Summit, 86-126.
Kes judicata. —A motion to discharge the defendant from custody, is
equivalent to a motion to vacate the order of arrest, and can only be
made before judgment. If such a motion is made and refused, it cannot

by a court having jurisdiction is not void. It may be erroneous if issued
upon an insufficient affidavit. Tucker v. Davis, 77-330.
Findings of fact. —The findings of fact by the judge, in an action at
law, upon which an order of arrest is made or vacated, are conclusive.
Harris v. Sneedeu, 101-273. '
Constitutional prohibition of imprisonment for debt. —The constitutional
prohibition against imprisonment for debt does not protect from arrest
in actions for tort. Moore v. preen, 73-394 ; Long v. McLean, 88-3
Affidavit before non-resident notary. —A non-resident notary public has
no authority to take an affidavit to be used in the courts of this state to
obtain an order of arrest. Benedict v. Hall, 76-113.
See \ 258, as amended, and cases cited under \ 291, ante.

C. C. P., s. 152. 1808-'9. c. 277, s. 7.
Before making the order, the court or judge shall require
a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with suf

all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest,
not exceding the sum specified in the undertaking, which
shall be at least one hundred dollars.
Action in forma pauperis. —Oue suing as a pauper cannot have an order
of arrest without giving this undertaking. Rowark v. Homesley, 68-91.
Sec. 295. Time when order may issue, its form ; time to
answer or move to vacate. V. C. P., s. 153.
The order may be made to accompany the summons, or

specific sum, and to return the order, at a place and time
therein mentioned, to the clerk of the court in which the
action is brought, and notice of such return shall be served
on the plaintiff or his attorney as prescribed in chapter ten
for the service of other notice.
But said order of arrest shall be of no avail, and shall be
vacated or set aside on motion, unless the same is served
upon the defendant, as provided by law, before the docket
ing of any judgment in the action ; and the defendant shall
have twenty days after the service of the order of arrest, in
which to move to vacate the order of arrest, or to produce
the amount of bail.
Order must issue before judgment.—The order cannot issue after final
judgment rendered. Houston v. Walsh, 79-38.
Unless issued twenty days before judgment docketed, it will, on
motion, be vacated. Ibid.
Returnable before clerk. —An order returnable before the clerk is legal.

to be delivered to defendant by sheriff on his arrest. C. C.
P., s. 184,

Non-residents. —The plaintiff obtained an order for the arrest of the
defendants, who were non-residents. They being unable to give bail,
filed their petition to be allowed the benefits of the statute relating to
insolvent debtors : Held, they were entitled to the benefits of such
statute. Burgwyn v. Hall, 108-489.
Applies to tortB as well as debts,—The benefits of the statute extend as
well to those arrested for torts as for debt, and the debt growing out of
one is no more a debt and no more entitled to extraordinary process for
its collection than the other. Burgwyn v. Hall, 108-489.
After discharge, action lies for false arrest. —The pendency of an appeal
from a judgment of the justice of the peace upon the cause of action—
the order of arrest having been discharged as void—is no bar to the
maintenance of an action for unlawfully causing the arrest of an alleged
debtor upon the void order of arrest. Tucker v. Wilkins, 105-272.
Sec. 299. Undertaking of defendant ; form of. C. C. P.,
s. 157.

and sheriff's certificate, the court, or a judge thereof, may,
upon a notice to the plaintiff of ten days, with a copy of
the certificate, order that the bail be exonerated, and on
filing the order and papers used on said application, they
shall be exonerated accordingly. But this section shall
not apply to an arrest for cause mentioned in subdivision
three of section two hundred and ninety-one, so as to dis
charge the bail from an undertaking given to the effect
provided by section three hundred and twenty-six.
Insolvent debtor law. —Every person taken or charged on an order of
arrest for default of bail, or on surrender of bail in any action, and
every person taken or charged in execution or arrest for any debt or
damage rendered in any action whatsoever, is entitled to the benefits of
the chapter entitled "Insolvent Debtors." Burgwyn v. Hall, 108-489.
See. 301. Bail may arrest defendant. C. C. P , .*. 159.
For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail,
at any time or place, before they are finally charged, may
themselves arrest him, or by a written authority, endorsed
on a certified copy of the undertaking, may empower any
person over twenty-one years of age to do so.
Bail may arrest. —The bail, for the purpose of surrendering the defend
ant, is empowered at any time before he is finally charged, to arrest him,

s. 1SO.
In case of failure to comply with the undertaking, the
bail may be proceeded against by motion in the cause on
ten days' notice to such bail.
Bail, how proceeded against. —Previous to the enactment of The Code,
the plaintiff in a suit had no remedy on a bail bond except a scirefacias
in the original cause. Carleton v. Sloan, 64-702.
A writ of scirefacias to subject bail was an original proceeding, under
the former practice, for which The Code substitutes the civil action.
McDowell v. Asbury, 66-444.
The bail may be proceeded against by motion. Insurance Co. v.
Davis, 74-78.
Note.—This section at that time provided that the bail could be pro
ceeded against " by action only." It has been amended since to con
form to the decision, and the remedy is by motion.
By motion.—The remedy now is by a summary motion in the cause.
Patton v. Gash, 99-280.
Sec. .303. Bail, how exonerated. C. C. P., s. 101.
The bail may be exonerated, either by the death of the
defendant, or his imprisonment in a state prison, or by his
legal discharge from the obligation to render himself amen
able to the process, or by his surrender to the sheriff of
the county where he was arrested, in execution thereof, at
any time before final judgment against the bail.
State prison. —The term " state prison," a« used in this section, applies
either to the penitentiary or the county jail. Sedberry v. Carver,
77-3>9.
Imprisonment before judgment.—The bail is not exonerated by the fact
that the principal is imprisoned for a crime, when the term of impris
onment has expired before the judgment against the bail. The statute
does not mean that the bail shall be exonerated because the principal
shall have been put in prison, but if he shall be in prison when the bail
may be called upon to surrender him. Adrian v. Scanlin, 77-317.
Where the imprisonment of the defendant, in another proceeding,
expires before judgment is obtained, either against the principal in the original action or against the bail upon his undertaking, the bail is not
exonerated by such imprisonment. Sedberry v. Carver, 77-319.

not ice thereof to plaintiff, and its acceptance or rejection,
bjf him. C. C. P., s. 162.

bail (specifying the places of residence and occupation of
the latter) before the court, justice of the peace or judge,
at a specified time and place, the time to be not less than
five nor more than ten days thereafter. In case other bail

The qualifications of bail must be as follows :
(1) Each of them must be a resident and freeholder within
the state ;
(2) They must each be worth the amount specified in
the order of arrest, exclusive of property exempt from exe
cution ; but the judge, on justification, may allow more
than two bail to justify severally in amounts less than that
expressed in the order, if the whole justification be equiva
lent to that of two sufficient bail.
Sec. 307. Justification of bail. C. C. P., s. 165.
For the purpose of justification, each of the bail shall
attend before the court, or judge, or justice of the peace, at
the time and place mentioned in the notice, and may be
examined on oath, on the part of the plaintiff, touching
his sufficiency, in such a manner as the court, the justice
of the peace, or the judge, in his discretion, may think
proper. The examination shall be reduced to writing, and
subscribed by the bail, if required by the plaintiff.
Sec. 308. If bail adjudged sufficient, examination to be
certified, and sheriff exonerated. C. C. P., s. 166.
If the court, justice of the peace or judge find the bail
sufficient, he shall annex the examination to the under

Sec. 309. Defendant may make deposit instead of bail with
sheriff. C. C. P., s. 167.
The defendant may, at the time of his arrest, instead of
giving bail, deposit with the sheriff the amount mentioned
in the order. The sheriff shall thereupon give the defend
ant a certificate of the deposit, and the defendant shall be
discharged from custody.
Sec. 310. Sheriff within four days to pay deposit into court.
C. C. P., s. 168.
The sheriff shall, within four days after the deposit, pay
the same into court, and shall take from the officer receiv
ing the same two certificates of such payment, the one of

same proceedings may be had on the official bond of the
sheriff, to collect the sum deposited, as in other cases of
delinquencies.
Sec. 311. Hail substituted for deposit and deposit refunded.
C. C. P., s. 109.
If money be deposited, as provided in the two preceding
sections, bail may be given and justified upon notice, as

ment of money to the plaintiff, the clerk or other officer
shall, under the direction of the court, apply the same in
satisfaction thereof, and, after satisfying the judgment,
shall refund the surplus, if any, to the defendant. If the
judgment be in favor of the defendant, the clerk or other
officer shall refund to him the whole sum deposited and
remaining unapplied.
Sec. .'t13. Sheriff liable as bail, when . C. C. P., s. 17 1.
If, after being arrested, the defendant escape, or be res
cued, or bail be not given or justified, or a deposit be not

by the giving and justification of bail at any time before
process against the person of the defendant, to enforce an
order or judgment in the action.
Sec. 3 14. Judgment against sheriff; action on his official
bond. C. C, P., s. 172.
If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff upon his
liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned
unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the same proceedings may

deficiency as in other cases of delinquency.

such omission.
Sec. 3 Id. Defendant, before judgment, may apply, on mo
tion, to vacate. C. C. P., s. 174. 188!), c. 4!>7.
A defendant arrested may, at any time before judgment,
apply, on motion, to vacate the order of arrest or to reduce
the amount of bail. And the defendant may, at any time
before judgment, deny, upon oath, the facts alleged in the
affidavit of the plaintiff on which the order of arrest was
granted, and demand that the issue so raised by the plain
tiff's affidavit and the defendant's denial be submitted to
the jury and tried in the same manner as other issues are
tried by a jury; and if the issues are found by the jury in
favor of the defendant, judgment shall be rendered dis
charging the defendant from arrest and vacatiug the order
of arrest, and the defendant shall recover of the plaintiff
all costs of the proceeding in such arrest as he shall have
incurred in defending the said ac:ion.
Note. —All of this section after the word "bail," in the third line, was
added by ch. 499, acts 1887.
Motion must be made before judgment. —A motion to discharge the defend
ant from custody is, in effect, a motion to vacate an order of arrest, and
can only be made before judgment. Roulhac v. Brown, 87-1.
Mover must fully and clearly meet the facts alleged.—When one who has
been arrested moves to vacate the order of arrest upon counter-affidavits,
purporting to meet the facts alleged against him, he should do so fully
and clearly; otherwise the order of arrest will be continued. Powers v.
Davenport, 101-286.
Not ground for motion. —It is no ground for vacating an order of arrest
that the defendant has been indicted, tried and acquitted by the courts
of another state upon the same charge. Powers v. Davenport, 101-286.
If order is not vacated.— If an order of arrest has not been vacated, on
motion, the party in custody may seek his discharge in the manner pro
vided for insolvent debtors. The Code, vol. 2, ch. 27; Wingo v. Hooper,
98-482; Burgwyn v. Hall, 108-489.
Motion, if denied, cannot be renewed. —If a motion to discharge is made
under this section and refused, the defendant is barred from renewing
the motion or moving to vacate the order of arrest. It is res judicata.
Roulhac v. Brown, 87-1; Wingo v. Hooper, 98-482.

or for an insufficient cause. Bear v. Cohen, 65-511.
When an order of arrest has been granted without an undertaking
having been filed as required by \ 294, ante, it will be vacated, on motion,
though the plaintiff may be suing as a pauper. Rowark v. Homesley,
68-91.
Jury trial.—A party, under arrest in a civil action, moving to vacate
the order upon affidavits submitted to the court, is not entitled to a trial
by jury upon the question of fact raised. Wingo v. Hooper, 98-482.
Note. —This is now otherwise by the amendment of this section, above
stated.
Appeal from justice of the peace. —An appeal from a justice of the peace
discharging one arrested in civil action, vacates the judgment, and the
order of arrest continues in force pending the appeal. Patton v. Gash,
99-280.
Sec. 317. Motion to vacate made on affidavit; plaintiff
may oppose the same by affldavitsor other proof. C. C. P.,
s. 175.
If the motion be made upon affidavits on the part of the
defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the
same by affidavits, or other proof, in addition to those on
which the order of arrest was made.
Amendment of affidavit. —Refusal to allow an amended affidavit to be
filed when the defendant does not move on affidavit, is a matter of dis
cretion, which the court will not review. Wilson v. Barnhill, 64-121.
Additional affidavits. —When an order of arrest has been issued upon an
insufficient affidavit, and the defendant instead of moving to dismiss on
the ground of its apparent insufficiency files a counter-affidavit, the
plaintiff may file other affidavits, which, if sufficient, shall operate to
cure the defects of the original. Clark v. Clark, 64-150.
Where the defendant moves to vacate the order upon the ground that
it was irregularly or improvidently granted, the plaintiff will not be
allowed to offer additional evidence in support of his application ; but if
the defendant moves to vacate upon counter proofs, the plaintiff may
produce further evidence. Harris v. Sneeden, 101-273 ; Bear v. Cohen,
65-511.
Order should not be vacated on a simple denial. —If the order was properly
granted it ought not to be vacated upon a simple denial of the alleged
cause of action ; but where the answer or counter-affidavits meet the
allegations of the plaintiff fully and in detail, and furnish convincing
evidence of their truth, the order should be vacated. Harris v. Sneeden,
Validity of order of arrest, how determined. —The validity of an order "of
arrest and warrant of attachment is determined upon facts alleged in the
original affidavit and existing at the time when the proceeding was insti
tuted, not upon new matter which may afterwards transpire. Devries

mitted to jail, at any time before final judgment, the sheriff,

Sec. 319. Bail to pay costs in certain cases. 1t. C, c. 1 1, x.

The plaintiff, in an action to recover the possession of
personal property, may, at the time of issuing the sum
mons, or at any time before answer, claim the immediate
delivery of such property, as provided in this sub-chapter.
Summons must issue. —The order can only be granted simultaneously
with, or after the issue of summons commencing an action between the
parties. Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516.
The issue of a summons is necessary, in order to give the clerk juris
diction to issue the order. Potter v. Mardre, 74-36.
If the plaintiff is content to let the property remain in the hands of
the defendant, pending the action, he is not required to make the affi
davit. It is then, in effect, the old action of delinue, and the judg
ment is that set out in \ 431, " for the possession or for the value, in case
delivery cannot be had, and damages for the detention," etc. Jarmau
v. Ward, 67-32.
If plaintiff gives the bond this proceeding is a substitute for the old
action of replevin; if he does not give the bond, it is a substitute for
delinue or trover. Hopper v. Miller, 76-402.
Fraudulent sale.—On a sale of goods, induced by fraud on the part of
the vendee, claim and delivery lies for the recovery of the property by
the vendor. Wilson v. White, 80-280.

to pay for her in services, but before they are rendered he dies, an action
for claim and delivery will not lie to recover the cow. McCraw v. Gil
mer, 83-162.
Where defendant is not in possession. —Action does not lie, if the defend
ant is not in possession of the property when suit brought. Haughton
v. Newberry, 69-456.
Claim and delivery is not maintainable against one who has neither
possession nor control of the property sought to be recovered, but who
has sold and delivered it to another party before suit brought. Webb v.
Taylor, 80-305.
If defendant gets possession after judgment.—Where, in claim and delivery,
the plaintiff takes possession of the property, and a judgment is entered,
by consent, that he is entitled to the possession, and the defendant, by
some means, subsequently gets possession of the property, the plaintiff
is entitled to an execution to retake it. Aldridge v. Loftin, 104-122.
Where a delivery cannot be had. —When the property cannot be re-deliv
ered in specie, the value thereof, upon recovery, should be assessed as of
the time of trial, and not as of the time of seizure by the sheriff. Holmes
v. Godwin, 69-467.
In an action for claim and delivery of a horse, which died in defend
ant's possession after action brought, the plaintiff cannot recover any
thing except for the hire of the horse, and only then if the death was
caused by the negligence of the defendant. Williamson v. Buck, 80-308.
Where a delivery is not had, the suit can still be prosecuted for the
recovery of the value of the property in damages. Miller v. Hahn, 84226.
Interest. —Interest is not allowed, as a matter of law, in claim and
delivery, but the jury can, iu their discretion, allow as damages interest
on the value of the property from the time it was taken. Patapsco v.
.Magee, 86-350.
Landlord and tenant. —Where the lessor by his own acts gets possession
of the crop, the remedy of the lessee is by claim and delivery to recover
his part thereof. Wilson v. Respass, 86-112.
Where the lessee sues the lessor in claim and delivery for his part of
the crop, and the lessor is solvent, an injunction to restrain such lessor
from selling the crop will not be granted. Ibid.
The landlord may bring an action of claim and delivery to recover
possession of crops raised by the tenant or cropper, where his right of pos
session under The Code, \ 1754, is denied ; or he may resort to any other
appropriate remedy to enforce his lien for the rent and advances made.
The action will lie, not only in case of a removal of the crops from the
land leased, but also where the tenant or cropper, or any other person,
takes the crops into his absolute possession and denies the right of the
landlord thereto. Livingston v. Farish, 89-140.
The landlord cannot bring claim and delivery for crop before the time
fixed for division, unless the tenant is about to remove or dispose of the
crop, or abandon a growing crop. Jordan v. Bryan, 103-59.
When there is no time fixed for the division of the crop, the landlord
can maintain an action of claim and delivery for the crop to pay rent
and advancements before the whole crop is gathered, or the end of the
year. Smith v. Tindall, 107-88.
Ungathered crops. —Claim and delivery can be brought for a certain
number of pounds of cotton, though it is ungathered in the field, and
the officer can employ hands and have the requisite number of pounds
picked out. Patapsco v. McGee, 86-350.
Between tenants in common,—An action of claim and delivery by one
tenant in common against another, to recover possession of personal property, cannot be maintained. Powell v. Hill, 64-169. Unless the
property has been destroyed or carried beyond the limits of the state,
when he may recover its value. Strauss v. Crawford, 89-149; Grim v.
Wicker, 83-343.
Where one co-tenant was present forbidding the other from removing
the common property, no demand was necessary before bringing suit.
Waller v. Bowling, 108-289.
If one tenant in common of a chattel oust his co-tenant of possession,
the latter may, at his election, bring an action for the recovery of the
specific property, if it can be found, and damages for its deterioration,
or for the conversion and value at the time of taking. After suit is
brought for conversion, the defendant cannot relieve himself from lia
bility by returning the property, unless the plaintiff agrees to receive
it. Ibid.
Purchaser for value without notice. —Where A sold to B a buggy, and
delivered it to a common carrier to be delivered to B upon the payment of
the price ; the carrier negligently permitted B to obtain possession with
out paying the price, and while in possession B sold to C, who was a
purchaser' for value, without notice, claim and delivery will not lie.
Railroad v. Barnes, 104-25.
Between mortgagor and mortgagee.— In an action brought by a mortgagor
to redeem mortgaged chattels, a balance was adjudged to be due the
. mortgagee, and he was ordered to cancel the mortgage upon receipt of
such balance, but no foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property was
ordered ; such judgment was res judicata as to the balance due the
mortgagee, but was not a bar to a separate action of claim and delivery,
brought by the mortgagee to recover the mortgaged chattels, nor was
the mortgagee confined to a motion in the cause, in the action for
redemption, for his remedy. Gulley v. Copeland, 102-326.
Where a mortgage has been made on a crop sown, but not yet grow
ing, claim and delivery lies in favor of the mortgagee for the crop when
matured. Cotten v. Willoughby, 83-75.
Will not lie. —Claim and delivery will not lie to recover logs that had
been severed from plaintiff's land, while the defendant wasin posssesion
claiming title ; nor will trover lie for the conversion of crops by one in
adverse possession of land. The remedy in such cases is by action of
trespass for mesne profits. Harrison v. Hoff, 102-126.
Ancillary remedy and optional. —Strictly speaking, there is no such action
under The Code as "claim and delivery," The action is for the recov
ery of a specific chattel, and the delivery of the chattel is a provisional
remedy—ancillary—but not essential to such action. If the plaintiff
see fit, delivery of the chattel may be waived and the action prosecuted
to recover possession of the chattel, as in the old action of delinue, or
to recover the value of the property, as in trover or trespass. Wilson v.
Hughes, 94-182,
Plaintiff may elect to bring trover.—An owner of property, deprived of
possession, who regains the same, may, in an action brought against
him, and as full defence thereto, show his title to the property, notwith
standing that, in the recaption, he may have committed an act calcu
lated to produce a breach of the peace. A plaintiff claiming such prop
erty is not restricted to " claim and delivery," but may bring an action
in the nature of trover. Alsbrook v. Shields, 67-333.
Plaintiff put in possession. —When plaintiff is put in possession by pro
cess under this chapter, he cannot move to dismiss and cut defendant
off from his defence. Manix v. Howard, 82-125.
Dismissed for irregularity.—Where the proceeding is dismissed for irreg
ularity, the title to the property cannot be brought in question on an
inquisition of damages against the plaintiff. Manix v. Howard, 79-553.
Demurrer does not admit a lieu. —Where the answer, in an action for
claim and delivery, alleges a lien on the property, a demurrer to the
answer does not admit the lien. Mauney v. Ingram, 78-96.
Usury a defence. —Usury can be pleaded in defence to this proceeding,
where the claim and delivery is for articles conveyed by mortgage.
Moore v. Woodard, 83-531.
Right to intervene. —In an action of claim and delivery a third party
claiming such' property loses his right to be made a party to the suit
after the lapse of three years, without applying to be made a party.
Queere, whether an appeal lies in favor of the claimant from the refusal
of the application by the judge. Clemmons v. Hampton, 70-534.
See \ 331, post.
Against a sheriff. —A sheriff is liable in an action of claim and delivery
for property seized for taxes after the expiration of the time limited by
law for their collection. Ray v. Horton, 77-334.
An action of claim and delivery of personal property can be main
tained by the owner against an officer taking the same under an execu
tion against a third person Jones v. Ward, 77-337 ; Churchill v. Leet
77-341.
Effect of judgment. —A judgment in action of claim and delivery will
not bar a subsequent action between the same parties, seeking to recover
damages for the taking and conversion of such property. Woody v.
Jordan, 69-189; Asher v. Reizenstein, 105-213.
Before justice of the peace. —In an action before a justice of the peace
for the recovery of the value or return of property, it must be averred
in the summons that the value thereof does not exceed fifty dollars.
Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
Sec. 322. Affidavit and requisite». C. C. P., s. 177. 1881,
c. 134.
Where a delivery is claimed, an affidavit must be made,
before the clerk of the court in which the action is required
to be tried, or before some person competent to administer
oaths, by the plaintiff, or some one in his behalf, showing :
Affidavit will not be treated as a complaint. —The affidavit filed prelimi
nary to obtaining requisition for the seizure and delivery of property
will not be treated as a complaint, and its averments cannot cure a
defect in the summons or complaint. Singer Manufacturing Co. v.
Barrett, 95-36.
Affidavit, when necessary.—It is only in cases where the plaintiff seeks
to have the property delivered to him instanter, and to have the posses
sion pending the action, as in the old action of replevin, that the affida
vit is required. Jarmau v. Ward, 67-32.
Affidavit must conform strictly. —The affidavit must conform strictly to
all the requirements of the statute. Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516.
(1) That the plaintiff is the owner of the property claimed
(particularly describing it), or is lawfully entitled to the
possession thereof by virtue of a special property therein,
the facts in respect to which shall be set forth ;
Bailee.—One in the rightful possession of property as a bailee, is
entitled to an order against a wrong-doer who has deprived him of pos
session. Hopper v. Miller, 76-402.
Property must be capable of identification. —When a party has expended
labor on another's property, so as to change its specific character, as
distilling corn into whiskey, the owner of the original article cannot
have an order to seize the product. Potter v. Marnre, 74-36.
In an action to recover personal property, whether the provisional
remedy is resorted to or not, the plaintiff must show a right to the pos
session of specific property which may be identified. A mortgage of
"ten new buggies " by one who has a larger number of new buggies in
his possession, without other description, does not convey title to any
particular ones nor create a right on which an action for possession may
be maintained. Blakeley v. Patrick, 67-40.
Confusion of goods. —Where one wrongfully mixes his own goods with
anothers, such other can recover them as mixed where it is impossible
to distinguish the articles. Queen v. Wernwag, 97-383.
(2) That the property is wrongfully detained by the
defendant ;
If defendant not in possession. —The provisional remedy of claim and
delivery is not maintainable against one who has neither possession nor
control of property, but has sold it to another. Webb v Taylor, 80-305 ;
Haughton v. Newberry, 69-456.
(3) The alleged cause of the detention thereof, according
to his best knowledge, information and belief;
(4) That the same has not been taken for tax, assess
ment or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an
execution or attachment against the property of the plain
tiff ; or, if so seized, that it is, by statute, exempt from
such seizure; and
Note. —By act 1887 (ch. 137), re-enacted 1889 and 1891 (ch. 323, § 78),
it is provided:
No person shall be permitted to recover, by claim and
delivery or other process, any property taken or distrained
by the sheriff or any tax-collector for the non-payment of
any tax, except such tax be levied or assessed for an illegal
or unauthorized purpose.

Execution. - An affidavit which fails to state that the property has not
been taken under execution, or to give its value, is fatally defective.

a sheriff under levy, and have delivery thereof under this chapter. Jones
v. Ward, 77-337; Churchill v. Lee. 77-341.

under this chapter. Baxter v. Baxter, 77-118.
(5) The actual value of the property.
Affidavit must state actual value. —The affidavit in claim and delivery
must state the actual value of the property. Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516.
Before a juBtice of the peace. —Where, in an action of claim and delivery,
it appears that the value of the property exceeds fifty dollars, it at once
ousts the jurisdiction of the justice, and the plaintiff cannot confer
jurisdiction by a remitter. Noville v. Dew, 94-43.
Where, in an action of claim and delivery begun before a justice, the
jury found the value of the property to be over fifty dollars, but that the
plaintiff was entitled to the possession, the justice had no jurisdiction,
and the action should be dismissed and the property restored to the
defendant. Ibid. Unless amendment allowed. Mfg. Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
Where a landlord brought an action before a justice of the peace to
recover the sum of eighty dollars alleged to be due upon a contract for
rent, and, ancillary thereto, procured an order for the seizure and deliv
ery to him of certain crops of greater value than fifty dollars: Held, (1)
the question of the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace is determined
by the summons and complaint, especially the former; (2) the order for
the seizure and delivery of the property was coram non judice, but did
not oust the jurisdiction of the court over the cause of action. Morris
v. O'Briant, 94-72.
Sec. 323. Fiat of clerk to sheriff, to deliver property. C. C.
P., s. 178.
The clerk of the court shall thereupon, by an endorse

the county where the property claimed may be, to take the
same from the defendant and deliver it to the plaintiff :
Provided, the plaintiff shall give the undertaking pre
scribed in the succeeding section.

action for claim and delivery of personal property, there must be a compliance with all the requisites of this sub-chapter. Hirsh v. Whitehead,
65-516.
Issued before summons.—An order granted before issue of summons is
no justification to the sheriff or party obtaining it for any action done
under it. Potter v. Mardre, 74-36.
Against one tenant In common. —When the sheriff seizes goods under this
chapter, which belong to several parties in common, he becomes, pro
hac vice, a tenant in common with the other joint owners, and it is well
settled that a tenant in common in personalty cannot maintain an action
to recover goods from his co-tenant. Insurance Co. v. Davis, 68-17.
Amendment of order. —Such requisition can be amended, but not after
third parties have acquired rights which may be prejudiced by the
amendment. Phillips v. Holland, 78-31.

is authorized to take the affidavit of the plaintiff and to order the seizure
of personal property in an action for claim and delivery. Jackson v.
Buchanan, 89-74.
Irregular process. —A process which is set aside for irregularity, is no
justification to the plaintiff or his attorneys and aiders, for acts done
under it. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189.
Objection too late after answer. —Where an order to seize property in an
action for claim and delivery was signed by an unsworn deputy clerk,
who had never been formally inducted into office, but the objection was
not made until after an answer to the merits had been filed, it was too
late. Butts v. Screws, 95-215.
Sec. 324. Undertaking of plaintifffor delivery of property.
C. C. P., s. 179. 1885, c. 50, ». I.
Upon the receipt of the order from the clerk, with a

one or more sufficient sureties, approved by the sheriff, to
the effect they are bound in double the value of the prop
erty, as stated in the affidavit for the prosecution of the
action, for the return of the property to the defendant, with
damages for its deterioration and detention, if return can
be had, and if for any cause return cannot be had, for the
payment to him of such sum as may be recovered against
the plaintiff for the value of the property at the time of the
seizure, with interest thereon as damages for such seizure
and detention, the sheriff shall forthwith take the property
described in the affidavit, if it be in the possession of the
defendant or his agent, and retain it in his custody. He
shall also, without delay, serve on the defendant a copy o the affidavit, notice and undertaking, by delivering the
same to him personally, if he can be found, or to his agent,
from whose possession the property is taken ; or, if neither
can be found, by leaving them at the usual place of abode
of either, with some person of suitable age and discretion.
Note. —The section as it stands embraces the amendment (ch. 50, acts
1885) which requires the bond to cover damages for deterioration and
detention, as well as for the value of the property and interest.
As amended. —This section, as amended, prescribes a form of replevin
bond peculiarly adapted to cases where the title to specific personal
property is at issue, and the full value of the property is the just alterna
tive of damages when the property is not delivered. But where the
action is brought by mortgagee to sell and satisfy his debt, or a counter
claim is set up, the court can frame the judgment to do justice and pre
vent oppression. Taylor v. Hodges, 105-344.
Plaintiff need not give bond. —The plaintiff can bring suit and not give
bond, as required by this section, if he does not ask for possession of
property before judgment. Jarmau v. Ward, 67-32.
Sec. 325. Inceptions to undertaking. C. C. P%, s. 180.
The defendant may, within three days after the service
of a copy of the affidavit and undertaking, give notice to
the sheriff personally, or by leaving a copy at his office in
the county town of the county," or, if he have no such offiee,
at the office of the clerk of the court, that he excepts to the
sufficiency of the sureties. If he fail to do so, he shall be
deemed to have waived all objection to them. When the
defendant excepts, the sureties shall justify on notice, in
like manner as upon bail on arrest. And the sheriff shall
be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties, until the
objection to them is either waived as above provided, or
until they shall justify, or vtntil new sureties shall be sub
stituted and justify. If the defendant except to the sure
ties he cannot reclaim the property as provided in the suc
ceeding section.
Sec. 320. Undertaking of defendant to retain property.
C. C. P., », 181. 1885, c. 50, s. 2.
At any time before the delivery of the property to the
plaintiff, the defendant may, if he do not except to the
sureties of the plaintiff, require the return thereof, upon
giving to the sheriff a written undertaking, payable to the
plaintiff, executed by one or more sufficient sureties, to the
effect that they are bound in double the value of the prop
erty, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff, for the deliv
ery thereof to the plaintiff, with damages for its deteriora
tion and its detention, if delivery can be had, and if such
delivery cannot, for any cause, be had, for the payment to
him of such sum as may be recovered against the defendant
for the value of the property at the time of the wrongful tak
ing or detention, with interest thereon, as damages for such
taking and detention. If a return of the property be not
so required within three days after the taking and service
of notice to the defendant, it shall be delivered to the
plaintiff, except as provided in section three hundred and
thirty -one.
Note. —The above section, as it stands, embraces the amendment (ch.
50, acts 1885) requiring the bond to cover the damages and interest, as
well as value of the property. See §324, ante, for similar amendment
as to plaintiff's undertaking.
Amendment. —The effect of the amendment is to make the condition of
the bond therein provided for harmonious with the judgment authorized
by the law regulating proceedings in claim and delivery, Hall v. Till
man, 103-276.
Sureties liable. —When, in claim and delivery, the parties compromise
and agree upon a judgment for a definite sum and costs in lien of an
order of restitution, such judgment is binding on the sureties to the
plaintiff's undertaking. Council v. Averett, 90-168.
Sureties not liable. —The sureties to an undertaking, on behalf of the
defendant, in claim and delivery, are not liable for any debt which plain
tiff may recover in the action. Hall v. Tillman, 103-276.
Improper bond taken, sheriff liable. —Where, in claim and delivery, the
sheriff returned to the defendant the property and only took from him a
bond to indemnify the sheriff, and not such a bond as this section
requires, it is a breach of the sheriff's official bond, which renders him
and his sureties liable at once to an action by the plaintiff. Hughes v.
Newsom, 86-424.
Property disposed of by defendant after suit brought.—Where it is in evi
dence, in an action of claim and delivery, that the defendant has, since
suit brought, disposed of the property, the plaintiff can recover the value
of the property at the time of the demand. Miller v. Hahn, 84-226.
Sec. 227. Justification of defendant's sureties. C. C. P.,
s. 182.
The defendant's sureties, upon a notice to the plaintiff of
not less than two or more than six days, shall justify before
the court, a judge or justice of the peace, in the same man
ner as upon bail on arrest. Upon such justification the
sheriff shall deliver the property to the defendant. The
sheriff shall be responsible for the defendant's sureties, until
they justify, or until justification is completed or expressly
waived, aud may retain the property until that time ; but
if they, or others in their place, fail to justify at the time
and place appointed, he shall deliver the property to the
plaintiff.
Sec. 328. Qualification and Justification of defendant's
sureties, how. C. C. P., s. 183.

his possession ; and, if necessary, he may call to his aid the
powers of his county, and if the property be upon the per
son the sheriff or other officer may seize the person, and
search for and take the same.
Officer can break open doors. —An officer cannot break open the door of a
house and enter therein, without the consent of the owner, for the pur
pose of executing civil process, except when acting under a requisition in
claim and delivery where the property has been concealed, in which case
special provision has been made by statute. State v. Whitaker, 107-802.
Sec. 330. Property when taken, how kept. C. C. P., s. 185.

grounds of such right and title, and upon his delivering to
the sheriff an undertaking in an amount double the value
of the property specified in plaintiff's complaint, for the
delivery of the property to the person entitled to the same,
and for the payment of all such costs and damages as may

affidavits that they are each worth double the value of
property. A copy of this undertaking and accompanying
affidavits to be served by the sheriff on the plaintiff and
defendant at least ten days before the return day of the sum
mons in said action, when the court, trying the same, shall
order a jury to be empaneled to inquire in whom is the right
to the property specified in the plaintiff's complaint; and
the finding of the jury shall be conclusive as to the parties
then in court, and the court shall adjudge accordingly,
unless it is reversed on appeal. Provided, that in a court
of a justice of the peace he may try such issue, unless a jury
be demanded, and then proceedings are to be conducted, in
all respects, as in jury trials before courts of justices of the
peace.
Right to intervene. —The right of an outside claimant to intervene is
well settled by precedent. Sims v. Goettle, 82-268.
Intervener must give bond before receiving the property—The judge of the
superior court has no right, upon the affidavit of a third party claiming
the ownership of the goods, to order their delivery to him without secu
rity. Bear v. Cohen, 65-511.
Loss of right to intervene.—A third party claiming the property, loses
his right by allowing three years to elapse after filing his petition to

claims the property can appeal from an order of the court refusing his
application to interplead. Ibid.

mitted to the jury is as to the title to the property levied on. After
property is taken, it is, until replevied, in the hands of the officer, in
the custody of the law. McLean v. Douglas, 28-233.
Burden on interpleader. —In proceedings in attachment, one who inter
pleads under this section, is an actor, upon whom rests the burden of
proving his title to the property he claims. And this is so although the
property was in his possession when seized by the sheriff. Wallace v.
Robeson, 100-206.
Sec. 332. Sheriff not bound to keep the property, but may
deliver to claimant. R. C, c. 7, s. 10. 1810, c. 583, ss. 1,
2. C. C. P., B. 186(a).

Sec. 333. Undertaking and affidavit, when and where to be
filed. C. C. r., s. 187.
The sheriff shall return the undertaking, notice and affi
davit with his proceedings thereon to the court in which
the action is pending within ten days after taking the prop
erty mentioned therein.
Summary judgment against sureties.—A summary judgment may be
rendered upon the undertaking against the sureties, at the time of trial.
Insurance Co. v. Davis. 74-78 ; Harker v. Arendell, 74-85 ; Council v.
Averett, 90-168; Robbins v. Killebrew, 95-19.

ties on an undertaking to retain the property in an action of claim and
delivery, but the judgment must be such as is authorized by The Code,
3326, (as amended by ch. 50, laws 1885) and §431. Hall v. Tillman,
103-276.
All requirements must be complied with. —All the requirements of this
sub-chapter must be complied with to entitle a party to maintain an
action for claim and delivery. Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516.
As regards the verdict and judgment, in actions to recover
specific personal property, embracing all cases in which the aid of this
provisional remedy can be invoked, see ^409 and 431, post, and the
cases and notes under them.
Sec. 334. Injunction as a provisional remedy abolished,
and injunction by order substituted. C. C. P., s. 188.
The writ of injunction as a provisional remedy is abol
ished, and a temporary injunction by order is substituted
therefor. The order may be made by any judge of a
superior court, in the cases provided in section three hun
dred and thirty-eight, and may be enforced as the order of
the court. Upon such order, it shall be issued by the
clerk of the court in which the action is required to be
tried.
Note.—The following should probably be inserted at this place :
Injunction, when granted to restrain collection of taxes.
1887, c. 137, 8. 84. 1880, c. 218, 8. 82. 1801, c. 323, 8. 78.
No injunction shall be granted by any court or judge in
this state to restrain the collection of any tax, or any part
thereof, hereafter levied, nor to restrain the sale of any
property for the non-payment of any such tax, except such
tax, or the part thereof enjoined, be levied or assessed for
an illegal or unauthorized purpose, or be illegal or invalid,
or the assessment be illegal or invalid; nor shall any person
be permitted to recover by claim and delivery or other pro
cess any property taken or distrained by the sheriff or any
tax-collector for the non-payment of any tax, except such
tax be levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized pur
pose; but in every case the person or persons claiming any
tax, or any part thereof, to be for any reason invalid, or
that the valuation of his property is excessive or unequal,
who shall pay the same to the tax-collector or other proper
authority in all respects as though the same was legal and
valid, such person may, at any time within thirty days
after such payment, demand the same in writing from the
treasurer of the state, or of the county, city or town for the
benefit or under the authority or by the request of which
the same was levied, and if the same shall not be refunded
within ninety days thereafter, may sue such county, city
or town for the amount so demanded, including in his suit
against the county both state and county tax; and if upon
the trial it shall be determined that such tax, or any part
thereof, was levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized
purpose, or was for any reason invalid or excessive, judg
ment shall be rendered therefor, with interest, and the same
shall be collected as in other cases, and the amount of state
tax overpaid or declared invalid certified by the clerk and
refunded by the state treasurer.
And, also:
Regulating bond on injunction against railroad tariffs and
rates, s. 7' c. 320, acts 1891 (the Railroad Commission act).
No judge shall grant an injunction, restraining order or
other process staying or affecting, during the pending of
such appeal, the enforcement of any such determination of
said board fixing rates or fares without requiring as a con
dition precedent the executing and filing with said board a
justified undertaking in the sum of not less than twentyfive thousand dollars for all companies whose road is of less
length than fifty miles, and fifty thousand dollars for com
panies whose road is over fifty miles in length, conditioned
that the company will make and file with said board a
sworn statement, every three months during the pending
of said appeal, of the items of freight, with names of ship
pers, carried over said company's road within the preceding
ninety days, showing the freight charged and those fixed
by said board; and that, in the event the determination of
said board • appealed from is affirmed, in part or in whole,
the said company shall, within thirty days, pay into the
treasury of North Carolina the aggregate difference between
the freights collected and those fixedby the final determina
tion of the matter appealed. Whenever the aggregate dif
ference between the freights collected and those fixed by
the board shall equal or exceed the sum specified in said
undertaking, the said board shall notify the appellant or
appellants that another justified undertaking in like sum
and with the same conditions as aforesaid is required to be
executed and filed with said board. A failure to file with
said board the sworn statement provided for in this section,
or any one of them when more than one is required or
asked for, or a failure to give an additional undertaking,
when required, within fifteen days from notice so to do,
shall vacate and render null and void any restraining order,
injunction or other process to stay the enforcement of any
determination of said board as to schedules of rates, etc.
Restraining order for more than twenty days. —An order to stay proceed
ings, made without notice, by a judge out of court, for a longer time
than twenty days, is irregular, and a demurrer to the complaint in the
action may be treated as a motion to dismiss. Foard v. Alexander,
64-69.
Remedy by motion in the cause. —While an action is pending, relief should
be had hy a defendant, aggrieved by any judgment, by applying to the
court in which it was rendered for a modification of the same, and for a
supersedeas or other stay of proceedings, and not by an injunction.
Chambers v. Peuland, 78-53 ; Jones v. Cameron, 81-154.
Relief cannot be allowed upon a new action asking an injunction when
could be had by a motion in the original cause. Faison v. Mcllwaine,
72—313 ; Mason v. Miles, 63-564; Jarman v. Saunders, 64-367.'
An injunction will not be granted where the same matter is involved
in another suit pending between the same parties, in which relief can be
had. Grant v. Moore, 88-77. See \ 594, post.
Another motion for injunction pending. —A pending and undecided motion
for an injunction and receiver in one action excludes the interference of
the court in another, especially at the instance of one who is competent
to become a party to, and receive redress in, the first action. Young v.
Rollins, 85-485.
Applicant for an injunction must make full discovery. —The court will require
the party applying for an injunction to make a full discovery of facts,
and use perfect candor in alleging them. Phifer v. Barnhart, 88-333.
Distinction between common and special injunctions. —Distinction between
common and special injunctions, under the former practice, drawn, and
their application to the provisional remedy shown. Heilig v. Stokes,
63-612.
Injunction will not be granted if there is another remedy.—Under The Code
practice, an injunction is still an extraordinary and provisional remedy,
and it will not be granted before the plaintiff has exhausted the ordinary
remedies, unless the court can plainly see that the plaintiff is about to
suffer an irreparable injury. Frink v. Stewart, 94-4S4.
May issue after summons and before judgment.—The jurisdiction to issue
injunctions and restraining orders may be exercised at any time after
the commencement of the action and before judgment. Fleming v. Pat
terson, 99-404.
Action not dismissed because injunction refused. —It is error to dimiss an
action, upon refusing an injunction till the hearing. Bradshaw v.
Com'rs, 92-278.
Powers of court enlarged.— The powers of the court as to injunctions
and receivers have been enlarged by The Code. Lumber Co. v. Wallace,
93-22.
Sec. H.'iS. What judge to grant injunction* and restraining
orders. I870->7, c. 232, 8. 1. 1879, c. 63, «». 1, 3.
The judges of the superior court of this state shall have
jurisdiction to grant injunctions and issue restraining orders
in all civil actions and proceedings which are authorized
by law : Provided, that a judge holding a special term in
auy county may grant an injunction or issue a restraining
order, returnable before himself, in any case which he may
have jurisdiction to hear and determine, under the com
mission issued to him, and the same shall be returnable as
directed by the judge in the order.
Previous to act of 1876-7.—The practice, under this section, previous to
the act of i876-'7, was, in effect, that any judge of a superior court
might issue an injunction order or order of restraint, but only the judge
of the district in which the county was located, where the action was
triable, could hear a motion to modify or vacate such an order. Mauney
v. Com'rs, 71-486.
Under the present act. —Under the act as modified by ch. 65, acts of 1879,
a motion for an injunction may be made before the resident judge of the
district, or one assigned to the district, or one holding the courts thereof
by exchange, at the option of the mover. Corbin v. Berry, 83-27.
It seems that any judge has jurisdiction anywhere iu the state to
grant a restraining order. State v. Ray, 97-510.
Against receiver.—The superior court of one county will not abate by
injunction a nuisance erected by a corporation which is in the hands of
a receiver appointed by the superior court of another county. Brown v.
Railroad, 83-128.
See. 330. Before what judge returnable. 1870-'7, e. 232,
s. 2. 1879, c. 035. ss. 2, 3. 188J, c. 51, s. 1.
All restraining orders and injunctions granted by any of
the judges of the superior court, except a judge holding a
special term in any county, shall be made returnable before
the resident judge of the district or the judge assigned to
the district, or holding by exchange the courts of the dis
trict where the civil action or special proceeding is depend
ing, within twenty days from the date of order. And if the
judge before whom the same is returned shall, from sick
ness, inability, or from any cause, fail to hear said motion
and application, or to continue the same to some other time
and place, then it shall be competent for any judge resident
in some adjoining district, or the judge assigned to hold
the court of some adjoining district, or the judge holding
by exchange the court of some adjoining district, to hear and
determine the said motion and application, after giving ten
days' notice to the parties interested in the application or
motion, upon its being satisfactorily shown to him by affi
davit or otherwise that the judge before whom the same
was returnable failed to act upon the same or to continue
the same to some other time and place. The effect of such
removal shall be to continue in force the motion and appli
cation theretofore granted, till the same can be heard and
determined by the judge having jurisdiction of the same.
Under the acts of 1879 and 1881.—Under the acts of 1879 restraining
orders must be made returnable at some place in the district in which
the action is pending, and before the resident judge or the judge hold
ing the courts therein. By the act of 1881 the judge of an adjoining
district may, in certain cases (specified in above section), hear the appli
cation. Galbreath v. Everett, 84-546.
Waiver of irregularity. —An irregularity in making a restraining order
returnable at a point outside the district where the action is pending, is
waived by failure to make the objection in apt time. Ibid.
Resident judge. —Where the judge assigued to hold the courts of a dis
trict granted a restraining order, with a rule to show cause, returnable
on a day after the close of the circuit, and before the resident judge of
the district : Held, not to be erroneous, and that the resident judge
thereby acquired jurisdiction of the matter. Stith v. Jones, 101-360.
De facto judge. —Where the governor issues a commission to one of the
judges of the superior courts, authorizing him to hold certain terms of
the superior courts, and the judge undertakes to discharge the duties
required of him, he is, so far as the public and third persons are con
cerned, a de facto judge so long as he assumes to act in that capacity ;
and this is so although the commission was issued without authority of
law. State v. Lewis, 107-967.
Sec. 337' Parties to application for injunction may by
written stipulation, designate a judge to hear the same.
1883, c. 33.
By a stipulation in writing, signed by all the parties to
an application for an injunction order, or their attorney, to
the effect that the matter may be heard before any judge,
to be designated in such stipulation, the judge before whom
the restraining order is returnable by law, or who is by law
the judge to hear the motion for an injunction order, shall,
upon receipt of such stipulations, forward the same and all
the papers to the judge designated in the stipulation, whose
duty it shall thereupon be to hear and decide the matter,
and return all the papers to the court out of which they
issued : Provided, that the necessary postage or expressage
money be furnished to said judge.

trees;
Not a matter of discretion. —The granting or refusing an order of injunc
tion is not a mere matter of discretion in the judge, and either party may
appeal ; so that a second motion for injunction, upon the same grounds,
should not be heard. Jones v. Thorne, 80-72.
Second application. —The denial of an application for injunction on
account of the want of a material averment, is no obstacle to granting a
second similar application sufficient in form and supported by evidence.
Halcombe v. Com'rs, 89-346.
Contra, if application is made a second time upon substantially the
same averment. Jones v. Thorne, 8o-72.
Delay. —When, as in this case, a variety of remedies was open to plain
tiff for many years and he did not pursue any of them, he is chargeable
with gross laches, and the courts will not interfere by injunction for his
relief. Moore v. Mining Co., 104-534.
Canse of action must be alleged. —The plaintiff must allege facts sufficient
to sustain his cause 0f action, before an injunction will be allowed. Moore
v. Mining Co., 104-534.
Upon an application for an injunction, it is not sufficient to simply
allege that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable damage ; he must set out
the facts so the court may determine the necessity for its intervention.
Lewis v. Lumber Co., 99-1 1.
Where adequate compensation can be had by action for damages. —A restrain
ing order will not be granted where adequate compensation can be had
by an action for damages. Hettrick v. Page, 82-65 ; Walton v. Mills,
86-280; Lewis v. Lumber Co., 99-11.
Where damage will result from refusal, and none from granting. —Where the
granting of an injunction can work harm to neither party, and a refusal
to grant it will subject one of the parties to further litigation, costs and
trouble, the injunction should be granted till the hearing. McCorkle v.
Brem, 76-407.
While the court is slow to pass upon disputed issues upon ex parte affi
davits, yet where, in a motion to continue a restraining order to the hear
ing, it appears that the injury sought to be enjoined, is continuous, and
the damage very difficult of ascertainment, or when the damage is irrep
arable, the court will act upon the proofs, and continue the restraining
order, if an apparent case is made out, unless continuing the order to
the hearing would work greater injury to the defendant than is reason
ably necessary for the protection of the plaintiff. Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, 94-425Where no damage can result from a refusal. —An injunction will not be
granted where no injury, will result to the plaintiff from refusing.
Railroad v. Railroad, 88-79.
Where injunctive relief is the relief itself, and not auxiliary. —When the
injunctive relief sought is not merely auxiliary to the principal relief
demanded in the action, but is the relief itself, the court will not dis
solve the injunction upon a preliminary hearing. Lowe v. Commis
sioners, 70-532'; Marshall v. Commissioners, 89-103.
Against a mere trespass. —The entry on land that a court can enjoin is
only an entry under force or color of legal process. It will not enjoin
a mere trespass, unless irreparable damage is threatened. Germaii v.
Clark, 71-417.
An injunction to restrain the defendant from committing trespasses
on land alleged to belong to the plaintiff, will not be granted, when it is
apparent from the complaint and affidavits that the trespasses are very
trifling, and if continued will not work irreparable injury to the plain
tiff. Frink v. Stewart, 94-484.
Against issuing grant. —An injunction will not be granted to restrain
the issuance of a grant, upon the ground of irregularity in the entries
upon which it is to be based, upon the application of one who has not
title himself to the premises, especially where it appears that whatever
interests the parties may have, may be, without prejudice, presented and
determined in an ordinary action to try the title. Brem v. Houck,
101-627.
Against sewer.—Where it appeared by the affidavit of two physicians
that a sewer used by the defendant was dangerous to the health of the
plaintiffs, it was not error to continue the injunction against its use to
the hearing. In such case, it is immaterial that the sewer is also used
by others. Evans v. Railroad, 96-45.
Against removal of fixtures. —If a mortgagor who is allowed to retain
possession, or if a vendee, under a bond for title is let into possession,
makes improvements and erects fixtures, he is not at liberty to remove
the same, because, bv his own default, he is not able to get the title, and
he may be enjoined in an action for foreclosure or specific performance.
Moore v. Valentine, 77-188.
Against erection of mills. —Where the rebuilding of a mill and dam
would injure the plaintiff's land and the health of his family, but the
mill would be a public convenience, an injunction against its erection
will not be granted. The plaintiff's remedy is compensation for dam
ages. Daughtry v. Warren, 85-136.
An injunction will not be granted to restrain the erection of a planingmill, and cotton-gin (in process of construction) upon an allegation that
they will, when completed, expose the plaintiff's premises to increased
perils of fire, and that the noise, etc., will render his dwelling unfit for
a residence. Dorsey v. Allen, 85-358.
See, for former practice as to injunctions against erecting mills, Battle's
Digest, vol. 3, p. 252, el seq.
Against stock-law fence. —Where it is in controversy whether the stocklaw extends to all the townships of the county, a restraining order should
not put a stop to the work on the fence altogether but only on such por
tions as would interfere with the rights of the townships claiming to be
exempt from the operations of the law. - McNair v. Commissioners
93-370.
Against interruption of works of public utility. —It is against the policy
of the law to enjoin the prosecution of such industries and enterprises
as tend to develop the resources of the country, except in those cases
where it is apparent that otherwise serious harm will result to the party
complaining. Roanoke Nav. Co. v. Emry, 108-130.
Where it appeared that the plaintiff corporation was engaged in the
erection of mills and an elevator of large capacity on laud claimed by
it, and to connect them with a railway station was constructing a rail
road running principally over its own land, when the defendants forci
bly entered on a part of said lands, claiming them as their own, and
obstructed the work, threatening plaintiff's servants with violence if
they persisted, and it further appeared that defendants' claim was doubt
ful : Held, to be a proper case for an injunction till hearing. Ibid.
Against collection of bonds, etc. —Where a sale and conveyance of land
had been made and bonds and mortgage executed to secure the pur
chase-money, and the purchaser brought an action for an alleged fraud
in the contract of sale, and asked for a cancellation of the papers, etc..
and moved for an injunction to restrain the defendant from collecting
or disposing of the bonds until the hearing ; and the evidence offered
in support of the motion tended to prove that the action was brought
in good faith : Held, that though the answer, admitted some of the
material allegations of the complaint, denied others, and alleged mat
ters in defence, and put in question the matter in litigation, still the
cause of action being serious, and there being a doubt, it was proper to
grant the injunction till the hearing. Caldwell v. Stirewalt, ioo-2o1.
Where the principal debtor borrowed a sum of money, which he depos
ited in a bank which soon afterwards became insolvent, and the surety
had to pay the debt, the surety has no equity to enjoin the principal
debtor from collecting the dividends from the insolvent bank, until he
can recover a judgment. Carlton v. Simonton, 94-401.
An injunction to the hearing is proper, when the complaint alleged,
and there was some evidence to prove, that the judgment for the balauce
of the purchase-money was collusive. Bost v. Lassiter, 105-490.
Against executor or administrator. —When it is alleged in the complaint,
that the defendant's testator occupied a fiduciary relation to the plain
tiffs, and invested their money in certain real estate, and that no settle
ment of accounts had been had between the plaintiffs and such fidu
ciary, the defendant should be restrained until the hearing from selling
such real estate for assets. McCorkle v. Brem, 76-407.
The extraordinary remedy by injunction will not be grauted, when it
appears that the petitioner has an adequate remedy by regular proceed
ings in the cause. In an action against an administrator de bonis non, to enjoin him from selling the land of the intestate for assets, it appearing
that a petition for that purpose was pending in the probate court, and that
the defendants therein denied the legality of the appointment of said
administrator be bonis non ; and it further appearing that no account had
been taken of the personal property of the intestate : It ivas held, that the
plaintiffs had an adequate remedy against the sale of said land in the
probate court, and that therefore it was not error in the court below to
dissolve the injunction theretofore granted. Johnson v. Jones, 75-206.
Lies against an insolvent administrator. Stenhouse v. Davis, 82-432.
Against sale or conveyance of land. —A complaint which alleges that the
defendant, being an executor, and having power to sell land under the
will, sold for Confederate money and is about to make title, but does
not allege fraud or collusion, is not sufficient ground for an injunction ,
to restrain him from conveying. Sprinkle v. Hutchison, 66-450.
When the affidavit alleges that the plaintiff has paid a trustee the
whole of the trust debt and that the trustee threatens to sell, and the
counter-affidavits admit that he has paid a part of the debt and that he
is entitled to a conveyance upon payment of the residue, the plaintiff
is entitled to an order to restrain the sale until the hearing. Dockery
v. French, 69-308.
An injunction does not lie to prevent a sale of land to prevent a cloud
being cast upon the title. Southerland v. Harper, 83-200 ; Cunningham
v. Bell, 83-238.
An injunction to restrain the sale of land conveyed in a Seed to secure
a debt will be granted where the parties dealing together have settled
their accounts and a note secured by the deed is given for the balance
found due, and fraud is alleged to have been practiced upon the mort
gagor or trustor in such settlement. The sale by the trustee will be
enjoined until the amount due is ascertained under the directions of the
court. Pritchard v. Sanderson, 84-299.
An injunction against the sale of land was properly granted on the
motion of the heirs of the deceased, where the land was advertised under
the power contained in an alleged will which was admitted to probate
without notice to the heirs and upon insufficient testimony and the
validity of the will is in controversy. Galbreath v. Everett, 84-546.
The purchaser of land sold under execution is not entitled to an injunc
tion to restrain a creditor from selling the property under an alleged
prior incumbrance. Fox v. Kline, 85-173.
An injunction lies to restrain, till the hearing, the sale of land, under
terms embraced in a contract of purchase, for such portion of the debt
as is alleged not to be, in fact, for the purchase-money, but incurred by
the necessitous circumstances of the vendee (or mortgagor) to obtain
further time from the veudor (or mortgagee). Tillery v. Wrenn, 86-217.
An injunction will not be granted restraining a trustee from selling
lands conveyed to him by a debtor to indemnify a surety, where it
appears that, in a former action having the same object, a consent decree
was made dismissing it, and wherein there was an agreement that the
trustee should sell if the debt was not paid by a day fixed, although the
terms of the deed might not have originally conferred a power of sale
without the intervention of the court. Brower v. Buxton, 100-419.
A court of equity will not interfere by injunction to restrain the sale
of land, or by the exercise of its jurisdiction to remove a cloud upon the
title, where it appears that the party seeking such relief is in possession,
and that the proofs upon which he relies will be available in any action
which may be instituted against him to recover the property. In such
case he has an adequate remedy at law. Where, however, the proofs
upon which such party must rely for a defence of his interest are of such
character that they may become lost by the lapse of time, and without
them one claiming under the adversary title could recover in an action
at law, the courts will interpose their equitable powers and grant the
necessary relief. Browning v. Lavender, 104-69.
Against collection of taxes. —An injunction lies at the instance of a tax
payer to enjoin the collection of an illegal tax by a municipal corpora
tion. London v. Wilmington, 78-109.
An injunction pendente lite, in an action to test the constitutionality
of an act authorizing the collection of taxes for past years, will not be
granted to restrain proceedings under the provisions of the act, except
to restrain the collection of the tax until the merits of the controversy
can be determined. Railroad v. Commissioners, 82-259.
The collection of proper revenues for the support of municipal corpo
rations will never be interfered with by injunction for mere irregularities,
particularly where the irregularities are the result of the negligence of
the tax-payer. Covington v. Rockingham, 93-134.
It is a settled rule of law that an injunction will not be granted to
restrain the collection of a tax, a portion of which is legal and a portion
illegal, until the applicant has paid that which is legal (if it can be sepa
rated and distingmshed from the illegal), and the complaint must point
out what part is valid and what invalid, so that the court may discrimi
nate between them. Ibid.
The collection of a tax will be restrained when the purpose for which
it is to be expended is unconstitutional. Rigsbee v. Durham, 94-801.
Note. —Since these decisions, the act of 1887 and other acts (see \ 334,
ante) have restricted the issuance of injunctions against the collection
of taxes).
The act of the general assembly (ch. 137, \ 84, Laws of 1887) forbidding
the granting of injunctions to restrain the collection of any tax, unless
such tax is levied for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, does not con
flict with either the Federal or State Constitutions. Railroad v. Lewis,
99-62; Mace v. Commissioners, 99-65; Matthews v. Commissioners, 99-69.
An injunction to restrain the collection of taxes which, it is alleged,
are levied for an unlawful or unauthorized purpose, will not be granted
nnless the facts are fully set forth from which the court can determine
the character or object for which they are levied. A general allegation
that the purpose was illegal or unauthorized, or that the assessment was
in excess of the constitutional limitations, is insufficient. The prohibi
tion against granting injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes, in
ch. 137, § 84, Laws 1887, embraces those cases where it is alleged the tax
is in excess of the constitutional limitations. Mace v. Commissioners,
99-65.
Against execution. —When the affidavit alleges that one of the defend
ants, who is the plaintiff's debtor, has conspired with the other, to give
him his bond without substantial consideration, and allow judgment
and execution thereon, in order to defraud the plaintiff, the injunction
will be continued to the hearing, although the defendants may deny the
fraud in their answer. Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612.
That the party failed to sustain his defence, in an action through the
unexpected absence of the nominal plaintiff, whom he had not subpoe
naed as a witness, is no ground for an injunction against the judgment
in such action. Wilder v. Lee, 64-50.
A separate action cannot be brought by the judgment debtor to
restrain an execution, on account of irregularity in the judgment or the execution. The proper remedy is a motion in the cause. Foard v. Alex
ander, 64-69 ; Burke v. Stokely, 65-569.
It is improper to make a sheriff a party to an action for injunction
against process which he has in his hands. Jarman v. Saunders, 64-367.
It is no ground for injunction against a judgment, obtained by the
assignee of a bankrupt bank, that the defendant, "being unable to
obtain the bills of the bank," had tendered in discharge of the judg
ment, one-half its amount in currency, which was alleged to be the value
of such bills. Smith v. Dewey, 64-463.
In an action by a debtor for injunction against a judgment creditor,
about to sell property under execution, upon which there are mort
gages, which the judgment creditor claims to be fraudulent, the mort
gagees should be made parties to the action, in order that the rights of
all concerned may be determined in one action. Gaster v. Hardie,
75-460.
The remedy of a defendant aggrieved by a judgment is not by injunc
tion, but by an application to the court, wherein the judgment was ren
dered, for relief. Chambers v. Penland, 78-53. ■
One in quiet possession of land, as owner, may obtain au injunction
to restrain others from dispossessing him, by means of process obtained
in a litigation to which he was not a party. Banks v. Parker, 80-157.
An injunction will not lie against execution on a judgment, which
might have been set aside by motion in due time under \ 133, C. C. P.,
(J 274, post). Walker v. Gurley, 83-429.
An injunction to restrain a plaintiff from executing his judgment
against the defendant will not be granted. If there is error in the judg
ment, the remedy is by a motion to modify the judgment and an order
suspending proceedings. Parker v. Bledsoe, 87-221.
Where a judgment debtor applies for an injunction to restrain the
sheriff from selling a contingent interest in land which was not liable to
be sold under execution, the injunction should be refused. Bristol v.
Hallyburton, 93-384.
A court of equity will not interfere by injunction to stay an execution
regularly issued upon a judgment at law, because the sheriff has levied
on property not the subject of sale under execution, or because the
property belongs to another than the judgment debtor, except where
the property levied on is personal property, and the sheriff and plain
tiff are both insolvent. Bristol v. Hallyburton, 93-384 ; Gatewood v.
Burns, 99-357.
Where a feme covert was sued with her husband, whom she instructed
to make a proper defence to the action, which he failed to do : // teas
held, no ground for an injunction to restrain the collection of the judg
ment, in the absence of fraud. Neville v. Pope, 95-346.
Where it is alleged by one seeking an injunction against execution in
which he represented that he was only surety (but that fact did not
appear in the judgment), that a contest was pending between the judg
ment creditors and the principal debtor as to the allotment of the latter's homestead: Held, that this was not sufficient to authorize the court
to grant an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the execution
against the surety. Gatewood v. Leak, 99-357.
Under the present practice, 'a writ of possession may be stayed or
enjoined, upon a proper application, by one rightfully in possession,
although not a party to the action in which the writ is issued. Springs
v. Schenck, 99-551.
Where in claim and delivery before a justice of the peace the action
was dismissed, and an order of restitution made, and an alternative judg
ment for the value of the property if not returned, a restraining order
will not be granted against the execution issued on such judgment.
Powell v. Allen, 103-46!
In cases of fraud. —While a creditor can issue execution and sell prop
erty disposed of in fraud of creditors, this does not prevent a court of
equity from restraining the fraudulent donee until the question of fraud
can be tried, so that the property can be sold free from any cloud, and
under The Code practice, all this may be done in one action. Frank v.
Robinson, 96-28.
Where there is cause for complaint by stockholders against others,
they should first resort to the remedy prescribed in their charter ; and
failing in this, they will have a right to proceed against the delinquents,
and, in proper cases, injunction will be granted to protect the rights of
parties. A good cause of complaint in such cases is fraud or serious
injury done, or about to be done, by some of the stockholders or officers,
for which there is no adequate remedy given under the charter. Moore
v. Mining Co., 104-534.
Against exercise of official functions. —The judge below erred in granting
an injunction, by which the persons in possession of the offices of mayor
and aldermen of a city, and actually performing the duties of those
offices, are restrained from all official acts. Campbell v. Wolfenden,
74-103It is not sufficient to allege that the persons filling the offices were not
regularly or rightfully elected ; but it must also appear that they are
abusing or about to abuse their possession of official power to the public
injury ; and that the public will sustain no damage by the suspension,
for an indefinite time, of all city government. Ibid.
An injunction will not be granted to restrain or supervise the exercise
of the discretion conferred by law upon public officers in the discharge
of their duties. Burwell v. Com'rs, 93-73.
The court will not interfere by injunction to arrest the action of public
officers in the performance of a public duty, such as the construction of
a county fence, unless it clearly appears that it is in violation of the
Constitution or without legal warrant. Busbee v. Com'rs, 93-143.
Against a town ordinance.—The remedy, for an injury resulting from
the operation of an unlawful town ordinance, is not by injunction. The
party injured has a complete redress in an action for damages. Cohen
v. Com'rs, 77-2.
Cannot test validity of a statute. —An injunction does not lie as a mode of
testing the validity of an act of assembly. In proper proceedings to test
directly the constitutionality of the act, an injunction will sometimes
issue as an ancillary proceeding. Smallwood v. Newbern, 90-36.
Cannot try title to office.—This section does not apply to a case where a
plaintiff brings an action in his own name, alleging that he is the taxcollector of a county, and that the defendant has usurped the office, and
asking that he be restrained from exercising its functions. It is confined
to cases in which some private right is the subject of controversy, and
not the title to a public office. Patterson v. Hubbs, 65-119.
Cannot try title to personal property. —The title to personal property can
not be tried by injunction : therefore, when a sheriff levied upon certain
personal property, which had been allotted to the defendant in the exe
cution as his personal property exemption, and remained in his posses
sion, and was restrained by injunction from selling the same, it was
error. Baxter v. Baxter, 77-1 i8.
Upon dissolution of a corporation. —When a corporation has dissolved, and
there is a contest as to whether the party seeking to collect its assets is
an officer of the same or not, an injunction lies till the hearing. Dobson
v. Simon ton, 78-63.
In an action brought for the dissolution of a corporation under acts
1875, ch. 198, the court after publication of the summons has full control
of the franchise and property of the company, and an injunction will
issue to prevent their being sold under an execution in favor of a cred
itor. Attorney General v. Roanoke Navigation Co., 84-705.
Pending an appeal. —To stay proceedings, pending the review of a decis
ion of the clerk, in regard to the sufficiency or insufficiency of an under
taking for an appeal, a supersedeas is the proper remedy, and not an
injunction. Salisbury v. Cohen, 68-289.
When an appeal has been perfected by the filing of the required under
takings, all further proceedings under the execution are suspended, by
the clerk giving notice to the sheriff of that fact. It does not constitute
a case for injunction, in an action against the sheriff and the plaintiff.
Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
When a person, whose land has been taken by the commissioners of
a town for public use, appeals from the assessment of damages made b}those appointed to value it, he waives all irregularity in the proceedings
to condemn the same, and takes up, by his appeal, only the question of
damages ; so that he is not entitled to an injunction to prevent its use
by the corporation. Johnson v. Rankin, 70-550.
(2) and (j) depend upon extrinsic facts.
(2) When, during the litigation, it shall appear by affida
vit of plaintiff, or any other person, that the defendant is
doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or procuring or suf
fering some act to be done in violation of the plaintiff's
rights respecting the subject of the action and tending to
render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary injunction
may be granted to restrain him therefrom;
Insolvency. —An allegation of insolvency is essential to the granting of
an injunction, except in special cases in which irreparable injury would
be sustained, though the defendant is solvent. Dunkart v. Rinel'art,
87-224; Dunkart v. Henry, 87-228; McCormick v. Nixon, 83-113; Jones
v. Hill, 64-198.
Where the lessee sues the lessor in claim and delivery for his part of
the crop, and the lessor is solvent, an injunction will not be granted to
restrain such lessor from selling the crop. Wilson v. Respass, 86-112.
The order for an injunction and receiver, upon the finding that the
trustee was insolvent and had misapplied the rents and profits, was
properly granted. Albright v. Albright, 91-220.
Irreparable injury. —Where a defendant gave a railroad company license
in writing to cross his lands if they would open a street upon his prem
ises in consideration of being allowed to do so, and the company ran
across his lands and did not open the street, and were notified by him
that he would re-possess the laud occupied by the track if they did not
open the street in fifteen days: Held to be a threat of irreparable injury,
which entitles the company to an injunction until the final hearing.
Railroad v. Battle, 66-540.
An injunction will be granted until the hearing, where the plaintiff
alleges irreparable injury and makes out au apparent case. Marshall v.
Commissioners, 89-103.
It is not sufficient for the plaintiff to allege in general terms that the
injury will be irreparable, but he must set out such facts as will enable
the court to see what the injury is, and the probability that it will hap
pen. Frink v. Stewart, 94-484.
Where injury is conjectural. —The use of water by an upper proprietor
will not be restrained in favor of a lower proprietor while the damage is
as yet conjectural merely and denied by the defendant, and when the
injury, if anv, can be adequately compensated by damages. Walton v.
Mills, 86-280'.
Where the evidence is conflicting. —An injunction will be continued to
the hearing to retain control of a trust fund in dispute, where there is a
reasonable probability that the plaintiff is entitled to relief and the; evi
dence is conflicting. Morris v. Willard, 84-293.
The courts will not dissolve injunctions till the hearing, where it is
apparent from the pleadings and proofs and there is serious dispute
about the facts and doubts as to the relief sought. Durham v. Railroad,
104-261.
Against erroneous judgment. —Where the court has jurisdiction, errors
in the judgment cannot be corrected by an injunction, but only by
appeal, except where fraud is alleged. Neville v. Pope, 95-346.
Against cutting timber. —Does not lie to restrain from cutting timber,
unless the defendant is insolvent. McCormick v. Nixon, 83-113. See
i 625, post.
An injunction will not be granted to prevent the cutting of trees for
timber, unless from the insolvency of the alleged trespasser compensa
tion in money cannot be had. Dunkart v. Rinehart, 87-224.
It is not now necessary, in an application for an injunction to enjoin
a trespass on land, to allege the insolvency of the defendant, when the
trespass is continuous in its nature, or is the cutting and destruction of
timber trees. (Ch. 401, Laws 1885.) Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93-22.
Where, in an action to recover land, the plaintiff applied for and
obtained an injunction against the cutting and removing timber by the
defendant, and the latter, in his answer, denied the plaintiff's title,
averred title in himself, and alleged that the plaintiff was cutting and
carrying away timber which was of peculiar value for manufacturing
purposes: It was held, that while the courts should be reluctant to inter
fere with bona fide industries and enterprises by injunction, they would
require the plaintiffs to give bonds to answer the defendants in possible
damages, and would also appoiut a receiver, who should take and state
accurate accounts of the timber cut and removed by the plaintiffs, until
the cause should be heard on its merits, notwithstanding the plaintiffs
are solvent. Ibid.
While the act of 1885 (ch. 401) dispenses with the necessity for an
allegation of insolvency of the person against whom an injunction is
sought to restrain a trespass continuous in its nature, or the cutting of
timber trees, it does not limit the discretion of the court to make such
orders as may be necessary to protect the rights of the parties pending
the litigation; and where the trespass is admitted or proved, the court
should require the defendants to execute a bond to secure the plaintiffs
against any damages they may recover upou the final determination of
the action, and, upon failure to do so, appoint a receiver or make such other order as may be necessary to secure the rights of the parties.
Ousby v. Neal, 99-146.
A judgment is now a lien upon land to which the debtor is entitled as
a homestead, and when the land is not worth more than $1,000, and
much of its value consists in timber trees, the debtor or other person to
whom he has sold them, may be enjoined from cutting such trees for
profit. Jones v. Britton, 102-166.
Against sale under mortgage.—When a vendee of land secures the pur
chase-money by mortgage, makes valuable improvements, and after
default obtains an injunction to restrain a sale, the defendants (the
vendors) have a right to have a receiver appointed. Howes v. Mauney,
66-218.
A party who purchases land must, in general, look to his vendor alone
for a title ; and in the absence of a warranty and of fraud, the doctrine
of caveat emptor applies between the vendor and the vendee. Where A,
a corporation, purchased from B, land sold under a mortgage, and on
the same day mortgaged the land to C, the fact that D claimed title to
the land, and had brought an action to assert that title, is not sufficient
ground for an injunction against C, restraining the sale of the land under
his mortgage, although A, at the time of purchasing the land, was
ignorant of the claim. Gold Amalgamating Co. v. Ore Dressing Co.,
73-468.
The plaintiff instituted an action against the defendants for an account,
whereupon the defendants, under powers contained in certain mort
gages executed to them by the plaintiff, advertised his land for sale; there
had been numerous dealings between the parties for many years, and
the status of the account was in dispute : Held, that the defendants
should be restrained from selling under the mortgages, until the action
for account is tried and the balance due ascertained by judgment. Capehart v. Biggs, 77-261.
Where there have been mutual dealings between the parties, several
mortgages given and the balance due from the mortgagor is in dispute,
a sale advertised under the power given in the mortgage should be
enjoined until the balance is ascertained and declared by a decree of court.
Purnell v. Vaughan, 77-268 ; Bridgers v. Morris, 90-32.
An injunction against carrying out a contract of sale, made under a
power contained in a mortgage, will not be granted where the relief
which the plaintiff claims is not sought until after the sale is made and
the rights of purchasers have intervened. The plaintiff should have
attended at the sale and given notice of his claims. Pender v. Pitman,
S4-372An injunction to restrain a sale under a mortgage given to secure a
usurious debt will be refused if the mortgagee waive the usurious part
of the contract. Manning v. Elliott, 92-48.
Where it appears in an application to enjoin a mortgagee from selling
the mortgaged property under the power of sale, that there are many
and complicated accounts between the mortgagor and mortgagee, and
the balance due is uncertain, the court will restrain the execution of the
power of sale until an account can be stated and the amount due ascer
tained. In such case, the rule which requires a mortgagee, in certain
cases, to pay the amount admitted to be due before the injunction will
be granted, does not apply, because no definite sum is known to be due.
Harrison v. Bray, 92-488 ; Gooch v. Vaughan, 92-610.
A mortgagee will not be restrained because he failed to give mort
gagor ninety days' notice of his intention to foreclose. Such notice is
unnecessary. Bridgers v. Morris, 90-32 ; Manning v. Elliott, 92-48 ;
Carver v. Brady, 104-219.
Before one can ask the court, by injunction, to restrain a sale under
mortgage, on account of usurious interest charged, he must pay what
is justly due, principal and interest. He who would have equity must
do equity. Cook v. Patterson, 103-127; Carver v. Brady, 104-219.
Against receiving fees of office. —An injunction does not lie to prevent
the incumbent of an office receiving the fees thereof pending litigation
in regard to his right to the office. Patterson v. Hubbs, 65-119. See \ 610.
Against working a mine. —Will not be granted to stop the working of a
gold mine, but if defendant is insolvent a receiver will be appointed.
Parker v. Parker, 82-165.
Against working turpentine trees. —An injunction, restraining defend
ants from working turpentine trees, when the answer meets every mate
rial allegation of the complaint, and the mischief complained of is not
irreparable, (no other affidavits being filed by the plaintiff) will be dis
solved upon the hearing of the complaint and answer. Bell v. Chadwick, 71-329Bents and profits. —When a mortgagor remains in possession after the
date of forfeiture, and is alleged to be insolvent and disposing of the
crop raised on the premises, in an action to recover rental for the time
elapsing after forfeiture, the mortgagee is ertitled to an injunction to
restrain such sale pending the action. Jones v. Hill, 64-198.
Pending an action for the recovery of land, an injunction does not lie,
restraining the defendant from enjoying the fruits of his possession and
claim of title; and especially where it does not appear that the plain
tiff will lose the fruits of his recovery if he establishes his title. Bald
win v. York, 71-463.
Where a plaintiff sues in forma pauperis to recover land, and during
the pendency of the suit takes possession of a part thereof and resists
the re-occupation by defendant, an order for an injunction and a receiver
to take control of the usurped premises and secure the rents and
profits, upon the defendant's application, is properly granted. Hortou
v. White, 84-297.
(3) And where, during the pendency of an action, it
shall appear by affidavit of plaintiff or any other person,
that the defendant threatens, or is about to remove or dis
pose of his property, with intent to defraud the plaintiff, a
temporary injunction may be granted to restrain such
removal or disposition.
Against removal or distribution of fond. —An injunction will be continued
to the hearing to retain control of a trust fund, when the rights of the
parties are doubtful, and the defendant threatens to remove the fund
beyond the jurisdiction of the court. In such case the court may allow
the defendant to dispose of the property, upon his giving bond to pro
tect the other claimants. Frank v. Robinson, 96-28.
The trustee should be restrained from paying any part of the proceeds of
sale coming into his hands until the controversy is determined. Rob
erts v. Lewald, 107-305.
Sec. 339. At what time granted ; a copy of affidavit to be
served. C. C. P., 8. 100.
The injunction may be granted at the time of commencing the action, or at any time afterwards, before judgment ;
upon its appearing satisfactorily to the judge, by the affi
davit of the plaintiff, or of any other person, that sufficient
grounds exist therefor. A copy of the affidavit must be
served with the injunction.
Cannot issue before summons. —An injunction granted before the issuing
of the summons in the action is premature and irregular. Patrick v.
Joyner, 63-573; Trexler v. Newsom, 88-13; Grant v. Edwards, 90-31.
See cases cited, $ 341, post.
Summons need not be served. —The issuing of the summons is the com
mencement of the action, and it is not necessary that it shall be served
before the injunction or restraining order is made. Fleming v. Patter
son, 99-404.
One who willfully disobeys an injunction or restraining order, is guilty
of contempt, though the summons in the action may not have been
served upon him. Ibid.
Waiver of irregularity.—An injunction order can only be granted at
the time of the issue of the summons or afterwards. If it be granted
before, or if it direct the issue of a summons, it is irregular, and will be
dissolved on motion. But if the defendant answer the complaint, and
objection be not taken till the trial, the irregularity is deemed to have
been waived, and the court will not notice it, sua sponte. Heilig v.
Stokes, 63-612 ; McArthur v. McEachin, 64-72 ; Hirsh v. Whitehead,
65-516.
Affidavit. —In an application for injunction, an affidavit by one not a
party to the action, that what he has stated in the complaint is true, can
not be considered, he having stated nothing in the complaint. Martin
v. Sloan, 69-128.
Verification of affidavit. —The affidavit for a provisional remedy is suffi
ciently verified, when made before a commissioner of this state, resi
dent in another state, and authenticated by his official seal and signa
ture. Young v. Rollins, 85-485.
Sec. 340. Injunction after answer allowed upon notice.
C. C. P., s. 191.
An injunction should not be allowed after the defendant
shall have answered, unless upon notice, or upon an order
to show cause ; but in such case the defendant may be
restrained until the decision of the judge granting or refus
ing the injunction.
Notice essential. —An order to restrain proceedings for more than twenty
days, made by a judge at chambers, without notice to the adverse party,
will be set aside on motion. Foard v. Alexander, 64-69.
See 594 and 595, post, and cases there cited.
It is error to grant an injunction staying execution on a judgment,
without (1) notice to the plaintiff, and (2) an undertaking for at least a
sum equal to the judgment. Faison v. Mcllwaine, 72-312.
Actual notice.—When the injunction is granted in term, a party to the
action is fixed with notice. Hemphill v. Moore, 104-379.
Sec. 341. Undertaking upon injunction; damages, how
ascertained, C. C. P., 8. 192.
Upon granting a restraining order or an order for an
injunction, the judge shall require as a condition precedent
to the issuing thereof, that the clerk shall take from the
plaintiff a written undertaking, with sufficient sureties to be
justified before, and approved by, the said clerk, or by the
judge, in an amount to be fixed by the judge, to the effect
that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined such dam
ages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, as he may
sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court shall
finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto.
The damages may be ascertained by a reference or other
wise, as the judge shall direct, and the decision of the court
thereupon shall be conclusive as to the amount of damages,
upon all the persons who have an interest in the under
taking.
No undertaking filed.—Semble, that an injunction granted without
requiring an undertaking, is irregular, but not void. Sledge v. Blum,
63-374It is error to grant an injunction without requiring the plaintiff to give
the undertaking required by this section, and such order must be vaca
ted on motion. Sledge v. Blum, 63-374; Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516;
Faison v. Mcllwaine, 72-312 ; Miller v. .Parker, 73-58.
Undertaking filed but no summons issued. —If an injunction bond has been
filed without the issue of summons, judgment for costs and damages
may still be rendered against the principal and sureties thereto. McArthur v. McEachin, 64-72.
Deposit in lieu of undertaking. —Where an injunction order requires the
plaintiff to give an undertaking with sufficient sureties, it seems that a
deposit in money of the sum named will suffice ; at least, the giving of
the undertaking before a motion to vacate, after having made such a
deposit, will prevent the order being vacated on that account. Richards
v. Baurman, 65-162.
Undertaking must specify amount. —The injunction bond is not void though
no amount is named therein. Gold Co. v. Ore Co., 79-48.
Amount fixed by the judge. —The amount of the undertaking to be given
upon the granting of an injunction or restraining order must be fixed by
the judge, and while it may be executed and the sureties allowed to
justify before the clerk, the latter, in that respect, is the mere servant
of the judge, who may revise his action, and from the latter no appeal
lies. Bynum v. Com'rs, 101-412.
Judge can pass upon sufficiency of sureties. —The judge has the right to
take the bond and to determine the sufficiency of the sureties. The
judge is not concluded by the action of the clerk in passing upon their
sufficiency. A motion to the judge to approve the bond requires no
notice to the other side. Sternberger v. Hawley, 85-141.
Damages against the plaintiff and bond, —Fees paid to counsel, beyond the
sums allowed to be recovered by the party prevailing in the action, under
Title XII of The Code (not then repealed), are not a part of the damages
sustained by reason of the injunction. Hyman v. Deverenx, 65-588.
In ascertaining the damages sustained by reason of an injunction stay
ing proceedings, reference must be had to its effect on the debt, the col
lection of which was enjoined. If the defendant has become insolvent
during its continuance, the whole debt should be included ; if his condi
tion is unchanged, only the costs and disbursements in the proceeding
for injunction. McKesson v. Hennessee, 66-473.
A separate action cannot be brought upon an injunction bond for dam
ages ; nor is it a proper injunction bond if it specifies no amount. Gold
Co. v. Ore Co., 79-48.
Qucpre, whether a jury trial is a matter of right upon the question of
such damages. Ibid.
To entitle the defendant to recover damages, he must show want of
probable cause, or malice, in the plaintiff. Burnett v. Nicholson, 79543.
It seems the damages are recoverable on a restraining order as upon
an injunction, and whether a bond is given or not. Ibid.
Sec. 342. Order to show cause; restraint in the meantime.
C. C -P., s. 193.
If the judge deem it proper that the defendant, or any of
several defendants, should be heard before granting the
injunction, an order may be made requiring cause to be
shown, at a specified time and place, why the injunction
should not be granted ; and defendant may, in the mean
time, be restrained.
Notice. —An injunction to restrain collection should never be allowed
except on notice to the adverse party, and then only on the party apply
ing giving bond in a sum at least equal to the judgment sought to be
restrained. Faison v. Mcllwaine, 72-312 ; Foard v. Alexander, 64-69.
Sec. 343. 1njunction to suspend business of corporation not
granted, unless undertaking is given. C. C. P., s. 194.
An injunction to suspend the general and ordinary busi
ness of a corporation shall not be granted without due notice
of the application therefor, to the proper officers of the
corporation, except where the state is a party to the proceeding, unless the plaintiff shall give a written undertak
ing, executed by two sufficient sureties, to be approved by
the judge, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay all dam
ages, not exceeding the sum to be mentioned in the under
taking, which such corporation may sustain by reason of
the injunction, if the court shall finally decide that the
plaintiff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be
ascertained by a reference, or otherwise, as the court shall
direct.
■Sec. 344. Injunction without notice, vacated or modified
upon notice. C. C. P., s. 191*.
If the injunction be granted without notice, the defend
ant, at any time before the trial, may apply, upon ten days'
notice to the judge having jurisdiction thereof, to vacate or
modify the same. The application may be made upon the
complaint and the affidavits on which the injunction was
granted, or upon the affidavits on the part of the defend
ant, with or without answer ; but if no such application be
made, the injunction shall continue, and be in force until
such application shall be made and determined by the judge,
and a verified answer has the effect only of an affidavit.
What judge has jurisdiction to vacate. —A judge has no power to vacate
injunctions except in his own district; hut a judge who exchanges dis
tricts with another, for a whole circuit or for a series of courts, becomes
the judge of that district during the continuance of such courts. Bear
v. Cohen, 65-511 ; Morris v. Whitehead, 65-637.
The practice under this section previous to the act of i876-'77, was,
in effect, that any judge of a superior court might issue an injunction
order or order of restraint, but only the judge of the district in which
the county was located, where the action was triable, c^uld hear a
motion to modify or vacate such order. Mauney v. Commissioners,
71-4S6.
The judge of an adjoining district can now, in certain circumstances,
hear an application upon a restraining order, (under acts 1881, ch. 51).
Galbreath v. Everett, 84-546. See \ 336, ante.
Modification without notice. —A judge may modify an injunction, upon
application of the defendant, without notice, if he found his action
solely upon the affidavits of the plaintiffs. He cannot in such case hear
any affidavits or consider the answer of the defendants. Sledge v. Blum,
Injunction will be dissolved, when. —Where the defendant on the filing of
his answer fully, completely and directly denies the facts on which any
equity in plaintiff 's favor arose, it is his right to have the injunction
dissolved, in all cases of common injunctions. Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612;
Capehart v. Mhoon, 45-30; Faison v. Mcllwain, 72-312 ; Perry v. Michaux, 79-94 ; Walker v. Gurley, 83-429 ; Perkins v. Howell. 40-24 ;
Sharpe v. King, 38-402 ; Riggsbee v. Durham, 98-81.
Where q restraining order has been obtained and continued until the
term when the defendants were summoned to answer, and upon their
answer being filed the judge refuses to grant the injunction, on consid
eration of the complaint and answer : This is not error, where the
answer denies all the allegations of the complaint. Woodfin v. Beach,
7°-455.
. ,
The plaintiffs, tax-payers in a township, obtained an order, restrain
ing the defendants from collecting certain taxes to pay the accumulated
debt of the township, and to defray the current expenses thereof, alleg
ing in their complaint that the debt was fraudulent, had never been
legally audited, and had been ordered by the defendants to be paid as a
whole, "or in a batch," and not each claim separately. The answer of
the defendants denies each and every material allegation in the com
plaint, and no other affidavits were filed : Held, that his Honor, who
heard the case after the answer was filed, did not err in vacating the
temporary restraining order and suffering the defendants to collect the
tax already levied. Mitchell v. Commissioners, 74-487.
Injunction will not be dissolved, when.—Upon a motion to dissolve an
injunction, where a fund has been taken in custody of the law, the rule
is, that as the court has hold of it, it will not let it go, if the plaintiff
show probable cause, from which it may be reasonably inferred that he
will be able to make out his case on the final hearing. On the contrary,
if it appear from the pleadings and affidavits that there is not probable
cause, the injunction will be dissolved. Craycoff v. Morehead, 67-422.
Where the injunctive relief sought is not auxiliary to another and
main relief, but is the main relief itself and the object of the action, the
dissolution of the injunction would be equivalent to a dismissal of the
action, .and in such case the court will not dissolve the injunction where
a reasonable doubt exists whether the equity of the complaint is suffi
ciently negatived by the answer. Lowe v. Commissioners, 70-532 ;
Marshall v. Commissioners, 89-103.
In an application for a special injunction, when the property is in
custodia legis, the court will not let go the property and allow the same
to be sold, if there is a probability that the merits are with the plaintiff,
notwithstanding the defendant's answer denies the allegation upon
which such application is founded. Where the material facts of the
plaintiff's complaint are not denied, the injunction will most certainly
be continued to the hearing. Ponton v. McAdoo, 71-101.
Where, in an action to obtain a perpetual injunction, the plaintiff
appears to be acting in good faith, and sets out a prima facie case, and
the defendant confesses and avoids the allegations of the complaint,
and answers only on information and belief, the injunction should be
continued to the hearing. Turner v. Cuthrell, 94-239.
In common injunctions, where proceedings at law are arrested by the
injunction, the rule is to dissolve it, when the allegations in the com
plaint are fully and fairly denied by the answer; but special injunc
tions, which are in aid of a suit pending and whose object is to secure to
the plaintiff the benefit of the action, will not be dissolved, when it
appears to the court by affidavits or otherwise, that there is probable
ground for the primary equity, and a reasonable apprehension of irrep
arable loss. Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, 94-425.
Where the complaint states facts sufficient to authorise a temporary
injunction, and the answer raises serious issues, the determination of
which is doubtful, it is not error to continue the injunction till the
hearing upon the merits, especially when it appears that the subject
matter of the action will remain unimpaired. Whitaker v. Hill, 96-2.
Appeal. —Quaere, if an appeal lies from an order vacating, refusing or
granting an injunction. French v. Wilmington, 75-387.
Op the hearing of an appeal from an order granting or refusing an
injunction, the supreme court will review the findings of fact of the
judge below. Jones v. Boyd, 80-258.
A decree or order granting or dissolving an injunction, is not vacated
by an appeal. Green v. Griffin, 95-50
On appeal the court will review findings of facts on an application to
continue an injunction to the hearing. Evans v. Railroad, 96-47.
Sec. 345. Application to modify or vacate upon affidavit
may be opposed by affidavit. C. C. P., s. 1.96'.
If the application be made upon affidavits on the part of
the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose
the same by affidavits or other proof, in addition to those
on which the injunction was granted.
Answer treated as an affidavit. —The answer under the present practice,
in an application to vacate an injunction, is itself but an affidavit when
verified and the plaintiff may introduce other affidavits to support the
allegations in his complaint. The answer is not, as it was formerly
when responsive to the bill, and fair and frank in its statements, con
clusive on the subject of the dissolution of an injunction, but only has
the effect of an affidavit. Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, 94-425.
Additional affidavits by plaintiff. —When a defendant, upon a motion to
vacate, usesliis answer as an affidavit, the plaintiff may file counter-affi
davit. Howerton v. Sprague, 64-451.
When the defendant meets the plaintiff's allegations bv counter-affi
davits, it is competent for the plaintiff to support his original affidavits
by others and in reply to those offered by the defendant. Young v.
Rollins, 85-485.
Note. —The additional affidavits will be allowed in the case of attach
ment proceedings, to cure the defects in the original affidavit. Clark v.
Clark, 64-150.
Sec. 346. Restraining order shall not be granted for more
than twenty days without notice; but continue until dis
solved on notice. C. C. P., s. 345.
No restraining order, or order to stay proceedings for a
longer time than twenty days, shall be granted by a judge
out of court, except upon due notice to the adverse party ;
but the said order shall continue and remain in force until
vacated upon notice.
Dismissed if continuance not moved for. —If a party, who has obtained a
temporary restraining order, does not appear and ask for its continu
ance at the time fixed for the hearing, the application may be dismissed
without going into the merits. Coward v. Chastain, 99-443.
Cannot be granted for more than twenty days. —An order to stay proceed
ings for a longer time than twenty days, made by a judge at chambers
and without notice to the adverse party, will be set aside on motion.
Foard v. Alexander, 64-69.
Note. —For the practice as to injunctions and receivers, obtaining prior
to the C. C. P., see Battle's Digest, vol. 3, pp. 252-284.
Sec. 347. In what action* attachment may be issued. C.
C. P., s. 197.
A warrant of attachment against the property of one or
more defendants in an action, may be granted upon the
application of the plaintiff, as specified in this chapter,
when the action is to recover a sum of money only, or dam
ages for one or more of the following causes :
(1) Breach of contract, express or implied ;
(2) Wrongful conversion of personal property ;
(3) Any other injury to personal property, in consequence
of negligence, fraud, or other wrongful act.
No summons,—If no summons issued in the action, the warrant of
attachment is not only irregular, but void. Marsh v. Williams, 63-371.
Summons returnable. —Notwithstanding the provisions of its eleventh
section, the act of i86S-'9, ch. 76, is to be construed as requiring the
summons in cases where the defendant is a non-resident to be returned
to the term of the court, though that section requires the warrant of
attachment to be returned before the clerk. Backalan v. Littlefield,
64-233.
Where a summons was made returnable, and the complaint and answer
in chief were filed before the clerk (July, 1869), and he returned the case
to the next term, the docket of which showed the names of the respective
counsel marked to such case: Held, that at spring term, 1870, it was
competent for the judge to amend the summons by making it returnable
to the term, in accordance with the act of 1868-9, ch. 76. Thomas v.
Womack, 64-657.
The ninth section of the act of iS6S-'9 (repealed by ch. 28 of the acts
of i869-'7o) was unconstitutional. Latham v. Whitehurst, 69-33.
Ancillary remedy. —Under the C. C. P., an attachment is not the founda
tion of an independent action, but an ancillary remedy collateral to the
action. Toms v. Warson, 66-417; Marsh v. Williams, 63-371.
Does not lie, for what causes. —An attachment does not lie for unliqui
dated damages. Price v. Cox, 83-261; Wilson v. Mfg. Co., 88-5.
Does not lie for a breach of promise of marriage. Price v. Cox, 83-261.
In an action for unliquidated damages, no attachment can issue, and
constructive service by publication in such action is not sufficient for any
purpose. Winfree v. Bagley, 102-515.
Statute substantially complied with. —If it appears from the whole record
that the statute has been substantially complied with, the action will not
be dismissed. Grant v. Burgwyn, 79-513.
Effect of bankruptcy of defendant. —Where the defendant went into bank
ruptcy subsequent to the attachment, but, before final judgment, the
attachment was properly dissolved. Whitman v. Guano Co., 65-552.
Personal property exemption. —The personal property exemption of a
resident of the state cannot be sold under process of attachment. Com
missioners v. Riley, 75-144.
In rem or in personam, quaere. —Quare, whether an attachment, prose
cuted on notice by publication of the seizure of the debtor's property to
final judgment, is a proceeding in rem or in personam, under the present
law. Penniman v. Daniel, 91-431.
Eight to intervene. —Attachment is not the foundation of an independ
ent action, but is a proceeding in an action already commenced. Hence,
a stranger to the action in which the attachment issues has no right to
intervene and make himself a party to the attachment merely, though,
upon proof of interest in the property attached, he may be allowed to
make up a collateral issue of title. Toms v. Warson, 66-417. See \ 375,
post, and cases there cited.
Sec. 348. Warrant to accompany summons, or to be ixsued
afterwards. C. C. P , s. 1U7.
The warrant of attachment may be granted to accom
pany the summons, or at any time after the commencement
of the action. Personal service of the summons must be
made upon the defendant against whose property the attach
ment is granted within thirty days after the granting thereof,
or else, upon the expiration of the same time, service of
summons by publication must be commenced pursuant to
an order obtained therefor, and if publication has been or
is thereafter commenced, the service must be made com
plete by the continuance thereof.
Irregularity of warrant. —A warrant of attachment which does not state
when or where it is returnable is irregular. Backalan v. Littlefield,
64-233The warrant of attachment is an auxiliary remedy to secure the satis
faction of any judgment which may be obtained in the action, and is not
only irregular, but void, when (1) there is no summons to sustain the
auxiliary remedy; (2) it does not appear that the defendant is trying to
evade the service of process; and (3) the affidavit does not show that the
debtor has removed, or is about to remove, assign, etc., his property
with intent to defraud his creditors. Marsh v. Williams, 63-371.
The act suspending The Code (i868-'9, ch. 76) does not modify the
provisions of The Code in regard to the return of a warrant of attach
ment. Backalan v. Littlefield, 64-233.
Defective service by publication. —A defective service by publication may
be rightfully remedied by an order for re-publication. Price v. Cox,
83-261.
A further order of publication may be made upon a corrected affidavit
without discharging the attachment. Branch v. Frank, 81-180; Price v.
Cox, 83-26,1; Penniman v. Daniel, 90-154.
Amendment of order of publication. —Where notice of the attachment is
omitted from the order of publication, but in the published notice the
defendant is informed that an attachment has been issued against his
property, to what court it is returnable, etc., the court has power to amend the order of publication so as to insert a requirement that notice
be given of the attachment. Bank v. Blossom, 92-695.
Quare, whether such amendment is necessary. Ibid.
A general appearance cures all irregularity. —If, after publication and issue
of attachment, the defendant enters a general appearance, it cures all
antecedent irregularity in the process. Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21.
Procedure before the clerk. —Orderly method of procedure before the clerk
in attachment proceedings, and appeals therein, discussed by Merritnon,
C. J. Cushing v. Styron, 104-338.
Sec. 340. What must be shown to procure the warrant. V.
C. P., 8. 201.
To entitle the plaintiff to such a warrant, lie must show
by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court granting the
same, as follows :
(1) That one of the causes of action specified in section
three hundred and forty-seven exists against the defendant.
If the action is to recover damages for breach of contract,
the defendant must show that the plaintiff is entitled to
recover a sum stated therein, over and above all counter
claims known to him ;
(2) That the defendant is either a foreign corporation, or
not a resident of the state ; or, if he is a natural person,
and a resident of the state, that he has departed therefrom,
with intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid service
of summons, or keeps himself concealed therein with like
intent ; or, if the defendant is a natural person, or a domes
tic corporation, that he or it has removed, or is about to
remove, property from the state, with intent to defraud his
or its creditors; or has assigned, disposed of, or secreted, or
is about to assign, dispose of, or secrete property, with the
like intent.
A warrant will issue, when.—A warrant may be had, in the cases where
it is provided, if the amount of the demand is certain, or capable of
being ascertained by some standard referable to the contract itself, suf
ficiently certaim to enable the plaintiff to aver it in his affidavit or the
jury to find it. Price v. Cox, 83-261 ; Wilson v. Mfg Co., 88-5.
An attachment does not lie in an action for breach of promise. Price
v. Cox, 83-261.
«
Non-residence. — A person voluntarily removing from this state to
another, for the purpose of discharging the duties of an office of unlimite:l duration, requiring his presence there for an indefinite time, is a
non-resident of this state for the purposes of attachment, though he
may occasionally visit the state, and intend to return at some indefinite
future time. Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21 : Carden v. Carden, 107-214.
An affidavit upon which a warrant of attachment is based must be in
writing, and must show that the defendant is a " non-resident and has
property in this state." Windley v. Bradway, 77-333.
The prominent idea is, that the debtor must be a non-resident of the
state wnere the attachment is sued out, not that he must be a resident
elsewhere. His property is attachable if his residence is not such as to
subject him personally to the jurisdiction of the court and place him
upon an equality with other residents in this respect. Carden v. Car
den, 107-214.
Validity of warrant, how determined. —The validity of an order of arrest
and attachment is determined by the facts alleged in the original affida
vit, and existing when the proceedings were commenced, not upon new
matter thereafter transpiring. Devries v. Summit, 86-J26.
Requirements in affidavit.—The affidavit must comply strictly with all the
requirements of the statute. Marsh v. Williams, 63-371 ; Love v. Young,
69-6.S ; Spier v. Halstead, 71-209 ; Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21.
Affidavit need not allege that court has jurisdiction, jior. that defend
ant has property. Branch v. Frank, 81-180.
Amendment of affidavit. —A plaintiff has a right to amend his affidavit as
to mere matters of form ; and if he is ready to swear to the amended
affidavit, it is error in the clerk to refuse it. Palmer v. Bosher, 71-291.
The Code gives to the superior courts the most ample power to allow
amendments, and where an affidavit upon which a warrant of attach
ment was issued was defective, it may be amended. Penniman v. Daniel,
93-333Amendment allowed by clerk. —The clerk has power to permit an amend
ment affecting the substance of an affidavit in attachment proceedings.
Cushing v. Styron, 104-338.
Verification by agent. —The requirements as to an "agent " under The
Code, \ 258 (C. C. P., 117), do not apply to affidavits by an agent under
this section. Bruff v. Stern, 81-183.
Affidavit on information and belief.—An affidavit which states that the
defendant has left the state with intent, as the affiant is informed and
believes, to avoid the service of summons, is a substantial compliance
with this section. Being a fact accomplished, the reasons need not be
given on which the belief is founded. Hess v. Brower, 76-428 ; Clark v.
Clark, 64-150.
To the same effect also Hughes v. Person, 63-548 ; Smith v. Gibson,
74-684: Wood v. Harrell, 74-338, and Wilson v. Barnhill, 64-121, cited
under \ 291, in which the same principle is applied in " Arrest and Bail."
An affidavit which alleges that the affiant "believes that the defend
ants have disposed of their property, and are still doing so, with the
intent to defraud their creditors ;" also, " thai the defendants are largely
indebted, if not insolvent, have sold and are selling their large stock of
goods at less than the cost of the same in the city of ♦few York, and
have disposed of other valuable property for cash," is amply sufficient.
Gashine v. Baer, 64-108.
It is sufficient ground for the belief that th* defendant is "about to
assign, dispose of, or secrete," etc.; that "the goods were secretly
remo\-ed, after night-fall, from their usual place," and that " the persons
having them when overtaken, several miles distant, made conflicting
statements in regard to where they were going, and whose property they
had. Brown v. Hawkins, 65-645.
• Where a plaintiff in attachment makes oath that he believes or appre
hends that defendant will remove his property, he must also state the
grounds for such belief, Penniman v. Daniel, 90-154.
Affidavit sufficient. —An affidavit that the defendant had made an assign
ment to his father-in-law, the trustee being a preferred creditor for more
than the value of the entire assets ; that the assignment provided that
the general creditors should be paid only 0n condition of releasing all
claims ; that the trustee, a non-resident, had delegated the discharge of
the trust to his son and the assigning debtor, and stating further that
the defendant had secreted and disposed of his property, with intent,
as the affiant believed, to defraud the plaintiff, is sufficient to continue
the attachment till the trial. Bruff v. Stem, 81-183.
An affidavit for an attachment, stating that the defendant is a non
resident in this state, or has removed, or is about to remove, some of his
property from this state with: intent to defraud creditors, is sufficient.
The statute puts the modes in the alternative, and the plaintiff succeeds
if he establishes either. Penniman v. Daniel, 90-154.
Affidavit insufficient. —An affidavit in attachment proceedings which fails
to allege that the defendant "cannot, after due diligence, be found in this
state," does not warrant an order of publication. Faulk v. Smith,
84-501.
An affidavit that " the defendant has departed from this state, or keeps
himself concealed therein to avoid service of the summons with intent
to defraud his creditors," is not sufficient to authorize an order of pub
lication. Ibid.
A warrant of attachment cannot be supported by an allegation in the
affidavit that the defendant is about to remove from the state to defraud
his creditors ; but such an allegation-is material in an affidavit for a war
rant of arrest. Upon motion to vacate such warrant, the judge may
consider affidavits and any proper evidence adduced by the respective
parties, to establish or controvert the allegations of the affidavit upon
which the warrant was issued ; and his findings of facts upon the same
are conclusive. Hale v. Richardson, 89-62.
Effect of insufficient affidavit. —In attachment proceedings, the insuffici
ency of an affidavit does not make the whole proceeding void. It makes
the judgment irregular only, but not liable to be impeached collaterally.
Spilman v. Williams, 91-483.
Note. —In what cases an attachment would have issued prior to C. C
P., see Battle's Digest, vol. 1, pp. 107, 108.

The plaintiff, within thirty days after obtaining a war
rant of attachment from a justice of the peace, shall cause
publication thereof to be made for four successive weeks at
the court-house door, and four other public places in the
county where the warrant is returnable.
Essentials of an affidavit for publication. —In case of publication every
thing necessary to dispense with personal service must appear, and the
affidavit will be fatally defective if it fail to state that the defendant
cannot, after due diligence, be found in the state. Wheeler v. Cobb,
75-21 ; Faulk v. Smith, 84-501.
Or, where it does state that he is a non-resident, but omits to state
that he has property therein. Spier v. Halstead, 71-209.
Or, that he has disposed of property, etc., with intent io defraud his
creditors. Marsh v. Williams, 63-371.
Or, where it states that he "is absent, so that process cannot be served
upon him," if it omit to allege that his absence is with intent to defraud
his creditors, and to avoid the service of summons. Love v. Young,
69-65- .
Deposit of summons and complaint in post-office. —In a proceeding by
attachment, where the order for the publication for the summons was
for four weeks instead of six, and no order was made to deposit a copy
of the summons and complaint in the post-office, directed to the defend
ant, nor was such deposit made, the attachment should be vacated.
Burwell v. Lafferty, 76-383.

If the action be not founded on a contract, or if founded
on a contract, and the sum demanded exceed two hundred
dollars, a warrant of attachment may be obtained from the
judge of the district embracing the county in which the
action has been instituted, or from the clerk of the superior
court from which the summons in the action issued, and it
may be issued to any county in the state where the defend
ant has property, money, effects, choses in action or debts
due him, and shall be made returnable in term time to the
court from which the summons issued.
Clerk acts ministerially. —The clerk only acts ministerially in issuing
the process for attachment. Evans v. Etheridge, 96-42.
Clerk may issue in his own favor. — A clerk of the superior court, upon
making the necessary affidavit before some person authorized by law,
may issue a warrant of attachment in an action in which he is plaintiff.
Evans v. Etheridge, 96-42.
Clerk may issue out of term.—The clerk has authority, out of term time,
to grant a warrant of attachment. Cushing v. Styron, 104-338.
Sec. 352. Warrant, hwv served. 1870-'l, c. Hid, x. 3.
1874-'5,c. 111,8. 2. ,
When the warrant of attachment is taken out at the time
of issuing the summons, and the summons is to be served
by publication, the order shall direct that notice be given
in said publication to the defendant of the issuing of the
attachment, and when the warrant of attachment is obtained
after the issuing of the summons, the defendant shall be
notified by publication of the fact for four successive weeks
in some newspaper published in the county to which it is
returnable, or, if there be none such, then in one published
in the judicial district including said county, and if there
be no newspaper published in the district^ then in anyv
newspaper published in the state. Said publication shall
state the names of the parties, the amount of the claims,
and, in a brief way, the nature of the demand and the time
and place to which the warrant is returnable: Provided,
that in proceedings by attachment begun and had before
justices of the peace, advertisement in a newspaper shall
not be necessary, but in all such cases advertisement at the
court-house door and four other public places in the county
shall be sufficient publication, both as to the summons and
warrant of attachment.
Publication for five weeks. —Where notice of an attachment and sum
mons were published in one notice for five weeks, it was held a sufficient
publication of the notice of the attachment, but not of the summons.
Bank v. Blossom, 92-695.
As to publication of summons, see 219, ante, and 602, post.
Defective publication. —Where an application to vacate a warrant of
attachment-is made to the clerk before the term of the court to which the
summons is returnable, a further order of publication to cure a defective
service may be granted on affidavit without discharging the attachment.
Pennitnan v. Daniel, 90-154.
Sec. 353. When warrant granted by a justice of the peace.
C. C. P., s. 200. 187<>-'7, c. 251.
If the action be not founded on contract, and the value
of the property in controversy does not exceed the sum of
fifty dollars, the warrant of attachment may, or if the action
be founded on contract, and the sum demanded does not
exceed two hundred dollars, the warrant of attachment
must be obtained from, and made returnable before some
justice of the peace of a county td the superior court of
which it might have been returnable had the sum demanded
exceeded two hundred dollars, or had the action not have
been founded on contract.
Sec. 354. Justice's attachment levied on land; what to be
done. 1808-'9, c. 95, 8. 4.
If the attachment be levied on real property, the justice
shall proceed to try the action, but shall issue no execution
to sell the real property, and shall return the papers in the
case to the office of the clerk of the superior court of his
county, where the judgment shall be docketed. The levy
of the attachment, however, shall be a lien on the real
estate.
Judgment conclusive.—A judgment of the superior court, upon a justice's
execution or attachment levied on land, under which judgment there
was an execution and sale of the land, precludes all collateral enquiry
into the regularity of the previous proceedings. Grier v. Rhyne, 67-333.
Sec. 355. Warrant procured; affidavits to be filed. C. C.
P., 8. 201.
It shall be the duty of tho plaintiff procuring a warrant
of attachment, within ten days from the issuing thereof, to
file the affidavits on which the same was granted, in the
office of the clerk of the superior court to which, or with
the justice of the peace before whom, the process is made

Eight to amend. —Plaintiff has a right to amend his affidavit as to mat
ters of form. Palmer v. Bosher, 71-291.
See \ 349, ante, and cases there cited.
Sec. 350, Undertaking before issuing a warrant. C. C. P.,
8. 202.
Before issuing the warrant, the officer issuing the same
shall require a written undertaking on the part of the plain
tiff, with sufficient surety, to the effect that if the defend
ant recover judgment, or the attachment be set aside by
order of the court, the plaintiff will pay all costs that may
be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he
may sustain by reason of the attachment, not exceeding
the sum specified in the undertaking, which shall be at
least two hundred dollars.
Probable cause. —To recover damages for wrongful suing out an attach
ment, malice or want of probable cause must be shown. Williams v.
Hunter, 10-545 ; Kirkham v. Cox, 46-423.
Sec. 357. Warrant, to whom directed and what to require.
C. C. P., s. 203.
The warrant shall be directed to the sheriff of any county
in which the property of such defendant may be, or in case
it be issued by a justice of the*peace to such sheriff, or to
any constable of such county, provided such county be
that of the justice issuing the warrant, and shall require
such sheriff or constable to attach and safely keep all the
property of such defendant within his county, or so much
thereof, as may be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's demand,
the amount of which must be stated in conformity with the
complaint, together with costs and expenses ; it must also
state when and where it shall be returned. Several war
rants may be issued at the same time to the sheriffs of dif
ferent counties.
No return day specified in warrant. —An attachment which specifies no
day or place of return, is irregular, and will be vacated on motion.
Backalau v. Littlefield, 64-233.
Such defect is waived, if the defendant appear and give an undertak
ing for the delivery of the property. Ibid.
Exemptions. —Property seized under attachment is only a legal deposit •
in the hands of the sheriff to abide the event of the action, and after
judgment against the defendant, he is entitled to the same exemptions
in the property attached as if there had been no attachment. Gamble v.
Rhyue, 80-183.
Sec. 358. Validity of undertaking.
It shall not be a defence to an action upon an undertak
ing, given upon granting a warrant of attachment, that the
warrant was granted improperly, for want of jurisdiction,
or for any other cause.
Sec. 359. Warrant, how executed. C. C. P., a. 204.
The officer to whom such warrant of attachment is
directed and delivered, shall seize and take into his possession the tangible personal property of the defendant, or so
much thereof as may be necessary, and he shall be liable
for the care and custody of such property, as if the same
had been seized under execution ; he shall levy on the real
estate of the defendant as prescribed for executions ; he
shall make and return with the warrant an inventory of the
property seized and levied on ; subject to the direction of
the court, he shall collect and receive into his possession all
debts owing to the defendant, and take such legal proceed
ings, either in his own name, or in that of the defendant,
as may be necessary for that purpose.
Upon what levied. —A levy on land, under an attachment issued by a
justice of the peace is sufficient, if it gives such a description as will
distinguish and identify the land. Grier v. Rhyne, 67-330.
When A enters into an agreement with B, to save the cargo of a
wrecked vessel for a certain per cent, of its value, and lands a portion of
it on the beach, in a place of safety, they are joint tenants in the prop
erty saved, and the interest of A is liable to attachment. Insurance Co.
v. Davis, 68-17.
An attachment can be levied on a fund belonging to the defendant
and in the hands of an agent. Blair v. Puryear, 87-101.
Note.—As to what property may or may not be attached, see, also,
Battle's Digest, vol. 1, pp. 108 and iio.t ilrt iia^f, f<!>'^
Service upon debtor to defendant.—A warrant of attachment, served on a
debtor to the defendant, does not subject such person to have judgment
taken against him in the pending action, but only to a separate action
for its recovery. Carmer v. Evers, 80-55.
Exemptions. —The personal property of a resident of this state, exempted
from sale under execution by the constitution, cannot be sold under
process of attachment. Commissioners v. Riley, 75-144 ; Gamble v.
Rhyne, 80-183.
Returnable before clerk.—The act suspending The Code, (actsof i868-'6a,
chapter 76,) does not affect the return of the warrant of attachment. It
is still returnable before the clerk. Backalan v. Littlefield, 64-233.
NoTe.—For return of attachment under former system, see Battle's
Digest, vol. 1, pp. 11o, i11. '
Vacated by clerk.—The clerk of the superior court has jurisdiction to
vacate an attachment, notwithstanding the act of 187o-'71, chapter 166,

Sec. 3OO. Proceedings when property attached is perish
able, or a vessel. R. C, c. 7,s. 6". 1777, c. 115, s. 2S. C. C.
P., a. 205.
If any property, so seized, shall be perishable, or of such
character that the expense of keeping it until the determi
nation of. the suit would be likely to exceed one-fifth of its
value, or if any part of it consists of a vessel, or of any
share or interest therein, and the person to whom it belongs,
or his agent, shall not within ten days after the serving of
such attachment, reclaim the same, the sheriff or other
officer having possession thereof, shall apply to the court
for authority to sell the same, stating the circumstances ;
and the same shall be sold, under the order and direction
of the court, and the proceeds of such sale shall be liable
to the judgment obtained upon such attachment, and shall
be retained by the sheriff or other officer to await such
judgment.
Cost and expenses not chargeable against the fund, when. —Where an attach
ment against A is levied upon the goods of B, which being perishable
are sold by the sheriff, and B interpleads in the action and recovers
judgment, the costs and expenses of the attachment, sale, etc., are not
properly chargeable against the fund arising from such sale. Haywood
v. Hardie, 76-384.
Sec. 301. Defendant may replevy before sale. R.C.,c.7's.
5. 1777, c. 115,8. 28.
The person owning the property, advertised to be sold
according to the provisions. of this sub-chapter, his agent
or attorney may, at any time before sale, replevy the same,
by giving an undertaking, in double the amount of the
value of the property, with sufficient surety, to the effect
that he will return the property to the sheriff, or other
officer, if return thereof be adjudged by the court, and
pay all costs that may be awarded against him ; and if
return of said property cannot be had, then that he will
pay plaintiff the value of said property, and all costs and
damages that may be awarded against him. And upon
the execution of this undertaking, the sheriff or other
officer, shall deliver said property to the person owning the
same.
Form of bond. —A bond, payable to the plaintiff'in an attachment and
conditioned for the appearance of the defendant, etc., is not a "bail
bond " under this section, and by executing such a bond the defendant
does not acquire a right to replevy. Barry v. Sinclair, 61-7.
Sec. 302. Interest in corporations or associations liable to
attachment. C. O. P., s. 200.
. The rights or shares which the defendant may have in
the stock of any association or corporation, together with
the interests and profits thereon, and all other property in
this state of such defendant, shall be liable to be attached
and levied on, and sold to satisfy the judgment and exe
cution.
Lien dates from levy. —The lien of an attachment takes effect from its
levy, hence in an action to compel a corporation to transfer certain
stocks on its books, which the plaintiff had purchased at execution sale
after it had been attached to answer the judgment, and the defendant
answered that said stock had been transferred by the judgment debtor
before the rendition of the judgment, but did not aver that such trans
fer was before the levy of the attachment, the answer did not raise an
issue, or set up a substantial defence. Morehead v. Railroad, 96-362.
Sec. 30.3. Attachment, how executed on property incapable
of manual delivery. C. V. P., s. 207.
The execution of the attachment upon any such rights,
shares, or any debts or other property incapable of manual
delivery to the sheriff, shall be made, by leaving a certified
copy of the warrant of attachment with the president or
other head of the association or corporation, or with the
secretary, cashier or managing agent thereof, or with the
debtor or individual holding such property, with a notice
showing the property levied on.
Purchaser at attachment sale. —It is intimated that the purchaser of
shares of an incorporated company, at a sale under an attachment
against the party who appears ou the stock-book of the corporation to
be the owner, gets a title superior to that of a transferee from such
apparent owner, who has not had the transfer made on the books of the
corporation. Morehead v. Railroad, 96-362.
Sec. 304. A garnishee summoned to answer on oath ; judg
ment against garnishee. R. C, c. 7, s. 7. 1777, c. I lit,
s. 28.
When the sheriff or other officer shall serve an attach
ment on any person supposed to be indebted to, or to have
any effects of the defendant in the attachment, he shall at
the same time summon such person as a garnishee in writing, to appear at the court to which the attachment shall
be returnable, or if issued by a justice of the peace, at a
place and time named in the notice, not exceeding twenty
days from date of notice, to answer upon oath what he owes
to the defendant, and what effects of the defendant he hath
in his hands, and had at the time of serving such attach
ment, and what effects or debts of the defendant there
are in the hands of any other, and what person, to his
knowledge and belief ; and when an attachment shall be
served on any garnishee in manner aforesaid, it shall be law
ful upon his appearance and examination to enter up judg
ment and award execution for the plaintiff against such
garnishee, for all sums of money due to the defendant from
him, and for all effects and estates of any kind belonging
to the defendant, in his possession or custody, for the use
of the plaintiff, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to
satisfy the debt and costs and all charges incident to levy
ing the same ; and all goods and effects whatsoever in the
hands of any garnishee belonging to the defendant, shall be
liable to satisfy the plaintiff's judgment, and shall be deliv
ered to the sheriff or other officer serving the attachment.
Lien of garnishment. —The lieii of the garnishment of the maker of note
logins from the time the summons was served upon him. Parker v.
Scott, 64-118.
Liability of garnishee. —When one is summoned as a garnishee in an
attachment, and owes a note which is negotiable, he has a right to insist
upon the production and surrender of the note, or upon an indemnity,
as in the case of a lost note, before judgment is taken against him upon
his garnishment. If he does not do so, he is still liable to a bona fide
endorsee. Shulen v. Bryson, 65-201.
Prior to C. C. P. —Where an original attachment issued, and the garni
shee died after service and before the return day of process, his adminis
trator cannot be required to answer said garnishment. Tate v. Morehead, 65-681.
For proceedings against garnishee under the above action (act of 1777)
prior to 1868, see following cases : Russell v. Hinton, 5-468 ; Freeman
v. Grist, 18-217; Patton v. Smith, 29-438; Myers v. Beeman, 31-116;
Houston v. Porter, 32-174; Ormond v. Move, 33-564, Tindell v. Wall,

,Sec. 305. Proceedings against garnishee failing to appear.
R. C„ c. 7, 8. 8. 1777, c. 1 15, s. 28. 1838, c. 2.
When any garnishee shall be summoned as aforesaid,
and shall fail to appear and discover on oath as directed,
the court, after solemnly calling the garnishee, shall enter
a conditional judgment against him, and thereupon a notice
shall issue against him returnable to the court having juris
diction, to show cause why final judgment shall not be
entered against him ; and if, upon due execution thereof,
such garnishee shall fail to appear at the time and place
named in the notice, and discover on oath in manner afore
said, the court shall confirm said judgment and award exe
cution for the plaintiff's whole judgment and costs ; and if,
upon examination of the garnishee, it shall appear to the
court that there is any of the defendant's estate in the hands
of any person who has not been summoned, the court shall,
upon motion of the plaintiff, grant a judicial attachment,
to be levied in the hands of every such person having any
of the estate of the defendant in his custody or possession,
who shall appear and answer, and shall be liable as other
garnishees.
Sec. 306. Garnishee denying he has any property ; issue to
be made up. R. C, c. 7, s. 9. 1793, c. 389, s. 2.
When any garnishee shall deny that he owes to, or has
in his possession any property of, the defendant, and the
plaintiff shall on oath suggest to the court the contrary ; or
when any garnishee shall make such a statement of facts
that the court cannot proceed to give judgment thereon,
then the court shall order an issue to be made up, which
shall be tried by a jury, and on their verdict judgment shall
be rendered: Provided, that in a court of a justice of the
peace, he may try such issue, unless a jury be demanded,
and then proceedings are to be conducted, in all respects,
as in jury trials before courts of justices of the pace.
Reply unnecessary. —It is unnecessary for the plaintiff to reply to the
answer of the garnishee, under oath, where the garnishee admits the
possession of the property received from the defendant, but sets up title
in himself. • Cowles v. Oaks, 14-96.
Sec. 367. Articles confessed by garnishee, to be valued by
jury and judgment for their value; in what cases gar
nishee excused. B.C.,c.7,s.11. 1793, c. 389, s. 1. 1794,
c. 424, s. 1.
When a garnishee shall, on oath, confess that he has in
his hands any property of the defendant of a specific nature,
or is indebted to such defendant, by any security or assump
tion, for the delivery of any specific article, except as here
inafter excepted, then the court shall immediately order a
jury to be impaneled and sworn to inquire of the value of
such specific property, and the verdict of the jury shall
subject such garnishee to the payment of the valuation, or
so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the debts
or damages, and costs to the plaintiff : Provided, that in a
court of a justice of the peace he may try such issue, unless
a jury be demanded, and then proceedings are to be con
ducted in all respects as in jury trials before courts of jus
tices of the peace: Providedfurther, that if such garnishee
shall also state in his answer that said specific property was
left or deposited in his possession by the defendant as a
bailment, or that he hath tendered said specific articles
agreeable to contract, and that they were refused by the
defendant, and that he then was, and always had been,
ready to deliver the same; or that he had such specific
articles at the time and place specified in such covenant or
agreement, ready to be delivered, and is still ready to
deliver the same, and such statement shall be admitted by
the plaintiff, or found by a jury or the court, then, in any
such case, the garnishee shall be exonerated by the delivery
of such specific articles to the sheriff, who shall proceed as
if attachment had been originally levied on the property.
Sec. 368. Judgment conditional against garnishee, when.
It. C, c. 7, ». 12. 1794, c. 424, s. 2.
When any garnishee shall declare in his answer that the
money or specific article due by him will become payable
or deliverable at a future day, and the same shall be admit
ted by the plaintiff or found by a jury or the court, in such
case conditional judgment shall be entered against the gar
nishee, and the plaintiff may obtain judgment against the
defendant for his demand, but shall not take final judgment
against the garnishee without notice to show cause.
Sec. 369. Certificate of defendant's interest to be furnished.
C. C. P., 8. 290.
Whenever the sheriff or other lawful officer, with a war
rant of attachment or execution, shall apply to any officer
mentioned in section three hundred and sixty-three, or to
any debtor or individual, for the purpose of attaching or
levying on the property of the defendant in such warrant,
such officer, debtor or individual shall furnish him with a
certificate under his hand, designating the number of rights
or shares of the defendant in such association or corpora
tion with any dividend or any incumbrance thereon, or the
amount and description of the property held by such asso
ciation, corporation or individual, for the benefit of, or debt
owing to, the defendant. If such officer, debtor or indi
vidual refuse to do so, he may be required by the court or
judge to attend before him and be examined, on oath, con
cerning the same, and obedience to such order may be
enforced by attachment.
Sec. 370. Judgment, hotv satisfied. C. C. P., s. 209.
In case judgment be entered for the plaintiff in such
action, the sheriff shall satisfy the same out of the property
attached by him, if it shall be sufficient for that purpose—
(1) By paying over to such plaintiff the proceeds of all
property sold by him, and of all debts or credits collected
by him, or so much as shall be necessary to satisfy such
judgment ;
(2) If any balance remain due, and an execution shall
have been issued on such judgment, he shall proceed to sell
under such execution so much of the attached property,
real or personal, except as provided in sub-division four of
this section, as may be necessary to satisfy the balance, if
enough for that purpose shall remain in his hands ; and in
case of the sale of any rights or shares in the stock of a cor
poration or association, the sheriff shall execute to the pur
chaser a certificate of sale thereof, and the purchaser shall
thereupon have all the rights and privileges in respect
thereto which were had by such defendant ;
(3) If any of the attached property belonging to the
defendant shall have passed out of the hands of the sheriff
without having been sold or converted into money, such
sheriff shall repossess himself of the same, and for that pur
pose shall have all the authority which he had to seize the
same under the attachment ; and any person who shall wil
fully conceal or withhold such property from the sheriff
shall be liable to double damages at the suit of the party
injured ;
(4) Until the judgment against the defendant shall be
paid, the sheriff may proceed to collect the notes and other
evidences of debt, and the debts that may have been seized
or attached, under the warrant of attachment, and to prose
cute any bond he may have taken in the course of such
proceedings, and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment
of the judgment.
At the expiration of six months, from the docketing of
the judgment, the court shall have power upon the petition
of the plaintiff, accompanied by an affidavit setting forth
fully all the proceedings which have been had by the
sheriff, since the service of the attachment, the property
attached, and the disposition thereof, and also the affidavit
of the sheriff that he has used due diligence, and endeavored
to collect the evidences of debt in his hands so attached,
and that there remains uncollected of the same any part or
portion thereof, to order the sheriff to sell the same upon
such terms and in such manner as shall be deemed proper.
Notice of such application shall be given to the defendant
or to his attorney, if the defendant shall have appeared in
the action. -In case the summons has not been personally
served on the defendant, the court shall make such rule or
order, as to service of notice, and time of service, as shall
be deemed just. When the judgment and all costs of the
proceedings shall have been paid, the sheriff, upon reason
able demand, shall deliver over to the defendant the residue
of the attached property, or the proceeds thereof.
What the sheriff can sell. —Property seized under an attachment is only
a legal deposit in the hands of the sheriff to abide the event of the action,
and when judgment is rendered and execution comes to the sheriff's
hands his power to hold is merged into the larger powers acquired by
him under the execution. Gamble v. Rhyne, 80-183.
The personal property exemption cannot be sold under process of
attachment. Com'rs v. Riley, 75-144; Gamble v. Rhyne, 80-183.
Judgment set aside, when. —When a judgment has been obtained in an
attachment against a corporation, sued by a wrong name, upon a fraudu
lent demand, and having no notice of the action, such judgment should
be set aside, and the company allowed to plead, although the same was
known by one name as well as another. Deep River Copper Co. v. Mar
tin, 70-300.
Sec. 37 I. When action to recover notes, etc., of defendant
may be prosecuted by plaintiff in the action in which the
attachment issued. C. C. P., s. 210.
The actions herein authorized to be brought by the sheriff
may be prosecuted by the plaintiff, or under his direction,
upon the delivery by him to the sheriff, of an undertaking
executed by two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the
plaintiff will indemnify the sheriff from all damages, costs
and expenses on account thereof, not exceeding two hun
dred and fifty dollars in any one action. Such sureties
shall, in all cases when required by the sheriff, justify by
making an affidavit that each is a freeholder, and worth
double the amount of the penalty of the bond, over and
above all demands, liabilities and exemptions.
A warrant of attachment vserved upon a debtor of the defendant is
merely a security for the plaintiff's recovery. It does not subject the garnishee to have judgment taken against him in the pending cause, but
only to a separate action for its recovery. Carmer v. Evans, 80-55.
See Shulen v. Bryson, cited under j1 364, ante.
Sec. 372. Bond of plaintiff, how disposed of on judgment
for defendant. C. C. P., s. 211.
If the foreign corporation or the absent, absconding or
concealed defendant recover judgment against, the plaintiff
in such action, any bond taken upon the issuing of the war
rant of attachment, and any bond taken by the sheriff,
except such as are mentioned in the preceding section, all
the proceeds of sales and moneys collected by him, and all
the property attached remaining in his hands, shall be
delivered by hiin to the defendant or to his agent, on
request, and the warrant shall be discharged and the prop
erty released.
Sec. 373. Attachment discharged, and property or its pro
ceeds returned to the defendant on his appearance in
action. C. C. P., s. 212. 1870-'l, c. 166.
Whenever the defendant shall have appeared in such
action, he may apply to the court in which such action is
pending, or to the judge thereof, for an order to discharge
the same ; and if the same be granted, all the proceeds of
sale, and moneys collected in such action, and all the prop
erty attached remaining in the hands of any officer of the
court, under any process or order in such action, shall be
delivered or paid to the defendant or to his agent, and
released from the attachment. And where there is more
than one defendant, and several property of either of the
defendants has been seized by virtue of the order of attach
ment, the defendant, whose several property has been seized,
may apply in like manner for relief.
Motion to vacate, when made. —A motion to dissolve an order of attach
ment may be made before the return term of the summons. Palmer v.
Bosher, 71-291 ; Wilson v. Manufacturing Co., 88-5.
Vacated by clerk. —The clerk has jurisdiction to vacate an attachment,
notwithstanding the act of 1870-'7 1, making the process returnable to
term of court. Palmer v. Bosher, 71-291.

When vacated. —An attachment or other provisional remedy will be
vacated without any undertaking by the defendant, if on its face, it
appears to have been issued irregularly, or for a cause insufficient in
law, or false in fact Bear v. Cohen, 65-511.
Where a defendant moves to vacate an attachment without having
served a copy of his affidavit, and the plaintiff appears by attorney and
does not ask to file counter-affidavits, the motion may yet be granted.
Palmer v. Bosher, 72-371.
When not vacated. —An attachment will not be dissolved, if it appear
reasonably necessary to hold the propertv to protect the plaintiff's rights
till the trial. Bruff v. Sterns, 81-183.
When court should find the facts. —It is not necessary that the court
below should set forth in its judgment upon a motion to vacate a war
rant of attachment, the findings of fact upon which the judgment is
based, unless it is claimed that the court erred in applying the law to
the facts as found. In such case, it is the duty of the court to set out
the findings of fact. Milhiser v. Balsley, 106-433.
Release of lien by act of the plaintiff. —A plaintiff, in an attachment levied
on the propert}' of the debtor, accepting a deed of trust from such debtor
to all his creditors, and signing an agreement providing for the pay
ment of the debts of the debtor pro rata, releases the lien acquired by
the levy of the attachment, and must take his part with the creditors
secured in the deed. Rahily v. Stringfellow, 72-328.
Defect in affidavit cured. —Where the affidavit was insufficient, and the
defendant moved to vacate on affidavits, and the plaintiff then filed
counter-affidavits, which supplied the facts omitted in the former one,
the counter-affidavits cured the defects of the original, but could not
have been filed if the defendant had not moved on affidavits. Brown
v. Hawkins, 65-645.
What judge can vacate. —A judge has no authority to vacate attach
ments, except in his own district (before the law of i876-'7), but ajudge
holding a series of courts in a district by exchange becomes, during
such courts, judge of the district for all purposes. Bear v. Cohen,65-51 1 ;
Myers v. Hamilton, 65-567; Thomas v. Whitehead, 65-637.
Property delivered to the defendant. —Upon vacating the warrant, the
property attached and money collected under any process or order in
the action shall be delivered to the defendant. Devries v. Summit,
86-126.
Prior to C. C. P. —In an attachment for debt, objections to tie suffi
ciency of the affidavit or bond can only be taken by a plea in abate
ment, after an appearance by the defendant. Cherry v. Nelson, 52-141.
See \ 377, post, and cases there cited.
Sec. 374. Undertaking of defendant on appearance to dis
charge the property. C. C. P., 8. 213.
Upon such application the defendant shall deliver to the
court an undertaking, executed by two sureties residing in
this state, approved by such court, to the effect that such
surety will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the amount of
judgment that may be recovered against the defendant in
the action, not exceeding the sum specified in the under
taking, which shall be at least double the amount claimed
by the plaintiff in his complaint. If it shall appear by
affidavit, that the property attached be of less value than the
amount claimed by the plaintiff, the court or judge may
order the same to be appraised, and the amount of the
undertaking shall then be double the amount so appraised,
And where there is more than one defendant, and several
property of either of the defendants has been seized by
virtue of the order of attachment, the defendant whose
several property has been seized may deliver to the court
an undertaking, in accordance with this section, to the
effect that he will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the
amount of judgment that may be recovered against such
defendant. And all of this section, applicable to such an
undertaking, shall be applied thereto.
Before C. C. P. —Defendants in original attachments may appear and
plead without giving bail. Stephenson v. Todd, 63-368.
Sec. 375. Property claimed by'third party, may interplead.
R. C, c. 7, 8. 10. 1793, c. 389, «. 3.
When the property attached shall be claimed by any
other person, the claimant may interplead, as provided in
section three hundred and thirty-one.
Who may interplead. —An attachment having been levied, third parties
claiming a lien on the property can intervene and make up a collateral
issue as to the title. But whether the attachment is regular is matter
between the parties to the main action. Blair v. Puryear, 87-101.
The right of an outside claimant to intervene is well settled by prece
dent. Sims v. Goettle, 82-268.
A stranger to the action has no right to intervene and make himself a
party thereto, though upon proof of interest in the property attached
he may be allowed to make up a collateral issue of title. Toms v. Warson, 66-417.
Burden of proof.—The burden of proof is on the intervener. Wallace
v. Robeson, 100-206.
Decisions upon this section (actB 1793, Rev. Code, c. 7. s. 10) made prior to
1868. —A party claiming title to property seized under an attachment,
may interplead at any time before final judgment. Dodson v. Bush,
4-236; Evans v. Transportation Co., 50-331.
The claim of an interpleader to property attached must be a legal
claim; a mere equitable one will not entitle him to the property attached.
No claim can be interposed by a third person to a debt attached in the
hands of a garnishee, as nothing but tangible property comes within the
spirit of the law allowing an interpleader. But where specific property
is levied upon, as the property of an absconding debtor, claimants have
a right to interpose for the purpose of protecting their present enjoy
ment of it, and preventing any injury that might attend any removal.
Simpson v. Harry, 18-202.
The owner of property attached is not obliged to interplead, though
he may do so for the sake of convenience. A sale under an execution,
issuing on a judgment on an attachment, only passes the right of the
defendant in attachment. Davis v. Garrett, 25-459. iiSTt^iu-r)
When- an interplea is filed, the only issue submitted to the jury is as
to the title to the property levied on. The jury have no right to assess
the value of the property or damages for its detention or destruction.
McLean v. Douglas, 28-233.
A plaintiff in a junior attachment cannot be allowed to intervene in
an attachment of earlier date for the purpose of contesting the validity
of the debt therein sued on. Bank v. Spurling, 52-398.
Sec. 370. When the sheriff to return warrant, with his pro
ceedings thereon. C. C. 1'., s. 214.
The sheriff shall return the warrant of attachment, and
the undertakings provided for in this chapter, with a state
ment of his proceedings thereon, at the time and place at
which it is on its face returnable, and upon, or at any time
after such return, he may obtain from the court to which
the same was returnable, a certified copy thereof, which
shall be held and deemed for the purpose of giving him
authority, the same as the original, and when the warrant
shall have been fully executed or discharged, the sheriff
shall return the same, with his proceedings, to said court.
Sec. 377. Motion to vacate or modify warrant, or increase
security.
The defendant, or a person who has acquired a lien upon,
or interest in, his property after it was attached, may at any
time before the actual application of the attached property,
or the proceeds thereof, to the payment of a judgment
recovered in the action, apply to the court having jurisdic
tion to vacate or modify the warrant, or to increase the
security given by the plaintiff, or for one or more of those
forms of relief, together or in the alternative, as in cases of
other provisional remedies.
Ilotion granted. —Where the allegations of the affidavit for attachment
are disproved, the motion to vacate should be granted. Devries v. Sum
mit, 86-126.
'
Motion denied.—The court will not surrender property in custodia legis
if its detention appear reasonably necessary to protect the right of the
plaintiff till the trial. Bruff v. Stern, 81-183.
Amendment of defective affidavit. —The court has the power to allow the
amendment of an affidavit upon which a warrant of attachment had
issued, although the former affidavit was wholly insufficient. Brown v.
Hawkins, 65-645.
Vacated without bond by defendant.—An attachment, or other provisional
remedy, will be vacated without any undertaking by the defendant, by
the judge, if on its face it appear to have been issued irregularly, or for
a cause insufficient in law or false in fact. Bear v. Cohen, 65-511.
What judge has jurisdiction to vacate. —A judge cannot vacate an order
of attachment out of his own district, unless legally assigned to hold
the court of the district where it issued. Myers v. Hamilton, 65-567 ;
Bear v. Cohen. 65-511 ; Morris v. Whitehead, 65-637.

Sec. 378. Exceptions to and justification of sureties.
The sureties to all undertakings in all proceedings for
attachment may be excepted to, and justified as required
in action for claim and delivery.
See \l 324-328, ante.
Sec. 379. Appointment of receivers. C. C. P., s. 215.
187<i-'7, c. 223. 1879, c. 03. 1881, c. 51. 1885, c. 94.
A judge of the superior court, having authority to grant
restraining orders and injunctions, as prescribed in title
nine, sub-chapter three of this chapter, shall have the like
jurisdiction in appointing receivers, and all motions to show
cause shall be returnable as is provided for injunctions.
A receiver may be appointed—
(1) Before judgment, on the application of either party,
when he establishes an apparent right to property which is
the subject of the action and which is in the possession of
an adverse party, and the property or its rents and profits
are in danger of being lost or materially injured or im
paired, except in cases where judgment upon failure to
answer may be had on application to the court;
(2) After judgment, to carry the judgment into effect;
(3) After judgment, to dispose of the property according
to the judgment, or to preserve it during the pendency of
an appeal, or when an execution has been returned unsat
isfied, and the judgment debtor refuses to apply his prop
erty in satisfaction of the judgment;
(4) In cases provided in said chapter and by special
statutes, when a corporation has been dissolved, or is insol
vent, or in imminent danger cf insolvency, or has forfeited
its corporate rights, and in like cases of the property within
this state of foreign corporations. Receivers of the prop
erty within this state of foreign or other corporations shall
be allowed such commissions as may be fixed by the judge
appointing them, not exceeding five per cent, on the amount
received and disbursed by them.
Amendment (ch. 94, acts 1885).
In all cases where there is an application for the appoint
ment of a receiver, upon the ground that the property or its
rents and profits are in danger of being lost or materially
injured or impaired, or that a corporation defendant is
insolvent or in immediate danger of insolvency, and the
subject of the action is the recovery of a money demand,
the judge before whom such application is made or pend
ing shall have the discretionary power to refuse the appoint
ment of a receiver if the party against whom such relief
is asked, whether a person, partnership or corporation,
shall tender to the court an undertaking payable to the
adverse party in an amount double the sum demanded by the
plaintiff, with at least two sufficient sureties and duly jus
tified according to law, conditional for the payment of such
amount as may be recovered in such action, and summary
judgment may be taken upon said undertaking as in the
case of official bonds under sections one thousand eight
hundred and eighty-nine and one thousand eight hundred
and ninety of The Code: Provided, that in the progress of
the action the court shall have power, in its discretion, to
require additional sureties on such undertaking.
Powers of courts, as to appointment of receivers, enlarged. —In certain
respects, particularly with regard to the remedies by injunction and
appointment of receivers, the powers of the courts have been enlarged
by the provisions of The Code. Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93-22.
By whom appointed. —The clerk of the superior court has no power to
appoint a receiver. Parks v. Sprinkle, 64-637.
Under the act of 1877, modified by the act of 1879, .motions for the
appointment of a receiver may be made before the resident judge of the
district, or one assigned to the district, or one holding the courts thereof
by exchange, at the option of the mover. Corbin v. Berry, 83-27.
Prior application. —The prior jurisdiction acquired by the pendency of a
former action in which an injunction and receivership is sought will
exclude the interference of the court in another suit of which the princi
pal object is the same provisional remedies. Young v. Rollins, 85-485.
Authority of receiver. —A receiver appointed in one case, cannot, by
virtue of such appointment, do any act affecting another controversy
between the parties. Righton v. Pruden, 73-61.
A party to the action should not be appointed. —The office of receiver
should not be conferred on a partv to the cause. Young v. Rollins, 85485.
Property in hands of receiver not subject to execution. —While property is
in the hands of a receiver it is not subject to execution, and no right to
it can be acquired by a sale under execution. It makes no difference if
the receiver declines to act. The property is still in the custody of the
- law. Skinner v. Maxwell, 68-400.
Receiver in actions to recover real property,—In an action tt> recover pos
session of land, a defendant may set up an equitable defence, and all
persons interested in such equity should thereupon be made parties, and
are entitled to have their interests protected by the appointment of a
receiver. Ten Broeck v. Orchard, 74-409.
A receiver will be appointed, in an action to recover realty, when the
plaintiff sets up an apparently good title, which is not sufficiently denied
by the answer, and shows imminent danger of loss by the defendant's
insolvency. Deep River Co. v. Fox, 39-61 ; Gause v. Perkins, 56-177 ;
Nesbitt v. Turrentine, 83-535 ; Rollins v. Henry, 77-467.
After a tenant has been wrongfully evicted and a writ of restitution
ordered, it must be obeyed before the court will entertain a motion to
appoint a receiver of the premises. Rollins v. Henry, 77-467.
Where it appears that the party in possession of a gold mine, pending
litigation for tt, is of doubtful ability to respond in damages, a receiver
will be appointed to secure the profits. Parker v. Parker, 82-165.
In actions of ejectment, the requirement that the defendant shall give
bond before answering, does not abridge the power of the court to
appoint a receiver of the rents and profits. Kron v. Dennis, 90-327.
Where, in an action to recover land, the complaint alleged and the an
swer admitted that the defendant was in possession of the entire tract, but
in fact the plaintiff was in possession of a portion of it, and upon a motion
for a receiver, the defendant was allowed to retain possession of the entire
tract upon filing a bond, which was done, it was not error to allow the
order appointing the receiver to be so modified as to only embrace the
land actually occupied by the defendant. Kron v. Smith, 96-386.
Where a party establishes an apparent right to land, and the person in
possession is insolvent, a receiver will be appointed to take charge of the
rents and profits during the pendency of the action. McNair v. Pope,
96-502.
In a contest over a will. —A receiver cannot be appointed in a proceed
ing to establish a will. Bryan v. Moring, 94-694.
When, on an issue of devisavil vel non, the jury find a certain paperwriting to be the will, and persons are in possession claiming under a
prior script, it is error to appoint a receiver of rents and profits when
there is no allegation of insolvency against the party in possession. Ibid.
In action of foreclosure. —Where land is sold by deed, and the vendee
immediately re-conveys by mortgage to secure the purchase-money,
enters into possession, makes improvements, and obtains an injunction
to restrain sale under the mortgage, the vendee is entitled to have a
receiver appointed during the litigation. Howes v. Mauney, 66-218.
A receiver may be appointed in an action to foreclose a mortgage,
when it is alleged that the security is insufficient, and the mortgagor in
possession is insolvent. Kerchner v. Fairley, 80-24.
Where a mortgagor obtains an injunction to restrain the sale of mort
gaged premises until certain counterclaims are passed upon, the mort
gagee is entitled to have a receiver appointed to take charge of the prop
erty and secure the rents and profits, where the same are in danger of
being lost. Oldham v. Bank, 84-304.
Executor. —When an executor converts his real and personal estate into
notes and money, so as to lead to a reasonble apprehension that the
assets are not sufficiently secure in his hands, it becomes the duty of
the court, pending an action for an account and payment of the assets,
to provide, by an order in the cause, that the executor give bond for the
protection of the assets anil for. the performance of the final decree, and
upon his failure so to do, to appoint a receiver. It is error to appoint a
receiver in the first instance. Gray v. Gaither, 74-237.
Where lands were devised to two persons, both of whom were
appointed uxecutors. charged with the payment of certain debts, and
one of the executors, claiming a part of the land under a deed subse
quent in date to the execution of the will, had entered thereon and was proceeding to operate it as mining property, and it appearing that there
was some danger of waste of the property, and the solvency of the ven
dee-executor was doubtful ; it is a proper case for the appointment of a
receiver. Stith v. Jones, 101-360.

not vested in a trustee. Skinner v. Maxwell, 66-45.

ferent interests can only be ascertained and established under the direc
tion of the court, a receiver should be appointed. Ibid.
A receiver appointed to take charge of a ward's estate when the
guardian is removed is not invested with the powers of a guardian, but
acts under the control of the court until another guardian is appointed.
Temple v. Williams, 91-82.
Dissolution of partnership. —Where a court orders a dissolution of a
partnership, or where it is dissolved by consent and a serious disagree
ment occurs between the partners in settlement, the court will appoint
a receiver. Richards v. Burman, 65-162.
Tenants in common. —Courts are averse in ordinary cases to the appoint
ment of receivers in actions between tenants in common. Vaughn v.
Vincent, 88-116.
Cutting timber. —Where the plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant
from cutting and carrying away timber from lands which both parties
claimed, and each offered strong proofs in support of his title ; and it
appeared that the defendant had in good faith expended large sums of
money in establishing and prosecuting its business and great loss might
result from arresting it : Meld, that the court should have required a
bond from the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff for the value of the
timber, and if need be appoint a receiver, before resorting to an injunc
tion. Lewis v. Lumber Co., 99-11.
Disputed fund. —The right to take under the control of the court a dis
puted fund, liable to waste if suffered to remain in the hands of the
defendant, extends also to a plaintiff who takes it from the defendant,
and whose possession threatens a similar injury to the latter. Horton
v. White, 84-297.
A receiver will be appointed, when. —Where the trustee of the sinking
fund to pay the debts of a corporation loaned a portion of the money
belonging thereto without authority to a bankrupt firm of which he was
senior member, and which soon thereafter became insolvent, these facts
constitute sufficient grounds for the removal of the trustee and the
appointment of a receiver pending an investigation of his acts and
doings. Railroad v. Wilson, 81-223.
Where an administrator sold land to make assets, and it was bought
by his sister, either for his and their joint benefit, and judgment was
rendered against her and the sureties on the bond for the purchasemoney, the administrator, who is insolvent, remaining in possession of
the land, the sureties are entitled to an order restraining the adminis
trator from collecting the purchase-money and the appointment of a
receiver to resell the land. Stenhouse v. Davis, 82-432.
In an action under the landlord and tenant act, carried by appeal to
the superior court, the court has power to appoint a receiver to collect
the rents, etc., upon an affidavit by the plaintiff (not controverted) that
the defendants entered into possession as tenants of plaintiff, have held
over after expiration of their term, are insolvent, and that the plaintiff
has no security for rents. Nesbit v. Turrentine, 83-535.
Where the plaintiff establishes a primafacie right to property, which
is not rebutted by the defendant, he is entitled to a receiver, if he shows
that there is danger of loss of the rents and profits. Durant v. Crowell,
97-367.
Where there is reason to apprehend that the subject of the contro
versy will be destroyed, or removed, or otherwise disposed of by the
defendants, pending the action, so that the plaintiff may lose the fruit
of his recovery, the court will take control of it by the appoint
ment of a receiver, or by the grant of an injunction, or by both, tt nec
essary, until the action shall be tried on its merits. Ellett v. Newman,
92-519A receiver will not be appointed, when, —An order appointing a receiver
will not be made when the party applying for the same has not estab
lished an apparent right to the property in litigation, and where it is
neither alleged nor shown that there is danger of waste or injury to the
property, or loss of rents and profits by reason of the insolvency of the
adverse party in possession. Twitty v. Logan, 80-69.
A receiver will be refused unless there is danger that the property will
be lost or materially injured. Levensou v. Elson, 88-182.
A receiver will not be appointed pendente lite upon a mere allegation
that the party has reason to believe the property in dispute will be
wasted or destroyed. The application in such case must state the grounds
of apprehension, and the judge determines the reasonableness thereof
upon the facts found by him. Hanna v. Hanna, 89-68.
Where the application for a receiver is based upon the alleged fraud
ulent character of a conveyance, the question of whether or not the deed
is fraudulent, belongs to the final hearing of the cause, and the alleged
fraud will only be considered on such motion for a receiver, as showing
grounds for the protection of the fund until the final hearing. In such
case, a receiver will not be appointed, unless it is manifest that the fund is
mismanaged and in danger of being lost, or where the insolvency of an
unfit trustee is present or imminent. Rheinstein v. Bixby, 92-307.
It is the duty of the court, in passing upon a motion for an injunction
or the appointment of a receiver, to consider the consequences of such
action upon both parties ; and it ought not to interpose unless it is mani
fest that the property is being mismanaged and in danger of being lost,
or that it is in the possession of an insolvent or unfit trustee. Venable
v. Smith, 98-523.
Affidavits. —Where the defendant in an application for a provisional
remedy meets the plaintiff's allegations by counter-affidavits, the plain
tiffs can support their original affidavits by others to same effect and in
reply to those offered by the defendant. Young v. Rollins, 85-485.
Allowing or refusing additional affidavits after argument begun, on
such an application, is a matter of discretion in the presiding judge, and
not reviewable. Levenson v. Elson, 88-182.
On question of insolvency. —The value of the property in controversy
cannot be considered in passing on the question of the solvency of the
defendant. Durant v. Crowell, 97-367.
Acceptance of bond in lieu of appointment of receiver. —Where there is dan
ger of loss of rents and profits, instead of appointing a receiver, the
court may allow the defendant to execute a bond to secure the rents and
profits, and such damages as may be adjudged the plaintiff. Durant v.
Crowell, 97-367.
It is error to order the receiver to take possession and control of the
mines, and machinery for operating the same, without giving the defend
ant an opportunity to file a bond to secure the payment over to the receiver, of any proceeds therefrom, as the court might subsequently
direct. Stith v. Jones, 101-360.
See amendment to this section (ch. 94, act 1885), supra.
For the fees of an officer pending litigation. —A receiver cannot he ap
pointed to take the fees of an office. Swepson v. Turner, 76-115.
After dissolution of a corporation. —Where a corporation has dissolved,
and there is a contest as to the rights of different creditors to the assets,
there being no officers of the corporation, a receiver should be appointed.
Dobson v. Simonton. 78-63.
An order appointing a receiver of the extinct corporation, where it
has become extinct by a legislative enactment which transferred its
powers and property to a new corporation, cannot properly be made,
except in a proceeding to which its successor or substitute is a party,
Young v. Rollins, 85-485.
The organization of a new corporation at once dissolves the old one.
The creditors of the defunct corporation are entitled to have a receiver
appointed to apply its property to their debts. Marshall v. Railroad,
92-322.
A receiver appointed under the act (The Code, j1 670) to wind up the
affairs of corporations, can proceed to collect in the assets, and to prose
cute and defend suits, after the corporation has ceased to exist by the
expiration of its charter. Asheville v. Aston, 92-578.
Supplementary proceedings. —In supplementary proceedings, if the judg
ment debtor dies before the appointment of a receiver is filed in the office
of the clerk of the superior court, the property and effects of such judg
ment debtor do not vest in the receiver, nor has the judgment creditor
any lien as against the administrator. Rankin v. Minor, 72-424.
The appointment of a receiver in supplemental proceedings does not
rest solely in the discretion of the judge, and his action in appointing or
refusing to appoint is subject to review by the supreme court. It is not
necessary, in order to warrant the appointment of a receiver in such pro
ceedings, that it should appear with perfect certainty that the debtor has
property which ought to be applied to the payment of the judgment. It
is sufficient if there is reasonable ground to believe that he has such
property. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
In regard to the appointment by the court of receivers of the property
of the judgment debtor in cases of supplementary proceedings, see i,,t.
494-497, post.
Clerks superior court.—Prior to the enactment of \ 72 of The Code
(November, 1883), clerks of the superior courts were not liable upon their
official bonds for moneys received by them in the capacity of receivers
of funds belonging to infants ; but now, by virtue of that section, such
bonds are responsible for all moneys and effects which may come to
their hands by color of their office, or under any decree or order of a
judge, though such order or decree may have been irregular, or even
void for want of jurisdiction. Symev. Bunting, 91-48 ; Presson v. Boone,
108-78.
Appeal from order appointing receiver. —An appeal is the act of the party
and not of the court, and it rests upou the appellaut to show that it was
perfected. So where an order was made in term, appointing a receiver,
from which order the record showed that the defendant appealed, but it
did not appear that the appeal was perfected, the court has the power,
certainly by consent, after notice, to alter such order at chambers.
Coates v. Wilkes, 94-174.
Order not void.—An order appointing a receiver is not void by reason of
an omission of the court to require adequate security. Nesbitt v. Turrentine, 83-535.
Action by receiver. —A receiver of an insolvent corporation, appointed
by the circuit court of the United States, cannot bring an action in the
courts of this state, in his own name, to recover the property of such
corporation. Such action must be in the name of the real owner. Bat
tle v. Davis, 66-252.
Contra.—It seems that a trustee of any express trust may bring an
action in his own name. See \ 177, ante, and cases there cited, especially
Rankin v. Allison, 64-673; Biggs v. Williams, 66-427; Mebaue v. Mebane, 66-334 ; Setzer v. Lewis, 69-133; Grant v. Bell, 87-34.
A receiver appointed upon the dissolution of a corporation, or a trustee
charged with the collection of its assets, can bring suit against its debt
ors in his own name or in that of the corporation. Gray v. Lewis, 94392.
Sec. 380. Property held by trustee. C. C. P., s. 215.
When it is admitted by the pleading or examination of
a party that he has in his possession, or under his control,
any money or other thing capable of delivery, which, being
the subject of the litigation, is held by him as trustee for
another party, or which belongs or is due to another party,
the judge may order the same to be deposited in court, or
delivered to such party, with or without security, subject
to the further direction of the judge.
Insolvent trustee.—Where a trustee is insolvent and has misapplied the 1
rents and profits, an injunction and the appointment of a receiver are
properly granted. Albright v. Albright, 91-220.
Sec. 381. Judge may punish disobedience to order. C. C.
P., 8. 215.
Whenever, in his exercise of his authority, a judge shall
have ordered the deposit, delivery or conveyance of money
or other property, and the order is disobeyed, the judge,
besides punishing the disobedience as for contempt, may
make an order requiring the sheriff to take the money or
property and deposit, deliver or convey it; in conformity
writh the direction of the judge.
Sec. 382. Judgment for sum admitted to be due. C. C. P.,
s. 215.
When the answer of the defendant expressly, or by not
denying, admits part of the plaintiff's claim to be just, the
judge, on motion, may order such defendant to satisfy that
part of the claim, and may enforce the order as it enforces
a judgment or provisional remedy.
Sec. 383. Receiver to'give security.
A receiver appointed in an action or special proceeding
must, before entering upon his duties, execute and file with
the clerk of the court wherein the action is pending, .an
undertaking payable to the adverse party with at least two
sufficient sureties in a penalty fixed by the judge or jus
tices, making the appointment, conditioned for the faith
ful discharge of his duties as receiver. And the judge or
justices, having jurisdiction thereof, may at any time
remove the receiver, or direct him to give a new undertak
ing, with new sureties with the like condition. But this
section does not apply to a case where special provision is
made by law for the security to be given by a receiver, nor
for increasing the same, nor for removing a receiver.
Liability of sureties of clerk appointed receiver. —The sureties upon the
bond of a clerk of the superior court are not liable for funds which come
into his hands as receiver, and over which the court had acquired no
control. Rogers v. Odom, 86-432.
But where the clerk is appointed receiver under the statute author
izing the court to commit the estate of an infant to some discreet person,
the bond of the clerk is responsible for the fund. Ibid.
Since The Code of 1883, \ 72, the official bond of the clerk is respon
sible for funds committed to his care as receiver. Syme v. Bunting,
91-48.
Where it was shown that in December, 1882, the clerk of a superior
court, who had theretofore been appointed a receiver of funds belong
ing to a minor, received from an administrator a sum of money belonging
to the minor and gave a receipt therefor signed " clerk of the superior
court, and receiver of," etc.: Held, that he was liable upon his bond
as clerk, inasmuch as under '0, 1543, 1544 of The Code, it was made his
official duty to receive and account for all moneys, etc., paid into his
office by executors and administrators, and it will be presumed he
received the money bv virtue of that authoritv. Presson v. Boone,
108-78.
Responsibility of receiver. —As a general rule, a receiver is responsible
for his own neglect only, and is protected when he acts in entire good
faith, but when a receiver is appointed to take charge of an infant's
estate who has no guardian, and is directed to lend out the money and
pay the income over to the ward, he will be held to the same accounta
bility as a guardian. Collins v. Gooch, 97-186.
Deposit by receiver in bank. —A receiver, or other trustee, may keep
money in a bank as a safe place of deposit, or may use the bank as a
means of transmitting money to distant places, and if he uses reason
able diligence he will not be held liable if the bank fails, but this does
not authorize a loan to the bank by such trustee without taking security.
Collins v. Gooch, 97-186.
Default must be ascertained before suit against sureties. —A receiver and his
surety cannot be sued on the bond for au alleged breach of his trust
before a default is ascertained. The proper practice is to apply to the
court for a rule on the receiver to render his account. Bank v. Cred
itors, 86-323.
Leave to sue sureties, when granted. —Where the receiver's default is mani
fest, and he fails to comply with the order of the court in respect to the
fund, it is a breach of the bond upon which suit may be brought by
leave of the court. Bank v. Creditors, 86-323.
Where a receiver is alleged to have committed a breach of trust, the
party complaining must first obtain a rule requiring him to render an
account, and if default be found apply to the court for leave to sue his
bond. In this case the refusal of the motion for judgment against the
bond was proper. Atkinson v. Smith, 89-72.
Sec. 384. Judgment, defined. C. V. P., s. 216.
A judgment is either interlocutory, or the final determi
nation of the rights of the parties in the action.
Presumed to be correct. —Judgments of a court in a case properly con
stituted before it, and where it has jurisdiction of the parties and the
subject-matter of controversy, are deemed to be valid and will be upheld
until impeached by a direct proceeding for that purpose. Morris v.
Gentry, 89-248 ; State v. Lanier, 89-517.
Service of summons presumed. —The law presumes that a party to an
action has notice thereof and of its nature, but the contrary may be
shown in a proper proceeding for that purpose. Morris v. Gentrv, 89248.
Judgment stricken out by consent.—By consent, a judgment rendered at
a former term may be stricken out, and a new judgment substituted in
its place. Cowles v. Curry, 96-331.
Judgment in vacation. —By consent, judgment can be rendered in vaca
tion. Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243; Harrell v. Peebles, 79-26 ; Coates v.
Wilkes, 94-174 Shackleford v. Miller, 91-181.
Judgment against infants. —A judgment against an infant who has not
been served with process is not void, and will not be set aside to the
prejudice of a bona fide purchaser without notice. Hare v. Hollomon,
94-I4.
A judgment for or against an infant, when he appears by attorney, but
has no guardian or next friend, is not void, but only voidable. Tate v.
Mott, 96-19.
A judgment against an infant who has been served with process is not
void, but at most is only irregular and voidable. Syme v. Trice, 96-243.
See \ 387, post.
Judgment non obstante veredicto.—A judgment non obstante veredicto is
granted in cases where the plea confesses a cause of action and the mat
ter in avoidance is not sufficient. Rowland v. Windley, 82-131 ; Ward v.
Phillips, 89-215; Move v. Petway, 76-327; Walker v. Scott, 106-56.
Judgment not a contract. —A judgment is not a contract. Distinction
between them discussed. McDonald v. Dickson, 87-404.
Form of Judgment. —An alternative judgment is bad. Mitchell v. Hen
derson, 63-643; Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273; State v. Perkins, 82-682.
Judgment on a gold contract can only be given by reducing the gold
value to currency, and giving judgment for that amount of money. Gar
rett v. Smith, 64-93; Brown v. Foust, 64-672 ; Gibson v. Grover, 63-10;
Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
Under The Code, the courts having jurisdiction of legal and equitable
rights; are required to frame their judgments so as to determine all the
rights of the parties. Lea v. Pearce, 6S-76; Hutchinson v. Smith, 68-354.
Judgments upon bonds of guardians, administrators, etc., should be
for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged upon payment of the
amount of damages assessed, with interest, when it is allowed, from the
first day of the term at which the judgment was rendered. Anthony v.
Estes, .101-541.
Foreign judgments.—By virtue of the Constitution of the United States,
and acts of congress in pursuance thereof, the judgments of other states are put upon the same footing as domestic judgments. They are con
clusive of all questions involved in them, except fraud in their procure
ment, and whether the parties were properly brought before the court.
Miller v. Leach, 95-229.
Judgment of judge of general jurisdiction. —// seems, that the judgment
of the superior court, presided over by a judge of general jurisdiction,
though not the judge designated by the constitution, is not null and
void. State v. Speaks, 95-689.
Judgment against plaintiff for costs. —A plaintiff cannot abandon the
averments of his complaint, and fall back upon a collateral statement
of facts set out in the answer. The proper course is to ask leave to
amend the complaint, and thereby present the point of law desired. So
that, where the complaint does not show a cause of action, although the
defendant does not take advantage of it by demurrer or motion to dis
miss, the court, upon its appearing, will direct a judgment to be entered
that the defendant go without day and recover costs. Rand v. Bank,
77-152.
Action to recover real property. —Damages, up to the time of trial, are
recoverable in an action of ejectment. Whissenhunt v. Jones, 78-361.
If the jury find that the plaintiff is entitled to the land, but do not find
any wrongful act done to it by the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover
damages or costs. Clarke v. Wagner, 78-367..
In the former practice as to ejectment possession was recovered with
out affecting the right of property. Under the C C P., the judgment
is conclusive. Cowles v. Ferguson, 90-308.
If the plaintiff in an action of ejectment, gets possession of the land
before judgment, if he recover, he is not entitled to a judgment that he
recover the possession, but only to one declaring the validity of his
title. Woodley v. Hassell, 94-157.
A tenant is estopped to deny his landlord's title, but when the plain
tiff fails to show any title in himself, and relies entirely on the estop
pel, the judgment should only be that he recover the possession, and
the defendant should be left free to assert any title he may have in
another action. Benton v. Benton, 95-559.
Where the title to a tract of land has been passed upon in one action,
the losing party carnot reopen the question by a proceeding to have the
land processioned. Holley v. Holley, 96-229.
Under the former practice, in an action of ejectment or trespass, dam
ages were awarded only up to the time of bringing the action, but under
trie present system, they are recoverable up to the time of the trial.
Pearson v. Carr, 97-194.
Alternative judgment. —Alternative judgments are not allowed either in
civil or criminal cases, hence it is error to sentence a party to "pay a
fine of $40, and in default thereof to be imprisoned thirty days." Inre
Deaton, 105-59; Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273; Strickland v. Cox, 102-41 1;
State v. Perkins, 82-681.
Against president of a corporation.—A judgment against one as president
of a corporation does not affect the property of the corporation. David
son v. Alexander, 84-621.
Judgment may be modified during term. —The court bas power, during the
term, to correct or modify an unexecuted judgment in criminal as well
as in civil actions State v. Brittain, 93-587 ; State v. Manly, 95-661.
Amendment to interlocutory judgmant out of term.—It seems, that the
superior courts have power to make an amendment to an interlocutory
order in an ancillary proceeding out of term. If appellant does not
except to the making of such order at the time, he will be taken to have
assented to it. Coates v. Wilkes, 94-174.
Contempt to violate interlocutory judgment.—A party who intentionallv*
violates an interlocutory judgment of the court is guilty of contempt,
although he may have acted in good faith upon professional advice
honestly given. Green v. Griffin, 95-50.
Vacation or modification of interlocutory decrees and orders. —An interlocu
tory decree may be modified or rescinded during the pendency of the
suit, upon sufficient grounds shown to meet the justice and equity of the
case. Worth v. Gray, 59-4; Ashe v. Moore, 6-483; Shinn v. Smith,
64-93; Miller v. Justice, 86-26; Welch v Kinsland, 89-179.
Interlocutory orders are under the control of the court, and, upon good
cause shown, they can be amended, modified, changed or rescinded, as
the court may think proper. Maxwell v. Blair, 95-317.
The recitals in a final judgment cannot change the force and effect of
an order made in a previous stage of the action. Jackson v. McLean,
96-474Note. —For former practice, see Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 791-802.
Judgment an estoppel. —Under the present system, a judgment in an
action to recover land is as complete an estoppel as in any other action.
Johnson v. Pate, 90-334; Benton v. Benton, 95-559; Allen v. Sallinger,
103-14; Cowles v. Ferguson, 90-305.
A question once judicially determined cannot again be raised and
tried between same parties in a different form. Warden v. McKinnon,
99-251; Williams v. Batchelor, 90-364.
The plaintiff brought an action before a justice of the peace to recover
balance, less than $200, due upon a note given in purchase of land. The
defendant answered, alleging that there was a failure of consideration,
growing out of plaintiff's fraudulent representations in respect of the
title, and demanded judgment that the action be dismissed because the
title to real estate was involved. Upon the proofs, the justice refused to
dismiss, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff, from which defendant
appealed, and in the superior court the judgment was reversed aud
action dismissed. Therenpon, plaintiff brought his action for same
relief in superior court: Held, that, notwithstanding the judgment dis
missing the action may have been erroneous, it was res judicata'; that
the defendant was estopped thereby from alleging a want ofjurisdiction
in the superior court, and that, under \ 838 of The Code, the superior
court had jurisdiction of the cause. Peck v. Culberson, 104-425.
The judgment concludes the parties as to all matters which were
pleaded, or should have been, in the first action. Davie v. Davis, 108501; Williams v. Clouse, 91-322.
A judgment that "plaintiffs are permitted to withdraw their action
or special proceeding because the same was prematurely begun, and
leave is given the defendants to withdraw their counterclaim," cannot
be pleaded as estoppel as between the parties thereto in another action
between the same. Such judgment is no final determination of the con
troversy. Stewart v. Register, 108-588.
See \ 424, post.
When a judgment will cure the absence of a complaint. —A judgment is not
void because no complaint has been filed. Little v. McCarter, 89-233;
Leach v. Railroad, 65-486; Vick v. Pope, 81-22; Robeson v. Hodges.
Judgment cannot be attacked collaterally. —The judgments and decrees of
a court which has jurisdiction, although erroneous or irregular,«caunot
be attacked in a collateral proceeding. If erroneous, they must be cor
rected by appeal. If irregular, they must be set aside by a motion in
the cause, made in a reasonable time. Ward v. Lowndes, 96-367.
When, in a former action, it was agreed in writing at spring term,
1882, that plaintiff might take a nonsuit and enter the same in vacation,
and at spring term, 1883, a nonsuit was entered without objection, nunc
pro tunc, as of fall term, 1882, the defendant cannot, in the present
action, brought to spring term, 1883, impeach the order collaterally and
avail himself of the pendency of the former action as a defence. Wil
son v. Pearson, 102-290.
Irregular judgments. — It is well settled, that a motion in the cause, and
not a new action, is the proper remedy to set aside an irregular judg
ment, whether the irregularity appears on the face of the record or not,
even although the action is at an end. It is otherwise when it is sought
to attack a judgment for fraud, which must be done by a new action, if
the action in which the judgment sought to be attacked is at an end.
Syme v. Trice, 96-243 ; White v. Morris, 96-91.
See numerous cases cited on this point under \ 274, ante.
Too late to object to judgment.—Where an adult was served with process
in a cause, but filed no answer, and made no objection to any of the
ordeis or decrees until three and a half years after they were passed,
and then showed no injury to have resulted to her from the decrees :
It was held, that they would not be set aside at her instance. Syme v.
Trice, 96-243.
Action to set aside judgment for fraud. —Where it is sought to attack a
judgment for fraud, if the action is not determined, it must be done by
a petition in the action, but if the action has been determined, it must
be done by an independent.action. Burgess v. Kirby, 94-575.
// seems, that parties to a decree, who accept benefits under it, cannot
afterwards attack it, except for fraud. Slaughter v. Cannon, 94-189.
See \ 274, ante.
Motion to enter payment of judgment.—Where there was evidence that
two of the plaintiffs had been paid by defendant before the judgment
was rendered, and that the third had been paid since, it was proper to
set the judgment aside as to the former, but not as to the latter. .As to
the latter, the proper course was to move to have satisfaction of the
judgment entered on the record, which the court could do on proof of
payment. Peoples v. Norwood, 94-167.
Rights of third parties, if judgment reversed. —Although a judgment may
afterwards be reversed, the rights of third persons honestly acquired
therennder will be protected ; but otherwise, where such persons have
knowledge of any irregularity or fraud in procuring its rendition. Mor
ris v. Gentry, 89-248.
Sec. 385. Judgment bu default final, in what cases. C. C.
P., ». 217. 1870-'1, c. 42.
Judgment by default final may be had on failure of
defendant to answer, as follows :
(1) Where complaint sets forth one or more causes of
action, each consisting of the breach of an express or
implied contract to pay, absolutely or upon a contingency,
a sum or sums of money fixed by the terms of the con
tract, or capable of being ascertained therefrom by compu
tation. Upon proof of personal service of summons, or of
service of summons by publication, on one or more of the
defendants, and upon the complaint being verified, judg
ment shall be entered at the return term for the amount
mentioned in the complaint, against the defendant or
defendants, or against one or more of several defendants,
in the cases provided in section two hundred and twentytwo.
(2) Where the defendant, by his answer in such action,
shall not deny the plaintiff's claim, but shall set up a coun
terclaim amounting to less than the plaintiff's claim, judg
ment may be had by the plaintiff for the excess of said
claim over the said counterclaim, in like manner in any
such action, upon the plaintiff's filing with the court a
statement admittiug such counterclaim, which statement
shall be annexed to and be a part of the judgment-roll.
(3) In actions where the service of the summons was by
publication, the plaintiff may, in like manner, apply for
judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to
be made of the demand mentioned in the complaint, and if
the defendant be not a resident of the state, must require
the plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath respect
ing any payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or
to anyone for his use on account of such demand, and may
render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to
recover. Before rendering judgment the court may, in its
discretion, require the plaintiff to cause to be filed satisfac
tory security, to abide the order of the court, touching the
restitution of any estate or effects which may be directed
by such judgment to be transferred or delivered, or the res
titution of any money that may be collected under and by
virtue of said judgment, in case the defendant or his repre
sentatives shall apply and be admitted to defend the action,
and shall succeed in such defence.
Notice. —The five days' notice required is not now necessary upon a
motion made in term time, as the parties, through their counsel, must
take notice, at their peril, of all motions and steps in the cause at any
term when the same is triable. Clayton v. Jones, 68-497 ; University v.
Lassiter, 83-38.
Presumption of notice of a motion does not apply to proceedings in
the probate court. Blue v. Blue, 79-69.
A defendant, served with summons in the action, is fixed with notice
of a judgment by default taken therein. McDaniel v. Watkins, 76-399.
Presumed to be correct. —Verdicts and judgments are presumed to be
correct until the contrary be shown. State v. Lanier, 89-517 ; Morris v.
Gentry, 89-248.
Failure to take judgment by default.—A failure to take a judgment by
default as soon as it is allowable, does not work a discontinuance. Uni
versity v. Lassiter, 83-38.
Judgment by default final, regular.—A judgment by default final in an
action for money only, is regular when the defendant has accepted ser
vice and failed to answer. Walton v. Walton, 80-26.
Judgment final may be rendered in an action for the recovery of money
where a specific sum is contracted to be paid, where the complaint is
sworn to and no answer filed. Rogers v. Moore, 86-85; Wynne v.
Prairie, 86-73.
Where the action is for a sum certain which the defendant had prom
ised to pay for goods sold and delivered, and the complaint is sworn to,
a judgment by default final can be taken where a frivolous demurrer is
filed. Adrian v. Jackson, 75-536.
A judgment by default final cannot be rendered unle*s the complaint
is verified. Witt v. Long, 93-388 ; Hammerslaugh v. Farrior, 95-135.
Where the complaint alleges that the plaintiff sold to the defendant
certain goods, wares and merchandise, for which he promised to pay a
sum certain, and the complaint is verified, the plaintiff is entitled to a
judgment by default final upon a failure to answer, or upon the filing of
an unverified answer. H'artman v. Farrior, 95-177.
See j! 531, and cases there cited.
Judgment by default final, irregular.—In an action sounding in damages
for an unliquidated money demand, a judgment by default final is irreg
ular, and on motion will be set aside. Moore v. Mitchell, 61-304
A judgment by default final for want of answer in a suit upon a bailbond cannot be sustained. It should have been a judgment by default and
inquiry, and the damages assessed by a jury. Roulhac v. Miller, 90-174.
A judgment by default for want of an answer against an additional
party brought in during progress of the action and against whom no
complaint is filed, is irregular and may be set aside at any time. Vass
v. Building Association, 91-55.
Where the judge left the court before the end of the time limited, but
did not adjourn the court, leaving it to expire by its own limitation, and
a judgment by default was entered against a defendant who filed an
answer before the expiration of such time, but after the departure of the
judge, the judgment should be set aside. Foley v. Blank, 92-476.

A judgment by default final is irregular in an action on an open
account for goods sold and delivered, where there is no express contract
alleged in the complaint, but the plaintiffs only seek to recover on the
implied contract the reasonable value of their goods. In such case the
judgment should be by default and inquiry. Witt v. Xong, 93-3SS.
Where it appeared, upon inspection of the record, that the amount
of the final judgment rendered on default of answer could not be ascer
tained by computation or be fixed by the terms of the contract sued on,
such judgment was irregular and should have been set aside by the
court, even though the demand for it was not based on that ground.
The overruling of a frivolous demurrer in such case leaves the parties
just as if it had not been filed. Skinner v. Terry, 107-103.
Waiver of jury. —Although the defendant has the right to have a jury
pass upon an issue, whether the debt sued for was incurred for the pur
chase of the homestead (The Code, j! 235), by failing to answer he waives
that right. Durham v. Wilson, 104-595.
Specialty sufficient complaint, if not objected to. —Filing the specialty is a
sufficient complaint, if objection is not taken before judgment. Vick v.
Pope, 81-22; Leach v. Railroad, 65-486.
Proof need not be made before the clerk. — By the act suspending The Code,
a judgment by default rendered by the superior court in term time on a
former judgment is regular, without proof being made before the clerk.
Mabry v. Erwin, 78-45.
Judgment against administrator qualified prior to July, 1869. —A judgment
by default against an administrator appointed prior to July, 1869, ren
dered in an action begun in 1882, conclusively fixes him with assets, not
withstanding the complaint upon which the judgment was based failed
to allege that he was possessed of assets. Brown v. McKee, 108-387.
Sec. S8(i. In all other actions upon failure to answer, judg
ment by default and inquiry.
In all other actions, except those mentioned in the pre
ceding section, when the defendant shall fail to answer, and
upon a like proof, judgment by default and inquiry may be
had at the return term, and inquiry shall be executed at
the next succeeding term. If the taking of an intricate or
long account be necessary to execute properly the inquiry,
the court, at the return term, may order the account to be
taken by the clerk of the court, or some other fit person,
and the referee shall make his report at the next succeed
ing term. In all other cases the inquiry shall be executed
by a jury, unless, by consent, the court is to try the facts
as well as the law.
Judgment by default and inquiry, when. —Upon a default in an action
which sounds in damages, the judgment is necessarily interlocutory.
Hartsfield v. Jones, 49-309.
Defendants in possession of real estate, in an action for its recovery,
who do not file bond before answering, as provided by acts of i869-'7o,
ch. 195, may have judgment entered against them by default, and dam
ages ascertained by reference or otherwise. Harkey v. Houston, 65-137.
In an action for goods sold or services rendered, or the like, even
though the complaint be verified and no answer filed, the judgment is
by default and inquiry, as under the practice prior to the C. C. P.
Rogers v. Moore, 86-35; Wynne v. Prairie, 86-73.
Where the complaint only alleges the value of the goods sold, without
also alleging a promise to pay, or where the complaint is not verified,
upon a failure to answer, the judgment should be by default and inquiry.
Hartman v. Farrior, 95-177.
Where the amount of the judgment could not be fixed by computation,
or be fixed by the terms of the contract sued on, the judgment by default
final is irregular and should be amended into a judgment by default and
inquiry. Skinner v. Terry, 107-103,
See cases cited under preceding section. For practice under former
system, see Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 791-794, sparsim.
Effect of judgment by default and inquiry. —A judgment by default and
inquiry admits the cause of action and plaintiffs are entitled to nominal
damages without introducing any proof. But in' seeking substantial
damages they must prove the delivery of each article, and the value
thereof. Parker v. Smith, 64-291.
Qmcre, how are judgments by default, now allowed by law, and the
amounts thereof ascertained. Is it in the manner prescribed in 2 385,
ante, or is it by the old mode of a jury and a writ of inquiry ? Sutton
v. McMillan, 72-102.
default in a suit for
goods sold and delivered, evidence in bar of the action is not compe
tent. The cause of action is adjudicated by the judgment of default,
and the plaintiff is only required to make proof of the delivery and
value of the goods. Lee v. Knapp, 90-171.
A judgment by default and inquiry is conclusive as to the plaintiff's
right to recover something upon his assigned cause of action, but it
leaves open the question of the amount to which he may be entitled;
and upon that issue the onus is upon him. Anthony v. Estes, 101-541.
After a judgment by default an inquiry in an action for malicious
prosecution the only issue for the jury is the amount of plaintiff's
damages. Banks v. Manufacturing Co., 108-282.
After a judgment by default on a constable's bond, the plaintiff must
prove the loss sustained by reason of the defendant's negligence, in all
particulars, in order that the damages resulting therefrom may be
assessed. Parker v. House, 66-374.
Assessed by the court, a referee, or a jury. —If the demand for judgment
in the complaint is for unliquidated damages, and judgment by default
is taken for a sum certain, it is irregular. The damages should be first
ascertained, either by the court, a referee, or a jury. Oates v. Gray,
66-442 ; White v. Snow, 71-232.
The court may either pass upon the facts or refer them to a referee or
a jury. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
In an action on contract for the recovery of money only, the clerk,
upon failure of defendant to answer in the specified time, shall enter up
for the amount specified in the complaint, if the complaint be verified
by oath ; and where it is for the specific property with damages for
the withholding, a jury may be called in to ascertain the damages.
Price v. Cox, 83-261.
Failure to take judgment by default.—A failure to take judgment by
default does not work a discontinuance. University v. Lassiter, 83-38.
Sec. 387. Judgment against infants in certain cases vali
dated. 187U, c 257. 1880, c. 23.
In any and all civil actions and special proceedings pend
ing on the fourteenth day of March, one thousand eight
hundred and seventy-nine, or theretofore determined, in
any of the courts, wherein any or all of the defendants
were infants, idiots, lunatics or persons non compos mentis,
on whom there was no personal service of the summons,
the proceedings, actions, decrees and judgments taken,
had and made by such courts in such civil actions and
special proceedings shall be valid, effectual and binding
against and upon such infants, idiots, lunatics and persons
non compos mentis, and their rights and estates in like man
ner, as if they had been personally served with a summons
therein : Provided, that this section shall not have the
effect, nor be construed, to prevent any of the proceed
ings, actions, judgments or decrees hereby rendered regu
lar and confirmed, from being impeached and set aside for
fraud.
Validity of this section. —The validity of this section recognized.
Howerton v. Sexton, 90-581.
It does not apply, when. —Where proceedings were irregular and void,
because process was not served upon the husband of the feme defendant,
and for other irregularities, this statute does not validate it as to her,
and the court will not construe it as validating the proceedings as against
infant co-defendants when not valid against the adult defendants. Gully
v. Macy, 86-721.
This section does not embrace a case where there has been no service
at all, but was intended to cover the case where personal service was
omitted as to infants, idiots, etc., but was had upon some one who
apparently had a right to represent them. Stancill v. Gay, 92-462; Perry
v. Adams, 98-167.
This section does not cure want of service as to infants, unless they
were represented in some proper manner. Harrison v. Harrison, 106-282.
It applies to what cases. —Where a petition to sell lands for assets was
filed, and service made on the infant defendants, but no guardian ad
litem was appointed until after the order of sale, when one was appointed
who was represented by the attorney of the plaintiff, who was also the
purchaser of the land, and came in and consented to the order of sale,
the irregularity was not such as rendered the judgment void and was
•cured by the statute. Fowler v. Poor, 93-466, and cases there cited.
// seems, that under the provisions of this section, decrees against
infants who were not served with process are binding, except where
fraud enters into and vitiates them. Hare v. Hollomon, 94-14.
Where an administrator filed a petition to make assets, and the heir
at law, an infant under fourteen years old, accepted service of the sum
mons, and a guardian ad litem was appointed and filed answer, but no
actual service was ever made, the irregularity was cured by this section.
Cates v. Pickett, 97-21.
Judicial proceedings under which a sale is made cannot be collaterally
assailed for irregularity. Those in this case seem to be cured by this
section. McGlawhorn v. Worthington, 98-199.
The failure of personal service on an infant is cured by the act of
1879 (The Code, §387). White v. Morris, 107-92.
Judgment not set aside, independent of this section.—Where an infant was
duly served with process and a guardian ad litem appointed, but no
process was served on the guardian, who made no defence, and it only
inferentially appeared that he knew of the pendency of the action, but
it did not appear that the infant had any defence and adults sued in the
same action, with identical interests, made no defence : Held, that the
judgment was not so irregular that it would be set aside on an applica
tion made several years thereafter. Williamson v. Hartman, 92-236.
The court will not set aside an irregular judgment against an infant as
of course, and it will not do so, when it appears from the record or other
wise, that the infant suffered no substantial wrong, and the rights of
third parties, without notice, have intervened. Syme v. Trice, 96-243.
In an action for the recovery of the possession of land, defendant, in
support of his title, offered in evidence a special proceeding and order
for sale of land for assets and deed therennder, to which plaintiff objected
because it did not appear that the guardian ad litem, appointed for the
feme plaintiff, when a party defendant in the proceeding, was served with
Summons was served upon
the infant according to law: Held, there whs not such irregularities as
made the proceeding void. At most, such proceedings were only void
able, and could not be attacked collaterally, except for fraud or by
motion in the cause when made in apt time. Coffin v. Cook, 106-376.
See \\ 181 and 274, ante, and cases there cited.
Sec. 388. Judgment on frivolous demurrer, answer or
reply. C. C. P., ». 218. 1870-'1, c. 42.
If a demurrer, answer or reply be frivolous, the party
prejudiced thereby may apply to the court, or to the judge
thereof, for judgment thereon, and judgment may be given
accordingly.
Notice. —The five days' notice is now dispensed with, since the motion
must be made in term time. Clayton v. Jones, 68-497; University v.
Lassiter, 83-38.
An answer will not be held frivolous, unless palpably so.—The court will not
readily decide an answer to be frivolous which is intended to raise a serious
question. Erwin v. Lowery, 64-231; Swepson v. Harvey, 66-436; Bank
v. Charlotte, 75-45 ; Womble v. Fraps, 77-198 ; Hull v. Carter, 83-249 ;
Boone v. Hardie, 83-470.
An answer which raises a material issue, even though evasive and not
fully responsive to the allegations of the complaint, is not frivolous.
Buie v. Brown, 104-335.
Frivolous answer.—A frivolous answer is one which is manifestly imper
tinent, alleging matters which do not affect the plaintiff's right to
recover. Flack v. Dawson, 69-42 ; Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467 ; Schehan
v. Malone, 71-440; Com'rs v. Piercy, 72-181; Dail v. Harper, 83-4;
Brogden v. Henry, 83-274.
An answer to a petition for partition of land, which alleges that the
boundaries as set out in the complaint in this case are not sufficient to
locate the land, and that therefore no title passed by the deed to the
petitioners as tenants in common, is frivolous, and will be disregarded.
Atkinson v. Mclntire, 90-147.
In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendants in their answer
admitted the execution of the note and mortgage, and the amount due
thereon, but alleged as a defence—(1) that the land had been sold under
judgments docketed prior to the execution of the mortgage, and that
they had acquired a life-estate in the land from the purchaser at execu
tion sale; (2) that the defendants own no other real estate from which
they can get a homestead; (3) that when the mortgage was executed,
they delivered to the mortgagee other securities as additional security
for the debt: Held, that the answer raises no material issue, either of
law or fact, and is frivolous. Weil v. Uzzell, 92-515.
Frivolous demurrer. —A demurrer which raises no serious question of
law, is frivolous. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273; Johnston v. Pate, 83-110;
Hurst v. Addington, 84-143.
If demurrer is held frivolous. — When a demurrer is stricken out as frivo
lous, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. Cowan v. Baird, 77-201. But
not to a judgment by default final, unless the sum is certain and com
plaint verified. White v. Morris, 107-92.
It rests in the sound discretiou of the court whether the defendant
shall be permitted to answer over (J 272). Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273.
Judgment non obstante veredicto. —Where the answer admits the cause of
action and the matter relied on in avoidance is insufficient, judgment
should be given in favor of plaintiff non obstante veredicto. Rowland
v. Windley, 82-131; Ward v. Phillips, 89-215; Walker v. Scott, 106-56.
Issue raised not affecting jurisdiction.—When there is an issue, whether the
debt is for purchase of homestead, it does not raise such a controversyinvolving title to real estate as divests the jurisdiction of a justice of
the peace. Durham v. Wilson, 104-595.
Motion for judgment during trial.—A motion to nonsuit a plaintiff in the
midst of a trial, on the ground that his evidence does not make out a
case—the defendant's counsel at the time stating that "if his Honor
should overrule the motion, he had evidence to offer, showing title in
himself," is an unfair and loose mode of practice, and should not be
tolerated. Stith v. Lookabill, 71-25; Crawley v. Woodfin, 78-4.
Motion for judgment upon complaint and answer.—It is irregular for the
plaintiff to move for judgment upon complaint and answer. If he admits
the allegations of the answer, his proper course is to demur. Baldwin
v. York, 71-463 ; Chastaiu v. Martin, 81-51.
See 'i 247, ante, and cases cited thereunder.
Sec. 380. This chapter applicable to courts of Justices of the
peace.
This chapter shall apply, as near as may be, to proceed
ings in courts of justices of the peace.
Procedure before justices of the peace. —If the plaintiff has not filed a veri
fied complaint, he cannot be forced to incur the expense of summoning
a jury, but at the most, the justice can only refuse to enter a judgment
by default, and compel him to prove his allegations, oral or written, as
to the indebtedness. Durham v. Wilson, 104-595.
Sec. .'{90. In actions to recover real property or the posses
sion thereof. 1809-' 70, c. 193, s. 4.
In all actions in the superior court for the recovery of
real property, or for the possession thereof, upon failure of
the defendant to file the undertaking required by section
two hundred and thirty-seven, or upon failure of sureties
to justify as provided in section five hundred and sixty,
the plaintiff shall have judgment for the relief demanded
in the complaint, unless the defendant is excused from giv
ing said undertaking before answering.
Bond is for damages as well as costs, and may be increased by order of the
court.—The bond required of defendants is not for costs only, but secures
the plaintiff such damages as he may sustain in the loss of rents; and
seniole, that the bond may be increased in the discretion of the court, if
the defendant shows any disposition to delay a trial. Rollins v. Henry,
77-467.
Summary judgment against sureties. —Upon judgment being rendered
against the defendant in an action to recover land, a summary judgment
can be entered up against the sureties on his bond. Rollins v. Henry,
84-569.
Defendants in forma pauperis.—In an action for recovery of land, where
the defendant filed his affidavit, alleging his inability to give the bond
required by 8 237, and counsel certified that the plaintiff was not entitled
to recover, it is error to require the defendant to give bond before being
allowed to defend the action. Jones v. Fortune, 60-322.
If the defendant is allowed to defend in forma pauperis, this does not
exempt him from paying costs if judgment be rendered against him, nor
prevent him from recovering cost. Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348; Justice
v. Eddings, 75-581.
See I 237, ante, and cases there cited.
See. 391. Issues defined ; different Winds of issues. C. CP.,
s. 219.
Issues arise upon the pleadings when a material fact or
conclusion of law is maintained by the one party and con
troverted by the other. They are of two kinds—
(1) Of law; and
(2) Of fact.
Issues of fact and questions of fact. —" Issues of fact " are such matters
of fact as are put in issue by the pleadings, and a decision of which
would be final, and conclude the parties upon the matters in controversy.
Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612 ; Armfield v. Brown, 70-27 ; Klutts v. McKenzie, 65-102. Patton v. Railroad, 96-455.
Distinguished from questions of fact, which arise incidentally upon
motions and exceptions. Foushee v. Pattershall, 67-453; Clegg v.
White Soapstone Co., 66-391 ; Keener v. Finger, 70-35.
Upon the pleadings. —The issues arise upon the pleadings. Fortescue v.
Crawford, 105-29; Wright v. Cain, 93-296; Patton v. Railroad, 96-455.
Note.—See the dissenting opinion of Rodman, J., in Green v. Castleberry, 70-20, and Keener v. Finger, 70-35. So much of the discussion
therein, however, as refers to the jurisdiction of the supreme court to
review issues of fact has become immaterial by the amendment to the
constitution.
Defective issues. —If the issues framed by the court are defective or
insufficient to develop the whole case, the party prejudiced thereby
must lay the foundation for an appeal, by suggesting the proper correc
tions at the time. Moore v. Hill, 85-218.
A party who neglects to tender such issues as he deems essential to
develop his case, can not assign as error on appeal the failure of the court
to submit such issues. Alexander v. Robinson, 85-275.
Alternative propositions are objectionable as issues. Coble v. Coble,
82-339See H 395 and 409, post, and cases cited.
Quaere. —The legislature has given to no court exclusive equitable
jurisdiction, and whether this court has power to prescribe such a juris
diction in pursuance of article 4 J 8 of the constitution, conferring
jurisdiction over " issues of fact,"—quccre. Wessell v. Rathjohn, 89-377.
Rules of supreme court adopted June term, 1871. —These rules are con
strued. School Committee v. Kesler, 66-323.
Sec. 392. Issue of law. C. C. P., s. 220.
An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to to the com
plaint, answer or reply, or to some part thereof.
Raised only by demurrer. —An issue of law can be raised only by demur
rer. Andrews v. Pritchett, 66-3S7.
Postponement till vacation. —Parties rhay, by consent, postpone a trial of
issues of law till vacation. Harrell v. Peebles, 79-26.
Decision on issue of law.—When a demurrer is filed, it is the duty of the
judge to decide the issues of law raised thereby, and the entry, " judg
ment proconfesso," will be treated as an idle expression, and stricken
from the record. Gibson v. Smith, 65-103.
Sec. 393, Issue of fact. C. C. P., s. 221.
An issue of fact arises—
(1) Upon a material allegation in the complaint contro
verted by the answer ; or,
Must be raised by the pleadings. —The issues are raised by the pleadings,
and it is not error to refuse to submit an issue not made by them.
McHlwee v. Blackwell, 82-415 ; Miller v. Miller, 89-209.
What are proper issues. —It is not every matter averred on one side and
denied on the other that in a legal sense is an issue, but only such as are
necessary to dispose of the controversy. Cedar Falls Co. v. Wallace,
83-225 ; Cuthbertson v. Insurance Co., 96-480.
In an actiou for goods sold and delivered, where there is an answer
denying sale and also setting up a compromise, an issue may be sub
mitted to the jury as to the validity of the debt unaffected by the com
promise. Fickey v. Merrimon, 70-585.
In an action for the specific recovery of a chattel, it is proper to sub
mit an issue ascertaining the value of the chattel at the time the plain
tiff sold it to the defendant. Wilson v. Hughes, 94-182.
In an action on a policy of insurance wherein several distinct articles
are insured, it is not proper to submit separate issues as to the value of
each separate article. Cuthbertson v. Insurance Co., 96-480.
In an action for damages for conversion of personal property the
issues are properly restricted to plaintiff 's title, the act of conversion and
amount of injury. Rhea v. Deaver, 85-337.
When, in an action of ejectment, it is alleged in the complaint "that
plaintiff was the owner" and "entitled to the possession" of the land
clark's code of civil procedure.
in controversy, and the defendant in his answer, denies each of these
allegations, and sets up new matter as a defence : Held, to be error to
refuse to submit the issues raised by the allegations of the complaint,
and to only submit those issues arising on the new matter set up in the
answer. Davidson v. Gifford, 100-18.
It is the duty of the court to submit to the jury every material issue
raised by the pleadings unless waived. Albright v. Mitchell, 70-445;
Gordon v. Collett, 104-381; Wilson v. Bynum, 92-273.
When issues of fact are raised by the pleadings, it is error to submit
only the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover ; that is a
question of law arising after verdict and addressed solely to the court.
Braswell v. Johnson, 108-150.
The only issues proper to be submited to the jury, are those matters
alleged on the one side and denied on the other, which are necessary to
determine the controversy, and every such issue ought to be either sub
mitted, or, under the instructions of the court, clearly embraced in some _
other issue which is submitted. Kirk v. Railroad, 97-82.
(2) Upon new matter in the answer, controverted by the
reply ; or,
Proper issues.—Where a material issue is raised by the answer, although
the matter is not alleged in the complaint, it is not error to submit an
issue on it. Shaw v. McNeill, 95-5.^5.
Where, to a suit on a note, the sole defence set up was that it was a
gambling debt, the only issue properly submitted was as to the illegal
consideration. Carrington v. Allen, 87-354.
If the defendant, in an action to recover laud, sets up the defence that
he is entitled to a homestead therein, such defence is embraced and
should be considered, under the issue raised as to the plaintiff's owner
ship and right to the possession of the land. Morrison v. Watson, 95-479.
In an action against a railroad for damages, the defendant tendered
the issues : (1) Were the plaintiff's injuries caused by the negligent run
ning of defendant's engine ? (2) Was there contributory negligence on
the part of the plaintiff? (3) What damages is the plaintiff entitled to
recover ? The court declined to submit these, and substituted instead a
single issue: What damages, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover?
Held, (1) to be error ; (2) the question of the quantum of damages is a
mere incidental one, depending upon the real issues of fact raised by
the pleadings. Denmark v. Railroad, 107-185.
When a material defence is pleaded, it is proper for the court to sub
mit an issue on it. Owens v. Phelps, 95-2S6.
If a party in an action to recover land sets up in his pleadings a demand
for compensation for improvements, he should have that question passed
on at the trial with the other issues ; he will not be permitted to raise it
thereafter, as the judgment rendered upon the trial will be deemed conclu
sive of all matters put in issue by the pleadings. Casey v. Cooper, 99-395.
Contributory negligence,—In an action for damages for an injury caused
by the negligence of the defendant, where the defence is contributory
negligence, it is sometimes proper to submit two issues, one as to the
negligence of the defendant, and the other as to the contributory negli
gence of the plaintiff, yet when the action of both has contributed to
the injury, it is allowable to submit an issue only as to the defendant's
negligence, with instructions to find that in the negative, if the jurybelieve that the plaintiff 's conduct contributed to the injury. Scott v.
Railroad, 96-428 ; Smith v. Railroad, 99-241.
In an action to recover damages for an injury caused by the negligence
of the defendant, who pleads contributory negligence on the part of the
plaintiff, the defendant is entitled to an issue on this question, unless
the court includes it under the issue as to negligence, by proper instruc
tions to the jury. Kirk v. Railroad, 97-82.
Though under ch. 33 of the acts of 1887, a defendant in an action for
damages, who relies on contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff,
must allege it in the answer, it is not error to fail to submit a special
issue, as to such contributory negligence, when there is an issue, whether '
plaintiff sustained injuries by the negligence of defendant, under which
the question might be considered ; certainly not when the defendant
declined to submit such issues when requested. De Berry v. Railroad,
100-310; McAdoo v. Railroad, 105-140.
The better practice is to submit an issue upon the question of con
tributory negligence. Denmark v. Railroad, 107-185.
(3) Upon new matter in the reply, except an issue of law
is joined thereon.
What issues should not be submitted. —Where, in an action to recover
land, the court submitted an issue to the jury under which the location
of a disputed line could be found by them, and refused to submit one
proposed by the defendant, as to whether the plaintiff agreed that a piocessioner might run and mark the line, and that the defendant might
take possession under said agreement : Held, no error, as it was not
material to the case and not raised by the pleadings. Overcash v. Kitchie,
89-384.
See \ 395. post.
Evidential fic^. —The only issues proper to be submitted to a jury are
those raised by the constitutive facts alleged on the one side and denied
on the other ; and those issues which are merely evidential, and when
found by the jury, only furnish facts which would be evidence to prove
the main issue, should never be submitted. Grant v. Bell, 87-34; Patton v. Railroad, 96-455.
Verdict on issues substantially the same an estoppel. —A judicial determina
tion of the issues in one action is a bar to a subsequent one betwetn the
same parties having the same object in view, although the form of the
latter and the precise relief sought therein is different from the former.
Edwards v. Baker, 99-258.
In special proceedings. —In a special proceeding, when a demurrer is
filed to a complaint, an issue of law is raised, which should be certified
to the judge at chambers ; but when an answer is filed which raises issues
of both law and fact, the entire case should be transferred to the civil
issue docket to be tried at the term. Jones v. Hemphill, 77-42 ; Brandon
v. Phelps, 77-44 ; McBryde v. Patterson, 73-478. See \ 255, ante.
Sec. 394. On issues of both law and fact, issue of law to be
tried first. C. C. P., 8. 222.
Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon different
parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases
the issues of law must be first tried, unless the court other
wise direct.
Issue of law, or settlement pleaded, disposed of first. — Where the statute
of limitations is pleaded, or a settlement in bar, it should be passed upon
as a preliminary question before a trial by referee or otherwise on the
merits. Cox v. Cox, 84-139; Com'rs v. Magnin, 85-114 ; Sloan v. McMahon, 85-296 ; Neal v. Becknall, 85-299 ; Railroad v. Morrison, 82-141 ;
Douglas v. Caldwell, 64-372; Com'rs v. Raleigh, 88-120. This course
was pursued in Barbam v. Lomax, 73-76, but without adjudication on
the point.
In an action for an account, if the defendant pleads final settlement,
it is the duty of the court to have this issue determined before ordering
a reference for account. Quarles v. Jenkins, 98-258.
A plea in bar of an action for an account must be determined before
ordering a reference, notwithstanding there may be other matters alleged
in the pleadings arising subsequently to the matter pleaded in bar, as to
which account may be necessary. Bridgers v. Bridgers, 101-71.
Though a party has the right to demand that his plea in bar shall be
passed upon before a reference of the action, otherwise requiring a ref
erence, he waives the right by not insisting upon it before reference
ordered. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
Where the facts upon which a plea in bar is based are admitted in the
pleadings, it is the duty of the judge to determine the question of law
raised, and if he refuses to pass upon the plea in bar, but orders a refer
ence to state an account, such refusal is a denial of a right, and in effect
an adverse ruling upon the plea, which is open to correction on appeal
to this court. Woody v. Brooks, 102-334.
Sec. 39!i. When and by whom issues to he made up.
The issues arising upon the pleadings, material to be
tried, shall be made up by the attorneys appearing in the
action, and reduced to writing, or by the judge presiding,
before or during the trial.
Issues should be made up before the trial. —By the common law the par
ties made up the issue by their pleadings. The Code adopts the equity
procedure, when the issues are not eliminated by the proceedings, but
must be made by the court. The consumption of time in wrangling
over the issues is a serious inconvenience, to remedy which the rules of
the supreme court upon the subject were adopted. The only alteration
intended to be made hy these was to have the issues made up before
hand, and no appeal lies from a ruling of the judge in regard to them,
any more than on the admissibility of testimony. School Committee v.
Kesler, 66-323.
Duty of court. —If the issues are not prepared by the attorneys, it is
the duty of the judge who tries the case to do so. Bowen v. Whitaker,
92-367.
Where issues are raised by the pleadings, it is the duty of the court
to eliminate and submit them to the jury, and when this is not done,
the supreme court will refuse to take cognizance of the cause upon such
imperfect record, unless the issues in nowise affect the errors assigned.
Fisher v. Mining Co., 94-397.
It is the duty of the court to see that all material controverted mat
ters contained in the pleadings are eliminated and submitted to the jury
in the form of issues. McDonald v. Carson, 94-497.
Pleadings, how framed. —When the pleadings are so framed as to pre
sent the case of either party in more than one aspect, as to the evidence
that may be produced, the issues should not be so framed as to exclude
any pertinent evidence affecting the merits, but should be so shaped as
to embrace the whole of the material allegations controverted. This
may be insisted upon, as of right, by either party tothe^ction. David
son v. Gifford, 100-18.
Ordinarily it must be left to the sound discretion of the court whether
to submit specific issues so that the finding will be in the nature of a
special verdict or confine the inquiry to one or a small number of issues,
provided that the issues are those raised by the pleadings. Emry v.
Railroad, 102-209.
In framing issues for the jury, it has been settled, (1) that only issues
of fact raised by the pleading must be submitted to the jury; (2) that
the verdict, whether upon one or many issues, must establish facts suffi
cient to enable the court to proceed to judgment ; (3) of the issues
raised by the pleadings, the judge who tries the case may, in his discre
tion, submit one or many, provided that neither party is denied the
opportunity to present to the jury any view of the law arising out of the
evidence through the medium of pertinent instructions on some issue
passed upon. McAdoo v. Railroad, 105-140; Denmark v. Railroad,
107-185.
The rules laid down for framing issues in Emry v. Railroad, 102-309,
and McAdoo v. Railroad, 105-140, discussed and approved. Braswell v.
Johnson, 108-150.
Issues must be tendered by counsel,—When a proper issue is not tendered
in the court below, it cannot be complained of, on an appeal, that the
court did not frame it. Kidder v. Mcllhenny, 81-123; Curtis v. Cash,
84-41; Bryant v. Fisher, 85-71; Walker v. Scott, 106-56; Alexander v.
Robinson, 85-275.
It is the duty of the party to an action to tender such issues before the
trial begins as he conceives are necessary to try the case upon the
merits ; and an exception made after the trial, that issues, which might
properly have been submitted, were not, comes too late. Simmons v.
Mann, 92-12; Oakley v. Van Noppen, 95-60; Silver Valley Co. v. Balti
more Co., 99-445 ; Pollock v. Warwick, 104-638.
Where a party to an action prepares issues which are submitted, and
then objects to another issue submitted by the court, he cannot be heard
to assign as error that the court did not submit an issue on a particular
question on which he did not ask an issue. McDonald v. Carson, 95-377.
Issues submitted without objection. —Where issues are submitted which
are not raised by the pleadings, without objection in the court below,
objection cannot be made to them for the first time in this court, and
the findings must stand. Porter v. Railroad, 97-66 ; Clements v. Rogers,
95-248 ; Wilson v. Hughes, 94-182.
Where at the commencement of the trial certain issues were agreed
upon by the parties to the action, but subsequently the court substituted
others without objection, after verdict an exception that such issues
were not properly submitted came too late. Phifer v. Alexander,
97-335; Moore v. Hill, 85-218.
If a party assent to the submission of an improper issue, he will not
be permitted to make it the ground of exception. Chemical Co. v.
Johnson, 101-223 I Carey v. Carey, 108-267.
What issues should be submitted. —When issues are made up by the plead
ings, parties have a right to have those material to the determination of
the case submitted to a jury; and for the presiding judge to withdraw
such material issues and substitute others in their place is error. Al
bright v. Mitchell, 70-445.
Not every matter averred on one side and denied on the other is an
issue to be submitted to the jury, but only such as are necessary to dis
pose of the controversy. Cedar Falls Co. v. Wallace, 83-225.
Only such issues as arise upon the pleadings should be submitted to
the jury, and it is the duty of the court to determine what they are. The
law and practice in reference to pleading and framing issues, discussed
by Merrimon, J. Miller v. Miller, 89-209.
Only such issues as are raised by the pleadings should be submitted to
the jury, and it is not error for the court to refuse to submit an issue
which the pleadings do not present. Wright v. Cain, 93-296.
Only issues arising naturally upon the pleadings should be submitted,
but where they are subdivided, this is not a ground for new trial, unless
it appear that they were thereby confusing, complicated or prejudicial.
Bean v. Railroad, 107-731.
What issues should not be submitted. — In a case involving complicated
accounts the parties are not entitled to have the facts passed upon by a
jury. Under the C. C. P., it is referred to a referee who gives his judg
ment upon both facts and law. Klutts v. McKensie, 65-103; Martin v.
Milbourn, 66-321.
It is not error to refuse to submit an issue to the jury when there is no
evidence to support it. Best v. Frederick, 84-176
Alternative issues should not be submitted. Coble v. Coble, 82-339.
The court should not submit to the jury such issues as are directed to
mere details of evidence. Grant v. Bell, 87-34; Patton v. Railroad, 96-455.
Nor issues 011 points not decisive of the case. Henry v. Rich, 64-379.
Where the supreme court has passed upon the effect of record and
documentary evidence in one appeal and remanded the case for a new
trial, it is not error for the trial judge to refuse to submit an issue to be
found only on such evidence, when it was declared by the court on
appeal to be insufficient for that purpose. McMillan v. Baker, 97-197.
Immaterial and irrelevant issues. —The submission to the jury of an irrel
evant or immaterial issue, when it cannot be seen how it prejudiced the
appellant, is not assignable as error. McDonald v. Carson, 94-497 ;
Cuthbertson v. Ins. Co., 96-480, Cumming v. Barber, 99-332.
Immaterial issues should never, and issues embracing incidental facts
should not ordinarily be submitted, and if a party is prejudiced thereby it
is ground for a new trial when excepted to in apt time. Willis v. Branch,
94-142 ; Home v. Bank, 108-109.
Issue not raised by pleadings. — It is erroneous to submit an issue to the jury
which is not raised by the pleadings. Willis v. Branch, 94-142 ; Carpen
ter v. Tucker, 98-316 ; Lewis v. Railroad, 95-179 ; McAbsher v. Railroad,
108-344.
If issue in language of pleadings. —It is sufficient if an issue is submitted
in the language of the pleading. If it is desired in another form, the
court should be asked to amend the pleadings so that it may arise in the
form desired. McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
Where the issues do not cover all the matters in controversy. —When the
issues submitted do not cover the whole merits of a case, the court will
retain the cause and send down other issues to be passed upon by the
jury in the court below. Allen v. Biker, 86-91.
AH the issues of law and fact should be tried and determined and the
case not settled bv piecemeal. Briggs v. Smith, 83-306; Kirby v. Mills,
Where no issue is evolved by the pleadings. —Where, upon an appeal the
contending allegations of the parties in the court below do not appear to
have evolved any issue, a venire de novo will be granted in order that
there may be a repleader. Brown v. Cooper, 85-477.
When no issue is submitted. — Where no issues were eliminated and sub
mitted, but the court below held that, upon the evidence the plaintiff
was not entitled to recover, and he took a nonsuit and appealed, the
failure to submit issues was not material. Fisher v. Mining Co., 94-397.
No issue is necessary when the facts are not disputed. Alderman v.
Rivenbark, 96-134.
It is again intimated that the supreme court will not entertain an
appeal where the transcript of the record fails to show that issues were
proposed and submitted as required by The Code. Tiddy v. Harris,
101-589.
Refusal of issues cured. —Though the issues tendered by a defendant
eliminated more distinctly the matters controverted in the pleadings
than those adopted by the court, he has n0 ground of complaint if the
instructions to the jury raised every defence available to him under those
he tendered. McDonald v. Carson, 95-377; Meredith v. Iron Co., 99-576.
When the verdict establishes facts sufficient to sustain the judgment,
and it appears that issues tendered by a party were refused, but the jury
were told by the judge how the testimony relating to the rejected issues
bore, in law, upon the issues submitted, a new trial will not be granted.
Emry v. Railroad, 102-209.
See H 391, 393, ante, and \ 409, post, and cases cited.
Sec.
Issues should be in concise and direct terms.
Rale 1F of Sup. Ct., June Term, 187 1.
Issues should be framed in concise and direct terms, and
prclixity and confusion must be avoided by not having too
many issues.
Directory. —The rule prescribed by the supreme court (80-495) for the
preparation of issues on the trial of causes is merely directory. Witkowski v. Watkins, 84-457; School Committee v. Kesler, 66-323.
Mandatory. —The provisions of The Code are mandatory that the con
troverted allegations in the pleadings should be submitted to the jury in
the shape of issues. Rudasill v. Falls, 92-222; Arnold v. Estes, 92-162;
Denmark v. Railroad, 107-185.
The requirements of the statute in regard to submitting distinct issues
in writing to the jury is mandatory, and where it does not appear from
the record what issues were submitted, but it is stated in general terms
that all the issues were found in favor of the plaintiff, a new trial will
be granted. Bowen v. Whitaker, 92-367.
The material issues of fact raised by the pleadings must be submitted,
unless it appears to the court that this right is waived by the parties.
Davidson v. Gifford, 100-18; Porter v. Railroad, 97-66.
Concise and direct. —Alternative propositions are objectionable as issues.
Coble v. Coble, 82-339.
Issues which embrace all the substantial matters of defence developed
in the pleading and necessary to a determination of the action are suf
ficient. Dupree v. Insurance Co., 92-417.
Where issues are framed in such a manner that the material facts of
the case as found by the jury are confused and unsatisfactory, the ver
dict should be set aside and a new trial ordered. Turrentine v. Railroad,
Issues are not required to be in any particular form, but they should
be so framed as to clearly present the controverted facts. Mace v. Life
Insurance Co., 101-122.
Two propositions in one issue. —It is misleading to embody in one issue
two propositions, to which different responses might be made. A new
trial will be granted if such an issue is submitted, exception being taken
thereto in apt time. Eniry v. Railroad, 103-209 ; Mfg. Co. v. Assurance
Co., 106-28.
Donble issues, —When the plea of insanity is set up, it is competent to
submit together the double issue as to sanity and on the merits, both
in civil and criminal cases. Smith v. Smith, 106-498 ; State v. Hay
wood, 94-847.
Contradictory issues.—Contradictory issues under the different aspects
of the pleadings are not objectionable under The Code system. Bean v.
Railroad, 107-731.
It is not error to submit an issue involving title, with one involving
fraud. Bonds v. Smith, 106-554.
Frame of issues largely left to discretion of judge. —The supreme court will
not interfere with the discretion of the trial judge in shaping and sub
mitting issues, if it appear that an opportunity is given the parties to
present their evidence and the law applicable thereon to the jury, and
they were raised by the pleadings. Cuthbertson v. Ins. Co., 96-480 ;
Lineberger v. Tidwell, 104-506.
The form and number of issues submitted must be determined by the
judge who tries the case, in the exercise of a sound discretion, except that
they must be such as that the court can proceed to enter judgment upon
the responses, and that the appellant shall lose no opportunity to
present to the court below, and, on appeal, to this court, any view of the
law applicable to the evidence. Boyer v. Teague, 106-576.
The frame of the issues is largely left to the discretion of the presid
ing judge, if they are such as arise upon the pleadings. Eniry v. Rail
road, 102-209 1 Brown v. Mitchell, 102-347 ; Everett v. Williamson,
107-204.
Issues sufficient. —When the issues raised by the pleadings are compre
hensive enough to allow the introduction of all the evidence material to
the case, there is no ground of exception. Leach v. Linde, 108-547.
See U 393 and 395, ante.
Sec. 397. Trial defined. C. C. P., s. 223.
A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between
the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact.
All material issues should be tried. —It is error not to try all the material
issues raised by the pleadings, unless they are waived. Gordon v. Collett, 102-532.
Trial upon allegations in pleadings.—It is required of parties to actions
to set forth in their pleadings their causes of action or matters of
defence; and the court should not admit evidence or instruct the jury
upon any contention not properly made in the record. Greer v. Herren, 99-492.
Submission of case on pleadings. —Where it was agreed by counsel that
the judge in the court below might decide from the pleadings, admis
sions, and inspection of an account offered in evidence, whether the
plaintiff was entitled to judgment : It was held, in effect, submitting the
case as a "case agreed." Grant v. Hughes, 94-231.
Whether issue of law or fact. —When the facts are admitted, whether or
not a claim of equity has been abandoned, is a question of law ; but
when the facts are disputed, they must be submitted to a jury. Thornburg v. Mastin, 93-258.
Questions of fact. —Before the acts and declarations of an alleged agent
made and done in the absence of the defendant, the alleged principal,
can be received in evidence, the trial judge must find as a fact that
prima facie evidence of the agency has been offered, and his ruling
upon this question of fact is beyond the reviewing power of the appel
late court. Smith v. Kron, 96-392.
Note.—In this case will be fonnd reference to numerous cases sus
taining trie right and duty of the court to pass upon questions of fact.
It is not necessary further to cite them.
See \ 399, post, and cases cited.
Sec. 398. Issues, how tried. C. C. P., s. 224.
An issue of law must be tried by the judge or court,
unless it be referred. An issue of fact must be tried by a
jury, unless a trial by jury be waived, or a reference be
ordered.
Right of trial by jury.—In all actions under The Code, when legal
rights are invoked, and issues of fact are joined by the pleadings, the
plaintiff is entitled to a trial by jury, and cannot be deprived of this
right, except by his consent. Andrews v. Pritchett, 66-387.
When an answer is put in good faith, the defendant has a right to have
the issues raised by it tried by a jury, and the court will not adjudge it
frivolous unless its allegations are clearly impertinent. Swepson v.
Harvey, 66-436; Erwin v. Lowery, 64-321 ; Womble v. Fraps, 77-198;
Hull v. Carter, 83-249. See ty, 247 and 388, ante, and \ 409, post, and
cases there cited.
A plaintiff cannot be deprived of his right to have issues of fact tried
by a jury by a motion to nonsuit in the midst of a trial. The right of a
jury trial is a constitutional right, and the motion to nonsuit substitutes
the judgment of the court for that of the jury. Andrews v. Pritchett,
66-387 ; Stith v. Lookabill, 71-25.
The constitution of the state, Art. 4, \ 13, provides "that in all issues
of fact joined in any court, the parties may waive the right to have the
same determined by a jury, in which case the finding of the judge upon
the facts shall have the force and effect of a verdict of a jury." The right
of jury trial here secured is not absolute, but only sub modo, that is, upon
all issues joined, the meaning of which term can only be ascertained out
side of the constitution, and in the legislation since, to secure the benefit
of this provision of the constitution. By section 391 of The Code, it is
seen that the issues arise upon the pleadings, and if they are issues of
law, they are to be tried by the court, but if they are of fact, they are
to be tried by jury, unless a jury is waived. When issues of fact are
thus made up and joined by the pleading, they stand for trial, and must
be tried in one of two ways either by the jury or by the court. Armfield
v. Brown, 70-27.
When an issue of fact is raised, involving the merits of the contro
versy, and the defendant, in apt time, demands a jury to try that fact,
it is error in the presiding judge to refuse such a demand and try the
issue himself. Isler v. Murphy, 71^-436.
A party is entitled to a jury trial unless he expressly waives his right.
Lippard v. Roseman, 72-427.
Where there is any evidence upon a controverted issue, it should be
submitted to the jury. Jones v Call, 93-170.
In equitable actions. —Under the present system, a party has a right to
a jury trial of an issue of fact, as well as when it involves an equitable
as a legal element entering into the merits of the controversy. Worthy
v. Shields, 90-192.
Issues of fact, as distinguished from questions of fact, in equitable as
well as legal actions, must be tried by a jury ; but this does not author
ize the finding of such issues on less evidence than a chancellor would
find them. Ely v. Early, 94-1.
In the trial by a jury of issues arising in equitable matters, the rules
of equity should be followed as far as possible. Ibid.
While a mistake in a deed cannot be corrected, or a deed absolute
upon its face converted into a trusH. upon a mere preponderance of the
evidence, or without proof of some fact de hors the deed inconsistent
with the idea of absolute ownership, yet if issues are submitted to a jury
without objection, and no exceptions are taken to the testimony, and no
instructions requested, the fitiding of fact by the jury cannot be reversed
by the trial court, sitting as a chancellor, or by the supreme court, on
appeal. Hemphill v. Hemphill, 99-436.
Not entitled to trial by jury. —A party charged with contempt, is not enti
tled to a trial by jury. Haker v. Cordon, 86-1 16 ; In re Deaton, 105-59 i
Move v. Cogdell, 66-403.
The constitution (Art. 1, sec. 19) guarantees the right to trial by jury,
in controversies respecting property, only in cases where, under the
common law, the demand that the facts should be so found, could not
have been refused, and in fixing the question of compensation to the
land-owner for the right-of-way condemned to the use of a railroad,
commissioners do not invade the province that, under the ancient law,
belonged exclusively and peculiarly to the jury. Railroad v. Parker,
105-246; Railroad v. Davis, 18-451; State v. Lyle, 100-497.
Upon an application to condemn lands for the purpose of drainage,
the issues of fact raised by the pleadings should be framed and settled
by a jury ; they cannot be raised or considered upon exceptions to the
report of the commissioners appointed to assess damages. Railroad v.
Ely, 101-8.
Issues of fact arising on exceptions to referee's report. —It would seem that
" issues of fact " made by exceptions to the report of a referee, in stating
an account, when eliminated by exceptions to the report, may be tried
by a jury, unless the parties waive the right to have them tried in that
manner. Keener v. Finger, 70-35.
When exceptions are filed to a report made under a compulsory refer
ence, " issues of fact " are raised thereby, and either party has the right
to have them tried by a jury. Green v. Castleberry, 70-20.
A reference by consent is a waiver of trial by jury, and the referee's
report has the effect of a special verdict. Battle v. Mayo, 102-413.
See \\ 420-423, post.
Finding an immaterial issue. —When, in an action for damages, the jury
fiud the first issue submitted in such a way as to absolve the defendant
from all liability, their finding in response to another issue the amount
of damages sustained is not inconsistent, but immaterial. Purnell v.
Purnell, 89-42; Gatling v. Boone, 101-61; Perry v. Jackson, 88-103.
See \\ 393, 395, ante, and 409, post, and cases there cited.
The right to open and conclude. —Although the affirmative of the issues
raised by the pleadings is upon the defendant, yet, if the affirmative of
any of the issues submitted to the jury is upon the plaintiff, he is enti
tled to open and conclude, if the defendant introduces evidence.
Churchill v. Lee, 77-341 ; Hoff v. Crafton, 79-592.
So that, when the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, unless he estab
lishes a bona fide ownership of certain property in controversy, he can
not be deprived of his right to open and conclude, by reason of the fact
that the defendant alleges that the plaintiff's title is fraudulent and void
and insists that that raises an affirmative issue on his part. Ibid.
Where the affirmative of all the issues is upon the defendant to sus
tain he has the right to open and conclude. McRae v. Lawrence, 75-289.
The rule, that a party alleging an affirmative is bound to prove it,
means the affirmative of any matter, the truth of which is essential to
his case. Hudson v. Wetherington, 79-3.
On the issue, " Did the plaintiff's testator pay for or purchase the
note in suit?" the right to open and conclude is with the plaintiff. Hud
son v. Wetherington, 79-3; Neal v. Fesperman, 46-446.
The party who asserts the affirmative of an issue has the right to open
and conclude the argument. A defendant who admits the execution of
a note sued on, but pleads payment, has the onus of proving it, and
hence the right to open and conclude. Love v. Djckerson, 85-5.
Note. —This is now governed by superior court rules 3 and 6 ( 104-936),
and no appeal lies from the ruling below, except when defendant intro
duces no evidence. Brooks v. Brooks, 90-142; Cheek v. Watson, 90302; Austin v. Secrest, 91-214.
Objectionable language of counsel. —Discretionary for judge to stop coun
sel or to correct their improper remarks in his charge. Kerchner v.
McRae, 80-219 ; State v. Matthews, 80-417; Greenlee v Greenlee, 93278.
If the language of counsel is gross the court should stop him. Can
non v. Morris, 81-139; State v. Caveness, 78-484; Jenkins v. Ore Co.,
65-363; State v. Sherrill. 82-693; State v. Rogers, 94-860.
It is the duty of the trial judge to watch the course of the arguments
to the jury, and to see that no injustice arising from it is done to either
the prisoner or the state, and. nothing appearing to the contrary, he is
presumed to have done so. State v. Rogers, 94-860.
The extent to which counsel may comment upon witnesses and par
ties must be left, ordinarily, to the sound discretion of the presiding
judge, which will not be reviewed, unless it is apparent that the impro
priety of counsel was gross and calculated to prejudice the jury. Devries v. Phillips, 63-53 : Gragg v. Wagner, 77-246 ; Goodman v. Sapp,
102-477.
The introduction or non-introduction of a party as a witness in his
own behalf should be subject of comment only as the introduction or
non-introduction of any other witness might be. This is the necessary
result of The Code, 'i 1350, which does not contain the clause, which is
in \ 1353. forbidding such comment in criminal prosecutions. Hudson
v.Jordan, 108-10; Goodman v. Sapp, 102-477.
Objection to comments of counsel is waived, unless exception is made
at the time. Horah v. Knox, 87-483; State v. Sugg, 89-527. State v.
Lewis, 93-581; State v. Powell, 106-635; Hudson v. Jordan, 108-10;
Holly v. Holly, 94-96 ; State v. Speaks, 94-865 ; State v. Sheets, 89-543.
There may, however, be instances where the abuse of privilege by
counsel is so gross that it will become the duty of the judge, ex mero
motu, to interfere. Holly v. Holly, 94-96; State v. Noland, 85-576.
Where there is an abuse of privilege by counsel in addressing the
jury, it is cured by the court at the time correcting it, and it is not error
if the presiding judge does not advert to it in his charge. Wilson v.
White, 80-280 ; State v. Kilgore, 93-533.
The comments of counsel in this case are not of such character as
will warrant a new trial. The rule as heretofore laid down approved.
Overcash v. Kitchie, 89-384 ; State v. Suggs, 89-527.
Improper remarks of counsel are not ground for a new trial when the
court cautioned the jury that they should not permit such remarks to
affect their minds. State v. Wilson, 90-736 ; State v. Rivers, 90-738.
Comments ofcounsel. —Counsel have a right to argue the law as well as the
facts to the jury, and in doing so they may read adjudged case?, but the
facts contained in such cases cannot be commented on as the facts of
the case on trial. State v. Powell, 94-965 ; Horah v. Knox, 87-483.
Where an amended answer had been filed, upon which alone the issues
were raised, it was error to allow the plaintiff's counsel to read and
comment to the jury on the original answer, which had not been intro
duced in evidence. Smith v. Nimocks, 94-243.
Where counsel in their argument to the jury commented on the fact
that a witness for the opposite party whose evidence tended to locate
the land in suit, had participated in running the lines of a grant to him
self, which lines constituted a part of the boundary of the land in suit :
// was held, not a fit subject for comment, to attack the witness, and
that counsel were properly stopped by the court, the grant to the wit
ness not having been attacked. Deming v. Gainey, 95-527.
In an action involving, among other things, the sanity cf the plain
tiff, his counsel, in addressing the jury, commented upon the failure of
one of the defendants to answer the sworn complaint, which reflected
upon his character. The complaint was not put in evidence: Held,
that upon objection by the other side, the court below erred in not stoping counsel. Smith v. Smith, 106-498.
The fact that a witness, who was present at a conversation had between
the plaintiff and defendant's agent, was not called to contradict the
plaintiff, though present in court assisting defendant in the trial, is a
legitimate subject for counsel's comment. Grubbs v. Insurance Co.,
108-472.
Where no evidence is offered. —Where no evidence on either side is sub
mitted to the jury, which is discharged, the cause still remains at issue.
Chastain v. Martin, 81-51.
Contra.—Where an issue is submitted to the jury, and the party upon
whom rests the burden of proof refuses to offer any evidence, it is proper
for the judge to direct the jury to answer the issue in favor of the other
side. Wallace v. Robeson, 100-206.
NOTE. —The latter seems the sounder rule.
Evidence should be restricted to issues. —On the trial of actions, the testi
mony offered by the parties and the instructions of the court to the jury
should be confined to the issues raised by the pleadings. Wilson v.
Taylor, 98-275; Morgan v. Railroad, 98-247.
It is not erroneous for the trial judge to reject evidence when there is
no issue to which it is applicable. Graves v. Trueblood, 96-495.
Where the answer does not put the plaintiff's title in issue, it is useless
for him to introduce evidence of it. Gregory v. Forbes, 96-77.
Submission of issue without evidence. —It is error to leave to the jury a
material fact upon which there is no evidence. Fortescue v. Makeley,
92-56.
If the evidence only raises a conjecture or suspicion of a fact, such
fact should not be left to the jury. State v. Powell, 94-965.
Exclusion of evidence. —Where an issue is raised by the pleadings and
submitted to the jury, it is error for the court to exclude any evidence
pertinent thereto. Farrior v. Houston, 95-578.
The action being adverse, and evidence introduced to show color of
title in plaintiff, defendant was entitled to reply, and the exclusion of
his evidence, which might have influenced the jury to decide for him,
entitles him to a new trial. Lenoir v. Mining Co., 106-473.
In assigning error for the exclusion of evidence, the record should
disclose what the evidence would have been if the witness had been
allowed to answer ; otherwise the exception will not be considered.
McGowan v. Railroad, 95-417.
Excluding evidence after admitting it. —Where the judge admits evidence
to which exception is made, and afterwards excludes it and instructs the
jury not to consider it, the exception to such evidence will not be con
sidered on appeal. State v. Gay, 94-814.
Irrelevant evidence. —Although evidence may be irrelevant, yet, if it
might have exercised a prejudicial effect on the minds of the jury, a
new trial will be granted. State v. Jones, 93-611.
It is not error to admit irrelevant testimony when it does not tend to
mislead the jury. Deming v. Gainey, 95-528.
Order of admission of evidence. —It is discretionary with the trial judge
to allow a party to introduce his evidence in any order which he may
desire. Ripley v. Arledge, 94-467; Mauney v. Coit, 86-463.
After testimony closed. —The court has power, after the evidence is
closed, to refuse to allow a witness to correct his testimony before the
jury, and to retain the matter to be heard on a motion for a new trial, if
the correction be material. Greenlee v. Greenlee, 93-278.
The court may, in its discretion, after the close of the testimony, per
mit the case to be re-opened and further evidence to be introduced, and
the exercise of such discretion is not reviewable upon appeal. Olive v.
Olive, 95-485.
Failure to introduce evidence in rebuttal. —It is no ground for a new trial
that the plaintiff failed to introduce evidence, which, by the permission
of the court, he withheld for rebuttal, because the defendant offered no
proof; he should have asked permission to continue his proofs when
the defendant declined to introduce evidence. Eigenbrun v. Smith,
98-207.
Use of documentary evidence. —Where counsel puts a paper in the hands
of a witness and asks him whether it is in his handwriting and proceeds
to found a question 0n such paper, the opposing counsel has the right
to use it. State v. Williams, 91-599.
Notes of testimony taken before a referee are not admissible as evi
dence on a trial of issues before a jury. Mott v. Ramsay, 92-152.
Pleadings. —The whole record is not in evidence. So much of the
pleadings ought to be read to the jury, as may be necessary to explain
and present the issues. Smith v. Nimocks, 94-243.
Pleadings are not evidence unless introduced as such. Smith v.
Nimocks, 94-243 ; Smith v. Smith, 106-498.
Sec. 3.9.9. Other issues to be tried b y the court or judge.
C. C. P., s. 22n.
Every other issue is triable by the court, or the judge
thereof who, however, may order the whole issue, or any
specific question of fact involved therein, to be tried by a
jury, or may refer it. And when a compulsory reference
is ordered, either party has the right to have the issues of
fact tried by a jury.
**
Action to set aside a deed for fraud. —In an action to set aside a deed far
fraud, a judge may, by this section of The Code, try such issues of fact
as are made by the pleadings. He may also submit to a jury issues so
framed as to present any question of fact on which he doubts, but he is
not bound by their verdict, and may proceed to find the facts otherwise
than they have found ; and he ma}' also find facts not embraced in the
issues submitted to them. Goldsborough v. Turner, 67-403.
Finding by jury of issues of law. —When a jury correctly decides a ques
tion of law, incorrectly left to them by the court, the verdict cures the
error. Thornburg v. Mastin, 93-258; Comron v. Standland, 103-207.
Questions of fact. —Issues which arise from the pleadings should only
be submitted. The court may, in its discretion, submit questions of fact
as allowed by the statute. Quarles v. Jenkins, 9S-258.
In attachment and other ancillary proceedings the court may find the
facts from the affidavits and other proper evidence. A party has no
right to a jury trial thereon which is restricted to issues of fact. Parsons
v. Lineberry, 90-159 ; Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612 ; Foushee v. Pattershall,
07-453See i! 397, ante.
Sec. 400. Issues of fact, when to be tried. C. C. P., s. 220.
Every issue of fact joined on the pleadings, and inquiry
of damages required to be tried by a jury, shall be tried at
the term of the court next ensuing such joinder of issue
or order for inquiry : Provided, such issue shall have been
joined or order for inquiry made, more than thirty days
before such term, but if not, they shall be tried at the
second term after such joinder or order.
Questions of fact. —This does not give a right to trial of questions of
fact by a jury. Denmark v. Railroad, 107-185.
Sec. 401. Trial may be postponed by clerk or judge before
the trial term on notice. C. C. P., s. 227.
Any party to an action may apply to the court in which
it is pending, or to the judge thereof, after three days'
notice in writing to the adverse party, to have the trial
deferred to a term subsequent to that in which it is regu
larly triable; such application must be made thirty days,
before the trial term, and must be on affidavit. The court
or judge may defer the trial as asked for, on such terms as
shall be just, if satisfied—
)
(1) That the applicant has used due diligence to have
his case ready for trial ; and,
(2) That by reason of circumstances beyond his control,
which he shall set forth, he cannot have a fair trial at the
regular trial term ; if the application is made by reason of
the expected absence of a witness, it shall state the name
and residence of the witness, the facts expected to be proved
by him, and the grounds for the expectation of his nonattendance, and that the applicant expects to procure his
evidence at or before some named subsequent term. The
applicant shall in all cases pay the costs of the application.
Sec. 40'3. Trial postponed by judge in term time, when.
C. C. P., 8. 228. B. C., c. 31, 8. 57 (13, 14-). 1885, c 394.
The judge, at any time during the term at which an
action is triable, may postpone the trial on the application
of either party, and on such terms as shall be just, if sat
isfied—
(1) That the applicant has used due diligence to be ready
for trial;
(2) That he cannot have a fair trial at that term by rea
son of circumstances stated, and if the ground of applica
tion be the non-attendance of a witness, the affidavit shall
contain the particulars required by subdivision two of the
preceding section. Unless the applicant shall also set forth
in his affidavit that the facts upon which his application is
grounded occurred or came to his knowledge too late to
allow him to apply as prescribed in the preceding section,
and that his application is made as soon as it reasonably
could be after the knowledge of such facts, the postpone
ment shall not be granted, except on the terms of the pay
ment of the costs in the action for the term.
NOTE.—This section was amended (ch. 394, acts 1885) by adding—
It shall be competent, in all civil cases only, for the other
side to controvert the allegations of fact in said applications,
and to offer counter-affidavits to that end, and the judge
shall not allow such continuance unless he shall be satis
fied, after thorough examination of the evidence as afore
said, that the ends of justice demand it.
Continuance a matter of discretion. —Granting or refusing a continuance
is in the discretion of the presiding judge, and it would require circum
stances proving, beyond a doubt, hardship and injustice, to induce the
supreme court to review the exercise of such discretion, if, indeed, it has
the power. Moore v. Dickson, 74-423; Banks y. Mfg. Co., 108-282.
An appeal from a continuance is useless, since the appeal itself works
a continuance. Isler v. Dewey, 79-1.
An order of continuance is not reviewable unless there is palpable
abuse. McCurry v. McCurry, 82-296; Austin v. Clarke, 70-458; Arm
strong v. Wright, 8-93. See J 548, post.
A party is not entitled to a continuance because the issues are not
made up. Wittkowski v. Watkins, 84-456.
In divorce.—Where, pending an action for divorce, the defendant
becomes insane, the cause will be continued as long as there is a hope
of reason being regained—here, two years. Stratford v. Stratford, 92-297.
Sec.
Order of business. C. C. P., s. 229.
The criminal calendar shall be first disposed of, unless,
by consent of counsel, or for reasons satisfactory to the
judge, particular criminal actions may be deferred. The
issues on the civil calendar shall be disposed of in the fol
lowing order, unless, for the convenience of parties or the
dispatch of business, the court shall otherwise direct:
(1) Issues of fact to be tried by a jury;
(2) Issues of fact to be tried by the court;
(3) Issues of law.
The court should be formally adjourned.—When the judge presiding leaves
a court finally before the term has expired, he should have it adjourned
and not leave it open to take care of itself. Such practice has no legal
sanction, and it gives rise to misapprehension, confusion and wrong.
Foley v. Blank, 92-476.
Sec. 404. Jury, how drawn. 1i. C.,c. 31,8.33. 1779, c.
157, s. 11.
The judges of the superior court, at the term of their
courts, shall direct the names of all persons returned as
jurors to be written on scrolls of paper and put into a box
or hat and drawn out by a child under ten years of age ;
.whereof the first eighteen drawn shall be a grand jury for
the court ; and the residue shall serve as petit jurors for the
court.
Disqualification of regular jurors. —A juror is not disqualified by failure
to pay his taxes for the previous year, when the sheriff has been
enjoined from collecting it. State v. Heaton, 77-505.
The existence of a suit at issue (in the same court) to which the juror
is a party at the time he is drawn, renders him incompetent as a juror.
State v. Smith, 8o-4ro.
A juror of the original panel is not subject to be challenged upon the
ground that he has served upon a jury in the same court within two
years. This disqualification only applies to tales jurors. State v. Brittain, 89-481.
The non-payment of taxes for the fiscal year next preceding the time
when the juror's name is placed on the jury list, is a disqualification.
State v. Haywood, 94-847 ; Sellers v. Sellers, 98-13 ; State v. Carland,
90-668 ; State v. Hargrave, 100-424 ; State v. Gardner, 104-739.
A juror is not disqualified by being a party to a suit, unless it is at issue.
Hodges v. Lassiter, 96-351.
The action of a court is in fieri during the term. So, where a juror
was challenged for cause on the ground that he had a suit pending and
at issue, and it appeared that a judgment had been rendered in the suit
to which he was a party at the same term, from which an appeal had
been taken, but not perfected, the challege was properly allowed. Wil
son v. Hughes, 94-182.
Note. —For former practice, see Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 810, 8ji.
Jury drawn under \ 1732 of The Code. —Where, upon failure of the county
commissioners to draw a jury for the third week, the court orders the
same to be drawn as prescribed by \ 1732 of The Code, such jury is legal.
Leach v. Linde, 108-547. See next section.
Sec. 405. Petit jurors sworn in civil cases; defaulting per
sons fined. R. €., c. 31, s. 34. 1700, c. 321. 1822, c.
1133, s. 1. 1HSU, c. 441.
The clerk shall, at the beginning of the court, swear
such of the petit jury as are of the original panel, to try
all civil cases ; and if there should not be enough of the
original panel, the talesmen shall be sworn ; and the petit
jurors of the original panel, as well as the talesmen, shall
be sworn as prescribed in the chapter entitled "Oaths" :
Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to disallow
the usual challenges in law to the whole jury so sworn or
to any of them ; and if by reason of such challenge any
juror shall be withdrawn, his place on the jury shall be sup
plied by any of the original venire, or from the bystanders
qualified to serve as jurors, and the judge or other presid
ing officer of the court shall decide all questions as to the
competency of jurors in both civil and criminal actions.
Any juror failing to appear shall be fined by the court the
sum of forty dollars, and notice shall issue to such juror to
appear at the next term of the court and show cause why
the judgment should not be made absolute.
Note. —The following provision in regard to summoning tales jurors
was enacted 1889, ch. 441.
In the trial of any action in any court of this state before
a jury, whether civil or criminal, in which the sheriff of
the county where the case is to be tried is a party to or has
any interest in the action, or when the presiding judge or
justice shall find upon investigation that the sheriff of the
county is not a suitable person, on account of indirect inter
est in or relative to the cause of action, to be entrusted
with the summoning of persons from among the bystand
ers in any particular case pending, such judge or justice
presiding at the trial shall appoint some suitable and desi
rable person to summon the jurors in place of the sheriff.
This amendment. —Construed. Boyer v. Teague, 106-571.
Disqualification of talea jurors. —A tales juror must own a freehold in
the county. State v. Cooper, 83-671.
A tales juror must have all the qualifications of a regular juror, with
the additional one of being a freeholder. State v. Whitley, 88-691.
A juror summoned, but who does not serve, is not disqualified as a
tales juror. State v. Thome, 81-555 : State v. Whitfield, 92-831.
To disqualify the juror he must have served in the same court within
two years. State v. Outerbridge, 82-617 ; State v. Howard, 82-623 ;
State v. Edens, 85-522.
Freeholder.—A tenant by the courtesy initiate is a freeholder in the
sense of that term applicable to the qualification of jurors. State v.
Mills, 91-581.
Findings of fact. —The findings of fact by the judge as to the qualifica
tion of a juror is not reviewable. State v. Carland, 90-668 ; State v.
Watson, 86-624 ; State v. Green, 95-6ri : State v. Kilgore, 93-533.
The finding of the court below that a juror is indifferent cannot be
reviewed. State v. Potts, 1oo-457.
Misnomer. —Where a juror was summoned as J. L. B., but entered on
the scroll J. S. B., this is deemed immaterial. State v. Mills, 91-581.
Oath. —An oath administered to a juror in the manner prescribed by
statute is sufficient. The juror need not repeat the words "so help me
God." State v. Paylor, 89-539.
Note. —Qualification of regular jurors. —It is a ground of chal lenge
(1) If they have not paid taxes for the preceding year, and are not of
good moral character and of sufficient intelligence. The Code 8 1722;
State v. Haywood, 94-847; State v. Griffin, 74-316 ; State v. Hargrave,
100-484 ; Sellers v. Sellers, 98-13 ; State v. Carland, 90-668 ; State v.
Gardner, 104-739. (2) If they have a suit pending" and at issue in the
superior court. The Code, \ 1728. Hodges v. Lassiter, 96-351; Wilson
v. Hughes, 94-182.
Qualification of talesjurors. —In addition to the grounds of challenge,
just cited, against regular jurors, as to tales jurors, it is also ground of
challenge: (1) If they are not freeholders. The Code, \ 1733; State v.
Cooper, 83-671 ; State v. Whitley, 88-691 ; State v. Mills, 91-581. (2) If
they have served in the same court as grand, petit, or tales jurors within
two years next preceding such term of the court. The Code, \ 1733 ;
State v. Thome, 81-555; State v. Outerbridge, 82-671 ; State v. Howard,
82-623; State v. Eden, 85-522; State v. Whitfield, 92-831.
Qualification of grand jurors. —The same grounds of challenge as
against regular jurors. The Code, % 404, 1722 and 1728.
Qualification ofjurors summoned on special venire. —Formerly they
were only required to be freeholders. The Code, $ 1739 ; State \. Carland, 90-668 ; State v. Kilgore, 93-533 ; State v. Starnes, 94-973. But
now, by ch. 53, acts 1887, they are liable to challenge on all four of
the grounds (above given) assignable against a tales juror.
Sec. 400. Names of jurors to be called before empaneled ;
right of challenge. R. C, c. 31, s. 335. 1790, c. 452, s. 2.
1812, c. 833.
The clerk, before a jury shall be empaneled to try the
issues in any civil suit, shall read over the names of the
jury upon the panel in the presence and hearing of the par
ties or their counsel ; and the parties, or their counsel for
them, may challenge peremptorily four jurors upon the
said panel, without showing any cause therefor, which shall
be allowed by the court.
Four peremptory challenges.—Whether there is one or more plaintiffs or
defendants, only four peremptory challenges to the jury on either side
are allowable. Bryan v. Harrison, 76-360.
Sec, for former practice, Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 811-816.
Sec. 407. Separate trials. C. C. P.. s. 230.
A separate trial between a plaintiff and any of the sev
eral defendants may be allowed by the court, whenever, in
its opinion, justice will thereby be promoted.
Severance discretionary. — It is within the sound discretion of the court,
on motion of the defendants, or any of them, to allow severance and a
separate trial as to each defendant, if thereby justice will be promoted.
But when the court held that the defendants had a right to demand it,
it was error, and the judgment rendered upon each holding must be
reversed. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95; State v. Smith, 24-402; State v.
Gooch, 94-1006; State v. Oxendine, 107-783; Grant v. Burgwyn, 84-560.
Effect of order. —An order of severance is equivalent to dividing the
action into several suits, with all the usual provisions for costs, etc.,
incident thereto. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95.
Sec. 408. General and special verdicts defined. C. C. P.,
s. 232.
A|general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce
generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of
the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by
which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment
to the court.
Definition. —A general verdict is a finding in favor of one of the parties
to an action': a special verdict finds the facts, but is not in favor of either
party', until the court declares the law arising thereon. Morrison v
Watson, 95-479.
Where the jury respond affirmatively or negatively to the issues sub
mitted to them, it is a general verdict, although there be several issues ;
when they state the facts, and leave the court to apply the law arising
upon them, it is a special verdict. Porter v. Railroad, 97-66.
Verdict sufficient.— Where, in an action to set up a lost deed, the jury
found that the defendant had not executed a deed for any part of the
land, but did not specifically find that no deed was ever executed, the
verdict was sufficiently responsive. Railroad v. Purifoy, 95-302.
The verdict, whether in response to one or many issues, must estab
lish facts sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment. Emry v.
Railroad, 102-209.
A verdict that a deed was obtained by fraud and undue influence, is
not inconsistent with the idea that it is constructive fraud only. Costen
v. McDowell, 107-546.
Not essential to poll jury.—It is not essential to the validity of a verdict
that the jury be polled. State v. Jones, 91-654.
Nor that counsel are present. —It is not essential to the validity of a ver
dict that counsel should be present at its rendition. State v. Jones, 91654; State v. Austin, 108-780.
Special verdict. —A special verdict is not always required. School Com
mittee v. Kesler, 66-323.
A special verdict must find all the facts necessary to enable the court
to give judgment. Hilliard v. Outlaw, 92-266.
If special verdict defective. —Where a special verdict is defective, a venire
de novo will be awarded. State v. Bray, 89-480.
If a special verdict fails to find all the facts essential to a decision of
the case, it is fatally defective, and a new trial must be awarded. State
v. Oakley, 103-408; State v. Crump, 104-763.
Practice on return of special verdict.—If the jury return a special verdict,
it is the duty of the court to declare the law thereon and cause a verdict
to be entered in accordance therewith. Then it should proceed to render
judgment, and no appeal will lie until such judgment is pronounced:
State v. Smith, 95-680.
A formal verdict in accordance with the opinion of the court must be
entered upon a special verdict before judgment can be pronounced.
State v. Morris, 104-837; State v. Moore, 107-770; State v. Nies, 107-820;
State v. Monger, 107-771. These cases reviewed and practice settled that
no formal verdict is necessary, but the court should pass judgment upon
the facts found in the special verdict. State v. Ewing, 108-755.
Appeal only lies from judgment.—Where a special verdict is returned, no
appeal lies until there has been a judgment entered on the verdict. State
v. Nash, 97-514.
Sec. 409. When jury may rentier either a
cial verdict, and when judge may direct a

In an action for the recovery of specific
erty, if the property has not been delivered

general or spe
special finding.
personal prop
to the plaintiff,
or the defendant, by his answer, claims a return thereof,
the jury shall assess the value of the property if their ver
dict be in favor of the plaintiff; or, if they find in favor
of the defendant, and that he is entitled to a return thereof,
they may at the same time assess the damages, if any are
claimed in the complaint or answer, which the prevailing
party has sustained by reason of the detention or taking
and withholding such property. In every action for the
recovery of money only, or specific real property, the jury,
in their discretion, may render a general or special verdict.
In all other cases the court may direct the jury to find a
special verdict, in writing, upon all or any of the issues,
and, in all cases, may instruct them, if they render a gen
eral verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be
stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon.
The special verdict or finding shall be filed with the clerk
and entered upon the minutes.
Irregularity in formation of jury cured.—Irregularity in the formation of
a jury is cured by the verdict. State v. Boon, 82-637; State v. Ward,
9-443.
Also cured by putting in answer or defence. State v. Matthews, 82-672.
Papers handed to jury. —It is error for the court to hand to the jury (on
their retirement) papers which have been read as evidence, if objection
is made. Williams v. Thomas, 78-47; Outlaw v. Hurdle, 46-150; Watson
v. Davis, 52-178; Burton v. Wilkes, 66-604.
Where papers were offered in evidence, but not read to the jury, it
was proper to refuse leave to the jury to take them into the jury-room.
Hannon v. Grizzard, 89-115.
Where the jury were allowed to take a certain paper with them to
their consultation -room, it cannot be assigned as error if the appellant
expressly agreed that they might do so. Angier v. Howard, 94-27.
It is not error to refuse to allow a deposition read upon the trial, to
be taken into the jury-room, upon the request of only one of the jurors.
Lafoou v. Shearin, 95-391.
See, for conduct and province of jury under former practice, Battle's
Digest, vol. 2, pp. 810-817.
Instructions as to nature of verdict.—In actions for the recovery of
money only, or of specific real property, the jury may in their discre
tion render either a general or special verdict, but in all other cases
the court may direct a special verdict, and it may instruct them,
if they find a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact,
material in the case, but which are not put in issue by the pleadings
Porter v. Railroad, 97-66 ; Bean v. Railroad, 107-731 ; Commissioners v.
Lash, 89-159.
The court has countenanced and approved the practice of defining, in
the verdict, the extent of the plaintiff's interest in the land in contro
versy, either by metes and bounds, or as an undivided fractional inter
est. Allen v. Sallinger, 103-14.
Where it appears from the proof offered to show title, or is admitted
on the trial, that a defendant who has confessed ouster by denying the
plaintiff's title is, in reality, a tenant in common with the latter, it is
the duty of the court to instruct the jury to ascertain and determine, by
a specific finding, the undivided interest of the plaintiff, ard to assess
his damages in proportion to such actual undivided interest. Gilchrist
v. Middleton, 107-663.
In a civil action, when there is no conflict of evidence, the judge
should direct the verdict to be entered. Purifoy v. Railroad, 108-100.
Instructions to find a special verdict. —The court has the power, under
The Code, \ 409, to direct a special finding upon an issue in an action
for an account and settlement of a trust fund, and so also in all other
cases except where the suit is for "money only" or " specific real prop
erty." Commissioners v. Lash, 89-159.
Where verdict is inconsistent. —Where the verdict upon the several issues
submitted is inconsistent, a new trial will be ordered. Mitchell v.
Brown, 88-156; Bank v. Alexander, 84-30; Porter v. Railroad, 97-66 ;
Puffer v. Lucas, 107-322.
The finding of a jury, in an action for damages for an assault, that
the defendant acted in self-defence, renders a finding as to the amount
of damages immaterial, and not inconsistent. Purnell v. Purnell, 89-42.
If there be an irreconcilable conflict in the findings of the jury upon
the issues submitted, or between the verdict and the judgment, a new
trial will be awarded. Morrison v. Watson, 95-479.
Where immaterial issues are by consent submitted to the jury with
others which are material, and it can be seen that the immaterial ones
do not affect the proper ones, nor mislead the jury, the verdict will not
be set aside, but judgment should be entered upon the finding on the
material issues, though that upon the others is inconsistent. Gatling v.
Boone, 101-61.
Where the plaintiff, in an action to recover land, demands judgment
in his complaint for a tract containing twenty-five acres, and the fol
lowing issue is submitted to the jury : " Is plaintiff the owner of the
land described in the complaint!" to which the jury responded, "Yes :
one-seventh of the Sandy Bottom tract, 160 acres ": Held, that the ver
dict is contradictory and a new trial will be ordered. Allen v. Sallinger,
105-333.
Construction of verdict. —Where no issues are eliminated and the record
states "the jury find all issues in favor of the plaintiff," the court will
understand it to mean that all matters in controversy arising on the
pleadings are found in favor of plaintiff. Rogers v. Clements, 92-81.
Or a new trial may be granted. Bowen v. Whitaker, 92-367.
The verdict must be taken in connection with, and interpreted by, the
issues, and when, by necessary implication, the answer to one issue dis
poses of the matter in controversy, it will not be set aside, although not
so full as might be desirable. Railroad v. Purefoy, 95-302.
A verdict of a jury may be made intelligible and operative by a refer
ence to a plat of a survey offered in evidence on the trial. Smith v. Fite,
98-517Condnct of jury. —The verdict of a jury cannot be impeached by one of
its members. State v. Royal, 90-755; State v. McLeod, 8-344; State v.
Smallwood, 78-560; State v. Brittain, 89-481; Lafoon v. Shearin, 95-391.
Evidence to impeach a verdict for the misconduct of a jury must come
from other sources than the jury itself. Jones v. Parker, 97-33; Johnson
v. Allen, 100-131; State v. Bailey, 100-528.
A verdict will not be set aside upon vague and indefinite proof that
some of the jurors were improperly approached and spoken to about
the case, especially where it is not alleged that the action of the jurors
so approached was influenced thereby. State v. Harper, 101-761; State
v. Gould, 90-658.
Where it appeared that, after several ballots in the jury-room, a propo
sition was made and assented to that the verdict of a majority of the
jurors should be the verdict to be returned, and, another ballot being
taken, some of the jurors adhered to their previous opinions, and there
upon the deliberations were continued and resulted in a conviction, and
the trial judge found the fact that the verdict was the voluntary action
of the j.urors, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. State v.
Harper, io1-761.
The presence of the officer in charge of the jury at their deliberations,
and the fact that the jury were allowed to separate, but still under the
charge of officers of the court, will not vitiate a verdict in the absence
of any proof or suggestion of improper conduct on the part of the jurors,
or the exercise of undue influence over them. Ibid.
Submission of issues to a jury.—Submitting to a jury issues upon points
not necessarily decisive of the case, and requiring verdicts neither gen
eral nor special, in form, is irregular. Henry v. Rich, 64-379.
The court can, in its discretion, submit issues compounded of law and
fact to the jury under instructions as to law, or it may direct the jury to
find the facts, and reserve the right to pronounce the judgment of the
law. Grant v. Bell, 87-34.
Where a party has voluntarily submitted a question to be tried by a
jury, which was properly triable by the court, but, upon evidence and
under instructions not excepted to, he cannot afterwards be heard to
raise the objection. Leggett v. Leggett, 88-108.
In ejectment, the issue as to damages should be submitted along with
the main issue, with instructions to the jury that if they find the main
issue in favor of defendant, not to consider the issue as to damages.

The question of negligence having already been settled by the verdict
of the jury, the question of substantial damages may be submitted by
the court. Brunhild v. Potter, 107-415.
See cases cited under \\ 393, 395, 398, ante.
Tender of deed after verdict. —In an action for specific performance,
where the defendant denies the equity of the plaintiff, after a trial upon
the issues joined, a tender of deed and demand for payment of purchasemoney comes too late. Houston v. Sledge, 101-640.
Recalling jury for instructions. —Whether the jury, having retired under
instructions to which there was no exception, shall be recalled for further
directions, is within the discretion of the court, and not reviewable.
Scott v. Green, 89-278 ; Lafoon v. Shearin, 95-391.
Or to re-open case for further argument or evidence. Pain v. Pain,
80-322 ; Olive v. Olive, 95-485.
Error in charge cured by verdict.—A new trial will not be granted, if the
verdict is a proper one, although it may have been returned in obedience
to an erroneous instruction from the court. Rountree v. Britt, 94-104.
In action for slander. — Where, in an action for slandering the plaintiff,
the words set out in the complaint are ambignous, but admit of a slander
ous interpretation, it should be left to the jury to say, under all the cir
cumstances, what meaning was intended. Reeves v. Bowden, 97-29;
Sasser v. Rouse, 35-142 ; Lucas v. Nichols, 52-33.
If the specific goods can be returned, though injured. — If the party offer to
return the goods, the other cannot compel him to pay their value,
although they may be deteriorated by exposure, decay or external injury,
or fall in price, as long as they remain in specie. Holmes v. Godwin,
69-467.
Damages, where the goods cannot be returned in specie. —If it appear on the
trial, that the property had been destroyed, so that there cannot be a
return, the jury would, probably, be justified in finding that fact, and
the claimant might then have judgment for the same, with interest from
the time of taking. Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467.
The value of the property must be assessed on the trial, and also the
damages for detention, in order that, if there cannot be a re-delivery of
the goods in specie, the party recovering may have execution for their
value. Ibid.
One element of damages for taking and detention is the difference in
value between the time of taking and the time of delivery, provided it
be less at the latter time. Ibid.
See \i 321, ante, and 431, post, and cases there cited.
Sec. 410. On special finding with general verdict, former .
to control. C. C. I'., s. 234.
Where a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent
with the general verdict, the former shall control the lat
ter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.
Sec. 411. Jury to asses* defendant's damages in certain
cases. C. C. P., s. 236.
When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an action for
the recovery of money, or for the defendant when a set-off
for the recovery of money is established, beyond the amount
of the plaintiff's claim as established, the jury must also
assess the amount of the recovery ; they may also, under
the direction of the court, assess the amount of the recovery
when the court gives judgment for the plaintiff on the
answer. If a set-off, established at the trial, exceed the
plaiutiff's demand so established, judgment for the defend
ant must be given for the excess ; or, if it appear that the
defendant is entitled to any other affirmative relief, judg
ment must be given accordingly.
Interest to date. —A verdict allowing "interest to date," where the date
of debt is uncontradicted, is sufficientlv definite. Greenleaf v. Railroad.
Sec. 412. Entry of the verdict ; motion for new trial on
Judge's minutes ; exceptions how taken, and when deemed
taken. C. C. P., s. 236.
(i) Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make an
entry in his minutes, specifying the time and place of the
trial, the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict,
and either the judgment rendered thereon, or an order that
the cause be reserved for argument or further consideration.
If a different direction be not given by the court, the clerk
must enter judgment in conformity with the verdict.
Jury recalled for further instructions.—It is discretionary with the pre
siding judge whether he will recall the jury and submit instructions
which were not presented until the charge was finished and the jury had
retired to consider of their verdict. Scott v. Green, 89-278; Lafoon v.
Sheariu, 95-391.
Verdict informal, jury to reconsider it.—It is the duty of the court to look
after the form and substance of a verdict, and, if it be informal, to direct
the jury to reconsider it. State v. Whitaker, 89-473; State v. Arrington, 7-571.
A mistake in a verdict of a jury may be corrected before it is recorded
and the jury discharged. State v. Shelly, 98-673.
Verdict imperfect, jury called together again. —Where a verdict rendered
to the clerk by consent is imperfect, the judge can call the jury together
again to perfect it. Willoughby v. Threadgill, 72-438 ; Robeson v.
Lewis, 73-107 ; Wright v. Hemphill. 81-33 ; Cole v. Laws, 104-651.
Where, without authority, the clerk took a verdict in the absence of
the judge, which was irresponsive to the issues, the judge has the power
to order the jury to retire and find another verdict, they not having dis
persed, and there being no allegation that they have been tampered
with. Petty v. Rousseau, 94-355.
The court has the right after the verdict is rendered, to propound
questions to the jury for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it
should set aside the verdict. Wilson v. Hughes, 94-182.
Where it was agreed that the clerk might take the verdict, bnt by per
mission of the court he was absent when the jury agreed, and they sealed
their verdict up and handed it to the sheriff and separated, and at the next
session of the court, the trial judge ordered the jury into the box and
the foreman opened the verdict, and each juror agreed to it in the pres
ence of the counsel for both sides : Held, that the verdict was regular,
there being no suggestion that either the verdict or the jury had been
tampered with. King v. Blackwell, 96-322.
Verdict received by clerk. —The clerk has no right to take the verdict of
a jury in the absence of the judge, unless expressly authorized by the
court to do so. Petty v. Rousseau, 94-355; State v. Austin, 108-780.
Verdict on Sunday. —A verdict rendered on Sunday is not invalid. State
v. Penley, 107-808.
When all issues not found. —When it appears from the record that an
issue is raised by the pleadings, which is left open and undetermined, it is error to enter final judgment before such issue was tried. Dickerson
v. Wilcoxon, 97-309; Hardy v. Carr, 104-33.
Verdict unintelligible and inconsistent. —Where a verdict is unintelligible,
conflicting and inconsistent, it should be set aside and no judgment pro
nounced. Puffer v. Lucas, 107-322.
Judgment to be signed. —The statutory provisions requiring judgments,
decrees, etc., to be signed by judges and clerks are not mandatory, and
a failure to observe them will not per se render such orders ineffectual.
Spencer v. Credle, 102-68.
On verdict, judgment. —A verdict adverse to the defences set up leaves
nothing to be done except to render judgment for the plaintiff. The
case is not like a ruling upon a demurrer or a motion in arrest of judg
ment. Kenner v. Manufacturing' Co., 91-421.
When an action has been heard upon its merits, and nothing remains
to be done but to give judgment, unless one of the parties suggests good
ground for delay, it is the duty of the court to render a final judgment.
Burgess v. Kirby, 94-575.
Judgment in vacation. —Parties by consent may authorize judgment to
be entered in vacation. Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243 : Harrell v. Peebles,
79-26 ; Hardin v. Ray, 89-364 ; McDowell v. McDowell, 92-227.
If in such case the judge renders judgment but goes out of office
before it is entered up by the clerk, at next term a motion to enter it
nunc pro tunc will be allowed. An appeal taken then is only from the
order allowing such entry and not from the judgment. McDowell v.
McDowell, 92-227.
See \ 384, ante.
Judgment cannot be set aside after the term except for mistake or excusable
neglect. —A judgment regularly entered cannot be set aside after court,
or at next term, except for mistake or excusable negligence under \ 274,
ante. Sharpe v. Rintels, 61-34 ; State v. Alphin, 81-566 ; Davis v.
Shaver, 61-18.
If by the inadvertence of the court, or of any one acting for it, the
judgment entered, or record made, is not in conformity to that pro
nounced or ordered, the court may it any time, upon the application of
any person in interest, or ex mero motu, correct it so that it shall truly
express the action of the court. This jurisdiction is distinct from that
conferred by sec. 274 of The Code, which provides a remedy for relief
against excusable mistake, etc., of parties to the action. Strickland v.
Strickland, 95-471.
See \ 274, ante, and cases cited.
(2) If an exception be taken upon the trial, it must be
reduced to writing at the time with so much of the evi
dence or subject-matter as may be material to the excep
tion taken ; the same shall be entered in the judge's
minutes and be filed with the clerk as a part of the case
upon appeal.
Exceptions to evidence must be in apt time. —Where incompetent evidence
is received without objection, the party affected by it cannot afterwards
complain. .Scott v. Green, 89-278.
Exceptions to evidence must be taken in apt time on the trial, or they
are waived. State v. Ballard, 79-627; Shields v. Whitaker, 82-516;
Gibbs v. Lyon, 95-146 ; State v. Brady 104-737. Except where the evi
dence is made incompetent by statute. State v. Gee, 92-756 ; Johnson
v. Allen, 100-131.

matters other than the charge must be taken at the time. Bank v.
McElwee, 104-305; Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718; Taylor v. Plummer,
io5-56An objection to remarks made by the judge, during the trial, must be
in apt time. Such an objection made after verdict, is not in apt time.
State v. Brown, 100-519.
Exception to an order for the consolidation of actions must l)e taken
at the time the order is made. Jones v. Jones, 94-1 1 1.
Immaterial or irrelevant evidence. —The admission of irrelevant or imma
terial evidence is not ground for a new trial, unless it prejudiced or was
calculated to prejudice the party excepting. Commissioners v. Lash,
89-159; Dupree v. Insurance Co., 92-417; Jones v. Call, 93-170; Ripley
■v. Arledge, 94-467; Waggoner v. Ball, 95-323; Scoggins v. Turner, 98-135;
Livingston v. Dunlap, 99-268; Patterson v. Wilson, 101-594; State v.
Shoemaker, 101-690; Jones v. Mizell, 104-9; State v. Eller, 104-853; State
v. Sidden, 104-845.
Admission of incompetent evidence. —The admission of incompetent testi
mony will not be sufficient to warrant a new trial, where it is apparent
it could work no injurv to the party objecting. Brown v. McKee,
108-387.
If a witness, on the cross-examination, in reply to a legitimate inquiry,
makes a statement of incompetent matter, the proper course is to applyto the trial judge to have it withdrawn, or to direct the jury to disregard
it; otherwise, it will not be treated as a valid ground of exception on
appeal. McRae v. Malloy, 103-154.
It lies in the unreviewable discretion of the presiding judge to refuse
to exclude incompetent testimony called out on cross-examination by
the party who seeks to have it excluded. Faulcon v. Johnston, 102-264.
liven if improper evidence is admitted in evidence, the error is cured
if the judge, in his charge, instructs the jury not to consider it. Har
din v. Ledbetter, 103-90; Bridgers v. Dill, 97-222.
Where evidence olTered by the plaintiff, bearing only on one issue, is
admitted after objection by the defendant, it caunot be assigned as error
if the verdict on that issue is in favor of the defendant, although the
judgment on t+ie entire verdict is against him. Graves v. Trueblood,
96-495.
Allowing an improper question to be asked cannot \x assigned for
error if the witness makes no response to it. Tobacco Co. v. McElwee,
100-150; Perry v. Jackson, 88-103.
Rejection of competent evidence. —The refusal to permit a proper question
to be asked cannot be assigned for error if the fact embraced in the
question is afterwards permitted to be shown. State v. Anderson,
101-,58; State v. Freeman, 100-429.
The rejection of evidence by the court, which, if admitted, would
have been prejudicial to the prisoner, cannot be assigned as error. State
v. Anderson, 93-732.
Exceptions to evidence must specify objection. —When an exception to evi
dence is so vague as not to point out the nature of the error complained
of, it will not be considered. Allred v. Burns, 106-247; Sumner v. Can
dler, 92-634; Everett v. Williamson, 107-204.
When a general objection is made, either to the competency of a wit
ness or to the reception of testimony, the party objecting may avail
himself of any grounds that may exist in support of his contention; but
in the case of testimony, if only a part of it is incompetent, the exception
will not be entertained if the evidence is severable. State v. Wilkerson,
103-337; Hammond v. SchifF, 100-161; Smiley v. Pearce, 98-185.
Error cannot be assigned for the rejection of evidence, unless it is dis
tinctly shown what the proposed evidence was, that its relevancy may
appear, and that prejudice was caused by its rejection. Knight v. Killebrew, 86-400; Whitesides v. Twitty, 30-431; Bland v. O'Hagan, 64-471;
Street v. Bryan, 65-619; State v. Purdee, 67-326.
The court below may require the grounds of objection to testimony to
be stated. If, after being required by the court to state his objections,
a party refuse so to do, his exceptions shall avail him nothing on appeal.
State v. Wilkerson, 103-337.
Where a party objects to a portion of an answer made by a witness,
because it is not responsive, he should ask the court to require its with
drawal or to tell the jury to disregard it. Deming v. Gainey, 95-528.
The defendant objected to the introduction of a deed by plaintiff with
out stating his grounds. The plaintiff introduced other evidence tend
ing still further to validate the deed. Defendant did not ask any instruc
tion as to the effect and character of the deed. He cannot, for the first
time, in the supreme court, raise objection that the deed was only evi
dence of color of title, or that it could not be considered at all. Wilhelm v. Burleyson, 106-381.
Objection that there was no evidence. —The objection that there is no evi
dence to go to the jury, must be taken on the trial below ; it cannot be
made, for the first time in the supreme court. State v. Bruce, 106-792 ;
Lawrence v. Hester, 93-79; State v. Glisson, 93-506.
Manner of conducting examination. —The manner of conducting the
examination of witnesses is left largely to the discretion of the judge,
and can but seldom be the subject of review, even when not entirely
approved by this court. State v. Brown, 100-519.
After case closed.—Refusal to allow further testimony after the case has
been closed is matter of discretion, and not subject to review. Dupree
v. Ins. Co., 92-417.
Exclusion of deposition. —Where the court below excluded a deposition,
but the record did not disclose the ground of the objection, but only
the fact that the deposition was excluded, the .supreme court will not
consider the exception. Smith v. McGregor, 96-101.
Witness not sworn.—When a witness was not sworn and the fact was
not discovered until after the jury had retired : // was held, not to entitle
the accused to a new trial as a matter of law. The correction of such
omissions is left to the discretion of the judge to set aside the verdict
and grant a new trial. State v. Gee, 92-756. .
Trial by consent. —Where, by statute, the superior court is authorized
to try any case by consent at a term devoted exclusively to ciiminal
actions, and a bastardy proceeding is regularly tried, the defendant mak
ing no objection until after the verdict : Held, that in law the defendant
is deemed to have assented to the trial, and his objection was not in apt
time. State v. Giles, 103-391.
Presumption against the exception. —Where the examination of a witness
is taken down in writing by a committing magistrate, and afterwards
read in evidence on the trial in the superior court, the defendant object
ing, and it does not appear from the record and statement of case on
appeal, whether the witness signed the examination or not, it will be
presumed on appeal that the witness did sign, and that the magistrate
complied with the duties imposed upon him by the statute. State v. Wilkerson, 103-337.
See \\ 398 and 409, ante.
(3) If there shall be error, either in the refusal of the
judge to grant a prayer for instructions, or in granting a
prayer, or in his instructions generally, the same shall be
deemed excepted to without the filing of any formal objec
tions.
Exception to charge cannot be made for first time in the supreme court.—Ex
ception to the charge, unlike all other matters on the trial, need not be
taken "at the time." By virtue of this section the charge is deemed
excepted to. None the less the exceptions must be set out by appellant
in his case 011 appeal, or the exception is waived. Exceptions to the
charge cannot be made for the first time in the supreme court. McKinnou v. Morrison, 104-354 \ F«7 v- Currie, 91-436 ; Lytle v. Lytle, 94-552 ;
Ware v. Nesbit, 94-664; Pleasants v. Railroad, 95-195; Scott v. Rail
road, 96-428 ; Pollok v. Warwick, 104-638 ; Whitehurst v. Pettipher, 10540 ; McMillan v. Gambill, 106-359.
NOTE.—Prior to the adoption of the section as it now stands, the excep
tion- to the instructions of the judge must have been taken at the trial
and noted. Williamson v. Canal Co., 78-156; Stout v. Woody, 63-37;
White v. Clark, 82-6; Morgan v. Smith, 77-37; Harrison v. Chappel,
84-258.
Contra. —Although no exception be taken to the charge at the time,
vet if there be error in the instructions given, the party may assign it.

82-504; Burton v. Railroad, 84-192; Ring v. King, 20-164; Grist v.
Backhouse, 20-164.
•
It is now, however, "well settled " by above decisions that an objec
tion to judge's charge is not required to be taken on the trial, but can
not be taken for the first time in the supreme court. It is sufficient if
set out in the appellant's case on appeal, but the practice commended
by the court (though not held obligatory) is to assign errors to the charge
in a motion for a new trial under subsection 4 of this section.
Omission to charge. —An omission to charge on a particular aspect of
the case is not error, unless an instruction was asked and refused. Simp
son v. Blount, 14-34 ; Brown v. Morris, 20-429 ; State v. O'Neal, 29-251;

ment Co., 107-368; State v. Fleming, 107-905 ; Boon v. Murphy, 108-187.
Exception to charge must be specific. —An unpointed broadside challenge
"to the charge as given " will be disregarded. McKinnon v. Morrison,
104-354 ; Lytle v. Lytle, 94-522 ; Bost v. Bost, 87-477 ; Fry v. Currie

Co., 107-449; State v. McDuffie, 107-885; Everett V. Williamson,
107-204; State v. Brabham, 108-793.
Where a party excepts to a charge of the judge, that there was no
evidence of fraud, the exception should point out the evidence in which
it is claimed that fraud appears. Otherwise the appellate court may
disregard it. Giles v. Hunter, 103-194.
Exceptions to charge may be made for first time in appellant's case on appeal,—
Exceptions to the charge, and for refusing to give special instructions,
are in time if taken at or before the stating of the case on appeal,
though the better practice is to assign all exceptions in making motion
for new trial. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
Error in the charge to the jury may be assigned for first time in

Error favorable to appellant.—An error in the judge's charge, which is
not unfavorable to the party complaining is not ground for a uew trial.
Cowles v. Hall, 90-330.
See \\ 413 and 550, post, and cases cited ; also, Battle's Digest, vol. 2,
pp. 1008-1017.
(4) The judge who tries the cause may, in his discretion,
entertain a motion, to be made on his minutes, to set aside
a verdict and grant a new trial upon exceptions, or for
insufficient evidence, or for fexcessive damages; but such
motion can only be heard at the same term at which the
trial is had. When such motion is heard and decided upon
the minutes of the judge, and an appeal is taken from the
decision, a case or exceptions must be settled in the usual
form, upon which the argument of the appeal must be had.
Modification of verdict.—The court can set aside, but cannot amend or
modify, a verdict. Shields v. Lawrence, 82-516.
Partial new trial.—A new trial on one or more issues can be granted,
where the issue found incorrectly, or the erroneous ruling as to evidence
or erroneous charge plainly affected such issue only, but in all other*
cases the new trial, if granted, must be on all the issues. Meroney v.
Mclntyre, 82-103; Burton v. Railroad, 84-192.
Where the error is only as to the issue as to damages, a new trial may
be awarded thereon, leaving the verdict and judgment undisturbed in
other respects. Crawford v. Mfg. Co., 88-554; Roberts v. Railroad,
88-560; Lindsay v. Railroad, 88-547; Geer v. Reams, 88-197; Boing v.
Railroad, 91-199.
Where the error affected the verdict for the recovery of a tract of land,
but only as to a part of the land, the issue not being divisible, a partial
new trial cannot be granted. Beam v. Jennings, 96-82.
Motion mast be made and heard at same term.— The judge must hear a
motion for a new trial, for the causes mentioned in this section, at the
term the case is tried, and has no power to continue it to another term.
England v. Duckworth, 75-309.
This section was not intended as a statement of all the grounds of a
new trial, but as additional to the grounds mentioned in \ 274, and
also to prescribe that, in the cases mentioned here, the motion must be
made at the term when the trial is had. Quincy v. Perkins, 76-295;
Puffer v. Lucas, 107-322.
In judgments founded upon verdicts, the relief should be by motion
for a new trial, made at the term when rendered, and, being addressed
to the discretion of the trial judge, his ruling thereon is conclusive,
unless it is based on a want of power, in which event it is reviewable on
appeal. Moore v. Hinnant, 90-163; Beck v. Bellamy, 93-129; Cleninions
v. Field, 99-400.
New trial properly granted. —It is not error to grant a new trial where
the issues submitted to the jury were confused. Tankard v. Taukard,
79-54A new trial is properly granted where the findings of the jury are
irreconcilable. Bank v. Alexander, 84-30; Mitchell v. Brown, 88-156.
New trial properly refused. —It is error to grant a new trial on the ground
that damages are excessive, when the evidence showed the actual amount
of damage and the verdict was in accordance therewith. Winburne v.
Bryan, 73-47.
New trial discretionary. —Where the circumstances are such as merely
put a suspicion on the verdict by showing, not that there was, but that
there might have been, undue influence brought to bear upon the jury
because of the opportunity for it: Held, that the granting a new trial is
discretionary with the presiding judge. State v. Brittain, 89-481; State
v. Gould, 90-658; State v. Harper, 101-761. See \ 409, ante.
An application for a new trial, except for error of law in the conduct
of the trial, is addressed solely to the discretion of the presiding judge,
whose decision is not appealable. Carson v. Dellinger, 90-226.
The granting of a new trial for excessive damages is exclusively in
the discretion of the court below, and not reviewable. Goodsou v.
Mullen, 92-211.
Where a new trial was asked on the ground that one of the jurors,
who sat on the trial of the case, became insane very shortly after
the verdict was rendered, and so might be supposed to have been insane
while acting as a juror, the matter is entirely in the discretion of the
trial judge, in the absence of any finding of fact that the juror was
insane while on the jury. State v. Rogers, 94-860.
Where the motion for a new trial is addressed to the discretion of the
trial judge, his action is not the subject of review on appeal. Jones v.
Parker, 97-33The proceedings of a court are in fieri until the close of the term,
and the judge may, in the exercise of his discretion, without notice
and without stating the facts upon which he bases his action, at any
time during the term, vacate, modify or reverse anything done therein ;
and the exercise of such power is not reviewable, unless, perhaps, it
should be made to appear it had been grossly abused, and resulted in
oppression. Allison v. Whittier, 101-490.
It is competent for the trial court, in its discretion, to grant a new
trial if it has reason to believe injustice has been done, but from its
refusal to do so, there is no appeal. State v. Braddy, 104-737.
Where there is some evidence, it is entirely within the discretion of
the trial judge to say whether he will allow the verdict to stand. Owens
v. Phelps, 95-286.
It cannot be assigned as error, on appeal, that the jury did not give
due consideration to the evidence, cousidered in one aspect of the case.
This is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge on an application
to set aside the verdict. Spence v. Clapp, 95-545.
Verdict against the weight ofevidence.—Granting a new trial on the ground
that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, is a matter within
the discretion of the judge below, and not reviewable, unless it appear
that the judge was influenced in the exercise of such power by an erro
neous view of the law. Davenport v. Terrell, 103-53.
The refusal of the court below to set aside a verdict on the ground
that it was against the weight of the evidence cannot be reviewed on
appeal. Whitehurst v. I'ettipher, 105-40; Ferrall v. Thompson, 107-420.
It is in the discretion of the court below to refuse, or to grant a new
trial, because the verdict was against the evidence as when it was against
the weight of the evidence, and no appeal lies from its exercise. Red
mond v. Stepp, 100-212.
Objection to judgment. —Ordinarily a judgment is conclusive as to all
matters entering therein, and objection thereto should be taken at the
time the judgment is rendered. Dickerson v. Wilcoxon, 97-309.
After verdict.—Where the defendant pleads sole seizin, he cannot,
after a verdict in favor of plaintiff, avail himself of a defence which
would be in harmony with the verdict. Allen v. Sallinger, 103-14.
On appeal. —Under the practice in this state, where the record shows a
motion for a new trial for certain alleged errors, only such errors will
be considered in the supreme court, all other exceptions taken at the
trial being treated as abandoned. Leak v. Covington, 99-559.
Where an appeal is taken from an order, granting or refusing a new
trial, the facts and considerations which induced the trial judge to grant
or refuse a new trial, should be stated on the record, in order that the
appellate court may see whether the judgment is subject to review.
Braid v. Lukins, 95-123.
New trial for newly discovered testimony. —The rules in relation to appli
cations for new trials for newly discovered evidence and the principles
on which they are founded, discussed by Pearson, C. J. Bledsoe v.
Nixon, 69-81.
Granting a new trial because of newly discovered evidence must
necessarily always, or nearly always, be within the discretion of the
presiding judge, and his decision can very rarely in such cases be on a
naked matter of law or legal inference so as to authorize an appeal.
Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467.
In an affidavit in support of a motion for a new trial' for newly dis
covered evidence, in ascertaining the whereabouts of a witness since the
trial, it is not sufficient in accounting for its being previously unknown
to state that " every means had been used to find out where the witness
was." The applicant should state what means he did use and let the
court judge. ShehaTi v. Malone, 72-59.
A motion for a new trial for newly discovered testimony, should only
be granted if the testimony discovered since the trial is probably true and would have produced a different result if known, and when it could
not have been then discovered by reasonable diligence and such reason
able diligence was in fact used. Henry v. Smith, 78-27 ; Dupree v.
Insurance Co., 93-237.
The granting of a new trial for newly discovered evidence and for
matter occurring since the trial where the application is made to the
supreme court, is a matter of sound discretion depending upon the cir
cumstances of each case. Carson v. Dellinger, 90-226.
A new trial will not be granted for newly discovered evidence, when
the new evidence is merely cumulative, and only tends to contradict the
witness for the other side. State v. Starnes, 97-423.
When new evidence is discovered during the term, a motion for a new
trial on account of it must be made to the court which tried the case,
and if denied, it will not be heard in the supreme court. Ferrall v.
Thompson, 107-420; Redmond v. Stepp, 100-212 ; Carson v. Dellinger,
90-226; Munden v. Casey, 93-97.
Where the newly discovered evidence tends only to contradict a wit
ness on the other side, a new trial will not be granted. Brown v. Mitchell,
102-347.
Motion for new trial pending an appeal. —If an application for a new trial
for newly discovered evidence is made during an appeal pending in the
supreme court, upon a proper case that court will remand the case that
the superior court may take proper action. If the newly discovered
evidence applies to only part of the judgment, the supreme court will
retain the cause and send down proper issues to be tried. Feuding the
appeal, the motion cannot be made in the superior court. Bledsoe v.
Nixon, 69-81 ; Shehan v. Malone, 72-59 ; Henry v. Smith, 78-27.
In jnstice's court. —A new trial cannot be allowed iu a justice's court.
The party dissatisfied has his remedy only by appeal (The Code, <> 865,)
but where the judgment is rendered in the absence of either party and
such absence is occasioned by any of the causes specified in 'i 845, relief
may be had within ten days after judgment by filing an affidavit setting
forth the grounds therefor before the justice. Gambill v. Gambill,
S9-201.
Sec. 4 i:t. Judge to explain law, but to express no opinion
on facts. C. C. P., s. 237. Jt. C.,c. 31, s. 130. 1706, c.
4X2, s. 1.
No judge, in giving a charge to the petit jury, either in
a civil or a criminal action, shall give an opinion whether
a fact is fully or sufficiently proven, such matter being the
true office and province of the jury ; but he shall state in
a plain and correct manner the evidence given in the case,
and declare and explain the law arising thereon.
What is an expression of opinion.—It is error for the judge to charge the
jury that they must find for one of the parties, unless they believe his
witness had committed perjury. State v. Thomas, 29-381.
It is a clear violation of the prohibition against the judge expressing an
opinion as to the facts, for a judge to tell the jury that a book of science,
read by counsel, was eutitled to as much authority as a witness who had
been examined as an expert. Melvin v. Easley, 46-386.
Any remark made by the judge from which the jury can infer what
his opinion is as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence, or of
any part of it pertinent to the issue, is error, and it is not corrected by
his telling the jury that it is their exclusive province to weigh the evi
dence, and that they are not bound by his opinion in regard thereto.
State v. Dick, 60-440.
When a judge in charging a jury says, " If her character (referring
to a witness) is of ordinary respectability, you will take her testimony
to be true, unless she is fully and thoroughly contradicted," this is error.
State v. Parker, 66-624.
The judge who tries an action has no right to intimate in any manner
his opinion as to the weight of the evidence, or to express an opinion 011
the facts. When there is any evidence to the contrary, it is error for the
judge to say "we are not informed," of a matter on which the jury
should pass. Powell v. Railroad, 68-395..
The judge cannot weigh the evidence, and declare the result to the
jury as a matter of law. State v. Locke, 77-481.
A judge is not justified in expressing to the jury his opinion upon the
evidence adduced. State v. Dixon, 75-275.
It is error, as intimating an opinion on the facts, to charge that the
fact that the witness is included in the same indictment will impair his
testimony, and that it should not be put on the same plane with that of
a disinterested witness of undoubted character. State v. Jenkins, 85-544.
What is not an expression of opinion. —It is not a violation of this section
for the judge to tell the jury that a witness " had given a fair and can
did statement, and appeared to be a creditable man," the statement
being admitted to be correct. State v. Davis, 15-412.
The judge is not a mere moderator. He is an integral part of the
mixed tribunal which is to pass upon the issue. While he is forbidden
to express to the jury any opinion upon the facts, he is bound to declare
and expound to them the law applicable to the case. State v. Johnson,
23-354The prohibition restraining the judge from expressing to the jury an
opinion as to the "facts" of the case, only applies to those "facts"
respecting which the parties take issue or dispute, and upon whose exist
ence depends the liability of the defendant. State v. Angell, 29-27.
It is not giving undue weight to the statement of a witness for the
court in its charge to make an explanation protecting him from the
unjust animadversions of counsel, especially where the erroneous ruling
of the court had afforded the occasion for the animadversions. State v.
Whit, 50-224.
It is not sufficient that what the judge said or did, might have had an
unfair influence on the jury ; but it must appear with ordinary certainty
that it was likely to have had an unfair influence, or to convey to the
jury his opinion on the weight of the testimony. State v. Jones, 67-285.
A remark by the judge that a witness is "overcome with emotion"
is not a violation of this section. State v. Laxton, 78-564.
It is no invasion of the province of a jury for the judge, on the trial
of an issue involving the mental condition of a party to the contract, to
charge that the "law attaches peculiar importance to the opinion of
medical men who have the opportunity of observation upon questions
of mental capacity, as by study and experience they become experts in
the matter of bodily and mental ailments." Flynt v. ftodenhamer, 80-205.
It is the duty of the court to state in a plain and correct manner the
evidence in the case, and to declare and explain the law arising thereon,
but he invades the province of the jury if he expresses an opinion as
to the weight of the evidence. State v. Hardee, 83-619.
A remark of the judge that a long cross-examination had been earried
far enough, made in such a way as was not calculated to express any
opinion upon the weight of the evidence, is not assignable for error.
State v. Robertson, 86-628.
It is not error for a judge in his charge to the jury to pronounce a
moral dissertation, provided the language used is without prejudice to
either party. Stilley v. McCox, 88-18.
Where the relation of principal and agent subsists, the demand for
an account necessary to put the statute of limitations in operation must
be such as to put an end to the agency ; an application by letter asking
information of the agent concerning the trust fund is not such demand,
and the remark of the Judge in this case that the letter upon its face
does not purport to be a demand, was no invasion of the province of the
jury. Com'rs v. Lash, 89-159.
When the jury come into court and announce their inability to agree,
it is not a violation of this section for the judge to intimate to them that
if their failure to agree arises from a disregard of his charge, he will
keep them together till the end of the term. Hannon v. Grizzard,
89-115; Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
It is not error for the judge to remind the jury—such being the fact—
that there was no evidence before them that the parties who might be
called as witnesses, to corroborate the declarations of the plaintiff, were
alive at the time of the trial. Buxly v. Buxton, 92-479.
Nor for the judge to tell the jury that the evidence that the intestate
had seen the bond, and admitted that he had executed it, if beljtved by
the jury to be true, is entitled to more weight thau the opinions of
experts as to the genuineness of the signature, and that such opinions
should be received with caution. Ibid.
Where the judge in his charge to the jury, does not draw any infer
ence of the fact himself, or direct them to do so, but only points out
the evidence to them, leaving them to draw their own inferences, the
charge is not objectionable. State v. McNeill, 93-553.
It is not error for the judge to say in the presence and hearing of the
jury, that he will not allow correction by witness of evidence to be then
made, but will retain the matter to be heard on a motion for a new trial.
Greenlee v. Greenlee, 93-278.
When counsel called the judge's attention to testimony omitted by
him in summing up, and he replied, "Yes, I believe she did say that,"
this is not an expression of opinion. State v. Freeman, 100-429.
It is not error to give to the jury an illustration of the difference
between positive and negative testimony, when the court further tells
them that it is an explanation merely, and they must find the facts for
themselves according to the weight they shall give to the evidence. State
v. Gardner, 94-953.
In cases where the character of the evidence is suspicious, the trial
judge may call the fact to the attention of the jury, as in the case of
accomplices', or near relatives of the accused, or of fellow-servants, or of
a witness who has sworn falsely in a part of his testimony, but these
matters of discredit are for the jury to consider, and the judge can only
caution the jury, so as toinduee them to make a careful scrutiny of such
evidence. Ferrall v. Broadway, 95-551.
A remark by a judge, in the hearing of the jury, when he permitted,
in his discretion, a witness to be recalled and asked a question to impeach
his credibility, that if he had known counsel intended to ask that ques
tion he would not have allowed the witness to be recalled, is not an
expression of opinion about the facts, in violation of the act of 1796.
De Berry v. Railroad, 100-310.
Where the jury asked for instructions from the judge, as to whether
they had the right to pass upon the legality of certain votes, and the
judge told them no, and advised the jury that they should take and act
upon the law as laid down by him. In this, there was no error. DeSerry
v. Nicholson, 102-465.
On an indictment for slandering an innocent woman, a witness for
defendant, in answer to a question by the solicitor, said prosecutrix's
character was good. Defendant's counsel asked him if he had not heard
one G. say that he had sexual intercourse with prosecutrix? Thereupon
the solicitor said to the court that he would not object to the inquiry, if
he would be allowed to prove that G., who was then in Texas, had denied
making such statement. Defendant's counsel 6aid he would object to
such proof. The judge then asked defendant's counsel, in the hearing
of the jury, if he thought "that would be fair?" Held, that the remark
of the judge was no violation of this section. State v. Brown, 100-519.
The judge said to a hung jury, that it was their duty to agree, if posble ; that no juror, from mere pride of opinion, should refuse to agree,
but he was not required to surrender conscientious views founded on
evidence ; that it was the privilege and duty of each juror to reason with
his fellows concerning the facts in the case, with an honest desire to
arrive at the truth and a verdict. Such charge is free from objection.
Warlick v. Plonk, 103-81.
A remark of the judge made before trial begun, that the jailor had
informed him the prisoner "would escape if he had the opportunity," is
not an expression of opinion upon the facts prohibited by the act of
1796. State v. Jacobs, 106-695.
Where the judge invited argument in the presence of the jury, when
the plaintiff rested, as to whether he had made a prima facie case, and
when he directed the defendants to proceed in the development of their
case, and told the jury then, and subsequently charged them, that they
must not be influenced in favor of defendants by his inviting argument,
nor against them by his order to proceed with the introduction of their
testimony: Held not to be error. Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
Remarks by the court of doubtful propriety are not ground of excep
tion, where it appears they did no harm to the party excepting. State
v. Brabham, 108-793.
At any time during the trial.—It is a violation of this section for the
judge, at any time during the trial, to express an opinion before the jury
on the weight of the evidence. State v. Browning, 78-555; March v.
Verble, 79-19; Sever v. McLaughlin, 79-153; Fickey v. Merrimon, 79-585.
Intimation of opinion by emphasis.—The judge may. by his manner or
emphasis, infringe this rule, but the record must set it out so the court
can judge of it. Reiger v. Davis, 67-185.
It is error for a judge, in his charge to the jury upon a point in the
evidence, to ask a question as to what that could mean, with emphasis
calculated to show his opinion thereon. State v. Dancy, 78-437.
If the court expresses or intimates an opinion. —If the court expresses an
opinion on the facts, a new trial will be awarded. Orbison v. Morrison,
7-551; Tate v. Greenlee, 7-556; Powell v. Railroad, 68-395.
If the court intimates to the jury his opinion on matters of fact, it is
ground for a new trial. Reel v. Reel, 9-63; Nash v. Morton, 48-3.
If evidence is sufficient. —The judge may say to the jury that a particular
fact is proved if the jury believes the witness who deposes to it. Sneed
v. Creath, 8-399; Hannon v. Grizzard, S9-115.
Where the evidence is direct, leaving nothing to inference, and, if
believed, is the same thing as the fact sought to be proved, the judge can instruct the jury that if they believe the witness they may find for the
plaintiff or defendant; but this is not allowed where the evidence is circumstautial, or where the evidence on the other side tends to explain it,
or to rebut the inference, or to contradict the witness. Gaither v. Ferebee, 60-310.
If there is no material conflict in the evidence offered upon the trial
of an issue, it is not erroneous to instruct the jury that, if believed, a
verdict should be rendered accordingly. Purefoy v. Railroad, 108-100;
Chemical Co. v. Johuson, 101-229.
When the facts are ascertained, the presumption becomes a conclusion
of law, to be enforced by the court and not left to the jury. Houck v.
Adams, 98-520.
If there is no evidence. —A judge has no right to inform the jury how
much weight is to be given to testimony, but it is his duty to inform them
when it weighs nothing. Reed v. Schenck, 13-415; Wells v. Clements,
4S-16S; State v. Allen, 48-257; State v. Duulap, 65-2SS; Witkowsky v.
Wasson, 71-451; State v. McKinsey, 80-458.
A judge, in charging a jury, has a right to tell them there is no evi
dence upon a question, but not to tell them that the evidence is not suf
ficient to warrant them in finding one way or the other. Wells v. Clem
ents, 48-168.
If there is no evidence to support an issue, the court should so charge
the jury. Barber vj Roseboro, 97-192; Willis v. Branch, 94-142.
If the evidence, considered as a whole, will not, in any just and rea
sonable view of it, warrant the verdict, then there is no evidence suf
ficient to be left to the jury, and the court should so declare. State v.
Powell, 94-965; Smith v. McGregor, 96-101; Covington v. Newberger,
99-523The objection that there is no evidence, or not sufficient evidence to
warrant a verdict, should be made when the testimony is all in, and the
court should be requested to so instruct the jury; but if there is any
evidence, and it is permitted to go to the jury without objection, the
verdict will not be disturbed by the supreme court. Sugg v. Watson,
101-188.
Distinction between no evidence and insufficient evidence. —Evidence which
merely shows it is possible for the fact in issue to be true, or which
raises a mere conjecture that it was so, is an insufficient foundation for
a verdict, and should not be left to a jury. We may go further and say,
that the evidence must be such as will support a reasonable inference of
the fact in issue. State v. Vinson, 63-335.
Whether there be any evidence is a question for the court ; whether
there be sufficient evidence is for the jury. The term "any evidence "
in this formula does not mean a mere scintilla of evidence, but suffi
cient to enable a jury reasonably to infer the existence of the alleged
fact. Wittowsky v. Watson, 71-351. Mr. Justice Bynum dissents from
this principle, and Mr. Justice Reade qualifies his assent.
If there is any evidence tending to prove a controverted proposition
and reasonably sufficient to establish it, such evidence should be sub
mitted to the jury. State v. Matthews, 80-417; Powers v. Erwin,
108-522.
Whether there is any evidence, is a question for the court ; what
weight is to be given it when there is any, is for the jury. State v.
Powell, 94-965; State v. McBride, 97-393.
Disagreement as to what the evidence is. —Upon a disagreement of coun
sel as to the testimony of a witness, upon the trial of a cause in the
superior court, the court recalled the witness, and reduced his testimony upon the disputed matter verbatim, to writing, which, upon being read
to the witness, was acknowledged by him to be correct. Counsel made
no objection to the correctness of the written evidence, and the same
was read to the jury by the court: Held, that it was not error in the
court below to refuse to allow counsel to argue to the jury that the wit
ness, when recalled, had made a different statement from that read to
the jury by the court. Davis v. Hill, 75-224.
When the judge and counsel differ as to the testimony of a witness,
it is competent for the judge to submit his notes to the jury, explaining
that he might be mistaken in taking down the notes, but the jury could
refresh their memories by them. State v. Keath, 83-626.
When counsel disagree as to what a witness testified it is error for the
court to say, " I will state it, so that it will be moral perjury for the jury
to accept the statement of defendant's counsel." State v. Sykes, 79-618.
Where there is a conflict between the recollection of the trial judge
and counsel as to what a certain witness testified, it is not error
for the judge to leave the matter to the jury as to what the evidence is.
Spence v. Baxter, 95-170 ; Glover v. Flowers, 101-134.
Recapitulation of evidence. —A judge is not bound to recapitulate all the
evidence to the jury. State v. Haney, 19-390 ; State v. Morris 10-388 ;
State v. O'Neal, 29-251; State v. Lipsey, 14-485.
The judge need not recapitulate the evidence when the parties waive
it. Wiseman v. Penland, 79-197 ; State v. Sykes, 79-618.
A judge should not recapitulate the evidence in full, but eliminate the
material facts, array the state of facts on both sides, and apply the prin
ciples of law to each, that the jury may decide the case according to the
credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. State v.
Jones, 87-547; State v. Moses, 13-457; State v. Jones, 97-469.
An omission to recapitulate evidence favorable to a party is not assign
able for error if not pointed out at the time. State v. Grady, 83-643.
It'is sufficient if the judge in charging the jury gives the substance
of the testimony of the witnesses. State v. Gould, 90-658.
The duty imposed upon judges by the act of 1796, to " state in a plain
and correct manner the evidence given in the case and declare aud
explain the law arising thereon," is mandatory. It may be dispensed
with in those cases where the evidence is not contradictory and the law
plain and also by consent. The duty, however, is not performed by
simply repeating the testimony in the order in which it was delivered,
or in a general statement of the principles of law applicable to the case;
but the judge should state clearly and distinctly the particular issues
arising in the controversy; eliminate the controverted facts; arraign the
testimony in its bearing on their different aspects, and instruct the jurv
as to the law applicable thereto in such manner as will enable them to
see and comprehend the matters which are essential to an intelligent
and impartial verdict. State v. Boyle, 104-800.
The judge is not bound to recapitulate all the evidence in his charge
to the jury; it is sufficient for him to direct the attention of the jury to
the principal questions they have to try, and explain the law applicable
thereto. State v. Pritchett, 106-667; State v. Brady, 107-822; Boon v.
Murphy, 108-187.
The judge should state clearly the issues and the law applicable thereto. —It
is the duty of the judge when he does charge upon evidence to collate
it and bring it together in one view, on each side, with such remarks
and illustrations, as may properly direct the attention of the jury. He
should also bring {o their notice principles of law or facts which have
an important bearing upon the case, though omitted in the argument of
counsel. Bailey v. Pool, 35-404.
he judge should put the case to the jury in such a way as to make it
appear by the record what facts the jury find, and what are his rulings
and charge as to the law, so that he may be reviewed. State v. Summey,
60-496.
When instructions are asked upon an assumed state of facts which
there is evidence tending to prove, and thus questions of law are raised
which are pertinent to the case, it is the duty of the judge to answer the
questions so presented, and to instruct the jury distinctly what the law
is, if they shall find the assumed state of facts to be true, and so in
respect to every state of facts which may be reasonably assumed upon
the evidence. State v. Dunlop, 65-288.
The judge should state clearly the issues and the law applicable to
each. State v. Matthews, 78-523.
If he fail to do so, it is ground for a new trial. State v. Dunlop, 65288.
In an action of ejectment, where a party relies upon two independent
sources of title, i. e., a thirty years' adverse possession and a seven yeafs'
one with color, it is error in the court to omit to explain the character,
nature and extent of the two kinds of possession, so as to enable the
jury to determine whether the acts of ownership come up to the require
ments of law. Logan v. Fitzgerald, 87-308.
Where the evidence is conflicting, the judge should leave the question
to the jury, with proper instructions on both aspects of the case. Lafoon
v. Shearin, 95-391; Morgan v. Lewis, 95-295 ; Brazil v. Railroad, 93-313.
The judge is not required by the act of 1796 (The Code, ((413! to
" charge " the jury where the facts at issue are few and simple, and no
principle of law is involved, unless he is requested to do so ; but in cases
where the witnesses are numerous, or the testimony conflicting or com
plicated, and different principles of law are applicable to different aspects
of the case, it is his duty to conform to the requirements of the statute.
Holly v. Holly, 94-96.
Although the trial judge lays down the law correctly in his charge, a
new trial will be given if the instructions are not applicable to the facts
of the case, and not warranted by the evidence. King v. Wells, 94-344.
While it may not be sufficient ground for a new trial, that the court
failed to give instructions to which the appellant might have been enti
tled if he had requested them, it is nevertheless the duty of the judge to
declare and explain the law arising upon the facts as they bear upon the
issues; and simply calling attention to the issues, without further instruc
tion, is error. Phifer v. Alexander, 97-335.
Where the evidence presents the case in two aspects, the trial judge
should charge the jury in both aspects of the case. Spence v. Clapp,
95-545 ; State v. Gilmer, 97-429; State v. Brewer, 98-607.
Where there is a conflict of testimony which leaves a case in doubt
l)efore the jury, and the judge uses language which may be subject to
misapprehension, and is calculated to mislead, the court will order a
venire tie novo. State v. Rogers. 93-523.
It is not error for the court to limit its charge to the facts as presented
bj- the evidence. The trial judge is not called on to present the case to
the jury in any aspect not presented by the pleadings or evidence Burwell v. Railroad, 94-451.
It is not error for the judge to direct the attention of the jury to the
contention of a party to the cause made in the argument of his counsel,
founded upon a calculation of an account alleged to be due, when that
fact grew out of the evidence introduced and was material to the contro
versy. Turner v. Turner, 104-566.
The judge should not incumber a case by an instruction to the jury
upon a hypothetical state of facts ; on the contrary, it is his duty to divest the issues, as far as practicable, of all irrelevant matter, and sub
mit only those aspects which are presented by the evidence. State v.
Wilson, 104-868.
The Code only requires the judge to "explain the law arising upon
the evidence." The misconception as to this founded upon State v.
Boyle, 104-800, corrected. State v. Brady, 107-S22.
It was not error for the court to charge that in certain aspects of the
case, specifying the aspects, the plaintiff might recover, where there
was evidence in support of them, especially as the aspects favorable to
defendant were likewise specified. Barringer v. Burns, 108-606.
Singling out witness. —It would be error in the trial judge to single out
the testimony of one witness, and charge the jury that if they believe
the testimony of that witness, they would find in accordance therewith,
when there are several witnesses who testify in regard to the same mat
ter. Weisenfield v. McLean, 96-248 ; State v. Rogers, 93-523.
While it is erroneous for the court, where the testimony is conflicting,
to single out one witness and make the case turn upon the truth of his
statement, without submitting the aspect presented by the other evi
dence ; yet if the conflicting statements are put side by side and the
jury instructed that if they believe the facts to be as testified by one of the
witnesses, they should so find, it is not error. State v. Weathers, 98-685.
Error corrected daring trial. — When a judge decides upon a question as
being one of law when it is one of fact, it is competent for him to cor
rect hid mistake and submit it to the jury. State v. May, 15-328.
Where a judge commits an error in excluding or admitting evidence,
it is his duty to correct it before the jury retire. Gilbert v. James, 86-244.
If a judge make a slip in a remark in presence of the jury, he can cor
rect it by proper instruction. State v. McNair, 93-628.
While the charge to the jury may be incorrect in part, a new trial will
not be granted if the trial judge in a subsequent part of the charge cor
rects it aud leaves the matters in controversy fairly to the jury. State v.
Keen, 95-646: Lewis v. Railroad, 95-179.
The judge's charge construed by the context. —The judge's charge must
be construed with reference to the context. State v. Boon, 82-637; State
v. Tilly, 25-424.
If the jury find an issue of law correctly, it cures the error of the judge. —
If a jury decide correctly a question of law, improperly left to them by
the court, the verdict cures the error of the court. Glenn v. Railroad,
63-510; Terry v. Railroad, 91-236; Moore v. Parker, 91-275.
What are the boundaries of a contract of laud, is a question of law.
But if the judge below leaves such question to the jury, and they find
the law as his Honor ought to have held, no advantage can be taken of
his Honor's charge. Johnson v. Ray, 72-273.
If the judge lays down the law incorrectly, but the jury find it prop
erly, the error is cured by the verdict. State v. Grady, 83-643.
The weight of evidence. —The weight of testimony is exclusively for the
jury to consider. Its nature, relevancy and tendency, it is the duty of
the judge to explain to them. State v. Moses, 13-452.
Error must be pointed out It is the duty of the appellant to show error,
and if the court cannot see from the record that a charge given to the
jury is erroneous, it will not grant a new trial. Deming v. Gainey,
95-528; Southerland v. Railroad, 106-100.
Nothing to the contrary appearing, it will be presumed the judge gave
the instructions properly applicable to the facts, as disclosed by the evi
dence. State v. Dickerson, 98-708.
Where the judge's charge involves a series of distinct propositions, the
errors alleged must be distinctly pointed out, or they will not be noticed.
Leak v. Covington, 99-559.
Immaterial error. —A charge which is in part erroneous, but which calls
the attention of the jury fairly to the material questions on which they
are to pass, is no ground for a new trial. Dills v. Hampton, 92-565.
A material instruction to the jury upon an immaterial issue will not
be considered material unless it prejudiced the action of the jury in
passing upon the other issues. Jones v. Call, 93-170.
An erroneous instruction to the jury upon an immaterial aspect of the
case, which does not appear to have misled the minds of the jury from
the real issue, is not sufficient ground for a new trial. Mitchell v. Hoggard, 10H-353; vState v. Gardner, 94-953.
Instructions should be upon the issues, and not generally. —A charge that if '
the jury believe a certain state of facts the plaintiff is not entitled to
recover, while it was proper upon the general issues submitted, under
the old practice, is confusing when applied to our present system. The
loose practice in this respect should be discontinued. McDonald v. Car
son, 94-497; Farrell V Railroad, 102-390.
No instruction, terminating in telling the jury the plaintiff cannot
recover, is in form to meet the issues of fact, nor should it be given.
Hardin v. Ledbetter, 103-90.
Charge not to be on a state of facts not established. —It is not error, for the
judge to refuse to charge upon a state of facts not established by the
evidence in the case. State v. Clara. 53-25; State v. Cain, 47-201; State
v. Rush, 34-3S2; State v. Hargett, 65-669; Wilson v. Holley, 66-407.
Charge should be on the whole case. —It is not the duty of the judge to
state the law on any selected fact, but to charge the law upon the whole
case. Wilson v. White, 80-280.
Charging an universally admitted proposition. — It is not error for the judge
to state to the jury a proposition which is universally admitted, and so
it is not error for him to say to them, that the testimony of a witness
who proved a good character, is entitled to more weight thau the testi
mony of one who has been shown to be of bad character. State v. Gay,
94-815.
Omission to charge. — A judge is not bound to charge on all the points
of a case. He may be silent as to a point, unless called upon by a party
to charge upon it. But it is error to pass over a preliminary point to
charge upon another which could not arise till the first point was dis
posed of. McNeill v. Massey, 10-91.
While in the absence of a prayer for instructions, the omission of a
judge to charge in a particular way is not assignable as error, yet if he
undertake to state the law, and omit an essential ingredient it is fatal.
State v. Austin, 79-624; Bynum v. Bynum, 33-632; State v. O'Neal,
29-251; State v. Johnson, 23-354; Pierce v. Alspaugh, 83-258.
The omission to call'the attention of the jury to the evidence brought
out by the cross-examination, is not error, where counsel did not call
the court's attention to it, and the jury were charged to base their ver
dict on all the evidence. State v. Reynolds, 87-544.
An omission of the judge to charge the jury upon a particular point
is not error unless asked to do so and this is not changed by The Code,
412(3). Terry v. Railroad, 91-236; Brown v. Calloway, 90-1 18; Fry v.
Currie, 91-436; Branton v. O'Briant. 93-99; King v. Blackwell, 96-322;
State v. Bailey, 100-528; Bethca v. Railroad, 106-279.
It is not error in the judge to omit to charge the jury upon matters
of law which can only arise upon the verdict, and have no bearing on
the questions to be considered by the jury. Dupree v. Insurance Co.,
92-417.
It is not error for a judge not to charge the jury upon a point which
counsel did not make at the trial. Thornburg v. Mastin, 93-258.
It is too late, after verdict, to except because the judge did not give
the jury instructions to which the party was entitled had he requested
them in apt time, or because the judge did not correctly recapitulate
the testimony. State v. Debnam, 98-712; State v. Nicholson, 85-549.
See \ 412 (3), ante, and cases cited.
Quantum of proof in equity cases.—A court will only correct a mistake
in a written instrument upon strong, clear and convincing proof, and it
is error to leave such issue to the jury to be found upon the preponder
ance of evidence. The jury should not find issues of fact in equitable
actions on less evidence than a chancellor would require. Ely v. Early,
94-1.
Under the present practice, where a party claims under a lost deed, it
is not error for the trial judge to charge the jury that the lost deed could
only be established by clear and satisfactory proof. Loftin v. Loftin,
96-94.
While a chancellor would require very strong evidence to rebut the
fact of marriage where the parties have lived together as man and wife,
and have generally been so reputed to be, after the death of one of them,
it is error for the judge to charge the jury that they must be governed
by this rule. Ferrall v. Broadway, 95-551.
The rules as to the quantum and quality of proof required in certain
classes of cases laid down in Harding v. Long, 103-1 ; Brown v. Mitchell,
102-347, and Ely v. Early, 94-1, will be adhered to without modification.
Berry v. Hall, 105-154.
What effect is to be given to testimony competent in law to establish
a fact must be left to the jury, but opinions of chancellors, when per
forming the functions of a jury, as well as a judge, upon particular states
of fact, must not be mistaken for rules of evidence and applied where
the facts in evidence before a jury are analogous. This cannot be done
without invading the province of the jury. Ibid.
If there be evidence tending to establish any fact that, if proven or
admitted, would raise the presumption that the transaction was fraudu
lent, as alleged, the trial judge may, of his own motion, and must, if
requested in apt time, or if it be essential to a proper understanding
of the application of the law to the testimony, instruct the jury as to its
weight; but he is not at liberty to say to the jury that any fact, proved
or admitted, that does not, in law, raise a presumption of the truth of
the allegation of fraud, is a strong cireumstance tending to establish it.
Ibid.
Interest. —A judge has no right to leave it to the jury to give the plain
tiff interest or not, as they may think proper. He should have instructed
them that if they found that the defendant owed the principal money
demanded, the plaintiff was entitled to interest from the time it was due.
Barlow v. Norfleet, 72-535.
See \\ 53° and 531, post, and cases cited.
Threat not to discharge jury. —Where the judge says to the jury, " It is
a plain case, and if you do not agree I will detain you till Saturday
night," it is a clear violation of this section. Nash v. Morton, 48-3.
It is not error to tell the jury that if they do not agree they will be
kept together till the end of the term. Hannon v. Grizzard, 89-115;
Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
Removal of jury. —The presiding judge may, when he thinks the inter
ests of justice require, direct that the jury be removed from the court
room while a proposition to introduce evidence involving a statement of
the matters proposed to be proved is being debated. Ordinarily, this is
a matter of discretion, but its exercise, under some circumstances, may
be subject to review upon appeal. State v. Moore, 104-743.
Charge not explicit. —A proposition of law given in a charge to the jury,
which is in terms too comprehensive or without its necessary limitations,
cannot be assigned for error if it be appropriate to the case and not cal
culated to mislead. McLeod v. Bullard, 86-210.
Where a judge deals in generalities, merely reading "head-notes" of
reported cases, without making any application of them to the facts of
the case, it is not a compliance with the statute. State v. Jones, 87-547.
In an action against physician for malpractice, the court charged the
jury that "ordinary skill " was the skill which a surgeon would, under
the circumstances of the case, reasonably use in treating the case, and
left the facts to the jury: Held, that the failure to give more explicit
instructions, in the absence of a prayer to that effect, w as not such error
as would warrant a new trial. Boon v. Murphy, 10S-1S7.

.Sec. 4 14. Judge to put his instructions in writing. C. C. P.,
8.2X8. 1885,c.l37.
Every judge, at the request of any party to an action on
trial, made at or before the close of the evidence, before
instructing the jury on the law, shall put his instructions
in writing and read them to the jury; he shall then sign
and file them with the clerk as a part of the record of the
action.
Ch. /J?, acts j8,8j :
Whenever a judge shall put his instructions to the jury
in writing, either of his own will or at the request of anyparty to an action on the trial, he shall, at the request of
either party to the action, allow the jury to take his
instructions with them on their retirement, and the jury
shall return said instructions with their verdict to the court.
If asked in apt time. —At the request of a party to the action, in apt
time, it is the duty of the judge to put his instructions in writing and
read them to the jury. But, where the oral instructions to the jury do
not differ from those set out in the written charge, exception to the oral
charge is not ground for a new trial. Currie v. Clark, 90-355.
When requested to do so in apt time, the judge must put in writing so
much of his charge as embodies principles of law, but he cannot be
forced to put the recapitulation of the evidence in writing. Dupree v.
When it appears from inspection of the record that the court below
refused to put its charge in writing, at the request of one of the parties
made in apt time, a new trial will be granted by the supreme court.
Drake v. Connelly, 107-463.
The charge must be put in writing if requested in apt time. Lowe v.
Elliott, 107-718.
Sec. 415. Counsel to put their prayers for instruction in
writing. C. C. P.,s

shall put their requests in writing entitled of the cause and
sign them ; otherwise the judge may disregard them ; they ,
shall be filed with the clerk as a part of the record.
Request to charge must be in writing, and at or before close of evidence.—
Prayers for instructions should be asked at the close of the evidence.
They can only be asked afterwards by leave of the court. Powell v.
Railroad, 68-395; Taylor v. Plummer, 105-56; Marsh v. Richardson,
106-548; Grubbs v. Insurance Co., io8-'472; Davis v. Council, 92-725;
State v. Rowe, 98-629.
Prayers for instruction must be in writing. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718;
Pleasants v. Railroad, 95-195.
A party only has the right to ask for special instructions before the
case is given to the jury, but if after the jury have retired, the court
should recall them and instruct them further, the defendant can except
if the charge is incorrect. State v. Barbee, 92-820.
It is too late to ask an instruction that there was no evidence to sus
tain a verdict on a certain issue after the verdict has been rendered.
Owens v. Phelps. 95-286.
If a party desires the entire testimony, or any specific part thereof,
recapitulated to the jury, he should make the request in apt time and
before verdict. Boon v. Murphy, 108-187.
Oral prayers for instructions. —The judge may disregard oral prayers for
special instructions. State v. Horton, 100-443.
Instructions need not be in the very words asked. —If a prayer for instruc
tion is given substantially in the charge, though not in the very words
asked, it is sufficient. Burton v. March, 51-409; State v. Brantley,
63-518; State v. Scott, 64-586; Brink v. Black, 77-59; State v. Boon,
82-637; State v. Hinson, 83-640; Patterson v. Mclver, 90-493; State v.

Railroad, 106-279; Everett v. Williamson, 107-204; Thompson v. Tele
graph Co., 107-449; State v. Brabham, 108-793.
A judge need not give the instructions in the very words asked, even
.w hen correct in law. But he shall declare the law as applicable to the
facts'in proof, and to any reasonable inference from them. ' Rencher v.
Wynne, 86-268.
A judge, in granting a prayer for certain instructions, may add thereto
any explanation as to the law bearing upon the facts embraced in the
instructions. Overcash v. Kitchie, 89-384.
The judge is not required to give instructions asked, and to which the
party is entitled, in the words cr in the order in which they are pre
sented; it is sufficient if they are substantially given. State v. Brewer,
98-607; State v. McNeil, 92-812; Newby v. Harrell, 99-149.
If the judge, while not giving a special instruction in the very words,
puts the defence raised therein distinctly to the jury, there is no cause
for complaint. Conwell v. Mann, 100-234.
Instructions properly refused. —It is not error in a judge to refuse to
charge abstract principles of law which have no application to the case.
State v. Speaks, 94-865; State v. Hunter, 94-829; Staton v. Mullis, 92623; State v. Jones, 97-469; Carpenter v. Tucker, 98-316; Leach v. Linde,
108-547; State v. Smith, 100-550.
It is not error for the judge to refuse to charge upon a hypothetical
case which does not appear in the evidence. State v. Anderson, 93-732;
Leak v. Covington, 99-559; State v. Lambert, 93-618.
It is not error for the court to refuse a prayer for instructions, not
warranted by any view of the evidence. State v. Starnes, 94-973; State
v. Gooch, 94-987.
It is not error for the court to refuse to charge the jury upon a point
not raised by the pleadings, and upon which there is no controversy.
Lewis v. Railroad, 95-179.
Where it was a disputed question in the case whether a mortgagor
lived in one county or the other, a prayer for instructions which assumes
that he resided in one of the counties, was properly refused. Weisenfield v. McLean, 96-248.
It is not error for the trial judge to refuse to charge that certain acts
or omissions of the plaintiff amount to contributory negligence, when
the evidence in regard to them is conflicting. Scott v. Railroad, 96-428.
It is not error for the trial judge to refuse to tell the jury that the
witness had testified to certain facts, when his notes do not show any
such testimony, and he has no recollection of it. It is entirely proper
for him to leave the matter to the jury to remember what the evidence
was. Spence v. Baxter, 95-170.
Where the evidence presents the case to the jury in two aspects, it is
not error in the trial judge to refuse a prayer for instructions, which
would present the case to the jury ouly in one aspect. Porter v. Rail
road, 97-46.
It is not the duty of the judge to charge the jury upon a single selected
fact, nor is he bound to charge in the language ask for in a special
instruction. Michael v. Foil, 100-178.
A prayer for instructions to the jury from the defendant that upon
the whole evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, is not proper
under the present system of practice. Now the jury do not find for the
one party or the other, as formerly, but respond to certain issues, and
upon their findings on these issues, the rights of the parties depend.
McDonald v. Carson, 94-497.
Instructions improperly refused. —When a party prays for instruction to
which he is entitled, it is error to refuse it. The court4 however, is not
required to adopt the words of the instruction asked, but it is error to
change its sense, or to so qualify it as to weaken its force. Brink v.
Black, 77-59.
Where a defendant asks a special instruction to the jury upon an aspect
of the case which is presented by the evidence, which the court does not
give, it is error, and entitles the defendant to a new trial. State v. Gaskins, 93-547Where, in an action against a telegraph company for damages for fail
ure to send a message in time, the court failed to instruct the jjiry, in
response to a prayer of defendant, whether or not they would be at lib
erty to give the plaintiff damages for mental suffering, unaccompa
nied by any other injury, or whether, if damages could not be assessed for that cause, the testimony tended to show any concomitant wrong to
the person : Held, to be error. Thompson v. Telegraph Co., 106-549.
It must appear that a proper prayer was granted.—When a party asks a
prayer for instruction, to which he is entitled, it must appear that it was
given either as asked or was substantially given in the charge, if the
appellant excepted to the refusal. McFarland v. Improvement Co.,
107-368.
A party cannot except, when. —A party cannot except to an instruction
asked by himself. Buie v. Buie, 24-87; Moore v. Parker, 91-275; Thomp
son v. Telegraph Co., 107-449; Greenleaf v. Railroad, 91-33.
Effect of certain prayers,—When the judge is requested to charge that
there is no evidence of a fact in issue, the evidence most favorable to
the opposite party must be considered alone, and if there is any evidence
at all to establish such fact the charge must be refused. State v. Home,
92-805.
Where a party asks the court to charge the jury that, if the other party
has not satisfied them by a preponderance of evidence, they should find
a certain way, it is an admission that there is some evidence to go to the
jury to prove the fact. Owens v. Phelps, 95-286.
Fuller or more specific instructions must be asked for, if desired. — On the
trial of an action, if either party desires fuller or more specific instructions
than the court has given, it is his duty to ask for them. Morgan v.
Smith. 77-37; King v. Blackwell, 96-322,
The trial judge is not required, in the absence of a prayer for special
instructions, to present the evidence in his charge in every possible
aspect. If the parties desire more specific instructions, they must ask
for them at the proper time. Morgan v. Lewis, 95-296 ; Boon v. Murphy,
108-187; Willey v. Railroad, 96-408, and cases there cited.
Refusal of prayer deemed excepted to. —The refusal or failure of the judge
to give an instruction specially prayed in writing, and in apt time, is
"deemed excepted to." McKinnou v. Morrison, 104-354; Taylor v.
Plummer, 105-56.
See \\ 409, 412 (3) and 413, ante.
Sec. 416. Trial by jury, how waived. C. C. P., s. 240.
Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties to an
issue of fact, in actions on contract, and with the assent of
the court in other actions in the manner following:
(1) By failing to appear at the trial ;
(2) By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed
with the clerk ;
(3) By oral consent, entered in the minutes.
Trial by jury, how waived. —There are three modes of waiving a jury
trial: 1, by default; 2, by written consent; and 3, by oral consent
entered on the minutes of the court.
When the record shows that a reference has been made, it imports
that every condition has been complied with, necessary to make it
effectual, and confers upon the court all the rights and duties conferred
upon a jury. In the exercise of this power the court below may revise
and correct its own findings, and to that end may invoke the aid of a
jury in matters of doubt and conflicting evidence, and it may direct a
jury to find either a general or special verdict, upon all or any of the
issues, or upon any particular questions of fact, all of which findings
shall be written and entered on the record. Armfield v. Brown, 70-27.
In injunction proceedings, if the allegations of the complaint are not
denied by the answer, it is not error for the judge to refuse to place the
cause on the docket for a jury trial. Hettrick v. Page, 82-65; Jones v.
Boyd, 80-258.
Demurrer to the evidence withdraws a cause from the jury. Nelson v.
Whitfield, 82-46.
A trial by jury is waived bv a reference by consent. Grant v. Reese,
82-72.
A reference to hear and determine all the matters in controversy, is a
waiver of a trial by jury. University v. Lassiter, S3-38.
After the transfer of the cause to the civil issue docket, an agreement
that the judge may find the facts, or, the facts being agreed, may pro
nounce judgment, cures all irregularities. Foreman v. Hough, 98-386.
See \ 398, ante, and cases cited.
Waiver, by whom. —The consent to waive a jury trial may be made by
counsel without special authority. Stevenson v. Felton, 99-58.
It is competent for the attorney and guardian ad litem to waive a jury
trial for infants, even where they have not been regularly served with
summons. White v. Morris, 107-92.
Where parties agree to a particular mode of trial, they are bound by it.
Runuion v. Ramsay, 93-410.
Where, by consent, the court tries the issues of feet. —When the parties
consent that the court may try issues of fact, it confers upon the judge
all the rights and duties of a jury. He may revise and correct his own
findings and invoke the aid of a jury, and may direct a general or special
verdict upon all or any issues or upon any question of fact, all of which
findings shall be written and entered of record. Armfield v. Brown,
70-27.
Where a jury is waived, and the judge tries the facts, errors committed
by him in the reception or rejection of evidence are reviewable upon
appeal. The admission of irrelevant testimony is not ground for a new
trial if it is apparent that it was harmless. Puffer v. Baker, 104-148.
When a trial by jury is waived, the court should find the facts and
state its conclusion separately, in writing, and then enter judgment in
accordance therewith. But, where the court simply responded formally
to the issues, and directed judgment, to which no exception was taken
and no assignment of error was made, the judgment will be affirmed.
Parks v. Davis, 98-481.
Where a trial by jury having been waived, the court adopted the find
ings of fact and conclusions of law of a referee to whom the case had
been referred by consent, and also responded to issues framed by itself,
while this was not a formal compliance with the statute, yet, if from the
record it can be seen what facts were found and what conclusions the
court made thereon, the judgment will be affirmed. Silver Valley Co. v.
Baltimore Smelting Co., 99-445.
If the judge finds the facts, and there be no objection, it must be pre
sumed it was with consent of all parties. White v. Morris, 107-92.
Judge can only pass upon issues of fact when a jury trial is waived. —When
an issue of fact is raised, involving the merits of the controversy, and
the defendant, in apt time, demands a jury to try that fact, it is error in
the presiding judge to refuse such demand and try the issue himself.
Isler v. Murphy, 71-436.
The judge can only pass upon issues of fact when a jurv trial is
waived as required by this section. Chastain v. Martin, 81-51; Leggett
Where issues of fact are raised by the pleadings, it is error for the
judge to decide the action without submitting these issues to a jury,
unless both sides consent that he shall decide the whole case, both on
the law and the facts. Wilson v. Bynuni, 92-717.
Findings reviewed, when. —The findings and conclusions of the judge,
in a case under this section, will not be reviewed except on exceptions
aptly taken, or when error is distinctly pointed out. Chastain v. Cow
ard. 79-543The supreme court will not review the finding of the court below on the
ground that it was against the weight of the testimony. Under this
section, such finding is conclusive as to issues of fact, subject only to
the exception (1) that there was no evidence to support it; (2) that incom
petent evidence was admitted; (3) that some material fact was left out
of consideration. Fertilizer Co. v. Reams, 105-283; Branton v. O'Briant,
93-99Hew trial, if granted, must be by a jury, unless again waived. —Where a
trial by jury is waived, and the facts and the law are found by the judge,
and his conclusions of law are reversed on appeal, the.court below can
not proceed to judgment on the facts found in the first trial, but the
case must be submitted to a jury, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
Isler v. Koonce, 83-55; Benbow v. Robbins, 72-422.
Sec. 417. On trial bg the court, judgment, how to be given.
V. C. P., 8. 241.
Upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, its
decision shall be given in writing, and shall contain a
statement of the facts found, and the conclusions of law,
separately; and, upon a trial of an issue of law, the decision
shall be made in the same manner, stating the conclusions
of law. Such decision shall be filed with the clerk during
the court at which the trial takes place. Judgment upon
the decision shall be entered accordingly.
Findings of fact final. —The finding of the court upon such questions of
fact is final. McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
The findings of the judge of the superior court on questions of fact
properly submitted to his decision in a cause of purely legal cognizance
are as inviolable as the verdict of a jury, and cannot be reversed on
appeal. Greensboro v. Scott, 84-184; Burke v. Turner, 85-500.
Findings of fact by the judge are reviewable only in equity cases.
Jones v. Boyd, 80-258.
Findings on mixed questions of fact and law. —A judge of the superior
court, in passing upon a mixed question of law and fact, should state
the facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately. Fourshee v.
Pattershall, 67-453.
The power of the supreme court to review such mixed questions of
law and fact, decided by the judge below, is also argued at considerable
length, by Rodman, J., in the above case. See, also, Heilig v. Stokes,
63-612, and Clegg v. White Soapstone, Co., 66-391.
Facts not fully fonnd.—If the facts are not found fully by the judge, to
whom a case is referred under this section, so that his conclusions of
law can be reviewed on appeal, the. case will be remanded. Straus v.
Beardsley, 79~59Called to the attention of the snperior comrt judges. —The requirements of
this section arc called by the court to the attention of the judges of the
superior court. Jacobs v. Burgwyn, 63-196.
This section not applicable. —This section is not applicable to a motion to
vacate a warrant of attachment. Millhiser v. Balsley, 106-433.
NoTii. —Section 416 applies to findings by the court upon issues of
fact when a jury is waived. This section applies to findings of ques
tions of fact, other, however, than the incidental questions of fact aris
ing upon provisional remedies.
Sec. 418. Exceptions, how and when taken. C. C. P., s.
242.
(1) For the purposes of an appeal, either part}' may except
to a decision on a matter of law arising upon such trial
within ten days after the judgment, in the same manner
and with the same effect as upon a trial by jury : Pro
vided, that where the decision does not authorize a final
judgment, but directs further proceedings before a referee
or otherwise, either party may except thereto, and make a
case or exception as above provided in case of an appeal.
(2) And either party desiring a review, upon the evi
dence appearing on the trial of the questions of law, may
at any time within ten days after the judgment, or within
such time as may be prescribed by the rules of the court,
make a case or exceptions in like manner as upon a trial
by jury> except that the judge, in settling the case must
briefly specify the facts found by him, and his conclusions
of law.
Exceptions must be distinctly set out.—Exceptions taken tnust be dis
tinctly set out, together with the facts upon which they depend. Meekins v. Tatem, 79-546; Williamson v. Canal Co., 78-156.
Too late to except. —After the filing of a referee's report, it was agreed
that the cause should be tried by the court, without a jury, upon the
evidence taken and returned by the referee, and it was so tried and
determined, the court adopting some of the referee's findings : Held,
that it was then too late to object that the referee had exceeded the
scope of his authority under the order of reference; nor could the
objections taken to the reception and rejection of evidence before the
referee be insisted upon, unless they had been made again on the hear
ing before the court. Silver Valley Co. v. Baltimore Smelting Co.,
99-445The poii t that there is no evidence to support the findings of fact
made or adopted by the judge below, must be made by exception filed
and called to the attention of the judge during the term, in analogy to
a motion for a new trial. An exception based on such grounds, filed
after the term, under Rule 27, will not be considered in the supreme
court ; although the exception, that there is no evidence, elc., is one
which the court will pass upon if made in apt time. Battle v. Mayo,
102-413.
Findings on issues of fact.—The findings of fact by the judge, when he
is authorized by law or the consent of parties to pass upon them, is
as conclusive as the verdict of a jury upon issues submitted, if there be
evidence ; if there be no evidence, it is an error in law, open to correc
tion in either case, to find them. Branton v. O'Briant, 93-99.
Where, in a suit instituted in the late court of equity, and transferred
to the superior court docket under the provisions of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, the parties agreed that the judge should find the facts, and that
he should examine witnesses orally, and only the substance of the oral
evidence was sent up with the record, the right to have the findings of fact
reviewed by the supreme court is waived. Runnion v. Ramsay, 93-410.
Findings on questions of fact. —The findings of fact by the judge on ques
tions of fact in a cause of purely legal cognizance, are final, and not sub
ject to exceptions. Burke v. Turner, 85-500; Greensboro v. Scott,
84-184; McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
material fact not found.—Where the case is left by consent to be tried, both
as to the facts and the law by the judge, and he fails to find some material
tact, it will be remanded, in order that such may be found. Knott v.
Taylor, 96-553.
Attention of bar called to this section by the court. —The attention of the
bar is called to this section by the court. Jacobs v. Burgwyn, 63-196.
Officers not entitled to costs, when. —Officers neglecting these provisions
of The Code are not entitled to costs. Jacobs v. Burgwyn, 63-196; Fourshee v. Pattershall, 67-453; Green v. Castleberry, 70-20.
Sec. 419. Proceedings upon Judgment on issue of law. C.
C. P., s. 243.
On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an issue of law, the
plaintiff may proceed in the manner prescribed by the first
two subdivisions of section three hundred and eighty-five,
upon failure of the defendant to answer, where the summons
was personally served. If judgment be for the defendant
upon an issue of law, and if taking of an account or the proof
of any fact be necessary to enable the court to complete
the judgment, a reference or assessment by jury may be
ordered, as provided in section three hundred and eightysix.
Sec. 420, All issues referable by consent. C. C. P., s. 244.
All, or any, of the issues in the action, whether of fact
or of law, or both, may be referred, upon the written consent
of the parties, except in actions to annul a marriage, or for
divorce and separation.
Reference by consent. — A reference by consent is a waiver of the right
to a jury trial. Klutts v. McKenzie, 65-102; Green v. Castleberry,
70-20; Arrnfield v. Brown, 70-27; Lippard v. Roseman, 70-34; Keener
v. Finger, 70-35; Lippard v. Roseman, 72-427; Perry v. Tupper, 77-413;
Atkinson v. Whitehead, 77-418; Britt v. Benton, 79-177; Overby v. Fayetteville, 8r-56; Grant v. Reese, 82-72.
A reference not excepted to is a reference by consent, and neither
party is entitled to a jury. Nissen v. Mining Co., 104-309; Grant v.
Hughes, 96-177; Harris v. Shaffer, 92-30; Rogers v. Bank, 108-574; Armfield v. Brown, 70-27; White v. Utley, 86-415; Atkinson v. Whitehead,
77-41S; Smith v. Hicks, 108-248.
A consent reference does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to make
orders. The action is not referred. McNeill v. Lawton, 97-16.
Where the order of reference was as follows, " In this cause the order
of reference heretofore made herein having been mislaid, it is agreed
between the parties that D. C, clerk of this court, proceed to take and
state an account," and "if not found, that an order be made as of the
last term by consent according," makes a reference by consent. Vaughan
v. Lewellyn, 94-472.
It is proper that the agreement to refer should specify in terms the
"issues of law and fact" ; but where the purpose is obvious, the strict
words of the statute will not be required. Morrisey v. Swinson, 104-555.
Reference by consent cannot be recalled. —A reference, by consent, cannot
be discontinued by the court at its discretion, nor vacated at the demand
of one of the parties. It may terminate by the death of the referee, or
the judge may remove him, for good cause shown, but not otherwise.
Perry v Tupper, 77-413; Stevenson v. Felton, 99-58; Patrick v. Railroad,
101-602; Smith v. Hicks, 108-248.
The consent of a party once given to a reference cannot be recalled.
Flemming v. Roberts, 77-415; White v. Utley, 86-415; Morrisey v. Swin
son, 104-555.
Entry of order sufficient. —An order of reference by consent entered of
record is a sufficient compliance with the statute requiring the same to
be in writing. White v. Utley, 86-415.
Too late to object, when.—When a case is referred without the written
consent of the parties as required by this section, and both parties appear
before the referee and examine testimony, and the report is afterwards
made and confirmed in the superior court, aud a judgment given upon
it, from which an appeal is taken to the supreme court, it is too late to
object in that court to the order of reference as having been improperly
made in the superior court. Johnston v. Haynes, 68-509.
Issues should be raised before reference. —A reference ought not to be
ordered before issues are raised between the parties to the cause. Syme
v. Bunting, 86-175.
Scope of the reference.—On a consent reference the question as to whether
all the issues raised by the pleadings are to be considered, depends upon
the agreement of the parties, and the finding of the judge below is final
and not reviewable. Barrett v. Henry, 85-321.
Pleading after reference. —Under an order of reference by consent, con
taining directions to the referee to ascertain what sums the clerk and
master had received, when received, and a further provision that " his
decision of the law is open to revision in this and other courts having
jurisdiction," it is competent for the defendant to set up the presump
tion of payment from lapse of time, notwithstanding no answer was filed.
Kerlee v. Corpening, 97-330.
^
Reference to state an account. —In an action for account and settlement
of a partnership, where the defendant admitted the partnership, but
alleged a full settlement, with specified exceptions, the settlement must
be taken to be denied, and it is error to grant an order of reference to
take an account before the trial of issues raised by the pleadings. Price
v. Eccles, 73-162.
It is irregular to proceed with a reference to state an account while
there are matters of defence left open which, if sustained, will bar the
claim to have an account. Sloan v. McMahon, 85-296; Railroad v. Mor
rison, 82-141; Com'rs v. Magnin, 85-114.
When it is admitted, or proved, that there came into the hands of the
administrator assets of the estate, it is proper to order a reference to
state an account of his administration, unless some defence is interposed
which bars the right to such account. Neal v. Becknell, 85-299.
Distinction between a reference to state an account preparatory to a
trial, and the trial of a cause by a referee under The Code, pointed out.
Arbitration and award.—If a suit be referred by an entry on the docket
in these words, viz., "this case is referred to A. B., who shall summon
the parties before him and hear the case, and his award shall be a rule
of court," and the referee files a paper which he styles an award, whether
it is to be treated as an award under a rule, or a reference under this sec
tion, the referee's finding of the facts is equally conclusive, as are also
his conclusions as to the law arising on the facts, except, probably,
where he undertakes to make the case turn upon a question of law, and
clearly mistakes it. Gudger v. Baird, 66-438.
The effect of a reference to arbitrators is very different from that of a
reference under The Code. Arbitrators may choose an umpire ; they are
not bound to find the facts separately from their conclusions of law ;
they are not bound to decide according to law ; and their award may be
general. Lusk v. Clayton, 70-184; Keener v. Goodson, 89-278.
But if the arbitrators attempt to decide according to law and err, their
finding is reviewable. King v. Neuse Mfg. Co., 79-360; Miller v. Bryan,
86-167.
Submission to arbitration and an award constitutes an executory agree
ment, and certainty to a common intent is all that is required in the
award to admit its specific enforcement. Crawford v. Orr, 84-246.
In the absence of impeaching allegations upon the production of an
award (where the cause is referred to arbitration) the successful party is
entitled to demand judgment thereon. Moore v. Austin, 85-179.
Distinction between a reference to arbitrators and a reference under
The Code noted by Ashe, J. Keener v. Goodson, 89-273.
Unless a submission to arbitration is made under an order of the court,
the award cannot be made a judgment of the court, except by consent.
Love v. Fitzgerald, 97-39.
Nor can such be treated as a reference. Jackson v. McLean, 96-474.
A reference was made to two arbitrators, with a provision in the order
for the substitution of alternates in the event the original referees, or
either of them, could not serve. One of them declined, and the alter
nate for him, vainly trying to secure a meeting with the other, also
refused to serve. This was good cause for the court to vacate the order.
Patrick v. Railroad, 101-602.
Where the submission to arbitration was under seal, and conferred
upon the arbitrators therein named authority to call in a third party in
case they could not agree, the selection of such third party before any
disagreement, and his participation in the award, did not vitiate it, and
it was not necessary that his appointment should be under seal. Bryan
v. Jeffreys, 104-242.
*
Where one of the parties to an arbitration has performed a part of the
award, he is estopped from afterwards assailing it because it transcended
the scope of the agreement upon which it was based. Ibid.
The fact that arbitrators included in their award a sum not in dispute,
but which was the basis of the disputed transaction, and without which
the award would have been incomplete, will not make it void, and
especially so when the agreement to refer submitted the question "of
the amounts and sums due betweeti " the parties." Ibid.
Where the defendant pleads, in bar of an action, that the whole cause
of action alleged in the complaint has been the subject of arbitration
and the award performed, and also alleges in his answer that he never
had notice of plaintiff's claim until after the arbitration, the answer
does not admit that the plaintiff's claim had not been submitted to the
arbitrators, and it is competent for defendant to prove that it had been
considered and was embraced in the award. Cheatham v. Rowland,
105-218.
See \ 422, post, and cases cited.
Note. —Where three commissioners are appointed to partition land,
as prescribed by f) 1892 of The Code, the action of any two of them is
valid. Thompson v. Shemwell, 93-222.
But this does not apply to referees or arbitrators. Oakley v. Anderson,
93-108.
See \ 422, post, and cases cited.
Sec. 421. When reference may be compulsorily ordered.
C. C. P., s. 245.
Where the parties do not consent, the court may, upon
the application of either, or of its own motion, except where
the investigation will require the decision of difficult ques
tions of law, direct a reference in the following cases:
(r) Where the trial of an issue of fact shall require the
examination of a long account on either side, in which case
the referee may be directed to hear and decide the whole
issue, or to report upon any specific question of fact involved
therein; or,
Compulsory reference cannot be ordered, when. —Under ^420 and 421, a
compulsory reference cannot be ordered by the court in a suit on a judg
ment confessed by the defendants as executors before the late civil war,
where the only matters of defence are payments made by them in Con
federate currency during the war, and alleged counterclaims for notes
due from the plaintiffs to them as executors. Such a case does not
require "the examination of a long account on either side," nor is the
"taking of an account necessary for the information of the court."
Hall v. Craige, 65-51.
The Constitution guarantees the right of trial by jury to everyone, and
no one can be deprived of it except by his consent. Bernheim v. War
ing, 79-56. •
Probate court cannot refer. —The probate court has not a general juris
diction as the superior court has, and the power to refer is not only
given to the superior court by this section, but by the usage of all courts
of general jurisdiction from the earliest times. Rowland v. Thompson,
65-1 10.
Distinction between a reference to try a cause and a reference to state an
account. —Distinction between a reference to state an account preparatory
to trial, and the trial of a cause by a referee, under The Code, pointed
out. Barrett v. Henry, 85-321.
Referee to report in sixty days. —The provision in \ 423, that if the referees
fail to deliver a report within sixty days from the time the action shall
be finally submitted, either party may end the reference, applies only to
cases in which the reference is by consent, and not compulsory under
this section, or, at least, it does not apply to a reference to take an
administration account made bv order of the court. Maxwell v. Max
well, 67-383.
By " finally submitted " is not to be understood the order of reference
or ceasing to take testimony, but when the parties have made their
arguments, or declined to do so, or when they have told the referees
that the case was submitted, /bid.
NOTE.—The sixty-days limitation is now stricken out of I 423.
Reference upon sham or immaterial issues. —Where a reference was made,
and the referee reported that the defendant had made payments exceed
ing his indebtedness for the land, and exceptions were filed and sustained
on the ground that the items allowed were barred by the statute: Held,
that there was a misconception of the issue, or the issue was made imma
terial. Eubanks v. Mitchell, 67-34.
A reference of issues upon sham pleas is erroneous, but, if the refer
ence embrace an issue on a good plea, which may be referred, it will be
sustained as to that, while it is reversed as to the others. Flack v. Daw
son, 69-42.
When a reference should not be ordered. — A reference should not be ordered
while there are matters of defence left open, which, if sustained, will bar
the necessity of a reference. Railroad v. Morrison, 82-141; Cox v. Cox,
S4-138; Sloan v. McMahon, 85-296; Neal v. Becknall, 85-299; Commis
sioners v. Magnin, 85-114; Commissioners v. Raleigh, 88-120; Douglas
v. Caldwell, 64-372; Price v. Eccles, 73-162; Humble v. Mebane, 89-410.
It is not error to refuse a compulsory reference, when the motion to
refer is not made until after the close of the evidence. Hughes v. Boone,
102-137.
Reference to find specific facts. —The refusal of a judge to ordera reference
for the purpose of taking testimony upon matters of equity addressed to
him, after issues have been submitted to a jury, and a reference has
been made in regard to other matters, cannot be assigned as error, as it
is a matter addressed to his discretion. Fortune v. Watkins, 94-304.
(2) Where the taking of an account shall be necessary
for the information of the court, before judgment, or for
carrying a judgment order into effect ; or,
Action against administrators and executors.—Debts against deceased per
sons must be sued for by civil action against the personal representative,
and the summons must be returnable to a regular term of the superior
court; if the defendant denies the debt, but admits assets, the question of
debt or no debt, must be tried in the ordinary way; if the defendant, by
his answer, denies the debt, and also denies that he has assets applica
ble to the debt, then the debt being first established, an interlocutory
order should be made, declaring that fact, and directing a reference,
under this section, to ascertain the amount of the debts (and their sev
eral classes, in respect to administrations since July 1st, 1869, acts of
i869-'7o, chap. 58), and the amount of the assets from all sources. Upon
the coming in of the report, after disposing of exceptions, a final judg
ment will be entered in favor of all creditors, respectively, who have
proved their debts, to the part of the fund to which they may be sev
erally entitled, for which executions may issue " de bonis propriis," as
upon a claim in equity. Heilig v. Foard, 64-710.
The superior court, in term, has incidental jurisdiction to order the
taking of an account of the administration, where necessary for adjust
ing the rights of the parties to any action therein pending. Rountree
v. Britt, 94-104.
Where an administrator pleaded a final account, taken ex parte by
the probate judge, in bar of an action by the next of kin, but the answer was vague and indefinite, and contained unsatisfactory statements in
regard to the administrator's dealings with the estate: It was held, that
it was proper to order a reference to restate the administration account.
Grant v. Hughes, 94-231.
Compulsory reference can be made to state an account, when. —Where the
facts connected with the management of a trust estate are in dispute,
and the rights of the parties cannot be readily ascertained without an
account, in such case the rule adopted by courts of equity is a reference
to the master, and if there is dissatisfaction with the report the matter
may be brought before the court by proper exceptions. Martin v. Wilborne, 66-321.
Where the object of the action is to have the defendant declared a
trustee, and the statement of his account as executor is necessary to
determine his liability as such, the superior court has power to order a
reference to take an account. Cain v. Nicholson, 77-411.
In an action to impeach a former decree, brought by a guardian, a
reference maybe ordered to ascertain alleged expenditures for benefit of
ward before judgment. Sutton v. Schonwald, 80-20.
A compulsory reference is proper to have an account stated. Com
missioners v. Magnin, 85-114; Chalk v. Bank, 87-200.
A compulsory reference may be ordered where the taking of an account
shall be necessary for the information of the court before judgment.
Leak v. Covington, 87-501.
In a case involving the settlement of a complicated account, $$421
and 422 require that it be referred to referees to state an account, and
objections to their report must be made by way of exceptions to it, and
neither party has the right to require the facts to be passed upon by a
jury. Klutts v. McKenzie, 65-102. This case is overruled by Green v.
Castleberry, 70-20; Armfield v. Brown, 70-27; Keener v. Finger, 70-35;
Atkinson v. Whitehead, 77-418, and other cases cited under ^398, 416
and 420, ante.
Where one is entitled to an account, or his right thereto is admitted,
the court will order it taken before a trial on the issues. Albright v.
Albright, 91-220.
Where a defendant is shown to be liable to account, a reference fol
lows as a matter of course, unless some plea in bar is set up, as a release,
etc. Grant v. Hughes, 94-755.
Qiurrc, whether there can be a compulsory reference as to damages
on his injunction bond? Gold Co. v. Ore Co., 79-48.
Reference to stite an account will not be ordered, when.—Where the statute
of limitations is pleaded, it should be passed upon before a reference is
ordered to state an account. Cox v. Cox, 84-138.
A reference to take an account is irregular where a defence is set up
to the entire action, and the allegations of fact, if found to lie true, would
defeat the plaintiff's recovery, and in such case the court should direct
the issues to be tried; but otherwise, where the defence relied on is no
obstacle to the recovery. Humble v, Mebane, 89-410; Grant v. Hughes,
96-177.
See cases cited under §420, and the preceding sub-section of this
section.
To find specific facts. —Under the present practice, a reference will not be
ordered after a final decree to ascertain any facts taking place after
judgment. White v. Butcher, 97-7; Pearson v. Carr, 97-194.
Under the former equity practice, in a suit for specific performance, a
referee was ordered before the final decree to ascertain the balance due on the purchase-money, but not to afford affirmative relief to the defend
ant. White v. Butcher, 97-7.
If objection to reference is not made at the time. —An order of reference
to take a partnership account will not be reversed because made before
the existence of the partnership has been established, when no excep
tion was taken at the time the reference was ordered. McPeters v.
Ray, 85-462.
Cannot be ended by notice given. —A reference made by the court to take
an account to be used in an action pending before it, is not such a refer
ence as can be ended at the election of either party upon the notice pre
scribed in §423. Green v. Green, 69-294.
Note. —The proviso allowing the reference to be terminated upon
notice is stricken out of \ 423.
(3) When the case involves a complicated question of
boundary, or one which requires a personal view of the
premises ;
(4) Where a question of fact other than upon the plead
ings shall arise, upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of
the action. But the compulsory reference under this sec
tion shall not deprive either party of his right to a trial of
the issues of fact arising on the pleadings by a jury.
Either party entitled to a jury trial, when. —Where there is a compulsory
reference either party is entitled to a jury trial if demanded in apt time,
otherwise it is waived. Armfield v, Brown, 70-27; Green v. Csstleberry,
70-20; Keener v. Finger, 70-35; Atkinson v. Whitehead, 77-418.
It is doubtful if the court has power to allow the parties by agreement
to submit exceptions to a referee's report to a trial by jury when the
reference was by consent. If the order of reference contains a provi
sion that either party may demand a trial by jury on the exceptions to
the report, if entitled to a jury trial at all, it must be demanded when
the exceptions are filed. Harris v. Shaffer, 92-30.
Where a referee is by consent, the parties waive the right to have any
of the issues of fact passed on by a jury. Where the reference is compul
sory, the excepting party has the right to have all issues offact which
arise on the pleadings, submitted to a jury, but not the questions of fact
which arise on exceptions to the findings of fact by the referee. Grant
v. Hughes, 96-177; Carr v. Askew, 94-194.
Either party to a compulsory reference has a constitutional right to
have any issue of fact, which was or ought to have been passed upon by
the referee, submitted to a trial by jury; but to avail himself of this
right he should, by exceptions made in apt time, distinctly designate
the controverted facts that he demands shall thus be determined. Yelverton v, Coley, 101-248.
See cases cited under \\ 39S, 416 and 420, ante.
#
Fees of referee, how taxed,—The referee's fees, in the absence of agree
ment, must be taxed against the losing party. The court cannot order
one-half thereof to be paid by each party. Wall v. Covington, 76-150.
Note. —This is now left in the discretion of the court. Ch. 37, acts
1S89.
Sec. 422. Mode of trial ; effect of report ; review. C. CP.,
s. 246.
The trial by referees shall be conducted in the same
manner as a trial by the court. They shall have the same
power to grant adjournments and to allow amendments to
any pleadings, and to the summons, as the court, upon
such trial, upon the same terms and with like effect They
shall have the same power to preserve order and punish all
violations thereof upon such trial, and to compel the attend
ance of witnesses before them by attachment, and to punish
them as for contempt for non-attendance or refusal to be
sworn or testify, as is possessed by the court. They must
state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately,
and their decision must be given, and may be excepted to
and reviewed in like manner and with like effect in all
respects as in cases of appeal, and they may in like manner
settle a case on exceptions. The report of the referees
upon the whole issue shall stand as the decision of the
court, and judgment may be entered thereon upon appli
cation to the judge. When the reference is to report the
facts, the report shall have the effect of a special verdict.
Powers of referee. —A referee has power to enforce obedience to his
rulings on the trial of the issues before him, just as the court would
have upon the trial before it. But a reference under supplementary
proceedings to take testimony is not a trial, and the referee therein can
not punish a witness in refusing to answer questions, and such witness
must be reported to and punished by the court making the reference.
La Fontaine v. Southern Underwriters, 83-132.
A referee has power to make new parties to the action. Perkins v.
Berry, 103-131.
' Referee's report and its requisites. —In a reference to take an account, the
referee should state distinctly and separately his conclusions as to law
and fact. Klutts v. McKenzie, 65-102.
It is the duty of the referee to state positively and distinctly all the
facts constituting the ground of defence, and not leave to inference what
is the precise fact intended to be found. Conclusions of law and fact
must be separately stated. Earp v. Richardson, 75-84.
A report of a referee that does not state all the items of the account
between the parties will be set aside for vagueness. McCampbell v.
McClung, 75-393The evidence in writing upon which facts are found by a referee should
accompany his report. Cain v. Nicholson, 77-411.
Where, by the terms of a reference, the referee's findings of fact are
to be conclusive, it is not necessary to send up all the evidence taken,
but only so much as relates to findings excepted to as wanting the sup
port of any evidence, or as resulting from the rejection of proper evi
dence, or the reception of improper evidence against objection in apt
time. In such cases the exception should set forth the evidence received
or rejected, or the facts found without evidence. Morrison v. Baker,
81-76.
A referee should report in writing all the testimony taken "by him, and
file copies of all documents adduced in evidence and considered by him.
Commissioners v. Magnin, 85-114.
Referees should exercise their own judgment in stating an account,
and not merely adopt an account stated by other parties. The items
should be given in detail, and not simply the result of an adjustment.
Ibid.
When exception is made to the referee's failure to report evidence, it
may be ordered to be produced if it has been preserved in writing, but
if it has not been preserved, a recommittal of the report is necessary.
Ibid.
Where the report of a referee in the statement of an account does not
conform to the order of reference, the court will set it aside, with instruc
tions to observe strictly, in re-stating the account, the method pointed
out in the order of the court. Burke v. Turner, 89-246.
Where the report of a referee designates certain claims which he finds
to be valid against the defendant as claims of "officers of the court,"
such designation sufficiently points out the clerk to whom payment is to
be made. Perkins v. Berry, 103-131.
When the referee to whom the case was referred, under The Code,
failed to find the facts upon which the plea of statute of limitation can
be determined, the case must be remanded. Lanning v. Commissioners,
106-505.
Findings of fact. —The referee's findings of fact are equally conclusive
with those of an arbitrator. Gudger v. Baird, 66-438.
The findings of fact in a referee's report are presumed to be right
unless shown to be wrong. Green v. Jones, 78-265.
The report of a referee, under The Code, is not in the nature of a
special verdict and conclusive as to facts, but is reviewable on excep
tions. Lawrence v. Hyman, 79-209.
Where the report does not state fully the findings of fact, so the con
clusions of law thereon may be reviewed, the case must be remanded.
Norment v. Brown, 79-363.
Where there is a consent reference, with full power in the referee to
determine the case upon the law and facts, the facts found by the referee
are not reviewable. Hanner v. McAdoo, 86-370.
«
In an action at law, the supreme court cannot look into the evidence
to see what facts it warranted the referee in finding. Patterson v. Wadsworth, 89-407.
The findings of fact by a referee are conclusive unless excepted to.
If, upon exception, they are adopted by the court, such findings are
conclusive unless found without evidence or upon improper evidence.
Usry v. Suit, 91-406; Depriest v. Patterson, 92-399; Strauss v. Frederick,
98-60; Jordan v. Bryan, 103-59; Cooper v. Middleton, 94-86.
Allegations in a complaint, not denied in the answer, are sufficient
basis for the referee's findings of fact; but allegations not so admitted,
and not sustained by proof, are not evidence, unless put in evidence.
Stephenson v. Felton 105-114.
Action of the court on the report. —Sections 420 and 421 are to be con
strued and collated with \ 18 of art. 4 of the constitution, from which it
will be seen that a trial by reference is only ancillary to the trial by the
court, and the finding of the referee, when reviewed and corrected pur
suant to ^422 and 423, becomes the judgment of the court. Arinfield
,v. Brown, 70-27.
Where, on exceptions to a referee's report, the judge does not find
any facts, but overrules all the exceptions to a report, he is presumed to
have adopted the findings of the referee. Barbee v. Green, 92-471.
Where exceptions to the report of a referee are passed upon by a judge
of the superior court, such exceptions cannot be reheard by another
judge of that court. The matter is res judicata. Scroggs v. Stevenson,
100-354.
Upon exceptions to the finding of fact by a referee, under a consent
reference, the court may review such finding and overrule or modify it;
but it is error to submit an issue thereon to a jury as a matter of right
to the party excepting. Smith v. Hicks, 108-248.
Referee's report, how reviewed.—The report of a referee is reviewed, not
by an appeal, but by exceptions taken to the report. Green v. Castleberry, 79-20.
The point that a referee has not found the facts upon which he bases
his report, must be taken by a motion to recommit, and not by excep
tion to the report. Scroggs v. Stevensoxi, 100-354.
Issues of fact raised by exception to referee's report.—It is not the duty of
a judge, in passing on exceptions, to decide all questions of fact with
out a jury. On the contrary, if the facts depend upon doubtful and
conflicting testimony, he may cause issues to be framed, and submitted
to a jury for information. Maxwell v. Maxwell, 67-383.
The judge may submit issues of fact raised by exceptions to a referee's
report, to a jury. Gold Company v. Ore Compary, 79-48.
Exceptions to report. —If no exception is made before a referee and
his report is returned to the term, the parties must be allowed to except
then. And when a report is filed under a compulsory reference and
exceptions made thereto, either party has the right to have the issues
thus made tried by a jury. Green v. Castleberry, 70-20.
Where the exception is that the refereedid not admit certain evidence,
and the case does not show that such evidence was competent or mate
rial, the exception will be overruled. Shehan v. Malone, 71-440; Ves
tal v. Sloan, 83-555.
A party excepting to the report of a referee to whom it was referred
to take an account, must designate particularly the charge or credit
excepted to, and refer the court distinctly and clearly to the ground of
i his exception. Exceptions, unaccompanied by such statement of facts,
will be overruled; as this court will not, nor will any court of appeals,
examine every item in the account, and the evidences bearing on it,
upon a general allegation of error. Whitford v. Foy, 71-527; Brumble
v. Brown, 71-513; Green v. Castleberry, 77-164; Currie v. McNeill, 83-176.
An exception to the report of a referee should discriminate and point
out specifically the faults complained of. An exception "that the referee
ought to have found as a conclusion of law that the plaintiff recover
nothing," is not sufficient. Suit v. Suit, 78-272; Cooper v. Middleton,
94-86.
An exception that a referee "does not report many specific objections
to particular items in an account" taken in the inquiry before him, is
too indefinite to be passed upon on appeal. Morrison a. Baker, 81-76.
Evidence cannot be heard to support au exception not made before the
referee. Overby v. Fayetteville, 81-56; Nash v. Taylor, 3-174.
It is not error to overrule exceptions to the report of a referee, which
are immaterial or not sustained by the facts. Murphy v. Harper, 84-189.
It is error for the judge to pass upon exceptions to au unfinished
report. White v. Utley, 86-415.
A referee's report as to the value of board and lodging, when there
is no agreement as to price, will not be disturbed. Wellborn v. Simonton, 88-266.
Where, in a series of findings by a referee, some are proper, an excep
tion to the whole will not be allowed. Worthy v. Brower, 93-344.
An exception to the report of a referee will not be considered when it
is vague and indefinite and imposes on the court the necessity of an
examination of the entire record to find out its meaning. Battle v.
Mayo, 102-413; Young v. Kennedy, 95-265.
Where a party excepts to the report of the referee because he fails to
find on a particular matter as a fact, and the report is recommitted to
the referee to pass on such matter, he cannot be allowed to except to the
second report on the ground that such matter is a mixed question of fact
and law. Tyson v. Tyson, 92-288..
Where the facts stated as a basis of exceptions conflict with the find
ings of the referee, the exceptions should be overruled, especially where
they are indefinite. Smith v. Smith, 101-461.
Where an order is made recommitting a report to a referee, with direc
tions to reform it in the particulars set out in the order, to which no
exception is made, the complainiug party cannot except to the report as
reformed in the manner directed, and thus review the order of re-refer
ence, but he must except to the order itself at the time it is made.
Cowles v. Curry, 96-331.
An exception to the admission of evidence by a referee, after objec
tion, which is not specific, but is vague and indefinite in form, will not
be considered. Perkins v. Berry, 103-131.
When, at the fiual report of a referee, a party moved to exclude certain
charges or items, this will be treated as an exception thereto, and there
can be no question as to the motion being in apt time, when no objection
by the other side was made. Rogers v. Bank, 108-574.
Trial before referee. —Where, in the trial of an action before a referee,
the defendant puts his evidence on one point, which is sustained by the
referee, he cannot ask to have other defences tried, not raised before the
referee, when the conclusions of the referee have been reversed. Wiley
v. Logan, 96-510.
Trials before referees should be governed by the rules formulated in
Green v. Castleberry. Battle v. Mayo, 102-413.
Upon a trial before a referee, one of the parties objected to certain
testimony as it was given in, but the referee did not then make a note
of such objections, but, at the end of the written evidence as taken
down by him, he noted that the evidence in question had been objected
to " in apt time ": Held, that this was a sufficient noting of the objec
tion, and from it the court would assume that the objections were made
as the evidence was offered. Armfield v. Colvert, 103-147.
Where the court would be justified in not submitting to the jury the
facts offered upon a given issue, a referee is justified in refusing to con
sider such facts in his findings. Stephenson v. Felton, 106-114.
Nonsuit before referee. —A plaintiff may take a nonsuit while the case is
pending before a referee, if the case be one in which he is entitled to do so. 
Orders of court pending reference. —Sending a case to be tried by a referee
does not deprive the court of its jurisdiction, and it can make any and
all necessary orders therein, pending the trial before the referee. McNeill
v. Lawton, 97-16.
Premature appeal.—An appeal from an order sustaining some of the
exceptions to a referee's report and overruling others, and recommitting
the report with instructions to correct the same in conformity to the
ruling of the court, is premature and will be dismissed. Upon the com
ing in of the report and the rendition of a final judgment, all the excep
tions can be noted and passed upon in one appeal. Jones v. Call, 89-188;
Torrence v. Davidson, 90-2; Lutz v. Cline, 89-186; Grant v. Reese, 90-3;
Leak v. Covington, 95-193; Wallace v. Douglas, 105-42.
Upon the coming in of a referee's report, defendant filed exceptions,
which were overruled and the case recommitted to the referee. Defend
ant excepted and appealed, but failed to perfect his appeal. When the
second report of the referee was filed, final judgment was rendered
against defendant, who appealed again: Held, that the supreme court
would review the rulings embraced in the f1rst appeal, more especially
as the former would have been held premature if perfected. Scroggs v.
Stevenson, 100-354.
Where, pending a reference, the defendant moved before the referee
to make new parties, which motion the referee certified to tb. * superior
court for its action, where the motion was allowed and the plaintiff
appealed, the appeal was dismissed as fragmentary. White v. Utley,
94-511See \ 548, post, and cases cited.
In the supreme court. —The supreme court reviews decisions of fact by
a judge or referee, as a court of appeals, and not as a court of original
jurisdiction. Green v. Castleberry, 77-164.
In a reference under The Code, the referee reports the evidence and
his findings of fact therefrom and his conclusions of law. Upon excep
tions filed, the judge reviews the findings of fact and law—the findings
of fact by the judge being conclusive, and his conclusions of law
reviewable on appeal; but if the judge does not find the facts, it is pre
sumed he accepts those found by the referee. Barcroft v. Roberts,
91-363; Hunter v. Kelley, 92-285.
And this is so even in actions which would formerly have been cogni
zable only in courts of equity. Battle v. Mayo, 102-413.
Where there is any evidence to support the finding of fact by a referee,
the jurisdiction of the supreme court is limited to correcting any errors
of law, and the findings of fact are conclusive if approved by the court
below. Rhyne v. Love, 98-486; Wiley v. Logan, 95-358; Reaves v.
Davis, 99-425; Abernathy v. Withers, 99-520; Kitchin v. Grandy, 101-86;
Howerton v. Sexton, 104-75; Nissen v. Manufacturing Co., 104-309;
Morrisey v. Swinson, 104-555; Wadesboro v. Atkinson, 107-317.
The findings of fact by a referee, under a reference by consent, except
those which relate to the admission of incompetent or the rejection of
competent testimony, or where there is no evidence to support them,
are not reviewable if approved by the judge. Grant v. Reese, 94-720;
Smith v. Smith, 101-461; Roper v. Burton, 107-526; Whitehead v. Whitehurst, 108-458; Joyner v. Stancill, 108-153; Turner v. Shuffler, 108-642;
Vaughan v. Lewellyn, 94-472.
Where an appeal is taken to the supreme court from the action of a
judge in passing upon exceptions to the report of a referee, exceptions
should be taken and stated in the record to the rulings of the judge
which it is sought to have reviewed, and the case ought not to be sent up to be heard only on the exceptions taken to the ruling of the referee.
Bank v. Manufacturing Co., 96-298.
The supreme court cannot consider exceptions to the findings of a
referee which depend upon the evidence, when no evidence is sent up
with the transcript. Jones v. Call, 96-337.
The supreme court will only consider the exceptions to the rulings
of the court below in confirming or disaffirming tne report of a referee.
Perry v. Hardison, 99-21.
An exception to a referee's report, not considered by the judge below,
caunot be considered on appeal; a ruling in the court below being neces
sary, to confer jurisdiction on appeal. In such case, the cause will be
left open in the lower court, that the exception may be passed upon
there. Scroggs v. Stevenson, 100-354.
The supreme court will not entertain an objection, made for the first
time before it, that the findings of fact by a referee were not supported
by any evidence. Joyner v. Stancill, 108-153.
After judgment in the supreme court. —When the exceptions to the report
of a referee are overruled, and, upon appeal, judgment is affirmed, such
exceptions cannot be reviewed, and the questions raised by them and
passed upon by the supreme court cannot be unsettled. Burwell v. Burgwyn, 105-507.
After final judgment in the supreme court, the superior court has no
power to order a further reference, or to take any action in the cause.
Pearson v. Carr, 97-194.
Arbitration and award. —Arbitrators are not bound to decide according
to law, and their findings of fact are conclusive. Gudger v. Baird, 66438; Lusk v. Clayton, 70-184; Keener v. Goodson, 89-273; Robbins v.
Killebrew, 95-19.
Where an arbitrator intends to l>e governed by rules of law, but mis
conceives them, he may be reviewed. Miller v. Bryan, 86-167; King vNeuse Mfg. Co., 79-360.
An award in writing, like a written contract, cannot be added to or
varied. It speaks for itself, and is not open to proof of the " under
standing " of the arbitrators as to its effect. Scott v. Green, 89-278.
In an action for the recovery of land, the defendant denied the alle
gations of the complaint and pleaded a counterclaim, alleging title to
the lands in himself, and asking damages for trespasses done thereon by
the plaintiffs. By consent, the case was submitted to arbitrators to
decide the matters in issue, except the question of title, the award to be a
judgment of the court. The arbitrators awarded damages to the defend
ant. Upon filing the award, the court gave judgment against the plain
tiffs for the amount found by the arbitrators: Held, to be erroneous, as
the defendant could have no judgment for damages until the issue as to
the title should be determined in his favor. Whedbee v. Leggett, 92-465.
Where a reference is made to several persons, the agreement of all is
necessary to an award, unless it is expressly agreed that a less number
may make it. Arbitrators have an implied authority to determine the
question of the costs of cause submitted to them. Oakley v. Anderson,
93-108.
Where an agreement to submit the matters in controversy to arbitra
tion has been made a rule of court, the award may be set aside for fraud,
insufficiency in not disposing of all matters referred, and for other ade
quate causes. Metcalf v. Guthrie, 94-447.
'
An agreement to submit a controversy to arbitration will be presumed
to embrace every issue of law and fact necessary to its final determina
tion. Robbins v. Killebrew, 95-19.
Where an agreement to submit a matter in controversy in a pending
action to arbitration, is not made a rule of court, but in accordance
with an independent agreement, made outside of the action, the failure
of either party to abide by the award, furnishes a new cause of action
for the recovery of damages at law, or for specific performance, in a
proper case, in a court of equity. The remedy must be sought in a new
action and cannot be obtained by setting it up in a supplemental com
plaint in the action pending. Metcalf v. Guthrie, 94-447; Jackson v.
McLean, 96-474; Long v. Fitzgerald, 97-39.
Where a party files exceptions to an award and seeks to have it modi
fied by the court, he waives all objection to the fact that the submission
was made in pais, and the court can proceed to act on the award as if
it had been made under an order in the cause. Long v. Fitzgerald, 97-39.
Where all matters embraced in an action are submitted to arbitrators,
and they make no mention in their award of one item of charge claimed
by one of the parties, they will be taken to have disallowed it. Ibid.
An award duly made upon an arbitration, and performed, constitutes
a good plea in bar to a subsequent action for the same cause. Cheatham
v. Rowland, 105-218.
The award of the arbitrator, when made a judgment of the court, is
final and conclusive between the parties. Reizenstein v. Hahn, 107-156.
See \ 420, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 423. Referees, how chosen; who may be referee;
report. C. C. P., 8. 247.
In all cases of reference the parties as to whom issues
are joined in the action (except when the defendant is an
infant or an absentee) may agree in writing upon a person
or persons, not exceeding three, and a reference shall be
ordered to him or them, and to no other person or persons.
And if such parties do not agree, the court shall appoint
one or more referees, not more than three, who shall be free
from exception. And no person shall be appointed referee
to whom all parties in the action shall object. And no
judge or justice of any court shall sit as referee in any action
pending in the court of which he is judge or justice, and
not already referred, unless the parties otherwise stipulate.
The referee shall make and deliver a report within such
time as may be ordered by the court. The report of the
referee shall be made to the clerk of the court in which the
action is pending; either party, during the term or upon
ten days' notice to the adverse party out of term, may
move the judge to review such report, and set aside, modify
or confirm the same in whole or in part, and no judgment shall be entered on any reference except by order of the
judge.
Right to terminate the reference. —A reference ordered by the court to
take an account, in an action pending before it, is not such a reference
as the parties or either of them may end at their election. Green v.
Green, 69-294.
A party cannot elect to end a reference after the report of the referee
has been made, and he has filed exceptions thereto. Armfield v. Brown,
70-27.
After the parties have once waived their right to a jury trial by con
senting to a reference, they cannot afterwards withdraw such waiver and
demand a jury, nor has the court power to discontinue it, at its discre
tion. Armfield v. Brown, 70-27; Perry v. Tupper, 77-413.
Where parties to an action agree to refer the matter in controversy to
a referee, their assent continues until the order of reference is complied
with by a full report. In such case an objection of one of the parties to
a re-reference to the same referee was properly overruled. Fleming v.
Roberts, 77-415.
Note.—This section as now amended neither requires the report, as
formerly, to lie filed in sixty days, nor permits Hie parties to terminate
the reference on notice.
Reference set aside. —The court can, in its discretion, set aside a refer
ence to state an account, after report made and exceptions filed, and
proceed to try the case. Bushee v. Surles, 79-51.
Appointment of an attorney in the action as arbitrator. —Qutrre, whether
the reference of an action by consent to an attorney in the cause, for
arbitration revokes his authoritv as attorney. Williams v. Thomas,
78-47.
Report set aside. —It is the duty of a referee to state positively and, defi
nitely all the facts constituting the grounds of defence, and not leave
to inference what is the precise fact intended to be found. Conclusions
of law and fact must be stated separately; otherwise the appellate court
cannot review the referee's conclusious of law, its peculiar province,
and the report of the referee will be set aside as being defective, and
the cause remanded. Earp v. Richardson, 75-84.
A report of a referee that does not state all the items of the account
between the parties, will be set aside for vagueness. McCampbell v.
McClung, 75-393A report of a referee will not be set aside and re-reference ordered,
where the same, though informal, furnishes the information required.
Gulley v. Macy, 89-343; Grant v. Edwards, 92-442.
Where the report of a referee is imperfect or unsatisfactory, the court
will disregard the exceptions thereto and order a reference with instruc
tions as to the manner of stating the account. Grant v. Bell, 90-559.
A referee admitted certain evidence, which was objected to, and made
his report without ruling on the admissibility of such evidence. In the
superior court there was an order of re-reference, in which the referee
was expressly directed to rule upon the admissibility of the evidence
objected to. The referee made another report, without passing on the
evidence, and the defendant excepted: Held, that it was error to give
judgment confirming the report without passing on the objection to the
evidence, and that the judge below could pass upon the competency of
the evidence, without again recommitting the case to the referee. Wal
lace v. Douglass, 103-19.
Evidence should accompany report. —The evidence in writing upon which
facts are found by a referee must accompany his report. Cain v. Nichson, 77-411; Com'rs v. Magnin, 85-114.
A referee is not required to refer to the evidence in his findings of fact.
All that is required is that he should transmit to the court the evidence
upon which his findings are based. Barbee v. Green, 92-471.
All the evidence taken by a referee should accompany his report, to
the end that it may be considered by the court in reviewing his findings.
Tharington v. Tharington, 99-118.
That the referee has not reported all the evidence taken during the
trial before him, is not ground of exception. If all the evidence is not
sent up, the remedy of the prejudiced party is by application to the
judge for an order directing the referee to send up that which has been
omitted. Perkins v. Bern,-, 103-131; Williams v. Whiting, 92-683.
A report of a referee having been filed, and the parties allowed time
for exceptions, a party who has not filed exceptions within the time has
no right to take the objection, by motion for a recommittal, that the
evidence was not filed with the report, and the referee did not report the
facts upon which he based his conclusions of law; though the court
might, in its discretion, allow him to except for sufficient cause shown.
Manufacturing Co. v. Williamson, 100-83.
Exceptions, when to be filed. —Exceptions must be filed at the term at
which the report is submitted. It is in the discretion of the judge
whether they are permitted to be filed at a subsequent term or not.
Long v. Logan, 86-535; Com'rs v. Magnin, 85-114; McNeill v. Hodges,
105-52.
Exceptions to a referee's report should be filed at the term to which
the report is made. University v. Lassiter, 83-38. But if this is not
done, the court can, in its discretion, allow exceptions to lie filed at any
time before judgment upon the report. State v. Peebles, 67-97.
Exceptions to be heard within the county. —Except by consent, or in those
cases*specially permitted by the statutes, the judge of the superior court
has no jurisdiction to hear a cause or make orders therein outside of
the county in which the action is pending. McNeill v. Hodges, 99-248.
See, generally, cases cited under preceding sections of this sub-chapter.

ment against married woman. C. C. P., s.248.
(1) Judgment may be given for or against one or more
of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of sev
eral defendants; and it may determine the ultimate rights
of the parties on each side as between themselves;
Judgments, how framed. —Under The Code, the courts are required to
frame their judgments so as to protect both the legal and equitable
rights of the parties. Hutchinson v. Smith, 6S-354.
A judgment may determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each
side between themselves as well as between the adverse parties in the liti
gation. Hare v. Jernigan, 76-471; Clark v. Williams, 70-679; Hughes v.
Boone, 81-204.
When an action is brought for an injur)- caused by the separate acts
of parties having a common interest adverse to the plaintiff, the jury
may assess separate damages as to each. Long v. Swindell, 77-176.
A judgment rendered in favor of a plaintiff, and an affirmative one in
favor of the defendant, though written and attested separately, constitute
but one judgment. Hall v. Younts, 87-285.
In ejectment, the plaintiff may recover and defendant will retain so
much of the land as each shows himself entitled to upon the evidence,
unaffected by the fact that both, in the pleadings, set up a claim to the
whole tract. Cowles v. Ferguson, 90-308.
Where the plaintiff is not made a party in her representative capacity
as administratrix, no judgment can be given affecting her as such. Usry
v. Suit, 91-406.
In an action to recover for work and labor upon the construction of a
house, the court may, in a judgment for the amount due, decree a lieu
on the premises therefor. Oakley v. Van Noppen, 95-60.
It is not erroneous, in an action against the sureties upon several
bonds of a public officer, to enter judgment against the defendants for
the penalties of their respective bonds. Davenport v. McKee, 98-500.
A judgment can be rendered in favor of one co-defendant against
another. McNeill v. Hodges, 105-52; Hare v. Jernigan, 76-471;

relief to which he may be entitled ;
Judgment for counterclaim. —Whenever the answer sets up a counter
claim, the defendant, if he recover, is entitled to any judgment required
to make it effectual. Walsh v. Hall, 66-233.
When a party is sued by a firm, he may have judgment in the action
on a counterclaim against the partnership, or against either of the part
ners. Sloan v. McDowell, 71-356.
A vendee, in an executory contract to convey lands, having failed to
pay the purchase-money when it became due, subsequently purchased
his notes therefor at an administrator's sale for a nominal amount, and
then brought an action to compel the vendor's representatives to convey
to him: Held, (1) that a specific performance would not be decreed until
the vendee had paid the price stipulated in the contract of sale; (2) that
the defendants having prayed for affirmative relief, it was not error to
decree that the lands should be sold and the proceeds applied to the sat
isfaction of the balance due, if the plaintiff did not pay within a time
fixed. Burnap v. Sidberry, 108-307.
See \ 244, ante, and cases cited.
Judgment for defendant on both legal and equitable defences. —A defendant
is entitled to set up as many defences as he may have, legal or equitable,
and to have such relief, affirmative or other, as shall be legally author
ized on the facts constituting his defence. Melvin v. Stephens, 82-283.
Both legal and equitable rights are now administered in one and the
same action. Hence, if to a suit for specific performance of a contract
to convey land the statute of frauds is pleaded, the court can render
judgment for return of the purchase-money. Pendleton v. Dalton,
92-185.
Judgment for one defendant against the other. —Under The Code practice
co-defendants cannot set up demands and take relief against each other,
unless their disputes arise out of the subject of the action as set out in
the complaint, and have such relations to the plaintiff's claim that their
adjustment is necessary to a final determination of the cause. Hulbert
v. Douglas, 94-128.
Mesue profits. —Where, after final judgment in the supreme court, it was
suggested that since the date to which the referee's report settled the
rights and liabilities of the parties, the plaintiff had remained in posses
sion of the land and become liable for additional rents, the right could
not be enforced in this action, but the defendant must bring a new action
to ascertain the amount of such additional liability. Pearson v. Carr,
97-194.
Under the present method of civil procedure, rents are recoverable up
to the time of triat. Morisey v. Swinson, 104-555.
(3) 1n an action against several defendants, the court
may, in its discretion, render judgment against one or more
of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others,
whenever a several judgment may be proper ;
Judgment against one or more defendants. —When landlord and tenant
are sued together in an action to recover laud, and the tenant fails to

clark's code of civil procedure.

answer or to verify his answer, the complaint being verified, there may
be a judgment entered against him, but no execution can issue until
the trial of the issue made up by the landlord. Harkey v. Houston,
65-'37- .
....
. .
The rights and liabilities of the defendants, not only to the plaintiff,
but to each other, may be determined in the action, and should be
embraced in the judgment. Clark v. Williams, 70-679; Hare v. Jernigan, 76-471.
It is against the practice to sever the facts of a demand in the com
plaint and enter judgment for one portion, and order a reference to
ascertain the amount of the other portion for judgment as to that.
Depriest v. Patterson, 85-376.
Judgment as to part and continuance as to the rest. —Judgment can be taken
for so much of the plaintiff's demand as is admitted by the answer and
the case continued as to the rest. Parker v. Bledsoe, 87-221.
(4) The court may also dismiss the complaint, with costs
in favor of one or more defendants, in case of unreasona
ble neglect on the part of the plaintiff to serve the sum
mons on other defendants, or to proceed in the cause against
the defendant or defendants served. In an action brought
by or against a married woman, judgment may be given
against her as well for costs as for damages, or both, for
such costs and for such damages, in the. same manner as
against other persons, to be levied and collected of her
separate estate, and not otherwise.
Judgment on an award of arbitrators. —It was not the intention of The
Code to deprive parties of the right to refer all matters in controversy
to arbitrators, with power to make an award, which should be a rule of
court. This is merely an agreementto confess judgment according to the
award. If the parties have no suit in court concerning the matters
referred, the court will not enforce it as a rule of court, but will leave
the parties to their remedy on the arbitration bond. Lusk v. Clayton,
70-184.
Where a cause is referred to arbitrators, the submission to be a rule of
court, the court enters judgment according to the award. Keener v.
Goodson, 89-273.
See cases on " Arbitration " cited under \\ 420 and 422, ante.
Validity of judgments. —A judgment is not void because no complaint
has been filed. Little v. McCarter, 89-233.
An omission to sign a judgment will not avoid it as to strangers.
Rollins v. Henry, 78-342.
The validity of a judgment is not affected by the failure of a judge
to sign it, since the statute providing for such signing is merely directory.
Keener v. Goodson, 89-273; Matthews v. Joyce, 85-258.
Note. —The act requiring the signature of the judge to judgments
seems repealed, except in cases where infants are parties to the action,
and in special proceedings.
See \ 288, ante, and cases cited.
Judgment good in part and erroneous in part. —A judgment consisting of
several distinct and independent parts may be good as to one part and
erroneous as to the others. Moore v. Ingram, 91-376.
Judgments set aside.—A judgment can only be reviewed upon some
direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. Weeks v. Weeks, 79-77.
A court may always vacate or modify its judgment during the term at
which it is rendered. Halyburton v. Carson, 80-16; State v. Warren,
92-825; In r^Brittain, 93-587.
Where a final decree has been entered in a proceeding and carried
into effect, the only mode of testing its validity is by a new action com
menced by summons. England v. Garner, 84-212; Covington v. Ingrain,
64-123; Thaxton v. Williainston, 72-125; Peterson v. Vann, 83-118.
Judgments against a corporation rendered upon process issued after it
ceased to exist are of no validity, and may be impeached by any party
interested in the administration of its assets. Dobson v. Simonton,
86-492.
A judgment can be set aside for irregularity, only at the instance of
the party prejudiced. Hinsdale v. Haw-ley, 89-87; Jacobs v. Burgwyn,
63-196; Rollins v. Henry, 78-342.
Where a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is afterwards
set aside, the rights of third persons honestly acquired thereunder will
be respected; but otherwise, where such parties have knowledge of any
irregularity or fraud in procuring its rendition. Morris v. Gentry,
89-248.
The law presumes that a party to an action has notice thereof, and a
knowledge of its nature, but the contrary can be shown in a proceeding
to attack the judgment therein. Ibid.
A court has power to set aside and vacate a consent judgment for
fraud or surprise, but it cannot alter or correct it, except with the con
sent of all the parties affected by it. Vaughan v. Gooch, 92-524; Kerchner v. McEachern, 93-447.
The courts will be slow to exercise the power to vacate judicial pro
ceedings, where persons relying upon their integrity have acquired
rights thereunder, or where the parties asking such relief have allowed
a long time to elapse and no meritorious reason is shown. Edwards v.
Moore, 99-1.
A judgment may be set aside when the irregularity has not been
waived or cured and may yet work injury to the complaining party.
White v. Morris, 107-92.
Irregular judgment validated. —Although a judgment to sell land be
irregular, yet it may be rendered valid by the parties interested receiving
the fund raised by such judgment. Dawkins v. Dawkins, 93-283.
See H 273, 274 and 412, ante, and cases cited.
Judgments nunc pro tunc The court will, in general, permit a record

term of court without the consent of parties, except in cases where the
law clothes him with jurisdiction at chambers. Hardin v. Ray, 89-364.
While judgments should be signed and entered in term time, yet,
where parties consent that the same may be signed by the judge after
the term has expired and entered as of the term, it is not irregular.
Shackelford v. Miller, 91-181.
Where, in term time, one of the plaintiffs in the action moved to be
allowed to withdraw from the suit, and this motion was, by consent,
continued to be heard with others pending in the cause at a day out of
term when it was allowed: Held not to be error. Gatewood v. Leak,
99-363See \ 384, ante, and J 567, post.
Date of judgment presumably date of debt. —The date of a judgment will
be taken as the date of the debt upon which it was rendered, unless the
contrary appears of record. Mebane v. Layton, 89-396, approved; Buie
v. Scott, 107-181; Hill v. Oxeudine, 79-331.
Personal judgment against assignees and trustees. —Assignees and trustees,
acting in good faith under a conveyance afterwards declared fraudulent
and void by judicial decree, will be protected from liability. It is erro
neous to enter personal judgment against them upon a verdict establish
ing the fraudulent intent of their vendors. Rouse v. Bowers, 108-1S2.
Interest on judgments. — Every judgment or decree, except for costs,
shall bear interest till paid. Long v. Long, 85-415.
See 529, 530 and 531, post, and cases cited.
An order taxing coats is a judgment.— An order taxing costs against a
party in favor of the officers of the court, is, in effect, a judgment. Sheppard v. Bland, 87-163.

man v. Penland, 79-197; State v. Lanier, S9-517; Honeycut v. Angel,
20-306.
Judgments of a court in a case properly constituted before it, and
where it has jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter of controversy,
are" deemed to be valid, and will be upheld until impeached by a direct
proceeding for that purpose. They cannot be attacked collaterally.
Morris v. Gentry, 89-248; State v. Smith, 100-550; Mclver v. Stephens,
101-255; Brooks v. Brooks, 97-136.
Distinction between erroneous and irregular judgments. —The distinction
between an erroneous and an irregular judgment traced by Reade, J.
Wolf v. Davis, 74-597.
Irregular judgments. —A judgment which allows a surety on the bond of
a purchaser of land at a judicial sale, who has paid the purchase-money,
to be subrogated to the rights of the purchaser and have title made to
himself, is irregular, unless it appears that there was notice given to the
parties to be affected by it. Dawkins v. Dawkins, 93-283.
A decree directing a commissioner to sell land, receive the purchasemoney and make title, without requiring a report and confirmation of
the sale by the court, is irregular. Dula v. Seagle, 98-458.
See \\ 274 and 384, ante.
Judgments attacked collaterally. —Where non-resident infant tenants in
common filed an cx parte petition to sell land for partition, by their
guardian, who was a non-resident, the decree of sale is not void, and
cannot be attacked collaterally. Tate v. Mott, 96-19.
The recital in the record of a cause that the defendants therein had
been served with process, is evidence that the service was made and the
court acquired jurisdiction of the persons. Such record cannot be
attacked collaterally; if assailed for irregularity, it should be by a motion
in the cause; if for fraud, and the action be ended, by independent suit.
Brickhouse v. Sutton, 99-103; Carter v. Rountree, 109, and cases cited.
Where the record shows that a person was a party, and the court had
jurisdiction of the subject of the action, a judgment therein cannot be
collaterally attacked, on the ground that the person was not in fact a
party. The proper remedy is by a direct proceeding to correct the record
and vacate the judgment. The fact that the party complaining was, at
the rendition of the judgment, a lunatic or infant, constitutes no excep
tion to this rule. Brittain v. Mull, 99-483.
While any person having an irterest in the subject may attack collat
erally a judgment which is void, or may move to strike it from the record
as a nullity, yet the general rule is that only parties to the action will be
heard to assail a judgment or record for irregularity. Walton v. McKes
son, 101-42S.
A judgment of the superior court, directing a sale of lands upon the
ex parte petition of those interested, cannot be attacked collaterally for
irregularity where the record is apparently regular on its face. Tyson v.
Helcher, 102-112.
Judgment against iufmts. —A judgment rendered against infant defend
ants, who have never been served with process, and who have no general
or testamentary guardian, nor guardian ad litem, is void. The receipt
of money under such judgment by the infants, docs not give vitality to
the judgment. They may be made to account for the amounts received
in another action. Stancill v. Gay, 92-462.
A judgment rendered before the adoption of the Code of Civil Proce
dure against infants who were not served with process, but who were rep
resented by a guardian ad litem, is valid and binding on the infant, unless
it appears that no real defence was made for the infant, and that he has
suffered thereby. Hare v. Hollomon, 94-14.
An irregular or erroneus judgment against an infant stands in full
force until reversed. White v. Morris, 107-92; Turner v. Douglas,
72-127.
See U 181, 274, 384 and 3S7, ante.
Against a dead man. —Judgment can be entered where defendant dies
after verdict, without making his personal representatives or heirs par
ties. Beard v. Hall, 79-506.
But judgment entered by default final against a dead man, will be
vacated on motion, Burke v. Stokcly, 65-569.
A judgment rendered against a person then dead—that fact being
unknown to the court or the other parties— is not void, but is irregular
and voidable; and on the application of the proper representatives of
the deceased, or by any persoti having acquired interest in the subjectmatter of the suit, after it was begun, under him, made in apt time, it
will be vacated. The remedy in such case must be sought by a motion
in the cause, and not by a separate action. Knott v. Taylor, 99-51 1.
When the record contains no notice or suggestion of the death of a
party, a judgment rendered against such deceased, after his death, is
not void, but only voidable. Grubb v. Lookabill, 100-267.
A judgment against a party to a suit rendered after his death is void
able, even if the fact of death was unknown. Wood v. Watson, 107-52.
In favor of a dead man, —A judgment in favor of a dead man is not
void, and not, on that account, irregular. Wood v. Watson, 107-52.
Against personal representative. —When, in an action for an account and
settlement, the death of the defendant being suggested, the executor is
substituted as a party, a motion to file an answer denying assets should
be denied. The judgment now only ascertains the indebtedness. Grant
v. Bell, 91-495Alternative and conditional judgments. —Alternative or conditional judg
ments are void. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273; Strickland v. Cox, 102-411;
State v. Perkins, 82-681; State v. Bennett, 20-42; In re Deaton, 105-59.
Judgment upon verdict rendered to the clerk.—Where counsel on both
sides agree that the clerk may take the verdict of the jury, and after
wards such agreement is rescinded with notice to the clerk, but not to
the presiding judge, a judgment of the court, rendered in ignorance of
such rescission, is not irregular. Fickey v. Merrimon, 79-585.
Where, in an action brought to recover land, after the verdict was
rendered the court refused to sign judgment and ordered the action to
be continued in order that the plaintiff might move to have a judgment
affecting the land rendered by another court set aside: // was held to be
error. In such case, the court has the power, on application of the
plaintiff, to continue the case for this purpose, but it cannot do so against
the wishes of both parties, of its own motion. Burgess v. Kirby, 94-575.
The court ought not to render judgment upon an aspect of the case
not presented by the pleadings or verdict upon the issues submitted to
the jury. Oakley v. Van Noppen, 95-60.
See $412 (1) and 412 (4) and cases cited.
Judgment on certificate from supreme court. —Where the judgment of the
superior court, in a case remanded to it from the supreme court, carries
out the decision rendered on the first appeal, it will be affirmed. Ogburn
v. Wilson, 96-211.
See Rules of Superior Court, Rule 19, post.
Judgment an estoppel. —Married women and infants are estopped by
judgments, in actions to which they are proper parties, in the same
manner as persons sui juris. Grantham v. Kennedy, 91-148.
The rule which declares a judgment conclusive of everything that
might have been litigated in the action applies only to the particular
issue or matter acludlty determined therein, and is only an estoppel to
that extent. Williams v. Clouse, 91-322.
A judgment entered confirming a report of a referee settles all mat
ters taken into the account, and is a bar to any claim which should
have been set up in that reference, but not as to subsequent collections
not passed upon in such reference and judgment. Williams v. Batchelor, 90-364.
When, in an action brought against the executor and heirs at law and
devisees of the testator, the court, having jurisdiction both of the per
sons and of the subject-matter of the action, ordered the land in contro
versy to be sold, and it was sold and purchased and paid for by the
defendant herein, and the sale was confirmed and title ordered by the
court to be made to the purchaser, which was done, the defendants in
such action are estopped by the judgment and cannot impeach it collat
erally in another action by showing that the land belonged to them and
was embraced in the orders of the court by mistake, inadvertence or
misapprehension. Jones v. Coffey, 97-347.
Judgments are conclusive against all parties thereto until they are duly
reversed or set aside for fraud or irregularity. Spivey v. Harrell, 101-48.
Every defence which was available at the time of the rendition of a
judgment, in the absence of fraud, is conclusively presumed to be deter
mined thereby, and the parties are estopped thereby so long as the judg
ment remains in existence. Davie v. Davis, 108-501; Rogers v. Kinsey,
iQ1-559.
Where the title to land is put in issue by the pleadings and issues, the
verdict and judgment operate as an estoppel on the parties as to the
title. Allen v. Sallinger, 103-14; Johnson v. Pate, 90-334; Cowles v.
Ferguson, 90-305.
See \\ 384, 387 and 412 (1), ante.
Parties and privies. —None but parties and privies are bound by a judg
ment. Simpson v. Cureton, 97-112.
Sec. 425. The relief to be awarded to the plaintiff. C. C. P.,
8. 249.
The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer,
cannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his
complaint ; but in any other case the court may grant him
any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint
and embraced within the issue.
If no complaint is filed.—A judgment is not void because no complaint
has been filed. Little v. McCarter, 89-233; Vick v. Pope, 81-22; Leach
v. Railroad, 65-485; Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
See \\ 232 and 384, ante.
If an answer is filed. —The judgment, where there is an answer, may
be for any relief embraced in the issues. Jones v. Mial, 79-164, and
cases cited, \ 233 (3), ante.
Judgment non obstante veredicto. —A judgment non obstante veredicto is
granted in cases where the plea confesses a cause of action and the
matter relied on in defence is insufficient. Ward v. Phillips, 89-215;
Move v. Petway, 76-327; Walker v. Scott, 106-56.

v. Jones, 97-121.
See l\ 177 and 384, ante, and cases cited.
Objection after judgment too late. —After judgment is rendered on a
claim it is too late, for a creditor in a creditor's bill, to object that the
cause of action was barred by the statute when judgment was rendered.
Moore v. Edwards, 92-43.
If case proven differs wholly from the complaint. —Where the proof estab
lishes a case wholly different from the one alleged, and inconsistent
therewith, no relief can be granted nor amendment permitted, and the
action must fail. Carpenter v. Huffsteller, 87-273.
Relief to be awarded the plaintiff. —A tenant in common in personalty
cannot recover specific goods from a co-tenant; his remedy is by parti
tion. Powell v. Hill, 64-169.
Where a guardian lent the funds of his wards to a firm of which he
was a member, he may sue upon the partnership note and follow the
fund into whose hands soever it may have passed. Gudger v. Baird,
66-438.
The distinction between the forms of actions having been abolished,
it would defeat the purpose of that provision if the defendant were
allowed to avail himself of an objection founded on such distinction.
Therefore, when a complaint sets out a cause of action in assumpsit,
and the proof shows one in trover, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.
Oates v. Kendall, 67-241.
A plaintiff who sues for claim and delivery of personal property can
not, under the prayer for other relief, without amending his complaint,
recover damages, when the facts show that the defendant did not have
the property in possession when suit was brought. Haughton v. New
berry, 69-456.
Where the plaintiff sets out the facts of, and asks relief upon, a special
contract, yet he can, without amending his complaint, recover his dam
ages as on the common counts in general assumpsit. Jones v. Mial,
82-252.
Under The Code practice, a party is not restricted to the specific relief
demanded by him, but may have any additional and different relief
which the pleadings and facts proven show to be just and proper.
Knight v. Houghtaling, 85-17.
Where the plaintiff alleged a contract to pay for services performed,
and, upon the trial, failed to prove a special contract, but did prove the
performance of the services and their value, he was entitled to recover

Sec. 420. Judgment in certain cases to be a conveyance of
title. R. C, c. 32, s. 24. 1850, c. 107, 8. 1. lS74-\!>, c.
17, 8. 1.
In any action, wherein the court shall declare that, a party
is entitled to the possession of property, real or personal,
the legal title whereof may be in another or others, parties
to the suit, and the court shall order a conveyance of such
legal title to him so declared to be entitled, or where, for
any cause, the court shall order that one of the parties hold
ing property in trust shall convey the legal title therein to
be held in trust to another person, although not a party,
the court, after declaring the right and ordering the con
veyance, shall have power, also, to be used in its discretion,
to declare in the order then made, or in any made in the
progress of the cause, that the effect thereof shall be to
transfer to the party to whom the conveyance is directed to
be made, the legal title of the said property, to be held in
the same plight, condition and estate as though the convey
ance ordered was in fact executed ; and shall bind and
entitle the parties ordered to execute or to take benefit of
the conveyance, in and to all such provisions, conditions
and covenants as may be adjudged to attend the conveyance,
in the same manner and to the same extent as the convey
ance would if the same were executed according to the
order. And any party taking benefit under the judgment
may have the same redress at law on account of the matter
adjudged as he might on the conveyance, if the same had
been executed.
Decree by consent. —A decree by consent is merely a conveyance between
the parties, binding tlieui and their privies in estate, but it is open to the
latter to impeach it for fraud. Rollins v. Henry, 7S-342.
Decree confirming sale. —A final decree confirming a sale and declaring
that the effect of the decree shall be to convey the title as fully as if a
deed had been executed, is in accordance with this section, and cannot
be impeached, except by a civil action commenced by summons. Thaxton v. Williamson, 72-125.
Decree directing conveyance npon payment of a certain sum. —Where a
decree directs a reconveyance of land upon payment of a certain debt,
to secure which the land has been conveyed, the land remains subject to
to the control of the court, and the title does not pass till the payment,
notwithstanding the administrator of the creditor enters satisfaction of
the debt upon the docket upon receipt of the debtor's note for the
amount. Davis v. Rogers, 84-412.
Sec. 427. Judgment to be regarded an a deed, and to be
registered, li. C, c. 32, 8. 25. 1830, e. 17, ». 3. I874--5,
c. 17, 8. 2.
Every judgment, in which the transfer of title shall be so
declared, shall be regarded as a deed of conveyance, exe
cuted in due form and by capable persons, notwithstanding
the want of capacity in any person ordered to convey, and
shall be registered in the proper county, under the same
rules and regulations as may be prescribed for conveyances
of similar property executed by the party ; and all laws
which may be passed for extending the time for registration
of deeds shall be deemed to include such judgments, pro
vided the conveyance, if actually executed, would be so
included.
Decree operating as conveyance. —A decree does not operate as a convey
ance, unless it complies with the requirements of this section by declar
ing "that it shall be regarded as a deed of conveyance, "etc. Morris
v. White, 96-91; Smith v. King, 107-273.
Decree of cancellation. —There is no provision of the statute that when a
deed is ordered to be cancelled an entry thereof should be made on
the margin of its registration, but it is a practice to be recommended.
Smith v. King, 107-273.
Note. —By ch. 147, acts 1885, deeds are valid as to third parties only
from registration, and since that -act the time for registering deeds has
not been extended, so that the last paragraph of this section is now
ineffective. .
Sec. 428. Copy of judgment from register's office to be evi
dence. R. C, c. 32, s. 20. 1850, c. 107, s. 3. 1874-'5, c.
17,8.3.
In all legal proceedings touching the right of parties
derived under such judgment, a certified copy thereof from
the register's books shall be evidence of its existence and
of the matters therein contained, as fully as if the same
were proved by a perfect transcript of the whole case.
Sec. 429. Judgment to be registered as deeds. R. C, c. 32,
s.27. 1850, c. 107, s. 4. 1874-'5, c. 17, s. 4.
The party desiring registration of such judgment shall
produce to the register a copy thereof, certified by the clerk
of the court in which it is enrolled, under the seal of the
court, and the register shall record both the judgment and
certificate.
Sec. 430. Rates of damages where damages are recover
able. C. C. P., s. 250.
Whenever damages are recoverable, the plaintiff may
claim and recover, if he show himself entitled thereto, any
rate of damages which he might have heretofore recovered
for the same cause of action.
See Battle's Digest, vol. 1, pp. 311-319; vol. 4, pp. 1 19-120; Rev. Code,
passim.
Note. —This section does not lay down any rule of damages beyond
affirming that they should be measured by the rules of law and statutes
already existing.
Sec. 431. Judgment in action for recovery of personal
property. C. C. P., s. 231.
In an action to recover the possession of personal prop
erty, judgment for the plaintiff may be for the possession,
or for the recovery of possession, or for the value thereof,
in case a delivery cannot be had, and the damages for the
detention. If the property has been delivered to the plain
tiff, and the defendant claims a return thereof, judgment
for the defendant may be for a return of the property, or
for the value thereof in case a return cannot be had, and
damages for taking and withholding the same.
Judgment for damages, when. — In actions to recover personal property,
when the plaintiff has not invoked the aid of the provisional remedy of
claim and delivery, his judgment, if he succeeds, is for the possession of
the property or for its value and damages for its detention, as in the old
action of detinue. Jarman v. Ward, 67-32.
A judgment in au action to recover specific personal property is no bar
to a subsequent action against the same parties for damages for the tak
ing and detention of such property. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189.
Where the plaintiff, who had recovered judgment in an action of claim
and delivery (in which he was defendant) for the return of the property,
but the same had not been returned, thereafter brings suit against the
plaintiff in such action for damages for the conversion of the property:
Held, that he was entitled to recover. Asher v. Reizenstein, 105-213.
Assignee of judgment.—A lessor recovered judgment against lessee in an
action of claim and delivery to recover possession of crops and enforce
his lien for rent. Pending the suit, the lessee delivered a portion of the
crop to the defendants to pay for supplies furnished him. The judg
ment was assigned to the plaintiff who sues defendant for damages for
the conversion: Held, the plaintiff assignee acquired no title to any
property not mentioned in the judgment, and he must accept the assessed
money value of such as cannot be delivered under the judgment. The
assignment is not of all the rights of the lessor, but of the right vested
in him by virtue of the judgment, and to enforce the same against the
lessee. Timberlake v. Powell, 99-233.
Form of judgment. —The judgment in claim and delivery should be in
the alternative for the delivery of the specific property, if to be had,
and if not, then its value, to be assessed by the jury. Council v. Averett,
90-168; Hall v. Tillman, 103-276.
Where claim and delivery is brought to recover possession of property
to sell it under a contract to pay an indebtedness, the plaintiff recover
ing judgment holds the .property as trustee to apply proceeds as directed
by the judgment, if possession of the property cannot be had the judg
ment should be in the alternative. Austin v. Secrest, 91-214.
In respect to that portion which plaintiff fails to recover, the judgment
should direct a return to the defendant, or that the value thereof, to be
ascertained by the jury, should be paid him if a return cannot be made.
Horton v. Home, 99-219.
Where, in an action of claim and delivery, the plaintiff, claiming a
mortgage lien, seized, and the defendant replevied, $223.50 worth of
property, and on the trial the plaintiff recovered judgment for $50.37,
the proper judgment to be entered is, "That plaintiff recover the specific
property, and if possession cannot be had, then the penal sum named
111 the bond of the defendant and his sureties, with a proviso that the
specific property shall be relieved of the lien and liability to seizure and
sale, and the defendant and the sureties on his bond discharged by the
payment of $50.37, with interest from the beginning of the term, and
costs." Taylor v. Hodges, 105-344.
Note. —See amendment to $ 326, ante.
Interest.—Interest is not allowed as a matter of law in an action of
claim and delivery, though the jury can, if they wish, allow interest on
the value of the property, from the time it was taken, as damages.
Patapsco v. Magee, 86-350.
See ?§32i, 322, 323, 326, 333, 385, 3S6, 387, 38S, 390 and 409, and cases
cited.
See. 4.'12. What judge to approve judgments, orders and
decrees. 187<>-'7, c. 233, s. 3. 1870, c. 63. 1881. c.Sl.
In all cases where a judgment, decree or order of the
superior court is required to be approved by a judge, it shall
be approved by the judge having jurisdiction of receivers
and injunctions.
In open court.—Except in cases of consent, and where otherwise pro
vided by statute, orders and judgments should be signed in open court.
Branch v. Walker, 92-87.
Sec. 433. Judgments to be docketed and indexed; judg
ments at the same term, when held to he docketed. C. C.
P., s. 252. Rule XVIII.
Every judgment of the superior court affecting the right
to real property, and any judgment requiring in whole or
in part the payment of money, shall be entered by the clerk
of said superior court on the judgment docket of said court.
The entry shall contain the names of the parties, and the
relief granted, date of judgment and date of docketing;
and the clerk shall keep a cross index of the whole, with
the dates and numbers thereof. All judgments rendered
in any county by the superior court thereof, during a
term of the court, and docketed during the same term, or
within ten days thereafter, shall be held and deemed to
have been rendered and docketed on the first day of said
term.
Lien of judgment.—A judgment is not a lien upon land, in the absence
of the actual levy of an execution, until it is docketed in the county
where the land is situate, in the manner prescribed by this section, and
upon the docket required to be kept by \ 83 of The Code. Holman v.
Miller, 103-118; Alsop v. Moseley, 104-60.
See '{ 435, post, and cases cited.
Sec. 434. Judgment-roll. C. C. P., ». 2~>3.
Unless the party or his attorney shall furnish a judgmentroll, the clerk, immediately after entering the judgment,
shall attach together, and file the following papers, which
shall constitute the judgment-roll :
(1) In case the complaint be not answered by any defend
ant, the summons and complaint, or copies thereof, proof
of service, and that no answer has been received, the report,
if any, and a copy of the judgment ;
(2) In all other cases, the summons, pleadings, or copies
thereof, and a copy of the judgment, with any verdict or
report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions, case, and all
orders and papers in any way involving the merits and
necessarily affecting the judgment.
Sec. 435. Judgments, when and how to be docketed ; secured
on appeal. C. C. P., s. 254. JSS7, c.
Upon filing a judgment-roll upon a judgment affecting
the title of real property, or directing in whole or in part
the payment of money, it shall be docketed on the judg
ment docket of the superior court of the county where the
judgment-roll was filed, and may be docketed on the judg
ment docket of the superior court of any other county upon
the filing with the clerk thereof a transcript of the original
docket, and shall be a lien on the real property in the
county where the same is docketed, of every person against
whom any such judgment shall be rendered, and which he
may have at the time of the docketing thereof in the county
in which such real property is situated, or which he shall
acquire at any time thereafter, for ten years from the date
of the rendition of the judgment. But the time during
which the party recovering or owning such judgment shall
be, or shall have been, restrained from proceeding thereon
by an order of injunction, or other order, or by the operation
of any appeal, or by a statutory prohibition, shall not con
stitute any part of the ten years aforesaid, as against the
defendant in such judgment, or the party obtaining such
orders or making such appeal, or any other person who is
not a purchaser, creditor or mortgagee in good faith. But
whenever an appeal from any judgment shall be pending,
and the undertaking requisite to stay execution on such
judgment shall have been given, and the appeal perfected
as provided in title thirteen of this chapter, the court in
which judgment was recovered may, on special motion, after
notice to the person owning the judgment, on such terms
as they shall see fit, direct an entry to be made by the clerk
on the docket of such judgment, that the same is secured
on appeal, and thereupon no execution shall issue upon
such judgment during the pendency of said appeal.
Note I. —The section as above given contains the amendment made
by ch. 192, acts 1887. This amendment, while permitting an order to
be granted staying execution, if proper security is given, would not, it is
apprehended, prevent a sale under a junior execution. The sheriff would
probably pay into court out of the proceeds a sum sufficient to abide the
result of the appeal, or the court might stay the execution on other
terms, as above empowered.
NOTE 2. —When fines are imposed the judgment may be docketed and
become a lien under this section. Acts 1887, ch. 191, s. 3.
Lien of docketed judgments,— A docketed judgment is a lien upon the
lands of the debtor, although it does not divest the estate out of the
debtor, nor does it make the land primarily liable for the debt though
the lien exists. And where the debtor dies, the laud descends to the
heirs subject to the lien, which lien, however, is subject to the right of
the heirs to have the debt paid by the personal property, if there is
enough for that purpose; if there is not enough to pay the debt, then
the land may be sold for assets by the administrator. Murchison v.
Williams, 71-135.
Before the adoption of The Code, the levy of a senior execution on
land did not prevent a levy and sale under a junior execution, and a
purchaser at such sale obtained a good title. The Code has constituted
a docketed judgment a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor,
and a purchaser at a sale under a junior docketed judgment acquires
the estate subject to the lien of any prior docketed judgmeut. A judg
ment obtained before the adoption of The Code, if docketed within a
reasonable time thereafter, acquired a lien upon the real estate of the judgment debtor. Such judgments were not prejudiced by the adoption
of The Code. Sharpe v. Williams, 76-87.
Where a purchaser at a sale under a decree of foreclosure, or a pur
chaser at execution sale, obtains a deed for a tract of laud lying in two
counties, and the mortgage was registered or the judgment docketed
only in one county, such deed conveys no title as against creditors or
purchasers for value to that part of the land lying in the other county.
King v. Portis, 77-25.
A foreclosure sale under a mortage of laud lying in two counties, the
mortgage being registered in but one, passes title to the land in both as
against a purchaser under a judgment docketed, subsequently to the
foreclosure proceedings, in the county where the mortgage was not reg
istered. King v. Portis, 81-382, overruling King v. Portis, 77-25.
A judgment for costs against a defendant and in favor of the officers
of the court, when docketed, is a lien to tire same extent as a judgment
in favor of the plaintiff. Sheppard v. Bland, 87-163.
A judgment has no lien on land in a county in which it has not been
docketed. Lowdermilk v. Corpening, 92-333.
The lien of a judgment cannot be continued by subrogation when the
judgment has been satisfied, nor against a party who acquired rights
before the action in which the judgment of subrogation was rendered
was begun, nor can such subrogation impair the rights of persons not
parties to the action. Ibid.
A docketed judgment is not a lien on real property purchased and
paid for by a debtor when title is taken in the name of a third person.
Dixon v. Dixon, 81-323; Wall v. Fairly, 77-105.
A judgment for purchase-money has no higher lien than any other,
except that the homestead cannot be claimed against a debt for its pur
chase. Moore v. Ingram, 91-376.
A judgment creditor has neither jus in re nor jus ad rem as to a debtor's
land, but only the right to enforce his judgment by execution. If the
debtor has made an agricultural lien or severed the crop, that does not
pass to purchaser at execution sale. Dail v. Freeman, 92-351.
Lien, from what time. —The judgment is a lien upon land at and from
the time of its being docketed. Harris v. Ricks, 63-653; Hoppock v.
Shober, 60-153.
The effect of the act suspending The Code, is to make the clerk sim
ply the instrument of the judge in entering up judgments, and the pro
visions in regard to docketing judgments in the courts where they are
taken, are suspended thereby, and the 18th rule of the supreme court
now regulates the same. Norwood v. Thorp, 64-682.
Judgments docketed during a term of a superior court in the county
in which they are taken, are deemed to have been docketed on the first
day of such term. Ibid. See Burton v. Spiers.
A judgment refers back to the first day of a term at which it was ren
dered, independent of the C C P. Farley v. Lea, 20-169; Foust v.
Trice, 53-490; Finley v. Smith, 24-225. Contra, Clifton v. Wynne, 81-169.
It is the docketing of the judgment, and not the issuing of the execu
tion, which creates the lien under the present system. Sawyer v. Saw
yer, 93-321; Williams v. Weaver, 94-134; Holman v. Miller, 103-118.
Time during appeal. —If there is an appeal after docketing judgment,
the time of stay caused by the appeal is not counted. Adams v. Guy,
106-275.
Lien and equitable interest. —Where a debtor executes a deed in trust to
a trustee to secure certain debts therein mentioned, and after the regis
tration of the deed, a creditor obtains judgment, and has the same duly docketed, the judgment, under the provisions of this section, is a lien
upon the equitable estate of the debtor. The lien, thus acquired, can
not be enforced hy a sale under execution. In order to sell an equitable
estate, not liable to sale under execution, the plaintiff in the execution
must resort to his action (as formerly, to bill in equity,) to ascertain the
rights of all parties interested, and to enforce his lien. McKeithan v.
Walker, 66-95; Sprinkle v. Martin, 66-55; Hardin v. Ray, 94-456; Trim
ble v. Hunter, 104-129.
A docketed judgment is a lien on the debtor's whole interest, legal or
equitable, but the equitable interest cannot be levied upon and sold
except as authorized by act of 1812. Mauney v. Ihrie, 76-299; Ledbetter v. Anderson, 62-323.
Priority of lien. —The United States government has an undoubted right
to priority of payment in case of a general conveyance of his property
by an insolvent, but that right is subject to a prior lien, and if a lien be
acquired by a docketed judgment, it will not be defeated by a subse
quent assignment, unless the insolvent be thrown into bankruptcy by
proceedings commenced within four months thereafter. Hoppock v.
Shober, 69-153.
If a sale of land is made under a junior docketed judgment, the pur
chaser buys, in effect, only an equity of redemption; that is, the title to
the land upon paying off prior liens. Halyburton v. Greeulee, 72-316;
Isler v. Colgrove, 75-334; Cannon v. Parker, 81-320.
A sale under both a senior and a junior docketed judgment, vests the
title in the purchaser, and transfers the liens in the same order of pri
ority, to the proceeds of the sale. Cannon v. Parker, 81-320.
The lien of a prior docketed judgment is not disturbed by a sale under
a junior judgment. Worsley v. Bryan, 86-343.
A sheriff is liable upon his official bond for a failure to apply proceeds
of sale of a debtor's land in payment of an execution, in his hands at
the time of sale, issued upon a judgment bearing the prior lien. The
lien upon land acquired by docketing a judgment cannot' be displaced
by one subsequently acquired. (The rights of the party' under the
judgment and execution of the supreme court were lost by not issuing
alias executions.) Titman v. Rhyne, S9-64.
Lien, how lost. —Quare, whether a lien created by a levy prior to the
docketing of a judgment, is continued by virtue of such docketing
without following it with a venditioni exponas; or whether the issuing
of an execution on such docketed judgment waives the lien created by
the levy before docketing. Baldwin v. York/.? 1-463.
The lien on the land of the defendant acquired by a docketed judg
ment shall not be lost in favor of a judgment subsequently docketed,
unless the plaintiff in the latter take out execution, and give the plain
tiff in the former twenty days' notice before the day of sale by the
sheriff, and the plaintiff so notified fails to take out execution and put it
into the sheriff's hands before the day of sale, as is prescribed in the 19th
rule of practice, adopted by the supreme court at June term, 1869,
(63-669). Perry v. Morris, 65-221; Daugherty v. Logan, 70-558.
Docketing the judgment alone creates a lien on land and if land is
sold under a junior judgment it may be sold over again under a senior
judgment. This lien is a vested right and the rule adopted June term,
1869 (63 N. C, 669). is unconstitutional. Burton v. Spiers. 92-503.
The lien acquired by a judgment obtained before the C. C. P., upon
which execution issued and was levied upon land and kept alive by suc
cessive alias executions, issued from term to term, was not waived or
lost by docketing a transcript of such judgment in another county.
Isler v. Colgrove, 75-334.
The lien under this section is lost by the lapse of ten years after
docketing, although execution is regularly issued. Pasour v. Rhyne,
S2-149.
Where an execution is levied on land before the 'expiration of the
judgment lien, but the sale does not take place until after the expira
tion of such lien, the levy does not extend the lien to the sale, so as to
defeat a purchaser or prior encumbrancer whose right attached during
the existence of the lien, but before the levy. Spicer v. Gambill, 93 -37s;
Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683.
The lien of a judgment expires at the end of ten years from the time
it is docketed. The only provision which extends this time is that con
tained in this section. Lilly v. West, 97-276.
Supersedeas bond. —A bond to stay execution which provides that the
obligors will be responsible for any damages which may arise on account
of the acts of the appellant in committing waste, etc., is not a superse
deas bond within the meaning of 43.S, 554, which contemplate a bond
upon which summary judgment may be rendered in the supreme court
upon the affirmation of the judgment of the court below. Alderman v.
Rivenbark, 96M34.
Duty of judgment creditor.—It is the duty of a judgment creditor to see
that his judgment isptoperly docketed. If the clerk neglects to docket
the judgment, subsequent incumbrances and claimants under the judg
ment debtor are not to be prejudiced thereby, and the remedy of the
judgment creditor is against the clerk for loss suffered by reason of the
failure to docket the judgment. Holman v. Miller, 103-118.
A sale of land under execution issued more than ten years after the
docketing of the judgment is invalid. The purchaser at such sale is
affected with notice of the expiration of the judgment lien, and gets no
title. Lyon v. Russ. 84-5S8; Pasour v. Rhyne, 82-149.
A, B and C had all taken judgments against I). A's judgment was
never docketed; B's was docketed in June, 1869; C's was docketed in
January, 1878. Executions issued on all these judgments, bearing teste
fall. 1879: Held, (1) that A. having never docketed his judgment, had
no lien to compete for the fund against the other two; (2) that B's judg
ment had ceased to be a lien by the lapse of ten years from the day it
was docketed; (3) that C's judgment should be first paid out of the pro
ceeds of the execution sale. Whitehead v. Latham, 83-232.
The lien of a docketed judgment is lost by the lapse of ten years.
Fox v. Kline, 85-173; McDonald v. Dixon, 85-248. Except as to the
lieu upon the interest in reversion of the homestead. Cotten v. McClenahan, 85-254.
See I 152 (1), ante, and cases there cited.
When not a lien. —A docketed judgment is no lien on real property
which has been paid for by the debtor, but title taken in the name of a
third person. Dixon v. Dixon, 81-323; Wall v. Fairly, 77-105.
A docketed judgment against an administrator in his executive capacity,
when administration was granted prior to July I, 1869, created no lien
upon his land. Williams v. Green, 80-76.
Assignment of judgment,—An assignment of a judgment is not necessa
rily to be entered on the docket. Winberry v. Koonce, 83-351.
Requirement as to teste of execution. —The act of assembly, i87o-'r, ch.
42, by which executions issued on judgments in civil actions are required
to be tested as of the term next before the day on which they are issued,
is merely directory, and its omission does not vitiate the process. Bryan
v. Hubbs, 69-423.
See \ 449, post.
Judgments by default.—Qucere: How are judgments by default, now
allowed by law, and the amounts thereof, ascertained? Is it in the man
ner prescribed in \ 385, ante, or is it by the old mode of a jury and a writ
of inquiry? Sutton v. McMillan, 72-102.
See \\ 385, 386, ante, and cases cited.
Purchaser under an execution unaffected by irregularity in the judgment. —
In an action of ejectment, the plaintiff who, is a stranger to the judgment
need only show the execution under which the land was sold, in order
to establish his title against the defendant in the execution; nor is his
title affected by any irregularity in the judgment. Lee v. Bishop, 89-256.
Judgment, how kept alive. —A judgment can be kept alive by the issuance
of executions within each successive period of three years from the issue
of the previous execution. Williams v. Mullis, 87-159.
See it 436 and 440, post.
Remedy upon judgments nisi. —The proper mode of enforcing judgments
nisi is by action or special proceedings commenced by summons. Jones
v. Gupton, 65-48.
Note. —This is now otherwise, and the remedy is by motion, upon
notice, \ 446, post.
Judgments of one superior court docketed in another.—Where a judgment
was rendered in one county and docketed in another, proceedings sup
plementary to execution should be instituted in the county in which the
judgment was rendered, as the action is pending in that county until the
judgment is satisfied. Hutchinson v. Symons, 67-156.
The fact that a judgment docketed in one county is afterwards dock
eted in another does not deprive it of the lien it had on the defendant's
land in the first county. Perry v. Morris, 65-221.
The transcript of a judgment sent from one county to another to be
docketed which sets out the date of its rendition, the names of the par
ties to the suit, the amount of the debt, and the costs of action, is suffi
cient to give notice of the lien on the defendant's land. Wilson v. Patton, 87-318.
Justice's judgments docketed in the superior court. —A judgment given by
a justice of the peace in one county, cannot be docketed in another with
out having been first docketed in the county where it was rendered.
McAden v. Banister, 63-47S.
The provision for docketing a justice's judgment in the office of the
clerk of the superior court of the county, so as to make it a judgment of
the superior court, from the time of its being docketed, is not repealed
by the act of i868-'9, ch. 76, entitled "an act suspending the Code of
Civil Procedure in certain cases." Bates v. Bank, 65-81.
If a justice's judgment be docketed in the superior court, it will be alien
upon the land of the defendant from the time it was docketed, and will
have a priority over a judgment obtained in such court by another person
against the same defendant at a subsequent time, and though an execu
tion be issued on the latter, and the sheriff levies it on the land and
advertises it for sale, yet, if before the sale execution is issued on a part
of the justice's docketed judgment, and is placed in the hands of the
sheriff, the proceeds of the sale of the land must be first applied to the
payment of all the justice's judgment. Perry v. Morris, 65-221.
A justice's judgment is docketed in the superior court for the purpose
of lien and execution, and that court has no power to set it aside, unless
the cause is carried up by appeal or recordari. A judgment can only be
vacated by the court which rendered it. Morton v. Rippy, 84-611.
The docketing of a dormant justice's judgment in the superior court
does not have the effect of reviving it, but merely brings it within the
operation of the rules applicable to original judgments in that court. If
not removed, a new action would have been necessary to revive it, there
fore qucrre as to whether the transfer to the superior court should not be
made before the dormancy of the judgment. Williams v. Williams,
85-383.
A transcript of a justice's judgment, sent up to be docketed in the
superior court, need not contain more than the essential particulars con
stituting the judgment. And where the justice authenticates it by his
certificate, it will be regarded as having been regularly taken, in the
absence of proof to the contrary, though the judgment itself is not signed
by the justice. No levy is necessary on real estate. Docketing the
judgment creates the lien. Surratt v. Crawford, 87-372.
A transcript of a justice's judgment containing the names of the plain
tiff and defendant, the amount of the judgment, and the costs of action,
is sufficient. The law does not require the entire record to be sent up to
be docketed. Lee v. Bishop, 89-256.
The docketing of a magistrate's judgment in the superior court is
prima facie evidence of its existence. Such judgments, regularly dock
eted, cannot be collaterally impeached. Moore v. Edwards, 92-43.
A judgment rendered by a justice of the peace becomes dormant at
the expiration of a year from its rendition, and docketing it in the
superior court after that period does not restore its validity. It can only
be revived by a new action before a justice of the peace. Woodard v.
Paxton, 101-26.
A judgment docketed in the superior court, as prescribed by statute,
becomes "a judgment of the superior court in all respects." Leave to
issue execution upon a judgment so docketed may be granted at any
time within ten years from the docketing. Adams v. Guy, 106-275;
Broyles v. Young, 81-315; Cannon v. Parker, 81-320; Mcllhenny v. Trust
Co., 108-31 1.
But an action on such judgment would be barred in seven years.
Daniel v. Laughlin, 87-433; Broyles v. Young, 81-315.
See \ 152 (1), ante, and cases cited.
Injunctions against judgments. —When the affidavit alleges that one of
the defendants, who is the plaintiff's debtor, has conspired with the
other to give him his bond without substantial consideration, and allow
judgment and execution thereon, in order to defraud the plaintiff, the
injunction will be continued to the hearing, although the defendants
may deny the fraud in their answer. Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612.
That the part)- failed to sustain his defence in an action through the
unexpected absence of the nominal plaintiff, whom he had subpoenaed
as a witness, is no ground for an injunction against the judgment in such
action. Wilder v. Lee, 64-50.
It is no ground for injunction against a judgment obtained by the
assignee of a bankrupt bank that the defendant, "being unable to obtain
the bills of the bank," had tendered, in discharge of the judgment, onehalf its amount in currency, which was alleged to be the value of such
bills. Smith v. Dewey, 64-463.

able neglect, mistake or surprise.

Sec.4-'{(i. Judgment in supreme court may be docketed in
superior court; lien of Judgment ; when transcript, may
be obtained. 1881, c. 7~>, ss. 1, 4.
It shall be the duty of the clerk of the supreme court,
on application of the party obtaining judgment in said
court, directing, in whole or in part, the payment of money,
or affecting the title to real estate, or, on the like applica
tion of the attorney of record of said party, to certify, under
his hand and the seal of said court, a transcript of said
judgment, setting forth the title cf said court, the names
of the parties thereto, the relief granted, that said judg
ment was so rendered by said court, the amount and date
of said judgment, what part thereof bears interest, and
from what time; and said clerk shall send such certificate
and transcript to the clerks of the superior court of such
counties as he may be directed, and the clerk of the supe
rior court receiving the said certificate and transcript shall
docket the same in like manner as judgment-rolls of the
superior court may be docketed; and, when so docketed,
the lien of said judgment shall bs the same in all respects,
be subject to the same restrictions and qualifications, and
the time shall be reckoned as is provided and prescribed in
the preceding sections for judgments of the superior court,
so far as the same may be applicable. The party desiring
the certificate and transcript provided for in this section
may obtain the same at any time after such judgment has
been rendered, unless the supreme court shall otherwise
direct.
Lien of judgment of supreme court. —The simple rendition of a judgment
in the supreme court will not constitute a lien upon the judgment debt
or's laud. To create such a lien, it is essential that the judgment shall
be "docketed" in the county in which the land is situate, as directed
by the statute. Alsop v. Moseley, 104-60.
An execution issuing from the supreme court, upon a judgment
obtained therein, to a county in which the defendant has land, is a
lien upon the land from its teste. Rhyne v. McKee, 73-259.
Note.—This latter decision was made prior to the adoption of this
ic (436), and it is apprehended is not now the law. See Alsop v. Moseley,
supra.
Sec.
(a). Judgments in United States courts may be
docketed in superior courts; lien of Judgments; duty of
clerks of superior courts. 1889, c. 439.
Judgment and decrees rendered in the circuit and dis
trict courts of the United States within this state may be
docketed on the judgment dockets of the superior courts
in the several counties of this state for the purpose of
creating liens of such judgments and decrees upon property
within the county where the same may be so docketed, in like
manner as the judgments of said superior courts may be dock
eted, for the purpose of creating liens upon property, but
in no other manner, extend or order as contemplated, pro
vided and intended by the act of congress entitled "an act
to regulate the liens of judgments and decrees of the courts
of the United States" approved August 1st, 1888. And
it shall be the duty of the clerks of the said superior courts,
when a judgment sale of said circuit and district courts
shall be filed with him, to docket the same as judgments
of the said superior courts are required to be docketed.
Lien of United States judgments.—Prior to the enactment of congress in
the act of August 1, 1888, to regulate the liens of judgments of the
courts of the United States, and of the concurring act of the general
assembly of North Carolina (ch. 439, Laws 1889). the only way by which
a judgment rendered in the Federal courts could acquire a lien on the
debtor's real property was by suing out a final process and enforcing it
in accordance with the practice which prevailed in this state anterior to
the passage of the law which provides for the acquisition of a lien by
docketing the judgment. Nor did the act of congress of June, 1872,
entitled "an act to further the administration of justice," in the absence
of the adoption of any of the rules there authorized, by the Federal
courts in North Carolina, create any lien in favorof judgments rendered
in those courts. Alsop v. Moseley, 104-60.
Sec. 437' Executions within three years of course, C. C.
P., s. 255.
The party in whose favor judgment has been heretofore
or shall hereafter be given, and in ease of his death, his
personal representatives duly appointed, may at any time
within three years after the entry of judgment, proceed to
enforce the same by execution, as provided in this chapter.
Against a county.—An execution does not issue upon a judgment
obtained against a county. The remedy is by mandamus. Gooch v.
Gregory, 65-142; Hughes v. Com'rs, 107-598.
On judgment in partition. —On a judgment in partition, charging the
more valuable lots with sums to make equality of partition, execution
will issue, except as to minors, against whose property execution is sus
pended until their becoming of age. Turpin v. Kelly, 85-399.
On dormant judgment Execution can issue on a dormant judgment
only after notice, motion and proof, as provided in this chapter. Wil
liams v. Williams, 85-383; Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683.
Issued after death of judgment debtor. —An execution issued after death
of the judgment debtor is void, and no title passes to a purchaser at a
sale under such an execution; and this is so, although the judgment was
obtained on causes of action accruing prior to the adoption of the Code
of Civil Procedure. Williams v. Weaver, 94-134; Sawyers v. Sawyers,
93-321For owelty of partition. —The proper remedy to enforce a charge of
owelty in partition is by writ of venditioni exponas, granted upon motion
or petition in the original proceeding, and a new action begun should
be dismissed, unless in possible cases involving complicated litigation.
Herman v. Watts, 107-646; Waring v. Wadsworth, 80-345; Halso v. Cole,
82-161; Turpin v. Kelly, 85-399; Dobbin v. Rex, 106-444; Meyers v. Rice,
107-24.
Levy upon exempted property. —It is not error to refuse to set aside an
execution, upon the allegation that exempted land has been levied on
and sold thereunder. Hasty v. Simpson, 84-590.
Teste of execution. —The act of assembly, i87o-'7i, ch. 42 (<S 449, post),
by which executions issued on judgments in civil actions, are required
to be tested as of the term next before the day on which they are issued,
is merely directory, and its omission does not vitiate the process. Bryan
v. Huggs, 69-423.
See \ 449, post.
Sec. 438. Afterjudgment parti/ may jut if the same, although
110 execution has been issued. 11. (J., e. 31, s. 127' . 1823,
c. 1212, s. 1.
The party against whom any judgment for the payment
of money may be. rendered, by any court of record, may
pay the whole, or any part thereof, to the clerk of the court
in which the same may have been rendered, at any time
thereafter, although no execution may have issued 011 such
judgment ; and such payment of money shall be good and
available to the party making the same, and the clerk shall
enter the payment on the judgment docket of the court,
and immediately forward a certificate thereof to the clerk
of the superior court of each county to whom a transcript
of said judgment has been sent, and the clerk of such supe
rior court shall enter the same on the judgment docket of
such court, and file the original with the judgment-roll in
the action.
The clerk, when agent of judgment creditor. —Acts from which such an
agency in the clerk, beyond what the law, under this section, gives him,
may be implied, must be such as under the circumstances are reasonably
calculated to induce the debtor to believe that the clerk was the creditor's
agent for the purpose. Purvis v. Jackson, 69-474.
While execution in hands of sheriff. — A debtor may pay money (on a judg
ment) to the clerk of the court before an execution issues, or after it has
been returned, but not while it is in the hands of the sheriff. Bynumv.
Barefoot, 75-576.
Sec. 439. Cleric to pay the money to the party entitled. R.
C, c. 31, s. 128. 1823, c. 1212, s. 2.
The clerk, to whom money shall be paid as aforesaid,
shall pay the same to the party entitled to receive it, under
the same rules and penalties as if the money had been paid
into his office by virtue of an execution.
Sec. 440. After three years, to be issued only by leave of
court; It.are, how obtained. ('. C. t'., s. 2i>O.
After the lapse of three years from the entry of judgment,
an execution can be issued only by leave of the court, upon
• motion, with personal notice to the adverse party, unless
he be absent or non-resident, or cannot be found to make
such service, in which case such service may be made by
publication, or in such other manner as the court shall
direct. Such leave shall not be given unless it be estab
lished by the oath of the party, or by other satisfactory
proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, remains
unsatisfied and due. But the leave shall not be necessary
when execution has been issued on the judgment within
the three years next preceding the suing for execution, and
return thereof unsatisfied in whole or in part.
Jurisdiction of the application.—The clerk of the superior court is the
proper person to hear an application to issue an execution upon a judg
ment of more than three years' standing, and not the judge. The exe
cution in such case must be made returnable to the next term. McKeithan v. McNeill, 74-663.
Affidavit. —This affidavit can be made by a party in interest, although
the judgment debtor is dead. Latham v. Dixon, 82-55.
An affidavit that the judgment is unsatisfied is not necessary. It is
sufficient if it appears by any other satisfactory proof. Surratt v. Craw
ford, 87-372.
In an application to revive a dormant judgment, the affidavit of the
judgment creditor is not the only evidence upon which the clerk may
proceed, and when the judgment debtor is present and makes no objection
to the order it is sufficient evidence to warrant the revival of the judg
ment, although the judgment creditor does not make an affidavit at all.
H in ton v. Roach, 95-106.
The affidavit of the judgment debtor is competent, on the motion to
issue execution, to prove that he had paid the judgment to the intestate.
Pate v. Oliver, 104-458.
Notice of application. —Notice of a motion for leave to issue execution
against a corporation served upon its president, or managing board, or others (named in \ 217, ante) is sufficient. The " personal notice " is in
contradistinction to that by publication. Rush v. Steamboat Co., 84-703.
That personal notice was given to the defendant is determined by the
granting the leave asked for, when there is no proof made that notice
was not given. Surratt v. Crawford, 87-372.
Death of judgment debtor. —When a party dies after judgment, the
action abates, just as it would before judgment. In such case, notice
of a motion to revive must be served on his personal representative.
Aycock v. Harrison, 71-432. This case was in regard to an action in
which judgment was had in 1861. Under \ 1S8 of The Code an action
is only abated by order of the court. See Moore v. Railroad, 74-52S,
and other cases cited under «• 188, ante.
In a motion for leave to issue executiou upon a judgment obtained in
the life-time of the defendant's testator, and which is a lien upon his
lands, his heirs are necessary parties. Isler v. Murphy, 71-436.
This section does not apply where the judgment debtor is three years
deceased, such cases falling under C. C. P., \ 319. Lee v. Eure, 82-428.
Note. —Section 319 is repealed not having been brought forward in
The Code. Lilly v. West, 97-276; Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321.
Issued every three years. —When execution is regularly issued within
less interval thau three years it does not become dormant. Perkins v.
Berry, 103-131.
On dormant judgment. —An execution issued on a dormant judgment
is irregular, but not void, and a stranger, without notice, at a sale under
such execution, gets a good title, but if the judgment creditor, or a
stranger with notice purchases, he gets no title. Under the former
practice, the only defence to a scire facias issued to revive a dormant
judgment, was payment or satisfaction. Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683.
Upon justices' judgments. —Leave to issue execution on a justice's judg
ment docketed in the superior court can be granted after the lapse of
seven years from such docketing, but before the lapse of ten years.
Broyles v. Young, 81-315; Daniel v. Laughlin, S7-433; Adams v. Guy,
106-275.
Leave may be granted, when.—Leave to issue execution may be granted
when it is established that the judgment has not been entirely satisfied,
and that it is not barred by the statute of limitations. Johnston v. Jones,
87-393Motion for leave to issue execution to revive a dormant judgment
may be granted plaintiff, though he may have brought another action
for same debt and recovered judgment therein. McLean v. McLean,
9°-53°After lapse of ten years. —Execution may be issued after the lapse of ten
years from the docketing of the judgment where the judgment has been
kept alive by issuing executions within each successive period of three
years, and a levy and sale of personal property under it are valid. Wil
liams v. Mullis, 87-159.
The statute of limitations may be pleaded by an administrator to a
motion for leave to issue execution after ten years from the date of dock
eting judgment against his intestate, although execution may have
been issued regularly within each successive period of three years.
Berry v. Corpening, 90-395.
Where a judgment has become dormant and is more than ten years
old, no execution can issue on it unless the creditor gives to the debtor
an opportunity to set up the statutory bar. So, where a judgment was
more than ten year sold, and no execution had issued within three years,
and the creditor issued a notice of a motion to issue execution, and the
clerk made no order to that effect, but issued the execution: It was
held that a sale thereunder was void. Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683.
The motion for leave to issue execution is made in apt time, though
the ten years expired pending the appeal, and though it appears that
no undertaking was given. Adams v. Guy, 106-275.
Bankruptcy not a bar to the application, when. —A discharge in bank
ruptcy, obtained before judgment is taken in a cause, and not then
pleaded in bar, cannot be pleaded in bar of a motion to re-issue execu
tion on such judgment. Bell v. Cunningham, 81-83; Sanderson v.
Daily, 83-67.
What is a bar to the application. —A discharge in bankruptcy can be
pleaded in bar to this motion, without regard to the length of time that
has elapsed. Dawson v. Hartsfield, 79-334. And though the judgment was
obtained after the adjudication, if upon a debt in existence when adju
dication granted. Ibid; and Withers v. Stinson, 79-341; Blum v. Ellis,
"3-293....
The statute of limitations is a complete bar to a motion for leave to
issue execution when such motion is made more than ten years after
the rendition of the judgment. McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248; Wil
liams v. Mullis, 87-159.
If motion refused, it cannot be renewed. —Where this motion is made and
refused without any appeal being taken, it cannot be renewed. Sander
son v. Dailey, 83-67.
This section applies, when.—This section applies to transcripts of jus
tices' judgments docketed in the superior court. Broyles v. Young,
81-315- .
Execution can only issue after the lapse of three years since the
issuance of the last execution, by complying with the requirements of
this section. Williams v. Williams, 85-383.
Sec. 441. Judgments, how enforced. C. C. P., s. 257.
Where a judgment requires the payment of money, or
the delivery of real or personal property, the same may be
enforced in those respects by execution, as provided in this
title. Where it requires the performance of any other act,
a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the
party against whom it is given, or upon the person or officer
who is required thereby or by law to obey the same, and
his obedience thereto enforced. If he refuse, he may be
punished by the court as for contempt.
Real estate of corporation. —Real estate of a corporation, necessary for
public uses, cannot be sold under execution separate from its franchise.
Gooch v. McGee, 83-59.
Receipt of money by sheriff. —When a sheriff receives monev in pay
ment of an execution, the law makes the application, and it is a satis
faction of the judgment. Motz v. Stowe, 83-434.
Against an administrator.—After a judgment fixing an executor with
assets and a return of nulla bona on an execution issued thereon, the
proper mode to subject such executor personally is by motion on notice
and not by a civil action. McDowell v. Asbury, 66-444.
The provision in the Code of Civil Procedure, furnishing a remedy for
enforcing the lien in case the administrator unreasonably delays settling
the estate, has not been brought forward in The Code. Lilly v. West,
97-276; Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321.
Against a distributee. —Where, iu an action brought on a note given,
with surety, by a distributee of an estate to the administrator, it was
adjudged that the administrator recover the amount of the note, but
that no execution issue until the clerk should determine the amount of
the distributive share of the principal debtor in the estate on the final
accounts of the same, and such amount should be credited before issu
ing execution, it was competent for the court, at a subsequent term,
upon a report of the clerk in this action that nothing was due on the
distributive share, there being no exception, to modify the judgment
and order execution to issue, notwithstanding that, iu proceedings by
the administrator against the distributees for a filial settlement, there
was a report of the clerk that nothing was due 011 said distributive
share, and an appeal from a judgment confirming the report. Scroggs
v. Alexander, 103-162.
After death of judgment debtor.—Where a judgment debtor dies, the
creditor cannot enforce the judgment by execution, but must collect his
debt in the regular course of the administration of the estate. Sawyers
v. Sawyers, 93-321.
If personal assets insufficient, the judgment creditor will be first
entitled to have his judgment satisfied out of the proceeds of the land
to which the lien adheres. Lilly v. West, 97-276; Murchison v. Wil
liams, 81-135; Mauney v. Holmes, 87-42S: Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321.
After lapse of ten years from docketing. —If an execution issue more than
ten years after the docketing of the judgment, a sale of both real and
personal property under it is valid, but in such case it is only a lien on
both real and personal property from the levy, and not from the teste of
the execution. Williams v. Mullis, 87-159; Spicer v. Gambill, 93-37S;
Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683.
Dormant judgment. — In an action brought to recover possession of land,
to which title was derived under execution sale, the defendant set up an
equitable defence, and asked, as affirmative relief, that the sale be set
aside upon the ground that the judgment upon which the execution was
issued was dormant, and for irregularities in the sale, which relief was
granted, but it appearing that the judgment, though dormant, was a lien
upon the land: Held, that the court having acquired jurisdiction of the
equities arising between the parties, might proceed to enforce the lien
of the judgment by judicial sale. Currie v. Clark, 101-321.
Variance between judgment and execution.—A variance between the exe
cution and the judgment, in regard to the sum due, does not vitiate a
sale under the execution. Hintou v. Roach, 95-106.
Costs. —The prevailing party in an action may be adjudged to pay the
costs incurred in an unsuccessful attempt to enforce his judgment. Mor
ris v. Luther, 101-196.
Power of supreme court. —The supreme court has no power to compel
a defendant, by attachment, to apply money he is said to possess to the
payment of a judgment for costs recovered against him by the plaintiff
in the court. The provisions in regard to supplemental proceedings
(I 488 to if, 500, post), are only applicable to the superior courts. Phillips
v. Trezevant, 70-176.
The jurisdiction conferred upon the supreme court by art. 4, £ 9 of the
constitution, to hear claims against the state, is confined to an examina
tion of and adjudication of the legal validity of such claims; no power
to enforce its judgment is given the court; its decisions are merely
recommendatory to the legislature, who may provide for the judgment
of the claims, if it sees proper to do so. Baitzer v. State, 104-265.
Sec. 442. The different k inds of execution. C. C. P., s. 25S.
There shall be three kinds of execution : one against the
property of the judgment debtor, another against his per
son, and the third for the delivery of the possession of real
or personal property, or such delivery with damages for
withholding the same. They shall be deemed the process
of the court, and shall be subscribed by the clerk, and,
when to run out of his county, must be sealed with the
seal of his court.
Execution may be recalled. —The clerk of the superior court has power
to recall an execution improperly issued. Alndge v Loftin, 104-122.
But if motion is denied, it is res judicata, and cannot be reviewed.
Moore v. Grant, 92-316.
While the courts of justices of the peace are not, strictly speaking,
courts of record, they possess and may exercise many of the powers of
such tribunals, e.g., they may recall executions improperly issued, and
cause satisfaction of judgments rendered by them to be entered. Bailey
v. Hester, 101-538.
If no order of arrest before judgment. —Where there is no order of arrest
before judgment, the defendant cannot be arrested under this section
after judgment. Houston v. Walsh, 79-35.
See Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-422; Finley v. Smith, 15-95.
Sec. 443. To what counties execution may be issued ; exe
cution against a married woman. C. C. P., s. 250.
When the execution is against the property of the judg
ment debtor, it may be issued to the sheriff of any county
where the judgment is docketed. When it requires the
delivery of real or personal property, it must be issued to
the sheriff of the county where the property, or some part
thereof, is situated. Executions may be issued at the same
time to different counties.
Real property adjudged to be sold must be sold in the
county where it lies, by the sheriff of the county, or bv a
referee appointed by the court for that purpose; and there
upon the sheriff or referee must execute a conveyance to
the purchaser, which conveyance shall be effectual to pass
the rights and interests of the parties adjudged to be sold.
An execution may issue against a married woman, and
it shall direct the levy and collection of the amount of the
judgment against her from her separate property, and not
otherwise.
Sale under an execution issued upon a judgment not docketed in the county. —
Title derived by purchase at a sheriff's sale under a judgment not dock
eted in the county where the land lies, avails nothing against a purchaser
for value from the defendant in the execution. Rollins v. Henry, 78-342.
Foreclosure sale. —This section does not apply to foreclosure sales. Kid
der v. Mcllhenny, 81-123; Mebane v. Mebane, 80-34.
Sec. 444. Execution* to issue from the court in which the
judgment was rendered, and return made to the same
court. 1871-"i, c. 74, s. 1. 1881, c. 75.
The executions provided in this chapter, and other pro
cess for the enforcement of such judgments, shall issue only
from the court in which the judgment for the enforcement
of such execution, other final process, or any of them may
issue, was rendered ; and such executions or other final
process against the property of the defendant or defendants,
or any one or more of them, may be issued under the seal
of the court to any county in which such last mentioned
judgment may be docketed ; and such executions or other
final process may issue to two or more counties at the same
time as now provided by law, and executions against the
person or persons of defendant or defendants, or any of
them, may issue to any one or more counties ; and the
returns of all such executions or other finai process shall be
made to the court of the county from which the same issued.
Seal necessary upon execution issued to another county. — An execution
issued to another county, and all proceedings under it, are void unless
it bears the seal of the superior court of the count)' where the judg
ment was taken. Taylor v. Taylor, 83-U6.
Execution against either or all of the debtors.—All defendants in judg
ments for the payment of money are, as to the judgment creditor, priu
cipal debtors, and the creditor may proceed to enforce his judgment by
execution against one or all, unless the verdict or judgment shows that
the relation of surety existed, and this is endorsed upon the execution.
ln that event, the officer must first proceed against the principal, as
directed by The Code, \\ 2100 and 2101. Gatewood v. Leak, 99-357.'
Proof of execution when lost. —Proof by the sheriff that he had an exe
cution in his hands at the time of sale, is competent when the execution
is lost. Ryan v. Martin, 91-464.
Return to what county.—The sheriff must make return to the superior
court of the county in which judgment was obtained. Watson v. Mitch
ell, 108-364.
Amendment of return. —A sheriff cannot contradict his return on an
execution, but if it is erroneous he may apply to the court to have it
corrected. Peebles v. Newsom, 74-473; Williams v. Sharpe, 70-582;
Walters v. Moore, 90-41.
kThe supreme court has power to allow an officer, to whom its process
has been delivered for execution, to amend his return thereof by the
correction of errors caused by inadvertence or honest mistake. Wil
liams v. Weaver, io1-i.
Duty of sheriff to make a return. —A sheriff is bound to return every
" process which comes into his hands, not void, with a statement of his
action under it, and, if he has not completely obeyed it, with a lawful
reason for his omission. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.

Sec. 445. Returns on executions to be noted on Judgment
docket, and in certain cases clerk to send copies. 1871-'2,
c. 74, s. 2. 1881, c. 75.
When any such execution shall be returned as herein
provided, the return of the sheriff or other officer shall be
noted by the clerk on the judgment docket; and when the
same shall be returned as satisfied, or partially satisfied, it
shall be the duty of the clerk of the court to which the
same is returned to send a copy of such last-mentioned
return, under his hand, to the clerk of the superior court
of each county in which such judgment is docketed, whose
duty it shall be to note such copy in his judgment docket,
opposite said judgment, and to file said copy, with the
transcript of the docket of said judgment, in his office.
Any clerk failing to send a copy of the payments on said
execution or judgment to the clerks of the superior court
of the counties wherein a transcript of the judgment has
been docketed, and any clerk failing to note said payment
on the judgment docket of his court, shall, on motion, be
fined one hundred dollars nisi for said failure, and said
conditional judgment shall be made absolute upon notice
to show cause at the succeeding term of the superior court
of his county.
Return endorsed. —Returns upon an execution endorsed by the officer
are admissible whenever the execution is competent evidence. Peebles
v. Pate, 90-348.
Return, prima facie. —The return of an officer reciting a levy is only
prima facie evidence of the fact. Perry v. Hardison, 99-21.
Payment to sheriff. —Payment made by an execution debtor to a sheriff
or other officer is effectual as against the creditor only where the officer,
at the time, has a judicial mandate to make the collection, unless, irre
spective of his office, the creditor has constituted him an agent for that
purpose. Bailey v. Hester, 101-538.
Satisfaction should be entered, when. —Where a judgment debtor placed
in the hands of the judgment creditor claims and other property to be
collected and converted into money and applied to the satisfaction of
the judgment, and the creditor collected the money, but failed to apply
it as agreed, upon the collection of the money an appropriation, ipso
facto, was made to the judgment, and satisfaction thereof should have
been entered. Moore v. Garner, 101-374.
Sec. 440. Xotice of judgment nisi, how given. 187 l-"4, c.
74, s. 4.
In all cases where any sheriff or other officer shall be
amerced for failure to make due return of any execution or
other process placed in his hands, or for any default what
soever in his office, and judgment nisi or otherwise for the
penalty or forfeiture in such cases made and provided shall
be entered, it shall be sufficient to give such sheriff notice,
according to law, under the hand of the clerk and seal of
the court where such judgment may be entered, of a motion
for a judgment absolute, or for execution, as the case may
be, aiioSno .other notice, summons or suit shall be necessary

and held in aid of a suir-or other proceedings already insti
tuted in court.
NoTH.—This section reverses rule laid down in Thompson v. Berry,
64-79.
Judgment absolute set aside. —A judgment absolute upon a judgment nisi
for the amercement of a sheriff can be set aside, like any other judgment,
upon excusable neglect shown. Francks v. Sutton, 86-78.
See \ 598, post, and cases cited.
Amercement.—This section authorizes an amercement only—not a civil
action. Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, 1os-74.
See. -447- Execution against the person, in what cased. C.
C. P., s. 200. 1891, c. 541.
If the action be one in which the defendant might have
been arrested, an execution against the person of the judg
ment debtor may be issued to any county within the state,
after the return of an execution against his property unsat
isfied in whole or in part. But no execution shall issue
against the person of a judgment debtor, unless an order
of arrest has been served, as provided in title nine, sub
chapter one of this chapter, or unless the complaint con
tains a statement of facts showing one or more of the
causes of arrest required by section two hundred and
ninety-one, whether such statement of facts be necessary
to the cause of action or not.
Note. —The last two lines were added by c. 541, acts 1891.
Prerequisites.—Where a docketed judgment is relied on as authority for
an arrest of the person by issue of execution therennder, it is necessary
that the affidavit and order of arrest of the magistrate should be dock
eted with the judgment. McAden v. Banister, 63-478.
The clerk cannot hear parol evidence of an order of arrest having
been issued by a justice of the peace of another county. Ibid.
Duty of clerk.—It is the duty of the clerk of the court, upon the appli
cation of the plaintiff, to issue, in proper cases, the execution against
the person. Kinney v. Laughenour, 97-325.
Summary judgment against sureties. —After judgment in an action in
which the defendant might have been arrested, and in which an order
of arrest was duly served, the plaintiff is entitled to a summary judg
ment against the sureties upon the defendant's undertaking—it appear
ing that execution has been issued against his property and person
without effect. Patton v. Gash, 99-280.
Cannot issue, when. —When a defendant has been arrested under a pro
visional order, upon a charge of concealment of his property, and
denies such fraud, and afterwards, by consent, judgment is entered for
the debt only, and the issue of fraud is not tried, execution cannot issue
against his person. Claflin v. Underwood, 75-485.
Cannot issue unless an order of arrest was, or could have, issued
before judgment. Houston v. Walsh, 79-35.
Section construed. —This section elaborately discussed and construed.
Peebles v. Foote, 83-102.
See 290, 291, 292, 293, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 448. Form of execution. C. C. P., 8. 261. 1868-'9, c.
148, 8. 1. 1870-' 1, c. 42, 8. 7.
The execution must be directed to the sheriff, or coroner
when the sheriff is a party or interested, subscribed by the
clerk of the court, and must intelligibly refer to the judg
ment; stating the county where the judgment-roll of trans
cript is filed, the names of the parties, the amount of the
judgment, if it be for money, and the amount actually due
thereon, and the time of docketing in the county to which
the execution is issued, and shall require the officer sub
stantially as follows :
Variance. —A variance between the execution and judgment in the sum
due, the manner in which it is due or the time does not affect the title
of a purchaser. Hinton v. Roach, 95-106.
Teste of execution.—The act of assembly, \ 449, post, by which execu
tions issued on judgments in civil actions are required to be tested as of
the term next before the day on which they are issued, is merely direc
tory, and its omission does not vitiate the process. Bryan v. Hubbs,
69-423; Williams v. Weaver, 94-134.
Against property—no lien on personal properly until levy.
(1) If it be against the property of the judgment debtor,
it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of
the personal property of such debtor; and if sufficient
personal property cannot be found, out of the real property
belonging to him on the day when the judgment was dock
eted in the county, or at any time thereafter; but no exe
cution against the property of the judgment debtor shall
be a lien on the personal property of such debtor, as against
any bona fide purchaser from him for value, or as against
any other execution, except from the levy thereof.
Year's support. —Personal property allotted to a widow as her year's
support is subject to seizure and sale under an execution issued upon a
judgment recovered against her deceased husband in his life-time, tested
before his death but issued thereafter. Grant v. Hughes, 82-216.
Note. —This was changed by chap. 42, acts 1SS0.
Effect of levy. —A levy on land, by virtue of an execution, may (the
court intimates) be an appropriation of the land requiring its sale before
resorting to other lands to which some equitable right has attached. If
this is not so, it is a mere nullity, for the lien is conferred by the docketing of the judgment. Barnes v. Hiatt, 87-315; Surratt v. Crawford,
S7-372; Farrior v. Houston, 100-369.
When an execution is issued on an undocketed judgment, or one
which has lost its lien on real estate by the lapse of time, it is a lien on
noth real and personal property from its levy. Sawyers v. Sawyers,
93-321.
If an execution issued on a judgment more than ten years after the
docketing, but which is not dormant, or to a county in which the judg
ment has never been docketed, a sale of both real and personal property
under it is valid, but the lien only relates to the levy. Lytle v. Lytle,
94-683.
An execution is rot a lien on the personal property of the judgment
debtor as against bona fide purchasers from its teste, but only from the
levy, Weisenfield v. McLean, 96-248.
Where there has been more than one constructive levy they should
be paid off in the order of the time they were made. Penland v.
L,eatherwood, 101-509.
When a levy is made upon personal property, the officer making the
levy thereby acquires a special property therein, which he holds for the
purpose of satisfying the execution in his hands, and after that has been
done he should apply the remainder of the proceeds of the sale to the
satisfaction of other executions in his hands at the time of the sale. Ibid.
If personal property has been seized by one officer under execution,
another officer, having executions also, may make a second or construc
tive levy, by going to the property and endorsing his levy on his pro
cess, but he has no right to take possession until the first levy is
satisfied; it is the duty of the first officer, having notice of the sub
sequent levy, to apply any surplus proceeds of his sale to the execu
tions so afterwards levied. Ibid.
Levy constructive payment, when. —A levy by the sheriff on goods, when
he allows them to remain in the hands of the debtor, or when the debtor
regains possession after seizure, against the will of the sheriff, is not
satisfaction of the execution. A levy is only held to be a constructive
payment to prevent a wrong, as where the sheriff seizes goods and will
not sell them. Alridge v. Loftin, 104-122; In re King, 13-341; Binford v. Alston, 15-351.
What constitutes a levy. —To constitute a levy a seizure is necessary.
If, from the nature of the property, au actual seizure is impossible, some
act as nearly equivalent to the seizure as practicable must be substituted
for it. Long v. Hall, 97-286.
While a levy may be made upon real property without the officer
being at or taking formal possession of it, it is necessary, to constitute a
valid levy on personal property, that the officer should go to it, and have
it in his power, to take possession of it, if necessary. Perry v. Hardison, 99-21.
As against junior execution creditors, it is necessary to the validity of
a levy of a senior execution upon personal property that the officer
should take into his possession and retain, either in person or by an
agent for that purpose, the property seized, until a sale. As against
other persons, including perchasers for value, a levy on personal prop
erty, by going to it, so as to have power to take it into his possession, if
the officer choses, and endorsing it on his process, will be good, though
actual possession may not have been acquired, or having been acquired,
the property is left in possession of the debtor. This section does not alter
the former law as to what is and what is not a levy, it only relates to the
period when the lien of the execution attaches. Sawyer v. Bray, 102-79.
Levy not necessary. —A sale of real estate under an execution issued on
a judgment which is a Hen thereon is valid without a levy. Farrior v.
Houston, 100-369.
Against property in hands of personal representative.
(2) If it be against real or personal property in the hands
of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants
of real property, or trustees, it shall require the officer to
satisfy the judgment out of such property.
After death of judgment debtor.—Under an execution tested prior to the
death of a testator (or intestate), though issued after the death, the
sheriff may proceed to sell the property. Aycock v. Harrison, 65-S;
Grant v. Newsom, 81-36; Halso v. Cole, 82-161.
Contra. —Williams v. Weaver, 94-134, and Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321,
hold that an execution issued after death of judgment debtor is void.
See 'i 440, ante, and cases cited.
Against the person.
(3) If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it
shall require the officer to arrest such debtor and commit
him to the jail of the county until he shall pay the judg
ment or be discharged according to law.
Execution against person. —Such execution should command the sheriff
to arrest the defendant and commit him to the jail of the county from
which it issued until he shall pay the judgment or be discharged accord
ing to law. Kinney v. Laughenour, 97-325.
See 'i 447, ante, and cases cited.
For delivery of specific property.
(4) If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or
personal property, it shall require the officer to deliver the
possession of the same, particularly describing it, to the
party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require
the officer to satisfy any costs, damages, rents or profits
recovered by the same judgment out of the personal prop
erty of the party against whom it was rendered, and the
value of the property for which the judgment was recov
ered, to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be
had, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found,
then out of the real property belonging to him on the day
when the judgment was docketed, or at any time thereafter,
and shall, in that respect, be deemed an execution against
property.
Recovery of real estate. —It is the modern practice, under a writ of pos
session, for the plaintiff to point out to the sheriff, at his peril, the land
recovered, and the sheriff puts him in accordingly. Johnson v. Nevill,
65-677. ,
Damages are recoverable up to the time of trial in an action of eject
ment. Whisenhunt v. Jones, 78-361.
If the jury find the plaintiff is entitled to the land, but do not find any
wrongful act done to it by the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover
damages or costs. Clarke v. Wagoner, 78-367.
Writ of assistance. —A writ of assistance is in the nature of an equitable
habere facias possessionem, and only issues out of courts of equity when
land has been sold under a decree and the terre-tenant refuses to give
possession to the purchaser. The writ is never granted except when the
case is clear and notice has been given to the person in possession of the
land. All that is required to obtain the writ as against the parties, and
those claiming under them by conveyance made pendente lite, is to show
a presentation of the deed, and a demand for the possession, and a
refusal. The demand for possession is in all cases necessary, but the
presentation of the deed may be waived by the conduct of the person in
possession. Knight v. Houghtaling, 94-408.
Notice of motion, however, is not necessary when the writ was granted
in open court without objection from counsel of defendant who were
present, and at the same term at which final judgment was rendered.
Coor v. Smith, 107-430.
Sec. 449. Executions tested as of preceding term, and
returnable to the next succeeding term. JSTO-'1, c. 42, s.
7; l87.'i-'4, c. 7.
All executions issued under this chapter shall be tested
as of the term next before the day on which they were
issued, and shall be returnable to the term of the court
next after that from which they bear teste, and no execu
tion against property shall issue until the end of the term
during which the judgment was rendered.
Teste. —The act of assembly, (this section) by which executions issued
on judgments in civil actions are required to be tested as of the term
next before the day on which they are issued, is merely directory, and
its omission does not vitiate the process. Bryan v, Hubbs, 69-423; Wil
liams v. Weaver, 94-134.
Under The Code system, an execution which is issued after the death
of the judgment debtor, although it bears teste before his death, con
fers no authority on the sheriff to sell, and a sale therennder is void;
but before the Code of Civil Procedure was adopted, a sale under such
an execution would have been valid. Williams v. Weaver, 94-134;
Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321.
The purchaser at a sale made after the death of a judgment debtor
under an execution issued before his death acquires a good title. The
ci.ark's code ok civil procedure.

fact that the purchaser in also the execution creditor does not render
such sale void, and, if voidable, it must be set aside by a directproceeding for that purpose, or upon answer setting forth facts sufficient to
evoke the equitable interposition of the court. Benners v. Rhinehart,
io7-7°5Return can be made on any day of the term.—The sheriff is allowed all the
days of the term to return an execution, unless he be ruled, upon motion
and cause shown, to return it on some intermediate day. Ledbetter v.
Arledge, 53-475; Person v. Newsom, 87-142.

The property, estate and effects of the judgment debtor,
not exempted from sale under the constitution and laws of
this state, may be levied on and sold under execution as
hereinafter prescribed :
For "Exemptions," see \ 501, post, and cases cited
For decisions under this section prior to 1868, see Rattle's Digest, vol.
1. PP- 533-568, and vol. 3, pp. 140-150.
(1) The goods, chattels, houses, lands, tenements and
other hereditaments, and real estate belonging to him.
Priorities. —Where a sheriff levies 011 property, but before the sale a
senior execution comes into his hands, he should apply the proceeds
of the sale to the senior execution. Allemong v. Allison, S-325; Green
v. Johnston, 9-309.
Where the conduct of the parties is bona fide a fierifacias of a senior
teste is entitled to a priority, and those of equal teste to an equality in
dividing the proceeds of sale made by the sheriff, without reference to
the time of their delivery to the sheriff, if delivered to him before the
return day and before the sale. Palmer v. Clarke, 13-354.
When several executions, issuing from different competent courts, are
in the hands of different officers, if the officer holding the junior exe
cution seizes property under it, the property so seized is not subject to
the execution of a senior execution in the hands of another officer.
Jones v. Judkins, 20-454.
Where executions, issued from different courts, are placed in the
hands of different officers, and the same property is levied upon and
sold by each, the first sale passes the title. Woodley v. Gilliam, 67-237.
Where land is sold under several executions, some issuing to enforce
personal debts and others to enfore a lien for equality of partition, the
latter have priority in the distribution of the proceeds. Thompson v.
Peebles, 85-418.
Money raised by a sale of land under execution must be applied to
the executions in the hands of the sheriff at time of sale in preference to
the claim of a prior docketed judgment creditor whose execution was
not in hand at that time. But the lien of such prior judgment on the
land is not affected thereby. Worsley v. Bryant, 86-343.
Note. —As to real estate, the lien now attaches from the docketing of
the judgment, and priorities are settled by the date of such docketing.
See \ 435, ante, and cases cited.
What purchaser acquires. —A purchaser under execution sale takes all
that belongs to the debtor, and nothing more. A greater estate or inter
est than the debtor owned caunot be conveyed thereby. Dail v. Free
man, 92-351.
A sale under an execution issued upon a judgment which is a lien on
all the debtor's property, vests in the purchaser only the interest of the
debtor at the time the judgment lien attaches, and if the debtor has no
interest subject to sale under execution the purchaser gets nothing.
Bristol v. Hallyburton, 93-384.
Crops before maturity. —Crops before maturity are not subject to sale
under execution. A purchaser of land at sale under execution against
the landlord acquires no title to the crops then growing, when the land
is in possession of tenant. Kesler v. Cornelison, 98-383; Dail v. Free
man, 92-351.
Remainders. —A vested remainder may be sold under execution, but a
contingent remainder cannot. Bristol v. Hallyburton, 93-384.
Irregularities in the judgment do not affect the title of purchaser at execution
sale. —Irregularities alleged to have occurred before the issuing of an
execution, or the dormancy of a judgment not known to the purchaser,
cannot invalidate his title. Barnes v. Hvatt, 87-315; Grier v. Rhvne,
67-338.
Requisites of a valid sale. — All that is essential to a valid sale of real
estate, under execution, is that the requirements of the law be observed,
and that it be fully made known at the sale, what property is being sold,
l.'arrior v. Houston, 100-369.
Duty of purchasers. —Purchasers at judicial sales are only required to
see that the court has jurisdiction and the judgment authorizes the sale;
and they will be protected against the errors and irregularities of the
court, and laches of the parties which they cannot see. Grimes v. Taft,
98-l93.
Invalid sale. —Where there is fraud and collusion between the sheriff
and the purchaser at execution sale, the sale is absolutely void, and such
defect may be taken advantage of by anyone interested in the property
sold; but when the fraud results from the conduct of the plaintiff alone,
as in suppressing, bidding, etc., there being no collusion between the
sheriff and the purchaser, the sheriff's sale passes the title, and the exe
cution debtor must seek his relief in equity. Burton v. Spiers, 92-503.
Where the sheriff's deed recited a sale under execution prior to the
acquisition of title by the judgment debtor, the purchaser acquired no
title. Gentry v. Callahan, 98-448.
A sale under execution issuing upon a judgment barred by the lapse
of time will not pass title. Coward v. Chastain, 99-443.
Sheriff's right of application. —A sheriff has a right, at his own peril, to
apply money raised by final process to any writ in his hands. Yarborough v. Bank, 13-23.
A sheriff is liable on his official bond for a failure to apply proceeds
of a sale of debtor's land in payment of an execution, in his hands at the
time of sale, issued upon a judgment having a prior lien. Titman v.
Rhyne, 89-64.
Execution and sale set aside, when. —The court cannot set aside an exe
cution for abuses of the sheriff in executing its commands. Nixon v.
Harrell, 50-76.
A sale under execution will not be set aside on the ground of inade
quacy of price, unless coupled with a suggestion of undue advantage,
fraud or mistake. The party complaining has the right to have the facts
found. The plaintiff in the execution, or any other interested person,
«iay make the motion to set aside the sale. Beckwith v. Mining Com
pany, 87-155.
An execution under which a stranger purchases will not ordinarily be
set aside upon the ground of irregularity, unless the purchaser has actual
notice of such irregularity. Sheppard v. Bland, 87—163.
Execution sales cannot be collaterally avoided because of irregulari
ties in the manner in which they have been conducted. Burton v.
Spiers, 92-503.
When, at execution sale, the plaintiff in the execution, or his attorney
or agent, or any other person affected with notice of such irregularity,
purchases, the sale may be set aside at the instance of the defendant in
the execution, by a direct proceeding for that purpose. Ibid.
Where a sale of land is made under a decree of court, it cannot be
collaterally impeached in an independent action brought to recover the
land. As long as the decretal order of sale and conveyance remain
unmodified, the conveyance authorized by it must also stand, and such
orders can only be impeached by a direct proceeding for that purpose.
Sumner v. Sessoms, 94-371.
Under the former practice a purchaser at an execution sale on a dormant
judgment, got a good title, when he was a stranger to the judgment. In
such case the dormant judgment was only voidable, and the sheriff was
bound to obey it, although it might be set aside at the instance of the
defendant, before property had been purchased under it. Ripley v.
Arledge, 94-467.
The proper remedy against the enforcement of a judgment by a party
thereto is not by an injunction, but by a proceeding in the cause, and a
supersedeas. Coward v. Chastain, 99-443.
Property of county. —Property acquired by a county for necessary pub
lic purposes cannot be sold under execution. Gooch v. Gregory, 65-142;
Hughes v. Com'rs, 107-598.
Where it appears that a mandamus has been answered by the county
commissioners and proven unavailable, because the constitutional limit
of taxation has been exhausted to meet the current expenses; and it fur
ther appears that the county holds real estate, or other property not used
or needful for its public functions, and, for any reason, such property
could not have been subjected, except by an equitable ft. fa. : It seems
that such property can be subjected for the discharge of the debt of a
judgment creditor against the county, though it cannot be levied on and
sold under execution. Hughes v. Com'rs, 107-598.
Change of decree of sale. —Where an interlocutory order, made by con
sent, directs the judicial sale of land, the parties to the action cannot
change the terms of the order by consent, in a manner detrimental to
the interest of a purchaser at such sale. Vaughan v. Gooch, 92-524.
When heirs must be brought in by sci. fi.—Lands cannot be sold under
a fi. fa. issued and bearing teste after the death of the debtor, without
bringing in the heirs by scire facias, and this though it is an alias fi. fa.
Wood v. Harrison, 18-356.
Personal property conveyed after levy. —Where the sheriff seizes personal
property uuder an execution, the right of the defendant is not absolutely
divested, but he can still sell and convey the property, subject to the
lien of the execution and levy. Popelston v. Skinner, 20-156.
Personal property left with defendant after levy. —An officer who levies on
personal property and leaves it in the possession of the defendant in the
execution only loses his lien against other executions under which the
property is seized and taken into possession. Mangum v. Hamlett,
30-44.
Sile under first execution protects purchaser and plaintiff. —The first execu
tion, finally acted on, protects both the purchaser under it and the plaintiffin it. Ricks v. Blount, 15-128.
Sale of real estate by defendant after judgment in another county. —Where
an original fi. fa. issued to one county and an alias to another, a sale by
the defendant of his property situate in the latter county, made while
the first writ was in the hands of the sheriff, is valid. Hardy v. Jasper,
14-158.
Indulgence of execntion, effect. —If the plaintiff indulges the execution,
and afterwards issues an alias, this indulgences does not affect the lien
of the first writ as to the defendant or his vendee. Arrington v. Sledge,
13-359; Palmer v. Clark, 13-354.
Same property cannot be re-sold. —Where there has been a sale under an
execution, the same property cannot be re-sold under a subsequent exe
cution issued on the same judgment. Peebles v. Pate, 86-437.
Judgment and execution a lien from first day of the term. —A judgment of
a court reaches back to the first day of a term, and an execution issued
thereon overreaches a conveyance made during the term, on a day prior
to the granting of the judgment. Finley v. Smith, 24-225; Farley v.

chaser under a decree to sell land for assets is not required to see that
the money arising therefrom is properly administered. Grimes v. Taft,
98-193.
Execution after a year and a day. — Execution issued upon a judgment
after a year and a day, without any scire facias, is irregular, and a sale
of laud under it is void. Perkins v. Bullinger, 2-422, (368),
Note. — It is now three years. See % 437 and 440, ante, and cases there
cited .
Alias executions. —The lien created by an execution is continued by an
alias regularly issuing thereon. Brassfield v. Whitaker, 1 1-309; Yarborough v. Bank, 13-23.
Where a series of executions issue on a judgment and have been bona
fide acted on, the last of them relates to the teste of the first and binds
the property of the defendant from that time. But where the original
or any of the intermediate writs were never delivered to the sheriff, the
lien is not carried back beyond the break. Spencer v. Hawkins, 39-288.
The priority of a levy under an undocketed judgment of the supreme
court is lost if the lien is not kept up by the issue of alias executions.

the teste, but from the time it was sued out. Williamson v. James,
32-162.
Resulting trust in a trust to secure creditors. —Where a deed of trust to
satisfy creditors is executed, a sale of the property under an execution
against the trustor passes nothing. Brown v. Graves, 11-342; Barham
v. Massey, 27-192.
The interest of the trustor, in a deed in trust for creditors, after the
payment of the debts secured by the deed can be sold under execution.

The resulting trust of an insolvent debtor in a deed in trust cannot be
sold under an execution, but must be reached by equitable proceeding
to subject it. McRary v. Fries, 57-233.
The docketing of a judgment is a lien upon ahe equitable estate of
the debtor in property conveyed by him to a trustee to secure certain

he has no such trust estate as can be sold under execution. Williams
v. Council, 49-206.
Fraudulent trusts. —Where the real purchaser of property has the title
fraudulently made to another, in secret trust for himself, his interest
cannot be sold under execution, but must be reached by equitable pro
ceedings. Morris v. Rippy, 49-533; Gowing v. Rich, 23-553.
The act authoring the sale of trust estates under execution only relates
to trusts which would be enforced between trustee and cestuis que trust,
and not to fraudulent trusts, in respect to which the court would not act
at instance of either party. Page v. Goodman, 43-16.
Where a son bought land with the money of his father, and took the
deed in his own name, but really for the use and benefit of his father,
and to defraud his father's creditors, such land is not liable to be sold
under an execution against the father. The creditor's remedy is in
equity. Jimmerson v. Duncan, 48-537; Gowing v. Rich, 23-553.

Worthaui v. Basket, 99-70.
Sale at improper time and place valid, when. —A sale under execution at
an improper place is valid if assented to by the defendant in the execu
tion. Biggs v. Brickell, 68-239.

made during the return term. Lanier v. Stone, 8-329; Mordeeai v.
Speight, 14-428.
Re-sale ordered, when.—It is a well settled rule of practice in this state,
that in judicial sales, the bidding will be opened and a re-sale ordered,
if before the sale is confirmed, an advance of ten per cent, is offered.
After confirmation the bidding will not be re-opened, except in case of
fraud or unfairness, or some other adequate cause. Trull v. Rice, 92572; Attorney Gen. v. Roanoke Nav. Co., 86-408; Miller v. Feezer,
82-192; Blue v. Blue, 79-69; Ashbee v. Cowell, 45-158; Harrison v. Bradlev, 40-136; In re Bost, 56-482; Wood v. Parker, 63-379; Dula v. Seagle,
98-458.

that said commissioner execute a deed to the purchaser, and further
directed him how to apply the proceeds of the sale, but contained no
provision for re-opening the biddings. After the sale an advance of ten

to be taxed as cost in the proceedings or action.
Note. —The former section (456) was stricken out, and the above sub
stituted by ch. 38, acts 1885.

Skinner v. Warren, 81-373.
Where the purchaser at execution sale is a stranger to the judgment,
he gets a good title, although the sheriff may have failed to advertise the
property and give notice to the judgment debtor, as prescribed by The
Code. All that such purchaser is required to ascertain is, that it is an
officer who sells, and that he is empowered to do so by an execution
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Burton v. Spiers, 92-503.
Sale without due advertisement valid, when.—In the absence of fraud, a
sale under execution without due advertisement does not vitiate the sale.
Wood!ey v. Gilliam, 67-237.
A purchaser at execution sale will acquire a good title, although there
may not have been due advertisement, if he had no notice of such irrcg
larity; but it would be otherwise if he had notice, or if the sale was made
at a place or time not warranted by law. Dula v. Seagle, 98-458.
Under former statutes. —Where, under the former statutes regulating
sales under execution, an execution based upon a judgment rendered by
a justice of the peace, was levied by a deputy sheriff upon land, was
returned to the proper court from which a venditioni exponas issued,
under which the deputy purchased, whose title was subsequently acquired
by an innocent purchaser, and it did not appear that the execution
debtor had notice of the levy and return thereof, but he did have notice
of the sale and purchase: Held, (1) that the purchase by the deputy was
not void; (2) that the failure to give notice of the levy and return was
but an irregularity, which did not affect the purchaser's title. Cowles v.
Hardin, 101-388.
Sec. 457. Notice of sale to be served on defendant, and in
certain cases on the governor. 1808-'9, c. 237, s. 11.

trary to the true intent and meaning of this sub-chapter
shall forfeit and pay two hundred dollars to any person
suing for the same, one-half for his own use and the other
half to the use of the county where the offence is com
mitted.

plaint alleged such sale was of realty, when the proof showed the prop
erty was personalty, the plaintiff can recover. Freeman v. Leonard,
99-274Sec. 402. No sale for want of bidders, what officer shall
state ; penalty. 11. C, c. 45, s. 19. 1815, c. 887, s. 1.

execution, that he has made no sale for want of bidders, he
shall state in his return the several places at which he has
advertised the sale of the property levied on, and the places
at which he hath offered the same for sale ; and any officer
failing to make such specification, shall, on motion, be sub
ject to a fine of forty dollars ; and every constable, for a
like omission of duty, shall be subject to a fine of ten dol
lars, for the use and benefit of the plaintiff in the execution ;
for which, on motion of the plaintiff, judgment shall be
granted by the court to which the execution shall be
returned ; or, in the case of a justice's execution, by any

execution or other process upon personal property, shall
permit the same to remain with the possessor, such officer
may take a bond for the forthcoming thereof to answer the
said execution or process, which bond shall be attested by
a credible witness ; but the officer shall, nevertheless, in
all respects, remain liable as heretofore to the plaintiff's
claim.
Form of bond. —An insensible condition in a bond renders it single; but
unmeaning words in the condition should be rejected so as to give the
obligor the benefit of it. Foster v. Frost, 15-424.
No form is prescribed for a forthcoming bond, and a condition that
the property shall be forthcoming, or be delivered at the time and place
of sale, is sufficient. It is not necessary to insert in such bond the names
of the plaintiffs at whose instance the execution issued. The obligors
in such bond are not discharged because the return day of the execution
levied is before the day named in the bond for the forthcoming of the
property. Grady v. Threadgill, 35-228.
Duty of obligors. —The obligation of a forthcoming bond is only that
the property shall be delivered to the officer at the time designated, and
not that the execution shall be satisfied. Gray v. Bowles, 18-437.
Where a forthcoming bond is given, it is the duty of the obligors to
put the officer in the quiet and peaceable possession of the property at
the time and place specified, otherwise their bond will be forfeited.
Poteet v. Bryson, 29-337. .

therein the property levied upon, and shall furnish to the
surety a list of the property in writing, under his hand,
attested by at least one credible witness, and stating therein
the day of sale ; and the property so levied upon shall be
deemed in the custody of the surety, as the bailee of the
officer ; and all other executions thereafter levied on said
property shall create a lien on the same from and after the
respective levies, and shall be satisfied accordingly out of
the proceeds of the sale of said property ; but the officer
thereafter levying shall not take the property out of the cus
tody of the surety : Provided, that in all such cases sales of
chattels shall take place within thirty days after the first
levy ; and, if sale shall not be made within the time afore
said, any other officer who may have levied upon the prop
erty may seize and sell the same
Sec. 405. Officer, how to proceed on bond, if condition
broken. Ji. C, c. 45, s. 23. 1822, c. 1141, s. 1.
• If the condition of such bond be broken, the sheriff or
other officer, on giving ten days' previous notice, in writ
ing, to any obligor therein, may on motion, have judgment
against him in a summary manner, before the superior
court, or before a justice of the peace, as the case may be,

or sheep, and all other property, the keeping of which may

cers out of the sales of the property, in preference to the
satisfaction of the process under which the property was
seized or sold.
Sec. 467. Officer to make out his account and file it with
execution. It. C, c. 45, s. 26. 1807, c. 731, s. 2.
Every such officer shall make out his account, and, if
required, shall give the debtor or his agent a copy thereof,
signed by his own hand, and shall return the account, with
the execution or other process under which the property
has been seized or sold, to the justice or the court to whom
the execution or process is returnable, and shall swear to
the correctness of the several items therein set forth ; other
wise he shall not be permitted to retain the same.

execution or decree by any officer authorized to make the
sale, and the sale is legally and in good faith made, and
such property be not the property of the person against
whose estate such execution or decree may have issued, by
reason of which the purchaser may have been deprived of
the same property, or may have been compelled to pay
damages in lieu thereof to the owner, in every such case
the purchaser, his executors or administrators, may sue the
person against whom such execution or decree may have
issued, or the person legally representing him, in a civil
action, and recover such sum as he may have paid for the

property sold is defective, the purchaser may recover of the defendant
in the execution. Brown v. Smith, 53-331; McDonald v. McLean, 60-120;
Wall v. Fairley, 77-105; Holliday v. McMillan, S3-270.
Contra, a purchaser at execution sale, who gets a defective title, has
no right to take the place of the creditor by substitution. Laws v.
Thompson, 49-104.
Purchaser subrogated to rights of execution creditor Where the purchaser
at an execution sale fails to 6btain a title by reason of the insufficiency
of the levy, he is substituted to the rights of the execution creditor, to
the extent that such creditor has been benefited by the sale. Pemberton v. McRae, 75-497.
Where plaintiff in the execution is the purchaser. —Where property not
belonging to the defendant in the execution is sold under such execu
tion and bought by the plaintiff at a price sufficient to pay the debt,
this is a satisfaction of the judgment, though the property is recovered
from the plaintiff in a suit by the owner, and though the judgment is
not marked satisfied. The plaintiff 's remedy is by Rev. Stat., ch. 45,

are made returnable, the clerk shall issue alias executions,
within 'six weeks thereafter, unless otherwise instructed as
aforesaid. And every clerk who shall fail to comply with
the requirements of this section, shall be liable to be
amerced in the sum cf one hundred dollars, for the benefit
of the party aggrieved, under the same rules that are pro
vided by law for amercing sheriffs, and shall be furtherliable to the party injured by suit upon his bond.
Duty of Clerk. —The clerk should endorse on the record the date of the
issue, and an endorsement made on the execution is not a compliance
with the statute. Bank v. Stafford, 47-68.
Semble, that a clerk will protect himself from amercement by issuing
the execution to his own county in the absence of special instructions
from the plaintiff. Bank v. Stafford, 47-68.
Deputy clerk can issue. —A deputy clerk has power to issue executions in
the name of the clerk, and may perform all the duties of the office,
except such as are judicial in their character, or where a statute specifi
cally provides otherwise. Miller v. Miller, 89-402.
Execution is issued, when. —The execution is not issued until the clerk
hands it to the sheriff, or to the party, or to his agent. State v. McLeod,
50-318.
Can issue pending supplementary proceedings. —An execution can issue on
a judgment pending supplementary proceedings which have been taken
out on the same judgment. Vegelahn v. Smith, 95-254.
Who may move to amerce. —The party seeking to enforce an amercement
under this section must show himself to be the party aggrieved by the
default. Simpson v. Simpson, 63-534.
Ordinance of June 23, 1866.—The ordinance of June 23, 1866, protected
the clerk from this penalty for failure to issue execution upon judg
ments where the debt was contracted prior to May 1, 1865. Badham v.
Jones, 64-655. But that ordinance is no protection where the cause of
action has accrued since May r, 1865. Williamson v. Kerr, 88-10.
Note. —The ordinance is now repealed.
Rule of court, June, 1869. —The rule of the supreme court, adopted at
June term, 1869 (Rule XIX, 63 N. C, 669), in so far as it attempted to
deprive a senior judgment creditor of his lien, interferes with a vested
right, and is unconstitutional. Burton v. Spiers, 92-503.
NoTe.—This rule has been rescinded.
Sec. 47 1. Officer to prepare tleed.t for proj>erti/ »old. if. C,
c. 45, s. 30. 1S4S, c. 39.
Sheriffs or other officers selling lands by authority of any
execution or process shall, upon payment of the price, pre
pare, execute and deliver to the purchaser a deed for the
property purchased: Provided, that the purchaser of land
shall furnish the officer with a description of the land.
Remedy to compel the sheriff to execute deed.—The proper remedy to com
pel a sheriff to execute a deed to the purchaser at execution sale is by a
motion in the cause— not by an independent action. Patrick v. Carr,
60-633; I'*ox v. Kline, 85-173.
Sheriff's deed relates back to the sale. —A sheriff's deed for land sold
under execution relates back to the sale. Hoke v. Henderson, 14-12.
Sheriff's deed conveys, —A sheriff's deed passes only such interest as the
execution debtor had at the time of the sale, and such debtor will not be
estopped thereby to assert a title subsequently acquired. Gentry v. Cal
lahan, 98-448.
Where purchaser participates in sheriff's dereliction. —Where the purchaser
is implicated in the sheriff's dereliction in failing to advertise according
to law, he cannot call for a conveyance. Skinner v. Warren, 81-373.
Effect of recitals in sheriff's deed. —Recitals in a sheriff's deed ate prima
facie evidence of an executiou sale, notwithstanding the return upon the
execution may be imperfect. The fact that there was a sale may also
be proved by parol. Parol testimony is admissible to show that the land
levied upon was sold as one tract, though described in the sheriff's deed
as two tracts. (The evidence in this case goes to show that the land
was designated and sold in one body.) The deed in such case, reciting,
in substance, the execution under which the land was sold, and purport
ing to convey title to the purchaser and his heirs, shows that the sheriff
exercised his power in the premises, and conveys the title of the defend
ant in the execution. Miller v. Miller, 89-402.
The recitals in a sheriff's deed are prima facie evidence as to his acts
recited therein. McKee v. Lineberger, 87-181; Hardin v. Cheek, 48-135;
Farrior v. Houston, 100-369; Wilson v. Taylor, 98-275.
Sheriff's rights if bid not paid. —A sheriff selling land under execution
may maintain an action in his own name against the purchaser for the
amount bid, upon tendering a deed for the land sold and before making
a return of the execution; or he may elect to rescind the sale and sell
the land again. McKee v. Lineberger, 69-217.
Sec. 472. Costs on execution satisfied in part or in whole to
be paid to clerk; penalty, forty dollars for failure. It. S.,
c. 76, 8. 5. 1822, c. 1149, s. 1.
The sheriff or other officer shall pay the costs on all exe
cutions which shall be satisfied in whole or in part, to the
clerk of the court from which the execution issued, and to
no other person, on the second day of the term of the court ;
and any such officer making default herein shall forfeit and
pay forty dollars for the benefit of the party aggrieved,
under the same rules that are provided by law for amercing
sheriffs.

value of land.
Sec. 473. Petition to be filed by claimant ; execution sus
pended; jury to assess damages and allowance. 1871-'2,
c. 14-7, s. 1.
Any defendant against whom a judgment shall be ren
dered for land, may, at any time before the execution of
such judgment, present a petition to the court rendering
the same, stating that he, or those under whom he claims,
while holding the premises under a color of title believed
by him or them to be good, have made permanent improve
ments thereon, and praying that he may be allowed for
the same, over and above the value of the use and occupa
tion of such land ; and thereupon the court may, if satis
fied of the probable truth of the allegation, suspend the
execution of such judgment and impanel a jury to assess
the damages of the plaintiff and the allowance to the defend
ant for such improvements : Provided, that in any such
action such inquiry and assessment may be made upon the
trial of the cause.
Act allowing "betterments" constitutional. —The act allowing the defend
ant for improvements made on land is constitutional. Barker v. Owen,
93-198.
"Betterments" cannot be allowed, when.—Where the husband of a feme
covert does not join in a conveyance of her land, and her privy examina
tion is not taken, the attempted conveyance is a nullity, and the vendee
having legal notice of the invalidity of his title cannot maintain a claim
for "betterments." Neither can one who acquires the estate of such
first purchaser under a mortgage sale, claim for betterments as such, but
he will be entitled to an equitable counterclaim to the demand of the
real owner for the rents and profits of the land. Scott v. Battle, 85-184.
Where a railroad enters upon the right-of-way without condemnation
proceedings, and erects buildings before the owners bring their action
for compensation, such owners cannot claim the value of the buildings
as "betterments." Gudger v. Railroad, 106-481.
Improvements made by purchaser without notice. —Where the title to the
land was in a feme covert who married in 1846, when under age, and
she and her husband executed a bond to convey the land after she
became of age to a party from whom the defendant derived title by
mesne conveyances, which bond was never registered, and the defendant
had no actual notice of any defect in his title, which he believed to be
good, the doctrine of constructive notice from registration does not
apply to such party, and he is entitled to compensation for permanent
improvements made by him on the laud. Justice v. Baxter, 93-405.
Improvements made by the life-tenant. —Improvements put upon land by
a life-tenant during his occupancy are not a charge upon it when it
passes to the remainderman, but the value of improvements made in
good faith after the estate has expired, is a counterclaim against the
claim for rents and profits. Merritt v. Scott, 81-3S5.
Improvements made by a tenant in common. —Where a tenant in common
has improved a part of the common laud, he is entitled, upon the parti
tion of the land, to have the part so improved allotted to him at its
value without improvements. Pope v. Whitehead, 68-191; Jones v.
Carland, 55-502; Collett v. Henderson, 80-337; Cox v. Ward, 107-507.
Improvements made by mortgagor. —Improvements put upon land by the
mortgagor cannot be claimed as betterments. They are a mere additional
security for the debt. Wharton v. Moore, 84-479.
Improvements made by purchaser of land by parol. —Where the purchaser's
title to land is invalid by reason of the contract of purchase having been
by parol, he is entitled to be refunded the purchase-money and the
value added to the land by his betterments before he can be ousted.
Daniel v. Grumpier, 75-184; Casey v. Cooper, 99-395.
Improvements under parol promise of settlement. —One who improves lands
under a parol promise that it shall be settled on him as an advancement
or gratuity will not be evicted until compensation made him for such
betterments. This remedy is not by virtue of this chapter, but inde
pendent of it. Hedgepeth v. Rose, 95-41.
This section does not apply to landlord and tenant. —The provisions of this
section do not apply where the relation of landlord and tenant is shown
to exist. Dunn v. Bagby, 88-91.
Applies to railroads.—The statutory remedy is available against an
incorporated railroad company which has recovered possession of lands
within its "right-of-way." Railroad v. McCaskill, 98-526.
If claim is set up in pleadings. —If claim for betterment is set up in the
pleadings it should be found as an issue on the trial. It cannot be raised
thereafter, as the judgment is conclusive as to all matters put in issue by
the pleadings. Casey v. Cooper, 99-395.
When claim not set up in pleadings. — Evidence of betterments placed
upon the land by the tenant was not competent when no issue in respect
thereto was made by the pleadings, tendered by the parties, or sub
mitted by the court. Morris v. O'Briant, 94-72.
Allowed defendant whether plaintiff's claim is equitable or legal. —A defend
ant is entitled to an allowance of the value of improvements put by him
on land, whether the plaintiff's claim be equitable or legal. Barker v.
Owen, 93-198.
Right to jury trial. —Either party is entitled to have the value of rents
and profits and betterments assessed by a jury instead of a referee,
unless waived. Fortescue v. Crawford, 10,5-29.
Petition can only be filed after judgment. —The benefit of this section can
only be had by a petition filed after judgment. Merritt v. Scott, 81-385;
Condry v. Cheshire, 88-375.
Note. —This was before the above proviso was added.
Burden on petitioner.— In a proceeding to ascertain the value of better
ments, the burden is upon the petitioner to show, not only that he
believed, but that he had good reason to believe, his title to the prem
ises was good, (at least until he made out a prima facie case, when the
burden shifted), and of the reasonableness of this belief the jury must be
the judge; and, it seems, the petitioner is competent to testify to his
belief in the validity of his title. Railroad v. McCaskill, 98-526.
Suspension of execution pending inquiry of "betterments."—Where, after a
recovery by the plaintiff, in ejectment, the defendant, in apt time, applied
to the court to have the value of the betterments allowed him, and the
court directed that execution be stayed till such value could be ascer
tained, upon the defendant giving bond, conditioned to pay all damages,
etc., which might be assessed against him, and the defendant failing to
give such bond, a writ of possession issued, and was executed: // was
held, { 1) that the failure to give the bond did not discontinue the action
in respect to the claim for betterments; (2) the court had no power to
refuse to institute an inquiry as to the defendant's right to betterments,
when application has been properly made; (3) the court has discretion
to direct the issuing or suspension of the execution of the judgment
pending such inquiry. Johnston v. Pate, 95-68.
Sec. 474. Jury to estimate the annual value of land.
187t-'i, c. 147,s. 2.
The jury, in assessing such damages, shall estimate
against the defendant the clear annual value of the premises
during the time he was in possession thereof, exclusive of
the use by the tenant of the improvements thereon made
by himself or those under whom he claims, and also the
damages for waste, or other injury to the premises, com
mitted by the defendant.
Defendant allowed improvements, chargeable with rents. — Where the defend
ant has been credited with the value of the " betterments " placed by
him on the land, he should be charged with the actual rent received by
him, though greatly enhanced by the improvements. Wetherell v. Gor
man, 74-603.
Rental valne, how shown.—Evidence of the annual rental value of land
for a preceding period is competent to show an average annual value.
Perry v. Jackson, 88-103.
Under The Code, ? 474, the proper inquiry for the jury on the ques
tion of damages is the annual value of the property, exclusive of the
improvement put on it by the defendant and those under whom he
claims. Barker v. Owen, 93-198.
Sec, 47ii. Defendant not liable for more than three pears,
unless he claims improvements. lS71-'2, c. 147, s. 3.
The defendant shall not be liable for such annual value
for any longer time than three years before the suit, or for
damages for any such waste or other injury done before
said three years, unless when he claims for improvements
as aforesaid.
Annual valne prior to three years before suit brought. —Those of the plain
tiffs who were not under disability were barred by the statute from recov
ering damages for waste permitted more than three years before the action
was brought, but damages might be estimated for the whole time from
the allotment of dower for the purpose of using the damage as set-off
against permanent improvements placed on the land by the life-tenant
during the same period. Sherrill v. Connor, 109-630.
Sec. 476. Value of defendant's improvements to be esti
mated. 1871-'2, c. 147, s. 4.
If the jury shall be satisfied that the defendant, or those
under whom he claims, made on the premises, at a time
when there was reason to believe the title good under which
he or they were holding the said premises, permanent and
valuable improvements, they shall estimate in his favor,
the value of such improvements as were so made before
notice, in writing of the title under which the plaintiff
claims, not exceeding the amount actually expended in
making them, and not exceeding the amount to which the
value of the premises is actually increased thereby at the
time of the assessment.
Value of improvements, how estimated. —In stating an account of rents
and profits of real estate, where the defendant is entitled to an allow
ance for "betterments," he should be credited with the enhanced value
of the property by reason of the repairs and improvements, and not the
costs thereof. Weatherell v. Gorman, 74-603; Hill v. Brower, 76-124.
The value of improvements is to be estimated, not by their cost, but
by the extent to which they have enhanced the value of the land. Smith
v. Stewart 83-406; White v. Jones, 88-166; Reed v. Exum, 84-430; Dan
iel v. Crumpler, 75-184; Railroad v. McCaskill 98-526.
The measdre of the value of betterments is not the actual cost of their
erection, but the enhanced value they may impart to the land, without
reference to the fact that they were not desired by the true owner, or
could profitably be used by him in the prosecution of his particular busi
ness. Railroad v. McCaskill, 98-526.
Sec. 477. 1mprovements to balance rents. 187 1-'2,c. 147,
s. 5.
If the sum estimated for the improvements exceed the
damages estimated by the jury against the defendant as
aforesaid, they shall then estimate against him for any time
before the said three years, the rents and profits accrued
against, or damages for waste or other injury done by him,
or those under whom he claims, so far as may be necessary
to balance his claim for improvements ; but in such case he
shall not be liable for the excess, if any, of such rents,
profits, or damages beyond the value of improvements.
Cancellation of deed made under duress. —Where a deed, executed under
duress, is cancelled,, the plaintiff is entitled to a restoration of the land
with compensation for its use, and such damages as it may have sus
tained. The defendant is entitled to a counterclaim' for the increased
value from the improvements (not the cost of the improvements) put
upon the land by him, and for the purchase-money. Reed v. Exum,
84-430.
Voluntary rescission of contract for sale of land. —Upon the voluntary
rescission of a contract of sale of land, the vendee in possession is enti
tled to a return of the purchase-money, and the vendor to a fair rent
for the premises, deducting the added value given to the land by the
betterments placed thereon by the vendee. Smith v. Stewart, 83-406.
Purchaser of land from feme covert. —Where, however, the husband of a
Jeme covert does not join in a conveyance of her land, and her privy
examination is not taken it is a nullity, and the purchaser is not entitled
to claim for "betterments" as such, nor would one who bought at a
sale foreclosing a mortgage executed on the land by such purchaser be
in a better position. But the latter would be entitled to a fair allowance
as an equitable counterclaim for the added value given to the property
by such betterments against the demand of the real owner for rents and
profits. Scott v. Battle, 85-184.
Where defendant is credited with repairs.—When a defendant is credited
with such repairs, he should be charged with the actual rent received
after they were made, though it was greatly enhanced by such improve
ments. Wetherell v. Gorman, 74-603.
Rents and profits prior to three years. —Although the statute bars a recov
ery of rents and profits which have accrued more than three years before
the bringing of the action, yet, if the defendant sets up a claim for bet
terments, the bar is removed and such rents and profits are available
against the valuation for improvements, so far as is necessary to extin
guish such claim. Barker v. Owen, 93-198; Sherrill v. Connor, 107-630.
Sec. 478, Jury to find a verdict for the balance for plain
tiff or defendant. 1871-'2, c. 147, s. 6.
After offsetting the damages assessed for the plaintiff,
and the allowances to the defendant for the improvements,
if any, the jury shall find a verdict for the balance for the
plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, and the judg
ment shall be entered therefor according to the verdict.
Sec. 479. Balance due defendant to constitute alien until
paid. 1871-"2, 1.. 147, s. 7.
Any such balance due to the defendant shall constitute
a Hen upon the land recovered by the plaintiff until the
same shall be paid.
Right-of-way. — Quare, whether the right-of-way of a railroad could tie
sold under such lien. Railroad v. McCaskill, 98-526.
Sec. 480. Plaintiff claiming a less estate, and paying
defendant allowance, may recover out of remainderman.
J 871-'*, c 147, s. 8.
If the plaintiff claim only an estate for life in the land
recovered, and pay any sum allowed to the defendant for
improvements, he or his personal representative may recover
at the determination of his estate from the remainderman
or reversioner the value of the said improvements as they
then exist, not exceeding the amount as paid by him, and
shall have a lien therefor on the premises, in like manner
as if they had been mortgaged for the payment thereof,
and may keep possession of said premises until it be paid.
Sec. 481. Does not apply to action brought by mortgagee.
1 S71-'2, c. 147, s. ».
Nothing herein shall extend or apply to any suit brought
by a mortgagee or his heirs or assigns against a mortgagor
or his heirs or assigns for the recovery of the mortgaged
premises.
Improvement by mortgagor. —Improvements put upon land by a mort
gagor become additional security for the debt, and do not entitle him,
or any one claiming under him, to any part of the proceeds of a fore
closure sale unless there is a surplus after satisfying the debt. Wharton
v. Moore, 84-479.
Sec. 482. Defendant claiming allowance, plaintiff may
have his estate rained without improvement. 187 1-'2, c.
147, s. 10.
When the defendant shall claim allowance for improve-,
ments, the plaintiff may, by entry on the record, require
that the value of his estate in the premises without the
improvements shall also be ascertained.
Sec.48!t. Value of premises, how marie. 187 l-'2, c. 147,
11.
The value of the premises in such cases shall be esti
mated as it would have been at the time of the inquiry, if
no such improvements had been made on the premises by
the tenant, or any person under whom he claims, and shall
be ascertained in the manner hereinbefore provided for esti
mating the value of improvements.
Sec. 484. Plaintiff mat/ elect to let defendant take premises
at valuation. 1871-'2, c. 147, s. 12.
The plaintiff in such case, if judgment is rendered for
him, may, at any time during the same term, or before
judgment is rendered on the assessment of the value of the
improvements, in person or by his attorney in the cause,
enter on the record his election to relinquish his estate in
the premises to the defendant, at the value as ascertained,
and the defendant shall thenceforth hold all the estate that
the plaintiff had therein at the commencement of the suit:
Provided, he pay therefor the said value with interest in
the manner in which the court may order it to be paid.
Plaintiff may relinquish. —The plaintiff has the right to relinquish his
estate in the laud, upon payment to him by the defendant of its value
unimproved. Barker v. Owen, 93-198.
If plaintiff takes the land. —If the plaintiff does not exercise his election,
but takes the laud, the sum adjudged to the defendant for the improve
ments is a lien 011 the land, and, if not paid, an order may be made to
sell the land for its payment. Ibid.
Sec. 485. Payments to be made in court : land bound; if
payments not made, land sold. 1871-'2, c. 157, «. IS.
The payments shall be made to the plaintiff, or into
court for his use, and the land shall be bound therefor, and
if the defendant fail to make the said payments within or
at the times limited therefor respectively, the court may
order the land to be sold and the proceeds applied to the
payment of said value and interest, and the surplus, if any,
to be paid to the defendant; but if the said net proceeds be
insufficient to satisfy the said value and interest, the defend
ant shall not be bound for the deficiency.
Sec. 480. When the plaintiff is a feme covert, minor or
insane, what to be done with proceeds. 1871-'2, c. 147,
s. 14.
If the party by or for whom the land is claimed in the
suit be a feme covert, minor or insane, such value shall be
deemed to be real estate, and be disposed of as the court
may consider proper for the benefit of the persons interested
therein.
Sec. 487. When defendant evicted by force of a better
title, he or his representatives may recover from plaintiff.
1871-'2,c.-147, s. 15.
If the defendant, his heirs or assigns shall, after the
premises are so relinquished to him, be evicted thereof by
force of any better title than that of the original plaintiff,
the person so evicted may recover from such plaintiff or his
representatives the amount so paid for the premises as so
much money had and received by such plaintiff in his life
time for the use of such person, with lawful interest thereon
from the time of such payment.
Sec. 488. Execution, returned unsatisfied, order to answer
concerning his property. C. C. P., s. '404. J868-'9, c.
05, «. 2.
(1) When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or any one of several debtors in the same judgment,
issued to the sheriff of the county where he resides or has
a place of business, or if he do not reside in the state, to
the sheriff of the county where a judgment-roll or tran
script of a justice's judgment is filed is returned unsatisfied,
in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time
after such return made, and within three years from the
time of issuing the execution, is entitled to an order from
the court to which the execution is returned, or from the
judge thereof, requiring such debtor to appear and answer
concerning his property, before such court or judge, at a
time and place specified in the order, within the county to
which the execution was issued.
Requisites before the order should issue.—To authorize the grant of an
order of examination under supplemental proceedings, there should be
made to appear by affidavit or otherwise : 1,1) The want of known prop
erty liable to execution, which is proved by the sheriff's return of unsat
isfied ; (2) the non-existence of an equitable estate in land within the
lien of the judgment ; (3) the existence of property, choses in action
and things of value, unaffected by any lien and incapable of levy. Hins
dale v. Sinclair, 83-338; Magruder v. Shelton, 98-545.
Note. —These decisions are modified by the amendment to subsec
tion 2. See following case:
While the statute, in its present form, dispenses with the necessity
that an affidavit to obtain -proceedings supplemental to execution shall
allege that the judgment debtor'has no "equitable estate in land subject
to the lien of the judgment, and that he has choses in action or other
things of value unaffected by the lieu of the judgment and incapable of
levy," it is still essential that it shall allege the want of known prop
erty liable to execution. Hackney v. Arrington, 99-110.
No demand necessary. —Xo previous demand on debtor is required. Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65.
Notice not necessary. — Eight days' notice to debtor not necessary. Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65.
Purpose of this section. —The purpose of The Code was to give proceed
ings supplementary to execution only in case the debtor has no prop
erty liable to execution or to what is in the nature of execution, to-wit,
proceedings to enforce a sale. Hutchison v. Symons, 67-136; McKeithan
v. Walker, 66-95; Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65; Hinsdale v. Sinclair,
83-338.
In nature of equitable execution. — Proceedings supplemental to the exe
cution are chiefly equitable in their nature, and are in the nature of an
equitable execution. Vegelahn v. Smith, 95-254; Coates v. Wilkes,
94-174.
Affidavit.—An affidavit is insufficient to warrant the examination of the
judgment debtor, if it does not negative property in the defendant liable
to execution and the existence of equitable interests which may be sub
jected by sale in the nature of execution, but the omission of such negative averments may be remedied by amendment at the hearing. WeilIer v. Lawrence, 81-65. The latter averment now not required. Hack
ney v. Arrington, 99-110.
If affidavit is defective it can be amended at the trial. Weiller v. Law
rence, 81-65; Hasty v. Simpson, 77-69.
The affidavit required by this section is sufficiently verified if made
before a commissioner of this state, resident in another state, and authen
ticated by his official signature and seal. Young v. Rollins, 85-485.
Execution returned before the return diy, whan.—A sheriff may return an
execution before the return term thereof, if it be satisfied, or if there
can be no property found out of which to satisfy the same. Whitehead
v. Hellen, 74-679.
Alias execution. —The fact that the sheriff has an alias execution in
his hands unreturned, which was issued on the same judgment on which
supplementary proceedings have been taken, is no bar to such proceed
ings, and no grounds on which they can be dismissed. Vegelahn v.
Smith, 95-254Judgment not impeachable collaterally.—A judgment, whether just or
unjust, consbionable or unconscionable, if regularly taken in a court of
competent jurisdiction, may be enforced by execution or proceedings
supplementary thereto, and the judgment cannot be attacked by any
member of the defendant corporation, or its creditors, except for fraud
or collusion. Heggie v. B. and L. Association, 107-581.
Judgment barred. —Where, after such proceedings had been instituted,
the judgment became barred by the lapse of time, this did not operate
to bar the proceedings. Coates v. Wilkes, 94-174.
Judgment paid. —See Righton v. Pruden, infra.
Injunctions and receivers. —Supplemental proceedings are substituted in
the present system of procedure for the method of granting relief in
equity in the former system in favor of a judgment creditor after the
remedy at law by execution had been exhausted. They are incidental
to the original action, and, to accomplish their purpose of reaching the
judgment debtor's property of every kind that cannot, for any cause, be
reached by execution, injunctions may be granted and receivers appointed
in them as occasion may require. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
Estoppel. —Where, in supplementary proceedings, the judgment credit
ors of R. sought to subject the amount recovered by R.'s receiver in
suits against certain insurance companies on account of loss, by fire, of
some tobacco, which loss was payable to one M. : Held, that where suits
were brought to determine the liabilities of the insurance companies
solely, and the other questions were left to be determined by these pro
ceedings, the finding of the court in those suits that R. was the sole
owner of the tobacco was not an estoppel upon M., who was resisting
the claims of the judgment creditors. Fertilizer Co. v. Reams, 105-283.
See, also, Rice v. Jones, 103-226.
From what county to issue. —-Where a judgment was rendered in one
county and docketed in another, proceedings supplementary to execu
tion should be instituted in the county in which the judgment was ren
dered, as the action is pending in that county until the judgment is
satisfied. Hutchinson v. Symons, 67-156.
«
Where defendant is to be examined. —Supplemental proceedings should be
instituted in the county where the judgment was rendered, but the place designated for the defendant to appear and answer must be in the county
where the defendant resides. Hasty v. Simpson, 77-69.
Joint debtors. —Joint debtors can be examined under this section.
Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65.
The provisions of 488 and 490 apply to cases in which there may be
either one or several judgment debtors, but fj 489 only applies in cases
where there is but one judgment debtor. In other words, if the judg
ment be against A, and D is his debtor, he may discharge his debt by
paying over to the sheriff; but, if the judgment be against A, B and C,
jointly and severally liable, and D owes them all, he cannot discharge
himself by paying over to the sheriff. Howey v. Miller, 67-459.
Note.-—Section 489 is now changed in this respect.
Distinction between application for order before and after return of execution. —
Under S3 488 and 490, there is a distinction made in the requirements for
proceedings supplementary to execution, where the execution is returned
unsatisfied, and where the execution is issued, but before its return. In
the former case, an affidavit that the execution has been returned unsat
isfied, and that the defendant has property or choses in action which
ought to be subjected, is sufficient to warrant the proceedings. In the
latter, the affidavit should show that the debtor has no property which
can be reached by execution, and that he has property or choses in
action which he unjustly refuses to apply to the satisfaction of the judg
ment. Hutchinson v. Symons, 67-156.
Proceedings instituted before sale of property levied upon. —Supplemental
proceedings may be commenced before the sale of the property levied
upon, on affidavit or other proof of its insufficient value; but no final
order can be made appropriating to the creditor any property discovered
until the property previously levied on has been exhausted. McKeithan
v. Walker, 66-95.
Death of judgment debtor before appointment of receiver. —In supplementary
proceedings, if the judgment debtor die before the appointment of a
receiver is filed in the clerk's office, no lien is acquired by the receiver
or creditor as against the administrator of a judgment debtor. Rankin
v. Minor, 72-424.
Death of a non-resident debtor. —Upon the death of a non-resident intes
tate, leaving assets in this state, they are to be applied to the payment
of the claims of his resident creditors, if there be any such, in the order
prescribed by our law, and not by that of his domicile. Such assets are
to be collected by an administrator appointed here, and not by the cred
itors. The "supplemental proceedings" do not apply to such a case,
but are intended to supply the place of the former proceedings in equity,
where relief was given after a creditor had recovered a judgment at law
and was unable to obtain a satisfaction under further legal process.
Where one who is charged in supplemental proceedings as holding
property belonging to a judgment debtor claims such property as his
own, the question cannot be decided in the course of such proceedings,
but must be settled by an action. Carson v. Oates, 64-115.
Priority of creditor first moving. —The judgment creditor who first insti
tutes supplemental proceedings is entitled to priority of lien thereunder,
unless he lose such right by a failure to pursue his remedy with dili
gence. Parks v. Sprinkle, 64-637.
Irregular process no justification.—Irregular process, after it has been
set aside, is no justification to the plaintiff in the action or bis attorneys
and aiders. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189.
Does not apply. —This section does not apply where there are several
debtors in the same judgment. Howe v. Miller, 67-459.
Note.—This section, as now amended, changes this,
See cases cited under preceding section.
Sec. 400. Execution issued and returned, upon affidavit,
order to issue to any person having property ofjudgment
debtor, or to any person indebted to him over ten dollars,
to appear and answer; proceedings against joint debtors.
C. C. P., s. 266. 1860-'70, c. 70, s. 2
After the issuing or return of an execution against prop
erty of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debt
ors in the same judgment, and upon affidavit that any per
son or corporation has property of said judgment debtor, or
is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, the
court or judge may, by an order, require such person or
corporation, or any officer or member thereof, to appear at
a specified time and place and answer concerning the same.
The court or judge may also, in its or his discretion, require
notice of such proceeding to be given to any party to the
action, in such manner as may seem to him or it proper.
The proceedings mentioned in this section and in section
four hundred and eighty-eight may be taken upon the
return of an execution unsatisfied, issued upon a judgment
recovered in an action against joint debtors, in which some
of the defendants have not been served with the summons
by which said action was commenced, so far as relates to
the joint property of such debtors ; and all actions by cred
itors to obtain satisfaction of judgments out of the property
of joint debtors are maintainable in the like manner and to
the like effect. These provisions shall apply to all proceed
ings and actions and to those terminated by final decree or
judgment.
See cases cited under { 488, ante.
Against whom it issues. —A married woman, who received a bond given
for part of the purchase-money of her husband's land, as in lieu of pos
sible dower therein, may be compelled to surrender it for the use of a
creditor proceeding under this chapter. Sutton v. Askew, 66-172.
The superior courts have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action
instituted by a creditor of a lunatic, for the recovery of a debt contracted
prior to the lunacy. In such case, where the judge, in the court below,
dismissed proceedings supplementary to execution: Held, to be error.
Blake v. Respass, 77-193.
Supplemental proceedings lie against a private corporation chartered
by the legislature and organized for the private gain of its stockholders.
La Fontaine v. Southern Underwriters, 79-511.
Agreement to deliver specific articles at a price named, how subjected. —
Where it appears from an examination under supplemental proceedings
that the judgment debtor holds a claim against a third party, to be dis
charged by the delivery of corn at a stipulated price per bushel, the
court cannot order such person to deliver to the creditor a sufficient
quantity of the corn, at the agreed price, to satisfy the debt. The proper
order is to sell the corn and apply the proceeds to the debt. In re
Davis, 81-72.
Where judgment is paid before the receiver files his bond. —If after supple
mental proceedings instituted and proceedings aud a receiver appointed,
but before he filed his .bond the defendant paid off the judgment to the
plaintiff, the court cannot thereafter allow the pleadings to be amended
so as to make other creditors plaintiffs and continue the proceedings in
their behalf. Righton v. Pruden, 73-61.
No lien on debtor's services. —While creditors may subject, in a supple
mental proceeding, the debtor's choses in action, including even a claim
for compensation due for service rendered under an express or implied
contract, they have no lien on his skill or attainments, and cannot com
pel him to exact compensation for managing his wife's property, or for
service rendered to any person with the understanding that it was gra
tuitous. Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
Sec. 401. Witness required to testify as on trial of an issue.
C. C. P., s. 2<>7.
Witnesses may be required to appear and testify on any
proceedings under this chapter, in the same manner as upon
the trial of an issue.
Sec. 402. Party or witness to appear before referee, and
compelled to answer under oath ; examination certified to
court or Judge ; corporation to answer by an officer. C. C.
P., s. 268. JS71-"2, c. 245, s. 1.
The party or witness may be required to attend before
the court or judge, or before a referee appointed by the
court or judge; if before a referee, the examination shall
be taken by the referee, and certified to the court, or judge.
All examinations and answers before a court or judge or
referee, under this chapter, shall be on oath, except that
when a corporation answers, the answer shall be on the
oath of an officer thereof.
Wliere proceedings are instituted.— Supplemental proceedings must be
instituted in the county where the judgment was rendered. Hutchinson
v. Symons, 67-156.
Where defendant must be examined. — Supplemental proceedings should
be instituted in the county where the judgment was rendered, but the
place designated where the defendant shall appear and answer should
be within the county where the defendant resides. Hasty v. Simpson,
77-69.
Parties and witnesses must appear before the referee. —This section requires
the parties and witnesses to appear before the referee appointed by the
court. Hasty v. Simpson, 77-69.
Evidence in writing. — In supplemental proceedings the evidence should
all be taken down in writing. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
Contempt before referee, bow punished.—A contempt in refusing to answer
questions under this section can only be punished by the court appoint
ing the referee, and not by the referee himself. La Fontaine v. Under
writers, 83-132.
Res inter alios acta. —An order in supplemental proceedings does not
bind one not a party. Rice v. Jones, 103-226; Fertilizer Co. v. Reams,
105-283.
Sec. 493. Property of debtor not exempt from execution to
be applied to payment of judgment ; exception. C. C. P.,
8. 209. 1870-'l, c. 245, s. 1.
The court or judge may order any property, whether sub
ject or not to be sold under execution (except the home
stead and personal property exemptions of the judgment
debtor), in the hands either of himself or of any other per
son, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards
the satisfaction of the judgment; except that the earnings
of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within
sixty days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied
when it is made to appear, by the debtor's affidavit or
otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of
a family supported wholly or in part by his labor.
A substitute for creditor's bill. —Supplemental proceedings are a substi
tute for the former creditor's bill and are governed by the principles
established under the former practice in administering this species of
relief in behalf of judgment creditors. Rand v. Rand, 78-12.
But the creditor's bill can still be resorted to. Bronson v. InsuranceCo., 85-411.
Action for distributive share. —A judgment creditor, whose execution
has been returned unsatisfied, cannot maintain an action against an
administrator to subject a distributive share of the judgment debtor in
the estate; he must proceed by supplemental proceedings. Rand v.
Rand, 78-12.
Application of proceeds of execution to pay costs. —Where judgment for
costs issues against an insolvent plaintiff, the court can order them paid
out of money in the hands of the sheriff, collected on an execution in
favor of the insolvent* Clerk's Office v. Allen, 52-156; Clerk's Office v.
Bank, 66-214.
NOTE. —Doubtless, however, the insolvent would now be first allowed
his personal property exemption, if claimed by him.
Sec. 494. Judge to appoint receiver; transfer of property
forbidden; other creditors having instituted supplemen
tary proceedings to he notified; no more than one receiver
appointed. C. C. P., s. 270. 1870->1, c. 24~t, s. 1.
187<i-'7,c. 223. 1870, c.G.i. 1881, c. 51.
The court or judge having jurisdiction over the appoint
ment of receivers may also, by order, in like manner and
with like authority, appoint a receiver in proceedings under
this chapter, of the property of the judgment debtor,
whether subject or not to be sold under execution, except
the homestead and personal property exemptions. But
before the appointment of such receiver, the court or judge
shall ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of the party
or otherwise, whether any other supplementary proceed
ings are pending against the judgment debtor, and if such
proceedings are so pending the plaintiff therein shall have
notice to appear before him, and shall likewise have notice
of all subsequent proceedings in relation to said receiver
ship. No more than one receiver of the property of a
judgment debtor shall be appointed. The court or judge
may also forbid a transfer or other disposition of the prop
erty of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, as
homestead or personal property exemptions, and any inter
ference therewith. The title of the receiver shall relate
back to the service of the restraining order hereinbefore and
hereinafter provided for.
Priority among receivers depends upon date of application and not of appoint
ment. —In a race of diligence between creditors under such proceedings,
if the personal property sought to be subjected be such as may be
levied on and seized, priority is to be tested by precedence in the
appointment of the receiver; in case a receiver was applied for earlier
by one, but another received an earlier appointment, it seems that pri
ority will be determined by the date of application. Parks v. Sprinkle,
64-637-
Consolidation. —Where an action in the nature of a judgment creditor's
bill is pending, it is error to dismiss proceedings supplementary to exe
cution instituted in behalf of another creditor against the same debtor.
Where several of such proceedings are pending, and the same prop
erty is sought to be subjected, or where, in either of such proceedings, a
receiver is appointed of property which is the subject of the other pro
ceeding, the court should, in proper cases, order that the same be con
solidated, preserving the priorities acquired by the superior diligence of
the various litigants. Monroe v. Lewald, 107-655.
Receiver, by whom appointed.—The receiver under supplemental pro
ceedings under this section must be appointed by the judge, and not by
the clerk. Parks v. Sprinkle, 64-637.
A receiver may be appointed by the judge residing in the district, or
by the judge holding the courts of the district either by assignment or
exchange. Corbin v. Berry, 83-27.
Note. —When this decision was rendered the words "court or" were
not then in this section. Quare, whether now the clerk acting as and
for the court can appoint receivers in supplementary proceedings. // is
held (Bank v. Burns, 107-465), that the clerk can make the order to
" appear and answer " under $ 488 (1),
Receiver appointed, when. —In proceedings supplemental to execution, a
receiver will not be appointed except where it is made to appear that
one is necessary to the preservation of the property sought to be sub
jected, and its application to the payment of the judgment, if such pay
ment shall be directed. Rodman v. Harvey, 102-1; Coates v. Wilkes,
92-37°.
Effect of appointment.—The general principles of law applicable to
receivers apply to those appointed in supplemental proceedings. It is
the duty of such receiver to take possession of the property of the debtor
at once, and to bring actions to recover any property belonging to him
which may be in the hands of third persons. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
Where a receiver is appointed in a proceeding supplemental to execu
tion, he becomes the legal assignee of the property specified in the order,
subject to the discretion of the court in which the judgment was ren
dered, and the judgment debtor is forbidden to interfere in any manner
with its collection or control. Turner v. Holden, 94-70.
The legal effect of granting a restraining order, or the appointment of
a receiver in proceedings supplemental to execution, is to vest the
receiver with the property and effects of the judgment debtor from the
time of the filing of the orders, and disables the debtors from transfer
ring the title thereto. Rose v. Baker, 99-323.
Injunction. — Where, in proceedings supplementary to execution, it is
alleged that a third person has property of the judgment debtor's, it is
error to restrain such third person from disposing of such property until
the receiver can bring an action for its recovery, unless such person has
been made a party, in some way, to the proceeding. Coates v. Wilkes,
94-174.
Prior proceedings pending, effect. —While the judge should first ascertain
whether there are other supplementary proceedings pending, his failure
to do so does not necessarily require the reversal of his order appointing
a receiver. Corbin v. Berry, 83-27.
Sec. 4U5. Clerk of superior court to file order, record it,
provide receiver with a copy ; receiver to be vested with
property ; receiver subject to control of judge. C. C. P.,
s. 270. 187()-'1, c. 245, s. 1.
Whenever the court or a judge shall grant an order for
the appointment of a receiver of the property of the judg
ment debtor, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk
of the superior court of the county where the judgment-roll
in the action, or transcript from justice's judgment upon
which the proceedings are taken, is filed; and the clerk
shall record the order in a book to be kept for that purpose
in his office, to be called "book of orders appointing
receivers of judgment debtors," and shall note the time of
the filing of said order therein. A certified copy of said
order shall be delivered to the receiver named therein, and
he shall be vested with the property and effects of the judg
ment debtor from the time of the service of the restraining
order, if such restraining order shall have been made, and
if not, from the time of the filing and recording of the
order for the appointment of a receiver. The receiver of
the judgment debtor shall be subject to the direction and
control of the court in which the judgment was obtained
upon which the proceedings are founded.
Death of judgment debtor. — In proceedings supplementary to execution,
if the judgment debtor dies before the appointment of a receiver, or
before the order of such appointment is filed in the office of the clerk
of the superior court, the property and effects of such judgment debtor
do not vest in the receiver, nor
thereon as against the administrator of the judgment debtor. Rankin
v. Minor, 72-424.
Payment of judgment.— If the debt due the plaintiff is paid off before the
receiver files his bond, the proceedings cannot be amended so as to let
other creditors come in and continue the proceedings. Righton v. Pruden, 73-61.
Jurisdiction of clerk. —The clerk has no jurisdiction to appoint a receiver.
Parks v. Sprinkle, 64-637.
Note. —This decision was made before the amendment which added
the words " court or " to this section. Quare, whether the clerk can now
appoint receivers in supplementary proceedings.
Pending appeal. — The motion for such receiver may be made before the
judge, pending an appeal to him from the ruling of the clerk upon other
questions. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
See \ 379, ante, and cases there cited.
Sec. 496. Order to be. filed in the. office of what clerk, before
rested with real property. C. C. P., f. 270.
But before the receiver shall be vested with any real
property of such judgment debtor, a certified copy of said
order shall also be filed and recorded on the execution
docket, in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the>
county in which any real estate of such judgment debtor
sought to be affected by such order is situated, and also in
the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in
which such judgment debtor resides.
Sec. 4U7. Property claimed by a third party, or debt denied,
receiver to briny action , and in meantime transfer or pay
ment forbidden. C. C. P., 8. 271. 1870-'1, c. 245, s. 1.
If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims
an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the
debt, such interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an
action against such person or corporation by the receiver ;
but the court or judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or
other disposition of such property or interest, till a sufficient
opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the
action, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution,
but such order may be modified or dissolved by the court
or judge having jurisdiction, at any time, on such security
as he shall direct.
Receiver to bring action. —The receiver is authorized to bring such action
without necessity of special leave of court to sue. Weill v. Bank, 106-1 ;
Wilson v. Chichester, 107-386.
Interpleader. —Proceedings supplemental to execution are in the nature
of a creditor's bill, and it being the policy of the law to settle the entire
controversy in one action, it is not error to permit a third party to inter
plead and assert title to the property which is sought to be subjected.
Munds v. Cassidy, 98-55B.
In supplementary proceedings it was adjudged that the fund in ques
tion belonged to the judgment debtor, and an order made that the fund be paid into court. Afterwards, upon claim made by another, the cleric
refused to pay the money to him, and appointed a receiver, who brought
action against the judgment debtor to try the question of title to the
fund: Held, (i) that the action was improperly brought; (2) that defend
ants, claimants to the fund, should have been allowed to interplead in
the supplementary proceedings; (3) that the action by the receiver was
improperly brought, and should be dismissed, but without prejudice to
any of the parties. Wilson v. Chichester, 107-386.
Property of wife.—Where husband and wife, in 1869, contracted to sell
the land devised to the wife in 1855, and jointly covenanted to make the
title when the purchase-money was paid, the purchaser giving bonds
payable to the husband alone for the purchase-money, it was error in
the court below, to condemn this debt, owing by the purchaser of the
lands, to the payment of a debt due from the husband: Held further,
that the wife was entitled to be heard, on motion, in the proceedings
supplemental to execution, instituted to subject the debt, owing for the
land, to the payment of the debt owing by the husband. Williams v.
Green, 68-183.
Sec. 498. Judge may order a reference, to report tlie evi
dence or facts. C. C. P., ft. 272.
The court or judge may, in his discretion, order a refer
ence to a referee agreed upon by the parties, or appointed
by him, to report the evidence or the facts, and may, in his
discretion, appoint such referee in the first order, or at any
time.
Reference to take testimony. —This section authorizes the judge to appoint
a referee to report the evidence or facts, and is especially useful where
the judgmeut debtor resides in a county other than that in which the
judgment was taken. Hasty v. Simpson, 77-69.
Sec. 499. Costs to be allowed. C. C. P., s. 273.
The court or judge may allow to the judgment creditor,
or to any party so examined, whether a party to the action
or not, witnesses' fees and disbursements.
Sec. SOO. Disobedience to order : jHtnishment. C. C. P., s.
274. 1809->70, c. 79, s. 3.
If any person, party or witness, disobey an order of the
court or judge or referee, duly served, such person, party
or witness may be punished by the judge as for a contempt.
And in all cases of commitment under this sub-chapter,
the person committed may, in case of inability to perform
the act required, or to endure the imprisonment, be dis
charged from imprisonment by the judge committing him,
or the judge having jurisdiction, on such terms as may be
just.
Instance* of contempt.—Where two parties obtained a judgment against
a defendant, and had their judgments docketed in another county, and
one obtained a receiver to be appointed by the judge of the district, and
the other obtained an order for a debtor of the defendant to appear and
answer as to his indebtedness, and the debtor did appear and acknowl
edge his liability and paid the money into the hands of the clerk, and
on the same day the clerk had verbal notice of the order appointing the
receiver, and after such notice paid the money over to the other plain
tiff, this was a contempt of the order appointing a receiver. Parks v.
Sprinkle, 64-637.
If, in the case of proceedings supplemental to execution an order be
made appointing a receiver, and directing a certain person to deliver a
bond, alleged to belong to the execution debtor, to the receiver, he is
primafacie guilty of a contempt of court, if he hand it to an attorney
for collection, instead of delivering it to a receiver, though he may be
discharged upon swearing that he only intended for a certain purpose to
get a judgment, and not to collect the money, and that thereby he had
not intended any contempt of the court; but his discharge should be
granted on his paying the costs. Bond v. Bond, 69-97; In re Daves,
81-72.
Contempt before referee. —When in the coutse of proceedings supple
mentary to execution a witness is examined before a referee under $ 492,
no trial can be said to take place before the referee, and a contempt in
refusing to answer question's on such examination must be punished by
the court making the reference. La Fontaine v. Southern Underwriters,
Sec. 501. Exemptions from safe under execution in force
at the time the debt was contracted, or cause of action
arose, are to be set apart. 1870, c. 230, «. 1.
There shall be exempt from sale under execution or
other final process issued for the collection of any debt
upon all judgments heretofore, or which may be hereafter
rendered, such property as the judgment debtor may have
been entitled to have set apart and allotted to him at the
time the debt was contracted, or cause of action accrued,
as follows:
Allotted according to law in force when debt was contracted.—The home
stead and personal property exemption shall be allotted according to
the law in force at time the debt was contracted. Earl v. Hardic, 80177; Carlton v. Watts, 82-212; Dail v. Sugg, 85-104.
A homestead will not be allowed against a judgment founded upon a
contract made prior to the adoption of the constitution of 186S. Miller
v. Miller, 80-402; Gheen v. Suinmey, 80-187.
The debtor is entitled to his homestead where judgment is rendered
011 a note given since the adoption of the homestead, but for an indebt
edness contracted prior to such adoption, and it seems he is also enti
tled to the homestead when the judgment on an account some of the
items of which were contracted prior and others subsequent to the pas
sage of the homestead law. Arnold v. Iistis, 92-162.
Exemptions necessarily void as to prior debts. —The homestead and per
sonal property exemption is not necessarily void as to old debts, but
only so in case tljey should defeat their collection in whole or in part.
Albright v. Albright, 88-238; Morrison v. Watson, 101-332.
Overruled.—Long v. Walker, 105-90.
In what cases homestead not exempt. —A homestead is exempt from sale
under execution, except (1) for taxes; (2) for obligations contracted for
the purchase of the premises; (3) for mechanic's aud laborer's lien; (4)
for debts contracted prior to the adoption of the constitution. Mebane
v. Lay ton, 89-396.
There is a presumption in favor of such exemption, and a creditor who
seeks to subject the homestead to the payment of a debt must bring
himself within one of these exceptions by proper averment and proof.
Ibid.
Date of debt. —The date of a judgment will be taken as the date of the
debt upon which it was rendered, unless the contrary appear of record.
Mebane v. Layton, 89-396; Buie v. Scott, 107-181.
Against judgments for torts.—The homestead can be claimed against
judgments in actions of tort. Dellinger v. Tweed, 66-206 (Pearson, C J.,
and Rodman, J., dissenting); Gill v. Edwards, 87-76.
Against judgments for devastavit.—The liability of an executor for a
devastavit attaches at the date of his qualification, and of an adminis
trator at the date of his bond, and against a judgment for the devastavit,
they are only entitled to the exemptions in force at the date of qualifi
cation or giving bond. Leach v. Jones, 86-404.
Waiver.—The title to a homestead can only be divested from the owner
by deed, with the consent of the wife, evidenced by her privy examina
tion. Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348; Beavau v. Speed, 74-544; Jenkins v.
Bobbin, 77-385.
Contra. —Section 8, art. 10 of the constitution, applies only to a con
veyance of a homestead after it has been laid oft. Mayho v. Cotton.
69-289.
An unembarrassed owner of land, no matter when the land was
acquired, can convey the same, absolutely, or by way of trust or mort
gage, free of all homestead rights, without the assent of his wife,
except in the following cases: (1) Where the land in question has been
allotted to him as a homestead, either on his own petition or by an offi
cer, in accordance with law; (2) where no homestead has been allotted,
but there are judgments against him which constitute a lien upon the
land, and upon which execution might issue and make it necessary to
have his homestead allotted ; (3) where no homestead has been allotted,
but he has made a mortgage, reserving an undefined homestead, which
mortgage constitutes a lien on the land that could not be foreclosed
without allotting a homestead; (4) where the conveyance is fraudulent as
to creditors, and no homestead has been allotted in other lands. Adrian
v. Shaw, 82-474, modified Hughes v. Hodges, 102-236.
Estoppel.—A party entitled to homestead is not estopped by accepting
a lease from a purchaser at execution sale, though he cannot set up his
right of homestead during the pendency of his lease nor without sur
rendering possession to his lessor. Abbott v. Cromartie, 72-292.
Conveyance or sale, "subject to homestead."—A conveyance of a tract of
land, excepting "so much thereof as may be laid off and assigned as a
homestead under the act of assembly, is not objectionable for uncer
tainty, and the exception should be allowed to have effect." Branch,
ex parte, 72-106.
Where land is sold at execution sale, " subject to homestead," the pur
chaser takes subject to the incumbrance, even though the debt be one
against which no such right exists. Wyche v. Wyche, 86-96; Barrett v.
Richardson, 76-429; Lowdermilk v. Corpening, 92-323.

rupt "subject to his homestead exemption," is valid and the bankrupt
can still have it laid off after such sale. Murray v. Hazell, 99-168.
Income from a homestead.—The income from a homestead is not exempt
from execution. Bank v. Green, 78-247.
Homestead and exemption can neither be increased nor diminished. —The
legislature can neither increase nor diminish the value or duration of the
homestead and personal property exemption as fixed by the constitu
tion. Wharton v. Taylor, 88-230, overruling Martin v. Hughes, 67-209.
Widow. —Widow not entitled to both dower and homestead. Watts v.
Leggett, 66-197.
A widow cannot have a homestead laid off for herself and minor chil
dren, when her husband died leaving no debts. Hager v. Nixon, 69-108.
But the homestead, whether laid off in husband's life-time or to his
widow (there being no children), cannot be divested in favor of the heir
by the release or payment of the deceased husband's debts. Tucker v.
Tucker, 103-170.
The widow is not entitled to a homestead in the lands of her husband
if he die leaving children, whether minors or adults. Wharton v. Leg
gett, 80-169.
The acceptance of a homestead laid off in the life-time of her husband,
by a widow, is no bar to her right of dower in the other lands of her hus
band, outside of such homestead. McAfee v. Bettis, 72-28.
A married woman has no interest or estate in the reversion which takes
effect after the homestead estate, and her consent to its conveyance is
not necessary. Jenkins v. Bobbitt, 77-385.
Children. —The minor heirs of one who died before the adoption of the
constitution of 1868, are not entitled to homestead in his lands. Sluder
v. Rogers, 64-289.
Where a sale of land was made by an administrator under an order of
court, for the purpose of making real estate assets, in a proceeding to
which certain infant heirs at law were not made parties by personal ser
vice of process, which laud was afterwards set apart to such infants as a

the residue of the purchase-money cancelled. Shields v. Allen, 77-375.
Where a man dies without having had his homestead set apart, and
dower has been assigned to the widow, the children are entitled to a
homestead sub viodo, i. c, to a present interest, whose enjoyment is
postponed till the death of the dowress. Watts v. Leggett, 66-197;
Graves v. Hines, 10S-262.

and one a minor, the homestead estate vests alone in the minor until its
majority. Simpson v. Wallace, 83-477.
The widow and children have only the same rights of homestead, as
if the husband and father had not neglected to have his homestead laid
off in his life-time. Gregory v. Ellis, 86-579; Watts v. Leggett, 66-197.
In an eqnity of redemption. —A debtor is entitled to a homestead in au
equity of redemption, subject to the mortgage debt. Cheatham v. Jones,
68-153; Burton v. Spiers, 87-87.
A mortgagor is entitled to a homestead in the equity of redemption,
and the homestead may be set apart by metes and bounds, unless it
would impair the sale of the property, in which case the surplus money
arising threfrom, after payment of debt and costs, will be paid over to
mortgagor. Hinson v. Adrian, 92-121.
The equitable interest of the husband, the resulting trust in four undi
vided sevenths, could not be sold to satisfy his creditors without allotting
his homestead in it, if no homestead had been previously laid off to him.
The debtor, in such case, is entitled to claim a homestead in the equity,
as he may do where his deed conveying the legal as well as equitable
estate in hand is set aside for fraud. Thurber v. LaRoque, 105-301.
The right of a debtor to a homestead is superior to that of all creditors,
except so far as it may be impaired by the voluntary act of the claimant.
Pope v. Harris, 94-62.
Under some circumstances, a mortgagee may be required to sell a part
of the mortgaged land sufficient to satisfy his debt, in order that the
mortgagor may have a homestead allotted in the residue. Weil v. Uzzell,
92-515The homestead interest is favored by the constitution, and a mortgagor
has a right to have his homestead exonerated by applying the proceeds
of the excess above it to the payment of a prior mortgage debt in prefer
ence to other liens upon the homestead or upon his other lands. Leak
v. Gay, 107-468.
In a remainder. —A homestead cannot be taken in a remainder depend
ent upon a life-estate. In order to constitute a homestead, the interest
in the land must be such as carries with it a present right of occupancy.

execution as she would be entitled to if she were a feme sole. Flaum v.
Wallace, 103-296.

tory contract, who has paid a portion of the price, at once becomes enti
tled to a homestead therein, subject to the lien for the unpaid purchasemoney. Dortch v. Benton, 98-190.
Non-resident. —The right to a homestead depends upon residence in the
state. Baker v. Leggett, 98-304.
Where a debtor, a resident of the state, mortgaged property to which
he would have been entitled as homestead, and then removed from the
state, and afterwards but prior to the registration of the mortgage, the
judgment creditor had it levied upon and sold under an attachment, the
judgment creditor obtained a good title. Ibid.
The person claiming a homestead must be a resident of the state. If
he voluntarily removes therefrom with a purpose to make his home else
where, he forfeits his right in this respect. Finley v. Saunders, 98-462.
Where the facts show an actual removal from the state, even for a
definite period, the person so removing ceases, so long as he remains
absent, to be "a resident of the state" in respect of his right to a home
stead, although he may have the intent to return and resume his resi
dence therein. Munds v. Cassidey, 98-558; Lee v. Moseley, 101-311.
The words, " a resident of this state," employed in the constitution
(art. 10, \ 2) in respect to homesteads, have a more restricted meaning
than that usually given to domicile; to entitle a person to the constitu
tional exemption, he must be an actual and not a constructive resident.
Lee v. Moseley, 101-311.
Fraudulent grantor. —The fraudulent grantor of land is not deprived of
his right to a homestead therein as against his creditors. Crummen v.
Bennett, 68-494; Arnold v. Estis. 92-162; Rankin v. Shaw, 94-405; Dortch
v. Benton, 98-190; Hughes v. Hodges, 102-236.
Where a judgment debtor has conveyed the tract of land on which he
lived to a son, in fraud of creditors, and, after judgments were obtained
and executions issued against him, other lands, valued at less than one
thousand dollars by the appraisers, and not including that tract, were
allotted to him as a homestead, and he made no exception thereto, he
was estopped from claiming that the homestead should be extended to
the lands so fraudulently conveyed, and its sale under execution and
sheriff's deed would make a valid title in the purchaser. Whitehead v.
Spivey, 103-66.
Homestead not valid against judgment for "betterments. — As the improve
ments put on land by a defendant belong to him in equity, the plaintiff
is not entitled to a homestead in the improved lands, against a judgment
for the improvements. Barker v. Owen, 93-198.
Not valid against claim for purchase-money. —Where land was sold to make
assets, and the administrator made a deed reciting payment of purchasemon^y, but it was not in fact paid, the effect of the arrangement was not
to discharge the original indebtedness, but to assign it to the plaintiff;
and the defendant was not entitled to have the land exempted as a home
stead from sale under process to enforce a judgment rendered thereon.
Lawson v. Pringle, 98-450.
A debt contracted for purchase-money of land is no lien, but against
a judgment thereon the homestead cannot be set up. Smith v. High,
85-93; Toms v. Kite, 93-274; Fox v. Brooks, 88-234; Miller v. Miller,
S9-402.
Inaction to recover land.— In an action to recover land, if the defendant
desires to claim a homestead therein, he should assert his right by proper
averment in the answer. Wilson v. Taylor, 98-275; Oakley v. Van Noppen, 95-60.
When real property incapable of division. —Although the real property of
a judgment debtor is incapable of division, and although it would be
more advantageous to creditors to have it sold, the court has no power
to order a sale of the land, and a payment to the debtor of one thousand
dollars in money in lieu of his homestead. Campbell v. White, 95-491;
Oakley v. Van Noppen, 96-247.
Proceeds of sale of homestead. —When the homestead is sold, the pro
ceeds lose the quality of homestead exemption, and become subject to
the personal property exemption. Lane v. Richardson, 104-642.
Grantee of homestead. — Exemption from sale under execution against
the homesteader follows the land when conveyed by him to another
party, and it is exempt from the debts of the vendor for bis life at least.
Simpson v. Houston, 97-344; Lane v. Richardson, 101-181; Adrian v.
Shaw, 82-474; Ibid, 84-832; Littlejohn v. Egerton, 77-379.
Exoneration of homestead. — Mortgagees are entitled to share pro rata in
proceeds of a trust sale so as to exonerate pro rata the mortgaged prem
ises and relieve the homestead. Butler v. Stainback, 87-216; Curlee v.
Thomas, 74-51.
See, also, Leak v. Gay, 107-468, supra.
Marshalling assets.—The rule of equity in marshalling assets has no
reference to a case where the homestead is involved. Wilson v. Patton,
87-318.
Conveyance of homestead. —When the wife docs not join with the hus
band in making the deed, the status of the land as a homestead is unal
tered. Simpson v. Houston, 97-344.
Not occupied or claimed at the time of sile.—Where a purchaser of land
at execution sale obtained a rule upon the sheriff who sold the land, to
require him to execute a conveyance, and the sheriff gave as a reason
for his refusal to make the deed, that the defendant in the execution
claimed the land as a homestead, but it appeared that it had not been
laid off, and was not occupied or claimed as a homestead at the time of
sale, the rule should be made absolute. Scott v. Walton, 67-109.
Lien of attachment, —Where an attachment is levied on the land of a
non-resident who subsequently and prior to judgment in the action
becomes a resident of the state, the lien of the attachment is paramount
to the homestead right. Watkins v. Overby, 83-165.
After judgment a defendant is entitled to his exemptions in property
seized in attachment. Gamble v. Rhyne,' 80-183.
Assignee of homestead without consideration. —A purchaser of property
exempt from execution under the homestead act, cannot be held liable
as executor de son tori; and an assignment of such property by a debtor
without valuable consideration is not, therefore, fraudulent. Winches
ter v. Gaddy, 72-115.
Lien lost as against homestead. —T)ie lien acquired by the levy of a jus
tice's execution on the 27th of February, 1868, is lost by the plaintiff's
taking out a new execution on the first day of August following; and
sale under the latter must be made subject to the denfendant's right to
a homestead. Martin v. Meredith, 71-214.
The lien created by a levy made under execution, prior to the adop
tion of the constitution of 1868, is lost by a failure to take out a ven. ex.
and the issuing of an alias fi. fa. after the constitution went into effect.
James v. West, 76-290.
Note. —Since the decision of Edwards v. Kearsey, 96 V. S., 595,
debts contracted prior to 1868 are paramount to the homestead claim,
though no lien has been obtained by a levy.
Homestead of bankrupt. —The homestead of a defendant bankrupt is
protected from sale under execution by operation of the U. S. Rev.
Stat., '(, 5045, without regard to the date of the judgment lien. Lamb v.
Chamness, 84-379.
The extent in value and duration of a homestead allotment, made in
the bankrupt court, is the sams as is prescribed by the law of the state.
Windley v. Tankard, 88-223.
Where, in an action to foreclose a mortgage executed by the defend
ant in 1861, it appeared that the defendant had obtained a discharge in
bankruptcy in 1873, and that the mortgaged premises had teen allotted
to him as a homestead by proceedings in the bankrupt court, the plain
tiff was entitled to a decree of foreclosure. Brown v. Hoover, 77-40.
A discharge in bankruptcy bars the collection of a debt contracted for
the purchase of land, which has been allotted to the debtor as a home
stead in the proceedings in bankruptcy. Hoskins v. Wall, 77-249.
A homestead is allowed against a judgment obtained on a new promise
to pay a debt discharged by bankruptcy. Fralev v. Kelly, 88-227.
The plaintiff, having been adjudicated a bankrupt, and the land in
controversy having been assigned to him as his homestead in the bank
ruptcy proceedings, it is exempt from sale under execution issued on a
judgment for a fiduciary debt which is not discharged by his discharge in
bankruptcy. Simpson v. Houston, 97-344.
Homestead, how laid off. —A homestead may be laid off in two tracts not
contignous. Martin v. Hughes, 67-293.
It need not embrace the dwelling-house if the homesteader elect to
take it elsewhere. Mayho v. Cotten, 69-289; Flora v. Robbins, 93-38.
The method of procedure in allotting the homestead is suggested by
the court. Burtqn v. Spiers, 87-87.
The validity of a homestead allotment cannot be impeached by matter
in pais, but the aggrieved party may apply to the court to which the
execution and attachment are returnable. Ibid.
Homestead not subject to re-valuation. —Where the homestead has once
been regularly laid off it cannot be disturbed by laying it off a second
time at the instance of a judgment creditor whose debt was in existence
when the allotment was made, except for fraud or other irregularity.
Gully v. Cole, 96-447; Ibid, 102-333.
Fine and costs. —The defendant is not entitled to his personal property
and homestead against a fine. He can now only be discharged by stay
ing in prison twenty days and taking the oath that he has not fifty dol
lars in any property whatsoever, The Code, jj 2972. The decision to the
contrary in State v. Davis, 82-610, was made before that section was
amended by ch. 76, acts 1881. State v. Williams, 97-414.
NOTE.—An additional remedy is given by ch. 191, j>3, acts 1887, allow
ing the judgment for fines to be docketed.

In addition to the foregoing articles, there shall be, in
favor of every housekeeper complying with this chapter,
exempt from execution on debts contracted since the first

one cow and calf, ten bushels of corn or wheat, fifty pounds
of bacon, beef or pork, or one barrel of fish, all necessary
farming tools for one laborer, one bed, bedstead and cover
ing for every two members of the family, and such other
property as the freeholders appointed for that purpose may
deem necessary for the comfort and support of such debtor's
family, such other property not to exceed in value the sum
of fifty dollars at cash valuation: Provided, that this section
shall not be extended to any person against whom judg
ment is obtained and execution awarded for liability in
curred for failure or neglect to work on the public roads,
or to muster, or pay his poll-tax.
What is exempt. —Under Rev. Code, ch. 45, a chose in action cannot be
allotted as a part of the exemption. Bullard v. Walker, 52-84.
If an article allotted as a part of the exemption is exchanged for
another, the latter article is not exempt unless set apart by a second
allotment. Lloyd v. Durham, 60-282.
The personal property exemption against a debt contracted in 1860 is
only such as was allowed by the law then in force, viz., Rev. Code, ch.
45. \\ 7 and 8. Carlton v. Watts, 82-212.
The personal property exemption allowed by \ 7, ch. 45, Rev. Code,
can only be claimed if actually allotted during the debtor's life-time.
Grant v. Hughes, 82-216.
Homestead void against debt contracted prior to the Constitution. —It is the
duty of the sheriff, when selling land under execution, to lay off the
homestead, even when the judgment is for an old debt to which the
homestead does not apply. Arnold v. Estis, 92-162; Cobb v. Hallyburton, 92-652; McCandless v. Flinchum, 98-358; McCracken v. Adler,
98-400; Morrison v. Watson, 101-332.
Note. —These cases are overruled by Long v. Walker, 105-90, in which
the above and all other cases are reviewed and the doctrine settled that
as to debts contracted prior to the adoption of the constitution, the
homestead is non-existent, and the sheriff is not required to lay off a
homestead before selling under execution issued on a judgment for such
debt.
Homestead in proceeds of sale of excess. —Where a homestead is sold to
satisfy a debt created before the ratification of the constitution of 1868,
one thousand dollars of the proceeds of sale, if that sum is left over
after paying the old debt, will be treated as a homestead. Leak v. Gay,
107-468.
Homestead by acquiescence. —In 1869, the plaintiff's intestate obtained
judgment against the ancestor of the defendants, on debts contracted in
1866, and a homestead was allotted to the defendant, which, at his death,
was re-allotted to his infant children, the present defendants. A peti
tion was filed by the debtor's administrator to sell the homestead to
make assets to pay the judgment: Held, (1) that by assenting for so
long a time to the homestead allotment, and by availing themselves of
the provision of the statute, which prevented the judgments from being
barred, the creditois were precluded from denying the right of the infants
to the homestead; (2) that the creditors were entitled to have the rever
sion after the determination of the homestead, not the absolute estate
in the land, sold to pay their debts. Cobb v. Halyburton, 92-652.

grantor's property, except such part as the law allows poor debtors, prop
erty which could have been, but which had not actually been set apart
as exempted, passes by deed. West v. Massey, 52-143. See, also, cases
above cited.
The record of allotment. —A record of an allotment of articles as ex
empted to a person shown not to have been at the time in the posses
sion of them, is not admissible in evidence in a suit for these articles
between third persons. Weaver v. Parker, 61-479.
Mode of reviewing the allotment. —The proper way of reviewing the
action of commissioners, upon an allegation of improper allotment,
under ch. 45, Rev. Code, is by a rccordari in the nature of a writ of false
judgment. Ballard v. Walker, 52-84.
Note. —The mode of review now provided is found in ^ 519, post.
Attachment levied on exempted property. — Qiucrc, whether propertyexempt from execution can be attached where the owner fraudulently
evades service of process? But an absence as a soldier in the army is
not such an evasion. Abrams v. Pender, 44-260.
Liability of an officer for levying upon exempt property. —An officer is not
liable for levying upon and selling a gun used for mustering, unless
he knows or has good reason to believe that it was so used by the defend
ant in the execution. Ilenson v. Edwards, 32-43.
See \ 516/post, and cases cited.
Widow's year's support not exempt as against husband's debts.— Personal
property allotted to a widow as her year's support is liable to an execu
tion issued on a judgment recovered against the husband in his life
time. Grant v. Hughes, 82-216.
NOTE. —This is changed by ch. 42, acts of 1S80.
lS(i(!-'7, e. 61, s. 7. JS79, c. 250, ». 1.

The property, real and personal, as set forth in article
ten of the constitution of the state.
Invalid against debts contracted prior to the adoption of Constitution. —The
homestead and personal property exemption is valid against debts con
tracted prior to its adoption. Hill v. Kessler, 63-437; Jacobs v. Smallwood, 63-112; Crummen v. Bennett, 68-494; Garrett v. Cheshire, 69-396;'
Abbott v. Cromartie, 72-292; Wilson v. Sparks, 72-208; Edwards v. Kearsey, 74-241; Barrett v. Richardson, 76-429. Overruled. The home
stead and personal property exemption is not good against debts con
tracted prior to its adoption. Edwards v. Kearsey, 96 U. S., 595; Earl
v. Hardie, 80-177; Carlton v. Watts, 82-212; Dail v. Sugg, 85-104; Leach
v. Jones, 86-404; Keener v. Goodson, 89-273.
Effect of levy prior to adoption'of the homestead. — Specific liens previously
obtained, as by levy, are not divested by the homestead clause of the
constitution of 1868. McKeithan v. Terry, 64-25.
The same as to a deed in trust to pay debts made before the adoption
of the constitution. Sluder v. Rogers, 64-2S9.
But no such lien is acquired by a levy after the adoption of the con
stitution, though the execution bears teste before. Ladd v. Adams,
66- 164; Horton v. McCall, 66-159.
The constitution of 1868 went into effect 011 the 24th of April of that
year, for all purposes of domestic policv; so that a levy on the 25th of
June, 1868, did not forestall the right of homestead. Pemberton v.
McRae, 75-497Notk. —These decisions have no bearing since the overruling of Hill v.
Kessler as to the retroactive effect of the homestead. They are given
merely as a part of the history of the decisions upon the subject.
Authority of the legislature over the homestead. —The act of i869-'70, ch.
121, exempting from execution the reversionary interests in homesteads,
is constitutional. Poe v. Hardie, 65-447.
The general assembly cannot reduce the homestead, but may enlarge
the same, both as to value and duration of the estate. Martin v. Hughes,
67-293.
The general assembly can neither enlarge nor reduce the homestead
and personal property exemption as fixed by the constitution. {Over
ruling Martin v. Hughes). Wharton v. Taylor, 88-230.
Homestead a determinable fee. —The homestead is a determinable fee, the
owner of which is not impeachable for waste. Poe v. Hardie, 65-447.
Suspension of statute of limitations upon judgments. —The suspension or
the statute of limitations upon judgments as to the reversionary interest
in homestead, applies only where the judgment has been docketed in
the county where the land lies and the homestead has been allotted.
McDonald v. Dickson, 85-248; Cotten v. McClenahan, 85-254.
Against a note given in renewal of an old debt. —A note given since 1&68
in renewal of an old one, is a new contract, and subject to the home
stead. Wilson v. Patton, 87-318.
Owelty ofpartition. —Where there is a charge for equality of partition the
defendant is entitled to his homestead after deducting from the value of
the land the amount of the charge for owelty. Thompson v. Peebles,
85-418.
1870-'7, c 253. ». 1. 1885, c. 359. 1887, c. 17.
(4) Upon debts contracted or causes of action accruing since
May first, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven.
The property, real and personal, specified in sub-division
three of this section, and the homestead of any resident of
this state shall not be subject [to the lien of any judgment
or decree of any court, or] to sale under execution or other
process thereon, except such as may be rendered or issued
to secure the payment of obligations contracted for the
purchase of the said real estate, or for laborers' or mechanics'
liens, for work done and performed for the claimant of said
homestead, or for lawful taxes: Provided, the statute of
limitations shall not run against any [payment owing by]
judgment against the owner of a homestead interest during
the existence of such homestead or homestead interest
whether the same has been or shall hereafter be allowed,
assigned and set apart under execution or otherwise.
Note. —By ch. 359, acts 1885, the words in the third and fourth lines
of this subsection above enclosed in brackets were stricken out and the
"proviso " as above was added. By ch. 17, acts 1887, the words in the
proviso above set out in brackets were stricken out and the words "judg
ment against" were substituted in their stead. To read the subsectioii
as it now stands, simply omit all words within brackets.
The effect of the amendments.—Since the passage of the act of 1885, ch.
359, a judgment is a lien on the homestead interest. Qitare, whether
this act affects causes of action accruing prior to its passage. Rankin
v. Shaw, 94-405.
Chapter 359, acts 1885, amendatory of the homestead law, and repeal
ing the clause exempting homestead from the lien of judgments, does
not impair the obligations of a contract or interfere with vested rights
by being allowed to operate retrospectively, so as to include judgments
upon debts contracted before it became a law and while The Code,
J 501 (4), was in operation. Leak v. Gay, 107-468.
The restoration of the lien of a judgment, under the act of 1885, does
not affect the judgment debtor's right to exoneration, or his power to
encumber his homestead by conveyance executed in compliance with
$ 8, art. 10 of the constitution. Leak v. Gay, 107-482.
Homestead not exempt against collection of the purchase-money. —The home
stead is not good against judgment for purchase-money. Durham v.
Bostick, 72-353; Whitaker v. Elliott, 73-186; Durham v. Wilson, 104-595;
Toms v. Fite, 93-274; Dail v. Sugg, 85-104.
No property is exempt from execution issued upon a judgment ren
dered for a debt contracted for the purchase thereof. Smith v. High,
85-93Where a purchaser, in payment for a tract of land, endorsed to the
vendor certain notes payable to himself, he cannot claim a homestead
in the land so purchased against a judgment rendered against him on
said notes as endorser. Whitaker v. Elliott, 73-186.
No vendor's lien for purchase-money. —While land is- not exempt, under
the provisions of the constitution and statutes providing for a home
stead, from sale for its purchase-money, no lien exists in favor of the
vendor until he shall have reduced his debt to judgment and had it
docketed as required of other judgments. Hoskins v. Wall, 77-249;
Smith v. High, 85-93; Hardy v. Carr, 104-33.
Good against a debt for money borrowed to pay for the homestead. —Where a
purchaser of land borrows money to pay for it, such debt is no lien on
the lot purchased, and he can assert his homestead therein against a
judgment obtained upon the debt. Brodie v. Batchelor, 75-51.
Not good against note for price. —Where a bargainee of land contracted,
as a part of the price, to pay a note due by the obligor to a third party,
the homestead cannot be claimed in the land against a judgment on such
note. Fox v. Brooks, 88-234.
Debt for purchase-money of homestead discharged by bankruptcy. —A dis
charge in bankruptcy bars the collection of a debt contracted for the
purchase of land which has been allotted to the debtor as a homestead
in bankruptcy. Hoskins v. Wall, 77-249.
Homestead not affected by a lien for materials. —The homestead right is
not affected by a lien for materials furnished and used on land covered
by the homestead and the act of assembly (B. R., 65, \ 1) in so far as it
gave such a lien is unconstitutional. Cumming v. Bloodworth, 87-83.
In a sale to make assets. —Where, in a proceeding to sell land to make
assets, it appears that the debts contracted by the deceased prior to the
adoption of the homestead exceed the value of the personalty, a sale
should be ordered without exempting the homestead. A discrimination
between debts contracted before and after the homestead can only be
exercised, if at all, when the proceeds of the sale are brought into court
for distribution. Gamble v. Watterson, 83-573.
Reversionary interest. —The act forbidding sale of the reversionary
interest is constitutional. Poe v. Hardie, 65-447.
The reversionary interest in a homestead cannot be sold by an admin
istrator, in a petition to make real estate assets, during the minority of
one of the children of the intestate. Hinsdale v. Williams, 75-4.50.
See Wharton v. Taylor, 88-230, cited under preceding subsection.
No lien on the homestead or its reversion is acquired by docketing a
judgment rendered on contracts entered into subsequent to May I, 1S77,
unless the judgment is for the purchase-money of the homestead, or for
laborer's or mechanic's lieu for labor and work thereon, or for taxes.
Markham v. Hicks, 90-204: Utley v. Jones, 92-261.
The statute of limitations does not run against a debt owing by a
homesteader, during the existence of his interest in the homestead, pro
vided the same has been laid off. Morton v. Barber, 90-399.
The act of the 25th of March, 1S70, which prohibits the sale of the
reversionary interest in land charged with the homestead exemption,
cannot deprive a creditor of a vested right acquired by docketing his
judgment before the act was passed. Lowdermilk v. Corpening, 92-333.
The act declaring that the statute of limitations shall not run against
any debt owing by the homestead, which is affected by the act forbid
ding the sale of the reversion (Bat. Rev., ch. 55, \ 26), has been repealed,
together with the act forbidding such sale by not being brought for
ward in The Code of 18S3, and the statute begins to run against such
debts from November 1st, 18S3, when the repealing act (The Code) went
into effect. Cobb v. Hallyburton, 92-652.
A judgment was recovered and docketed against W., in 1877, on a debt
in 1874. After the judgment, in the same year, he conveyed his lands,
of less value than £1,000, to purchasers for value; in 1880 W. died, leav
ing no widow or minor children surviving him, and administration was
granted upon his estate in the same year: Held, (1) that the judgment
was a lien upon the lands owned by W. at the time of the docketing
thereof, subject to his right to a homestead, and that, upon his death,
the creditor might enforce that lien against the purchasers; (2) that an
action commenced in 1884 to enforce this remedy was not barred by the
statute of limitations. Rogers v. Kimsey, 101-559.
A judgment is now a lien on land subject to homestead. Jones v. Brittain, 102-166.
r
Income, acquisitions and increase.—The income derived from a home
stead, and all acquisitions of property derived from such income, and
the natural increase of personal property set apart as the personal prop
erty exemption, are all liable to sale under execution. Bank v. Green,
78-247.
Sec. 502. Sheriff' to summon appraisers. IS(iS-'!t, r. l.'iT,
s. 2.
Before levying upon the real estate of any resident of
this state, who is entitled to a homestead under this chap
ter, and the constitution of this state, article ten, the sher
iff or other officer charged with such levy, shall summon
three discreet persons qualified to act as jurors, to whom he
shall administer the following oath : "I, A B, do solemnly
swear (or affirm) that I have no interest, near or remote, in
the homestead exemption of C D, and that I will faithfully
perform the duties of appraiser (or assessor, as the case may7
be) in valuing and laying off the same : So help me, God."
. If the owner does not petition for homestead, the creditor must pay the fees
for the allotment. —Where the owner of rand does not petition for a home
stead, it is the duty of the officer to lay it off at the expense of the cred
itor, and if he refuses to pay the fees, the officer will be justified in refus
ing to serve the process. Lute v. Reilly, 65-20; Taylor v. Rhyne, 65-530;
Vannoy v. Haymore, 71-128.
Allotment not necessary to vest title.—The title to the homestead is vested
in the owner by the constitution, and no allotment by the sheriff is nec
essary to vest his title thereto. Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348; Abbott v.
Cromartie, 72-222; Lute v. Reilly, 65-20; C rum men v. Benuett, 68-494;
Duval v. Rollins, 71-248; Littlejohn v. Egerton, 77-379; Gheen v. Summey, 80-187.
But the allotment is necessary to ascertain whether there is an excess
subject to execution. Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348.
Exceptions to appraisers.—An objection to the appraisers or any one of
them should be made in apt time to the sheriff, aud if not allowed by
him, then by application to the township trustees; and if not allowed by
them, it must be raised by petition in a special proceeding. If the objec
tion is not made in apt time, it is held to be waived. Chambers v. Penland, 74-340.
The exception to the qualification of an appraiser must be taken
before he enters upon the discharge of his duty. Burton v. Spiers, 87-87.
It must appear from the return that the appraisers were sworn. — Persons
appointed to lay off a homestead and allot personal property exemption,
must be sworn, and it must appear affirmatively from their return that
they were sworn; and they must make such a descriptive list of the per
sonal property as will enable creditors to ascertain what property is
exempted; and when these requirements are not complied with, their
proceedings may be treated as a nullity by creditors. Smith v. Hunt,
68-482; Coble v." Thom, 72-121.
Failure to allot. —A homestead cannot be defeated by a failure of the
sheriff to have it laid off by metes and bounds. Littlejohn v. Egerton,
77-379.
Allotment not necessary, when. —Where land is subject to the payment
of debts against which, under the constitution, the right of the home
stead does not prevail, and the debtor has no other property but the
land, which is of less value than one thousand dollars, the sheriff need
not have the homestead laid off in order to a sale under execution. And
the deed of the sheriff to the purchaser in such case is not affected by
his failure to lay off the homestead. Miller v. Miller, 89-402.
Note. —No allotment of homestead is necessary either where the judg
ment is on a debt contracted for the purchase-money of the homestead,
or for a debt contracted prior to the adoption of the homestead. See
cases cited under 3501, ante; especially Long v. Walker, 105-90, in
which the authorities are reviewed and the doctrine settled.
Appraisers summoned by constable. —A constable to whom an execution
from the court of a justice of the peace has been delivered may summon
appraisers and administer to thern the prescribed oath. McAuley v.
Morris, 101-369.
Sec. 503. Duty of appraiser». 1808-'9, c. 137, s. 3.
The said appraisers shall thereupon proceed to value the
homestead, with its dwelling and buildings thereon, and

lay off to said owner such portion as he may select, or to
any agent, attorney, or other person in his behalf, not
exceeding in value one thousand dollars, and to fix and
describe the same by metes and bounds.
Allotment too vague.—The allotment of "an interest of $ioo " in certain
property as a part of the exemption is so vague and indefinite, that it is
void. Coble v. Thom, 72-121.
Allotment not too vague. —In laying off a homestead, it is not necessary
for the appraisers to run it off by course and distance, and any descrip
tion by which the land can be located, is a compliance with the pro
visions of the statute. Ray v. Thornton, 95-571.
Allotment must be in severalty. —The constitutional provision for a home
stead, and the statutes enacted in pursuance thereof, require a specific
allotment of the homestead in severalty, and does not permit any com
munity of interest between the homesteader and the purchaser of the
excess. Campbell v. White, 95-491.
Must be allotted in realty, and not in its proceeds. —Although the real
property of a judgment debtor is incapable of division the court has no
power to order a sale of the land and a payment of one thousand dol
lars out of proceeds in lieu of homestead. Oakley v. Van Noppen,
96-247; Campbell v. White, 95-491.
Value of buildings must be included.—In allotting the homestead, the
value of the buildings erected on the land must be considered by the
appraisers, for the homesteader is not entitled to one thousand dollars
worth of land, and also the buildings which may be on it. Ray v.
Thornton, 95-571.
Debtor's right to elect.—The debtor's choice is not restricted to the tract
on which he resides nor to contiguous tracts. Mavho v. Cotten, 69-289.
Where a judgment debtor owns several town lots, some of which—
including that whereon is his dwelling encumbered by prior liens (mort
gages) to the extent of their full value, and the others are unencum
bered, he has the right to have his homestead allotted from the unen
cumbered lands without reference to whether they embraced his dwell
ing and other buildings. Flora v. Robbins, 93-38.
Judgment creditors cannot complain of the homesteader's election to
take the present value of his homestead. Leak v. Gay, 107-482.
Manner of allotment. —Method of procedure in allotting homestead sug
gested. Burton v. Spiers, 87-87.
Sec. l>04. Appraisers to make return. 18(i8-'9, c. 137,
*. 4. 1885, c. 272.
They shall then make and sign in the presence of the
officer a return of their proceedings, setting forth the prop
erty exempted, which shall be returned by the officer to
the clerk of the court for the county in which the home
stead is situated and filed with the judgment-roll in the
action, and a minute of the same entered on the judgment
docket, and a certified copy thereof under the hand of the
clerk shall be registered in the office of the register of
deeds for the county, " and said officer shall likewise make
a transcript of said returns over his hand and return the
same without delay to the clerk of the court of the county
from whence the execution issues, and said clerk shall
likewise file and make a minute of the same as above
directed," and in all judicial proceedings the original
return or a certified copy thereof may be read in evidence.
NOte.—The words in qnotation marks were inserted in this section by
ch. 272, acts 1885.
Homestead not subject to re-allotment. —If a homestead has been regu
larly laid off it cannot be re-allotted at the instance of a creditor whose
debt was at that time in existence, except in case of fraud or irregu
larity. Gully v. Cole, 96-447; Ibid, 102-333; Thornton v. Van Story,
107-331Quare, as to the equitable remedy which creditors might have if the
homestead had increased in value since its allotment. Gully v. Cole,
96-447.
Requisites for the return. —Unless appraisers are sworn, and also return
a descriptive list sufficiently definite to identify the property set apart,
their proceedings are a nullity. Smith v. Hunt, 68-482.
Sec. 505. Levy to he made on the excess. 1808-'U, c. 137, »• O.
The levy may be made upon the excess of the homestead
not laid off according to this chapter, and the officer shall
make, substantially, the following return upon the execu
tion: "A B, C D, and E F summoned and qualified as
appraisers or assessors (as the case may be), who set off to
X Y the homestead exempt by law. Levy made upon the
excess. ' '
Land should not be sold till after the homestead is laid off. —A plaintiff, after
judgment in her favor, has no right to have the defendant's land sold
without first having his homestead laid off. The excess only, after a
homestead has been assigned to the defendant, is subject to execution
sale. Waters v. Stubbs, 75-28.
If land is sold without homestead set apart, sheriff must execute deed. —Where
a sheriff has sold laud under execution, without setting apart the home
stead, the purchaser can compel him to convey it. But this would not
debar the defendant in the execution of his right to the homestead.
Scott v. Walton, 67-109.
Sale invalid if no homestead laid off. —A sale without laying off the home
stead (except in cases where the judgment is for a debt, from the pay
ment of which the homestead is not exempt) is void, and passes no title
to the land or to the reversionary interest. Mebane v. Layton, 89-396.
If it appear that no homestead was laid off, the defendant in an action
brought by purchaser at execution sale may take advantage of it, though
not pleaded. Buie v. Scott, 107-181; Mobley v. Griffin, 104-112.
Land incapable of division. —Where it was found as a fact that the land
and buildings thereon, in which the homestead was claimed, were of the
value of £1,200, but were incapable of division, it was erroneous to direct
that the interest therein, proportionate to the excess, should be sold and
applied to the payment of the claims of the execution creditors. Camp
bell v. White, 95-491.
Nor can the court order the whole to be sold and $1,000 paid on the
execution out of proceeds; Oakley v. Van Noppen, 96-247; though, where
the whole is sold under a debt, against which the homestead was not
good, the court will treat $ 1,000 of the surplus as a homestead against
debts contracted since the adoption of the constitution, and direct its
payment to the homesteader. Wilson v. Patton, 87-318; Leak v. Gay,
107-468.
If land is subject to a mortgage.—Where the land laid off as a homestead
is subject to a mortgage, no question affecting the rights and priorities
of the mortgagee can be raised unless he is a party to the action. Ray
v. Thornton, 95-571.
The right to a homestead is superior to the equitable right of marshal
ling, and where there is one mortgage on the homestead tract, and the
same mortgage and another on another tract, the latter mortgagee's
right to have the assets marshalled is inferior to the debtor's right to a
homestead. Butler v. Staiuback, 87-216; Pope v. Harris, 94-62.
The excess must be sold in a prudent and just manner. —It is the duty of the
sheriff to lay off the homestead of the defendant in execution and to
sell the excess in a prudent and just manner. The sale of several par
cels of land en tnasse, and subject to the lien of the homestead, can be
avoided and set aside by any creditor not present nor consenting to such
sale. Andrews v. Pritchett, 72-135.
Sec. 500. No elect ion ; appraisers to elect. 180S-'!f, e. 13 7,
s. 0.
In case no election is made by the owner, his agent,
attorney, or anyone acting in his behalf, of the homestead
to be laid off as exempt, the appraisers shall make such
election for him, including always the dwelling and build
ings used therewith.
Homesteader must elect at time of appraisal.—The homesteader should
make his selection at the time of the appraisal and assignment, and give
notice of any exception to the action of the appraisers then, or within a
reasonable time thereafter, and before sale. Flora v. Robbius, 93-38.
Sec. 507' Personal property, how appraised ; how return
to be made. 1808-'9, c. 137, «». 12, 13.
Whenever the personal property of any resident of this
state shall be levied upon by virtue of any execution or
other final process issued for the collection of any debt, and
the owner or any agent, or attorney in his behalf, shall
demand that the same, or any part thereof, shall be exempt
from sale under such execution, the sheriff or other officer
making such levy, shall summon three appraisers, as here
tofore provided, who, having been first duly sworn, shall
appraise and lay off to the judgment debtor such articles of
personal property as he, or another in his behalf, may select,
and to which he may be entitled under this chapter and
the constitution of the state, in no case to exceed in value
five hundred dollars, which articles shall be exempt from
said levy, and return thereof shall be made by the apprais
ers, as upon the laying off of a homestead exemption.
Appraisers must make a descriptive list. —The freeholders appointed as
appraisers must be sworn, and it must appear that they were sworn; and
they must make such a descriptive list of the personal property as will
enable creditors to ascertain what property is exempt. When these
requirements are not complied with, their proceedings may be treated
as a nullity by creditors. Smith v. Hunt, 68-482.
Return. —A return of the appraisers of the personal property set apart,
which designates it with sufficient certainty, is all that the statute
requires. Ray v. Thornton, 95-571
The return of the appraisers of personal property exemptions should
be made to the clerk of the superior court, but an allotment is not vitia
ted by making it returnable to another place. The court has power to
direct the return shall be made to the proper officer, and it should exer
cise that power instead of dismissing the proceedings for defect in the
return. McAuley v. Morris, 101-369.
Not good against debts contracted prior to the adoption of the personal prop
erty exemption. —The personal property exemption is only such as was
secured to the debtor by the law in force at the date of the contract.
Carlton v. Watts, 82-212.
Note.—See the divers decisions settling this as to "homestead," cited
under \ 501 , ante.
Set apart in partnership property, when. —A personal property exemption
can be set apart in partnership property with the consent of the other
partners, but not otherwise. Burns v. Harris, 67-140.
And such consent may be withdrawn before allotment. Stout v.
McNeill, 98-1.
One partner, with the assent of the other, is entitled to have a personal
property exemption allotted to him out of the partnership property
before the partnership debts are paid, and it is immaterial that he has
individual property sufficient to make up the exemption. Scott v.
A partner is entitled to his personal property exemption out of the
partnership property before a debt due by him individually to his co-part
ner can be deducted therefrom, on a settlement of the partnership.
Evans v. Bryan, 95-174.
Liability of officer for refusal to set apart. —An officer who refuses to lay
off to the defendant, upon demand, his personal property exemption,
and levies upon the personal property, is guilty of a misdemeanor. State
v. Carr, 71-106.
Passes to the executor or administrator. —The personal property exemp
tion does not pass to the widow and children at death of the person enti
tled, but to the personal representative. Johnson v. Cross, 66-167; Welch
v. Macy, 78-240.
The personal property exemption exists only during the life of the
homesteader, and after his death his widow has no right to have it allot
ted to her. Smith v. McDonald, 95-163.
May be renewed from time to time. —The allotment of exempted prop
erty may be renewed from time to time, so as to keep constantly in pos
session of the citizen $500 worth of personal property for the comfort
.and support of himself and family. Frost v. Nailor, 68-325; Campbell
v. White, 95-344A debtor is entitled to have his personal property exemption ascer
tained up to and immediately before the sale. Pate v. Harper, 94-23.
Chose in action may be allotted.—A chose in action, if selected by the
owner, may be allotted as part of the personal property exemption.
Frost v. Naylor, 68-325.
Cannot be sold under an attachment. —The personal property of a resident
of this state, exempted from sale under execution, cannot be sold under
process of attachment. —Commissioners v. Riley, 75-144.
Effect of a sale by the owner. —Personal property when allotted as per
sonal property exemption can be sold and transferred by the owner, and
does not become liable to an execution against him while in the hands
of the purchaser; nor would it become so if the purchaser rescind the
contract and return the articles. Duval v. Rollins, 68-220.
A note held as part of the, personal property exemption of a judg
ment debtor loses its quality of exemption when assigned, and the
assignee holds it subject to the counterclaim of judgments against the
assignor owned by the maker of the note. Lane v. Richardson, 104-642.
As far as personal property is concerned, the right of exemption is
rsonal to the debtor, and it loses its quality of exemption as soon as
is transferred. Ibid.
Exemption not frorfeited by a fraudulent conveyance of property.—The per
sonal property exemption cannot be reached by execution nor forfeited
by any attempt to make a fraudulent conveyance. Duval v. Rollins,
71-218.
Good against judgments for tort. —The personal property exemption is
good against a judgment rendered in actions for tort. Dellinger v. Tweed,
66-206 (Pearson, C. J., and Rodman, J., dissenting); Gill v. Edward, 87-76.
Not good against fines. —The personal property exemption is good
against a judgment for a fine and costs. State v. Davis, 82-610.
Note. —This decision was rendered on the former statute allowing
an insolvent to swear out if he had "no property above exemptions
allowed by law." The next legislature (18S1, ch. 76) amended the oath,
The Code, § 2972, so as to allow only fifty dollars exemption. The
defendant is not entitled to his personal property or homestead exemp
tion -when imprisoned, till fine and cost are paid. State v. Williams,
97-4M.
By ch. 191, §3, acts 1887, an additional remedy is given by directing
that a judgment for a fine shall be docketed and become a lien on real
estate as any civil judgment.
Can be allotted in a judgment. —Two persons having docketed judgments
against each other upon a motion to apply one to the other, if one of
the parties has not five hundred dollars of personalty outside the judg
ment, the same would be a part of his exemption, and could not be so
applied. Duval v. Rollins, 71-218; Crummen v. Bennet, 69-494; Com
missioners v. Riley, 75-144.
Where A recovers judgment against B, who subsequently recovers a
judgment against A upon a cause of action existing when A's judgment
was taken, but which was not pleaded as a counterclaim, A's personal
property exemption will protect his judgment from being credited with
the amount of B's judgment upon motion made to that effect. Curlee v.
Thomas, 74-51.
Constitutional amount cannot be increased nor diminished. —The amount
of the personal property exemption and homestead, as fixed, in the
constitution, can neither be increased nor diminished by the'legislature. Wharton v. Taylor, 88-230. (Overruling Martin v. Hughes,
67-293),
Right to exemptions not waived. —A debtor has the right at any time
before sale under execution to demand that his personal property
exemption be laid off. A failure to make such demand at the time of the
levy is not a waiver of the right. Shepherd v. Murrill, 90-208.
No right to jury trial. —Questions of fact arising in the allotment of
property exempt from execution are not such " issues of fact " as entitle
the parties to a trial by jury. Beavaus v. Goodrich, 98-217.
Return may be corrected. —If property belonging to the judgment debtor
has been omitted by the appraisers, they have the power to correct the
allotment. Pate v. Harper, 94-23.
Estoppel.—After an execution has been returned with the allotment of
the personal property exemption, it becomes an estoppel (Burton v.
Spiers, 87-87); but, as long as the process remains in the officer's hands,
such allotment is in fieri and may be corrected. Pate v. Harper, 94-23.
Property embraced in an uuregistered mortgage.—While an unregistered
mortgage is not valid as to third parties, yet the lack of registration can
not subject to sale under execution property which would be exempt if
there were no mortgages. Pate v. Harper, 94-23.
Sec. 508. Appraisers to take an oath; fees of. 1808-'9,
c. 137, s. 14.
The persons summoned to appraise the personal property
exemption shall take the same oath and be entitled to the
same fees as the appraisers of the homestead, and when
both exemptions are claimed by the judgment debtor at
the same time, one board of appraisers shall lay off both
and be entitled to but one fee.
See Smith v. Hunt, 68-482, and Coble v. Thorn, 72-121, cited under
J 502, ante.
Sec. 500. Tract* not contiguous may be included in home
stead. 1808-'0, c. 137, s. 15.
Different tracts or parcels of land not contiguous may be
included in the same homestead, when a homestead of con
tiguous lands is not of the value of one thousand dollars.
Tracts not contiguous. —A homestead may be assigned in tracts of land
not contiguous. Martin v. Hughes, 67-293; McCracken v. Adler, 98-400.
Homestead need not embrace residence if homesteader elect another tract. —
The owner is not restricted to the tract on which he resides, nor to con
tiguous tracts, in the selection of a homestead. Mayho v. Cotton, 69-289.
Sec. 510. Costs, how taxed and by whom paid. ISOS-'O,
c. 137, s. 10.
The costs and expenses of appraising and laying off the
homestead or personal property exemptions, when the same
is made under execution, shall be charged and included in
the officer's bill of fees upon such execution or other final
process, and when made upon the petition of the owner,
they shall be paid by such owner, and the latter costs shall
be a lien on said homestead.
Sec. 511. Homestead and personal property exemption
may he set off upon petition. 1808-'0, c. 137, »• 7.
Whenever any resident of this state may desire to take
the benefit of the homestead and personal property exemp
tion as guaranteed by article ten of the constitution of this
state, or by this chapter, such resident, his agent or attor
ney, shall apply to any justice of the peace of the county
in which he resides, and said justice of the peace shall
appoint as assessors three disinterested persons qualified to
act as jurors, residing in said county, who shall, on notice,
by order of said justice, meet at the applicant's residence,
and, after taking the oath prescribed for appraisers before
some officer authorized to administer an oath, lay off and
allot to the applicant a homestead with metes and bounds,
according to the applicant's direction, not to exceed one
thousand dollars in value, and make and sign a descriptive
account of the same and return it to the office of the regis
ter of deeds.
Petitioner liable for costs.— If the homestead is laid off on the debtor's
petition, he is liable for the costs thereof. If he does not petition, the
sheriff must have it laid off at the expense of the creditor. Lute v.
Reilly, 65-20.
Can only be claimed where tbere is a present right of occupancy.—The home
stead cannot be claimed ill an interest in the land unless such interest
carries with it present right of occupancy. Murchison v. Plyler, 87-79.
Effect of allotment of homestead. —Where land was acquired and marriage
took place prior to March, 1867, the husband may convey the entire
estate without the concurrence of his wife, unless he has voluntarily
dedicated the property to the purposes of a homestead. Bruce v. Strick
land, 81-267.
The assignment of homestead does not constitute color of title. It is
not a conveyance, nor does it profess to pass title to the land, but simply
attaches to the existing estate of the homesteader a quality of exemption
from sale under execution. Miller v. Miller, 89-402,
Where land is allotted to a person as a homestead upon his own peti
tion, it is a dedication of it by him, to all the privileges, uses and restrictipns of a homestead, no matter at what time the title was acquired.
Without the joinder of the wife, the deed of the husband for such home
stead is a nullity, since the constitution of 1868. Castleberry v. Maynard, 95-281.
If the marriage and the acquisition of the land were both prior to the
constitution of 1868, and the husband procured a homestead to be allot
ted in such land, or an allotment has been made in which he acquiesced,
then the wife's right to a homestead would have arisen —subject to the
rights of prior creditors—which could not be divested except by her deed
duly executed. Gilmore v. Bright, 10-382.
If allotment is defective.—When the assignment of homestead is defect
ive, in that it does not set out the metes and bounds thereof, the supe
rior court is directed to appoint commissioners to re-allot the homestead,
Littlejohn v. Egerton, 77-379
Method of procedure. — Method of procedure in allotting homestead dis
cussed by Smith, C J. Burton v. Spiers, 87-87.
Sec. 512. Assessors to set apart personal property, and
return the same to register of deeds. 1868-'U, c. 137, s. 8
Said assessors shall set apart of the personal property of
said applicant, to be by him selected, articles of personalty
to which he may be entitled under this chapter, not exceed
ing in value the sum of five hundred dollars, and make
and sign a descriptive list thereof, and return the same to
the register of deeds.
Honey invested in land. —Money or other personal property invested in
the purchase of land is thereby converted iuto realty, and the owner is
not entitled to have it set apart to him as "personal property exemp
tion." Dortch v. Benton, 98-190.
In partnership property.— A member of a partnership has a right to
require partnership effects to be first applied to the satisfaction of the
partnership indebtedness. One partner is not entitled to have his per
sonal property exemption allotted from the partnership effects without
the assent of his co-partners. Burns v. Harris, 67-140; Scott v. Kenan,
94-296; Stout v. McNeill, 98-1.
Such consent does not constitute a contract between the partners, and
it may be withdrawn at any time before the allotment is made. Stout
v. McNeill, 98-1.
See \ 507, ante, and cases there cited.
Sec. 513. Register to indorse on return the date, and regis
ter the same. 18G8-'9, c. 137, s. 9.
It shall be the duty of the register of deeds to indorse on
each of said returns the date when received for registration,
and to cause the same to be registered without unnecessary
delay. The said register shall receive for registering the
said returns the same fees that may be allowed him by ldw
for other similar or equivalent services, which fees shall be
paid by said resident applicant, his agent or attorney, upon
the reception of said returns by the register.
Second allotment after registration of the first.—Where a homestead has
been allotted, the return of appraisers registered, and time for filing
objection passed, a second allotment, though under a judgment docketed
since the first allotment, will be treated as void. Thornton v. Van Story,
107-331Sec. 514. When persons die, homestead not set apart, who
may have the same set apart. 1868-'9, c. 137, s. 10.
If any person entitled to a homestead exemption, die
without having had the same set apart, his widow, if he
leave no children, or his child or children under the age of
twenty-one years, if he leave such, may proceed to have
said homestead exemption laid off according to sections five
hundred and eleven and five hundred and twelve.
Sights the same as if homestead had been laid off in life-time. —The widow
and children have only the same rights of homestead as if the husband
and father had not neglected to have his homestead laid off during his
life-time. Gregory v. Ellis, 86-579; McAfee v. Bettis, 72-28.
Duty of administrator selling land to make assets. —Where an administra
tor sells land by order of court to pay debts of his intestate, he must lay
off a homestead for the parties entitled thereto, and his failure to do so
cannot deprive them of the homestead. Allen v. Shields, 72-504.
Bights of widow.— If there are no debts, widow cannot have homestead
laid off to her. Hager v. Nixon, 69-108: Watts v. Leggett, 66-197.
A widow is not entitled to a homestead in the lands of her husband if
he die leaving children—minors or adults. Wharton v. Leggett, 80-169;
Hager v. Nixon, 69-108; Saylor v. Powell, 90-202.
A widow who has no homestead of her own, is entitled to have one
allotted to her out of the lands of her deceased husband, even although
homestead was allotted to him during his life, but it is otherwise as to
personal property exemption, which expires at the death of the husband.
Smith v. McDonald, 95-163.
A widow who has a homestead allotted her in the land of her deceased
husband in lieu of a dower is tenant for life thereof, within the purview
of the statute, which provides that " a person seized * * * as tenant
for life," who shall not, within one year after sale for taxes, redeem
the lands sold, shall forfeit to the person next in title his or her right of
the premises. Tucker v. Tucker, 108-235.
Sights of children. —Upon the death of a man seized in fee of land, leav
ing a widow and minor children, without having had his homestead laid
off, the double rights of dower and homestead do not attach together
simul et semel, either in the widow or widow and children, but dower
haying been assigned to the widow, the children are only entitled to a
homestead sub modo, i. e., to a present interest, the enjoyment of which
is postponed till the death of the dowress. Watts v. Leggett, 66-197;
Graves v. Hines, 108-262.
Minors are entitled to have the homestead set apart to them if not
allotted during the father's life-time, but not the personal property
exemption. Welch and Macy, 7)3-240; Johnson v. Cross, 66-167.
The right to homestead is given to the minor children of an insolvent
father, regardless of their pecuniary circumstances. Allen v. Shields,
72-504.

If debtor remove from the state.—The wife and children only succeed to
the homestead in the event of the death of the father or husband.
They are not entitled to it after his removal from the state, though they
may remain. Finley v. Saunders, 98-462.

laid off to a husband in his life-time, or to his widow (there being no
children), after his death, cannot be divested in favor of the heir by the
release or extinguishment of the deceased husband's debts. Tucker v.
Tucker, 103-170.

made. 1868-'9, c. 137, s. 11.
When any person entitled to a homestead and personal
property exemption shall file his or her petition before a
justice of the peace, to have the same laid off and set apart

homestead for all costs and damages in a civil action.
Misdemeanor. —An officer who levies upon the personal property of the
defendant in the execution, and refuses to lay off to such defendant
upon demand, his personal property exemption, is guilty of a misde
meanor. State v. Carr, 71-106.
Amercement. —The provisions of the exemption laws so modify chap.
106, 'i 15, Battle's Revisul, as not to authorize the infliction of the pen
alty therein imposed (an amercement of $100) for failure to have in court
the amount of an execution issued upon a judgment for a debt con
tracted prior to 1868, when the judgment debtor has no property, real
or personal, in excess of the exemptions allowed by the constitution
of 186S; and this is so notwithstanding such exemptions are not valid
against executions for such debts. Richardson v. Wicker, 80-172.
Damages. —The sale under execution without laying off homestead,
being void, the debtor can maintain a suit upon the sheriff's bond only
for costs and damages sustained—not for the value of the homestead.
McCracken v. Adler, 98-400.
Breach of bond. —An unlawful sale by a sheriff of property exempt
from execution, is a breach of his official bond. Hobbs v. Barefoot,
104-224.

without assigning it, the sale is void. Arnold v. Estes, 92-162; McCracken
v. Adler, 98-400.

bounds, or make, or procure to be made, a false and fraudu
lent return thereof, shall be liable to indictment for a mis
demeanor, and shall be answerable to the judgment credi
tor for all costs and damages in a civil action.
j
Sale may be set aside. —It is the duty of a sheriff to lay off the home
stead of the defendant in the execution, and to sell the excess in a pru
dent and just manner, so as to realize a fair price. Where a sheriff
sells, at the instance of the defendant, several parcels of land en masse
and subject to the lien of the homestead, such sale is fraudulent, and
may be avoided by a creditor of such defendant, not present, nor con
senting to the sale. Andrews v. Pritchett, 72-135.
Sec. 518. Liability of officer, appraiser or assessor conspir
ing with creditor. 1808-9, c. 137, s. 19.

ment debtor or other person entitled to homestead and per
sonal property exemption, shall be dissatisfied with the
valuation and allotment of the appraisers or assessors (as
the case may be), he, within ten days thereafter, or any
other creditor within six months, and before sale under
execution of the excess, may notify the adverse party and
the sheriff having the execution in hand, and file with the
clerk of the superior court of the county where the said
allotment shall be made a transcript of the return of the
appraisers or assessors (as the case may be), which they or
the sheriff shall allow to be made upon demand, together
with his objections, in writing, to said return; and there
upon the said clerk shall" put the same on the civil issue
docket of said superior court for trial, at the next term
thereof, as other civil actions, and such issue joined shall
have precedence over all other issues at such term; and the
sheriff shall not sell the excess until after the determina
tion of said action.
Amendment {acts 1885, ch. J4J).
When an increase of the exemption, or an allotment in
property other than that set apart, shall be demanded, the
party objecting shall, in his objections, specify the property
from which the increase or re-allotment is to be had. If

assess the value of the property embraced therein; if in
creased, the value of the property specified in the objec
tions from which the increase is demanded, shall also be
assessed; but if the allotment shall be made in property
other than that first set apart, the jury shall assess the value
of the property so allotted. The court shall appoint three
disinterested commissioners to lay off and set apart the
homestead and personal property exemption in accordance
with the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court,
and in the manner prescribed by law. The commissioners,
who shall be summoned by the sheriff, shall meet upon the
premises, and, after being sworn by the sheriff or a justice
of the peace to faithfully perform the duties of appraisers
(or assessors, as the case may be) in allotting and laying
off the homestead or personal property exemption, or both,
as the case may be, in accordance with the verdict and judg
ment aforesaid, allot [and] lay off the same and file their
report to the next term of the court, when the same shall
be heard by the court, upon exceptions thereto.
Amendment {acts 1887, ch. 272, s. 2).
Provided, that the ten (10) days and six months respec
tively shall begin to run from the date of the filing of the
return of the valuation and allotment of the appraisers or
assessors by the officer with the clerk of the superior court
of the county from whence the execution issues as pro
vided in section five hundered and four (504).
If no exception made nor appeal. —If an allotment of homestead under
execution is made without exception or appeal by the judgment credi
tor it is an estoppel of record against him. Spoon v. Reid, 78-244.
Objection must be made before sale of excess. —The application for a
re-assessment of a homestead by the township board of trustees must be
made before the sale of the excess by the sheriff. Heptinstall v. Perry,
76-190.
This section exclusive. — An allotment of the homestead or personal
property exemption cannot be attacked collaterally by the judgment
debtor, or anyone claiming under him. If he is dissatisfied therewith,
he must present his objections in the manner prescribed by the statute.
Welch v. Welch, 101-565.
Service of exceptions. — Notice of dissatisfaction with allotment of
personal property exemption, under this section, cannot be served by
mail or given orally, but proof of service must be made as required by
\ 228 of The Code. Allen v. Strickland, 100-225.
Must be filed in clerk's office.—Exceptions to the allotment of a home
stead or personal property exemptions, in all cases, must be filed in the
office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the allot
ment is made, together with a transcript of the allotment or appraise
ment. McAuley v. Morris, 101-369.
Exceptions only to valuation and allotment.—The homestead of a person,
agaiust whom there is a docketed judgment and several subsequent mort
gages of record, and a bond for title covering the homestead allotment,
and the excess above it levied on, was allotted to him by appraisers, and
exceptions thereto were filed. There were no exceptions that raised the
question of the value of the homestead whether or not it was worth
more than $ 1,000: Held, (1) there was 110 issue presented which it was
the duty of the court to pass upon iu this proceeding; (2) the equities
between the parties having liens on the lands cannot be passed upon in
an appeal from the appraisers. Their duties extend no further than the
valuation and allotment of the homestead. Aiken v. Gardner, J07-236.
Right to jury trial.—Where the debtor designated the particular land
which he desires to have allotted him as "an increase of exemption"
(under ch. 347, laws 1885), and the creditors assent thereto, neither party
can demand that the property shall be valued by a jury. Beavans v.
Goodrich, 98-217.
Exceptions too late. — A homestead was laid off to a judgment debtor,
with which he was dissatisfied, after the repeal of the act allowing an
appeal to the township board of trustees. He might, however, have
had the action of the appraisers reviewed by a recordari or by a motion
in the cause, which he did not do. After the enactment of \ 519 of The
Code, the homesteader attempted to have the action of the appraisers
reviewed under the provisions of that section: It was held, that he had
lost his remedy by the failure to ir.ove in the manner allowed by law,
before the sale of the excess. Hartman v. Spiers, 94-150.
Sec. 620. When exemption matte or allotted on petition;
objection thereto, how to be made.
When the homestead or personal property exemption is
made or allotted on the petition of the person entitled thereto,
any creditor may, within six months from the time of said
assessment or appraisal, and upon ten days' notice to the
petitioner, file his objections with the register of deeds of
the county in which the premises are situated, and the
register of deeds shall return the same to the clerk of the
superior court of said county, who shall place the same on
the civil issue docket, and the same shall be tried as provided
in the preceding section for homestead and personal prop
erty exemptions set off under execution.
When first allotment not excepted to. —No valid issue as to the value of
the homestead at the time of the second allotment can be raised by
exceptions of creditors thereto, because the first allotment is final.
Thornton v. Van Story, 107-331; Gulley v. Cole, 96-447; Ibid., 102-333.
Sec. 5'il. Costs of re-assessment, how paid.
If the superior court at term shall confirm the appraisal
or assessment, or shall increase the exemption allowed the
debtor or claimant, the levy shall stand only upon the
excess remaining, and the creditor shall pay all the costs
of the proceeding in court. If the amount allowed the
debtor or claimant shall be reduced, the costs of the pro
ceeding in court shall be paid by the debtor or claimant,
and the levy shall cover the excess then remaining.
Must await final judgment. —The cost of this proceeding (under $ 519)
must await the final judgment. Beavans v. Goodrich, 98-217.
Sec. 522. Undertaking of objector.
The creditor, debtor or claimant objecting to the allot
ment made by the appraisers or assessors (as the case may
be) under execution or petition, shall file with the clerk of
the superior court an undertaking in the sum of one hun
dred dollars for the payment to the adverse party of such
costs as shall be adjudged against him.
Sec. 023. Appraisal or assessment may be set aside, for
what.
Any appraisal or allotment by appraisers or assessors
hereinbefore provided may be set aside for fraud, complicity
or other irregularity; but whenever any allotment or assess
ment shall be made or confirmed by the superior court at
term time, as hereinbefore provided, the said homestead
shall not thereafter be set aside or again laid off by any
other creditor.
Not sufficient ground. —An allotment of a homestead will not be set aside
because it might have been assigned in a manner more convenient to the
homesteader. Ray v. Thornton, 95-571.
The omission of appraisers to insert in their report the date of allot
ment is not sufficient ground for vacating it. Beavans v. Goodrich,
98-217.
Sec. 524. Return to be registered—forms.
When the homestead and personal property exemption
shall be decided by the court at term time, the clerk of the
superior court shall immediately file with the register of
deeds of the county a copy of the same, which copy shall
be registered as deeds are now registered by law; and, in
all judicial proceedings, the original or a certified copy of
said return may be introduced in evidence.
The following forms shall be substantially followed in
proceedings under this chapter:
i. when" the homestead is valued at less than one
thousand dollars, and personal property also

the issue of title is found for the plaintiff, but the jury find that no tres
pass was committed, the defendant recovers costs. Murray v. Spencer,
92-264.
Defendant successful on an equitable defence.—One who successfully main
tains an equitable defence against the recovery of land on the bare legal
title is entitled to judgment for his costs. This rule is not varied by
ch. 139, acts i87o-'i, which merely prescribes a schedule of fees, and not
which of the litigants shall pay them. Vestal v. Sloan, 83-555; Currie
v. Clark, 101-321.
Unsuccessful attempt to enforce judgment. —Where plaintiff fails in an
attempt to enforce his judgment, the defendant will recover the costs of
the proceeding. Norris v. Luther, 101-196.
In actions against vendee. —A vendee is not entitled to recover costs in
an action to force him to perform his contract and pay for the land, if
he contests the case and does not make a deposit of the amount due,
although the plaintiff cannot make a good title at the time when the
action is commenced. // is intimated, that the vendee could recover his
costs in such case, if he made a deposit of the balance due, and accepted
the title as soon as the vendor had perfected it. Hobson v. Buchanan.
Former practice. —Under the former practice, a judgment for costs could
not be rendered against one to whose use a suit was brought. Lea v.
Brooks, 49-423.
Consolidation of cases.—It is error to consolidate cases which are essen
tially different, and where the parties are not the same in each. Cases
in which consolidation may be ordered stated by Smith, C J. Hartman
v. Spiers, 87-28.
Defendant in forma pauperis. —One who is allowed to defend in an action
to recover real estate without giving bond (The Code, \ 237), is not
relieved from paying costs, and may recover costs. Justice v. Eddings,
75-581; Lambert v. Kinnery, 74-348; Dempsey v. Rhodes, 93-120.
Sec. 527. When allowed to either party in the discretion of
the court. C. C. P., s. 278.
In other actions, costs may be allowed or not, in the dis
cretion of the court. In all actions where there are several
defendants not united in interest, and making separate
defences by separate answers, and the plaintiff fails to recover
judgment against all, the court may award costs to such of
the defendants as have judgment in their favor, or any of
them. In the following cases the costs of an appeal to any
court shall be in the discretion of the court :
(1) When a new trial shall be ordered;
(2) When a judgment shall be affirmed in part, and
reversed in part.
Reduced judgment on appeal. — Where a party appeals from a judgment
rendered against him, and a reduced judgment is rendered against him
in the appellate court, he must be adjudged still to pay all the costs.
They cannot be divided. Costs follow the verdict and judgmentf of
course. Railroad v. Phillips, 78-49.
Discretionary power as to costs exercised. —Where there was error in the
ruling below, but the judge acted in conformity with a military order
then in force, each party will pay his own costs in the appeal. Mitchell
v. Henderson, 63-643.
Ordinarily, the successful party is entitled to the costs of the appeal,
but where it is a board of county commissioners, who, throughout the
proceedings, have evinced little desire to discharge their duty, and have
caused a delay of justice, no costs will be allowed them. Sedberry v.
Com'rs, 66-486.
When a new trial is ordered, costs are in the discretion of the court,
but it would be unreasonable to charge a plaintiff who has submitted to
a nonsuit in deference to the erroneous opinion of the judge, with any
portion of the costs necessarily incurred in its correction. Jones v.
Mial, 85-507.
The costs in an action to annul a sale of land and set up an equitable title
are discretionary with the court, under this section, and each party is
ordered to pay his own, and each to pay one-half of the allowance to
the referee. Gully v. Macey, 89-343.
In actions for specific performance.—In an action for specific performance,
and in other actions of an equitable nature, the costs are in the discre
tion of the C-urt, and the exercise of the discretion is not reviewable.
Parton v. Boyd, 104-422; Gully v. Macey, 89-343.
In actions for settlement of acconnts of executors and administrators. — In an
action for the settlement of accounts of executors and administrators,
where there are separate answers and defences, and the interests of the
defendants are conflicting, the adjustment of the costs is in the discre
tion of the court below, and its judgment will not be disturbed in the
supreme court. Smith v. Smith, 101-461.
In contempt proceedings. —Semble, that costs are in discretion of the
court. Kron v. Smith, 96-386.
Case remanded by the supreme court, costs. —Where a case is remanded by
the supreme court because the record is imperfect, each party will pay
his own costs. Bradley v. Jones, 76-294; Gordon v. Sanderson, 83-1.
See 'i'i 533 and 566, post, and cases cited.
Sec. BUS. What cost* allowed. C. C. P., s. 279.
To either party for whom judgment shall be given there
shall be allowed as costs his actual disbursements for fees
to the officers, witnesses, and other persons entitled to
receive the same.
Mortgagee. —A mortgagor applied for an injunction to restrain the mort
gagee from selling under "the mortgage, alleging that the debt secured
was usurious, and that he was entitled to sundry credits. The mort
gagee denied the usury, but the issue on that plea was found against
him: Held, that defendant was entitled to judgment for the amount
actually due on the mortgage debt, with interest, and under this section
(528) for costs. Cook v. Patterson, 103-127.
Counsel fees. — A commissioner appointed to make sale of land under a
decree of court, will not be allowed any extra compensation "for his
attorney's fees, where it appears that his duties are simple, and it is not
made to appear that the services of counsel are necessary. Gay v.
Davis, 107-269.
Nor will the court make an allowance for counsel fees. Mordecai v.
Devereux, 74-673.
An administrator is not entitled to be allowed counsel fees for defend
ing an action by next of kin to compel him to final settlement, when he
unreasonably, w-ilfully and dishonestly delays to account with them.
Allen v. Royster, 107-278.
Witnesses. —The manner of summoning witnesses, and their compen
sation, is entirely regulated by statute. There is no provision in our law
authorizing the taxation as costs, of the fees for attendance and mileage
of witnesses who have not been summoned, nor of witnesses who have
been summoned, but who are non-residents; Stern v. Herren, 101-516;
nor against losing party, if not tendered. Loftin v. Baxter, 66-340.
While not more than two witnesses to a single point may be taxed
against the losing; party in a civil action, the liability of the party, who
summoned them, for their compensation, is not abridged. State v. Massey, 104-877.
Judgment for costs at chambers. —Whether a judge can grant a judgment
taxing a county with the payment of costs, at chambers and in vacation,
Quare. State v. Ray, 97-510.
Motion to retax. —When a motion to retax a bill of costs is made at the
next term after judgment is entered, it is error for the judge to hold
that he has no power to entertain it. Semble, the motion could be made
any time within one year after judgment. In re Smith, 105-167.
Reference fees. —See \ 533, post, aud cases cited.
Sec. 52U. 1nterest, when allowed. C. C. P., s. 282.
When the judgment is for the recovery of money, interest
from the time of the verdict or report until judgment be
finally entered shall be computed by the clerk and added
to the costs of the party entitled thereto.
Interest after verdict. —Although the allowance for interest, in an action
for damages for conversion of property, is discretionary with the jury,
yet, after the verdict, the judgment for the damages assessed bears inter
est, and this is so, although the verdict is for a certain sum "without
interest." Stephens v. Koouce, 103-266.
Sec. 530. 1nterest on contracts, except penal bonds, and on
all judgments ; jury to distinguish principal from inter
est. B. f\, c. 31, s. 90. 1780, c. 253, s. 1. 1789, c. 314,
s. 4. 1807, c 721.
All sums of money due by contract, of any kind what
soever, excepting money due on penal bonds shall bear
interest, and, when a jury shall render a verdict therefor,
they shall distinguish the principal from the sum allowed
as interest; and the principal sum due on all such contracts
shall bear interest from the time of rendering judgment
thereon until it be paid and satisfied. In like manner, the
amount of any judgment or decree, except the costs, ren
dered or adjudged in any kind of action, though not on
contract, shall bear interest till paid, and the judgment
and decree of the court shall be rendered according to this
section.
Interest from date of judgment. —A judgment in favor of a widow against
the personal representative for the deficiency in her "year's support"
bears interest. Long v. Long, 85-415.
Where a definite sum is ascertained and decreed to be paid to a dis
tributee on a settlement of an estate, the amount draws interest from
the date of such decree without a demand. McRae v. Malloy, 87-196.
Interest from the demand. —A tenant in common, in an action by his
co-tenants for an account of the rents and profits, is chargeable with
interest from the demand. Jolly v. Bryan, 86-457.
Interest will run against an agent who has received money for his
principal, and fails to pay it over, from demand. Porter v. Grimsley,
98-550.
When interest and principal should be discriminated. —The design of the
law is to allow interest on the principal sum from the date of the judg
ment, where principal and interest are discriminated on the record, or it
can be collected from an inspection of it what the principal is, interest
should be calculated on that; but where the whole sum is assessed in
damages, the jury must discriminate between principal and interest.
Deloach v. York, 10-36.
Semble. —Where it appears that the payments have more than dis
charged the interest, the judgment need not distinguish principal and
iuterist. Hall v. Craige, 68-305.
In an action of claim and delivery. —Interest is not allowable, as a matter
of law, in an action of claim and delivery, but the jury may, in their
discretion, and as damages, allow interest on the value of the property
from the time it was taken. Patapsco v. Magee, 86-350.
Allowance of interest not discretionary, when. —A judge has no right, in
an action for debt, to leave it to the jury to give the plaintiff interest, or
not, as they should think proper, but should instruct them that if they
find that the defendant owes the principal money demanded, the plaintiff
is entitled to interest from the time it was due. Barlow v. Norfleet,
72-535Where the jury finds that the defendant owes the sum demanded, it is
not necessary for the jury to give interest. The law gives it, and the
court is authorized to enter up judgment for the same, with interest
thereon from the day it became due. Farmer v. Willard, 75-401.
Any sum of money due by contract (except penal bonds) bears interest.
Brem v. Covington, 104-589.
In action against clerk. —In an action to recover from the clerk and his
sureties moneys received by him in his official capacity, the plaintiff is
entitled to interest at six per cent, per annum from the time of its receipt
by the officer, and to twelve per cent, from the time of demand and
refusal to pay. Presson v. Boone, 108-78; State v. Allen, 27-36.
In action for waste.—The jury could not allow damages for prospective
waste, but damage can be assessed only up to the time of trial. If the
life-tenant should allow the inheritance to sustain further injury after
the time of trial, damage may be recovered in another action. Sherrill
v. Connor, 107-630.
On penal bond. —Where there is a penal bond for the payment of money,
interest may be recovered upon the sum really due up to the time of
payment, even after judgment. Trice v. Turreutine, 35-212.
On penalty.—The penalty of £2,500 imposed upon sheriffs and tax-col
lectors for failure to settle with the county treasurer does not bear inter
est until after judgment. Davenport v. McKee, 98-500.
Where nsurions interest was not excepted to. —When there were executed
by defendants independent collateral covenants intended to secure the
plaintiff for the balance found to be due for advancements made by
plaintiff to them, and it appeared that, upon such advancements and
before the balance had been asr/ertaincd, plaintiff charged them usif
rious interest, to which no exception was made at the time of the
referee's report and the court's confirmation thereof: Held, that the
judgment of the court that the plaintiff recover no interest on balance
found to be due was error. Bank v. Bobbitt, 108-525.
See Battle's Digest, vol. 1, 787-789; vol. 4, 272-273.
Sec. 531. In judgments final by default, interest ascer
tained by clerk. R. C, c. 31, s. 91. 171t7, c. 475, s. 1.
Whenever a suit shall be instituted on a single bond, a
covenant for the payment of money, bill of exchange,
promissory note, or a signed account, and the defendant
shall not plead to issue thereon, upon judgment, the clerk
of the court shall ascertain the interest due by law, with
out a writ of inquiry, and the amount shall be included in
the final judgment of the court as damages, which judg
ment shall be rendered therein in the manner prescribed by
the preceding section.
Clerk computes the interest. —In judgments by default final, the clerk
computes the interest. Rogers v. Moore, 86-85.
Error in computation corrected.—Where, upon a judgment by default
final upon a specialty, the clerk of the court makes an error in the cal
culation of interest, the court can correct the mistake at anytime, upon
motion. Griffin v. Hinson, 51-154.
Default final, regular. —Where the action is for a sum certain which the
defendant had promised to pay for goods sold and delivered, and the
complaint is sworn to, a judgment by default final can be taken where
a frivolous demurrer is filed. Adrian v. Jackson, 75-536.
Default final, irregular. —Where an action is brought upon an unliqui
dated account, and judgment is given against the defendant, who
appeals, it is error upon a default in the appellate court to give judg
ment final for the sum recovered below, without an inquiry if damages.
Hartsfield v. Jones, 49-309.
In an action sounding in damages for an unliquidated money demand,
a judgment by default final is irregular; and, on motion, will be set
aside. Moore v. Mitchell, 61-304.
See \\ 385 and 388, ante, and cases cited.
Default aud inquiry. —A judgment by default in an action for goods sold
and delivered, is an admission of a cause of action, and entitles the
plaintiff to nominal damages, but it does not relieve the plaintiff from
the necessity of proving the delivery and value of the articles, nor
estop the defendant from disproving the delivery. Parker v. Smith,
64-291.
See H 386 and 388, ante, and cases cited.

of the allowances for cost, as provided in this Code, the
necessary disbursements, including the fees of officers
allowed by law, the fees of witnesses, the reasonable com
pensation of commissioners in taking depositions, the fees
of referees. The disbursements shall be stated in detail.
Whenever it shall be necessary to adjust costs in any inter
locutory proceedings, or in any special proceedings, the
same shall be adjusted by the clerk of the court to which
the proceedings were returned, except in those matters in
which the allowance is required and to be made by the
judge.
Taxed by clerk. —The costs are taxed by the clerk. Hewlett v. Nutt,
79-263.
Supervised by the court. —The taxation of costs by the clerk is subject to
the supervision of the court. Where a party is apprehensive that the
clerk will err in the taxation of costs, he should move the court for
special directions to the officer as to taxing the costs. Wooley v. Rob
inson, 52-30.
Failure to adjudicate as to costs.—A failure to adjudicate upon the ques
tion of costs does not affect the character of a decree as a final one.
Peterson v. Vann, 83-118.
Apportionment.—The apportionment of the costs among the several
defendants (or plaintiffs) liable for them is a matter of discretion in the
judge below. Wharton v. Gattis, 91-53.
Sec. 533. Referee's fees. C. C. P., s. 285. 1880, c. 37.
The fees of a referee shall be fixed by the court or judge,

party, or apportioned among the parties in such manner as
to the court shall seem consonant to right and justice.
Taxed against losing party. —The referee's fees are a part of the costs,
and, like all other costs, must be taxed against the losing party. Wall
v. Covington, 76-150; Swain v. McCullock, 75-495; Arlington v. Good
rich, 95-462.
Where the reference is made upon the demand of one defendant the
admission of the allegations of the complaint by another defendant will
not relieve the latter from liability for the costs of a reference. Whar
ton v. Gattis, 91-53.
Where there is a fund in court, which is afterwards adjudged to belong
to the plaintiff, and pending the controversy an order is made allowing
a reference fee in the cause, which is paid out of the fund, and the final
judgment is against the defendant for all of the costs, this sum so paid,
is properly taxed in the costs, and must be paid by the defendant. White
v. Jones, 94-41 1.
Note. —The last paragraph of this section, which places the taxation
of referee's . fees in the discretion of the court, was added 1889, ch. 37.
The above decisions were all made prior to that amendment.
Sec, also, \ 535, (2) post, as to different rule as to reference on claims
against a deceased person.
Sum allowed.—The sum allowed referee is in the discretion of the court,
and not subject to review. Worthy v. Brower, 93-492.
Sec. 534. Coats against infant plaintiff. C. C P., s. 280.
When costs are adjudged against an infant plaintiff, the
guardian by whom he appeared in the action shall be
responsible therefor.
Next friends. —But "next friends," unlike the guardian, are not really
parties to an action. Mason v. McCormick, 75-263; George v. High,
85-113; Tate v. Mott, 96-19.

ciously procured himself appointed, or has been guilty of mismanage
ment or bad faith. Smith v. Smith, 108-365.
Sec. 535. Costs in action by or against an executor or ad
ministrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person
expressly authorized by statute to sue. C. C. P., s. 287.
(1) In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor,
administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person
expressly. authorized by statute, costs shall be recovered as
in action by and against a person prosecuting or defending
in his own right ; but such costs shall be chargeable only
upon or collected out of the estate, fund or party represented,
unless the court shall direct the same to be paid by the
plaintiff or defendant, personally, for mismanagement or
bad faith in such action or defence.
Former practice. —Where the plea of "fully administered" was found
for the defendant and a judgment quando (under the old system) ren
dered for the plaintiff, the defendant was entitled to judgment against
the plaintiff individually for costs. Lewis v. Johnston, 67-38; Lewis v.
Johnston, 69-392; Welborn v. Gordon, 5-502: Battle v. Rorke, 12-228;
Terry v. Vest, 33-65.
Note.—These decisions are based upon the practice before the adoption of the above section.
Trustee, etc., not taxable personally unless guilty of mismanagement or bad
faith. —A trustee cannot be taxed personally with costs unless the court
adjudges that he has been guilty of mismanagement or bad faith in the
action or defence. Smith v. King, 107-273.
In proceedings to sell lands to make assets, the realty is liable for
costs as well as for the balance of the judgment, unless the court which
rendered the judgment taxed the cost against the executor (or adminis
trator) personally, or against the plaintiff. Long v. Oxford, 108-280.
While the "next friend" is not, strictly speaking, a party to the
action, and generally will not be taxed with costs, yet where the court
finds the fact that he officiously procured his appointment, or was guilty
of mismanagement or bad faith, it may tax }iiw with costs. Smith v.
Smith, 108-365.
Counsel fees, etc., out of fund. —A trustee as against those for whose bene
fit the fund is created will be allowed payment put of the fund for such
costs and expenses, including counsel fees, as may be necessary to pro
tect it, but he will not be allowed such disbursements against one who
establishes an adversary title to the property. Chemical Co. v. Johnsou, 101-223.
(2) And whenever any claim against a deceased person
shall be referred, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover the fees of referees and witnesses, and other neces
sary disbursements, to be taxed according to law.
But not unless defendant refuse to refer under <s 1426, or unreasonably delayed
payment. The Code, \ 1429. —When payment is not unreasonably delayed
or neglected by the administrator or executor, and he has not refused
to refer the matter in controversy, pursuant to The Code, 'i 1426, nocosts
will be awarded against him. The Code, j! 1429; Morris v. Morris, 94-613.
Eleven years' resistance of a just claim is such unreasonable delay.

Does not apply, when. —This section does not apply to an assignment of

of the supreme court. Howerton v. Henderson, 86-718.
When an action is tried so short a time before a term of the supreme
court that the appeal cannot be docketed, after giving the statutory time
for perfecting an appeal, before the close of the call of the district to
which it belongs, it may be docketed at the next term. Gregory v.
Hobbs, 92-39, construed and approved; Pritchard v. Avery, 106-344.
Practice as to docketing appealB summarized.—Practice as to docketing
appeals summarized and fully stated. Porter v. Railroad, 106-478. See
Rule 5 of the Supreme Court, post.
Substitute for writ of error Appeals are by this section substituted for
writs of error. Lynn v. Lowe, 88-478.
Sec. 545. Writs of certiorari, rccordari and supersedeas.
1874->5, c. 109.
Writs of certiorari, recordari'and supersedeas are hereby
authorized as heretofore in use
The writs of certiorari and
rccordari, when used as substitutes for an appeal, may issue
when ordered upon the applicant filing a written under
taking for the costs only; but the supersedeas, to suspend
execution, shall not issue until an undertaking is filed, or
a deposit made to secure the judgment sought to be vacated,
as in cases of appeal where the execution is stayed.
Certiorari will lie as a substitute for an appeal. —Where the party swears
that a judgment by default was taken at the appearance term against
him, that he was prevented from attending by a violent attack of illness,
that his application to set aside the judgment made at the term was
refused, and that he has a meritorious defence to the action, a certiorari
will be granted. Dyer v. Rich, 4-610.
Where the appellant is defeated of his appeal by the negligence or
omission of the clerk, by the action of the judge, or of the adverse party,
he is entitled to a certiorari. Mora v. Scales, 9-364; Murray v. Shanklin,
20-276; Reade v. Hamlin, 61-128; Skinner v. Maxwell, 67-257.
Where a party is deprived by the fraud or contrivance of the adverse
party, either of his opportunity to defend or of appealing, certiorari lies.
Bledsoe v. Snow, 48-99; Lunceford v. McPherson, 48-174.
Where the person really interested in a suit in equity is a feme covert,
and her husband, who had joined in the suit, was absent at the trial upon
representation of counsel, who assured him that his presence was not
necessary, and the counsel failed to procure surety for the appeal, aud
there are merits in the case, a certiorari will lie. McLeran v. Jones,
56-195Where an appeal is prayed, but the appellant is prevented by illness
from perfecting it in time, a certiorari lies. Sharpe v. McElwee, 53-115.
Where a party is defeated of his appeal by the neglect, omission or
delay of the clerk, or by the contrivance of the opposite pariy, or by the
improper conduct of the court, he is entitled to a certiorari. Chambers
v. Smith, 2-366; Baker v. Halstead, 44-41; McConnell v. Caldwell, 51469; Steele v. Harris, 4-636; Brooks v. Morgan, 27-481. And this with
out reference to merits. Collins v. Nail, 14-224.
If a party is deprived of an appeal without his laches, he is entitled to
a certiorari as a substitute for an appeal. Skinner v. Maxwell, 67-257.
Though an appeal may be brought up in spite of the prohibition of a
judge, yet, as the practice has been so uniformly the other way, the
court would not feel at liberty to refuse a party a certiorari, as a substi
tute for the remedy of which he had been deprived. Ibid.
Where there is an oral agreement, not denied, to waive Code time, a
certiorari lies. Walton v. Pearson, 82-464.
Lies where a party is deprived of his appeal by the declarations or
conduct of the adverse party. Walton v. Pearson, 83-309; Briggs v.
Pearson, 98-454.
Lies where the appeal is lost by appellee's failure to have the judg
ment properly prepared and entered. Syme v. Broughton, 84-114.
Lies where appeal is lost by appellee's consenting to extend time, and
delay is caused by appellee's negligence. Parker v. Railroad, 84-118;
Collins v. Faribault, 94-310; Mott v. Ramsay, 91-249.
Lies where the appeal was not docketed in time at the next ensuing
term of the supreme court by reason of the unexpected illness of the
clerk of the superior court; Howerton v. Henderson, 86-718; or in con
sequence of illness of his counsel. Mott v. Ramsay, 90-372.
Lies where the erroneous ruling of the judge, that time could be given
to perfect an appeal in forma pauperis, prevented the appellant from
immediately proceeding to perfect his appeal. Stell v. Barham, 86-727.
Lies where the conversation and correspondence between the parties
as to extending the time to perfect the appeal, reasonably had the effect
of misleading the appellant, and there is no material conflict in the
statements contained in the affidavits filed by both parties. Parker v.
Railroad, 87-1 IS.
Certiorari will be granted where the applicant has been deprived of
his appeal by no laches on his part, but by the conduct of the appellee.
Wiley v. Lineberry, 88-68.
An appellant is not entitled to a new trial or mandamus commanding
the judge to send up a correct statement of the case upon an affidavit that
the case as settled by the judge does not correctly set forth the grounds
of exemption He may apply for a certiorari. McDaniel v. King, 89-29.
A certiorari will be granted where the party is in no default, but has
been diligent in his efforts to take an appeal. It is sufficient, as in this
case, for a party intending to appeal to seek information of the clerk of
the court as to the time of filing the judgment to be appealed from—the
paper in the case having been sent to the judge and returned after
the expiration of the term. In such case it must appear that there is
reasonable ground for the appeal that was lost; not that the cause there
for would avail the party in this court. The right to the writ of certio
rari here is not affected by reason of the denial of the petitioner's motion
for an injunction against collecting the judgment—that motion being
made in a separate and distinct action from the one in which the peti
tioners desire to appeal. Roulhac v. Miller, 89-190.
An appellant is only entitled to a writ of certiorari as a substitute for
an appeal when he has lost his appeal by no neglect of his own or agent,
but by error or neglect of the court or its officers, or by contrivance of
the appellee or his agent, or by their acts or declarations reasonably cal
culated to mislead, or where, from some insurmountable obstacle, he is
prevented from perfecting his appeal. Winborne v. Byrd, 92-7; Com'rs
v. Steamship Co., 98-163.
Where the appellant serves his case on appeal in apt time and the
appellee files objections to it, and the appellant at once notifies the
judge, and asks him to fix a time and place to settle the case on appeal,
which the judge fails to do, a certiorari will be granted to bring up the
appeal. Sparks v. Sparks, 92-359; Hodges v. Lassiter, 94-294.
Where a party has lost his appeal by the conduct of his adversary,
his remedy is by the writ of certiorari, to bring the case to the appel
late court, and not by a motion for a new trial. State v. Bennett,
93-503.
Where it appears that the papers had been taken from the clerk's
office, to enable the trial judge to make up the statement of the case on
appeal, but had not been returned in time for the appellant to get the
transcript to this court in time, certiorari will be issued to bring up the
appeal. Seay v. Yarborough, 94-291.
But when a party is deprived of his right of appeal without his
laches, he is entitled to a certiorari as a substitute for an appeal; and
also when he has been misled by statements of the adverse party, and
there has been mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect;
but the appellant must show due diligence on his part. Graves v.
Hines, 106-323.
Becanse "case on appeal" not settled. — Where an appeal is taken, the
record should be sent up and the appeal docketed in proper time and
application made for a certiorari if the case is not settled, and there is
no laches oti the part of appellant. Owens v. Phelps, 91-253; Pitman
v. Kimberly, 92-562.
Where a certiorari is granted, because no case on appeal has been
prepared, the supreme court will limit the time within which the case
may be prepared and served by the appellant, and in case the parties
do not agree, it will be settled as directed by \ 550 of The Code. Sparks
v. Sparks, 92-359.
Where it appears from the return of the writ of certiorari that the
original record has been lost or destroyed, so that a transcript cannot
be made, the supreme court will not proceed until the record is restored
or substituted. Nicholl v. Dunning, 99-82.
The petitioner stated that he employed counsel, and was informed by
him that time was given to perfect his appeal, and 0n this account he
omitted to perfect it in time. The plaintiff appellee admitted that
petitioner "understood he was to have time to perfect the appeal":
Held, in such case, the writ of certiorari should be granted. Graves v.
Hines, 106-323.
Certiorari will lie to perfect the record. —When the transcript on appeal
filed in the supreme court is defective or imperfect, a certiorari may be
obtained. Smith v. Kelly, 7-507; and this, though it is suggested that
the record of the court below is in itself imperfect and must be amended.
State v. Craton, 28-164.
A certiorari will issue as often as it appears to the court that there is
reason to believe the trauscript imperfect, and until a correct one is
obtained. State v. Reid, 21-377; State v. Munroe, 30 258.
Where the waiver of time is admitted, and the controversy is as to the
manner of stating the case on appeal, a certiorari will be granted, that
the judge who tried the case may make out the statement of a "case
settled." Holmes v. Holmes, 84-833.
Omissions of material matter in the record of a trial will be supplied
by certiorari, and the superior court has the power to make such cor
rections as are necessary to make the record truthful. State v. Randall,
87-571; State v. Craton, 28-164.
When difficulty arises in procuring a statement of the case, the party
should file the record proper, and ask the aid of the court to perfect the
appeal, without delay. Wiley v. Lineberry, 88-68.
A new trial for failure to perfect the record will only be granted when
the appellant is in no laches, and only then when the transcript of the
record is filed and a certiorari moved for. Nichols v. Dunning, 91-4.
Certiorari to correct statement of case by the judge. — Does not lie to cor
rect alleged omissions of judge in "settling" the case. State v. Black
burn, 8o-474.
A certiorari to correct an omission or error in statement of case will
only issue when it clearly appears that there was mistake or inadvertence,
and that the judge will correct it. The court cannot require him to do
so, it can only give him an opportunity. Currie v. Clark, 90-17; Ware
v. Nisbet, 92-202; State v. Gooch, 94-982; State v. Gay, 94-821; Mayo v.
Leggett, 96-237; State v. Sloan, 97-499; McDaniel v. King, 89-29; Cheek
v. Watson, 90-302.
The application must not merely aver that the judge will probably
make the correction if given opportunity, but must set out the grounds
of such belief that the court may judge of its reasonableness. Porter
v. Railroad. 97-63; Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
A certiorari will be granted when it appears, by affidavit, that certain
material testimony produced on the trial below was omitted in the case
on appeal, and a communication from the judge who tried the case
states that such omission was by inadvertence. In such case, the certio
rari will be granted after the case has been argued in the supreme court,
if before it has been considered in conference. . Boyer v. Teague, 106-571.
If the assignments of error to charge are set out in appellant's case,
but are omitted in the case settled by the judge, a certiorari to incor
porate them will issue. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
Certiorari will lie in the nature of a writ of false judgment. —When an
appeal is not given by law a certiorari is the proper remedy. Thompson
v. Floyd, 47-313; Reardon v. Guy, 3-245; Perry v. Perry, 4-184; Mat
thews v. Matthews, 26-155; Stevens v. Smith, 30-38; State v. Marley.
30-48; State v. Herndon, 107-934.
Besides the ordinary office of supplying the place of an appeal, under
peculiar circumstances, the writs of certiorari and recordari may be
used as writs of error and false judgment respectively; in which cases
all that can be discussed is the error alleged to be apparent on the face
of the record. Hartsfield v. Jones, 49-309; Walton v. Gatlin, 60-318;
Biggs, ex parte, 64-202.
Where a matter involves the power of the superior court and error in
its exercise, as where, in a capital case, a judge improperly discharges a
jury and refuses to discharge the prisoner, the record may be brought
up for review by certiorari in the nature of a writ of error. The proper
rule is to ask for a rule to show cause why the writ should not issue, and
as foundation for the order the court will require a petition in due form.
State v. Jefferson, 66-309.
In a petition for a certiorari, as a writ of false judgment, it must be
affirmed or shown that a judgment was rendered; 1f the certiorari is
applied for as a substitute for an appeal, the party must show that he
has been improperly deprived of his appeal, or has lost it by accident.
Barton, ex parte, 70^134.
An appeal does not lie from a refusal to discharge a prisoner when a
mistrial is ordered. The remedy is to review the proceedings by a cer
tiorari. State v. Locke, 86-647.
Discussion as to when the writ will lie. —Discussion of the circumstances
when the writ will lie. Dougan v. Arnold, 15-99; Swain v. Fentress,
15-601.
Certiorari will not lie, as a substitute for appeal, when.—Ignorance of the
legal requirements in executing .or filing of an appeal bond, will not
entitle the party to a certiorari. Elliott v. Holliday, 14-377; Smith v.
Abrams, 90-21; Turner v. Powell, 93-341.
Certiorari will not lie unless a good cause is shown why an appeal was
not taken, or perfected. Rule v. Council, 48-33; McMillan v. Smith,
4-75; Collins v. Nail, 14-224; In re Brittain, 93-587.
If the appellant relies upon a third party to perfect his appeal, and
through forgetfulness such third party fails to do so in time, a certiorari
will not be granted. Davis v. Marshall, 9-59; Baker v. Halstead, 44-41;
Winborne v. Byrd, 92-7; Churchill v. Ins. Co., 92-485.
When the petition shows no merits, it will be dismissed. March v.
Thomas, 63-249; In re Brittain, 93-587.
Where the appellant fails to prepare a case and serve it upon the
adverse party, as required by the provisions of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, "the liberal practice among the members 0f the bar" in such
cases, is not sufficient ground to warrant a certiorari. Wilson v. Hutch
inson, 74-432.
Certiorari will not lie, usually, where there was not originally a right
of appeal. Badger v. Daniel, 82-468.
A certiorari will not be granted where the appeal is lost by appellant's
failure to comply with a demand for payment of clerk's fees for making
out the transcript, or where the application is not made to the next term
of the supreme court. Andrews v. Whisnant, 83-446; Smith v. Lynn,
84-837.
Nor where the petitioner's bond for costs is not justified. Chastain v.
Chastain, 87-283.
Where an appeal has been dismissed for want of a proper justification
of the undertaking on appeal, neither haste, ignorance nor inadvertence
in the appellant's counsel in preparing the undertaking on appeal, will
furnish any ground for issuing a certiorari as a substitute for an appeal.
Turner v. Quinn, 92-501.
Where an application for a certiorari does not assign any error in the
judgment sought to be brought up for review, nor disclose any merito
rious grounds of appeal, the writ will be refused. Short v. Sparrow,
96-348.
The writ of certiorari will not be granted where the petitioner failed
to perfect his appeal by reason of an agreement between the parties that
the lapse of time should not deprive him of the appeal, if they failed to
compromise the matter, and it was alleged by the respondent, but not
denied by the petitioner, that a compromise was effected. The writ is
allowed when the petitioner is guilty of no laches, or has been misled by
the opposing party. Williamson v. Boykin, 99-238.
Certiorari will not be granted if the applicant has been guilty of laches.
Peebles v. Braswell, 107-68.
Certiorari will not lie to perfect the record, when. —Unless the application
is made before the case is gone into on the merits. McDaniel v. Pollock,
87-503; Wilson v. Lineberger, 84-836.

the appeal in the supreme court, when it appears from the case on
appeal that the appellant has no merits. State v. McDowell, 91-541;
State v. Johnson, 93-559.
A certiorari, in order to correct the case on appeal, will not be granted,
when it appears from the petition that the particulars in which the peti
tioner asks to have it changed, are not material to the proper hearing of
the case. Porter v. Railroad, 97-63.
Ordinarily, where a defective transcript is filed, the supreme court will
direct the writ of certiorari, commanding a perfect record to be certified,
but where, as in this case, it is apparent the appeal is without merit, it
will be dismissed on motion. State v. Preston, 104-733.
When a case was regularly constituted in court, complaint and answer
filed, verdict and judgment thereon regular in all respects, and the sum
mons, complaint and answer are lost, so that copies are not sent up with
the record to the supreme court, and there is no averment of any effort
to have the papers supplied in the court below, though seven months
have elapsed since the appeal was taken, and there is no suggestion of
any error which would thereby be made to appear: Held, that the appel
lant is not entitled to a certiorari for these papers. Peebles v. Braswell,
107-68.
Certiorari will not lie in the nature of a writ of false judgment, when.— Cer
tiorari will not issue to enable a party to take advantage of a matter
occurring subsequently to the trial. Betts v. Franklin, 20-465.
Certiorari will not be granted where a writ of error will lie. Petty v.
Jones, 23-408.

permits judgment to be taken against both, he is not entitled to a cer
tiorari. State v. Jacobs, 44-218.
Where there is disagreement as to the waiver of Code rules. — Certiorari will
not be granted where the agreement to waive the Code rule in making
up the case is oral and denied by either party, or where there are con

Weber v. Taylor, 66-412; unless an order allowing an appeal in that
form was made by the judge below. Lindsay v. Moore, 83-444.
Where the judge gave an appellant, without authority, twenty days to
file his affidavit for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, by which the
appellant was misled, and it appears that questions of law are involved
which he has the right to have reviewed, a certiorari will issue. Stell
v. Barhani, 86-727.
In ordinary cases, when a writ of certiorari, as a substitute for an
appeal, issues from the supreme court, an undertaking as upon appeal
must be given iu the supreme court or in the court below; but if the
applicant would be entitled in law to appeal in forma pauperis, the writ
may issue without any undertaking being given. Brittain v. Mull,
93-490; State v. Warren, 100-489.
The bond must be justified. —A certiorari stands on the same footing as
an appeal, and will be dismissed if the bond is not justified. Chastaiu

Notice of application. —Notice of a certiorari must be given within two
terms after judgment from which the appeal is made. Williams v. Gor
man, 3-337; Erwin v. Erwin, 14-52S.
The application must now be made to the next term of the appellate
court. Staples v. Mooring, 26-215.
Where one loses his right of appeal, and fails to apply for a certiorari
in apt time, but r.o neglect of his own, and an execution issues, his
petition for certiorari may be filed, and a notice to show cause why it
should not be granted will issue to the appellee, and the sheriff will be
restrained till further order of the court. Sanders v. Norris, 82-4.
Application at next term of the appellate court. — Certiorari does not lie
where appellant failed to apply at next term of court after rendition of
judgment against him. Brown v. Williams, 84-116; Staples v. Mooring,
26-215; Andrews v. Whisnant, S3-446; Cross v. Cross, 90-15; Suiter v.

time, it may still be granted and execution restrained if there is no laches.
Sanders v. Norris, 82-4; Skinner v. Maxwell, 67-257; Simmons v. Dowd.
77-'55Where the appellant did not docket his appeal at the term at which it
should have been filed, nor apply at such term for a certiorari, it is too
late to apply at next term. Suiter v. Brittle, 92-53.
If the judge fail to settle the case on appeal in time to be docketed at
the next term of the supreme court, the appellant must bring up and
docket the record in its imperfect state and ask for a certiorari at that
term, or the appeal will be dismissed. Pitman v. Kimberly, 92-562;
Owens v. Phelps, 9t-253; State v. James, 108-792; Stephens v. Koonce,
106-255; Porter v. Railroad, 106-478; Baily v. Brown, 105-127.
Allegations may be controverted. —A certiorari is granted by the supreme
court on facts uucontroverted, apparent on the records or papers before
the court; but a rule is proper where the facts are not so apparent, but
in all cases the facts may be controverted when the certiorari is returned.
Cherry v. Slide, 9-400
Affidavits by respondent. —Upon petition for the writ of recordari a
notice was served upon the adverse party to show cause, etc., and he
appeared with affidavits in opposition to the granting of the writ: Held,
error in the judge to refuse to entertain the affidavits. The practice in
applications for writs of recordari and certiorari touched upon by
Smith, C J. Weaver v. Mining Co., 89-198.
From one superior court to another. —Where a cause is removed from one
superior court to another, the latter can issue a writ of certiorari directing
a more perfect transcript to be certified. State v. Collins, 14-1 r7; State
Reid, 18-377.
Can only issue to the court wherein cause is pending. —Writ of certiorari
can only issue to the court wherein the cause is pending. When the
cause has been carried by appeal to the supreme court, the petition for
the writ to the court below should be dismissed. Williams v. Williams,
71-427.
To officer to attend with original record. —In extraordinary cases, as when
contradictory transcripts are sent up, the court will direct the officer to
attend with the original record. State v. Reid, 18-377.

aside at the term ensuing its rendition, but an erroneous judgment
must be corrected by appeal or certiorari. State v. Horton, 89-581.
Where judge goes out of office.—Where a judge goes out of office before
preparing a case on appeal, a new trial will be awarded unless the parties
agree upon a statement of the case. A certiorari, if applied for, will be
granted to afford the parties an opportunity to adjust their differences
in the premises. Shelton v. Shelton. 89-185.
Note. —See provisions now in \ 550 for settlement of cases on appeal
by the judge after leaving office.
Exception to judge's charge, evidence not stated. —The supreme court will
not pass upon an exception to the charge of a judge, in the absence of
a statement of the evidence to which it applies, and in such a case a
writ of certiorari will be granted to supply the same. State v. Kennedy,
89-589.
Applicant must negative laches and show merits. —In an application for a
certiorari, the petitioner must not only show excuse for his laches, but
also allege meritorious ground of defence to the action. March v.
Thomas, 63-249; Brigman v. Jarvis, 30-451; Bledsoe v. Snow, 48-99;
Pritchard v. Sanderson, 92-41; Peebles v. Braswell, 107-68.
But such ground may be of law and not of fact. Britt v. Patterson,
31-197.
Stiy of execution. —Where a defendant has lost his appeal but is granted
a writ of certiorari in lien thereof, the granting of the writ has the
effect of an appeal as to a stay of execution, and if the offence be bail
able, he is entitled to bail. State v. Walters, 97-489.
See, also, Certiorari, Bat. Dig., vol. 1, p. 208 el sea. ; vol. 3, p. 26; vol.
4, p. 64; Bailey's Dig., p. 61, and Rules, 41-43 of supreme court, post.
Recordari will lie, when. —When judgment is given against a petitioner

sworn allegation of merits, recordari should be granted. Critcher v.
McCadden, 64-262.

an appeal from a justice's court. Ledbetler v. Osborne, 66-379.

loses his appeal by the error of the justice and without any default
on his part, he is entitled to a recordari. Marsh v. Cohen, 68-283; State
v. Warren, 100-489.
An omission to give the notice of appeal in a trial before a justice
strictly within the ten days provided for will not preclude a party from
the right to have his case reheard by recordari. Marsh v. Cohen, 68-283.
Where an attorney accepted service without authority and judgment
is rendered against the defendant without his knowledge, a recordari
and supersedeas should be granted. Caldwell v. Beatty, 69-142.

court by recordari, from the summons to the trial docket, when no
error is assigned and no merits shown or alleged. Sossamer v. Hinson.

Even a delay of three months, if sufficiently accounted for, will not
bar a recordari. Koouce v. Pelletier, 82-236.
An application for a writ of recordari, as a substitute for an appeal,
need not contain an averment of merits, when the appeal was lost by
the conduct and neglect of the justice who tried the case. State v. War
ren, 100-489.
Recordari as a writ of false judgment. —Where the writ of recordari is
used as a writ of false judgment, as it can be used in this state, upon
its return the plaintiff must assign errors, and then the proceedings will
be as in other writs of error. Swain v. Smith, 65-211.
A writ of recordari is sometimes used as a writ of false judgment to
bring up a case to review an alleged error in law, and it is sometimes
used as a substitute for an appeal, in which case the whole matter is
tried de novo in the higher court. Caldwell v. Beatty, 69-365.
Where the error alleged is a defect of jurisdiction, such error may be
corrected upon a writ of recordari, used as a writ of false judgment,
although the party may have neglected to avail himself of the right of
Difference between certiorari and recordari. —Difference between recordari
and certiorari discussed. Anon., 2-469.
Supersedeas to accompany the order. —An order for a recordari should be
accompanied by a supersedeas and suspension of execution. Steadman
v. Jones, 65-388.
In forma pauperis. — It is not error to grant a writ of recordari as a sub
stitute for an appeal without requiring security, when the execution is
not stayed and no legal default is imputable to the party seeking relief;
and the writ may be granted in forma pauperis. State v. Warren,
100-489.
Recordari not an adjudication on the merits. —The granting of a recordari
is not an adjudication of any of the matters in controversy, but is merely
a substitute for an appeal. Moore v. Austin, 85-179.
Recordari necessary to review a docketed justice's judgment. —A justice's
judgment docketed in the superior court cannot be impeached, set aside
or modified in that court, except on a recordari first had. Cannon v.
Parker, 81-320; Ledbetter v. Osborne, 66-379; Birdsey v. Harris, 68-92;
Morton v. Rippy, 84-611.
Prerequisites to granting the application. —Before an application for a
recordari will be heard, the petitioner must aver that he has paid, or
offered to pay, the justice's fees Steadnian v. Jones, 65-388.
But objection that the fees have not been paid can only be taken by
the justice. Carmer v. Evers, 80-55.
The same diligence is required in applying for a recordari as a substi
tute for an appeal as in applving for a certiorari. Boing v. Railroad,
88-62.
See \ 564, post, and cases cited.
Where case is already in the superior court.— Where an appeal is taken to
the superior court and judgment is had therein, a recordari will not lie
to the justice's court. The case is already in the superior court. Cowles
v. Haynes, 67-128.
Eefusal to dismiss application. —No appeal lies from the refusal of the
court below to grant a motion to dismiss a petition for a recordari. An
appeal would lie from an order granting or refusing such writ. Perry v.
Whitaker, 72-578.
The decision of the judge upon a petition for recordari as a substitute
for an appeal, after proper notice to the adverse party, is res judicata
and final, subject only to review by appeal. Barnes v. Easton, 9S-116.
Amendment. —Amendment of a petition (or certiorari is not reviewable.
Pritchard v. Sanderson, 92-41.
If granted without notice. —A recordari granted upon application of one
party, without notice to the other and without any petition or affidavit
setting forth the grounds upon which it should be issued, is irregular and
will be dismissed. Wilcox v. Stephenson, 71-409.
If a writ of recordari is granted without notice, the opposing party
may be heard upon the merits, or other sufficient grounds, upon the
return thereof. Barnes v. Easton, 98-116.
After return of writ.—After return made by the justice to a writ of
recordari, it is too late to object that it was not addressed to him. Car
mer v. Evers, So-55.
Judge's duty to find the facts. —When the right to a recordari depends
upon facts proven or admitted before the judge of the superior court, it
is his duty to find and state the facts; and if this is not done, the supreme
court must overrule the decision below, as it cannot try any " issue of
fact." Collins v. Gilbert, 65-135.
See, also, Recordari, Bat. Dig., vol. 2, p. 1040, et sea., and Rule 14,
Superior Court Rules, post.
Sec. ~>4C>. Orders made out of court, how vacated or modi
fied. C. C. P., s. 207.
An order made out of court, without notice to the adverse
party, may be vacated or modified, without notice, by the
judge who made it, or may be vacated or modified on notice,
in the manner in which other motions are made.
Construed. —Construing this section with \ 344: Held, that where a
judge, acting on the complaint without notice to the defendant, grants
an injunction, he may afterwards, acting on the complaint alone, with
out notice to the plaintiff, modify or vacate the injunction, as irregularly
or improperly granted. But if he goes out of the complaint and takes
into consideration the answer, and the affidavits 61ed for the defendants,
the plaintiff is then entitled to notice, and may meet the affidavits by
counter affidavits. Sledge v. Blum, 63-374.
Notice of motion for judgment must still be given in probate court
proceedings. Blue v. Blue, 79-69. But the notice is not necessary in
the superior court at term. Clayton v. Jones, 6S-497. See 'i 594, post.
See. 54:7. Who may appeal. V. C. P., s. 2UH.
Any party aggrieved may appeal in the case prescribed
in this title.
* Eight of third party to appeal. —In an action for the possession of per
sonal property, under js 321, a third party claiming suchproperty loses his
right to be made a party to the suit, after a lapse of three years from the
filing of his affidavits and his motion to allow him to interplead. Quizre,
whether such claimant can appeal from an order of the presiding judge,
refusing his application to be made a party. Clemmons v. Hampton,
70-534When, in an action to recover real estate, both the plaintiff and a third
party claim to be the landlord of the defendant, such third person has a
right to be made a party to the action, and upon the refusal of his motion
on affidavit, to be let in, has a right to appeal. Rollins v. Rollins, 76-264.
If an application to be made a party to an action is denied, the appli
cant is a " party aggrieved," for such judgment affects a substantial right
which he has, for all the purposes of an appeal under this section. Ibid.
Defendant who has confessed judgment. —A defendant who has confessed
judgment has no right of appeal from such judgment ; but where an
appeal was allowed in such case by a justice of the peace, and the p)aintifF failed to move to dismiss the appeal in the superior court, the supreme
court may pass by the irregularities, and, regarding the proceedings as
in the nature of a writ of false judgment, consider the errors assigned
upon the record. Rush v. Steamboat Co., 67-47.
Surety on appeal bond.—Whether the surety on the appeal bond in the
appeal from a justice can appeal from the judgment in the superior
court, qucrre. Simmons v. Andrews, 106-201.
Sec. t>4S. Appeal, in what cases it may he taken. C. C. P.,
s. 29ft.
An appeal may be taken from every judicial order or
determination of a judge of a superior court, upon or
involving a matter of law or legal inference, whether made
in or out of term, which affects a substantial right claimed
in any action or proceeding ; or which, in effect, determines
the action, and prevents a judgment from which an appeal
might be taken ; or discontinues the action, or grants or
refuses a new trial.
An appeal will lie, when. —A plaintiff can appeal from a decision by a
judge at chambers, refusing an injunction. .Bank v. Jenkins, 64-719.
Quare. —If an appeal lies from an interlocutory order granting, refus
ing, or dissolving an injunction, and the effect of such appeal. French
v. Wilmington, 75-387.
Decision on order of arrest. —The decision upon a motion to vacate an
order of arrest or to discharge the defendant arrested therennder from
custody, passes upon a substantial right, and is appealable. Roulhac
v. Brown, 87-1.
Bastardy. —A proceeding in bastardy is a civil action, and either party
has the right of appeal, as a matter of course under the rules prescribed
for perfecting appeals in other civil cases. State v. Wilkie, 85-513;
State v. Crouse, 86-617.
Motion denied on ground of want of power. —Where a motion is denied on
the ground of a supposed want of power in the judge to grant it, when
he has the power, an appeal lies and the appellate court will reverse the
erroneous ruling in order that the court below may exercise the discre
tion confided to it, and refuse or grant the application according to its
judgment on the merits. Welch v. Kingsland, 89-179; Henderson v.
Graham, 84-496; Jarrett v. Gibbs, 107-303; In re Smith, 105-167.
Striking out consent reference. —The refusal of the judge to pass upon the
report of a referee under a consent reference, as also his order, without
consent of both parties, striking out the reference, is a ruling affecting a
substantial right, and' will lie reviewed upon appeal. Stevenson v. Felton, 99-58.
Setting aside allotment of homestead. —An order of the court setting
aside the allotment of a homestead, is not an order to which an excep
tion may be made and reserved for the final hearing, but is one from
which an appeal may be at once prosecuted. lieavans v. Goodrich,
98-217.
Renewal of appeal after withdrawing it. — A party to an action has a right
to renew his appeal after having once withdrawn it, provided he does so
within the time prescribed by the statute for perfecting appeals. State
v. Chastain, 104-900.
From a nonsuit. —Where, in deference to the opinion of the judge, a
plaintiff submits to a nonsuit and appeals, the nonsuit will be set aside
and a new trial ordered, if in any view of the evidence the plantiff has
made out a prima facie case. Abernathy v. Stowe, 92-213.
Where it appears in the record that the plaintiff took a nonsuit and
appealed before the issues arising on a counterclaim pleaded by defend
ant had been disposed of, but no objection was made by the defendant
at the time: Held, not to be such an exception as can be taken for the
first time in the supreme court. Harper v. Dail, 92-394.
Where, upon the whole evidence, the court intimates that the plain
tiff cannot recover, and in deference to such opinion he submits to a
nonsuit and appeals, if the evidence is voluminous and complicated, the
appellant must point out, in the statement of the case, the relations
which one part of the evidence bears to another, and where he insists
that one part of the evidence has a special effect, the view contended
for by him should also appear in the case as having been called to the
attention of the court and denied, otherwise the supreme court will
affirm the judgment. Gregory v. Forbes, 94-220.
Where the trial judge intimates an opinion that upon the plaintiff's
own evidence he cannot recover; upon the appeal, the supreme court
will consider all the evidence offered by the plaintiff as true, and in the
most favorable light for him. Springs v Schenck, 99-551; Gibbs v.
Lyon, 95-146.
A plaintiff may, in deference to" an intimation from the court that he
cannot maintain his action, submit to a nonsuit, and have the questions
of law reveiwed upon appeal. Hendrick v. Pratt, 94-101.
Parties to an action may agree that if a verdict rendered in favor of a
plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a question of lawreserved, is set aside, the plaintiff may submit to a judgment of nonsuit,
and upon appeal, the question will be reviewed in the supreme court.
Ibid.
Where the court intimated that the complaint did not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a cause of action, and the plaintiff asked leave to
amend, which was granted on condition that the plaintiff pay cost and
consent to a continuance, which conditions were declined by the plain
tiff, who took a nonsuit and appealed: It was held, that the appeal
would lay. Warner v. Railroad, 94-251.
. Whenever, in the progress of a trial, the plaintiff offers evidence to
prove facts necessary to establish his case, and it is excluded by the
court, he may voluntarily submit to a nonsuit and appeal, and have the
ruling reviewed. Mobley v. Watts, 98-284.
If a verdict in favor of a plaintiff is set aside upon the ground that
the court holds the question of law reserved, with the defendant, the
effect is to award a new trial, and the plaintiff—there being no agree
ment, or further intimation from the court—cannot voluntarily take a
nonsuit and appeal. Hendrick v. Pratt. 94-101.
After the jury was empaneled and the pleadings read, the defendant
moved to dismiss the action, upon the ground that it did not contain a
statement of facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. This motion
was refused, the judge remarking that a cause of action was stated, but
not such a cause as would entitle plaintiff to the relief he insisted on in
the argument of his counsel. Thereupon plaintiff submitted to a non
suit and appealed. No evidence was introduced by either party: Held,
that there was no ruling to justify plaintiff's course, as there were no
admitted facts, or facts that might be found upon proofs, upon which a
practical ruling could have been made, and the appeal would not be
entertained. Davis v. Ely, 100-2S3.
Where, upon objection, certain testimony was excluded on the trial
below, and the plaintiff submitted to a judgment of nonsuit, which was
afterwards stricken out and the case reinstated for trial, no appeal lies, and
an appeal taken by defendant will be dismissed. Bain v. Bain, 106-239.
Where, at the close of the testimony, the judge stated that he should
charge the jury that, if they believed the evidence, the defendant had
established his defence: Held, that the plaintiff might submit to a non
suit and have the question of law raised by the testimony, reviewed on
appeal. Tiddy v. Harris, 101-589.
Refusal of nonsuit.—Refusal of the superior court to allow a nonsuit
after verdict and judgment will not be reviewed on appeal. Brown v.
King, 107-313; Kingsbury v. Hughes, 61-328.
Overruling demurrer. —An appeal liesfrom an order overruling a demur
rer. Commissioners v. Magnin, 78-181^ Ramsay v. Railroad, 91-418.
Correction of erroneous judgment. —A motion to correct an erroneous
judgment, rendered at a former term of the court, will not be allowed,
if it appears that the error committed was that of the court, and not
that of the party. In such case the remedy is by appeal, certiorari or
petition to rehear. Simmons v. Dowd, 77-155.
Death of Appellee. —Right of appeal is not lost on account of the death
of adverse party. Wood v. Watson, 107-52.
When either party to a suit dies before judgment, it is the duty of the
adverse party to suggest the death to the court. If appeal is desired,
the proper course is to make the heirs of the deceased party at law
parties to the action, and serve notice of appeal upon them. Ibid.
Agreement not to appeal. —A party cannot lose the right to appeal by
an agreement that the judgment of the court below shall be final, and
that neither party will appeal therefrom. Falkner v. Hunt, 68-475;
Ruunion v. Ramsay, 93-410.
When there is a preliminary plea in bar. —Where an action is brought for
an account, and the answer pleads matter in bar of the account, and a
trial is had of the issues raised by the plea in bar, an appeal lies by the
defendant from a judgment ordering an account and before the account
is taken. Clements v. Rogers, 95-248.
It seems that an appeal will lie from an order of reference where there
is an undisposed of plea in bar, and the defendant objects to the refer
ence on that ground. Grant v. Hughes, 96-177.
Proceedings in contempt. —Appeal lies where the contempt, for which a
judgment is rendered, is other than such as is committed in presence of
the court or calculated to interrupt its business. In re Daves, 81-72;
Bond v. Bond, 69-97; In re Walker, 82-95; Robbins, ex parte, 63-309;
In /-fDeaton, 105-59.
Where, at the instance of a party litigant, judgment of imprisonment
is rendered against the adverse party for contempt in wilfully disobeying
an order of the court, the party aggrieved is entitled to an appeal. Cromartie v. Com'rs, 85-211.
But not from a judgment imposing a fine for a contempt committed in
presence, or near enough to interfere in business, of the court. In re
Daves, 81-72; State v. Mott, 49-499.
Where, upon the trial, a party to the action was ordered to surrender
the possession of a paper to the custody of the court, and refusing, was
committed for contempt, and thereupon obeyed the order and was set
at liberty, but excepted and appealed: Held, (1) that such a refusal was
a contempt; (2) that as the appeal presented only an abstract question
of the power to make the order, it should be dismissed. Thompson v.
Onley, 96-9.
In that class of contempts in which an appeal lies, the findings of fact
by the superior court are final, but when the contempt proceedings are
in a court inferior to the superior court the findings are reviewable on
appeal in that court. In re Deaton, 105-59.
In contempt proceedings the facts found by the judge are conclusive,
and on appeal only their sufficiency to warrant the judgment can be
reviewed. Young v. Rollins, 90-125.
No appeal lies. —The court, on appeal, will not review a decision or
determination affecting neither the actual nor legal merits of a contro
versy. Therefore, an appeal from an order continuing in force a former
order made in the cause was dismissed. Childs v. Martin, 68-307.
No appeal lies if no judgment has been rendered. Taylor v. Bostic,
93-4I5'. Baum v. Shooting Club, 94-217; State v. Hazell, 95-623; State v.
Lockyear, 95-633; State v. Smith, 95-680.
Refusal to dismiss, —No appeal lies from a refusal to dismiss an action.
McBryde v. Patterson, 78-412; Railroad v. Richardson, 82-343; Capel v.
Peebles, 80-90; Allen v. Royster, 107-278; Mitchell v. Kilburn, 74-483;
Smith v. Mitchell, 63-620; Garrett v. Trotter, 65-430; Mastin v. Marlow,
65-695; Long v. Bank, 81-41; Gay v. Brookshire, 82-409; Wilson v. Lineberger, 82-412; Plemmons v. Improvement Co., 108-614.
No appeal lies from a refusal to dismiss an action or to nonsuit the
plaintiff. Stith v. Lookabill, 71-25; Foster v. Penry, 77-160; Crawley v.
Woodfin, 78-4.
No appeal lies from the refusal of the court below to grant a motion
to dismiss a petition for a writ of recordari. An appeal lies from the
order of the court either granting or refusing to grant such writ. Perry
v. Whitaker, 77-102.
Quaie, as to whether an appeal will lie from a refusal of the superior
court to dismiss an appeal from a justice's judgment, though the correct
practice seems to l>e to reserve the exception (as to the refusal to dismiss)
and proceed with the trial, so that on the appeal the whole case may be
disposed of. Spaugh v. Boner, S5-208
No appeal lies from a refusal to dismiss an action, but, after such
motion and refusal, the company might treat all proceedings as a nullity
as to it, or have ati exception noted and proceed with the cause. Plem
mons v. Improvement Co., 108-614.
Confession of judgment. — A defendant who confesses judgment has no
right of appeal. Rush v. Steamboat Co., 67-47.
Pro forma judgment. —Appeals from pro forma judgments will not be
considered. Hines v. Hines, S4-122.
Order setting aside judgment for mistake, excusable neglect, etc. —The judg
ment of the superior court upon the facts relied upon to sustain a motion,
under Z>. 274, to set aside a judgment as to the truth of such facts, is final.
The judgment as to their sufficiency in law is subject to review. Johuson v. Duckworth, 72-244.
While the supreme court has jurisdiction, on appeal, to determine
what constitutes " mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,"
under 'i 274 of The Code, it has no authority to review or interfere with
exercise of the discretion vested in the judge of the superior court by
that section, in refusing to set aside judgments. Beck v. Bellamy,
93-129; Hudgins v. White, 65-393; Foley v. Blank, 92-476.
Should the judge set aside a judgment upon a state of facts which
did not bring the case within the scope of the statute, his action would
be subject to correction on appeal. Beck v. Bellamy, 93-129.
See \ 274, and cases cited.
Judgment for costs. —An appeal does not He from a judgment for costs
only. Kidd v. Morrison, 61-31; State v. Railroad, 74-2S7; except where
the appellant is a fiduciary; May v. Darden, 83-237.
An appeal will be dismissed where it satisfactorily appears that the
question of costs is the only matter involved. Hasty v. Fuuderbunk,
89-93; Martin v. Sloan, 69-128; Kidd v. Morrison, 61-31.
As a general rule the supreme court will not decide a case where noth
ing but the question of costs is involved, but if some important substan
tial right is involved, an exception will be made and an opinion given.
Martin v. Sloan, 69-128; Osborne v. Henry, 66-354.
When the subject-matter of the action has been lost, destroyed or
adjusted between the parties, an appeal will not be allowed from a judg
ment for costs only. But when the whole matter in litigation is an alleged
liability for costs, as in the case of a prosecutor in a criminal action, an
appeal lies as in other cases. State v. Byrd, 93-624.
Although an appeal will not lie when the costs only are involved, yet
when it calls in question the entire judgment and the costs only as inci
dental, it will be entertained. Hobson v. Buchanan, 96-444.
Where, pending the appeal from an order granting or refusing an
injunction till the hearing, the case is tried and disposed of and no appeal
is taken therefrom, the appeal will be dismissed, since only costs are
involved. Pritchard v. Baxter, 108-129.
Continuance. — No appeal lies from an order granting'or refusing a con
tinuance. State v. Lindsay, 78-499; State v. Scott, 8o-365; Johnson v.
Maxwell, 87-18. Contra, Bank v. Tiddy, 67-169.
Does not lie from an order granting a continuance, unless there is
palpable abuse. McCurry v. McCurry, 82-296; Austin v. Clarke, 70-458;
Armstrong v. Wright, 8-93.
No appeal lies from an order granting a continuance. Isler v. Dewey;
79-1; State v. Vann, 84-722; Jaffray v. Bear, 98-58.
The granting or refusing a continuance is entirely discretionary with
the presiding judge, and cannot be assigned for error on appeal. Dupree
v. Ins. Co., 92-417.
Where an order grants a continuance not merely for the term, and
for some incidental reason that is an adjudication which arrests the action
for a length of time, it affects a substantial right, and can be appealed
from. Stratford v. Stratford, 92-297.
Granting or refusing a continuance is a matter of discretion, and not
reviewable. Banks v. M'fg Co., 108-282.
Note. —Sections 401 and 402, if followed more strictly, would save
costs in cases where there is meritorious ground for continuance, and
when there is not, the last paragraph of § 402, as well as the principle,
that justice shall not be delayed, forbids the grant of the continuance.
Interlocutory orders. —No appeal lies from an interlocutory order not
precluding the rights of any party. Sutton v. Schonwald, 8o-20; Tele
graph Co. v. Railroad, 83-420; Railroad v. Warren, 92-620.
No appeal lies from an interlocutory order appointing commissioners
to assess damages for condemnation of a fence-way under the act of
l881, ch. 172 (No Fence Law), Commissioners v. Cook, 86-18.
An appeal lies at once from an interlocutory order that may in effect
put an end to the action, or that may prejudice a substantial right of
the party complaining. Merrill v. Merrill, 92-657.
An appeal cannot be taken from an order of the superior court, which
does not terminate the action, and which does not deprive the appellant
of any substantial right which he might lose if the order is not reviewed .
before final judgment. Under such circumstances, the party can have
his exception entered of record, and, if necessary, can have it consid
ered by the supreme court on appeal after the final judgment. Clem
ent v. Foster, 99-255; Welch v. Kinsland, 93-281; Hailey v. Gray,
93-195An order remanding the papers to the clerk, in order that he may
hear a motion to amend the pleadings, to the end that an account
should be talcen, is interlocutory and does not impair a substantial right,
and cannot be appealed from. Loftin v. Rouse, 94-508.
Appeals from interlocutory or subsidiary orders, judgments and
decrees made in a cause, carry up for review only the ruling of the
court upon that specific point. The order or judgment appealed from,
is not vacated, but further proceedings under it are suspended until its
validity is determined. Meanwhile the action remains in the court
below. Green v. Griffin, 95-50.
An appeal from an interlocutory order only lies when it affects some
substantial right and will work injury to the appellant if not corrected
before an appeal from the final judgment. Lane v. Richardson, 101-181;
Leak v. Covington, 95-193; Bynuin v. Commissioners, 101-412; Martin
v. Flipper, 101-452; Spencer ex parte, 95-271.
An order appointing commissioners to assess damages is interlocutory,
and no appeal will be entertained until after final judgment upon the
report of the copimissioners. Railroad v. Warren, 92-620; Hendrick
v. Railroad, 98-431.
When appellant is not seriously prejudiced by delay, and not deprived
of any substantial right by the rendition of an interlocutory judgment,
etc., the regular and orderly method of procedure is to except and pro
ceed to final judgment, so that the Appeal may bring up the whole case
at once. Sneeden v. Harris, 107-31 1; Blackwell v. McCain, 105-460.
In an action to foreclose a mortgage, it appeared that the plaintiffs
had a lien on the land specified, and the court made an order directing
that an account be taken to ascertain the balance of the debt yet unpaid,
and retaining the cause for further action: Held, that the order was
interlocutory, and appeal would not lie from it. Williams v. Walker,
J07-334Order making additional parties. —An appeal can be taken from an order
of the superior court either making or refusing to make additional
parties, when such order affects a substantial right of the appellant;
and it seems that the appeal may either be taken at once, or it can be
assigned as error on an appeal from the final judgment. Merrill v.
Merrill, 92-657.
Where the superior court allowed a nol. pios. as to certain defend
ants, who appealed from the order, and moved in the supreme court to
make other persons parties, whose presence in the action was only
necessary if the nol. pros, had been erroneously entered: Held, that the
motion to make parties will not be considered, until the question raised
by the nol. pros, is disposed of. Lee v. Eure, 92-283.
The supreme court will not, before the final determination of an
action, entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order making addi
tional parties. Merrill v. Merrill, supra, distinguished; Lane v. Rich
ardson, 101-181.
Premature appeals. —No appeal lies from an order re-committing a ref
eree's report, with instructions to correct the same in conformity to the
rulings of the court. Jones v. Call, 89-188; Torrence v. Davidson, 90-2;
(".rant v. Reese, 90-3; Lutz v. Cline, 89-1X6; Leak v. Covington, 95-193;
Wallace v. Douglas, 105-42; Com'rs v. Magnin, 85-114.
When transcript fails to show a judgment of record appealed from,
the appeal will be dismissed. Logan v. Harris, 90-7.
Where part of the issues in an action are decided by a trial, and others,
material to the final disposition of the cause, are left open for further
adjustment, an appeal is premature, and it will not be entertained.
Hailey v. Gray, 93-195; University v. Hank, 92-651.
Where a demurrer to a counterclaim is sustained and the counterclaim
stricken out, the defendant cannot appeal from the judgment, and so
stop the trial of the action, but must note his exception to the action of
the court, and bring the point up for review on an appeal from the final
judgment. Knott v. Burwell, 96-272; Bazemore v. Bridgers, 105-191.
An appeal, from an order of the superior court for the docketing ofa case
brought up from a justice's court by recordari, is premature, and will be
dismissed. State v. Warren, 100-489.
Where, in a processioning proceeding, the defendant filed exceptions
to the report of the freeholders, which were overruled, but the court
directed an issue to be submitted to the jury in respect to the location
of the disputed land, an appeal from the judgment overruling theexcep
tions before the trial of this issue and the final judgment of the court
thereon, was premature. Martin v. Flippin, 101-452.
When, in an action against a sheriff for a false return, the court per
mits such return to be amended, the plaintiff should note his exception,
and, unless the amended return is admitted to be true, proceed to try the
issue. An appeal before final judgment on such admission, or a verdict,
is premature, and will be dismissed. Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
Where the jury rendered their verdict for the plaintiff, and therenpon
the court, before rendering judgment upon the verdict, made an order
of reference for an account between the parties to ascertain the balance
due, to which no exception was made, but defendant appealed, such
appeal must be dismissed as premature. Blackwell v. McCain, 105-460.
When the court sets aside a verdict as to one issue, and enters an inter
locutory judgment as to the other, the proper course of the party injured
is to note an exception, and go on to the trial of the remaining issue, so
that the whole appeal may he considered at once. Appeal from such
interlocutory judgment, and at such stage of the proceeding, is prema
ture, and will be dismissed. Milliard v. Oram, 106-467.
Does not lie from a preliminary order settling the issues. School
Committee v. Kesler, 66-323.
Appeal does not lie from a failure to frame an issue not tendered by a
party. Kidder v. Mcllhenny, 81-123; Curtis v. Cash, 84-41.
Does not lie from an order appointing commissioners to lay out a rightof-way. Telegraph Co. v. Railroad, 83-420.
An appeal lies from an order confirming the report of commissioners
to lay out a right-of-way. Railroad v. Railroad, 83-499.
In a criminal case an appeal does not lie from the overruling of the
defendant's demurrer to an indictment. Where the demurrer is sus
tained, the judgment is final, and the state can appeal. State v. Mc
Dowell, 84-798.
Ordinarily, questions arising and decided during the examination of a
witness cannot be singled out and the exception made the subject of a
separate appeal, yet such appeal may be sustained when a party is
deprived of important testimony, and the action, notwithstanding such
appeal, may proceed to full preparation for trial. Com'rs v. Lemly,
85-341.
An appeal from an order setting aside a report of commissioners in
partition will not be dismissed as premature. Skinner v. Carter, 108-106.
Appeals in a fragmentary manner. —The court will not entertain appeals
brought up in a fragmentary manner. Hines v. Hines, 84-122; Commis
sioners v. Satchweli, 88-1; White v. Utley, 94-511.
The whole case must come up on appeal. Hines v. Hines, 84-122.
An appeal from the ruling upon one of several issues will be dismissed.
The trial and appeal must be upon the whole case. Hines v. Hines,
84-122; Arrington v. Arrington, 91-301.
The trial of an action should embrace and determine all the matters
at issue, so that a final judgment may be entered and any errors com
mitted may be corrected upon one appeal. "Fragmentary appeals " will
not be tolerated. Therefore, in an action to recover land, with damages
for its detention, where the issue as to the title and right to possession
was tried, but the issue as to damages was reserved to be afterwards tried
if it should be adjudged that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the
supreme court would not entertain an appeal for reviewing alleged errors
on the trial of the issue submitted. Hicks v. Gooch, 93-112. See Hilliard v. Oram, supra.
Fragmentary appeals will not be allowed when the subject-matter
could be afterwards considered and error corrected without detriment t
the appellant. But this rule does not apply to interlocutory orders, the
granting or refusal of which may produce present injury or loss. Davis
y. Ely, 100-283.
Matters of discretion and not reviewable. —An appeal does not lie from the
superior to the supreme court upon the refusal of the judge below to
pass upon the competency of evidence and its materiality before the
trial any more than from his refusal to try or continue a cause, or from
his order to allow or disallow an amendment. Wallington v. Mont
gomery, 74-372.
No appeal lies from an order' setting aside a compulsory reference, nor
from a refusal to allow thereupon an amendment presenting a new issue.

Does not lie from a refusal of the judge to re-open a case for additional
evidence. Pain v. Pain, 80-322.

withdrawal of the subject-matter to which it relates, and the consequent
continuance of the cause. Gay v. Brookshire, 82-409.
Nor from au order for several defendants to pay a sum in solido with
out a previous finding that the fund was under their joint control. Corbin v. Berry, 83-27.
No appeal lies for allowing a leading question to be asked by a party
of his own witness. Bank v. Pinkers, 83-377; Johnson v. Allen, 104-131.
Nor from a refmal to amend a record. Perry v. Adams, 83-266; State
v. Swepson, 83-584.

at a term subsequent to the one to which the report is submitted is a

the court, and not reviewable. Jones v. Jones, 94-111.
Whether or not the facts pleaded in bar are such as to require that
they be passed upon before ordering a reference to state an account, rests
in the sound discretion of the court, and the decision of the court thereon
is not appealable. State v. McMahon, 85-296; Leak v. Covington, 87-501.
Where the judge below, in the exercise of his discretion, refuses to
open the bidding on an advance of ten per cent, before the sale is con
firmed, the supreme court will not direct him to do so. Trull v. Rice,
92-572The refusal of the court to hear affidavits upon a motion to confirm a
report in partition is a matter of discretion and not reviewable. Skin
ner v. Carter, 108-106.
Amendments. —No appeal lies from refusing or allowing amendment to
complaint. Lippard v. Roseman, 72-427; Dobson v. Chambers, 78-334.
Nor from a refusal to allow defendant to put in au answer at the trial
term. Boddie v. Woodard, 83-2.
Semble, that a refusal to hold an answer frivolous is not appealable.

No appeal lies from a refusal to strike out part of defendant's answer.

ings to be amended, is discretionary and not reviewable. Warden v.

nolds v. Smathers, 87-24.
Doubtful if an appeal lies from an order making additional parties.
Johnston v. Neville, 68-177.

cretion and not reviewable. Jarrett v. Gibbs, 107-303.

irregular judgment at the same term it was taken. Dick v. Dickson,
63-488.

Albertson v. Terry, 109—, and cases cited.
From order granting or refusing a new trial. —This section applies only to
"matters of law or legal inferences," and not to an order involving a
mere discretion, and whether a new trial ought to be granted, because
the verdict is against the weight of evidence, is a matter solely in the
discretion of the judge who tries the cause. Jenkins v. Ore Dressing
Co., 65-563.
Where a judge set aside a verdict and granted a new trial for error of
law in his instructions to the jury, the party prevailing may appeal
from the order granting a new trial, and if it appear that his instruc
tions were correct, it will be set aside. Bryan v. Heck, 67-322.
An order setting aside a verdict as being against the weight of evi
dence is not appealable. Watts v. Bell, 71-405; Stanton v. Hughes,
97-318; Snowden v. Railroad, 95-93; McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
In an appeal from an order granting or refusing a new trial, the presid
ing judge should put upon the record the matters including the order,

not. Moore v. Edmiston, 70-471.
Where, upon a trial in the court below, the plaintiff asked for a new
trial, and upon its being refused, appealed to the supreme court, and at

of the court below was affirmed, dismissing the plaintiff's action; in
such case, the appeal of the defendant to the supreme court will be dis
missed with costs. Home v. Home, 72-534.

Johnson v. Bell, 74-355; Clegg v. White Soapstone Co., 67-302.
Upon a motion by the defendant for a new trial, in an action for dam
ages, it is not error for the court to refuse to hear the evidence of a juror,

the jury did not consider that some of the property was probably dam
aged before the cause of action arose, there being no evidence to that
eifect. Bellamy v. Pippin, 74-46.
Where a witness, after verdict, filed an affidavit that he was mistaken
in his evidence on a material point, the granting or refusing a new trial
is discretionary, and no appeal lies. Dalton v. Webster, S2-279.
Where there is any evidence to go to the jury, the supreme court
cannot pass on its sufficiency, and when the case on appeal states that
there was much evidence on certain questions, introduced by both parties,
that court cannot say that there is no evidence to support the verdict.
Woodley v. Hassell, 94-157.
Where the record only shows that the trial judge set the verdict aside,
and granted a new trial, without specifying the facts or reasons which
induced him to do so, and these do not appear with certainty, in the
record, it will be presumed that the new trial was granted in the exer
cise of the discretionary powers vested in the trial judge, and the appeal
will be dismissed. Braid v. Eukins, 95-123.
An order granting or refusing a motion for a new trial in a case where

Thomas v. Myers, N7-31; Braid v. Lukins, 95-123; Carson v. Dellinger,

appeal. Bryant v. Fisher, 85-71.
In actions purely equitable, the supreme court has jurisdiction to pass
on the questions offact, as distinguished from the issues offact, where
the evidence on which the judge below acted accompanies the record,
and can be examined by the appellate court. Coates v, Wilkes, 92-376.
In an application to set aside a judicial sale and re-open the biddings,

erned by the facts as found by the judge. Trull v. Rice, 92-572.
The finding by the trial judge that a witness, whose deposition is
offered, was not within the state, there being some evidence of these
facts, will not be reviewed in the supreme court. Brantou v. O'Briant,

way connected with the freehold, it disposes of the question of their
being f1xtures in the supreme court. Foote v. Gooch, 96-271.

on appeal, if there be any evidence to warrant it. Barbee v. Green,
92-471; Smith v. Kron, 96-392.

dence. In the application of this jurisdiction the supreme court may,
in certain cases, direct further testimony to be taken, or direct an issue
of fact to be framed and remanded for trial by jury. Gntewood v. Leak,

Arlington, 105-377.

unless requested. Ibid; Holdeu v. Purefoy, 108-163.

erly that there was no evidence to support them. Travers v. Deaton,
107-500.
There was a judgment in the court of a justice of the peace dismiss
ing the action as to one of the defendants; in a subsequent action

plaintiffs: Held, that this finding is conclusive. Davie v. Davis. 10S-501.

judgment is so rendered. Notice of such appeal may be given in a rea
sonable time afterwards. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
The appeal will be dismissed when it does not appear in the record
that an appeal was taken. Mfg. Co. v. Simmons, 97-89.
An appeal will not be dismissed because no entry thereof appears in .
the record proper, when the case on appeal shows that it was duly taken
and perfected. Fore v. Railroad, 101-526.
Notice necessary. — Cases brought to this court by appeals taken without
notice will be dismissed upon motion. Campbell v. Allison, 63-568.
Under C C. P., \ 80 (not brought forward in The Code of 1883), filing
notice of appeal in clerk's office was a sufficient notice. Brantley v.
Jordan, 90-25.
If appeal bond filed. —The transcript must show that an appeal was
taken, but if the appeal bond is filed case will be remanded that record
may be amended to show whether an appeal was taken or not. Moore
v. Vanderburg, 90-10
Filing an appeal bond and its approval in open court is sufficient
notice to appellee of the appeal. Capehart v. Biggs, 90-373.
Notice served on co-defendant. —If the judgment from which the appeal
is taken be in favor of a co-defendant of the appellant, the latter should
serve the required notices and case upon such co-defendant, as he
thereby becomes the adverse party. Rose v. Baker, 99-323.
Notice of appeal not a part of the record. —Notice of appeal, though in
the record, is no mare a part of it than the case upon appeal. Ferrell v.
Thompson, 107-420.
Appeal bond filed in supreme court.—While by the act of 1889 (js 552, post,
as amended), the supreme court may allow the undertaking on appeal
to be filed in that court it will not do so unless the appellant shows
reasonable ground for his failure to file it in the prescribed time. Har
rison v. Hoff, 102-26.
Notice of appeal and filing of appeal bond both must be within ten days.—
Where there is failure either to give notice of appeal, or to file the
appeal bond in ten days, the appeal will be dismissed. Applewhite v.
Fort, 85-596.
Appeal by one, judgment against two. —Where a judgment is rendered
against two defendants, one only of whom appeals, the appeal does not
vacate the judgment as to the defendant who does not appeal. Rollins
v. Love, 97-210.
Waiver of Code time. —If an agreement to waive Code time is not
admitted, nor in the record, the requirements of C. C. P. will be enforced.
Wade v. Newbern, 72-49S; Taylor v. Brower, 78-8; Adams v. Reeves,
74-106.
It is the uniform practice to confirm the judgment when appellant
has failed to send up a statement of the case, except when the record
shows a written agreement waiving the lapse of time, or where an oral
agreement to that effect can be shown by the affidavit of the appellee
rejecting that of the appellant. Twitty v. Logan, 85-592.
Appeals from justice's court. —On a trial in a justice's court, no notice
of appeal need be served when the adverse party is present when it is
craved. State v. Crouse, 86-617; Richardson v. Debnam, 75-390.
A party appealing from a justice's judgment must serve notice of
appeal, and his grounds therefor, within ten days after judgment.

But the court may allow it to be given afterwards. Marsh v. Cohen,

See I 564, post, and cases cited; also note amendment to \ 549, supra.
Sec. iiiiO. A ppetils to be entered by clerk oil judgment docket;
case, how stated and settled. C. C. P., s. 301 . V. V. P., s.
.ill. 1889,c.l61.
Within the time prescribed in the preceding section, the
appellant shall cause his appeal to be entered by the clerk
on the judgment docket, and notice thereof to be given to
the adverse party [unless the record shows an appeal taken
or prayed at the trial, which shall be sufficient]. He shall
cause to be prepared a concise statement of the case,
embodying the instructions of the judge as signed by him,
if there be an exception thereto, and the requests of the
counsel of the parties for instructions if there be any excep
tion on account of the granting or withholding thereof, and
stating separately in articles numbered, the errors alleged.
A copy of this statement shall be served on the respondent
within ten days from the entry of the appeal taken ; within
five days after such service, the respondent shall return the
copy with his approval or specific amendments indorsed or
attached ; if the case be approved by the respondent, it
shall be filed with the clerk as a part of the record ; if not
returned with objections within the time prescribed, it shall
be deemed approved ; if returned with objections as pre
scribed, the appellant shall immediately request the judge
to fix a time and place for settling the case before him ; and
the judge shall forthwith notify the attorneys of the parties
to appear before him for that purpose at a certain time and
place, within the judicial district, which time shall not be
more than twenty days from the receipt of such request ;
and at the time and place stated, the judge shall settle and
sign the case, and deliver a copy to the attorney of each
party, or if the attorneys be not present, file a copy in the
office of the clerk of the court : Provided, that if the judge
shall have left the district "before the notice of disagreement,
he may settle the case without returning to the district. In
settling the casek the written instructions signed by the
judge, and the written requests for instructions signed by
the counsel, and the written exceptions shall be deemed
conclusive as to what such instructions, requests and excep
tions were. If a copy of the case settled was delivered to
the appellant, he shall within five days thereafter file the
same with the clerk, and in case he fails to do so, the
respondent may file his copy. The judge shall settle the
case on appeal within sixty days after the termination of a
special term or after the courts of the district shall have
ended, and if the judge in the meantime shall have gone
out of office, he shall settle the case as if he were still in
office, and any judge failing to comply with this section
shall be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars, for the
use of any person who will sue for the same.
Note. —The words above set out in brackets, in lines 4 and 5, were
added by act 1889, ch. 161. The words, "ten" and "five," in lines
13 and 14, were substitutions made by the same act for the words "five"
and "three," respectively.
Appeal may be taken without leave of judge. —An appeal can be taken
without the sanction of the judge, and even against his prohibition, if
the parties can agree upon the statement of the case. Skinner v. Max
well, 67-257.
An appeal being now the act of the appellant alone, no presumption
of regularity arises, because of its having been taken during a term of
the court from which it comes. Campbell v. Allison, 63-568.
Appeal must be to the next term. —See cases cited under \ 544, ante.
Waiver of time by agreement of counsel. —Within certain limits the par
ties may, by consent, waive the time of complying with the rules for
perfecting an appeal, and the supreme court will respect such agree
ments between counsel, if they appear upon the record. If such agree
ment does not appear, the supreme court will adhere to and enforce the
rules prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure. Wade v. Newbern, 72498; Sever v. McLaughlin, 82-332; Taylor v. Brower, 7S-8; Rouse v.
Quinn, 75-354; Walton v. Pearson, S2-464; Hutchinson v. Rumfelt,
83-441.
Where, upon an appeal to the supreme court, it appears that the appel
lant has failed to prepare and serve upon the appellee a statement of
the same, within the time prescribed by the statute, and objection is
taken by the appellee on that ground, the appeal will be dismissed, unless
there has been a waiver of the irregularity. Upon a motion to dismiss
the appeal in such case, the supreme court cannot hear contradictory
evidence, and the motion will be allowed if the waiver is denied, unless
it appear from the affidavits filed by the appellee that there has been
such a waiver. Adams v. Reeves, 74-106.
An agreement " plaintiff may have thirty days to file his case on appeal
from adjournment of court, and the defendant thirty days thereafter,"
entitles defendant to thirty days after service of appellant's case. Mitchell
v. Hoggard, 105-173.
What transcript should contain.—How appeals to be entitled—officers
neglecting the provisions of this title not entitled to costs. Jacobs v.
Burgwyn, 63-196.
It is the right and duty of an appellant, subject to the provisions of
The Code, to direct what part, of the record should go up, and only such
part should go up as is necessary to enable the court to pass upon the
exceptions. Sudderth v. McCombs, 67-353.
Matter not pertinent to the issue should not encumber the transcript
of the case on appeal. Hilton v. McDowell, 87-364.
Cost of irrelevant matter seat up with transcript will be taxed against
appellant, whether successful or not. Grant v. Reese, 82-72; Clayton v.
Johnston, 82-423.
Every transcript or record, to be authoritative, must set forth before
what persons or person the proceedings were had, or by whose authority
the record was made, so that it may appear that the proceedings were
not coram non judice. Howell v. Ray, 83-558; State v. King, 27-203;
State v. Ward, 30-530.
The transcript of a case on appeal must be complete within itself, and
not supplied by reference to the transcript of another case. Branch v.
Railroad, 88-573.
Where a witness is ruled out as incompetent, it is not necessary to set
out what it was expected to prove, otherwise where the exceptionMs as
to his competency to testify as to certain definite matters. Hampton v.
Hardin, 88-592.
The transcript is imperfect if it does not appear therefrom, with rea
sonable certainty, that the court was duly held and that it had obtained
jurisdiction of the parties by service or waiver of process. State v.
Butts, 91-527; Daniel v. Rogers, 95-134; Jones v Hoggard, 107-349.
See §551, post.
If transcript defective. — If the transcript is a set of loose papers, dis
connected, the case will be remanded. State v. Jones, 82-691; State v.
Guilford, 49-83; Goff v. Pope, 82-696.
Where the transcript of the record sent to the supreme court is imper
fect, the appeal will not be dismissed, but the papers will be remanded,
in order that a proper transcript may be sent up. Weil v. Everett,
83-685; Spence v. Tapscott, 92-576.
Where no errors were assigned in the case, and none appeared in the
record proper, but it appeared that counsel for both sides had agreed
that all the papers in the cause should constitute the case on appeal, the
case was remanded, in order that error might be properly assigned.
Holly v. Holly, 94-639.
Where the transcript of the record upon appeal does not show any
process, or pleading, but only contains a statement of the facts agreed
upon, a judgment and an undertaking on appeal, the case will be
remanded, in order that the record may be perfected. Daniel v. Rogers,
95-134: Wyatt v. Railroad, 109—.
Where a transcript ou appeal contains only the judgment of the court
below, and shows no process or pleading, the cause will be remanded.
Rowland v. Mitchell, 90-649.
Where the facts, upon appeal to the supreme court, appear only from
the statement of the case, and there is no transcript of the record, and
it does not appear that a court was held at the time and place appointed
by law, the appeal will be dismissed. Sneeden v. Harris, 107-311.
Where both parties appeal.—Where both parties appeal, a transcript of
the record must be sent up by each appellant and the appeals must be
docketed separately, as distinct cases. This rule cannot be waived by
consent of counsel, and unless it is done the case will not be heard.
Morrison v. Cornelins, 63-340; Jones v. Hoggard, 107-349; Perry v. Adams,
96-347.
Duty of appellant. —A judgment appealed from must be affirmed in the
supreme court, if no error appears in the record, when the statement
as prepared by the appellant has been returned with objections, and
the appellant has failed to apply to the judge below to give the par
ties a day to settle the case, as prescribed by this section. In* such
case, upon proper affidavit, an order will be made to the judge to certify
a statement, but if the judge returns to such order that no application
to settle the case has been made, the appellant is without reined v. Kirkman v. Dixon, 66-406.
In an appeal to the supreme court, it is the duty of the appellant to cause
to be prepared a concise statement of the case, embodying the instructions
of the judge as signed by him, if there be any exceptions thereto, and
the requests of the counsel for instructions, if there be any exceptions
on account of the granting or withholding thereof, and stating sepa
rately, in articles numbered, the errors alleged. Sampson v. Railroad,
70-404; McNeill v. Chadbourne, 79-149.
Wherever there has been a departure from the law prescribed for pre
paring and sending up an appeal, and objection taken, the appeal will
be dismissed, and testimony will not be heard by the supreme court to
excuse the dep?rture. Adams v. Reeves, 74-106.
An appellant who merely prays an appeal in open court and files his
bond does not take an appeal within the meaning <jf the statute. Method
of perfecting an appeal considered. Wilson v. Seagle, 84-1 10.
It is the duty of the appellant to see that the case is so made out as to
present the points on which the judgment below is sought to be reviewed,
and if on the record there does not affirmatively appear that there was
error below, the judgment must be affirmed. Turner v. Foard, -83-683.
It is the duty of the appellant, after the service of the counter-case
on appeal by the appellee, to immediately request the judge to fix a
time and place for settling the case. If he fails to do so till after so
great a lapse of time that the judge is unable to remember what took
place at the trial, the judgment will be affirmed if there are no errors on
the face of the record proper; but if application is made within a rea
sonable time, and the judge is unable to settle the case on account of an
indistinct memory as to what took place at the trial a new trial will be
granted. Simmons v. Andrews, 106-201.
When the judge sustains exceptions filed by appellee to appellant's
statement of case on appeal, and directs the case thus modified, to be
redrafted and sent up, it is the duty of the appellant to have the case
redrafted and presented to the judge for signature. When he does not
do this, but merely sends up his statement of case, together with appel
lee's exceptions and the order of the judge, there is no "case settled on
appeal," and the court (if there are no errors on the face of the record
proper) may, on motion of appellee, or ex mero motu, either affirm the
judgment or remand the case. Mitchell v. Tedder, 107-358.
If no exceptions filed to case. —When the appellant's case on appeal is
served in time, and no exception or counter-case is served, it becomes
the "case on appeal." Booth v. RatclifTe, 107-6; Russell v. Davis, 99-115;
State v. Carlton, 107-956; Isler v. Haddock, 72-119.
If an appellant sends up with the case on appeal appellee's excep
tions thereto, which prove not to have been passed on by the judge who
settled the case, they will be considered as having been accepted by
appellant. Jones v. Call, 93-170.
Where counsel disagree as to a statement of the case, but, instead of
submitting it to the judge to settle, both send their statement up to the
supreme court, the appeal will not be dismissed, but it will be taken
that the appellant agreed to the modifications in his case, set out in
appellee's case. Owens v. Phelps, 92-231.
Appellant's case not served. —When the case on appeal is signed only by
the appellant's counsel, and there is nothing to show that it was served
on appellee in the time prescribed, it will not be considered in the
supreme court. Peebles v. Braswell, 107-68; Mfg. Co. v. Simmons, 97-S9.
When failure to settle case is without laches of appellant. —When the case
is not settled by the judge upon disagreement of counsel, a new trial
will \x granted only when there has been no laches on part of appellant.
Simmons v. Andrews, 106-201, and cases cited; Commissioners v. Steam
ship Co., 98-163.
Where it appears that the notes of the trial have been lost, and the
judge certifies that he cannot make up the case on appeal without them,
and the parties cannot agree on a statement of tbe case, and it further
appears that the appellant is in no default in perfecting his appeal, a
new trial will be granted. Isler v. Haddock, 72-119; Saunders v. Norris, 82-243; State v. Powers, 10-376; Burton v. Oreen, 94-215; Owens v.
Paxton, 106-480; Cleminons v. Archbell, 107-653.
It appearing that the case on appeal and the exceptions thereto were
delivered to the judge, who dies before it could be settled, that the papers
.have been lost; and that the defendant has been guilty of n0 laches, a
new trial is awarded. State v. Parks, 107-821. .
Appellee may withdraw counter case. —The appellant served his case on
appeal, and the appellee his counter case, both in proper time. The
judge took the papers to settle the case, but died before it was done.
The appellant moves in the supreme court for a new trial, because the
case has not bethi settled. The appellee asks to withdraw his case, and
leave the appellant's case to stand as the case on appeal: Held, the
appellee's motion should be allowed. Drake v. Connelly, 107-463.
Appellant entitled to have exceptions to charge incorporated. —The appellant
is entitled to have his assignments of error to the charge, and for refus
ing or granting special instructions, if set out by him in his statement
of case on appeal, incorporated by the judge in the case settled. If they
are omitted, certiorari will lie. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
If no request to judge to fix time and place. —When the appellant's coun
sel, on receipt of appellee's case, sends the papers to the judge to settle
the case on appeal without any "request," as required by The Code,
\ 550, to fix a time and place for settling the case, the judge is not required,
in the absence of such request, to give notice, and the case settled will
not be set aside in the supreme court, especially when appellant's coun
sel took no steps for three months towards securing a hearing before the
judge in the matter. Walker v. Scott, 106-56; State v. Williams, 109—.
"Case" found among files. —A case on appeal stated by the parties and
intended as a substitute for that prepared by the court, found among the
files of a case disposed of at former term of the supreme court, will not
be recognized in the absence of affirmative proof that it was adopted by
the court. Walton v. McKesson, 101-428.
If counsel agree on statement of case. —When counsel can agree upon a
statement of the case 0n appeal, both in criminal and civil actions, the
judge takes no part in its preparation; but when they cannot agree, the
judge settles the case on appeal, and does not merely adjust the differ
ences between the appellant's case and the specific objections filed by
the appellee. State v. Gooch, 94-982.
Counter case. — It is no objection to the exceptions filed by the appellee
to the appellant's case, that they are in the form of a counter case, and
not of specific objections. State v. Gooch, 94-982; Home v. Smith,
105-322.
If "case' not settled in time. —If, for any reason, the judge fails to settle
the case on appeal upon disagreement of counsel, in time to be docketed
in the supreme court at the next term, the appellant must bring up the
record in its imperfect state and have it docketed, and then move for the
proper orders to get the case on appeal before the supreme court, other
wise the appeal will be dismissed. Pitman v. Kimberly, 92-562; Bailey
v. Brown, 105-127.
Statement of case conclusive as to the facts. —Parties are concluded by the
facts contained in the statement of the case for the supreme court.
Therefore, when a defendant excepts to the report of a commissioner
because he did not report certain evidence, and the case shows that the
evidence was reported, his exception was properly overruled. Scbehaa
v. Malone, 71-144.
The record of a case on appeal certified to the supreme court must be
taken as imparting verity, and cannot be explained or contradicted by
matter dehors. An appellant is not entitled to a new trial, or to a man
damus commanding the judge to send up a correct statement of the case,
upon affidavit that the case as settled by the judge does not correctly set
forth the grounds of exception, He may apply for a certiorari. McDaniel v. King, 89-29.
Note. —See cases cited, 545, ante, as to requisites for certiorari im
such case.
Suggestions of counsel as to what occurred on the trial will not be
regarded. The court is confined to the consideration of the record.
Greenleaf v. Railroad, 91-33.
Where it appears that the appellant served no case on appeal, and the
court settled the case, it is presumed that he did so by consent of parties.
State v. Crook, 91-536.
Where it was stated in the record by the judge who settled the case
on appeal, that it was agreed that the court should make out the state
ment of the case without notice to counsel, the supreme court will take
it as true, and will not expunge the case from the transcript on the
affidavit of the appellee and his counsel that no such agreement was
made. McCoy v. Lassiter, 94-131.
Exceptions will not be heard in the supreme court as to the manner in
which the case on appeal was made up. State v. Starnes, 94-973; Tayloe
v. Steamship Co., 88-15.
The case on appeal must be accepted as conclusively true when made
out by the judge upon disagreement of counsel, and the supreme court
will not grant a certiorari to force the judge to make up a new case and
insert matters therein alleged by counsel to have been omitted. State
v. Miller, 94-902; State v. Gooch, 94-982; State v. Gay, 94-821.
The statement of the case on appeal by the court imports absolute
verity, and nothing will be heard to the contrary. Covington v. Xewberger, 99-523; State v. Debnam, 98-712.
A motion will not be entertained in the supreme court to allow an
appellant to file a record of proceedings subsequent to the appeal, and
independent of it, for the purpose of making a case here substantially
different from the one tried in the court below, nor will the case be
remanded for a like purpose. Whitehead v. Spivey, 103-66.
Remanded to settle case. —Where there had been two defendants, as to
one of whom a not. pros, was entered, and a verdict and judgment
against the other, who appealed and served a case on appeal upon plain
tiff's Counsel, and he having reason to believe that the attorney for the
not. prossed defendant was also attorney for the appellant, though such
was not the fact, served his counter-case on such attorney: Held, upon
motion, that it was proper to remand the case to be made up. Russell
v. Koouce, 102-485.
Where, upon disagreement, the case on appeal was settled by the
judge, who added to the case, "I do not remember distinctly what
occurred; I believe that this statement is correct; therefore I adopt it,"
it was remanded to the judge in order to settle the case again. Sim
mons v. Andrews, 104-127.
When counsel misunderstand terms of written agreement as to time
of settling the case on appeal, and there is reasonable ground for being
misled thereby, and the case, as served by appellant, is lost, the case
will be remanded, with leave to parties to serve case and counter-case
de novo, and, upon disagreement, case on appeal to be settled by the
judge, nunc pro tunc. Mitchell -v. Hoggard, 105-173.
What "case" should contain. —There can be but few cases where it can
be necessary or proper to set forth any of the evidence in a case settled
for the supreme court. One instance is where exceptions are taken in
the trial to the admissibility of evidence, in which case the exception is
made a part of the case, with so much of the evidence as may be mate
rial to the question to be raised. Another instance would probably be
the finding of a material fact by the court which is unsupported by any
evidence. With these, and perhaps a few other rare exceptions, the
supreme court, even if disposed to, cannot look into the voluminous
evidence which often encumbers the transcript of appeal. Armfield v.
Brown, 70-27.
The Code requires in all cases a statement of a "case" on appeal,
plainly stating the grounds of appeal, and arranged in convenient num
bered paragraphs; and these provisions must be complied with. McNeill
v. Chadbourne, 79-149; Sampson v. Railroad, 70-404.
A case on appeal should only contain matter explanatory of exceptions
taken. Surratt v. Crawford, 87-372; Green v. Collins, 28-139.
Only facts pertinent to the exceptions taken in the trial should be
stated in the case on appeal. All superflnous matter should be omitted.
Strickland v. Draughan, 88-315.
The rule that only such parts of the evidence should be set forth as
will enable the court to pass upon the exceptions made, reiterated by
the court. State v. Alston, 94-930.
Where exception is taken that the trial judge refused certain prayers
for instruction, the prayers for instruction and so much of the evidence
as bears upon them, should be set out in the case, and not merely a state
ment that the instructions asked were substantially given in the charge
to the jury. State v. Sloan, 97-499.
It is bad practice to send up the pleadings, motions, affidavits, orders,
etc., as the case on appeal, by agreement. Anthony v. Estes, 99-598.
Only so much of the charge as distinctly bears upon the specific
exception need be sent in the record. McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
Attention of trial judges called to evil of sending up superflnous and
unnecessary matter in the "case on appeal," especially when steno
graphic notes of evidence are taken. Durham v. Railroad, 108-399.
Where the facts set out are meagre and uncertain. —When the facts in a
case on appeal are so meagre and uncertain that the court cannot, in
justice to the parties, pass upon the question raised by the pleadings, a
new trial will be granted. Jones v. Shaw, 84-218.
Discrepancy between the record and the "case."—When there is a discrep
ancy between the record and the "case on appeal," the record controls.
State v. Keeter, 80-472; Adrian v. Shaw, 84-832; Farmer v. Willard,
75-401; McCanless v. Flinchum, 98-358; State v. Carlton, 107-956.
Where there is a conflict between the record and the case on appeal,
the record must prevail, but where matters are stated in the case, in
regard to which the record is silent, they will be accepted as facts.
McNeill v. Lawton, 97-16.
A memorandum of the clerk, evidently not made by the order of the
court, appearing in the record proper, will not be allowed to prevail over
a distinct statement of fact in the case on appeal. Bowen v. Fox, 99-127.
Where there is no statement of the case.—Where there is no statement of
the case accompanying the record, the judgment below is affirmed.
State v. Sheppard, 87-574.
Where no case is settled on appeal and no errors assigned in the
record, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Neal v. Mace,
89-171; Swepson v. Summey, 74-551; McDaniel v. Pollock, 87-503.
When no statement of the case accompanies the record, the judgment
will be affirmed, unless, upon inspection of the record, the court had no
jurisdiction or the complaint did not state a cause of action. Green t.
Dawson, 92-61.
When 110 statement of the case accompanies the transcript of the
record sent to the supreme court, and no error appears on the face of
the record, the judgment will be affirmed. State v. Freeman, 93-558.
Upon appeals to the supreme court, it will not affirm the judgment for
want of a statement of the case on appeal, where the errors appear suf
ficiently assigned in the record itself. Brooks v. Austin, 94-222.
An appeal will not be dismissed because there is no statement of the
case on appeal, because there may be error apparent on the face of the
record. The proper motion, if there be no error apparent on the record,
is to affirm the judgment. McCoy v. Lassiter, 94-31; Mfg. Co. v. Sim
mons, 97-89; Walker v. Scott, 102-487; Peebles v. Braswell, 107-68.
"Case" not necessary, when. —Where the record presents the exceptions
necessary to enable the court to pass upon them, 110 formal statement
of case is required. State v. Croop, 91-536; State v. Byrd, 93-624; Brooks
v. Austin, 94-222.
No case on appeal is necessary, when the case is tried in the court
below upon a case agreed, or on a demurrer. Chamblee v. Baker, 95-98.
Time counted from adjournment. — Until the term expires there is no final
determination of the cause, so that the case on appeal need only be filed
within five days after the end of the term at which judgment is ren
dered (now ten days, act 18S9, ch. 161). In calculating time within
which the case on appeal must be filed, the first day is to be excluded.
Turrentine v. Railroad, 92-642.
Appeals, in the legal sense, are not until the adjournment of the court;
up to that time the proceedings of the court are in fieri. Walker v.
Scott, 104-481.
Effect of amendatory act. —The statute (laws 1889, ch. 161) extending the
time to perfect appeals applied to appeals then pending and extended the
time of the appellee to file exceptions, as well as the time of the appel
lant to prepare and serve his case. Where, therefore, the appellant had
served his case after the time within which he might have done so under
the statute, as it stood originally, but within the ten days, as provided in
the act of 1889, and the appellee had no opportunity to file exceptions:
Held, that, although the appeal was saved by the act of 1S89, neverthe
less the appellee was entitled to the statutory period of five days in
which to file his counter-case. Walker v. Scott, 104-4S1; McGee v. Fox,
107-766.
Dispute as to sendee in time. —When it is claimed that a statement of
case on appeal was never properly served and should never have been
sent to the supreme court as part of the record, the proper course for the
objecting party is to move for a continuance there until he can apply to
the court below to strike the paper from the file. In that court the
record is made up for hearing in the supreme court on appeal. Walker
v. Scott, 102-487.
Former practice. —Under the practice, prevailing before the adoption
of the present procedure in relation to appeals, the trial judge, without
the intervention of the parties to the action, made up and stated the
case on appeal, and when filed and transmitted to the supreme court it
was treated as a part of the record; and where the record proper, and
the case on appeal—though the latter was not certified as a part of the
record—were in conflict in respect to a statement of the fact, the case
on appeal was allowed to prevail, the records of the supreme court con
taining some evidence that that court had proceeded in its decision
upon the statements therein made. Walton v. McKesson, 101-428.
Re-settlement of case. —A judge cannot re-seltle a case on appeal; he
can only correct such errors as have resulted from inadvertence, mis
take, misapprehension or the like. Boyer v. Teague, 106-571.
Case "settled" by the judge outside of the district. —An appeal will not he
dismissed because the statement of the case was made by the judge
below out of the district in which the action was tried, unless the record
shows that the appellee demanded to be present, and that by reason of
his absence he was prejudiced. Whiteside v. Williams, 66-141.
Note. —This section now provides for cases in which the judge may
settle a case on appeal outside of the district.
The absence of the judge from the district does not dispense with the
requirement that he should settle the case on appeal on disagreement of
counsel. Owens v. Phelps, 92-231.
Where the judge goes out of office —If, in case of an appeal, the judge
who presided at the trial below has gone out of office, and the papers
are lost, the only remedy is anew trial. Isler v. Haddock, 72-119;
Jones v. Holmes, 83-108.
When a defendant appealed to this court, and made out a statement
of the case, to which the plaintiff did not agree, and the presiding
judge, being notified of the disagreement, appointed a day to settle the
case, of which the parties had notice, but before he did settle the case
his term of office expired, and no case was sent up, the only remedy for
the defendant is a new trial. Mason v. Osgood. 72-120.
If there be a waiver of notice of appeal, and the parties fail to agree
upon a statement of the case upon appeal, and the presiding judge
goes out of office before settling the case, the only remedy is to remand
the case for a new trial. Adams v. Reeves, 74-106.
When a judge goes out of office without settling a case on appeal,
and the appellant has been in no default, a new trial will be granted.
Simonton v. Simonton, 80-7.
The appellant is not entitled to a new trial, when the judge goes out
of office without settling the case, if the appellant is guilty of any
laches. State v. Murray, 80-364.
Where a judge goes out of office before preparing a case on appeal, a
new trial will be awarded unless the parties agree upon a statement of
the case. The writ of certiorari applied for is granted to afford the
parties an opportunity to adjust their differences in the premises. Shelton v. Shelton, 8.9-185.
Note. —By amendment incorporated into the above section by The
Code of 1883. the judge who tries the case can now settle the case on
appeal, notwithstanding his having gone out of office.
Strict compliance with statute.—The court will require strict compliance
with the statute regulating appeals. Ignorance of the requirements or
a custom alleged in the court below not to insist on them is no excuse.
Hemphill v. Blackwelder, 90-14; Smith v. Abrams, 90-21.
Distinction between "case agreed" and "case stated."—Qu°erc, as to dis
tinction betwee a "case agreed" and a "case stated." Duval v. Rollins,
71-218.
When no case on appeal and no errors on face of record proper. — When there
is no case on appeal and no errors appear on the face of the record the
judgment will be affirmed. Swepson v. Summey, 74-551; Utley v. Foy,
70-303; Turner v. Foard, 83-683; State v. Orrell, 44-217; Fleming v.
Haicombe, 26-268; Royster v. Burwell, 90-25; Mott v. Ramsay, 90-29;
State v. Powell, 94-920; Rencher v. Anderson, 95-208; State v. Henry,
104-914.
Agreement of counsel not conclusive, when.—An agreement of counsel,
of record, that the constitutional requirement of twenty days was com
plied with before passage of a private act, is not conclusive. Gatlin v.
Tarboro, 78-119.
Where no errors are assigned. —Where, upon appeal, no errors are
assigned, and there is no error apparent upon the record, the judgment
of the court below will be affirmed. Swepson v. Summey, 74-551 ; Turner
1 v. Foard, 83-683; King v. Page, 86-725; Neal v. Mace, 89-171; Williams
v. Johnson, 94-633; State v. Gardner, 94-953; Pleasants v. Railroad, 95" 195; Justice v. Railroad, 96-412; Dupree v. Tuten, 97-94; Carroll v. Barden, 97-191; Wilson v. Shepherd, 9h-i54; Brendle v. I-Ierren, 98-539;

103-438; Taylor v. Plummer, 105-56; State v. Brown, 106-645.
Assignment of error not necessary, when. —No particular assignment of
error is necessary, when the appeal is taken from a judgment pronounced
on an agreed statement of facts. Davenport v. Leary, 95-203.
Or when the sole objection is for want of jurisdiction. Robeson v.
Hodges, 105-49.
Although there may be no formal assignment of error, the supreme
court will inspect the whole record and pronounce such judgment as in
law ought to have been rendered. Hutson v. Sawyer, 104-1.
Section 957 of The Code, requiring the supreme court to give such
judgment as shall appear to be proper from an inspection of the 'whole
record, has reference only to essential parts of the record proper, as
pleadings, verdict and judgment. McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
Except as to questions of jurisdiction and sufficiency of complaint to
constitute a cause of action, the supreme court will only consider ques
tions presented by the appeal, and this even though the parties should
agree that others should be passed upon. Davis v. Council, 92-725; Bank
v. Bobbin, 108-525.
See The Code, \ 967, and Rule 27 of the Supreme Court, post.
Exceptions.—It is the duty of the party appealing to specify the points
upon which he excepts to the ruling of the court below. Stout v. Woody,
63-37Parties who appeal from rulings below in regard to the evidence, must
set forth, in distinct terms, the evidence rejected, so that the court may
pass upon its admissibility. Bland v. O'Hagan, 64-471.
It is a rule of the supreme and all other courts of error, that an excep
tion will not be considered which does not specifically and distinctly
point out the error alleged, and show wherein the error is conceived to
consist. Brumble v. Brown, 71-513.
It is the duty of the appellant objecting to rejected evidence, to show
that it was competent and proper. Sutliff v. Lunsford, 30-31S; Whilesides v. Twitty, 30-431; Straus v. Beardsley, 79-59; State v. Keath. 83-626.
Where a ease 0n appeal does not disclose the grounds of the appel
lant's exceptions, the supreme court will affirm the judgment below, not
because it is thought to be right, but because it cannot be seen to be
wrong. Chasteen v. Martin, 84-391.
An exception, to be available on appeal, must point out specifically the
error of which complaint is made. Moore v. Hill, 85-218; Strickland v.
Draughan, 88-315; Arrington v. Goodrich, 95-462.
Exception only lies to the reply elicited by a question, and not a ques
tion which is unanswered. Bost v. Bost, 87-477.
Where objection to evidence is not taken in apt time below, it cannot
be raised on appeal. Shields v. Whitaker, 82-516.
See \ 412 (2), and cases there citeiV
An exception to the entire charge of the judge to the jury, without
specifically pointing out the alleged error, will not be entertained. Host
t. Bost, 87-477; McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
See \ 412 (3), and numerous cases there cited.
Where the contents of a paper excluded from the evidence are not set
out in the case on appeal, but the substance of it appears as stated by
counsel when offering it, this is sufficient to enable the court to pass
upon the exception. State v. Pierce, 91-606.
The court reiterates the rule that no exceptions will be considered
on appeal, except such as appear in the record, and were made in the
court below. Phipps v. Pierce, 94-514; Calvert v. Miller, 94-600; Rod
man v. Harvey, 102-1; Lindsay v. Sauderlin, 104-331.
It is the duty of the party excepting to show the error excepted to,
and to state such of the evidence as is necessary to enable the supreme
court to comprehend and decide the point. When the record does not
contain such evidence, the supreme court cannot review the decision of
superior court, but will affirm it. Williams v. Whiting. 92-683.
Every presumption is made in favor of the correctness of the judg
ment in the court below. So, where it appeared from the record that
the judgment was rendered on the verdict and the admissions of the
parties, but no admissions appeared in the records, it will be presumed
the admissions would warrant the judgment, and it will be affirmed.
Rencher v. Anderson. 95-208.
Where it appears from the record that the issues were not eliminated
in writing and submited to the jury, but simply "that the jury found
all issues in favor of the plaintiff," a new trial will not be granted,
unless objection was taken at the trial. Lamb v. Sloan, 94-534. See
>.? 395, 396, 397 and 398, ante.
Where the plaintiff does not object to the counterclaim on account of
the imperfect pleading, the supreme court, on appeal, will consider the
issues which were tried on it in the court below. Smith v. McGregor,
96-ior.
Where the pendency of another action, and a judgment therein which
disposes of the subject-matter of the controversy in the new suit, is not
regularly pleaded, but is taken advantage of by an exception, the
informality is such that the supreme court will not pass on the question,
but will remand the case that the fact may be regularly ascertained.
Holley v. Holley, 96-229.
If there be error in such matters as are not necessarily of the record,
the court will not see and correct it, unless it be assigned. (Report of
State v. Reynolds, 95-616, adverted to as incorrect and misleading.)
Thornton v. Brady, 100-38.
A party to the record cannot assign as error that an order made in the
cause affects injuriously the rights of third persons who are not parties.
Coates v. Wilkes, 94-174.
Where exceptions are vague and indefinite, or where they are based
upon an alleged want of evidence, but do not point to the evidence
itself, but compel the appellate court to search for it in the entire evi
dence sent up, they will not be considered. Wiley v. Logan. 95-358.
When there is a motion for a new trial below for a refusal to give
instructions asked, this is sufficient assignment .of error. Taylor v.
Plummer, 105-56, cited and distinguished. Everett v. Williamson,
107-204.
The practice as to exceptions summarized and stated. —The practice in
•statements of exceptions summarized and fully stated. Taylor v. Plum
mer, 105-56. See rule 27 of the supreme court, post'.
Exceptions made in the supreme court for the first time. —Where an appel
lant elects to carry a case from the probate court to the judge in vaca
tion, it is still within the discretion of the latter to hear it in term time,
and vice versa. Iu case of such an appeal, if there be a further appeal
from the judge to the supreme court, the latter tribunal can review no
point before the probate court that was not passed up in by the judge.
Rowland v. Thompson, 64-714.
An exception cannot be made for the first time in the supreme court.
Sampson v. Railroad, 70-404; Turner v. Turner, 104-566.
No error can be assigned in supreme court on appeal which was not
assigned in court below, except (i) want of jurisdiction in the court that
tried the case; (2) that the complaint does not contain a sufficient cause
of action. Williamson v. Canal Company. 78-156; Meekinsv. Tatem,
79-546; Stout v. Moody, 63-37; Bank v. Graham, 82-481; Corbin v.
Berry, 83-27; Wellons v. Jordan, 83-371; State v. Langford, 44-436:
King v. King, 20-164.
No exception can be taken in the supreme court that was not taken
below. State v. Secrest, 80-450; McMinn v. Hamilton, 77-300; Devereux v. Deverenx, 81-12; White v. Clark, 82-6; Whisenhunt v. Jones,
80-348; State v. Hardee, 8.;-6i9.
Not even a variance between allegation and proof unless urged below.

liams v. Kivett. 82-110.
Exceptions not apparent on the face of the record, and which ought
to have been taken on the trial below, will not be heard for the first
time on appeal. Whisenhunt v. Jones, 80-348.
Where proceedings to obtain the construction of a will are commenced
before the superior court clerk or judgi of probate, and then trans
ferred to the superior court in term for adjudication, the decision of the
judge of the superior court rendered without objection will not be
reversed 011 appeal by reason of a defect of jurisdiction first urged in
the supreme court. Houston v. Howie, 84-349.
Where the facts of a case are to be passed upon by the judge, his
failure to find upon an issue claimed to be raised by the pleadings is not
assignable for error, unless the judge was requested at the trial to pass
upon such issue, or his failure to do so was then called to his attention.
Bryant v. Fisher. 85-71.
A new trial will not be granted by the supreme court for a variance
between the allegation and the proof, where no exception is taken in
the court below. The presumption is, that every fact necessary to sus
tain the verdict was proved 0n the trial. State v. Craige, 89-475.
The supreme court will not consider an exception which was not taken
in the court below. State v. Craige, 89-475: State v. Jones, 69-16: State
v. Potter, 61-388; State v. Cowan, 29-239; Mfg. Co. v. Brooks, 106-107.
Objection to the issues cannot be taken for the first time on appeal.
Porter v. Railroad, 97-66: Kirk v. Railroad, 97-82; McDonald v. Carson,
95-377; Phifer v. Alexander, 97-335. See \ 395, ante.
The objection that a judgment on a demurrer is final, and not that the
defendant answer over, cannot be made for the first time in the supreme
court. Moore v. Nowell, 94-265.
Where, in the supreme court, a reference is made to the clerk to
state an account, an exception will not be heard upon a motion to con
firm the report, which was not taken in the court below, nor on the first
hearing in this court. Although such exceptions cannot be taken, yet
if the court can see from the report, that it acted under a misapprehen
sion of the facts in the first hearing, it will, ex mero motu, modify its
ruling, when it is plain that it will work great injustice. Depriest v.
Patterson, 94-519.
Where a judge at one term of the court strikes out a judgment made
at a former term and substitutes another in its stead, this could not be
assigned as error in the supreme court for the first time, there being no
exception to the action of the court entered at the time. Cowles v.
Curry, 96-331.
The objection of the want of jurisdiction, or that the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, may be made in
the supreme court for the first time, although no error whatever is
assigned in the record. Mfg. Co. v. Simmons, 97-89.
Upon appeal the court will pass upon the question, whether or not the
facts admitted by the pleadings constitute a plea in bar, although such
question was not passed upon directly by the court below. Woody v.
Brooks, 102-334.
The court will not consider any exceptions not set out in the "case
on appeal," other than exception to the jurisdiction, or because com
plaint does not state a cause of action, or to the sufficiency of an
indictment. Rule 27, and The Code, # 550; McKinnon v. Morrison,
io4-354; Taylor v. Plummer, 105-56; Walker v. Scott, 106-56; Whitehurst v. Pettipher, 105-40.
The defendant will not be allowed, for the first time in the supreme
court, to raise questions as to whether plaintiff offered sufficient evidence
to go to the jury to show the sufficiency of his possession. McMillan
v. Gambill, 106-359.
Contra. —Where the judge, in response to a request for instructions,
or, of his own accord, misdirects the jury upon a materia1 question of
law, to the injury of the appellee, and the error is patent upon the
record, such error is open to correction, though pointed out for the first
time in the supreme court. Burton v. Railroad, 84-192; Bynum v.
Bynum, 33-632.
Note. —These two decisions are opposed to the entire line of decisions
(since formulated into Rule 27 of the Supreme Court, post), and cannot
be now considered as authority. So much depends upon the context
that ordinary fairness to the appellee requires that an exception to the
charge should be made, at the latest, in stating case on appeal, so that
all the charge and evidence bearing on the exception should be sent up.
McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354; Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718, and numerous
other cases. Under the Rules of the Supreme Court (Rule 22), and
repeated decisions, the "statement of the case" on appeal should only
contain matters pertinent to exceptions made below and sent up to be
reviewed, and should not be incumbered with anything unnecessary for
that purpose.
See §412 (3), ante, and cases there cited.
Note. —For former practice on appeal, see Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp.
1017-1026, and vol. 3, pp. 518, 519.
Exceptions made after verdict. —Exceptions taken after verdict, to issues,
to evidence, or to the charge, will not be entertained. Tayloe v. Steam
ship Co., SS-15.
Note. —It is otherwise now as to the charge, as exceptions thereto may
be made as late as statement by appellant of his case on appeal, but not
later. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
Eurden upon appellant to show error. —All intendments are taken most
strongly against a party alleging error on the record; therefore, where
the defendant confessed judgment before a justice on a note given to
the plaintiff as administrator for the rent of a house, and then appealed
and objected in the superior court that the plaintiff had no right of
action: Held, on appeal to the supreme court, the record showing noth
ing to the contrary, that it must be presumed that the plaintiff's intes
tate had an estate for years, and not an inheritable estate in the premises.
Rush v. Steamboat Co., 67-47.
The burden is upon the appellant to show that the judgment below is
in error. Oldham v. Kerchner, 79-106; Utley v. Foy, 70-303.
Where it is sought to enjoin the collection of a judgment on the
ground of want of jurisdiction in the court which rendered it, every
presumption is in favor of the jurisdiction, and it must be made to
appear affirmatively from the record that the court had no jurisdiction.
Neville v. Pope, 95-346.
The presumption is in favor of the regularity and correctness of the
the proceedings below, and error will not be presumed unless it is
assigned and shown. Lyle v. Siler, 103-261; State v. Debnam, 98-712.
Immateriality of error complained of. —The immateriality of an error, on
the trial below, must clearly appear on the face of the record in order to
warrant the court in disregarding it. McLenan v. Chisholm, 64-323.
The supreme court will not review a ruling of law which does not affect
the party, even if erroneous. Butts v. Screws, 95-215; Nissen v. Mining
Co., 104-309.
It is incumbent on the appellant to show that, by a reception of imma
terial or incompetent evidence, he was probably prejudiced. Glover v.
Flowers, 101-134; McGowan v. Railroad, 95-417; Livingston v. Dunlap,
99-268.
Where the jury gave substantial damages, which are affirmed on
appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the charge given as to nominal
damages. Thompson v. Telegraph Co., 107-449.
Motion to dismiss appeal, when to be made. — A motion to dismiss an appeal
for irregularity may be made when the cause is called for trial, though
it may have been on docket a previous term and continued for want of
time to trv it. Hutchison v. Rumfelt, 82-425; Chastain v. Chastain,
87-283.
See Rules of Supreme Court, No. 16, post.
Motion to dismiss will be refused, when. —A motion to dismiss an appeal
because it does not appear that a case had been made and served as
prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure will not be granted when
opposing counsel states on oath in this court that all the requirements
of the Code were complied with in the court below. Kirk v. Barnhart,
74-653A defect in the name of a defendant in the summons is cured by a
judgment by default rendered against him. When such judgment is
taken before a justice of the peace and carried by appeal to the superior
court, it is the duty of the court to make the proper amendment and
proceed with the trial upon the merits. But when the defendant in such
case took an appeal from the justice, and failed, for seven terms, to make
any motion to dismiss, he thereby waived the irregularity complained of.
Clawson v. Wolfe, 77-100.
An appeal will not be dismissed if the record or " the case " clearly
discloses the grounds of appeal, though not very formally made. Allen
v. Griffin, 98-120.
Appeal dismissed ex niero motn. —The supreme court will examine the
entire record upon an appeal, and if it appears therefrom that no suffi
cient cause of action is stated, it will, ex mero motn, dismiss the appeal.
Knowles v. Railroad, 102-59; Peacock v. Stott, 104-154; Norris v. McLarn,
104-159; Hagins v. Railroad, 106-537.
•
Where, upon the inspection of the whole record, it appears that the
judgment was unwarranted upon the facts, the supreme court will, ex
mero motu, reverse it. Everett v. Raby, 104-479.
Amendments in appellate court. —In cases of appeal from the probate
court to the superior court, the judge has the same right to allow amend
ments as if the case had been constituted in his court. Amendments
which promote justice and a trial on the merits, are, in general, liberally
allowed; but, in all cases, the application should be made in due time,
or sufficient reason be shown for the delay. Sudderth v. McCombs, 67353.
Where it is agreed in the court below, that a complaint may be
amended so as to supply necessary averments, but it is not done, the
supreme court will allow the amendment to be filed in that court. Hines
v. Railroad, 95-434.
Where an action on an administration bond was brought in the name
of the administrator de bonis non, and not in that of the state on his rela
tion, an amendment making the proper plaintiff will be allowed in the
supreme court, without terms, although the objection was not taken
below, and was n.ade for the first time on appeal. Grant v. Rogers,
94-755.
A motion to strike out a counterclaim, because the court did not have
jurisdiction of it, can be allowed when made for the first time in the
supreme court. McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354.
See \ 273, ante, The Code, \ 965, and Rule 26 of the Supreme Court.
Issues of fact reviewed. —The supreme court can only review and pass
on issues of fact in certain cases, and then only when the evidence on
which the finding in the court below was based, is set out fully and at
large in the record. Runnion v. Ramsay, 93-410; Worthy v. Shields,
90-192; Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376; Young v. Rollins, 90-125.
Where pleadings are confused.—When pleadings are so confused and
vague as to leave it in doubt what the parties are contending over, the
supreme court will not take cognizance of the cause on appeal. Woodlief v. Merritt, 96-226.
Appeal when no judgment rendered. —Although an appeal before any judg
ment is rendered below is premature, and will be dismissed, yet, when
it appears that a decision of the supreme court of the point intended to
be raised by the appeal will practically terminate the action, the opinion
of the court may be given. State v, Nash, 97-514; Railroad v. Reids»ille, 101-404; State v. Divine, 98-778; Thornton v. Lambeth, 103-86.
Stipulations as to other cases.—The supreme court will not take notice
of and act upon a stipulation as to other cases turning upon the princi
ples applicable to the case before it. Rawlings v. Hunt, 90-270.
Effect of appeal. —An appeal arrests all proceedings in the court below
upon the judgment appealed from. Skinner v. Bland, S7-16S; Isler ».
Brown, 69-125.
But does not withdraw from it authority to order proper security to be
given for the safe keeping or investment of a fund ordered by the judg
ment to be distributed. The supreme court will not entertain an appli
cation to make disposition of the fund by investment pending the appeal.
Hinson v. Adrian, 91-372.
While a supreme court may take notice of an appeal as soon as it is
perfected in the court below, for the purpose of bringing it up, it is not
properly pending in the supreme court, until it has been docketed.
Avery v. Pritchard, 93-266.
An appeal does not take the case beyond the control of the superior
court, until it is perfected. Coates v. Wilkes, 94-174.
It is where the judgment is final and disposes of the entire contro
versy, that the appeal, when properly perfected, vacates the judgment
and the whole cause is transferred to the appellate court. Even then, it
may, for some purposes, be proceeded with in the lower court. Green v.
Griffin, 95-50.
Note. —The judgment is not vacated no\\, but merely suspended by
the appeal. Acts 1887, ch. 192.
As a general rule, the supreme court, in the exercise of its appellate
functions, cannot acquire jurisdiction of a cause and the parties thereto
until a proper transcript has been brought up and duly docketed therein.
Walton v. McKesson, 101-428.
After the lapse of time within which the appellant should docket his
appeal in the supreme court, if he fails to do so, the superior court may,
on proper notice, adjudge the appeal abandoned, and proceed as if it
had not been taken. Avery v. Pritchard, 93-266, approved; Fisher v.
Mining Co., 105-123.
Sec. SSI. Clerk to make copy of judgment-roll and ttend to
clerk of supreme court. C. C. P., a. 302. JSSU, c. 13!>.
The clerk, on receiving a copy of the case settled, as
required in the preceding section, shall make a copy of the
judgment-roll and of the case, and, within twenty days,
transmit the same, duly certified, to the clerk of the supreme
court. Clerks of the superior court, except in cases where
parties are allowed to appeal without giving an undertaking
on appeal, shall not be required to make the copy of the
record in the case for the supreme court until the appellant
shall have given the undertaking on appeal or made the
deposit required.
Notk. —The last paragraph was added by ch. 135, acts 1S89.
Duty of clerk to send up transcript. — If a clerk fails to send up the tran
script in time, a certiorari lies. Howerton v. Henderson, 86-718.
The duties prescribed for the clerk of the superior court in respect to
making and transmitting transcripts of records upon appeals are minis
terial, and he has no authority to pass upon the question whether the
appeal has been perfected. Russell v. Davis, 99-115.
It is the duty of the clerk, within twenty days after the case on appeal
is filed in his office, to send up a transcript to the supreme court (The
Code, \ 551), but not unless his fees are paid by the appellant. Semble,
that leave to appeal in forma pauperis does not excuse appellant from
paying costs of transcript. Bailey v. Brown, 105-127; Andrews v. Whisnant, 83-446.
See Rules 11 and 12 of the Superior Courts, post.
Duty of appellant. —It is the duty of the appellant, and not of the clerk,
to have the record sent to the supreme court. So, where the case on
appeal was filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court a short
time before the term of the supreme court to which it should have been
brought expired, but the transcript was not docketed until during
the next term, the appeal was dismissed, although the appellant had
applied for a certiorari at the term at which his appeal should have been
docketed. Pittman v. Kimberly, 92-562.
Before the supreme court will entertain an appeal, the appellant must
cause to be properly filed and docketed therein a duly certified transcript
of the record of the action in the court where the judgment sought to
be reviewed was rendered. This transcript must show that the court
from which the appeal was taken was lawfully organized and held, and
all the proceedings had in the action arranged in an orderly manner.
State v. Preston, 104-733.
Transcript made out by directions of appellant. —It is the right and duty
of an appellant, subject to the provisions of The Code, to direct what
part of the record shall be sent up. Only so much should be sent up as
will show that there was a case duly constituted in court, and the ver
dict, judgment and such portions of the proceedings, evidences and
instructions of the judge as will enable the court to pass on the excep
tions. Sudderth v. McCombii, 67-353; Bryan v. Moring, 99-16.
It is the duty of the appellant to have so much of the record sent up
as may be necessary to present clearly the matters which he desires to
have reviewed, and he cannot take advantage of any defect in the tran
script for failure to set out the case intelligibly. Smith v. Kite, 98-517.
Transcript delayed in transit. —Where the transcript of the record was
deposited in the post-office in ample time to have reached the supreme
court before entering on the call of the calendar of the district to which
the case belonged, but, by some delay in the mails, did not reach its
destination until after the time for docketing: Held, that the excuse was
reasonable, and the appeal would not be dismissed. Walker v. Scott,
104-481.
Two transcripts sent up, when.— When both parties appeal, there are two
cases constituted in the supreme court, and two complete transcripts
must be made out and transmitted by the clerk. Morrison v. Cornelins,
63-346; Perry v. Adams, 96-347; Jones v. Hoggard, 107-349.
If transcript Imperfect. —When the record of a case brought upon appeal
to the supreme court is imperfect, the case will be remanded to the court
below. Bradley v. Jones, 76-204; Gordon v. Sanderson, 83-1; Markham
t. Hicks, 90-1; Bethea v. Byrd, 93-141.
When the transcript fails to show that the cause was properly consti
tuted below, the cause will be remanded. Bradley v. Jones, 76-204;
Markham v. Hicks, 90-1.
An appeal to the supreme court will be dismissed when the transcript
of the record fails to show that a court was held, or that a grand jury
presented the indictment, and when it appears from the case on appeal
that the grounds on which the defendant appealed are frivolous. State
v. McDowell, 93-541; State v. Johnston, 93-559.
When the transcript does not show that any court was held, or that
any judge was present or gave judgment, it is so defective that the
supreme court has no jurisdiction to act upon it. Broadfoot v. McKeithan, 92-561.
If transcript is a set of loose, disconnected papers, the case will be
remanded. State v. Jones, 82-691 ; State v. Guilford, 49-8-5; Goff v. Pope,
82-696.
See cases cited Under the preceding section—subheads. " What tran
script should contain," and "If transcript defective."
Recital in transcript. —Where the record recites that a regular term of
a superior court was opened and held Wednesday instead of Monday, of
the week fixed by the statute, it will be presumed that the sheriff had
duly opened the court and adjourned it from day to day, as provided in
The Code, \ 926. State v. Weaver, 104-758.
Conflict between record and statement of case. —When the "statement of
the case," or any part thereof, on an appeal to the supreme court, con
flicts with the record proper, the latter must prevail, because it imports
absolute verity. The "statement of the case" is not a part of the
record proper. Farmer v. Willard, 75-401; State v. Keener, 80-472;
Adrian v. Shaw, 84-832; McCandless v. Flinchum, 98-358; State v.
Carlton, 107-956; McNeill v. Lawton, 97-16.
Form of transcript recommended by the court. —It is recommended that
the transcript of record, on appeal, be drawn in accordance with Eaton's
Forms. When the transcript is imperfect the court, of its own motion,
may order a certiorari to issue. State v. Butts, 91-524.
Sec. 552. On appeal security must be given or deposit made,
unless waived. C. C. P., s. 303. 1871-'2, c. 31, s. 1. 1S87,
c. 102, s. 1. 1880, c. 135, s. 2.
To render an appeal effectual for any purpose in any civil
cause or special proceeding, a written undertaking must be
executed on the part of the appellant, with good and suffi
cient surety, in such sum as may be ordered by the court,
not to exceed the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, to
the effect that the appellant will pay all costs which may
be awarded against him on the appeal ; or such sum as may
be ordered by the court must be deposited with the clerk
by whom the judgment or order was entered, to abide the
event of the appeal ; such undertaking or deposit may be
waived by a written consent on the part of the respondent.
The stay of execution provided for in this title shall not
be construed to vacate the judgment appealed from, but in
all cases said judgment shall remain in full force and effect,
and the lien of said judgment shall remain unimpaired not
withstanding the giving of the undertaking or making the
deposit required, until the judgment appealed from is
reversed or modified by the supreme court.
Amendment
No appeal shall be dismissed in the supreme court on
the grouna that the undertaking on appeal was not filed
earlier or the deposit made earlier : Provided, the under
taking shall be filed or such deposit made before the record
of the case is transmitted by the clerk of the superior court
to the supreme court. And when no undertaking on appeal
has been filed or deposit made before the record in the case
is transmitted to the supreme court, the supreme court may,
in its discretion, thereafter allow, on such terms as may
seem best, the appellant to file an undertaking 0n appeal
or make the deposit
Appeal bond must be filed within ten days. —The undertaking necessary to
perfect an appeal must be given within a reasonable time after notice
of the appeal has been given. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
An appellant, if not allowed by the court to appeal without security,
must file his appeal bond at the term at which the case was tried, or the
appeal will be dismissed. State v. Hawkins, 72-180.
The appeal bond must be filed within ten days after the rendition of
the judgment, unless waived by agreement of counsel appearing of
record. If not filed in that time, or waived, the appeal will be dis
missed. Wade v. Newbern, 72-498; Taylor v. Brower, 78-8; Sever v.
McLaughlin, 82-332; Brown v. Williams, 83-684; Applewhite v. Fort,
85-596; Boyden v. Williams, 92-546.
Unless a complete appeal bond is filed within the ten days, the case
will be dismissed. The filing of a bond within the ten days with only
one surety and unjustified, but which is after the ten days signed by
another surety and justified, is not sufficient. Smith v. Reeves, 85-594.
Ten days after adjournment of court.—The ten days within which the
undertaking on appeal must be filed, are not counted from the day on
which the judgment is rendered, but from that on which the court
adjourned. Turrentine v. Railroad, 92-642; Chamblee v. Baker, 95-98;
Worthy v. Brady, 91-265; Walker v. Scott, 104-481.
Under act 1887, ch. 121. —A motion to dismiss because of imperfections
in the undertaking on appeal, will not be entertained, unless the pro
visions of ch. 121, laws 1887, are complied with. Jones v. Slaughter,
96-541.
A failure to execute and file an undertaking on appeal within the
time prescribed by law, is not a mere "irregularity," and hence amotion
to dismiss the appeal for such failure does not require the twenty days'
notice, as provided by the act of 1887, ch. 121. Harmon v. Herudon,
99-477; Bowen v. Fox, 98-396.
The omission of the proper penal sum in an undertaking on appeal
will not be considered such a fatal mistake as to authorize the court to dis
miss the appeal in the absence of the notice required by the act of 1887,
ch. 121; nor will the omission of the clerk to insert in the transcript of
the record the fact that the appeal was taken, if it appears in the case
on appeal. Allison v. Whittier, 101-490.
An error in the recital in an undertaking on appeal, of the rendition
of the judgment from which the appeal is taken, will not authorize a
dismissal of the appeal; and such error may be remedied under the
provisions of the act of 1887, ch. 121. Lackey v. Pearson, 101-651.
A motion to dismiss appeal for insufficient bond will not be enter
tained, unless after written notice, as required by ch. 121, acts of
1887. McGee v. Fox, 107-766.
See I 560, post, with the amendment of acts 1887, ch. 121.
Under acts 1889, ch. 135.—While the statute passed at the recent (1889)
session of the general assembly provides that the supreme court may
allow an undertaking on appeal to be filed in that court, the power thus
conferred will not be exercised unless the appellant shows a reasonable
excuse for his failure to give the undertaking within the time prescribed
by The Code, >A 549, 552. Harrison v. Hoff, 102-25.
An appeal will not be dismissed where the undertaking was not filed
in the prescribed time, if filed before the transcript of the record was
sent to supreme court. Howertou v. Sexton (acts 1889, c. 135, s. 1),
104-75; Graves v. Hines, 106-323.
Where delay is caused by absence of clerk. —Where, upon a motion to
dismiss an appeal on the ground that the undertaking was not filed in
time, it appears that the appeal was taken in good faith, and the failure
to file the undertaking in time was caused by the clerk of the superior
coujt being absent from his office, the motion will be denied. Jones v.
Wilson, 103-13.
Presumptive date of filing. — Nothing to the contrary appearing, it will
be presumed that an undertaking on appeal was filed at the date of the
justification. It is, however, competent to show that it was filed at
another time. Harmon v. Ilerndon, 99-477.
Failure by neglect of party. — If an appellant fails to perfect his appeal
by his own negligence or that of his agent, he loses it entirely. It is
not the duty of counsel to file an appeal bond, and when the appellant
loses his appeal by failure of counsel to comply with his promise to file
such, this is the neglect of a mere agent, and the appeal cannot be rein
stated. Winborn v. Byrd, 92-7; Churchill v. Ins. Co., 92-485; approved
in Griffin v. Nelson, 106-235.
Where no bond was given. — Where no appeal bond is given and there is
no affidavit of inability to give bond, the appeal will be dismissed. State
v. Walker, 82-696; State v. Patrick, 72-217; State v. Donaldson, 83-683;
State v. Spurtiu, 80-362.
A motion to dismiss an appeal for want of an appeal bond comes too
late after argument. Yancey v. Greenlee, 90-317.
Where an appeal without bond or affidavit was allowed " by consent,"
it was held not to be in compliance with law. State v. Kerns, 90-650.
Deposit in lien of bond. —The clerk has no authority to accept any sub
stitute for the undertaking on appeal, or deposit of money in lien thereof,
provided by the statute. Eshon v. Com'rs, 95-75.
When the appellant deposited with the clerk, a bond due to himself,
and secured by a mortgage, as a substitute for the undertaking on appeal,
this was not a compliance with the statute, and the appeal should be
dismissed. Ibid,
Qiuzre, whether an appellant can execute a mortgage on real property
in lien of a justified undertaking on appeal, under the provisions of The
Code, \ 117; but even if this be so, the statute must be strictly followed.
Ibid.
A sufficient bond substituted for an insufficient one. —The supreme court
may allow an appellant to substitute a sufficient for an insufficient
appeal bond, after a motion by the appellant to dismiss the appeal for
such defect. Robeson v. Lewis, 64-734.
Appeal bond invalid. —An appeal bond made payable to the state is void.
Dorsey v. Railroad, 91-201.
But an undertaking is valid though it may not recite which party
appealed. Chamblee v. Baker, 95-98.
Co-defendant not appealing, sufficient surety. —Where the judgment is
against only one defendant, and the appeal bond is signed by both, the
latter is sufficient surety under the statute. Symc v. Badger, 91-272.
Undertaking must be sent up with transcript. —On an appeal to the supreme
court, an undertaking of appeal must be sent up with the transcript.
Felton v. Elliott, 66-195.
Undertaking secures costs of appellee, not of appellant. —An undertaking
on appeal, given under this section, though not so expressed, is, by
implication, taken to be made with the appellee. Such undertaking
secures the costs of the appellee, but not those of the appellant. There
fore, when there was judgment in the supreme court in favor of the
appellant, his sureties are not liable on their undertaking for his costs
when such costs cannot be made out of the appellee or their principal.
Office v. Huffsteller, 67-449; Morris v. Morris, 92-142.
Waiver. —Where the case states "bond fixed at $25 and approved" by
the judge, the acquiescence and waiver of objection by the appellee will
be assumed. Hancock v. Bramlett. 85-393; Gruber v. Railroad, 92-1.
The failure to justify the appeal bond is waived, if, subsequent to its
being filed, the appellee agrees to and signs the appellant's statement
of the case on appeal. Howerton v. Henderson, 86-718.
The requirements of this section are not directory, but mandatory, and
can only be dispensed with by a written waiver on the part of the appel
lee. Harshaw v. McDowell, 89-181; State v. Wagner, 91-521.
Supersedeas pending decision as to sufficiency of the bond. —To stay proceed
ings, pending the review of a decision of the clerk in regard to the suf
ficiency or insufficiency of an undertaking on appeal, a supersedeas is
the proper mode, and not an injunction. Salisbury v. Cohen, 68-289.
Appellant bound without signing the undertaking. —It is not necessary to
bind the appellant that he should sign the undertaking. Walkter v. Wil
liams, 88-7.
New bond on second appeal. —Where an appeal has been dismissed and a
judgment for costs entered against the appellant and the sureties on his
appeal bond, if another appeal is taken a new bond must be filed.
Spence v. Tapscott, 93-250.
Clerk of supreme court can require his fees. —The clerk of the supreme
court is not bound to render his services gratuitously to a party whom
the judge of the court below has allowed to appeal without giving the
bond required by law. Martin v. Chasteen, 75-96; Bailey v. Brown,
105-127.
In criminal cases. —An appeal to this court in a criminal action, without
bond, must be perfected, as prescribed by the act of i86o-'7o, ch. 196,
during the term of the court. If noj. so perfected, it is a nullity, and
cannot vacate or suspend the judgment of the court. State v. Dixon,
71-204. Otherwise now by acts 1889, ch. 161. See next section.
In criminal cases, a defendant cannot appeal without security, unless
he makes affidavit that he is advised by counsel that he has reasonable
cause for appeal, and that his appeal is in good faith. The superior
court has no right to allow such appeal merely for delay. State v. Mor
gan, 77-510. See cases cited under next section.
Sec. 653. Appeal in forma pauperis. 187S-'4, c. HO. 18S!),
c. 161.
When any party to a civil action tried and determined in
the superior court shall, at the time of trial, desire an appeal
from the judgment rendered in said action to the supreme
court, and shall be unable, by reason of his poverty, to
make the deposit or to give the security required by law
for said appeal, it shall be the duty of the judge or clerk
of said superior court to make an order allowing said party
to appeal' from said judgment to the supreme court, as in
other cases of appeal, without giving security therefor:
Provided, that the party desiring to appeal from said judg
ment shall, within five days, make affidavit that he is
unable, by reason of his poverty, to give the security
required by law for said appeal, and that said party is
advised by counsel learned in the law that there is error in
matter of law in the decision of the superior court in said
action: Providedfurther, that said affidavit shall be accom
panied by a written statement from a practising attorney of
said superior court that he has examined the affiant's case,
and that he is of opinion *that the decision of the superior
court in said action is contrary to law: Provided, that the
appeal, when passed upon and granted by the clerk, shall
he within ten days from^the expiration by law of said term
of court.
Note. —The words " or clerk," in line six, and "within five days," in
line eleven, and also the last proviso, were added to this section by ch.
161, acts 1889.
Powers of the judge. —A judge of the superior court has no power to
permit an appeal in forma pauperis, and such an appeal will be dis
missed. Mitchell v. Sloan, 69-10.
Note.—Otherwise now by the above section (acts 1873-'4).
An appeal in forma pauperis must be perfected during the term at
which the judgment was rendered. The court has no power to allow
the party praying such appeal time in which to file his affidavit of
inability to give bond as required by law. Stell v. Barham, 85-88.
Note.—Otherwise now by amendment as above (1889, ch. 161).
Effect of order granting leave to appeal in forma pauperis. —Administrators
and all others, parties to the record, prosecuting or defending, are per
mitted, upon complying with this section, to appeal to the supreme
court without giving surety therefor. Mason v. Osgood, 71-212.
The clerk of the supreme court is not bound to render his services
gratuitously to a party who is allowed to appeal, under this section, in
forma pauperis. Martin v. Chasteen, 75-96; Bailey v. Brown, 105-127.
An order allowing a party to appeal in forma pauperis dispenses with
the security for costs, but does not stay proceedings upon the judgment,
appealed from. Leach v. Jones, 86-404.
A party suing in forma pauperis is not allowed to recover costs, but
where a recovery of costs is inserted in the judgment, and it is not
objected to at the time, nor called to the attention of the judge, the cor
rection will not be made in the supreme court. Hall v. Younts, 87-285.
If the transcript is not sent up in time by reason of the appellant's
failure, when notified, to pay costs of the transcript, the appellee may
may move to docket and dismiss the appeal, and this although the appeal
is in forma pauperis. Bailey v. Brown, 105-127.
If affidavit defective.-—Where the affidavit to obtain an appeal in forma
pauperis is defective, it is not a matter of discretion with the court, but
the appellee can have it dismissed as a matter of right. State v. Payne,
93-612.
Where the affidavit does not appear in the record, but the substance
thereof is set forth in the order allowing the appeal, from which it
appears that it was fatally defective, a presumption that the order was
based upon sufficient affidavit cannot arise. State v. Jones, 93-617.
If an order is made allowing a defendant to appeal as a pauper, and
the affidavit and certificate of counsel are not in the record sent to the
supreme court, it will be presumed that they were in due form; but if
they are sent up, and are not in due form, the appeal will be dismissed
on motion of the appellee. State v. Tow, 103-350.
Iji criminal actions. —An affidavit, upon which is founded an order allow
ing a convicted person to appeal, in forma pauperis, under The Code,
\ 1235, is fatally defective if it does not state that the application is in good faith. Such averment is not required in civil cases under The
Code, 11 552, 553. State v. Tow, 103-350; State v. Divine, 69-390; State
v. Morgan, 77-510; State v. Moore, 93-500; State v. Payne, 93-612; State
v. Jones, 93-617.
Sec. 554. On judgment for money, security to stay execu
tion; new undertaking, on sureties becoming insolvent;
perishable property may be sold. C. C. 1'., ss. 304, 311.
If the appeal be from a judgment directing the payment
of money, it shall not stay the execution of the judgment,
unless a written undertaking be executed on the part of
the appellant, by one or more sureties, to the effect that if
the judgment appealed from, or any part thereof, be
affirmed, or the appeal be dismissed, the appellant will pay
the amount directed to be paid by the judgment, or the
part of such amount as to which the judgment shall be
affirmed, if it be affirmed only in part, and all damages
which shall be awarded against the appellant upon the
appeal. Whenever it shall be satisfactorily made to appear
to the court that since the execution of the undertaking
the sureties have become insolvent, the court may, by rule
or order, require the appellant to execute, file and serve a
new undertaking, as above; and in case of neglect to exe
cute such undertaking within twenty days after the service
of a copy of the rule or order requiring such new under
taking, the appeal may, on motion to the court, be dis
missed with costs. Whenever it shall be necessary for a
party to any action or proceeding to give a bond or an
undertaking, with surety or sureties, he may, in lieu
thereof, deposit with the officer or in court as the case may
require, money to the amount for which such bond or
undertaking is to be given. The court in which such
action or proceeding is pending may direct what disposi
tion shall be made of such money pending the action or
proceeding. In any case where, by this section, the money
is to be deposited with an officer, a judge of the court, at
any time, upon the application of either party, may, before
such deposit is made, order it to be deposited in court
instead of with such officer; and a deposit made, pursuant
to such order, shall be of the same effect as if made with
such officer.
The perfecting of an appeal by giving the undertaking
mentioned in this section, shall stay proceedings in the
court below upon the judgment appealed- from; except
when the sale of perishable property is directed, the court
below may order the property to be sold and the proceeds
thereof to be deposited or invested, to abide the judgment
of the appellate court.
Undertaking filed, for costs only.—Where the plaintiff, in a suit for laud,
at the spring term of the superior court of a county, recovers judgment
and the defendant appeals, but gives an undertaking for the costs only,
and at the next ensuing term of the supreme court in June, the judg
ment is affirmed, and then the plaintiff takes out a writ of possession
from the superior court, which is executed, he will be entitled to the
crops growing on the ground for that year. Cox v. Hamilton, 69-30.
The appellee has the right to issue execution when an undertaking to
secure the costs of the appeal only is given, instead of the deposit of
money to bide the event of the appeal. Bledsoe v. Nixon, 69-81.
Contention whether or not the bond is for costs only. —Where there was a
contention as to whether the undertaking was intended for a bond for
costs only, or by mistake was written as a supersedeas bond, an issue as to
that was framed and sent down to be passed upon by a jury. Burnett v.
Nicholson, 86-728.
Form of supersedeas bond. —No particular form is required for an under
taking to stay execution upon appeal, and if words are inserted in such
undertaking repugnant to its intent, they will be rejected as surplusage.
Oakley v. Van Noppen, 100-287.
When two separate undertakings.— Where the undertaking on appeal for
the costs and the undertaking to stay execution are in one instrument,
the appellee, upon filing the proper proofs of the insolvency of the
surety, is entitled to have the appeal dismissed, as prescribed by this
section, but where the two undertakings are separate and distinct, the
appellant has a right to have his appeal heard, although the surety to
the undertaking to stay execution is insolvent, when the surety to the
undertaking for costs of appeal is solvent. Alderman v. Rivenbark,
96-134.
See I 559, post.
Sec. 555. 1f judgment be to deliver document, or personal
property, it must he deposited or security be given. C, C.
P., 8. 305.
If the judgment appealed from direct the assignment or
delivery of documents or personal property, the execution
of the judgment shall not be stayed by appeal, unless the
things required to be assigned or delivered be brought into
court, or placed in the custody of such officer or receiver as
the court shall appoint, or unless an undertaking be entered
into on the part of the appellant, by at least two sureties,
and in such amount as the court or a judge thereof shall
direct, to the effect that the appellant will obey the order
of the appellate court upon the appeal.
Sec. 550. If to execute conveyance, it must be executed and
deposited. C. V. P., s. 300.
If the judgment appealed from direct the execution of
a conveyance or other instrument, the execution of the
judgment shall not be stayed by the appeal until the instru
ment shall have been executed and deposited with the
clerk with whom the judgment is entered, to abide the
judgment of the appellate court.
Sec. 557. Security where judgment is to deliver real prop
erty, or for a sale of mortgaged premises. C. C. P., s. 307,
If the judgment appealed from direct the sale or delivery
of possession of real property, the execution of the same
shall not be stayed, unless a written undertaking be exe
cuted on the part of the appellant, with one or more sure
ties, to the effect that, during the possession of such prop
erty by the appellant, he will not commit, or suffer to be
committed, any waste thereon, and that if the judgment
be affirmed, he will pay the value of the use and occupa
tion of the property, from the time of the appeal until the
delivery of possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment,
not exceeding a sum to be fixed by a judge of the court
by which judgment was rendered, and which shall be
specified in the undertaking. When the judgment is for
the sale of mortgaged premises; and the payment of a
deficiency arising upon the sale, the undertaking shall also
provide for the payment of such deficiency,
Writ of restitution.—On a trial of summary ejectment before a justice,
judgment was given for the plaintiff who was put into possession, on an
appeal the superior court decided against the plaintiff and this latter
judgment was affirmed on appeal to the supreme court: Held, that the
defendant is entitled to a writ of restitution and damages for use and
occupation of premises by the plaintiff. Meroney v. Wright, 84-336.
See \ 563, post.
Sec. 558. Stay of proceeding* upon security being given.
C. C. P., 8. 308.
Whenever an appeal is perfected as provided by this
Code, it stays all further proceedings in the court below
upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter
embraced therein ; but the court below may proceed upon
any other matter included in the action and not affected
by the judgment appealed from. And the court below
may, in its discretion, dispense with or limit the security
required, when the appellant is an executor, administra
tor, trustee or other person acting in another's right; and
may also limit such security to an amount not more than
fifty thousand dollars, where it would otherwise exceed
that sum.
Effect of appeal duly perfected.—When an appeal is taken from the supe
rior to the supreme court, a proceeding to obtain a new trial, on account
of newly discovered testimony, cannot be instituted in the superior
court, but must be brought in the supreme court, and upon a proper case,
that court will remand the cause to the superior court. Bledsoe v. Nixon,
69-81.
A plaintiff whose land has been taken by the commissioners of a town,
for a public use, waives all irregularities in the proceedings condemn
ing such land, when he appeals from the assessment of damages, and such
appeal carries up no other question than the amount of the compensa
tion which the plaintiff may have been entitled to. Johnson v. Rankin,
70-550.
Though an appeal may always be taken without the consent of the
judge, it is probable that in case of an interlocutory order, it becomes a
matter of sound discretion with him whether he will proceed or not.
When such appeal is clearly one not contemplated by The Code, and
affecting no substantial right of the defendant, it is clearly his duty to
proceed. Carleton v. Byers, 71-331.
An appeal by a railroad company (the defendant), from the assessment
of damages by commissioners appointed in pursuance of its charter,
brings up the whole case into the superior court, where the parties can
have every right relating to such damages adjudged and determined.
Phifer v. Railroad, 72-433.
When an appeal from the superior court is perfected, the judge below
has no further jurisdiction of the matter. McRae v. Cotn'rs, 74-415;
Isler v. Brown, 69-125.
In attachment proceedings. —Where an appeal is taken from a refusal to
discharge an attachment, the court below cannot, pending the appeal,
allow a motion to dismiss to be entered, for the appeal takes the case
out of its jurisdiction as to all matters embraced in the judgment.
Pasour v. Lineberger, 90-159.
In attachment proceedings where an appeal is taken and the decision
may dispose of the case altogether, it is discretionary in the court below
to proceed upon matter collateral to the main purpose during the pen
dency of the appeal. Penniman v. Daniel, 91-431.
In injunction proceedings. —An order granting, refusing or dissolving an
injunction is not stayed by the appeal. Green v. Griffin, 95-50.
Order for safe custody of a fund. —An appeal arrests all proceedings on the
judgment appealed from, but does not withdraw from the court below the
authority to make orders for safe keeping of a fund pending the appeal.
Hinson v. Adrian, 91-372.
Acts of 1887, ch. 192.—The chief purpose of this statute (see \ 552, ante),
seems to be to preserve the judgment appealed from intact, and give it
force and effect as a lien upon property as if it were a docketed judg
ment pending the appeal, and to have the supreme court to exercise its
jurisdictional functions in ordinary cases simply as a court of errors.
The authority of the supreme court is not abridged in any respect or
degree, deriving its powers, as it does, from the constitution, and not
from the general assembly. Stephens v. Koonce, 106-222.
Clerk should give notice to sheriff.—After an appeal has been perfected,
it is the duty of the clerk to give notice thereof to the sheriff, and, until
the sheriff receives such notice that an execution has been superseded,
it is his duty to obey it. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
See. 559. Undertaking may be in one instrument or nev
erat. V. C. P., s. 309.
The undertakings may be in one instrument or several,
at the option of the appellant; and a copy, including the
names and residences of the sureties, must be served on
the adverse party, with the notice of appeal, unless the
required deposit is made and notice thereof given.
Secures appellee's costs only. —Undertaking on appeal is to secure the
costs of the appellee, and the surety thereto is not liable for appellant's
costs if the judgment is reversed. Each party may be required by the
clerk to pay his costs when incurred. If this is not done, the clerk must
look only to the party incurring them, except when appellee recovers
costs; then the appeal bond is liable. Morris v. Morris, 92-142; Office
v. Huffsteller, 67-449.
\ 552, ante, and cases cited.
Copy of undertaking served. —A copy of the undertakings, with names
and residences of sureties, should be served on appellee. Robeson v.
Lewis, 64-734.
Sec. 5fi0. Sureties to justify, or undertaking of no effect.
C. C. P., s. 310. 1887, c. 12 1.
An undertaking upon an appeal shall be of no effect
unless it be accompanied by the affidavit of one of the
sureties that he is worth double the amount specified
therein. The respondent may, however, except to the suf
ficiency of the sureties within ten days after the notice of
the appeal, and unless they or other sureties justify within
ten days thereafter, the appeal shall be regarded as if no
undertaking had been given. The justification shall be
upon a notice of not less than five days. Before the appel
lee shall be permitted to move to dismiss an appeal, either
for any irregularity in the undertaking on appeal, or for
failure of the sureties to justify as prescribed in this sec
tion, he shall give written notice to the appellant of such
motion to dismiss at least twenty days before the district
from which the cause is sent up is called. Said notice
shall state the grounds upon which the motion is based.
In all such cases, at least five days before the district from
which the cause is sent up is called, the appellant may file
with the clerk of the supreme court a new bond, justified
in the manner required by this section. The penalty in
the new bond shall be the same in amount as the penalty
in the original bond, or, in lieu of filing such new bond,
the appellant may deposit with the clerk of the supreme
court a sum of money equal to the penalty in the original
bond. When a new bond has been thus filed, or deposit
made, the cause shall stand as if the bond had been duly
given or deposit made in the court below.
Note. —All of this section after the word "days" in line nine was
added by acts 1887, ch. 121.
Waiver. —Where the case signed by the judge states "bond fixed at
$
and filed," the acquiescence of the appellee in its sufficiency will
be assumed and consequently a waiver of his right to object in the
supreme court. Hancock v. Bramlett, 85-393; Gruber v. Railroad, 92-1;
Moring v. Little, 95-87; Mfg. Co. v. Barrett, 94-219.
This rule only applies when the entries are made by the judge. No
such presumption arises when they are made by the clerk. Mfg. Co. v.
Barrett, 94-219.
Where the appeal bond is not justified, the objection is waived by
the appellee subsequent to the filing of the bond signing with the
appellant a "case agreed" on the appeal. Howerton v. Henderson,
86-718. Contra, McMillan v. Nye, 90-11.
The motion to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the bond is
not justified cannot be allowed, where the record shows there was a
waiver by the acceptance of the bond in court. Jones v. Potter, 89-220;
Harshaw v. McDowell, 89-181.
Where the surety to an undertaking on appeal does not justify, but it
appears that the surety was tendered and accepted, and the instrument
duly executed in open court without objection: Held, to be a waiver of
the statutory requirement. Greenlee v. McCelvey, 92-530.
An appeal will be dismissed if appeal bond is not justified unless
appellee has waived the same in writing or by entry in the record. Lytle
v. Lytle, 90-647; McCanless v. Reynolds, 91-244.
Bond not justified. —Where the appeal bond for costs is not justified by
the surety, but simply endorsed by the clerk, "the within bond is
good," it is not a compliance with this section. Bryson v. Lucas,
85-397; Chastain v. Chastain, 87-283.
Justification of sureties. —Where the appeal bond is justified by only
one surety, the appeal will be dismissed. Smith v. Reeves, 85-574.
Note. —This section now requires only one of the sureties to justify.
Appeals will be dismissed if not perfected according to law. In all
cases of appeal, except in forma pauperis, a written undertaking is
required (unless properly waived), and one of the sureties must make
affidavit that he is worth double the amount specified therein. Har
shaw v. McDowell, 89-181.
The justification of the surety to an undertaking on appeal must be
made by the surety himself. The affidavit of another as to the pecu
niary reputation of the surety will not answer the demands of the law.
Morphew v. Tatem, 89-183.
When the surety to an undertaking on appeal executed it by making
his cross-mark, and justifying before the clerk, the undertaking was
sufficient in law. State v. Byrd, 93-624.
The statute does not require that the justification of the surety on the
undertaking on appeal should state that he is worth double the amount
of the undertaking, above his liabilities and his homestead and exemp
tions allowed by law. It is sufficient, if it state that he is worth double
the amount therein specified. Witt v. Long. 93-388.
An appeal will be dismissed, when the surety on the undertaking
only justifies in the amount, and not double the amount thereof. Tur
ner v. Quinn, 92-501; Anthony v. Carter, 91-229; Lytle v. Lytle, 90-647;
State v. Roper, 94-859; State v. Wagner, 91-521; McCanless v. Reynolds,
91-244.
Where the justification to the undertaking on appeal was taken
before a person purporting to be a justice of the peace, and who signed
the jural as such, it will be presumed that the person signing the jurat
was a justice, in the absence of evidence that he was not so in fact.
Chamblee v. Baker, 95-98.
Note. —By amendment above (1887, ch. 121) notice of motion to dis
miss for irregularity in the undertaking or for failure of surety to
justify must be given.
Haste, igurrance or inadvertence. —Haste, ignorance or inadvertence is
no excuse for failure to justify undertaking. Turner v. Quinn, 92-501.
If appeal bond not dated. —Where an appeal bond has no date, it will be
presumed to have been filed on the day that it is justified. Boyden v.
Williams, 92-546.
Motion to dismiss. —Heretofore motion to dismiss appeal would be
allowed where there was no waiver of undertaking, no deposit of money,
and bond was not justified in double its amount. Bailey v. Rutjes,
91-420; State v. Wagner, 91-521.
But no appeal will now be dismissed for imperfections in appeal bond
unless twenty days' notice of motion is given. Jones v. Slaughter,
96-541When judgment entered out of term. —Where it appears in the record that
the judgment appealed from was not entered until after the expiration
of the term, and it also appears under the signature of the judge, that
the undertaking on appeal was filed, it will be presumed that the court
by consent, allowed the bond to be filed without regard to time. Mfg.
Co. v. Barrett, 94-219.
Providing appeal bond not duty of counsel.—Providing an undertaking on
appeal is not a professional duty which an attorney owes to his client,
and an assumed agency of counsel to see thst this is done, is the same
as if the agent was not a professional man, and his neglect is the neg
lect of the principal, so far as losing the right to appeal is concerned.
Churchill v. Ins. Co., 92-485; State v. Byrd, 92-7; Griffin v. Nelson,
106-235.
Strict compliance with statute required.—If appeals are not properly per
fected, the court has no authority (if so disposed) to grant relief against
such negligence. Hemphill v. Blackwelder, 90-14.
The court will require a strict compliance with the statute regulating
appeals. An affidavit that it was not the custom in the court below to
justify appeal bonds is no excuse. Smith v. Abrams, 90-21.
Indulgence not to be repeated. —Where an appeal was dismissed because
the appeal bond was not justified, the court reinstates the case because
of the statute not having heretofore been enforced, but this indulgence
will not be followed. Mauney v. Gidney, 86-717.
Summary judgment against sureties. —Prosecution bonds and undertak
ings on appeal, being sent up as a part of the record, summary judg
ment may be taken upon them, as before the adoption of C C P. . Office
v. Huffsteller, 67-449.
On a certiorari. —The bond in an application for certiorari must be jus
tified, as is required for an appeal bond, or the application will be dis
missed. Chastain v. Chastain, 87-283.
But the court can, upon proper affidavit, permit the certiorari in forma
pauperis. Brittain v. Mull, 93-490; State v. Warren, 100-489.
See \ 545, ante.
See. 561. Undertaking must be filed with clerk. C. C. P.f
8. 312.
The undertaking must be filed with the clerk with whom
the judgment or order appealed from was entered. This
chapter as to the security to be given upon appeals, and as
to the stay of proceedings, shall apply to all appeals taken
to the supreme court.
Duty of clerk and sheriff, when undertaking is filed. —The undertakings
necessary to perfect an appeal may be given within a reasonable time
after notice of the appeal has been given. And after such appeal has
been perfected, it is the duty of the clerk to give notice thereof to the
sheriff, in order that any execution which may have issued may be
superseded. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423.
Until the sheriff receives notice that the execution has been superse
ded, he is to obey it according to its tenor. On receiving such notice,
it is his duty to stop proceedings, and to return the writ, with a state
ment of his action under it, and the reason for his ceasing to act. Ibid.
Sec. 502. 1ntermediate orders affecting the judgment may
be reviewed on appeal. C. C. P., s. 313.
Upon an appeal from a judgment, the court may review
any intermediate order involving the merits and necessa
rily affecting the judgment.
Interlocutory orders. —An interlocutory order is always under the con
trol of the court during the pendency of the action. Shinu v. Smith,
79-310; Worth v. Gray, 59-4.
Appeals in equity cases. —In appeals from the former superior courts of
law, purely discretionary powers of such courts were never reviewed by
the supreme court. Otherwise, in appeals from the courts of equity, in
which every order and decree of such court, affecting the rights of par
ties, were the proper subjects of review by the supreme court. Long v.
Holt, 68-53.
Upon the hearing of an appeal from an order granting or refusing an
injunction, the supreme court will review the findings of fact of the
court below. Jones v. Boyd, 80-258.
See \\ 548, 550, and cases there cited.
Sec. 563. Judgment on appeal; restitution; undertakings
on appeals and writs of certiorari. C. C. P., s. 314. R.
C, c. 4, s. 10. 1785, c. 233, s. 2. 1810, c. 793, s. 1. 1831.
c. 40, s. 2.
Upon an appeal from a judgment or order, the appellate
court may reverse, affirm or modify the judgment or order
appealed from, in the respect mentioned in the notice of
appeal, and as to any or all the parties, and may, if neces
sary or proper, order a new trial. When the judgment is
reversed or modified, the appellate court may make complete
restitution of all property and rights lost by the erroneous
judgment.
Undertakings for the prosecution of appeals and on writs
of certiorari shall make a part of the record sent up to the
supreme court, on which judgment may be entered against
the appellant or person prosecuting the writ of certiorari
and his sureties, in all cases where judgment shall be ren
dered against the appellant or person prosecuting said writ.
Judgment affirmed. —Where there were no objections to any part of the
evidence, and no exceptions to his honor's charge, the supreme court,
on appeal, can only affirm the judgment. Barnard v. Johnston, 78-25;
Bank v Creditors, 80-9.
Where there is no statement of the facts proved on the trial, and no
error appears on the record, the judgment below will be affirmed. Paschall v. Bullock, 80-8.
Where no error appears, the judgment below will be affirmed. State
v. Rouse, 88-682.
Cause remanded, when. —Though no assignment of errors appear upon
the record, yet if it appear that other parties are necessary, the judgment
will not be affirmed, but the case remanded to make the proper parties.
Brooks v. Headen, 80-11.
The supreme court may remand a case for additional findings of fact.
Shepard v. Bland, 87-163.
Where the court below rendered judgment in favor of the defendant
non obstante veredicto, which was reversed on the appeal, a venire de novo
should not be granted, but the case should be remanded to be proceeded
with as if no erroneous ruling had been made. Scott v. Queen, 95-340.
Where the judgment was rendered in the superior court against three
defendants, only one of whom appealed, the supreme court, upon affirm
ing the judgment, will remand the case, in order that the judgment
may be enforced against all of the defendants. Baxter v. Wilson, 95-137.
Where, in the opinion of the court, additional findings are necessary
in order to do justice between the parties, the case may be sent back
for the trial of additional issues. McDouald v. Carson, 95-377.
The supreme court has the power in a proper case, to remand causes,
to the end that proper amendments may be had, or further proceedings
taken in the court below. Holley v. Holley, 96-229.
Where two defences are pleaded, and the court below gives judgment
for the defendant on one of them without trying the other, which judg
ment is reversed on appeal, the case will be remanded in order that the
other defence may be tried. Setzer v. Setzer, 97-252.
A plaintiff suing for the possession of her children by writ of habeas
corpus obtained judgment for their recovery, and the defendant appealed
under \ 1662 of The Code. After the appeal, and before the hearing in
this court, the plaintiff became insane and was committed to an asylum:
Held, the case must be remanded to the judge now riding the judicial
district in which the case was tried, to the end that he may take such
action as his jurisdiction over minor children confers. Jones v. Cotten,
108-457.
Hew trial in part ordered. —Ordinarily, for error in the charge or in the
reception or rejection of evidence, the verdict is set aside entirely, but
it may be set aside in part, and as to certain issues only, when it plainly
appears that the error could not, and did not, affect the findings on the
other issues. Burton v. Railroad, 84-192.
The appellate court may order a new trial as to some of the issues,
and affirm the judgment below as to the rest. Lindley v. Railroad,
88-547; Crawford v. Mfg. Co., 88-560; Price v. Deal, 90-290.
A new trial may be awarded on the issue as to damages, leaving the
findings upon the othet issues undisturbed. Boing v. Railroad, 91-199.
Where of several issues, severable in their relations to each other, an
error enters into one, which in no wise affects the others, a new trial
may be granted on that issue alone, or where some essential issue in
controversy, necessary to be determined before final judgment, has not
been passed upon, such issue may be eliminated and set down for trial.
Jones v. Swepson, 94-700.
When partial new trial will not be granted. —Where an action was brought
for a tract of land describing it as a whole, and incompetent evidence
was admitted which related only to a part, the judgment of the supreme
court will be for a venire de novo generally, and it will not grant a new
trial only as to that portion of the land affected by the incompetent evi
dence. Beam v Jennings, 96-82.
Judgment of restitntion, —Whenever a party is put out of possession
by process of law, and the proceedings are adjudged void, an order
for a writ of restitution is a part of the judgment. Perry v. Tupper,
70-538; Ibid, 71-385; Meroney v. White, 84-336.
When a judgment is reversed, the appellant shall be restored to all
that he has lost by the occasion of the judgment. Rollins v. Henry,
77-467; Boyett v Vaughan, 86-725; Norville v. Dew, 90-43.
After judgment for plaintiff in ejectment, and ejection of defendant,
a party alleging himself to be the landlord of the defendant cannot, on
motion, be let in and allowed a writ of restitution. His remedy is by a
new action against plaintiff. Edwards v. Phillips, 91-355.
When a party is put out of possession of land, or compelled to pay
money, under a judgment which is afterwards reversed or set aside, the
court will restore the party to the possession of the land, and give him
a remedy for the money thus paid. Lytle v. Lytle, 94-522.
The courts will promptly enforce restitution of property taken by
abuse of legal process, and will not proceed to administer the rights of
the parties until such restitution is made. Powell v. Allen, 103-46.
The writ of restitution lies to restore a party to the possession of
property of which he has been deprived by some erroneous process ;
hut it will not be employed to put one in possession where he has not
been ousted by the court, nor to take possession from one who has
acquired it pending litigation, and not by virtue of any order, judgment
or process therein. Railroad v. Railroad, 108-304.
Appeal dismissed. —When it appears that the subject-matter of the action
has been disposed of, and the only matter involved is a question as to
costs, the appeal will be dismissed. State v. Railroad, 74-2S7; Hasty v.
Funderburk, 89-93; Pritchard v. Baxter, 108-129.
An exception, however, is made to the rule in the last case where the
appellant is a fiduciary. May v. Darden, 83-237.
When a certiorari, returned to the supreme court, is imperfect, show
ing no statement of case on appeal, a new certiorari will not l>e granted,
but the appeal dismissed. Skinner v. Badham, 80-14.
Sustaining demurrer. —Ordinarily, where a demurrer that the answer is
insufficient to defeat a recovery is sustained by the supreme court, it is
a finality, but not where there is a material omission in the complaint.
Foy v. Haughton, 83-467.
Powers of lower court after judgment on appeal. —The superior court has
no power to modify or change a judgment or decree of the supreme
court. Murrill v. Murrill, 90-120; Dobson v. Simonton, 100-56.
When a new trial is granted by the supreme court, the case is to be
tried upon the whole merits, as if there had been no former trial (unless
it is a new trial restricted to certain of the issues). McMillan v. Baker,
92-110.
A new trial awarded by the supreme court, re-opens the controversy
for the admission of any evidence that is itself competent, and which,
if offered at the first trial, should have been received, and this equally
applies to cases when the facts are to be passed on by the judge instead
of a jury. Jones v. Swepson, 94-700; Ashby v. Page, 108-6.
In an action against the defendant for failing to account for notes put
into his hands for collection, the referee ruled that the action could not
be maintained for want of a demand, which ruling was sustained by the
superior court, but sufficient facts were found by the referee to warrant
a judgment, the question of demand being removed: // was held, that
upon reversing the judgment in the supreme court, the defendant was
not entitled to have the case retried, on the issue as to whether he had
ever received the claims or not. Wiley v. Logan, 96-510.
When a question has been decided on a former appeal to the supreme
court in the same action, the matter is res judicata, and not open for
reconsideration by the court below. Gordon v. Collett, 107-362.
Cannot reform verdict. —Where there is a verdict in favor of the appel
lee, the supreme court can only award a new trial for error committed on
the trial before the jury, and cannot reform the verdict or give final
judgment for the appellant. McMillan v. Baker, 97-197.
Can correct judgment rendered below. —Where interest has been errone
ously computed in a judgment, and it can be separated from the prin
cipal, the supreme court will not direct a new trial, but that the proper
correction shall be made. Porter v. Grimsley, 98-550.
Judgment on appeal. —Upon appeals, the supreme court will enter such
judgment or decree as, upon inspection of the whole record, it shall
appear ought to be rendered. Bush v. Hall, 95-82.
The supreme court will not direct a final judgment until all the mate
rial issues of fact are settled, either by verdict or admissions of record.
Gatling v. Boone, 98-573.
Judgment entered by inadvertence corrected. —Where, by inadvertence, a
judgment is entered in the supreme court for a new trial, when it should
have been one remanding the case, it will be corrected, on motion. Scott
v. Queen, 95-340: Cook v. Moore, 100-294; Summerlin v. Cowles, 107-459;
Scroggs v. Stevenson, 108-260.
Newly discovered evidence. —The supreme court will grant a new trial
for newly discovered evidence, where it is clear that substantial injustice
has been done on the trial below by the unavoidable failure to produce
the evidence there, and another trial will probably change the result,
but not when the newly discovered evidence is merely cumulative or
corroborative of that offered on the former trial. Simmons v. Mann,
92-12; Sikes v. Parker, 95-232.
A new trial for newly discovered evidence will be granted only, when
(1) the newly discovered witness will probably testify as alleged; (2)
when such evidence is material; (3) when it is probably true; (4) when
the party has used due diligence in discovering it, and (5) when it is
not merely cumulative. Dupree v. Ins. Co., 93-237.
The supreme court has no jurisdiction to grant new trials in criminal
cases for newly discovered evidence. State v. Starnes, 94-973; State v.
Gooch, 94-987; State v. Starnes, 97-423; State v. Rowe, 98^629.
It is not sufficient in an application for a new trial for newly discovered
evidence, for applicant to state generally that he exercised diligence in
his attempts to secure the evidence; he must set out the particulars of
his efforts, so that the court may see and judge of his diligence. Sikes
v. Parker, 95-232.
While the supreme court may grant a new trial for newly discovered
evidence, and will grant a re-hearing because of error in law committed
by it, or when it is made to appear that it has overlooked or misappre
hended some material fact apparent in the record, it will not do so for
any error or mistake of fact, nor error of law not assigned in the case
on appeal. Weathersbee v. Farrar, 98-255.
The jurisdiction of the supreme court to grant new trials is confined
to those cases where the motion is based upon the discovery of new and
material evidence, and does not extend to those cases where irregulari
ties or misconduct of the parties or jurors is charged. Davenport v.
McKee, 98-500.
Granting a new trial for newly discovered evidence is purely discre
tionary, whether made in the lower court or in the supreme court. In
the future such motions will be disposed of without discussing the facts.
Brown v. Mitchell, 102-347.
Judgment on prosecution and appeal bonds.—Prosecution bonds, and under
takings on appeal, being sent up as a part of the record, summary judg
ment may be taken upon them, as before the adoption of The Code.
Office v. Huffsteller, 67-449.
An appeal bond is part of the record, and its execution cannot be
denied by plea and proof in the appellate court. The remedy is by an
application in the court below to correct the record and to have a tran
script of the amended record sent up. Whitehead v. Smith, 53-351.
Where there is a contention as to whether an appeal bond is a super
sedeas bond, or was intended to cover costs only, an issue will be framed
and sent down to be passed upon by a jury. Burnett v. Nicholson,
86-728.
Upon affirmance by the supreme court of a judgment in favor of the
plaintiff, he is entitled, on motion, to judgment against the sureties upon
an undertaking to stay execution pending appeal, and such affirmance is
conclusive of the liability of the sureties. Oakley v. Van Noppen, 100-287.
On appeal from assessment of damages for right-of-way. —Where the apprais
ers appointed to assess the damages reported the amount thereof at three
hundred dollars, to which the owner of the property did not except, but
the railroad company did, upon the ground that such assessment was
excessive, and appealed to the superior court, where the jury returned
a verdict for a greater sum: Held, that judgment could not be properlyrendered for a greater amount than the original assessment, as the only
issue on the appeal was, whether such assessment was excessive. Rail
road v. Church, 104-525.
Procedendo. —Where an appeal as to laying out a cart-way is taken to
the superior court, and the jury find the issue in favor of the petitioner,
instead of issuing a procedendo to the lower court, the better practice is
that a writ issue from the superior court, where the appeal was tried, to
the sheriff to summon a jury to lay off the cart-way and assess damages.
Warlick v. Lowman, 104-403.
Sec. 5(H. On appeal, or recordari , of defendant from jus
tice'sjudgment, court mau compel plaintiff to secure costs.
R. C„ c. :tl, s. 104. 18.il, c. 2!), s. 1.
When any defendant shall appeal from the judgment of a
justice of the peace to the superior court, or when the judg
ment of such justice shall be removed by the defendant,
by recordari or otherwise, to a superior court, the court
having cognizance of such appeal or recordari may, upon
sufficient cause shown by affidavit, compel the plaintiff to
give an undertaking, with sufficient surety, for payment of
the costs of the suit, in the event of his failing to prosecute
the same with effect.
Notice of appeal from a justice.— On an appeal from a justice of the peace,
notice must be given the appellee. Green v. Hobgood, 74-234; Sparrow
v. Davidson, 77-35; Spaugh v. Boner, 85-208; State v. Johnson, 109—.
But the court, in its discretion, may allow notice to be given after the
appeal is docketed in the superior court. Marsh v. Cohen, 68-283; Rail
road v. Richardson, 82-343; West v. Reynolds, 94-333.
Notice need not be served when the adverse party is present in court
when appeal taken. Richardson v. Debnam, 75-390; State v. Crouse,
86-617. Otherwise, notice in ten days. Finlayson v. Am. Acc. Co., 109—.
See \ 549, ante, and cases cited; also, The Code, gg 876, 877.
Recordari. —Before an application for a recordari can be entertained,
petitioner must aver that he has paid, or offered to pay, the justice's
fees. An order for a recordari should be accompanied with an order for
a supersedeas and suspension of execution. Steadman v. Jones, 65-388.
Objection to the docketing of a return to a writ of recordari that the
justice's fees have not been paid, can only be taken by the justice. Carmer v. Evers, 80-55.
After return made by the justice w ho tried the cause, to a writ of record
ari, objection cannot be made that it was not addressed to him. Ibid.
Void judgment examined into by recordari. McKee v. Angel, 90-60.
Allowing an amendment to a petition for a recordari is matter of discre
tion, and cannot be reviewed on appeal. Pritchard v. Sanderson, 92-41.
Where a defendant relied on the assurance of a justice of the peace
that his cause would not be tried, after which the justice rendered a
judgment against him in his absence, the remedy is by an appeal, or a
recordari as a substitute therefor, and not by a motion to set aside the
judgment. Navassa Guano Co. v. Bridgers, 93-439.
See the numerous decisions as to recordari cited under j> 545, ante, and
Rule 14 of the Superior Court, post.
Undertaking on appeal. —The Code of Civil Procedure requires no surety
on an appeal from a justice's judgment, unless a stay of execution is
asked for. Steadman v. Jones, 65-388.
The Code, g 1 17-120, has no application in courts of justices of the
peace. There is no statutory provision that allows a mortgage of real or
personal property to be given in lieu of the undertaking on appeal from a
justice's judgment, required by The Code, \ 883, 884. Comron v. Standland, 103-207.
Although neither the justice nor the plaintiff is required to accept a
mortgage from the defendant in lieu of an undertaking on appeal, yet,
if the defendant give and the plaintiff accept such mortgage, it is valid,
and can be enforced. The stay of the execution is a valuable and suf
ficient consideration to support the mortgage. Ibid.
See The Code, gg 875, 882, 883 and 884.
Security for costs required of plaintiff, when.—In an appeal by a defendant
to the superior court from a judgment of a justice of the peace, it lies
within the discretion of the presiding judge to require the plaintiff to
give security for the further prosecution of the suit, or not. Smith v.
Railroad, 72-62; Lea v. Brooks, 49-423.
Sec. Sfi5. Appeals from a Justice to be tried at first term of
court ; judgment against party cast and his sureties; how
to have amount ofjudgment ascertained in case of default.
R.C.,c.31,s.l05. 1777, c 115, 8.63. 1794, c. 414, s. 1.
1887, c. 443.
When an appeal shall be taken from the judgment of a
justice of the peace to a superior court, the same shall be
reheard by the court; whereupon, an issue shall be made
up and tried by a jury at the first term to which it is
returned, unless continued, and judgment shall be given
therein against the party cast and his sureties. And when
the defendant shall make default, the plaintiff in actions
instituted on a single bond, a covenant for the payment of
money, bill of exchange, promissory note, or a signed
account, shall have judgment, and in other cases may have
his inquiry of damages executed forthwith by a jury: Pro
vided, that if the appellant shall fail to have his appeal
docketed as required by law, the appellee may, at the term
succeeding the term to which the appeal is taken, have the
case placed on the docket, and, upon motion, the judgment
of the justice shall be affirmed and judgment rendered
against the appellant accordingly, and for the costs of
appeal, and against his sureties upon the undertaking, if
there be any, according to the conditions thereof: Provided
further, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent
granting the writ of rccordari in cases now allowed by law.
NOTE. —The two ''provisos" were added to this section by ch. 443,
acts 1887. It would seem that the effect is to give the appellee an addi
tional remedy— not to deprive him of the right to move to dismiss with
out complying with the proviso. See decisions upon a similar rule in
the supreme court (Rule 17, post).
Appeal must be to the next term. —An appeal must be taken to the next
term of the appellate court. Hahn v. Latham, 87-172; Ballard v. Gav,
No appeal, when. —Where both parties are present at the trial before the
justice, the case tried, and no appeal taken, the judgment is final and
conclusive, and the matter cannot be opened by an action to rehear and
an appeal from a judgment therein. Gambill v. Gambill, 89-201.
No appeal lies from a confession of judgment. Rush v. Steamboat
Co., 67-47.
.
No appeal lies from an interlocutory judgment of a justice (here an
order dismissing a warrant of attachment) to the superior court, and the
latter court should make no order, except dismissing the appeal. Phelps
v. Worthington, 92-270.
Refusal to dismiss appeal from justice. —An appeal will not lie from a
refusal to dismiss an appeal from a justice's judgment. Chester v. Rich
ardson, 82-343; State v. Johnson, 109—.
Note.—It is well settled now that no appeal lies from a refusal to dis
miss any proceeding. The party should have his exception noted and
proceed to trial. See cases cited under jl 548, ante, sub-head "Refusal to
Dismiss," and Lambe v. Love and Guilford v. Georgia, both in 109 N. C
Trial de novo. —Upon an appeal to the superior court by a plaintiff, in
an action commenced before a justice of the peace, for the recovery of
560, due by former judgment, the plaintiff is entitled to have the case
heard de novo, and for that purpose it should be entered on the civil
issue docket. Wells v. Sluder, 68-156.
An appeal by a plaintiff, from a judgment rendered against him in a
justice's court, for I6.30, costs in a suit against the defendant on an
account for over $20, should be entered by the clerk on the trial or civil
issue docket of the superior court, to be tried de novo. Such appeal can
not be heard by the judge at chambers. Com'rs v. Addington, 68-254.
The provision requiring appeals from judgments for twenty-five dol
lars or less, to be tried solely on matters of law appearing on the papers,
applies only to cases where the amount demanded is not more than
twenty-five dollars, and not to cases where the judgment is given only
for that amount. Hintou v. Deans, 75-18.
Note. —By the amendment to the constitution, all appeals from a jus
tice are to be heard de novo, irrespective of.the amount involved.
Effect of appeal in arrest and bail. —An appeal from the judgment of a
justice of the peace discharging one who has been arrested in a civil
action, vacates the judgment and the order of arrest continues in force
pending the appeal. Patton v. Gash, 99-280.
Estoppel. —Under the present practice a memorandum, "general
issue," entered on a justice's docket, as embracing defendant's defence,
will be construed to mean nothing more than a general denial of the
plaintiff's cause or causes of action; hence, evidence of au estoppel by
judgment or of another action pending, is not admissible in support of
such a defence. Blackwell v. Dibbrell, 103-270.
Where, in an action before a justice, defendant pleaded that title to
land was in controversy, which was disallowed, but the justice's ruling was
reversed on appeal and action dismissed: Held, in a new action brought
for same cause of action in the superior court, the defendant is estopped
to plead that such court has not jurisdiction. The Code, §838; Peck
v. Culberson, 104-425.
Amendment in the superior court. —In an appeal from a justice's judg
ment, it is in the discretion of the presiding judge to allow or refuse
amendments of any pleas before the justice upon such terms as may
seem to him just; and he may, in his discretion, allow a new plea to be entered, upon payment of all costs up to that time. Hinton v. Deans,
75-18On an appeal from a justice's judgment, the judge below had the power
to allow a plea to be filed, which the defendant had been refused per
mission to file before the justice of the peace. Lane v. Morton, 78-7; or
to amend his answer to make it what he intended it to be before the
justice of the peace. Heyer v. Beatty, 76-28.
The acceptance or rejection of an answer, after appeal from a justice's
judgment, is a matter of discretion for the judge. Johnson v. Rowland,
80-1; Thomas v. Simpson, 80-4.
The jurisdiction of the superior court in appeals from a justice of the
peace is entirely derivative, and if the justice had no jurisdiction in the
action as it was before him, the superior court can derive none by amend
ment. Ijames v. McClamroch, 92-362; Allen v. Jackson, 86-321 ; Boyett
v. Vaughan, 85-363; Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
If written answer filed before justice is lost, the judge may allow
another to be filed, liaison v. Johuson, 78-78.
See \\ 273, 54S, 549 and 550, ante, and cases cited.
Note.—See, also, The Code, J 908, which is as follows: " No process or
other proceeding begun before a justice of the peace, whether in a civil
or a criminal action, shall be quashed or set aside for the want of form,
if the essential matters are set forth therein; and the court in which any
such action is pending, shall have power to amend any warrant, process,
pleading or proceeding in such action, either in form or substance, for
the furtherance of justice, on such terms as shall be deemed just, at any
time either before or after judgment."
The court can allow either a warrant or an affidavit to be amended.
State v. Sykes, 104-694.
The exercise of the power conferred by this section (908) is discretion
ary, if the nature of the action is not changed. State v. Vaughan, 91532; State v. Crook, 91-536.
The superior court can amend, on appeal from the justice, a process
or pleading to make the jurisdiction appear properly (here supplying an
omission of averment of value of property in the summons in an action
not on contract), when, in fact, it did exist, but did not appear on the
face of the papers. Mfg. Co. v. Barrett, 95-36.
II seems, that where a plaintiff, in an action for a tort before a justice,
only demands damages to the amount of fifty dollars, and on the trial
it is ascertained that his damages amount to more than that sum, he
may remit the excess, and thus give jurisdiction to the justice. Noville
v. Dew, 94-43.
The objection, that a cause of action is not such as can be "split up,"
so as to bring it within the jurisdiction of a justice, must be made before
the justice; otherwise, it cannot be made in the superior conrt on appeal,
unless the defendant is permitted to amend. Blackwell v. Dibbrell,
103-270.
The court can amend the warrant after verdict in the trial of the
appeal. State v. Smith, 103-410.
Where an amendment to a warrant was allowed after verdict, wherein
facts were alleged not in the original, and the record did not show there
had been any evidence introduced to support them, there was error,
and a new trial ordered. State v. Baker, 106-758.
Where it appears from the allegations in the affidavit and warrant,
and upon the proofs, that the mayor or justice of the peace really had
jurisdiction, an averment which takes the case out of such jurisdiction
may be cured by amendment or treated as surplusage.
Judgment by default. —On afi appeal from the justice's court, if the
defendant does not plead, so that an issue may be made up, the court
may render judgment either with or without jury. Ramsour v. Harshaw, 30-480.
There cannot, properly, be a final judgment by default, upon an appeal
from a justice of the peace; but the matter must be determined upon
proofs, either by the court or by the jury. Williams v. Beasley, 35-112.
Where, in an action of assumpsit upon an unliquidated account, judg
ment was taken before a magistrate, on an appeal, it is error to take a
judgment final, upon a default, in the upper court, without an inquiry of
damages. Hartsfield v. Jones, 49-309.
See U 385 and 386, ante.
Ruling of justice reversed. —Where a justice of the peace refuses, on
application, to set aside a judgment rendered without service of sum
mons, the proper course on appeal is to reverse his ruling, and not to
direct him to do so. Erroneous, irregular and void judgments defined,
McKee v. O'Neal, 90-60.
Rehearing. —Justices of the peace have power to rehear cases decided by
them only when one of the parties is absent at the trial, and such
absence is caused by sickness or excusable mistake or neglect, and the
application to rehear is filed within ten days. The Code, ' /. 845. After
the lapse of that time a rehearing cannot be granted. Navassa Guano
Co. v. Bridgers, 93-439New trial. — A justice cannot grant a new trial. The remedy is by
appeal. Navassa Guano Co. v. Bridgers, 93-439; Froneberger v. Lee,
66-333.
Sureties to the appeal bond,—Under the act of 1879, ch. 68, a summary
judgment may be given against sureties to the appeal bond in appeals
from justices' judgment. Prior to that act, the remedy was by civil
action. Brown v. Brittain, 84-552; McMinn v. Patton, 92-371.
The sureties to the appeal bond are bound for the amount of the
judgment rendered in the superior court. Their liability is not restricted
to the amount of the judgment appealed from. Walker v. Williams,
88-7.
Sec. BO0. 1f plaintiff appeal and do not recover a greater
stun, he shall not recover costs, Out be liable to pay. 1t. C,
c. 31, s. 100. 1794, c. 414, s. 17.
If judgment be entered for the plaintiff, and he shall not
recover on his appeal a greater sum than was recovered
before the justice, besides interest accrued since the rendi
tion of the judgment, he shall not recover the costs of the
appeal, but shall be liable at the discretion of the court to
pay the same.
See \\ 542 and 543, ante and rules io, 14 and 24 of the superior court,
post.
Sec. 507. Controversy, how submitted without action. C. C.
P., s. 315.
Parties to a question in difference, which might be the
subject of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon
a case containing the facts upon which the controversy
depends, and present a submission of the same to any court
which would have jurisdiction if an action had been
brought. But it must appear by affidavit that the contro
versy is real, and the proceedings in good faith to deter
mine the rights of the parties. The judge shall thereupon
hear and determine the case, and render judgment thereon
as if an action were pending.
Affidavit indispensable prerequisite. —The court will not hear a cause,
under this section, in the absence of the affidavit required by it. Heryey v. Edmunds, 68-243; Grant v. Newsom, 81-36; Wilmington v. Atkin
son, 88-54; Jones v. Commissioners, 88-56.
Submission must be to a court having jurisdiction. —The submission must
be to a court which would have jurisdiction if the action had been com
menced by summons. Jones v. Commissioners, 88-56.
Purpose of this section. —This section does not confer on parties who
differ as to their rights authority to propound to the court, on a case
agreed, interrogatories in respect thereto. The purpose of the section
is simply to dispense with the formalities of a summous, complaint and
answer, and, upon an agreed state of facts, to submit the case to the
court for decision. McKethan v. Ray, 71-165; Little v. Thorne, 93-69.
Statement of facts. —In the submission of a controversy without action,
the statement of facts upon which the judgment of the court is asked
should not be a mere narration of the facts out of which the controversy
arises, but should contain a statement of the subject-matter and nature
of the controversy, and of the conflicting claims of litigants. Overman
v. Sims, 96-451.
The summary method provided by The Code for the submission of an
action upon a case agreed contemplates that all the facts necessary to a
determination of the questions submitted shall be fully stated in the case
agreed; and where it appeared that some of the facts were recited in
exhibits which were not attached, and that leave was given the parties
to add other matters, the cause was remanded to be perfected. Railroad
v. Reidsville, 101-404.
Trial by jury does not obtain. —The statute allowing controversies, with
out action, to be submitted upon a "case agreed," does not contemplate
a trial by jury. Moore v. Hinnant, 90-163.
Judgment in vacation. —Judgment can be rendered by consent in vaca
tion upon verdict given in term. Harrell v. Peebles, 79-26.
But not without consent of parties. Hardin v. Ray, 89-364.
Judgment can be entered by consent of parties in vacation. Hervey
v. Edmunds, 68-243.
Appeal from opinion without judgment rendered.—Where, in a case under
this section, an appeal is taken upon the judge's filing an opinion, but
without rendering judgment, the case will be remanded at the appel
lant's costs. Moore v. Hinnant, 87 505.
Cases to which this section does not apply.—Where a sheriff has money in
his hands raised under executions in favor of different creditors against
the same defendant, and the creditors set up conflicting claims to the
money, it is not such a case as may be submitted to a judge, without
action under this section by the adverse claimants. Bates v. Li1ley,
65-232.
Title to a public office cannot be passed upon by this mode of pro
ceeding. Davis v. Moss, 81-303.
This section does not apply to criminal causes. State v. Alphin, 81-566.
Nor to the case of a sheriff asking instructions for the application of
moneys. Milliken v. Fox, 84-107.
This section has no application to proceedings before a justice of the
peace. Wilmington v. Atkinson, 88-34.
Sec. 5O8. Judgment roll. C. C. P., s. 3 10.
Judgment shall be entered in the judgment docket, as in
other cases, but without costs for any proceeding prior tq
trial
The case, the submission, and a copy of the judg
ment, shall constitute the judgment-roll.
Sec. 509. Judgment, how enforced and appealed from. C.
C. P., s. 317.
The judgment may be enforced in the same manner as
if it had been rendered in an action, and shall be subject
to appeal in like manner. .
Sec. 570. Judgment may be confessed for debt due on con
tingent liability. C. C. P., s. 325.
A judgment by confession may be entered without action,
either in or out of term, either for money due or to become
due, or to secure any person against contingent liability on
behalf of the defendant, or both, in the manner prescribed
by this chapter.
Judgments confessed. —The guardian of a lunatic may confess judgment
for his ward. McAden v. Hooker, 74-24.
Where a judgment is confessed by one person against himself and
entered of record, parol evidence is not admissible to show that it was
intended to have been entered against another. Davidson v. Alexan
der, 84-621.
Corporation. —A corporation, nothing to the contrary appearing, may,
by the action of its proper officers, confess judgments as a natural per
son, if the essential requirements of the statute are complied with.
Sharp v. Railroad, 106-308.
Section not suspended. —This provision is not repealed or modified by the
"act suspending The Code," 1868-'9, ch. 76. Hervev v. Edmunds,
68-243..
Sec. S7 1. Statement in writing, anil form thereof. C. C. 1'.,
». 320.
A statement in writing must be made, signed by the
defendant and verified by his oath, to the following effect:
(1) It must state the amount for which judgment may be
entered, and authorize the entry of judgment therefor;
(2) If it be for money due, or to become due, it must
state concisely the facts out of which it arose, and must
show that the sum confessed therefor is justly due, or to
become due;
(3) If it be for the purpose of securing the plaintiff
against a contingent liability, it must state concisely the
facts constituting the liability, and must show that the
sum confessed therefor does not exceed the same.
Requisites. —A judgment confessed by the guardian of one who is non
compos mentis, if the statement required by this section is verified by the
guardian, in the absence of fraud, is not irregular. McAden v. Hooker,
74-24.
A judgment confessed under this section must contain a concise, veri
fied statement of the facts and transactions out of which the indebted
ness arose. A mere statement that the defendant is indebted to the
plaintiff in a certain sum "arising from the acceptance of a draft,"
setting out a copy thereof, is not sufficient. Davidson v. Alexander,
84-621.
Where the affidavit of the debtor set out that he was justly indebted
to the judgment creditor in a certain amount, but did not embrace the
account which was filed, this was not a compliance with the statute, and
the judgment was void. Davenport v. Leary, 95-203.
The requirements of this section must be strictly observed. 
Sec. 572. Judgment ami execution. C. C. P., *. 327.
The statement may be filed with the clerk of the superior
court of the county in which the defendant resides, or, if
he does not reside in the state, of some county in which he
has property. The clerk shall indorse upon it and enter
on his judgment docket a judgment of the court for the
"amount confessed, with three dollars costs, together with
disbursements. The statement and affidavit, with the judg
ment indorsed, shall thenceforth become the judgment-roll.
Executions may be issued and enforced thereon in the same
manner as upon judgments in other cases in such courts.
When the debt for which the judgment is recovered is not
all due, or is payable in installments, and the installments
are not all due, the execution may issue upon such judg
ment for the collection of such installments as have become
due, and shall be in the usual form, but shall have indorsed
thereon by the attorney or person issuing the same a direc
tion to the sheriff to collect the amount due on such judg
ment, with interest and costs, which amount.shall be stated,
with interest thereon, and the costs of said judgment.
Notwithstanding the issue and collection of such execution,
the judgment shall remain as security for the installments
thereafter to become due, and whenever any further install
ment becomes due, execution may in like manner be issued
for the collection and enforcement of the same.
Sec. 573. Offer of compromise. C. C. P., a. 328.
The defendant at any time before the trial or verdict,
may serve upon the plaintiff an offer in writing to allow
judgment to be taken against him for the sum or property,
or to the effect therein specified with costs. If the plaintiff
accept the offer, and give notice thereof in writing within
ten days, he may file the summons, complaint, and offer,
with an affidavit of notice of acceptance, and the clerk
must thereupon enter judgment accordingly. If the notice
of acceptance be not given, the offer is to be deemed with
drawn, and cannot be given in evidence; and if the plain
tiff fail to obtain a more favorable judgment he cannot
recover costs, but must pay the defendant's costs from the
time of the offer; and in case the defendant shall set up a
counterclaim in his answer to an amount greater than the
plaintiff's claim, or sufficient to reduce the plaintiff's
recovery below fifty dollars, then the plaintiff may serve
upon the defendant an offer in writing, to allow judgment
to be taken against him for the amount specified or to
allow said counterclaim to the amount specified, with costs.
If the defendant accept the offer, and give notice thereof in
writing within ten days, he may enter judgment as above
for the amount specified, if the offer entitle him to judg
ment, or if the amount specified in said offer shall be
allowed him in the trial of the action. If the notice of
acceptance be not given, the offer is to be deemed with
drawn, and cannot be given in evidence; and if the defend
ant fail to recover a more favorable judgment, or to estab
lish his counterclaim for a greater amount than is specified
in said offer, he cannot recover costs, but must pay the
plaintiff's costs from the time of the offer.
Offer must be made by all the defendants. —An offer to compromise a suit
under this section must be made by all the defendants, or by their com
mon attorney. Williamson v. Canal Company, 84-629.
In action for damages for conversion. — In an action to recover damages for
the conversion of personal property, the defendant has no right to force
the plaintiff to accept the property, for the conversion of which he is
sued, or pay costs; nor would defendant have such right in an action of
claim and delivery, unless the tender of the property is accompanied by
a proposal to pay an amount as damages not less than that ultimately
assessed by the jury. Stephens v. Koonce, 103-266.
Sec. 574. Effect of compromises in general. JS74-'ii, c.
17S, x. 1.
In all claims, or money demands, of whatever kind, and
howsoever due, where an agreement shall have been or shall
be made and accepted for a less amount than that demanded
or claimed to be due, in satisfaction thereof, the payment of
such less amount according to any such agreement in com
promise of the whole, shall be a full and complete discharge
of the same.
Effect of compromise. —An agreement to take part of a debt in payment
of the whole was nudum pactum before the adoption of this section
(i874-'5, ch. 178). Fickey v. Merrimon, 79-585; Coppersmith v. Wil
son, 104-28.
The acceptance by a judgment creditor of a promissory note upon a
third person in satisfaction of the judgment, is a discharge of thejudgment, although the note is for a less amount than the judgment. Currie
v. Kennedy, 78-91.
The payment and acceptance of a less sum than is actually due, in
compromise of the whole debt, is a complete and valid discharge, under
this section. And this is so, although the debt compromised was one
contracted and reduced to judgment before this section became the law,
if the compromise was made after it was enacted. Jones v. Mizell, 104-9;
Koonce v. Russell, 103-179; Tiddy v. Harris, 101-589.
Act constitutional.— As, under this section, the payment of a less sum,
where a greater is due, is not a discharge, unless voluntarily accepted
as a compromise by the creditor, the section is not in conflict with art,
1, I 10, constitution United States, in its application to pre-existing con
tracts. Koonce v. Russell, 103-179.
Conditional compromise. —Where one pays a certain sum upon a con
tested debt in compromise thereof, in case it shall afterwards be estab
lished, a finding of the jury that it never existed, will entitle the payer
to a judgment of restitution of the sum paid. Fickey v. Merrimon,
79-535Sec.H7i>. Defendant may offer to liquidate damages con
ditionally. V. C. P., 8. 32V.
In an action arising on contract, the defendant may, with
his answer, serve upon the plaintiff an offer in writing,
that if he fails in his defence, the damages be assessed at a
specified sum ; and if the plaintiff signify his acceptance
thereof in writing, ten days before the trial, and on the
trial have a verdict, the damages shall be assessed accord
ingly.

, Either party may exhibit to the other, or to his attorney, .
at any time before the trial, any paper material to the action,
and request an admission in writtng of its genuineness. If
the adverse party, or his attorney, fail to give the admission
within four days after the request, and if the party exhib
iting the paper be afterwards put to expense in order to
prove its genuineness, and the same be finally proved or
admitted on the trial, such expense to be ascertained at the
trial, shall be paid by the party refusing the admission,
unless it appear to the satisfaction of the court that there
were good reasons for the refusal. The court before which
an action is pending, or a judge thereof, may, in their dis
cretion, and upon due notice, order either party to give to
the other, within a specified time, an inspection and copy,
or permission to take a copy, of any books, papers, and
documents in his possession or under his control, contain
ing evidence relating to the merits of the action or the
defence therein. If compliance with the order be refused,

given in evidence, or punish the party refusing, or both.
Motion to nonsuit plaintiff for failure to produce books and papers. —A motion
to nonsuit a plaintiff for not producing books or papers, according to
the provisions of this section, cannot be made, unless a previous order
of the court bas been obtained for the production of such books or
papers. Graham v. Hamilton, 25-381.
Affidavit not necessary.—Under the present statute (The Code, \\ 578 and
1373), no affidavit is necessary in order to get an order for the produc
tion of papers in the possession of the adverse party, but the court now
has power, on motion and due notice, to require the production of papers
or books which contain evidence pertinent to the issue. McDonald v.
Carson, 95-377.
Due notice. —Due notice, under this section, is notice sufficient to enable
the party to have the document present when called for. McDonald v.
Carson, 95-377Admission in writing of genuineness of paper. —An admission in writing,
under this section, that a letter is genuine, does not preclude comments
by counsel as to the truth of its contents. Knight v. Houghtalling, 85-17.
Powers of the court. —Where, in an action of ejectment, the plaintiff's
lessor claims title under a deed which is in the possession of the defend
ant, who claims a right to it by virtue of an endorsement upon it, the
court can order the production of the deed for inspection, but cannot
order its registration before
equitable right to it by virtue of the endorsement has been tried and
decided against him. Linker v. Benson, 67-150.
The courts have power to require the production of documents and
private writings containing evidence pertinent to the issue. McLeod v.
Bullard, 84-515.
The court has the power, by virtue of 2? 578 and 1373 of The Code, to
order the production of proper papers, pertinent to an issue to be tried
and ir. the possession of the opposite party. McDonald v. Carson, 94-497.
An order to produce papers will be granted, when. —In an action upon a
bond, the court, on affidavit that the bond is believed to be a forgery,
may, at the appearance term, order the plaintiff to file the instrument
for such time as the court may think proper in the clerk's office for the
inspection of the defendant. McGibbony v. Mills, 35-163.
A petition or motion supported by affidavit will be sustained for an

tion sought otherwise than by such inspection. Justice v. Bank, 83-8.
Where an administrator, as bank cashier, kept his intestate's accounts,
an order to produce the books of the bank is proper. Commissioners v.
Lemly, 85-341.
The production of papers containing evidence relating to the merits
of an action will be ordered \w the court, and, when produced, they are
competent evidence for all legitimate purposes. Austin v. Secrest, 91-214.
Where the examination of the debtor shows that his books of account
contain evidence material to the investigation he should be required to
produce them. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
Order granted before complaint filed.—A court cannot order the produc
tion of papers by the defendant on the application of the plaintiff,
where no declaration has been filed. Branson v. Fentress, 35-165.
The order will be granted before the complaint has been filed, when
it is averred by the applicant, and not demed by the opposing party,
that such discovery is necessary to enable the plaintiff to state with
accuracy the facts upon which his case is founded. Justice v. Bank, 83-8.
Answer to rule to produce papers. —Where a rule has been served on a
party to produce a certain letter, an affidavit of the party that he had
not seen the letter since he sent it—that he had not knowingly destroyed
it—and had made diligent search and could not find it—is a sufficient
answer to warrant a discharge of the rule. Fuller v. McMillan,
Paper must be produced, or absence accounted for. —A negotiable instru
ment, the execution of which is admitted in the answer, must be pro
duced on the trial or accounted for. Morrow v. Allman, 65-508.
Contents of paper proved by parol, when.—The contents of a paper-writing
cannot be proved by parol, unless notice has been given to the adverse
party, who has it in possession, to produce it on the trial. And this is
so, notwithstanding such paper-writing is a will proven and recorded
according to law, but the record of which has been destroyed by the
burning of the court-house where it was deposited. Murchison v.
McLeod, 47-239.
Appeal from order discharging rule to produce papers.—The supreme court
will not pass upon the propriety of an order discharging a rule for the
production of papers, unless the facts are stated, by the court below,
upon which the application is based. An affidavit filed in the court
below is not such statement, but is only evidence offered to enable that
court to find the facts. Maxwell v. McDowell, 50-391.
Where party fails to avail himself of this section.—When the court found
as a fact that the defendant executor for eleven years resisted payment
of the debts sued on, because he doubted the genuineness of the
acknowledgment or new promise, set up by the plaintiff in reply to
defendant's plea of statute of limitations, as the defendant might have
had an inspection of the paper containing such alleged promise, there
was an unreasonable delay of payment, and the defendant was liable
for costs. Long v. Oxford, 104-408.
See, also, The Code, ? 1373.
Sec. 570. Action for <Uscorer yZ«bolishe<l. C. C. r„ ft. .332.

section authorizes only the examination of parties to the action, or of
those interested in it. Strudwick v. Brodnax, 83-401.

covery under oath, and substitutes for it a remedy in harmony with The
Code system by allowing a party, in support of the allegations of his
complaint, or of a cross-action set up in a counterclaim, after eliciting
admissions from his adversary by verifying his pleadings, to examine
such adversary party, as to facts within his peculiar knowledge, both
before and at the trial of the action. Helms v. Green, 105-251.

certain cases. C. C. P.. s. 333. 1870, c. 183. 1883, c.
3 10, 8*. 1, 2. 188',, c. 301, ss. 1, 2.
A party to an action may be examined as a witness at
the instance of the adverse party, or of any one of several
adverse parties, and for that purpose may be compelled, in
the same manner and subject to the same rules of exami
nation as any other witness, to testify, either at the trial or
conditionally or upon commission: Provided, no person
who is or shall be a party to an action founded on a judg
ment rendered before the first day of August, one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-eight, or on any bond executed
prior to said date, or the assignor, endorser or any person
who has at the time of the trial, or ever has had, any inter
est in such judgment or bond, shall be a competent witness
on the trial of such action, but this proviso shall not apply
to the trial of any action commenced before the first day of
August, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, nor
to the trial of any action in which the defendant therein
relies upon the plea of payment in fact, or pleads a counter
claim and also introduces himself as a witness to establish
the truth of such plea, but in all such cases the rules of
evidence as contained in this Code shall prevail. In all
actions now pending or which may be hereafter instituted
upon judgments rendered before the first day of August,
one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, or upon any
bond or promissory note under seal executed prior to said
date, wherein a reference has been or may be ordered by
the court to ascertain the condition or state of the assets
belonging to the estate of any deceased debtor in the hands
of his administrator or executor, who is or may be defend
ant in such actions, it shall be competent for the defendant
administrator or executor of such deceased debtor to tes
tify and be examined as a witness in his own behalf con
cerning his administration upon the estate of his intestate
or decedent. When in such cases the defendant admin
istrator or executor shall have testified or been examined
as a witness in his own behalf, it shall also be competent
for the plaintiff to testify and be examined in the same in
regard to such administration.
Note.—All that part of this section after the word "prevail" in line
twenty was added by ch. 361, acts 1885.
Adverse party may be cross-examined. —Where the judgment debtor is
examined, the creditor does not make him his witness, but may crossexamine and contradict him. The provision in The Code, allowing the
examination of parties to actions, takes the place of the bill for dis
covery in the former system of procedure. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376.
This section applies where both parties are living. —This section applies to
cases where both parties are living, and does not interfere with the ope
rations of l 590. Waddell v. Swaun, 91-105.

See \\ 588 and 1 35 1.
Attorney. —The compensation to which an attorney will be entitled for
his services as counsel in collecting a note executed before 1868, does
not give him such an interest in the note as to render him an incompe
tent witness under this section. Grant v. Hughes, 96-177.
The "proviso " (act of 1879, c. 183) construed.— Under the act of 1879,'ch.
183, it is not admissible for the plaintiff to prove by his own oath, or to
examine the defendant to prove the non-payment of a bond in suit exe
cuted prior to August 1, 1868. Caunon v. Morris, 81-139.
The act of 1879, ch. 183, forbids only the introduction of thetestimonv
of parties in interest to rebut the presumption of payment raised by
time, and does not apply where a surety is seeking to recover out of his
principal money paid by him since 1868 on a note executed before that
date. Smith v. Haynes, 82-448.
Under chapter 183, acts 1879, a party to a note under seal executed
before August 1, 1868, is incompetent to prove payment thereof. Blue v.
Gilchrist, 84-239.
Under act 1879, ch. 183, a party to an action on a bond executed prior "
to August 1, 1868, is an incompetent witness to maintain or defend the
suit. Jones v. Henry, 84-320; Tabor v. Ward, 83-291; Wilkerson v.
Buchanan, 83-296; Macy, ex parte, 83-63; Cannon v. Morris, 81-139.
The effect of this act is to restore all the common law rules of evidence,
applicable in a suit on a bond executed prior to August 1, 1868. Pugh
v. Grant, 86-39.
This applies only to actions upon bonds for the payment of money,
and does not apply to suits upon official bonds. Morgan v. Bunting,
86-66.
Semble, that under this act the plaintiff, in a judgment obtained before
August 1, 1868, is not competent to prove its non-payment in a motion
for leave to issue execution. Johnston v. Jones, 87-393.
NoTe. —This " proviso " was amended by acts 1883, ch. 310 (supra), by
permitting the defendant to prove payment in fact or a counterclaim.
Amendment of 1883, ch. 310, construed. —The plaintiff is not a competent
witness in an action upon a bond executed prior to August, 1868, except
where the defendant relies upon the plea of payment in fact or upon a
counterclaim, and introduces himself as a witness to establish the truth
of such plea. Acts of 1883, ch. 310, construed by Ashe, J. This con
struction embraces a counterclaim, which is in the nature of a crossaction, where the plaintiff relies upon payment in fact. Brown v. Cooper,
89-237; Simpson v. Simpson, 107-552.
In an action to rescind a contract for fraud in falsely representing a
bond executed prior to August 1, 1868, to be unpaid, the obligor is a
competent witness to prove that it has been paid. The proviso in this
section only applies to actions founded 0n the bond. Borden v. Gulley,
92-127.
An administrator of a deceased debtor who is a defendant, is incom
petent to testify to any admissions which he may have heard his intes
tate make in regard to the non-payment of a bond executed prior to
August 1, 1868. Smith v. Smith, 97-27, Compare Haliburton v. Car
son, 100-99.
If actual payment is relied upon, the prohibition of the competency
of parties in interest as witnesses does not apply; a/iler, where the stat
ute ofpresumption of payment is invoked. Alston v. Hawkins, 105-3.
See \\ 588, 589 and 590, post, and The Code, \ 1351.
Note. —This section originally contained only the first six lines, and
merely made a party to an action compellable to testify at the instance
of the adverse party. The "proviso" (acts 1879, ch. 183) modified this
by rendering incompetent, as a witness, any party to an action on a
judgment rendered prior to 1st August, 1868, or on a bond executed
before that date. Acts 1883, ch. 310, modified the proviso to render
incompetent all who have at the trial, or ever have had, any interest in
such judgment or bond, but exempting from the proviso all actions
begun before August 1, 1868, and all actions in which the defendant
relies on the plea of payment in fact, or pleads a counterclaim, and per
mitting such defendant to be introduced to establish such plea. Acts
1885, ch. 361, further renders competent the personal representative,
when sued on a judgment rendered or bond executed prior to August 1,
1868, and a reference is ordered to state an account of the estate in his
hands, to testify concerning his administration of the estate.

C. P., s. 334.
The examination, instead of being had at the trial, as
provided in the preceding section, may be had at any time
"before the trial, at the option of the party claiming it,
before a judge or clerk of the court, on a previous notice to
the party to be examined, and any other adverse party, of
at least five days, unless for good cause shown the judge
shall order otherwise. But the party to be examined shall
not be compelled to attend in any county other than that
of his residence, or where he may be served with a sum
mons for his attendance.
Sec. J>82. Party, how compelled to attend. C. C. P., s. 335.
The party to be examined, as in the preceding section
provided, may be compelled to attend in the same manner
as a witness who is to be examined conditionally ; and the
examination shall be taken and filed by the judge or clerk
in like manner, and may be read by either party on the
trial.
Sec. iJ83. Testimony of party may be rebutted. C. C. P., s.
330.
The examination of the party thus taken may be rebutted
by adverse testimony.
May be rebutted. —Sucli deposition may be rebutted, on the trial, by
adverse testimony. Hudson v. Jordan, 108-10.
A party may lead, contradict or discredit the adverse party when sum
moned as his witness. Coates v. Wilkes, 92-376, overruling Strudwick
v. Brodnax, 83-401.
Sec. 584. Effect of refusal to testify. C. C. P., s. 337.
If a party refuses to attend and testify, as in the four
preceding sections provided, he may be punished* as for a
contempt, and his complaint, answer or reply may be
stricken out.
Sec. S8S. Testimony of a party not responsive to the inqui
ries may be rebutted by the oath of the party calling him.
C. C. P.,s.338.

provided, may be examined on his own behalf, subject to
the same rules of examination as other witnesses; but if he
testify to any new matter, not responsive to the inquiries
put to him hy the adverse party, or necessary to explain or
qualify his answers thereto, or discharge when his answers
would charge himself, such adverse party may offer himself
as a witness on his own behalf in respect to such new mat
ter, subject to the same rules of examination as other witr
nesses, and shall be so received.
Sec. 586. Persons for whom action i» brought or defended
may be examined. C. C. -P., s. 339.
A person for whose immediate benefit the action is prose
cuted or defended, though not a party to the action, may
be examined as a witness in the same manner and subject
to the same rules of examination as if he were named as a
party.
Who may be examined. —This only authorizes the examination of parties
(in interest or) to the action. Strudwick v. Brodnax, 83-401.
Sec. 587- Examination of co-plaintiff or co-defendant.
C. V. P.,s. 340.
A party may be examined on behalf of his co-plaintiff or
of a co-defenda1»t as to any matter in which he is not jointly
interested or liable with such co-plaintiff or co-defendant,
and as to which a separate and not joint verdict or judg
ment can be rendered; and he may be compelled to attend
in the same manner as at the instance of an adverse party,
but the examination thus taken shall not be used in behalf
of the party examined.
And whenever one of several
plaintiffs or defendants, who are. joint contractors or are
united in interest, is examined by the adverse party, the
other of such plaintiffs or defendants may offer himself as
a witness to the same cause of action or defence, and shall
be so received.
As to what matters. — A party may 1ie compelled to attend court and be
examined in behalf of a co-plaintiff or a co-defendant "as to any mat
ter in which he is not jointly interested or liable," etc., and in such case

sent of parties, authority to examine witnesses or hear evi
dence, the husband and wife of any party thereto, or of any
person in whose behalf any such suit, action or proceeding
is brought, prosecuted, opposed or defended, shall, except
as hereinafter stated, be competent and compellable to give

bigamy), or in any action or proceeding in consequence of
adultery, or any action or proceeding for divorce on account
of adultery (except to prove the fact of marriage), or in
any action or proceeding for or on account of criminal con
versation. No husband or wife shall be compellable to
disclose" any confidential communication made one to the
other during their marriage.
Husband and wife competent witnesses, when.—Under the act of 1866, ch.
43, a wife was not a competent witness for her husband; but it is other
wise under this section of The Code. Rice v. Keith, 63-319.
In a suit for divorce a vinculo malrivionii, the plaintiff (the husband)
is a competent witness to prove the impotence of his wife. Prior to the

76-433In an indictment against the wife for fornication and adultery with
another, the husband is competent to prove her marriage to him. State
v. McDuffie, 107-885.
Husband and wife not competent witnesses, when. —At common law, neither
the husband nor wife is allowed to prove the fact of access or non-access;
and as such rule is founded " upon decency, morality and public policy,"
it is not changed by this section, allowing parties to testify in their own
behalf. Boykin v. Boykin, 70-262.
In an action for divorce for alleged adultery, neither the husband nor
wife is a competent witness, nor shall the admissions of either be received

Motion for a new trial in divorce. —The allowance of a motion to vacate
a judgment and grant a new trial, for newly discovered evidence, and
for matters occurring since the trial and final judgment, under the super
visory power and equitable jurisdiction of the supreme court, is a mat
ter of sound discretion, in the exercise of which the court will be gov
erned by the peculiar circumstances of each case. Therefore, when in
a petition for divorce, the following issue, to-wit, "Did the plaintiff
commit adultery ? " etc., was submitted to and found by the jury against
the plaintiff, and final judgment was rendered against him in such peti
tion: Held, that the court would not set aside the judgment and grant
a new trial, upon the ground that the principal witness who testified as
to the adultery of the plaintiff, had subsequently been convicted of per
jury, for swearing falsely upon the trial of said issue, when it appeared
that the principal witness for the prosecution, upon the trial of the
indictment for perjury, was the plaintiff and petitioner, who made the
motion to vacate. Home v. Home, 75-101.

One who is a party to a suit, though in his corporate capacity, is not
competent to testify as to a transaction with a person deceased. Com'rs
v. Lash, 89-159
A witness who is a devisee under a script executed in January, is not
competent upon trial of an issue devisavit vel non, to speak of conver
sations with the testator tending tq impeach a script executed in May
thereafter. As the last may be found to be a revocation of the will pre
viously made, such witness is directly interested in the result of the
issue, as to which of the two is the will of the testator. Hathaway v.
Hathaway, 91-139.
The act of attesting the execution of a will is not such a "personal
transaction" with the deceased as is contemplated in the prohibition
contained in this section. Such witnesses are the witnesses of the law,
not of the parties. The Code, \ 2147. Vester v. Collins, 101-114.
An executor or administrator cum testamento anne.ro, who is also a
subscribing witness to a will, is competent to testify to the execution
thereof ; and the same rule applies to one who was competent at the
time of the making of the will, but subsequently acquired an interest
therein. Ibid.
The nature of the disqualifying interest. —The incompetency of a witness
under this section arises where he has an interest in the event of the
suit, or may avail himself of the benefit of a verdict in support of his
claim in a future action. Williams v. Johnston, 82-288.
An interest in the thing in controversy does not disable a witness
from testifying as to a communication with one deceased. The disquali
fying interest is one in the event of the action. Mull v. Martin, 85-406;
Bunn v. Todd, 107-266.
Assignors or parties having had an interest, which has ceased. —Where a
deed of trust was attacked for fraud, and the trustor was offered as a
witness to prove that there was an agreement between him and the
trustee that the latter should hold the property conveyed until the
trustor should be able to pay the debts secured from other sources:
Held, that the evidence should be permitted to go to the jury for what
it was worth. In such case, the trustee having died, and the property
having been conveyed by a substituted trustee to the defendant, the
trustor is not excluded hy this section from being a witness for the
plaintiff, who also claimed title through him. Isler v. Dewey, 67-93.
The fact that a witness was at one time the agent for a party deceased
does not render his evidence incompetent, after the agency has ceased
to exist. Murphy v. Ray, 73-588.
Under this section an obligee of a bond is not a competent witness to
prove any transaction between himself and the obligor, when such
obligor is dead at the time of the trial, although he may have previously
assigned the bond. Woodhouse v. Simmons, 73-30.
In au action against an administrator, the testimony of a witness is
not admissable to prove a transaction between the witness and the
defendant's intestate, whereby certain bonds, the subject of this actiou,
were assigned to the witness who assigned them to the plaintiff, although
upon the cross-examination a question, explanatory of a statement
made in his examination in chief, relative to such transaction, had been
asked the witness, and he had answered it. Jackson v. Evans, 73-128.
A executed a bond to B, who assigned it to C by making his mark; C
endorsed the bond to I); the assignment by B was attested by E; upon
the death of B, E was appointed his administrator. In an action brought
against E to recover on said bond: Held, that E was not a competent
witness to prove the assignment by B to C, and that C was not a compe
tent witness to prove that E did sign his name as attesting witness to
the assignment. Ballard v. Ballard, 75-190.
Concerning this section a general rule may be stated, viz.: In all cases,
except where the proposed evidence is as to a transaction, etc., with a per
son deceased, etc., the common law disqualifications of being a party
and of interest in the event of the action are removed; but as to such
transactions, etc., the disqualifications are preserved, with the added
one, not known to the common law, that if the witness ever had an
interest, upon the question of competency, it is to be considered as exist
ing at the trial. Peebles v. Stanley, 77-243.
A witness is disqualified under this section, by having had an interest
in the event of the action, and his competency is not at all affected by
the removal of that iuterest. Mason v. McCormick, 80-244; Hampton
v. Hardin, 88-592.
That an attorney has had a tax fee depending upon the result of the
suit, does not disqualify him from testifying as to a transaction or com
munication since the law permitting tax fees has been repealed. Syme
v. Broughton, 85-367.
The assignor (vendor) of a contract to convey land is not a compe
tent witness for the assignee, upon an issue between the latter and those
claiming under the deceased vendee in respect of payments made to him
by such vendee. Shields v. Smith, 104-57.
Note. —The section as now amended removes the incompetency here
tofore caused by the witness having had an interest which has since
ceased, except where the party offering him claims his interest or title
by assignment or otherwise through or under such witness.
Assignees. — Any one who has acquired the rights of a deceased per
son, whether by his deed or the deed of the sheriff, who is authorized
to make a deed for him, is an assignee within the meaning of this sec
tion of The Code, and 110 distinction is made between a voluntary and
an involuntary assignee. McCanless v. Reynolds, 74-301.
Neither of the parties (plaintiff or defendant), whether claiming as
original parties or as assignees, either by deed of the party or deed of
the sheriff, is a competent witness in regard to conversations and trans
actions between the party who offers himself as a witness, and the
assignees of the dead man. Ibid,
Attorney. —Where a note was given to an attorney for collection, who
agreed to receive one-half of the amount collected for his services, but
he returned the note to the executor of his client without collecting
anything, the attorney had never had any interest or property in the
note, and was a competent witness. White v. Beaman, 96-122.
An attorney who has no interest in the result of the action, is competent
to prove a transaction between the plaintiff and a party since insane.

a party to the action, is competent to prove a declaration made by the

affecting his estate, except as to transactions and communications
between herself and him, though she be interested in the result of the
suit. Norris v. Stewart, 105-455; Carey v. Carey, 104-171.
Mortgagee. —A mortgagee is a competent witness to the fact of the pay
ment of a debt and the cancellation of a mortgage to secure it as against
a deceased mortgagor, if it appears the witness has no interest in the
controversy, since the mortgagor does not claim through the mortgagee.
Overruling on this point, same case (104-175), Carey v. Carey, 108-267.
Witness not interested. —The fact of payment to a deceased person for
land purchased of him can be proved when neither the witness nor the
estate of the deceased vendor are interested in the result of the action.
Cade v. Davis, 96-139.

intestate are incompetent to testify in regard thereto in an action brought
by the administrator, those not interested can testify as to transactions
with or by the deceased. Watts v. Warren, 108-514.
Transactions. —The plaintiff in a suit is incompetent to prove that the
intestate of the defendant actually signed a particular paper, although
he is competent to prove his handwriting. Peoples v. Maxwell, 64-313;
Rush v. Steed, 91-226.
The exceptions to the rule allowing parties to testify, i, e., as to trans
actions between such party and a person deceased, do not extend to
cases where a defendant is offered as a witness to testify that a bond,
which was given to a person deceased and which is the subject-matter
of the suit, was in blank as to the amount payable, when executed by
him, having been filled up afterwards, in his absence and without due
authority. Isenhour v. Isenhour, 64-640.
Evidence by a party that when a bond was executed and placed in the
hands of an agent for negotiation it was in blank as to the name of the
obligee, and that the agent had no proper authority for filling such

terms of this section excluding evidence by parties in regard to such
transactions. Brower v. Hughes, 64-642.

v. Cooper, 65-183; Murray v. Blackledge, 71-492.
In a suit for the recovery of a negotiable note not endorsed, the evi
dence of an administrator (the plaintiff) is admissible to prove that his
intestate bought the note and gave therefor full value. Andrews v.
McDaniel, 68-385.
A plaintiff is a competent witness to prove the value of an article sold
to the defendant's intestate; it is not a communication or transaction
with the deceased. March v. Verble, 79-19. Or to prove any act of
the deceased not had with himself. State v. Osborne, 67-259.
A party to a suit, and the others specified in this section, are not dis

Upon the- trial of an issue as to the existence of a partnership between
the plaintiff and the intestate of defendant the former is not competent

sion of intestate as a portion of the partnership stock, unless it affirma
tively appear that knowledge of such facts were not derived from trans
actions and communications with the deceased. Sikes v. Parker, 95-232.
To exclude the testimony of a party to an action upon the ground
that it related to a transaction between the witness and a deceased per
son, it must appear that the knowledge of the witness was derived from
a personal transaction with the deceased person. Thompson v. Onley,
96-9-.

declaration, made to others, in regard to the same transaction, is inad
missible. Perry v. Jackson, 84-230.
A party to the action, is not prohibited from testifying as to commu
nications made to other witnesses. Here it does not appear that the
declarations of the witness were made in the life-time of the deceased,

sense transactions or communications with the person deceased. Waddell v. Swann, 91-105.

of this section of The Code, the defendant could not testify to the con
versation between the testator and such third person. Haliburton v.
Dobson, 65-88.

107-546.
No presumption of transaction being with deceased. —The mere entry of a
credit on a bond due an intestate is not sufficient to raise a presumption
that the intestate was present, when his business was conducted by an
agent. The opposite party is competent to testify whether such trans
action was between him and deceased or not, and, if not, he is a com
petent witness. Lockhart v. Bell, 90-499.

lish the truth of such plea. Brown v. Cooper, 89-237.
See \ 580, ante.
When testimony of deceased is given in evidence. —Upon the trial of an
action involving the bona fides of a deed conveying land, it was in evi
dence that both parties claimed under one C —the plaintiff through exe

his deposition, taken on behalf of the defendant, was, without objection
of the plaintiff, admitted, in which he testified in relation to the cir
cumstances of the alleged fraudulent sale and conveyance of defendant:
Held, that under the last clause of this section the defendant became a
competent witness in his own behalf, in respect to the same transaction.
Nixon v. McKinney, 105-23; Sumner v. Candler, 92-634.
See \\ 580, 588 and 589, ante, and cases cited.
This section analyzed. — Section 589 sweeps away the common law
incompetency of witnesses on account of interest. This section (590)
contains the only restrictions in civil actions (except in special cases
provided for by gji 580 and 589). and may be summed up as applying to—
Whom—(1) Parties to the action; (2) persons interested in the event
of the' action; (3) persons through or under whom the persons in the
first two classes derive their title or interest.
Such witness is only incompetent —
When—{\) To testify in behalf of himself or the person succeeding to
his title or interest; and (2) against the representative of a deceased per
son, or committee of a lunatic, or anyone deriving his title or interest
through them.
Such witnesses, and in such cases, are only made incompetent as to—
Subject-matter—A personal transaction or communication between
such witness and the person since deceased or lunatic. And even then
there are the following—
Exceptions—When the representative of, or person claiming through
or under the deceased person or lunatic is examined in his own behalf,
or the testimony of the deceased person or lunatic is given in evidence,
then the opposite party is a competent witness as to the same transaction.
The further incompetency originally existing as to persons who have had
an interest which has since ceased has been repealed except when such
are persons through or under whom parties and persons interested in the
event of the action claim. Bunn v. Todd, 107-266.
Sec. !>!H. In what actions, for what sums, and within what
time book accounts man be proved by a party. It. C, c. 15,
s. 1. 1730, c. 57, ss. 2, ii, 7. C. C. P., s. 343 (a).
When any person shall bring an action upon a contract,
or shall plead, or give notice, of a set-off or counterclaim
for goods, wares and merchandise by him sold and delivered,
or for work done and performed, he shall file his account
with his complaint, or with his plea or notice of set-off or
counterclaim, and if upon the trial of the issue, or execu
ting a writ of inquiry of damages in such action, he shall
declare upon his oath that the matter in dispute is a book
account, and that he hath no means to prove the delivery
of any of the articles which he then shall propose to prove
by himself, but by this book ; in that case such book may
be given in evidence, if he shall make out by his own oath
that it doth contain a true account of all the dealings, or
the last settlement of accounts between himself and the
opposing party, and that all the articles therein contained,
and by him so proved, were bona fide delivered, and that he
hath given the opposing party all just credits ; and such
book and oath shall be received as evidence for the several
articles so proved to be delivered within two years next
before the commencement of the action, but not for any
article of a longer standing, nor for any greater amount than
sixty dollars.
What m»y be proven. —Plaintiff may, under the book-debt law, prove
work and labor done by his slaves, and also goods sold and delivered
for use of the defendant by sundry persons and paid for by plaintiff.
Mitchell v. Clarke, 1-25.
Under the book-debt law, in order to entitle the party to recover, he
must swear, not only that he "sold," but also that he actually "deliverd" the articles for the price of which suit is brought. Adkinson v.
Simmons, 33-416. See, also, Boggan v. Home, 97-268.
Under the book-debt law, the book and oath are only evidence of small
articles which have been delivered in two years; but they are not evi
dence that the book contains all the credits and a full and true account
of all the dealings between the parties. Alexander v. Smoot, 35-461.
Under the book-debt law, a plaintiff may prove by his own oath a bal
ance due to him of sixty dollars or under, although his account pro
duced appears to have been originally for more than sixty dollars, but
is reduced by credits below that amount. McVVilliams v. Cosby, 26-110.
Where there are divers dealings included in an account, if the plaintiff
omit some of the items so as to bring the amount under sixty dollars,
he still cannot prove the account, under the book-debt law; for under that
he has to swear that the account sued 0n contains a full statement of all
dealings. Waldo v. Jolly, 49-173.
Under the book-debt law, it is admissible to the amount of sixty dol
lars, to offer the book accounts of a decedent, containing charges against
third person and made by him. Bland v. Warren, 65-372.
Defendant can prove set-off. —Under the book-debt law, a defendant can
prove his set-off by his oath, though the adverse party has died. Web
ber v. Webber, 79-572; Thomegenx v. Bell, 1-44.
Party becomes an ordinary witness. —This act merely removes the incom
petency of the party who is examined as a witness to prove his account,
and leaves his credibility open to be inquired by a jury. Kitchen v.
Tyson, 7-314.
It is competent for a party, under the book-debt law, to swear to the
price as well as to the delivery of the articles stated in his account, and
the opposite party has the right to cross-examine him like any other
witness. Colbert v. Peercy, 25-77.
Notwithstanding the restrictions in \ 590, ante, in relation to a person's
testifying to any matter between himself and a deceased person, when
his executor or administrator is a party, he may, as heretofore, be per
mitted to testify under the book-debt law. Leggett v. Glover, 71-21 1.
Sec. 592. Book accounts, how proved by executors and
administrators. K. C, c. 15, s. 2. 1756, c. 57, s. 2. 1790,
c. 465. C. C. P., s. 343 ((>).
In actions where executors and administrators are parties,
such book account for all articles delivered within two
years previous to the death of the deceased may be proved
under the like circumstances, rules and conditions ; and in
such case, the executor or administrator may prove by him
self that he found the account so stated on the books of the
deceased; that there are no witnesses, to his knowledge
capable of proving the delivery of the articles which he
shall propose to prove by said book, and that he believes
the same to be just, and doth not know of any other or
further credit to be given than what is therein mentioned:
Provided, that if two years shall not have elapsed previous
to the death of the deceased, the executor or administrator
may prove the said book account, if the suit shall be com
menced within three years from the delivery of the articles:
Providedfurther, that whenever by the aforesaid proviso
the time of proving a book account in manner aforesaid is
enlarged as to the one party, to the same extent shall be
enlarged the time as to the other party.
Proof by execntors and administrators. —In assumpsit for fees due a
deceased attorney at law, plaintiff can prove the account under the
book-debt law by the testator's books. Charlton v. Lowry, 1-25.
When an administrator takes the book-debt oath, and swears that the
original entry is in the handwriting of a person who has not, after dili
gent inquiry, been heard of for seven years, and that he knows of no
one who can prove his handwriting, the account is sufficiently proven.
Stevelie v. Greenlee, 12-317.
Sec. 593. Copies of account are evidence unless notice given
to produce original. K. C, c. li>, 8.3.. 175G, c. 57, s. ii.
C. C. r.,s. 343(c).
A copy from the book of accounts proved in manner
above directed may be given in evidence in any such
action or set-off as aforesaid, and shall be as available as
if such book had been produced, unless the party opposing
such proof shall give notice to the adverse party or his
attorney, at the joining of the issue, or ten days before
the trial, that he will require the book to be produced at
the trial; and in that case no such copy shall be admitted
as evidence.
Original acconnt must be produced, when. —In all cases under the bookdebt law, it is the duty of the party, who wishes to prove his debt by
his own oath, to produce the original account, when notice to that effect
has been given by the other party. A voluntary destruction of the
original will not authorize the introduction of a copy. Coxe v. Skeen,
25-443-
Sec. S94. Definition of an order ; motions, how and where
made; compelling parties to festifu ; decision on motion.
C. C. P., ss. 344, :}4,;.
Even- direction of a court or judge, made or entered in
writing and not included in a judgment, is denominated
an order.
(1) An application for an order is a motion;
When a motion in the cause is the proper proceeding. —A party cannot
resort to a new and independent action when relief can be had by a pro
ceeding in the original cause. Reid v. Pass, 33-589; Singletary v. Whitaker, 62-77; Rogers v. Holt, 62-108; Mason v. Miles, 63-564; Jarman v.
Saunders, 64-367; Council v. Rivers, 65-54; Mauney v. Petnberton, 75-219;
Chambers v. Penland, 78-53; Lord v. Beard, 79-5; Lord v. Meroney,
79-14; Askew v. Capehart, 79-17; Murrill v. Murrill, 84-182.
A separate action cannot be brought by the judgment debtor to restrain
an execution 011 account of irregularity in the judgment or the execu
tion. The proper remedy is a motion in the cause. Foard v. Alexander,
64-69; Burke v. Stokely, 65-569; Faison v. Mcllwaine, 72-312; Chambers
v. Penland, 78-53; Neville v. Pope, 95-346.
A judgment by default final upon a note payable in Confederate cur
rency is irregular, and the proper remedy of the defendant is a motion
in the cause. Williams v. Rockwell, 64-325.
A motion, and not a demurrer, is the proper method of taking advan
tage of a discontinuance. Church v. Furniss, 64-659.
A proceeding by a motion, supported by affidavits, after notice to the
opposite party, to have satisfaction of a judgment entered of record,
upon the ground that it has been paid since its rendition, is the appro
priate remedy in such a case, but is neither a special proceeding nor a
civil action. It is only a motion in a cause still pending. Foreman v.
Bibb, 65-128.
After a judgment fixing an executor with assets, and a return of an
execution issued thereon nulla bona, the proper mode to subject such
executor personally is by motion founded on notice, and not by civil
action. McDowell v. Asbury, 66-444.
Where a plaintiff brought an action to review and correct a decree
heretofore made in an old suit in equity and not yet performed: Held,
upon demurrer, that the proper remedy for the plaintiff was a motion
in the original suit still pending, and not by an independent action in
the nature of a bill of review. Long v. Cole, 72-20.
A summons issued within ten days of the term of the court to which
it is returnable should be dismissed on motion. Folk v. Howard, 72-527.
Otherwise now by \ 201, ante.
A party to an action seeking relief against a judgment rendered
therein must do so by motion in the original cause, and not by an inde
pendent action. Askew v. Capehart, 79-17.
An application for alimony pendente lite can be made by a motion in
the cause. Reeves v. Reeves, 82-348.
An injunction will not lie against execution 011 a judgment which
might have been set aside by motion in due time under \ 274. Walker
v. Gurley, 83-429.
An injunction to restrain a plaintiff from executing his judgment
against the defendant will not be granted. If there is error in the judg
ment, the remedy is by a motion to modify the judgment and an order
suspending proceedings. Parker v. Bledsoe, 87-221; Coward v. Chastain, 99-443A motion in the cause is the proper remedy to impeach a summary
judgment rendered upon the bond of a delinquent sheriff. Worth v.
Cox, 89-44.
Where the action is still pending, any relief against a judgment or
decree rendered therein must be by a motion in the cause, and not by a
new action. Where parties are required by a decree to execute a con
veyance for certain land upon their coming of age, the action is pend
ing until the conveyance is executed. Morris v. White, 96-91.
When a proceeding is allowed to drop from the docket without a final
judgment being rendered, it may be brought forward, on motion, to the
end that unpaid creditors may assert their rights and the proceedings be
determined according to law. When such motion is made, it should
strictly be disposed of before contested debts are put in issue; but when
no objection is made, both questions may be disposed of at the same
time. Warden v. McKinnon, 94-378.
A judgment cannot be collaterally attacked for irregularity except for
such as render it absolutely void. The proper remedy to correct an
irregularity, wheu it does not render the judgment void, is by a motion
iji the cause. Hurgess v. Ktrby, 94-575.
Where the subject-matter of an action has been once determined by
the court, a new action will not be entertained in regard to it. If for
any reason the former judgment ought to be set aside, it can only be
done by a motion in the cause for that purpose, if the action is still
pending; and if it has been determined and come to an end, then by a
new action to directly attack it for fraud charged. Albertson v. Wil
liams, 97-264; Jones v: Coffey, 97-347.
A mortgage given under \ i2oof The Code, in lieu of the bond required
by $ 237, may be foreclosed by motion, upon notice, in the original
action. Ryan v. Martin, 103-282.
A motion in the cause for execution is the proper proceeding to sub
ject land charged with owelty of partition to the payment thereof. Her
man v. Watts, 107-646; Meyers v. Rice, 107-24.
NoTE. —The rule deducible from the authorities is thus summed up:
The judgment and proceedings may be set aside on application of a party
within a reasonable time, for any material irregularity therein, whether
the proceeding has been terminated by final judgment or not. For fraud
any order or judgment can be set aside, on motion in the cause, before
filial judgment, but after final judgment the impeachment must be by
independent action. McLaurin v. McLaurin, 106-331, citing, as authori
ties. Peterson v. Vann, 83-118; England v. Garner, 84-212; Thompson
v. Shamwell, 89-283; Williamson v. Hartman, 92-236; Fowler v. Poor,
93-466; Burgess v. Kirby, 94-575; Synie v. Trice, 96-243; Mock v. Coggin, 101-366, followed by Carter v. Rountree, 109—.
See, also, \ 274, and cases cited under sub-head "Irregular Judgments. "
Motion to set aside must be in reasonable time. —A motion in the cause to
set aside a judgment for irregularity will be entertained if made in a
reasonable time, but it is only when the irregularity is so serious in its
nature as to destroy the efficacy of the action and render the judgment
void, or when it may seriously injure and prejudice the moving party,
that there is sufficient ground to disturb the judgment. What is reason
able time depends upon circumstances. When long time has elapsed,
and the rights of third parties have grown up, the courts will be slow to
affect them. Such motions can be granted after the determination of
an action. Williamson v. Hartman, 92-236.
The motion to set aside a judgment should be made within a reason
able time, and the irregularity to warrant the setting it aside should be
in respect to some matter of substance prejudicing the party. Peoples v,
Norwood, 94-167.
What is a reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances
of each case, but the more promptly the motion is made the more
inclined the court will be to grant it. Williamson v. Hartman, 92-236.
Court may act ex mero motu. —Where relief may be had in a pending
action, it must be sought by a motion in that cause, and if anew action
is brought it will be dismissed by the court ex mero motu, if the objec
tion is not taken by the defendant. Hudson v. Coble, 97-260; Wilson v.
Chichester, 107-386; Council v. Rivers, 65-54.
Where the court has gotten jurisdiction over the parties and subject
matter of an action, it will not permit a new and independent action to
be brought to settle the same rights. The parties cannot by consent
give the court jurisdiction of such new action, and when the facts
appear, the court should ex mero motu dismiss it. Long v. Jarratt,
94-444.
Action may be treated as amotion. —When the proper remedy is by motion
in the cause, and a party by mistake of his right begins a new action,
the court may, in its discretion, treat the summons and complaint as a
motion. Jarman v. Saunders, 64-367.
An action not treated as a motion in the cause. —An action is inadmissible
as a mode of obtaining relief against an execution for irregularity; the
proper relief is, as formerly, bv motion to set it aside; notice of the
order nisi made therennder, operating in the meantime as an injunction
againt the process, but where an action had been resorted to: Held,
that it could not be treated as a motion in the original cause, (1) because
not so entitled; (2) because the only relief prayed for therein, was a per
petual injunction. Foard v. Alexander, 64-69.
Where a purchaser at a sale to make land assets, assigned his bid,
and his assignee paid the purchase-money, but did not get a deed, and
after his death his administrator and heirs at law brought suit againt the
administrator who sold the land, and the heirs at law of the intestate
whose land was sold, to have a deed executed:
was held, that the
relief must be obtained by a motion in the original cause in which the
land was sold, and the action should be dismissed, and this was so,
although the objection was not taken in the court below. In such case,
the new action will not be treated as a motion in the original cause.
Long v. Jarratt, 94-444.
If no objection made to independent action, cannot be made for first time. —
An independent action upon au obligation to secure the payment of
money given upon a purchase under a judicial sale will not be enter
tained if the objection be made in apt time, the proper course being to
enforce the contract by a motion in the cause in which the sale was
decreed; but if the objection is not made at the proper time, the court
may proceed with the action. Such objection will not be entertained
when made for the first time in the supreme court. (The ruling in
Council v. Rivers, 65-54, on th's point, disapproved.) Lackey v. Pear
son, 101-651.
Motion treated as an action. —Under some circumstances a motion in the
cause may be treated as an indepeudant action to impeach a judgment.
Stradley v. King, 84-635.
Motion not treated as an action. —Where a motion in a cause, which had
been terminated by final judgment, was made, upon notice to the par
ties and supported by affidavits, but no pleadings had been filed, or
issues joined, or any consent entered to treat the motion as an indepen
dent action, it was error in the court, of its owu motion, and in its dis
cretion, to so consider and dispose of it, and the supreme court will, ex
mero motu, correct such error. Smith v. Fort, 105-446.
A motion in the canse not adequate, when.—The appointment of a trustee
by a judge of probate, in cases where the former trustee has died,
removed from the county, or become incompetent, cannot be done 011
an ex parte motion or petition. The application for such appointment
is in the nature of a civil action, and all persons interested must be made
parties, and have full time and opportunity to set up their respective
claims. Guion v. Melvin, 69-242.
A decree in the former court of equity, regularly enrolled and regis
tered, is final; and cannot be impeached by a motion in the cause.
Thaxton v. Williamson, 72-125; Covington v. Ingram, 64-123. The same
as to judgments of the former county courts. Peterson v. Vann, 83-118;
The right of a surety to be subrogated to the rights of his principal can .
only be asserted by an independent action. Calvert v. Peebles, 82-334.
The title to office cannot be tried by a motion. Sneed v. Bullock,
77-282.
Where the case is ended, the remedy (if any, after an acquiescence for
seven years), is not by motion, but by a new action commenced by sum
mons. Thompson v. Shamwell, 89-283.
The superior court has no jurisdiction upon petition, motion or sum
mary orders to direct the disposition of moneys paid into clerk's office
by executors, administrators and collectors under The Code, \ \ 1543 aid
1544. Cassidey ex parte, 95-225.
Where persons who werenot parties to the original suit are the con
testants in an issue of fraud alleged to have been perpetrated in the
course of the progress of the cause, the remedy must be sought by inde
pendent action. Mock v. Coggin, 101-366.
Upon motion in the cause, it appeared that the defendant railroad
company, by order of its board of directors and th'i action pursuant
thereto of its president and secretary, had confessed certain judgments
in favor of its president just prior to the road's going into the hands of
a receiver, the court below properly refused to consider any allegations
of fraud. These should be made in an independent action properly
coustitut *d for this purpose. Sharp v. Railroad, 106-308.
Defence to a motion .—A discharge in bankruptcy will not avail on a
motion to set aside an execution on a judgment obtained since the dis
charge. Paschall v. Bullock, 80-329.
When, in a motion to set aside a writ of assistance for want of notice,
it appears that the writ was granted in open court without objection
from the counsel for the defendant in possession, who was present at
the time: Held, that the motion should not be granted. Coor v. Smith,
107-430.
Renewal of motion. —A motion for an injunction or receiver, if refused,
cannot be renewed. Jones v. Thome, 80-72.
Nor a motion to issue execution on a dormant judgment. Sanderson
v. Daily, 83-67.
Nor a motion to discharge a party taken in arrest and bail. Roulhac
v. Brown, 87-1.
Nor a motion to set aside a judgment if made on the same grounds.
Mabry v. Henry, 83-298.
Motions made in the progress of a cause to facilitate the trial, but
which involve no substantial right, and the decision of which is not
subject to appeal, may be renewed as subsequent events require. The
doctrine of res judicata applies to motions affecting a substantial right,
and which may be the subject of appeal, but from the decision of which
no appeal is taken. Sanderson v. Daily, 83-67; Allison v. Whittier,
101-490.
The law does not tolerate successive proceedings merely upon newly
assigned reasons, when one and the same object is aimed at in all, but
the first decision will govern as res judicata Mabry v. Henry, 83-298.
A refusal of a motion by a judge not having jurisdiction does not bar
a renewal of the motion before the proper judge. Bank v. Wilson,
80-200.
After a motion to recall an execution and set aside a judgment has
been once heard and refused upon full evidence, it becomes res judicata.
Moore v. Grant, 92-316. •
See cases cited under \\ 274 and 412 (4), ante ; also, as regards motions
in Provisional Remedies, the various sections of Title IX, \\ 290 to 383
inclusive.
(2) Motions may be made to a clerk of a superior court,
or to a judge out of court ; except for a new trial on the
merits;
At chambers. —When a motion was heard at chambers, by consent, it
cannot be objected in the supreme court that it should have been heard
in term. Gatewood v. Leak, 99-363; Anthony v. Estes, 99-598.
Pending appeal. —A judge of the superior court can entertain no motion
in a cause upon the merits, which, by appeal, is in the supreme court.
Skinner v. Bland, 87-168; Isler v. Brown, 69-125.
NOTE.—This does not debar motions or orders upon incidental matters,
such as the preservation or investment of a fund pending the appeal
and the like. Hinson v. Adrian, 91-372; Green v. Griffin, 95-50.
In the supreme court.—The objection that the complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or want of jurisdiction,
may be taken by motion in the supreme court. Tucker v. Baker, 86-1;
Bryant v. Fisher, 85-71; Jones v. Coin'rs, 85-278.
See \ 550, ante, and rule 27 of the supreme court, post, and cases cited.
Before a justice of the peace.—Where a judgment of a justice of the
peace is for any reason void, it may be impeached either by motion
before him or by a recordari in the nature of a writ of false judgment.
(3) Motions must be made within the district in which
the action is triable;
Before the judge of another district. —The judge holding the courts of a
district, other than that in which a judgment is originally docketed,
canont entertain a motion to set it aside. Birdsey v. Harris, 68-92.
Out of the county. —Except by consent, or in those cases especially per
mitted by statute (granting injunctions, '4'i, 334. 337). the superior court
has no jurisdiction to hear a cause or a motion therein outside of the
county in which the action is pending. McNeill v. Hodges, 99-248.
The consent necessary to give jurisdiction to hear motions in a county
other than that in which the action is pending must affirmatively appear
in the record; aud if it does not, the error may be assigned in the
supreme court. Godwin v. Monds, 101-354.
Regularly, a motion to set aside a judgment should be made in the
county where judgment was rendered; but, where it appears that the
parties consented to have it heard in another, no objection can be taken
on that account. Skinner v. Terry, 107-103.
(4) A motion to vacate or modify a provisional remedy,
and an appeal from an order allowing a provisional remedy,
shall have preference over all other motions ;
(5) When any party intends to make or oppose a motion
in any court of record, and it shall be necessary for him to
have the affidavit of any person who shall have refused to
make the same, such court may, by order, appoint a referee
to take the affidavit or deposition of such person. Such
person may be subpoenaed and compelled to attend and
make an affidavit before such referee, the same as before a
referee to whom it is referred to try an issue ;
(6) Whenever a motion shall be made in any cause or
proceeding in any of the courts, to obtain an injunction
order, order of arrest, or warrant of attachment, granted in
any such case or proceeding, or a motion to vacate or modify
the same is made, it shall be the duty of the judge before
whom such motion is made, to render and make known
his decision on such motion within ten days after the day
upon which such motion shall or may be submitted to him
for decision.
Directory. —This section must necessarily be held merely directory, from
the impossibility of an appeal giving any redress, as regards the time
in which the judge shall file his decision. Childs v. Martin, 68-307.
During pendency of action.—An interlocutory order is always under the
control of the court during the pendency of the action. Shinn v. Smith,
79-310; Mebane v. Mebane, 80-34; Worth v. Gray, 59-4; Ashe v. Moore,
6-383; Miller v. Justice, 85-25; Welch v. Kingsland, 89-179.
Sec. 595. Notice of motion. C. C. 1'., s. :t40.
When notice of a motion is necessary, it must be served
ten days before the time appointed for the hearing; but the
court or judge may, by an order to show cause, prescribe
a shorter time.
Notice, when necessary. —An order to stay proceedings for a longer time
than twenty days, made by a judge at chambers, and without notice to
the adverse party, will be set aside on motion. Foard v. Alexander,
64-69. And in all proceedings before the clerk. Blue v. Blue, 79-69.
After a judgment fixing an administrator with assets and a return of
nulla bona thereon, the proper mode to subject him personally is by
motion on notice, and not by an action. McDowell v. Asbury," 66-444.
When a motion is made to set aside a judgment, notice must be given
to the adverse party. Seymour v. Cohen, 67-345: Sutton v. McMillan,
72-102; Lyon v. McMillan, 72-392.
Notice of an application to a court for leave to issue a ven. ex. —the
judgment having been obtained in 186(, and the last execution thereon
returned more than three years from the date of such application, and
the defendant therein being dead—must be served on the personal rep
resentative of such defendant. Aycock v. Harrison, 71-432.
It is error to grant an injunction staying execution on a judgment,
without notice to the plaintiff. Faison v. Mcllwaine, 72-312.
Notice not necessary, when. —No notice of a motion is required, when the
motion is made at a term when the cause stands regularly for trial.
Hemphill v. Moore, 104-379; Erwin v. Lowery, 64-321.
Neither \ 210, ante, nor the proviso in j> 237, ante, requires notice to be
given to the adverse party, on an application for permission to defend a
suit without giving the required security. Deal v. Palmer, 68-215.
The five days' notice which was required by (c218, C C P., previous
to a motion for judgment on account of a frivolous demurrer, answer or
reply, is not applicable since the Code of Civil Procedure has been sus
pended, and the summons in civil action is made returnable to the court
in term time. Now such notice is unnecessary, as the parties, through
their counsel, must take notice, at their peril, of all motions and steps
in the cause. Clayton v. Jones, 68-497.
Note. —As amended into \ 388, ante, the five days' notice is stricken
out.
When a judgment which has been standing for several terms, upon
which an execution had been issued and the land of defendant sold, has
been set aside upon motion of the defendant, it requires no notice of a
motion on the part of the plaintiff to revoke the order setting aside the
order, and to re-instate the same and the execution. Perrv v. Pearce,
68-367.
Parties fixed with notice, when. —Parties, once served with process, are
fixed with notice of all subsequent motions and orders in the cause.
Sparrow v. Davidson, 77-35; University v. Lassiter, 83-38.

.of record in the progress of the action, and of all the pleadings and
admissions of facts by his counsel. Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290; Stancill v. Gay, 92-455; Williams v. Whiting, 94-481; University v. Lassiter,
83-38; Coor v. Smith, 107-430.
All persons who have been duly made parties to an action will be
presumed to have notice of all orders, decrees, etc., therein subsequently
made, and will be estopped thereby, notwithstanding any irregularities
which may appear in the proceedings, until they shall have been
reversed or vacated on appeal, in some action instituted for that pur
pose. Spencer v. Credle, 102-68.
One who has been duly made party to a pending action is bound to
take notice of all motions, orders, etc., made therein during term time.
Special notice of motions, proceedings, etc., as for an injunction is only
required when made or to be heard out of term; but, in such cases, if
the opposing party voluntarily appears, in person or by attorney, he
will be ordinarily deemed to have waived notice. Where a party has
been prevented, by inadvertence or mistake, from making resistance of
such motions, etc., the court may, in its discretion, give him an oppor
tunity to be heard. Hemphill v. Moore, 104-379.
An order of court continuing the motion for alimony to a future term
of court, made in the presence of counsel for both parties is, sufficient
notice, under the statute, of such motion. Lea v. Lea, 104-603.
Parties not flxei with notice, when. —Though final judgment does not
terminate all connection of counsel with the case, notice of any motion
subsequent to that term of court must be served on them. Coor v. Smith,
107-430; Rogers v. McKenzie, 81-164; Branch v. Walker, 92-87; Allison
v. Whittier, 101-490.
Neither parties nor counsel are required to take notice of orders made
after the judge has left the court-house for the term. Branch v. Walker,
92-87.
Ordinarily, all parties to an action are presumed to have uotice of all
orders made therein, but this rule does not apply to an action pending
before 1868, and which has never been transferred to the new docket.
Dawkins v. Dawkins, 93-2S3. Nor to orders out of term. Blue v. Blue,
79-69.
Before the clerk. — Presumption of notice of a motion does not apply to
proceedings in the probate court. Blue v. Blue, 79-69.
If notice given is too short.—If not enough time is allowed, the motion
should be retained, not dismissed. Guiou v. Melvin, 69-242.
Does not apply. —This section does not apply to supplemental proceed
ings, as, by # 488-(i), the judge fixes time and place in the order. Weiller v. Lawrence, 81-65.
Sec. 596. Time, how computed. C. C. P, s. 348.

Service of summons.— Service of summons is in time if made on Friday,
the tenth day before court. Taylor v. Harris, 82-25.
Service by publication. —When publication "once a week for four weeks "
is required, publication on the four successive Mondays before court is
sufficient. The four weeks' publication is in lieu of the ten days' notice
required when summons is personally served, and not additional. Guil
ford v. Georgia, 109—.
In actions on judgments. —Where a judgment was rendered on 20th Octo
ber, 1873, and an action was brought on such judgment on 20th October,
1883: Held, the statute barring actions on a judgment (§ 152, ante), unless
commenced within ten years after rendition of the judgment, was a
defence to the action. Cook v. Moore, 95-1.
In appeals. —Time to file bond and serve case on appeal is counted from
the day of the actual adjournment of the court, and not from the day of
trial. Turrentine v. Railroad, 92-642; Walker v. Scott, 104-481; Chamblee v. Baker, 95-98; Worthy v. Brady, 91-265.
In re-hearings. —In counting the twenty days from the commencement
of the term of the supreme court within which an application to re-hear
may be filed, the first day of the term is excluded, and the last day also,
if it falls on Sunday. Barcroft v. Roberts, 92-249.
In penalty cases for detention of freight.—Under the statute (acts 1874-'5,
ch. 240, now The Code, 1967) which prescribes a forfeiture for a delay
of local shipment of freight for more than five days, five running days
are intended, and Sunday is counted as one of them, even when the last
day falls on Sunday. Branch v. Railroad, 77-347.
Under ch. 240, acts 1874-'5, making it unlawful to allow freight to remain
unshipped for more than five days, the railroad company would not incur
the penalty till the end of the sixth day, the law not regarding fractions
of a day in enforcing a penal statute. Sunday is counted as any other
day. Keeter v. Railroad, 86-346.
See \ 552, ante, and \ 602, post.

Notices shall be in writing ; notices and other papers
may be served on the party or his attorney personally,
where not otherwise provided in this chapter.
Requirements. —This section is of general application as to notices in
judicial proceedings, and its requirements are essential to a valid notice.
Allen v. Strickland, 100-225.
When a statute requires notice to be given, the notice must be in
writing, addressed to the proper person, contain an intelligent and suf
ficiently expressed statement of the matter to be communicated, signed
by the party giving it, or his attorney, served in such way that the court
can see that it has been served, and the original, or a copy properly
authenticated, returned into court. Ibid.
Service by mail. —Since The Code, there is no statute allowing judicial
notices to be served by mail, and in the absence of a statute such a ser
vice is void. Allen v. Strickland, 100-225.
Note. —Summons, notices and other process can be served on non
residents by mail—\ 218 (8), ante.
Service by one not an officer. —Service of a notice of appeal by one not
an officer is void. Such service is only valid as to a subpcena, and must
then be proven on oath. State v. Johnson, 109—.
Alias notice.—Semblc, if a notice is duly placed in the hands of a proper
officer, and he fails to serve it in time, an alias may be ordered. But a
notice served by the party in a manner not recognized by law is. in law,
no notice, and therefore no alias can be Ordered. Allen v. Strickland,
100-225.
See §§ 228 and 519, ante, and cases cited.
(1) If upon an attorney service may be made during his
absence from his office by leaving the paper with his clerk

there is no person in the office, by leaving it, between the
hours of six in the morning and nine in the evening, in a
conspicnous place in the office, or, if it be not open so as to
admit of such service, then by leaving it at the attorney's
residence with some person of suitable age and discretion;
On attorney. —A notice of a motion to set aside a judgment may be
properly served on the attorney of record of the opposing party.
Branch v. Walker, 92-87.
An attorney of record cannot withdraw from an action without leave
of court, and his relation to the matter continues till the judgment is
satisfied. Ibid.
Notice to an attorney of any matter relating to the business in which
he is engaged for his client is notice to the client. Hulbert v. Douglas,
94-122.
(2) If upon a party, it may be made by leaving the paper
at his residence, between the hours of six in the morning
and nine in the evening, with some person of suitable age
and discretion;
Return "executed."—A return by the sheriff on a notice to produce a
paper, in these words, "Executed by delivering a copy," implies a
delivery to each party to whom the notice is addressed, and is sufficient.
McDonald v. Carson, 94-497.
Left at residence. —A notice is properly served if left with wife of defend
ant at his residence within the hours prescribed by this section. Turner
v. Holden, 109—.
(3) If upon a person who cannot be found after due dili
gence, or who is not a resident of this state, the service
thereof may be made by the publication of the notice oner
a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper pub
lished in the county from which the notice is issued, and
if no newspaper be published therein, then in some news
paper published within the judicial district; and the proof
of service shall be as is required by law in the case of a
service of a summons by publication;
Time, how computed. —The time required for publication of summons
and notices is in lieu of the ten days necessary when there is personal
service, and not additional. Guilford v. Georgia, 109—.
(4) Service of a subpoena for witnesses maybe made by
a sheriff, coroner or constable, and proved by the return of
such officer, or the service may be made by any person not
a party to the action, and proved by his oath. A subpoena
for witnesses need not be signed by the clerk of the court.
It shall be sufficient if subscribed by the party or by his
attorney. This section shall not apply to the service of a
summons or other process, or of any paper to bring a party
into contempt.
Return of officer. —The return of the officer is sufficient evidence of the
service of a subpeena; and semble, of service of a notice of a motion,
also. Surratt v. Crawford, 87-372.
By one not an officer. —Service by one not an officer is valid only as to a
subpeena, and then must be proven on oath. State v. Johnson, 109—.
Sec. 598. Duty of sheriff and coroner in serving or execut
ing process, and how enforced ; may return process by
mail. C. C. P., s. 354.
Whenever the sheriff may be required to serve or exe
cute any summons, order or judgment, or to do any other
act, he shall be bound to do so in like manner as upon pro
cess issued to him, and shall be equally liable in all respects
for neglect of duty ; and if the sheriff be a party, the coro
ner shall be bound to perform the service, as he is now
bound to execute process where the sheriff is a party ; and
this chapter relating to sheriffs shall apply to coroners when
the sheriff is a party. Sheriffs and coroners may return pro
cess by mail. Their liabilities in respect to the execution
of process shall be as prescribed by law.
Officer not liable, when. —Where the summons sent by mail does not
reach the officer till six days before the sitting of the court to which it
is returnable, and it is served in two days thereafter, he is not liable to
amercement. Yeargin v. Wood, 83-326.
Beturn of officer. —The official acts and returns of a sheriff are acted on
without proof of his signature, in a court in which he is an officer. The
Code, \ 940; McDonald v. Carson, 94-497.
A single affidavit will not be sufficient to set aside his return. Hunter
v. Kirk, 71-277; Mason v. Miles, 63-564.
Special deputy. —A justice of the peace cannot deputize a special officer
to execute civil process. Marsh v. Williams, 63-371; State v. Barefoot,
89-565.
Irregular process. —Irregular process may be amended, but is no pro
tection to the plaintiff or officer, for acts done under it before amend
ment. Woody v. Jordan, 69-189.
Remedy against officer. —The duties and liabilities of a sheriff in regard
to the execution of process are nearly the same under The Code as
under the former system, but the procedure for enforcing a judgment
against him, is changed from a scire facias to a civil action and the
summons must issue from and be returnable to the same court as the
judgment. Jones v. Gupton, 65-28; Thompson v. Berry, 64-79; Tate v.
Powe, 64-644.
NoTe. —The remedy is now by motion, § 446, ante, and by civil action,
\\ 11 12, 2079 and 2088.
Amercement of $100, and not a civil action, is the remedy given
against a sheriff for not making "due and proper" return of process.
The Code, \\ 446 and 2079; Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
For a false return or neglecting or refusing to return criminal process
or assuming to act as sheriff without authority, there is a qui tam civil
action for Jioo. The Code, §1112. Harrell v. Warren, 100-259; Mfg.
Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
An action for $500 for false return in a civil proceeding is allowed
against a sheriff by The Code, \ 2079. Harrell v. Warren, 100-259; Mfg.
Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
A qui tam action for $200 lies for selling contrary to law (\ 461, ante.)
An action for damages is further allowed by The Code, \ 2079. Mfg.
Co. v. Buxton, 105-74.
An action for damages lies for refusing or neglecting to lay off home
stead and personal property exemptions (§ 516, ante); or for conspiring
with debtor or creditor (jj§ 517, 518, ante).
For duties and liabilites of officer in serving process under the former
system, see Battle's Digest, vol 2, pp. 1065, 1092; vol. 4, pp. 447, 454.
For duties of sheriffs as to service of process, see Code, 11 12, 2078,
2083, 2086, 2088.
For duties of coroner in serving process, see Code, \ 658.
Sec. 599. Powers of referees. C. C. P., s. 356.
Every referee shall have power to administer oaths in any
proceeding before him, and shall have generally the power
vested in a referee by law.
A referee has power to enforce obedience to his rulings, on the trial
of the issues before him, just as the court would have upon the trial
before it. But a reference under supplementary proceedings is not a
trial and such referee cannot punish a witness for refusing to testify.
LaFontaine v. Underwriters, 83-132.
See §422, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 600. Paper lost or withheld, copy to be used. C. C. P.,

fication of the sureties, shall be delivered by the sheriff, or
filed as therein provided.
Sec. 602. Time for publication of notices, how computed.
C. C. P., s. 35».

puted so as to exclude the first day of publication and

Construed.—This section construed. Guilford v. Georgia, 109—.
See 11 219, 350, 352 and 596, ante.
Sec. 003. Scire facias and quo warranto abolished, and
this chapter substituted. C. C. P., s. 302. K. ft, c. 20,
s*. 5, 25.
,
The writ of scire facias, the writ of quo warranto, and
proceedings by information in the nature of quo warranto,
are abolished ; and the remedies obtainable in those forms
may be obtained by civil actions under this sub-chapter.
Statutes abolishing sci. fa.'s. —An ordinance of the convention abolish
ing the writ of scire facias does not impair the obligation of a contract,
but simply takes from the creditor the additional remedy provided by
statute, and leaves him his common law remed}-. Parker v. Shannonhouse, 61-209; Bingham,*'. Richardson, 61-315; Mardre v. Felton, 61-279:
Riddick v. Hinton, 61-291.
The ordinance providing that every scire facias to revive a judgment
shall be dismissed on motion, where the defendant failed to make any
defence to the sci. fa. or motion to dismiss it, a judgment taken thereon
against him is regular and valid. Kingsbury v. Hughes, 61-328.
Writs of scire facias consisted of two classes, one to remedy defects
in, or to continue, an action; the other to commence some proceeding.
Proceedings in the nature of a sci. fa. of the first class are indispensa
ble in the administration of justice, and as to that class the object of the
C. C. P. is merely to abolish the form and name of the writ, and to sim
plify the process into a notice to show cause why further proceedings
should not be had. McDowell v. Asbury, 66-444.
Motion, and not civil action, substituted for sci. fa. —After a judgment fix
ing an executor with assets and a return of an execution issued thereon
unsatisfied, the proper mode to subject such executor personally, is by
motion founded on notice, and not by civil action. McDowell v. Asbury.
66-444.
The proper method of enforcing a judgment nisi is by action, or spe
cial proceedings commenced by summons. Thompson v. Berry, 64-79;
Jones v. Gupton, 65-48. [Note. —This is now changed, $446, ante.]
See it'i 446 and 594, ante, and cases cited.
Motion for leave to issue executiop. —Motion for leave to issue execution
after the lapse of three years is a substitute for sci. fa. McDonald v.
Dickson, 85-248; Berry v. Corpening, 90-395.
Trial of title to office. — A civil action in the nature of a quo warranto
brought 111 the name of the people by the attorney general, on the rela
tion of the party aggrieved, is the proper remedy to test the validity of
an election, or the right to a public office. Saunders v. Gatling, 81-298;
Davis v. Moss, 81-303; Brown v. Turner, 70-93; Moore v. Jones, 76-182;
Swain v. McRae, 80-1 11.
Revising return of canvassing board. — Proceedings may be had under this
chapter to revise the returns of the board of canvassers. Peebles v.
Davie, 82-385.
Sec. 004. Action may be brought by attorney general to
vacate a charter, by direction of the legislature. C. C. P.,
s. 303. 1889, c. 533.
An action may be brought by the attorney general, in
the name of the state, whenever the legislature shall so
direct, against a corporation for the purpose of vacating or
annulling the act of incorporation, or an act renewing its
corporate existence, or its letters of incorporation, on the
ground that such act or renewal, or such letters of incor
poration, were procured upon some fraudulent suggestion, or
concealment of a material fact, by the person incorporated,
or by some of them, or with their knowledge and consent.
Note.—The words " letters of incorporation," in lines five and seven,
were added by ch. 533, acts 1889.
Sec. 605. Action to annul a corporation, when and how
brought by the attorney general, by leave of the supreme
court. C. C. P., s. 304. R. C, c. 20, s. 25. 188!), c. 533.
An action may be brought by the attorney general in the
name of the state, on leave granted by the supreme court
or a justice thereof, for the purpose of vacating the charter
or letters of incorporation or annulling the existence of a
corporation, other than municipal, whenever such corpora
tion shall—
(1) Offend against the act or acts creating, altering, or
renewing such corporation, or against its letters or plan of
incorporation; or,
(2) Violate any law by which such corporation shall have
forfeited its charter or letters of incorporation by abuse of
its powers; or,
(3) Whenever it shall have forfeited its privileges or fran
chises by failure to exercise its power ; or,
(4) Whenever it shall have done or omitted any act which
amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights, privileges
and franchises; or,
(5) Whenever it shall exercise a franchise or privilege
not conferred upon it by law:
(6) For non-user of its powers for two or more years
consecutively;
(7) For insolvency, manifested by the return of an exe
cution unsatisfied, upon a judgment against the company
docketed in the superior court of the county where it has
its entry or principal place of business.
And it shall be the duty of the attorney general, when
ever he shall have reason to believe that any of these acts
or omissions can be established by proof, to apply for leave,
and upon leave granted, to bring the action, in every case
of public interest, and also in every other case in which
satisfactory security shall be given to indemnify the state
against the costs and expenses to be incurred thereby.
Note. —The addition of the words "letters of incorporation," wherever
they appear above, was made by ch. 533, acts 1889.
This procaeding necessary, when.—A corporation cannot endure longer
than the time prescribed by its charter, and no judicial proceedings are
necessary to declare a forfeiture for such cause, but for any other cause
a direct proceeding must be instituted, and the forfeiture cannot be taken
advantage of collaterally. Asheville Division v. Aston, 92-578.
Interpleader.—In a proceeding to annul a charter, the court may per
mit a creditor of the corporation to interplead. Attorney General v.
Simonton, 78-57.
Sec. 606. Leave, how obtained. C. C. P., s. 365.
Leave to bring the action may be granted upon the appli
cation of the attorney general; and the court or justice,
may, at discretion, direct notice of such application to be
given to the corporation or its officers, previous to granting
such leave, and may hear the corporation in opposition
thereto.
Sec. 007. Action upon information or complaint. C. C.
P., 8. 300.
An action may be brought by the attorney general in the
name of the state, upon his own information, or upon the
complaint of any private party, against the parties offend
ing in the following cases:
(1) When any person shall usurp, intrude into, or unlaw
fully hold or exercise any public office, civil or military, or
any franchise within this state, or any office in a corpora
tion created by the authority of this state; or,
(2) When any public officer, civil or military, shall have
done or suffered an act which, by law, shall made a for
feiture of his office; or,
(3) When an association or number of persons shall act
within this state as a corporation, without being duly incor
porated.
See \ 610, post, as amended.
Quo warranto the proper remedy to try title to office. —A civil action in the
nature of a quo warranto is the proper remedy to try the right to a public
office. Saunders v. Catling, 81-298; Davis v. Moss, 81-303; People v.
Wilson, 72-155; People v. Hilliard, 72-169; State v. Norman, 82-687;
Deloatch v. Rogers, 86-357; Ellison v. Raleigh, 89-125.
Note. —These and other decisions of similar import seem contrary to
the provisions abolishing the distinction in forms of actions. The decision
in Haymore v. Commissioners, 85-268, seems more consonant to the new
system. Quo warranto and mandamus are not now forms of actions, but
forms of relief, and any relief should be granted which is justified by the
facts proven, and not inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint.
The right of a de facto officer to hold his office cannot be questioned
collaterally—as here, by objecting to an answer purporting to have been
sworn to before him. Culver v. Eggers, 63-630.
The provisional remedy of injunction does not apply to cases of the
usurpation of a public office, but is confined to cases where some private
right is a subject of coutroversy, and the act sought to be restrained
would produce injury to the alleged right of the plaintiff during the liti
gation. Patterson v. Hubbs, 65-119.
When the question of the right, or title to an office, is put in issue,
mandamus is not the form of action, the appropriate remedy being an
action in the nature of quo warranto; nor will mandamus lie, when two
persons claim the same duty adversely to each other, against a third
party. Brown v. Turner, 70-93; Hannon v. Com'rs, 89-123.
Nor can the title to office be tried by motion. Sneed v. Bullock, 77-282.
Qucere, whether a mandamus can be used under any circumstances to
try the title to an office. Houston v. State, 66-231.
See \ 623, post, and cases there cited.
Form of the action. —When the subject of a controversy is the right to
a public office, the action should be brought by the attorney general,
under this section, in the nan;e of the people of the state; and if it be
against a person for usurping a public office, the attorney general, in
addition to the statement of the cause of action, "may also set forth in
the complaint the name of the person rightfully entitled to the office,
with a statement of his right thereto; and in such case, upon proof by
affidavit that the defendant has received fees or emoluments belonging
to the office, and by means of his usurpation thereof, an order may be
granted by a judge of the supreme court for the arrest of such defend
ant and holding him to bail," as in other civil actions where the defend
ant is subject to arrest. Patterson v. Hubbs, 65-119.
Note.—The word "supreme" has been amended to "superior" in
$ 609, post, referred to in the above decision.
An action by the attorney general in the name of the people of the
state, and of the person who claims the office of sheriff, is the proper
mode of proceeding against the person who is alleged to be usurping it,
to try the question as to which of the parties are entitled to the office.
Loftin v. Sowers, 65-251.
An action to try the right of an incumbent to any public office may
be brought by the attorney general upon his own information or upon
the complaint of any private party. People v. Hilliard, 72-169.
An action brought as follows— "T. L. Hargrove, attorney general of
North Carolina, in the name of the people of said state, and upon the
relation of N. N. Tuck v.," etc. —is well brought, and no advantage can
be taken of it on demurrer. Tuck v. Hunt, 73-24.
An action against a judge of probate to vacate his office for failure to
attend to his office, under <>? 1 and 2 of ch. 136, acts of i87i-'2, is prop
erly brought by the attorney general in the name of the people of the
state, by virtue of this section of The Code. People v. Heaton, 77-18;
State v. Norman, 82-687.
Declaration of result by canvassers only prima facie. —The declaration of
the result of an election by the board of canvassers establishes a prima
facie right in favor of such person, but is conclusive only of the right to
be inducted into office, but does not exclude the jurisdiction of the
proper courts to examine and determine the correctness and sufficiency
of the returns and the true result of the election. Gatling v. Boone,
98-573Such declaration is conclusive on county commissioners, unless the
person is ineligible. Hanuon v. Grizzard, 96-293; S. C, 99-161.
The court can go behind the returns. —Where the election returns from a
polling precinct failed to show for what office the votes cast for certain
candidates were given, and the county canvassing board refused to con
sider such returns, the superior court, on a quo warranto, can look
behind the precinct returns to ascertain for whom the votes were cast.
Deberry v. Nicholson, 102-465.
Burden of proof upon relator. —The return of an election, properly certi
fied by the persons authorized to hold it, throws the burden of proving
the return incorrect upon the party alleging it. Roberts v. Calvert,
98-58°The test of a public office. —The true test of a public office is, that it is a
parcel of the administration of government, civil or military, or is itself
created directly by the law-making power, and an information in the
nature of a quo warranto only will lie to recover the same. Eliason v.
Coleman, 86-235.
A public office is an agency for the state, and the person whose duty
it is to perform that agency, is a public officer. Nor does it make any
difference whether he receives a salary and fees and takes an oath, these
being mere incidents and no part of the office itself. Nor is it material
whether one act, or a series of acts are required to be done. Clark v.
Stanly, 66-59.
De facto officer. —To constitute an officer de facto it is requisite that
there be some colorable election or appointment to and induction into the
office. Van Amringe v. Taylor, 108-196; Burke v. Elliott, 26-361; Gil
liam v. Reddick, 26-368; Burton v. Patton, 47-124; Commissioners v.
McDaniel, 52-107; Norfleet v. Staton, 73-546; Kesler v. Newbern,
61-505; State v. Lewis, 107-967.
Essential to validity of an election. —It is essential to the validity of an
election that it shall be held under some proper authority and conducted
substantially in the manner prescribed by law.
Invalid election. —The election of a person to an office which does not
exist or in which there is no vacancy is a nullity. Rhodes v. Hampton,
101-629.
Decisions as to title to office. —The act of the general assembly, passed
April 6, 1871, giving to the president of the senate and the speaker of
the house of representatives, the power to appoint "all proxies and
directors in all corporations in which the state has an interest," creates
a public office, and fills the same by appointment of the legislature. It
is, therefore, unconstitutional. Clark v. Stanly, 66-59.
The directors of the institution for the deaf and dumb and the blind
are officers, made so by the constitution, and so called. The legislature
has no right to appoint such directors. Nichols v. McKee, 68-429.
By virtue of article 3, \ 10, of the constitution, the governor shall
nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of a majority of the
senators elect, appoint the directors of the penitentiary, and such other
officers as are therein prescribed. Welker v. Bledsoe, 68-457.
An officer elected by the people, holding over his regular term, on
account of the failure of his successor to qualify, holds over until the
place is filled at " the next general election" by the people. Battle v.
Mclver, 68-467.
A clerk who held over from the day of a general election, to-wit, the
first Thursday in August, until the first Monday in the ensuing Septem
ber, when his successor was installed, was at least clerk de facto; and
his acts cannot be collaterally impeached, and are valid as between third
parties. Threadgill v. Railroad, 73-178.
The appointment, to fill a vacancy, of a clerk of the superior court by
the defacto judge of the superior court, holding the courts of the dis
trict, is valid, and such clerk cannot be ousted as an usurper by the
appointee of the dejure judge. Norfleet v. Staton, 73-546.
One who professes to be the incumbent of an office, and performs the
duties of the same, is estopped from denying the legality of his appoint
ment. State v. Long, 76-254.
A forfeiture of office and a vacancy can be judicially declared only
after trial and culpability established. Therefore, the office of sheriff
does not become vacant by failure of the incumbent to renew his bond.
Vann v. Pipkin, 77-408.
Public printer. —The act of 1869-'70, ch. 43, repeals the act establishing
the office of public printer; and the public printer, as now provided for,
is not an officer within the meamng of the constitution. Brown v.
Turner)u70-93.
Act held unconstitutional. —The legislature cannot authorize the presid
ing officers of its two brances to appoint proxies and directors, in behalf
of the state in corporations in which the state has an interest; nor can
the legislature itself make such appointments, for the reason that it
would be an usurpation of executive power. Howertoh v. Tate, 68-546.
Sec. 608. When attorney general to grant leave to private
relator to bring action. 187'i-'5, c. 70. s. 1. 1881, c. 3X0.
When application shall be made to the attorney general
by a private relator to bring such an action, he shall grant
leave for the same to be brought in the name of the state,
upon the relation of such applicant, upon his tendering to
the attorney general satisfactory security to indemnify the
state against all costs and expenses, which may accrue in
consequence of the bringing of such action.
Action, how brought. —Any person, having a right to an office, can, in
his own name, bring an action for the purpose of testing his right as
against one claiming adversely. Brown v. Turner, 70-93.
Contra.—Such action must be brought in the name of the people of
the state by the attorney general on the relation of the party aggrieved.
Saunders v. Gatling, 81-298, and several cases there cited.
Note.—The word "may" has been changed into "shall," and the
attorney general cannot now refuse leave, if the requisites of this sec
tion are complied with.
Against whom quo warranto can be maintained.—Entering into a bond, or
taking an oath of office, are acts which constitute such a user or intru
sion, as will support an action in the nature of quo warranto. Brown v.
Turner, 70-93.
Sec. OOO. Complaint and arrest of defendant, in action for
usurping an office. C. C. P., s. :i(S9. 1883, c. 102.

for usurping an office, the attorney general, in addition to
the statement of the cause of action, may also set forth in
the complaint the name of the person rightfully entitled to
the office, with a statement of his right thereto ; and in
such case, upon proof by affidavit that the defendant has
received fees or emoluments belonging to the office, and by
means of his usurpation thereof, an order shall be granted
by a judge of the superior court for the arrest of such defend
ant, and holding him to bail ; and thereupon he shall be
arrested and held to bail in the same manner, aud with the
same effect, and subject to the same rights and liabilities,
as in other civil actions where the defendant is subject to
arrest.
Complaint. —Where the complaint sets forth the whole number of votes
cast, and alleged that the relator received a certain number (which was
a majority) and was duly elected, is a sufficient allegation that the rela
tor received a majority of the votes cast. Hancock v. Hubbs, 98-589.
Where the complaint alleges that the relator was duly elected by a
majority over the defendant, it is not necessary to allege that he received
a majority of the legal votes cast. Hahn v. Stinson, 98-591.
The complaint need not allege in what respect the county canvassers
«rred in rejecting the returns from particular voting places. Kilburn v.
Patterson, 98-593.
Right to fees. —When the subject of a controversy is the right to a pub
lic office, the action should be brought by the attorney general in the
name of the people of the state; and if it be against a person for usurp
ing a public office, the attorney general, in addition to the statement of
the cause of action, "may also set forth in the complaint the name of
the person rightfully entitled to the office, with a statement of his right
thereto; and in such case, upon proof by affidavit that the defendant
has received fees or emoluments belonging to the office, and by means of
his usurpation thereof, an order may be granted by a judge of the
supreme court for the arrest of such defendant,- and holding him to
bail," as in other civil actions where the defendant is subject. to arrest.
Patterson v. Hubbs, 65-119.
A person who is rightfully entitled to an office, although not in the
actual possession thereof, has a property therein, and may niaintaiu an
action for money had and received, against a mere intruder, who may
perform the duties of such office for a time and receive the fees arising
therefrom; and such intruder cannot retain any part of the fees as a
compensation for his labor. Howerton v. Tate, 70-161.
Action abates. —Such an action abates on the death of the plaintiff rela
tor. See obiter dictum. Tate v. Morehead, 65-681.
Fees cannot be subjected to payment of debts. —The emoluments of a pub
lic office are not subject to any judicial process at the instance of cred
itors. Swepson v. Turner, 76-115.
NOTE —The words "supreme court," formerly in this section, have
been amended into "superior court."
Sec. 610. Judgment in such actions. Mandamus to issue;
supersedeas bond. C. C. P., s. 370. lStiii, c. 406.
In every such case judgment shall be rendered upon the
right of the defendant, and also upon the right of the party
so alleged to be entitled, or only upon the right of the
defendant, as justice shall require. Whenever in any civil
action brought under sections six hundred and seven and
six hundred and eight of The Code, to try the title or right
to hold any office, the judgment of the court shall be in
favor of the relator in such action, it shall be the duty of
the court to issue a writ of mandamtis or other process in
such action which may be necessary and proper to carry
such judgment into effect, and to induct the party so enti
tled into such office. No appeal by the defendant from the
judgment of the superior court in such action to the
supreme court shall stay the execution of .the judgment,
unless a justified undertaking be executed on the part of
the appellant by one or more sureties, in a sum to be fixed
by the court, conditioned that the appellant will pay to the
party entitled to the same the salary, fees, emoluments and
all money whatsoever received by such appellant by virtue
or under color of his said office : Provided, that in no event
shall said judgment be executed pending said appeal, unless
a justified undertaking be executed on the part of the appel
lee by one or more persons in a sum to be fixed by the
court, conditioned that the appellee will pay to the party
entitled to the same the salary, fees, emoluments and all
moneys whatsoever received by the appellee by virtue or
under color of his said office during his occupancy thereof.
Note. —All of the above section after the word " require " in line four
was added by ch., 406, acts 1885.
When action not brought on complaint of a contestant.—Where the action is
brought by the attorney general on his own information and not on the
complaint of a contestant, the judgment is rendered only in respect to
the right of the defendant. People v. Hilliard, 72-169.
Sec. (ill. Assumption of office, etc., by relator, when judg
ment in his favor. C. C. P., 8. 371.
If the judgment be rendered upon the right of the per
son so alleged to be entitled, and the same be in favor of
such person, he shall be entitled, after taking the oath of
office, and executing such official bond as may be required
by law, to take upon himself the execution of the office ;
and it shall be his duty, immediately thereafter, to demand
of the defendant in the action all the books and papers in
his custody, or within his power, belonging to the office
from which he shall have been excluded.
Sec. (112. Proceeding against defendant on refusal to de
liver books or papers. C. C. P., s. 372If the defendant shall refuse or neglect to deliver over
such books or papers, pursuant to the demand, he shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and the same proceedings shall
be had, and with the same effect, to compel delivery of such
books and papers as are prescribed by law.
Sec. 613. Damages, how recovered. V. C. P., s. 373.
If judgment be rendered, upon the right of the person so
alleged to be entitled, in favor of such person, he may
recover by action the damages which he shall have sus
tained by reason of the usurpation by the defendant of the
office from which such defendant has been excluded.
Damages may be recovered. —Compensation in damages may be recovered,
in an action subsequent to the judgment in the quo warranto, for the
time the office has been wrongfully withheld. Swain v. McRae, 80-111;
Jones v. Jones, 80-127.
A judgment in a quo warranto rendered after the term of office has
expired cannot put the relator in the office, but it will lay the founda
tion for another action for the damages. Jones v. Jones, 80-127.
A person who is rightfully entitled to an office, although not in actual
possession thereof, has a property therein, and may maintain an action
for money had and received, against a mere intruder, who may perform
the duties of the office for a time and receive the fees arising therefrom;
and such intruder cannot retain any part of the fees as a compensation
for his labor. Howerton v. Tate, 70-161.
Sec. 014. One action against several persons claiming office

poration, against whom such action shall have been brought,
shall be adjudged guilty of usurping or intruding into, or
unlawfully holding or exercising any office, franchise or
privilege, judgment shall be rendered that such defendant
be excluded from such office, franchise or privilege, and
also that the plaintiff recover costs against such defendant.
The court may also, in its discretion, fine such defendant a
sum not exceeding two thousand dollars, which fine, when
collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the state.
Where the claim is bona fide, no fine will be imposed.—This section author
izes the court, .in its discretion, to fine the defendant two thousand dol
lars, but where the party goes in under a bona fide claim of right and
without criminal intent the court is averse to imposing any fine.
Sec. 616. Trial in such cases to be expedited ; depositions.
1874-'o, c. 173. 1889, c. 428.
All actions to try the title, or right to any office, state,
county or municipal, shall stand for trial at the return term
of the summons, if a copy of the complaint shall have been
served with the summons, at least ten days before the return
day thereof ; and it shall be the duty of the judges to expe
dite the. trial of such actions, and to give them precedence
over all other actions, civil or criminal. But it shall be
unlawful to appropriate any public funds to the payment of
counsel fees in any such action. In all cases now pending
or hereafter to be brought in any county of this state for
the purpose of trying the title to the office of clerk of the
superior court, register of deeds, county treasurer or sheriff
of any county, it shall be competent and lawful to take the
deposition of witnesses before a commissioner or commis
sioners to be appointed by the judge of the district wherein
the case is to be tried, .or the judge holding the court of
said district, or the clerk of the court wherein the case is
pending, under the same rules as to time of notice and as
to the manner of taking and filing the same, as is now pro
vided by law for the taking of depositions in other cases;
and such depositions, when so taken, shall be competent to
be read on the trial of such action, without regard to the
place of residence of such witness, or distance of residence
from said place of trial: Provided, that the provisions of this
act shall not be construed to prevent the oral examination
of such witnesses by either party on the trial as they may
summon in their behalf.
Note. —All of this section after the word "action," in line nine, was
added by c'h. 428, acts 18S9.
Sec. 617. Judgment of forfeiture against a corporation.
C. C. P., s. 376.
If it shall be adjudged that a corporation against which
an action shall have been brought, has forfeited by neglect,
abuse, or surrender, its corporate rights, privileges and
franchises, judgment shall be rendered that the corpora
tion be excluded from such corporate rights, privileges and
franchises, and that the corporation be dissolved.
Sec. 618. Costs against corporation or persons claiming to
be such, how collected. C. C. P., s. 377.
If judgment be rendered in such action against a corpo
ration, or against persons claiming to be a corporation, the
court may cause the costs therein to be collected by execu
tion against the persons claiming to be a corporation, or by
attachment or process against the directors or other officers
of such corporation.
Sec. O1ft. Restraining corporation and appointment of
receiver. C. C. P., s. 378.

ration, the court shall have power to restrain the corpora
tion, to appoint a receiver of its property, and to take an
account, and make a distribution thereof among its cred
itors; and it shall be the duty of the attorney general
immediately after the rendition of such judgment to insti
tute proceedings for that purpose.
Receiver appointed, when. —Where a corporation has dissolved and there
is a contest as to the rights of different creditors to the assets, there
being no officers of the corporation, a receiver should be appointed.
Dobson v. Simonton, 78-63.
An order appointing a receiver of the extinct corporation, where it
has become extinct by a legislative enactment which transferred its powers
and property to a new corporation, cannot properly be made except in a
proceeding to which its successor or substitute is a party. Young v.
Rollins, 85-485.
See \ 379, ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 620. Copy of judgment-roll, where to be filed. C.C.P.,

feited to the state, or to any officer for its use, an action for
the recovery of such property, alleging the grounds of the
forfeiture; may be brought by the proper officer in any

Unclaimed dividends. —The provisions of ch. 236, laws of i874-'5, which
enacts: "That all dividends heretofore declared, or which shall hereafter
be declared by any corporation, company or association, whether char
tered or not, which shall not be recovered or claimed by suit by the par
ties entitled thereto, for five years after the same were or shall be declared,
shall be paid by the corporation, etc., to the trustees of the University,"
are in conflict with art. ix, 1.6 of the constitution. The word "dividend,"
as used in that section of the constitution, is synonymous with "distribu
tive shares," and is used as a convertible term meaning the same thing,
viz: "dividends or distributive shares of the estates of deceased per
sons." University v. Railroad, 76-103.
NoTE. —This section of the constitution has since been materially
changed.
See, for former practice in quo warranto, Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp.
902, 909.
Sec. 622. Application for writs of mandamus. 1871-'2,
c. 75.
All applications for writs of mandamus shall be made by
summons and complaint, and the complaint shall be duly
verified.
An ordinary process. —There is now but one form of action and man
damus is but a process of the court in that action. Belmont v. Reilly.
The writ can only be used by express order of a court of superior
jurisdiction and is not governed by the rules prescribed for the prosecu
tion of ordinary legal remedies. State v. Jones, 23-129; Lutterloh v.
Commissioners, 65-403.
Overruled. —Mandamus is not now a prerogative or extraordinary
writ, but a writ of right to be used as ordinary process in any case to
to which it is applicable. Haymore v. Commissioners, 85-268; Brown
v. Turner, 70-93.
Complaint. —A complaint in an action for mandamus to compel the
levying of a tax to pay a debt, which fails to set forth the debt specific
ally for which the relief is demanded, is defective. Blanton v. Commis
sioners, 101-532.
Action against county. — An action n.ay be maintained against the county
commissioners establishing a debt against the county without asking for
a writ of mandamus, where it appears that the county has property sub
ject to trusts, or such as c.in be reached only by proceedings supplemen
tal to execution. Hughes v. Commissioners, 107-528.
Proceedings in mandamus. —The proceedings in mandamus will conform
to the practice heretofore, so far as may be necessary to prevent a failure
of justice. Lutterloh v. Commissioners, 65-403.

Sec. H23. Manner in which summons for application for
writs of mandamus shall issue. 187 I-'2, c. 75, ss. 2, 3.
In all such applications, when the plaintiff seeks to enforce
a money demand, the summons, pleadings and practice shall
be the same as is prescribed for civil actions. When the
plaintiff seeks relief other than the enforcement of a money
demand, the summons shall be made returnable before a
judge of the superior court at chambers, or in term at a day
specified in the summons, not less than ten days after the
service of the summons and complaint upon the defendant,
at which time the court, except for good cause shown, shall
proceed to hear and determine the action, both as to law
and fact: Provided, that when an issue of fact is raised by
the pleading, it shall be the duty of the court, upon the
motion of either party, to continue the action until said
issue of fact can be decided by a jury at the next regular
term of the court.
Applied for in, and returnable to, term. —Mandamus must be moved for,
and be made returnable, in term time. Howerton v. Tate, 66-231.
Note. —This is otherwise now by above section.
For a money demand. —In applications for a mandamus for a money
demand, the summons is returnable in term. In all other applications
for mandamus, the summons is returnable at chambers. State v. Com
missioners, 70-137.
An application for a mandamus to cause taxes to be levied to pay
accrued interest is an application to enforce a money demand, and a
judge at chambers has no jurisdiction thereof. Belmont v. Reilly, 71-260.
In an application for a writ of mandamus to enforce the payment of a
money demand, the summons must be returned to term time and the
cause conducted as in civil actions. In applications for the writ to
enforce other demands, the summons shall be returned before the judge
at chambers, who may hear and determine both the law and the facts.
Rogers v. Jenkins, 98-129.
Demand necessary. —In an action against the board of commissioners
of a county, a demand is necessary, without regard to the fact whether
the claim is expressed to be payable at any particular time or place; and,
in a mandamus, the writ should show expressly, by the averment of a
demand and refusal, or an equivalent, that the prosecutor, before his
application to the court, did all in his power to obtain redress. Alexan, dcr v. Commissioners, 67-330.
Venue. —Scmble, that proceedings by mandamus against the commis
sioners of a county should be instituted in their own county. Johnston
v. Commissioners, 67-101; Alexander v. Commissioners, 67-330.
Mandamus against a board of county commissioners must be sued out
in the county of which they are commissioner^, unless the venue is
waived. Edwards v. Commissioners, 70-571.
Against whom mandamus will issue. —When a peremptory mandamus
issues against a board of commissioners, and there is a change in the
individual members of said board between its issue and service, those
composing such board when it is served must obey it. Pegram v. Com
missioners, 64-557.
It is improper to join the public treasurer with the auditor in an appli
cation for a mandamus, when the plaintiff has obtained no warrant from
the auditor. Bouer v. Adams, 65-639.
A mandamus against the commissioners of a county should run against
them as "a board," and not against the individuals composing such
board. Thomas v. Commissioners, 66-522.
In an action of mandamus, instituted against the justices of a county,
commissioners elected under the constitution cannot be substituted as
parties, ami this error is not waived by answer, but may be taken advan
tage of at any stage of the proceedings. Thomas v. Com'rs, 66-522.
School committeemen are public officers, and a mandamus lies against
them to compel them to give an order on the county treasurer for a sum
due for the services of a teacher employed by them. Robinson v. How
ard, 84-151; Taylor v. School Committee, 50-98.
When mandamus lies.— Mandamus lies against the governor to issue his
warrant for an officer's salary, or to do any other act purely ministerial.
Cotten v. Ellis, 52-545.
A plaintiff who has obtained a judgment against a county is not enti
tled to an execution against it. His remedy is by a writ of mandamus
against the board of commissioners of the county, to compel them to
142; Pegram v. Com'rs, 64-557; Lutterloh v. Com'rs, 65-403; Winslow v.
Com'rs, 64-218.
Mandamus is the proper remedy to compel the public treasurer to
issue bonds authorized by act of assembly or ordinance of a convention.
Railroad v. Jenkins, 65-173.
Where a legislative act directs an executive officer to do a specific act,
which does not involve any official discretion, upon his refusal, a man
damus will be ordered. Railroad v. Jenkins, 68-502.
Where a county is divided, and the new county is to pay its pro rata
of the debt, should it fail to do so, the commissioners of the original
county can, from time to time, have a mandamus to compel the payment
by the new county of its part of the interest on the debt, and of the prin
cipal when due. Craven v. Pamlico, 73-298.
Mandamus lies to compel a canvassing board to correct their returns.
Moore v. Jones, 76-182.
A mandamus is the appropriate remedy to enforce payment of a
demand against a municipal corporation whose only resource to meet
such a demand lies in the exercise of the taxing power conferred by
statute. Leach v. Com'rs, 84-829.
Mandamus will lie to compel public officers to discharge a mere min
isterial duty not involving any official discretion. County Board v. State
Board, 106^81.
If the board of county commissioners refuse to consider a creditor's
claim, the proper remedy is by mandamus to compel action on the sub
ject. Koonce v. Com'rs, 106-192.
Ordinarily, the only remedy of a judgment creditor against a county,
is a writ of mandamus to compel its commissioners to levy a tax to pay
the debt. A writ of mandamus will be granted only where one demand
ing it shows that he has a specific legal right, and has no other specific
legal remedy adequate to enforce it. Hughes v. Com'rs, 107-528.
When mandamus does not He.—A mandamus does not lie to compel the
clerk of the court to issue an execution on a judgment. The remedy
may be either by a rule upon him to compel him to perform his duty
under penalty of an attachment for contempt, or by a smt upon his bond.
Gooch v. Gregory, 65-142.
Mandamus will not lie to compel the public treasurer to pay money
on any claim against the state until the same has been passed upon and
a warrant issued by the auditor for that purpose, nor if the legislature
has forbidden a warrant to issue. Bayne v. Jenkins, 66-356; Boner v.
Adams, 65-639.
Nor does a mandamus lie to compel a recount by a county canvassing
board where the board of state canvassers has acted upon the returns,
and the remedy asked for would be unavailing. O'Hara v. Powell, 80-103.
A mandamus does not lie against a board of county canvassers and
the officer declared elected by them, to compel a recount of the vote.
The proper remedy is by a qno warranto. Swain v. McRae, 80-1 11.
A peremptory mandamus does not lie to compel the county commis
sioners to receive an official bond tendered by the superior court clerk.
The court can compel them to act, but cannot control the exercise of
their discretion. Buckman v. Com'rs, 80-121.
A mandamus will not lie to compel the speakers of the two houses of
the legislature to sign an act duly passed by that body, but which,
through inadvertence, had not been signed by the speakers. Scarbo
rough v. Robinson, 81-409.
A mandamus will not issue to compel county commissioners to levy a
tax beyond the constitutional limit, but only to the end that any excess
of revenue between the amount necessary to pay the current and neces
sary county expenses and the constitutional limit of taxation shall be
applied to the satisfaction of a debt against the county. Cromartie v.
Com'rs, 87-134.
An appellant is not entitled to a mandamus to compel the judge below
to send up a correct statement of the case upon an affidavit that the case
as settled by the judge does not correctly set forth the grounds of excep
tion. His remedy is by application for a certiorari. McDaniel v. King,
89-29.
Mandamus will not lie to a judge to "settle a case" when petitioner
has, by laches, lost his right to appeal. Cross v. Cross, 90-15.
If the commissioners refuse to induct an ineligible person into office,
the courts will not compel them to do so. McNeil v. Somers, 96-467;
Worthy v. Barrett, 63-199; Hannon v. Grizzard, 96-293; S. C, 99-161.
While it is the duty of the register of deeds to permit all persons to
inspect the records committed to his custody, a mandamus will not
require him, without the payment of his fees, to allow anyone to make
copies or abstracts therefrom. Newton v. Fisher, 98-20.
The issuance of a license to sell liquor by a board of county commis
sioners is a matter discretionary, and a mandamus will not issue to com
pel them to do so, it not being alleged and shown that their refusal to
grant a license was arbitrary. Muller v. Com'rs, 89-171; Com'rs v.
Com'rs, 107-335; Jones v, Com'rs, 106-436.
The order of the board of education that plaintiff's children be
admitted into a public school furnishes no warrant for mandamus to
enforce such admission when contrary to law. McMillan v. School
Committee, 107-609.
To enforce entry of judgment. —When the superior court undertakes to
vary a judgment which has been affirmed by the supreme court man
damus, and not an appeal, is the proper remedy. Murrill v. Murrill,
90-120.
Amendment. —The court has no power, with or without amendment, to
convert an action brought to obtain an injunction into one for a man
damus. McNair v. Commissioners, 93-364.
To try the title to office. —An action in the nature of a quo warranto, and
not a mandamus, is the proper remedy when the right or title to an
office is put in issue. Brown v. Turner, 70-93; Mott v. Tate, 66-231.
Qucere, whether mandamus can be used to try the title to office, under
any circumstances. Howerton v. Tate. 66-231.
To induct into office. —One who seeks to compel induction to an office
by mandamus must show an affirmative right to the office. Worthy v.
Barrett, 63-199.
A mandamus to induct will not lie pending a contest over the title to
the office Brown v. Turner, 70-93.
A mandamus will not lie to induct one into office during the pendency
of an appeal in quo warranto between the same parlies. The judgment
of the court below in favor of the plaintiff is suspended by the appeal
and the title to the office is undeterminate. Hannon v. Commissioners,
89-123.
Note. —Section 610, ante, as now amended provides that a mandamus
shall issue to execute the judgment in quo warranto and for a super
sedeas bond if there is an appeal.
If term of office expire. — If the term of the office into which the plaintiff,
in mandamus, demands to be inducted, expires before final judgment,
the court can do nothing but dismiss the action. Colvard v. Commis
sioners, 95-515To re-instate in office. —Where one is illegally removed from office by a
municipal body and his successor elected and inducted, the party
removed cannot be reinstated by a mandamus against the corporation,
but must resort to a qno warranto. Ellison v. Raleigh, 89-125.
But if after such illegal removal no successor is elected, a mandamus
is the proper remedy to re-instale. Doyle v. Raleigh, 89-133.
Writ, how to be obeyed.—The justices of a county having failed, for
many years, to levy a tax to pay the interest on bonds issued by the
county to aid in building a railroad, the board of commissioners should
not be required at the suit of the creditors, to raise in one year, by tax
ation, the whole amount of interest in arrear. In case of a mandamus
ordering the commissioners to levy a tax and pay the interest due to
creditors, it was a prudent exercise of a discretion to raise part by taxa
tion, and issue county bonds in order to raise the remainder. Johnston
v. Commissioners, 67-101.
A mandamus issued against a county to compel the levy of a tax to
pay off its indebtedness does not warrant a levying of taxes in any other
manner or time than that presented by law for ordinary taxes. Mauney
v. Commissioners, 71-486.
Coupled with other remedies. —When a mandamus is granted to compel
a recanvass of election returns by a board of county commissioners, the
court can grant at the same time an order restraining the persons
declared elected upon the first canvass from exercising the duties of
their offices. Moore v. Jones, 76-188.
A party may in the same action sue to recover a debt due from a
county and demand a mandamus to compel its payment. McLendon
v. Commissioners, 71-38; Lutterloh v. Commissioners, 65-403; Fry v.
Commissioners, 82-504.
Cannot require county officers to appear outside of their counties. —A judge
cannot issue mandamus to county officers to appear before him at a point
outside of their counties. Moore v. Jones, 76-182.
Peremptory mandamus.-The eighth section of the ordinance of the conven
tion of one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, having provided that
when the president and chief engineer of the Northwestern North Caro
lina Railroad Company should have complied with certain terms, in
respect to the first division of the said road, the governor should direct
that the public treasurer should make a loan to the company, by issue
of a certain amount of state bonds, and the terms having been complied
with, the company was entitled to have a peremptory mandamus to com
pel the treasurer to issue the bonds, notwithstanding the subsequent leg
islation contained in the acts of 1868-'9, ch. 32, and 1869-'70, chs. 71
and 100, as all those acts, taken together, left the ordinance above men
tioned in full force and effect. Railroad v. Jenkins, 65-173.
When a debt against a municipal corporation has been reduced to
judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, a peremptory mandamus
may be properly applied for, although such judgment is dormant. Webb
v. Com'rs, 70-307.
A creditor of a county cannot be compelled, either by the legislature
or by the lx>ard of commissioners, to "bond" his debt and wait five
years for its ultimate satisfaction; such creditor is entitled to a peremp
tory mandamus. Edwards v. Com'rs, 70-571.
Where a county has means within the limit of taxation to pay a debt,
a peremptory mandamus will issue. Uzzle v. Com'rs, 70-564.
Alternative mandamus. — The proper judgment in an action against a
city or town upon a recovery upon a debt contracted for necessary
expenses, is an alternative and not a peremptory mandamus. Tucker
v. Raleigh, 75-267; Gaslight Company v. Raleigh, 75-274.
Where the plaintiff's demand may involve disputed facts, the proper
application is for an alternative mandamus. Where, however, the plain
tiff's claim is based upon a judgment, then the proper process is a
peremptory mandamus. Lutterloh v. Com'rs, 65-403.
The mandamus issued on a judgment against a county is usually an
alternative mandamus, and if good cause is not shown for failure to
obey, then a peremptory mandamus will issue. Fry v. Com'rs, 82-304.
Sufficient return. —The general rule is, that no return to a peremptory
mandamus is sufficient except that it has been obeyed; but if a statute
be enacted, after such peremptory order, forbidding obedience and mak
ing obedience impossible, such new matter will, of necessity, constitute
a sufficient return, provided the statute is constitutional and within the
law-making power. Sedberry v. Com'rs, 66-486.
Where a mandamus was issued, commanding the board of commis
sioners of a county to levy a tax sufficient to pay the plaintiff's claim
against the county, and a rule was afterwards served upon them to show
cause why they should not be attached for disobedience to the order, an
answer to the rule, that they had levied a sufficient tax, and placed the
lists in the hands of the sheriff, is responsive, and the rule ought to be
discharged. Johnson v. Com'rs, 67-101.
Revived. —Qucsre, whether a mandamus can be revived in any case.
Carso'n v. Com'rs, 64-566.
See, as to former practice, Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 902-909.
Sec. 024. Waste, how remediable. C. C. P., ,'i8.'i.
Wrongs, remediable by the old action of waste, are sub
jects of action as other wrongs; and the judgment may be
for damages, forfeiture of the estate of the party offending,
and eviction from the premises.
What constitutes a waste. —A view is only requisite when the court
thinks proper to order it. Waste may be defined to be an unnecessary
cutting down or destruction of timber, where there is already .sufficient
cleared land for the life-tenant to cultivate. As to swamps, where the
making of staves and shingles is the only use to be made of the land,
the life-tenant shall not be liable for using such timber according to the
ordinary use in that part of the country. Ballentine v. Poyner, 3-268;
Bright v. Wilson, 1-24.
Waste, in this country, is not to be defined by the rules of the English
law in all respects. Cutting timber trees for the purpose of clearing the
land is not waste here. What is waste must be left largely to the discre
tion of the jury upon the evidence. If the trees be cut, not to clear the
land, but for sale, it is waste. Ward v. Sheppard, 3-283.
It is waste to cut down timber for sale, or to make tar of lightwood on
the land. It is not waste to cut down timber to clear land for cultiva
tion, nor to cut it for the purpose of repairing buildings, fences and
plantation utensils. Perkins v. Coxe, 3-339.
It is not waste to clear land for cultivation, if necessary to the enjoy
ment of the estate, and a sufficient proportion of wood-land is left, nor
is it waste to permit cleared land to grow up in secondary growth.
Shine v. Wilcox, 21-631.
A tenant for life of land entirely wild may clear a fair proportion of it
for cultivation and sell the timber cut down for that purpose, but it is
waste in such a tenant to cut down valuable trees, not for the purpose
of clearing the land, but to sell the timber. Davis v. Gilliam, 40-308.
Where a tenant in common took some fixtures belonging to a mill
which was out of use for want of repairs, and used them temporarily in
a mill of his own, and also burnt some useless rotten timber belonging
to the mill-dam, it did not amount to destructive waste. Dodd v. Wat
son, 57-48.
Semble, that in analogy to the case of mines already opened, it is not
waste for an occupant to continue to make brick on premises used for
that purpose when the tenancy commenced! Sledge v. Blum, 63-374.
Waste is a spoiling or destroying of the estate, with respect to build
ings, wood or soil, to the lasting injury of the inheritance; but the acts
done or permitted that constitute such injury differ according to the
condition of the country. The clearing of land by life-tenant is waste
in England, but in this country it is left for the jury to say whether the
life-tenant has dealt with the land in a husbandman-like manner and
has observed the proportions of cleared and wood-land as a prudent
owner in fee would in the management of his own land. Sherrill v.
Connor, 107-630.
Action abates, when,—Formerly an action of waste abated by the death
of either the defendant or plaintiff. Browne v. Blick, 7-511.
Under the present Code, the action of waste abates, by the death of a
party, only as to vindictive damages. It can be continued as to actual
damages. Shields v. Lawrence, 72-40.
Where pending an action of ejectment brought by the husband and
wife for the wife's land the husband dies, the action survives to the
wife, including the right to damages for waste and rent current and in
arrear. King v. Little, 77-138.
Evidence. —In an action by remainderman against tenant for life for
waste, the defendant testified that he used the land as a prudent owner
of the fee would have done; and further, that at the time of the com
mission of the alleged waste he believed he was the owner of the fee:
Held, that the testimony of his belief of ownership was not collateral
merely, but went directly to support his evidence as to the manner in
which he had used the land, and therefore might be contradicted by
competent proofs. Floyd v. Thomas, 108-93.
Sec. <>2H. For and aaainst whom an action for waste lies.
R. V., c. lift, s. J. 52 Hen. HI, c. It.i. « Edw. I, c. Hi. 20.
Edw. I, st. 2. 11 Hen. VI, c. S.
In all cases of waste, an action shall lie in the superior
court at the instance of him in whom the right is, against
all persons committing the same, as well tenant for term of
life as tenant for term of years and guardian.
Who may bring the action. —No one shall have an action of waste, unless
he have the immediate estate of inheritance, and between the heir of
the reversioner and the tenant who commits waste in the life-time of
the reversioner there is no privity. Brown v. Blick, 7-5 r 1 .
In an action of waste where the plaintiff's title is set out as a devise
of a remainder in fee, when it is in fact a reversion in fee by descent, the
variance is fatal. Southerland v. Jones, 51-321.
Where the husband has possession of the wife's land, after issue born,
an action in the nature of waste is the proper remedy for an injury to
the inheritance, by cutting timber trees, and should be in the name of
the husband and wife jointly. But for an injury to the crop he would
sue alone. Williams v. Lanier, 44-30; Deans v. Jones, 51-230.
Owners of executory bequests and other contingent interests cannot
recover damages for waste already committed. Gordon v. Lowther,
75-193Who are liable for waBte. —A widow has no right to make turpentine
upon such of her dower land as was not used for that purpose in her
husband's life time. She may rightfully work trees already boxed and
box new trees in the same territory. Carr v. Carr, 20-189.
A husband is dispunishable for waste because he is not tenant for life
in his own right, but is seized with his wife in fee in her right. Davis
v. Gilliam, 40-308.
The husband of a tenant in dower is not liable for mere permissive
waste, after the death of his wife and the surrender of the premises,
but he is liable if he removes a house from the premises, even after the
death of his wife, though he may have built the house himself. Dozier
v. Gregory, 46-100.
Injunction to stay waste. —Where the reversion is divided amongseveral,
the widow in possession of land as dower has in general a discretionary
power as to getting firewood, etc., but in an extreme case tie court
would interfere to prevent her favoring the portion of any one of the
reversioners at the expense of the others. Dalton v. Dalton, 42-197.
An injunction to stay waste will he granted only if it appear from the
facts stated, and not on mere allegation of irreparable injury, that the
injury will be irreparable. If the waste complained of is the cutting
down timber and building in the ordinary course of agriculture, this
will not be stayed pending litigation for the mere insolvency of the party
in possession. Thompson v. Williams, 54-176: Bogey v. Shute, 54-180.
While persons holding a vested estate for life, coupled with a contin
gent remainder in fee, are not liable in an action of waste, they may be
restrained by injunction from despoiling the inheritance. Farrabow v.
Green, 10S-339; Gordon v. Lowther, 75-193.
Where land that has been levied upon is being wasted, and the officer
is prohibited, by military order, from making sale, the judgment cred
itor is entitled to an injunction against such waste. Webb v. Boyle,
63-271; Braswell v. Morehead, 45-26.
When the value of the homestead set apart consists largely of tim
ber, the judgment creditor is entitled to have the debtor, or anyone to
whom he has sold the timber, enjoined from cutting such trees for profit.
Jones v. Britton, 102-166.
See \ 338 (2), ante, and cases cited.
Sec. 026. Tenant for life aliening, still liable. B. C, c. 110,
8.2. 11 Hen. VI, e. 5.
Where tenant for life or years grants his estate to another,
and still continues in the possession of the lands, tenements,
or hereditaments, an action shall lie against the said tenant
for life or years.
Purchaser of estate by reversioner. —Where the reversioner purchases the
estate of the particular tenant, after waste committed, it does not per se
amount to a release of a claim for damages for such waste. Dupree v.
Dupree, 49"387Permissive waste. — A life-tenant is liable for permissive waste, under
The Code, $$624 to 630, if, through his neglect or wantonness, perma
nent injury is done to the inheritance. Sherrill v. Connor, 107-630.
Sec. 027. Action bg tenant against co-tenant. It. C, c. 110,
s. 4. 13 Edw. I, c. 22.
Where a joint-tenant or a tenant in common commits
waste, an action shall lie against him at the instance of his
co-tenant or joint-tenant.
Action against tenant in common. —An action for waste allowed one ten
ant in common against his co-tenant is confined to cases where there is
a permanent injury done to the property held in common. Smith v.
Sharpe, 44-91; Welling v. Burroughs, 43-61.
Quctre, whether an action in the nature of waste will lie for one ten
ant in common against another, even where the injury amounts to
destruction. Darden v. Cowper, 52-210.

Edw. I, st. 2.
Every heir shall have his action for waste committed on
lands, tenements or hereditaments of his own inheritance
as well in the time of his ancestor as in his own.
Sec. 629. Judgment for treble damages and place wasted.
R. C, c. 116, s. 3. 6 Edlv. I, c. 5. 20 Edu: I, st. 2.
In all cases of waste, when judgment shall be against
the defendant, the court may give judgment for thrice the
amount of the damages assessed by /the jury, and also that
the plaintiff recover the place wasted if the said damages
shall not be paid on or before a day to be named in the
judgment.
Judgment for damages only. —A judgment in an action for waste is not
erroneous if rendered for damages only, and not also for place wasted.
Bright v. Wilson, 1-24.
In an action brought by the reversioners for waste against the tenant
in dower, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff: Held, that they
are entitled to treble damages, in the discretion of the court. This sec
tion provides that the court may give judgment for treble damages and
the place wasted, and the supreme court will not make such discretionary
power obligatory. Sherrill v. Connor, 107-543.
Sec. 630. Remedies far injuries heretofore remediable by
writ of nuisance. C. C. P., s. 387.
Injuries remediable by the old writ of nuisance are sub
jects of action as other injuries; and in such action there
may be judgment for damages, or for the removal of the
nuisance, or for both.
Remedy. —When a nuisance has been established by the verdict of a
jury, the judge may, in his discretion, give the defendant a certain time
to abate it, and, if not then done, grant leave to plaintiff to renew his
motion for an injunction. Hyatt v. Myers, 71-271.
Limitation.—No length of possession can operate as a bar to an abate
ment of a nuisance on behalf of the public. State v. Holman, 104-S61.
When Examined.
Applicants for license to practice law will be examined
on Friday and Saturday of the week next preceding the
first week of each term.
2. Requirements.
Each applicant must have attained the age of twenty-one
years, and is required to have read—
The Constitution of this State and the United States;
Blackstone's Commentaries (the second book with care);
Coke, Cruise, Washburn or Williams on Real Property;
Stephen and Chitty on Pleading (first 212 pages);
Pomeroy on Civil Remedies;
Adams on Equity;
Greenleaf on Evidence (1st vol.);
Williams or Shouler on Executors;
Smith on Contracts;
Addison or Bigelow on Torts;
The Code of North Carolina, especially the Code of Civil
Procedure.
It is not intended to confine the student to the special
treatises above mentioned, other than Blackstone, but any
standard author on the same subjects may be used in their
place.
Each applicant must have read law for twelve months at
least, and shall file with the Clerk a certificate of good
moral character, signed by two members of the bar who
are practicing attorneys of this court.
!i. Deposit.
Each applicant shall deposit with the Clerk a sum of
money sufficient to pay the license fee before he shall be
examined; and if, upon his examination, he shall fail to
entitle himself to receive a license, the money shall be
returned to him.
Appeals—When Heard.
4. Docketing.
Each appeal shall be docketed for the judicial district to
which it properly belongs. Appeals in criminal actions
shall be placed at the head of the docket of each district if
received before the district is called. Appeals in both civil
and criminal cases shall be docketed, each in its own class,
in the order in which they are filed with the Clerk.
If not docketed next term, appeal dismissed. —If an appeal is not docketed
at the next ensuing term of the Supreme Court, it will be dismissed.
State v. James, 108-792.
See cases cited under $ 544, ante.
If case not settled, bnt without laches of appellant. —An appeal must be
brought to the next term of the supreme court. If for any cause the
judge fail to settle the case in time to be docketed the appellant must
docket the record without the "case" and apply for a certiorari at such
first term. It will be too late at the next term. Suiter v. Brittle, 92-53;
Pitman v. Kimberly, 92-562.
See U 545 and 550, ante.

If docketed next term but after call of district. —An appeal docketed in
the supreme court at any time during the term next after it was taken
is in time and will not lie dismissed, except as provided in Rule 17. Rol
lins v. L,ove, 97-210; Porter v. Railroad, 106-478.
Superior court may also adjudge appeal abandoned. — Where, after appeal
taken, the appellant neglects to have a transcript docketed in the
supreme court, the Superior court may, upon proper notice, adjudge
that the appeal has been abandoned, and proceed in the cause as if no
appeal had been taken. Avery v. Pritchard, 93-266.
5.

When Heard.
The transcript of the record on appeal from a judgment
rendered before the commencement of a term of this court
must be docketed at such term before the completion of the
call of the docket of the district to which it belongs and
stands for argument in its order. The transcript of the
record on appeal from a court in a county in which the
court shall be held during a term of this court may be filed
at such term or at the next succeeding term. If filed before
the perusal of the docket of the district to which it belongs,
it shall be heard in its order; otherwise, if a civil case, it
shall be continued,, unless, by consent, it is submitted upon
printed argument; but appeals in criminal actions shall
each be heard at the term to which it is docketed, unless,
for cause or by consent, it is continued.
Appeal not docketed at next term. —It is the duty of an appellant to have
the transcript of the record on appeal docketed in the supreme court at
the term thereof next after the rendition of the judgment from which
he appealed. Commissioners v. Steamship Co., 98-163.
Where a case was tried at the August term, 1889, of the superior court
and docketed in the supreme court April 14th, 1890, the case was set
tled and filed in the superior court clerk's office in time for the tran
script to have been docketed for appeal in this court before the call of
causes for that district, the appeal must be dismissed; and this, though
the appellee did not move to docket and dismiss during the week
allotted for that district. Porter v. Railroad, 106-478; Hinton v.
Pritchard, 108-412.
Where an appeal, taken at the November term, 1889, of the superior
court, was not docketed in this court until October 17th, 1890, and no
part of the record has been printed (no leave to appeal in forma pauperis
having been obtained), the appeal must be dismissed for either cause
stated. In re Berry, 107-326.
Delay caused by default in mails. —Where the transcript of a record was
deposited in the post-office in ample time to have reached the supreme
court and have been docketed before entering on the call of the calen
dar for that district, but by some delay in the mail it did not do so, the
excuse is reasonable, and the appeal will not be dismissed. Walker v.
Scott, 104-481.
From judgment in vacation. —Where, by agreement, the trial judge takes
the papers and renders judgment in vacation as of the term, the appeal
should be to term of the supreme court next after the term of the supe
rior court as of which the judgment is rendered. Norman v. Snow,
94-431.
Within ten days before beginning of term of supreme court. —There is no
requirement, as a prerequisite for perfecting appeals, that the term at
which the judgment was rendered should end ten days before the com
mencement of the term of the supreme court. The head-note in Greg
ory v. Hobbs, which so indicates, is misleading. Avery v. Pritchard,
106-344.
Salutary rule. —The rule as to the time within which an appeal must
be docketed is salutary, and will be enforced. Walker v. Scott, 102-487.
Appeals from judgments taken during the term.—The law favors prompt
ness and diligence in sending up appeals, and, when docketed before
call of the district completed, appeals stand for argument even in cases
tried below during the same term of the supreme court, though the rule
allows appeals to be taken to the next term. Avery v. Pritchard, 106-344.
Practice as to docketing appeals summarized. — 1. Cases tried before the
commencement of a term of the supreme court must be docketed at
such term before the complelion of the call of causes from the district
to which it belongs. 2. If not docketed by that time, the appellee may
docket certificate, under. Rule 17, and have appeal dismissed. 3. If
appellee does not do this, the appeal can be docketed at any time during
said term, but will be dismissed if not docketeH till after the close of
such term. 4. Appeals from judgments rendered during a term of the
supreme court are not required to be docketed at such term, but if sent
up and docketed at such term before the completion of the call of the
district, they stand regularly for trial. 5. All appeals in criminal cases
and appeals in civil cases submitted upon printed argument under Rule
10 are heard at the first term, though docketed after the call of the dis
trict to which they belong. 6. If by neglect of judge, clerk, or cause
other than neglect of appellant, the "case on appeal " cannot be dock
eted at the first term after the trial below, the appellant should docket
the rest of the transcript at such term and move for a certiorari, or he
will lose his appeal. Porter v. Railroad, 106-478.
G. Appeals in Criminal Actions.
Appeals in criminal cases, docketed before the perusal of
the criminal docket for any district, shall be heard before
the appeals in civil cases from said district. Criminal
appeals, docketed after the perusal of the district to which
they belong, shall be called immediately at the close of
argument of appeals from the twelfth district, unless for
cause otherwise ordered, and shall have priority over civil
cases placed at the end of the docket.
7. Call of Each Judicial District.
Causes from the first district will be called on Monday of
the first week of each term of the court ; from the second
district, on Monday of the second week ; from the third dis
trict, on Monday of the third week ; from the fourth district,
on Monday of the fourth week ; from the fifth district, on
Monday of the fifth week ; from the sixth district, on Mon
day of the sixth week ; Irom the seventh district, on Monday
of the seventh week ; from the eighth district, on Monday
of the eighth week ; from the ninth district, on Monday of
the ninth week ; from the tenth district, on Monday of the
tenth week ; from the eleventh district, on Monday of the
eleventh week, and from twelfth district, on Monday of
twelfth week.
8. End of Docket.
The call of causes not reached and disposed of during the
period allotted to each district, and those put to the foot of
the docket, shall begin at the close of argument of appeals
from twelfth district, and each cause in its order, tried or
continued, subject to Rule 6 ; but at the term of the court
held next preceding the end of the year, no civil cause will
be called and tried after the expiration of the twelve weeks
designated, unless by consent of parties and the assent of
the court.
9. Call of the Docket.
Each appeal shall be called in its proper order; if any
party shall not be ready, the cause, if a civil action, may
be put to the foot of the district by the consent of counsel
appearing, or for cause shown, and be again called when
reached, if the docket shall be called a second time; other
wise, the first call shall be peremptory; or at the first term
of the court in the year, it may by consent of the court be
put to the foot of the docket; if no counsel appear for
either party at the first call, it will be put to the end of the
district, unless a printed brief is filed by one of the parties,
and if none appear at the second call, it will be continued
unless the court shall otherwise direct. The appeals in
criminal actions will be called peremptorily for argument
on the first call of the docket, unless for good cause
assigned.
10. Submission on Printed Argument.
When, by consent of counsel, it is desired to submit a
case without oral argument, the court will receive printed
arguments, without regard to the number of the case on
docket, or date of docketing appeal. Such consent must
be signed by counsel of both parties and filed, and the clerk
shall make a note thereof on the docket, but the court,
notwithstanding, can direct an oral argument to be made
if it shall deem best.
11. If Orally Argued.
When the case is argued orally on the regular call of
the docket, in behalf of only one of the parties, no printed
argument for the other party will be received, unless it is
filed before the oral argument begins. No brief or argu
ment will be received after a case has been argued, or sub
mitted, except upon leave granted in open court, after
notice to opposing counsel.
12. If Brief Filed by Either Party.
When a case is reached on the regular call of the docket,
and a printed brief or argument shall be filed for either
party, the case shall stand on the same footing as if there
were an appearance by counsel.
If brief filed, no continuance except for cause.—When a printed brief is
filed, a motion by the opposite party to continue the cause will not be
granted unless expressly assented to, or for good cause shown. Dibbrell
v, Insurance Co., 109—.
13. Cases Heard Out of their Order.
In cases where the state is concerned, involving or affect
ing some matter of general public interest, the court may,
upon motion of the attorney general, assign an earlier place
in the calendar, or fix a day for the argument thereof, which
shall take precedence of other business. And the court, at
the instance of a party to a cause that directly involves the
right to a public office, or at the instance of a party arrested
in a civil action who is in jail by reason of inability to give
bond, or from refusal of the court to discharge him, may
make the like assignment in respect to it.
14. Cases Heard Together.
Two or more cases involving the same question may, by
leave of the court, be heard together, but they must be
argued as one case, the court directing, when the counsel
disagree, the course of the argument.
When Dismissed.
15. If Appeal Not Prosecuted.
Cases not prosecuted for two terms shall, when reached
in order after the second term, be dismissed at the cost of
the appellant, unless the same, for sufficient cause, shall be
continued. When so dismissed, the appellant may, at any
time thereafter, not later than during the week allotted to
the district to which it belongs at the next succeeding term,
move to have the same reinstated, on notice to the appellee
and showing sufficient cause.
Dismissed if not prosecuted. —An appeal not prosecuted for two terms of
the supreme court will be dismissed when reached in regular order,
unless good cause be shown for a continuance. Rule 15; BranUy v. Jor
dan, 92-291.
Motion to reinstate not later than next term. —Failure to prosecute an
appeal for two terms, is sufficient ground for dismissal, unless, for suffi
cient cause shown, the case shall be continued. Motion to reinstate,
upon notice, may be heard not later than the next term. Wiseman v.
Commissioners, 104-330.
If reinstated.—When a motion to dismiss an appeal, because not prose
cuted in apt time, is allowed, but subsequently the case is reinstated, a
failure to print within the time prescribed will not be deemed a sufficient
ground for a dismissal, but further time will be granted. Briggs v. Jervis,
98-454.
Superior court may adjudge appeal abandoned.—Where an appellant neg
lects to prosecute his appeal, the appellee may either move to docket
and dismiss under the rule, or he may proceed with the action in the
superior court. Avery v. Pritchard, 93-266.
Rule not merely directory. —Rules of the supreme court are not merely
directory; it is the duty of the appellant to prosecute his appeal accord
ing to the rules. Wiseman v. Com'rs, 104-330.
Hi. Motion to Dismiss.
A motion to dismiss an appeal for non-compliance with
the requirements of the statute in perfecting an appeal must
be made at or before entering upon the trial of the appeal
upon its merits, and such motion will be allowed unless
such compliance be shown in the record, or a waiver thereof
appear therein, or such compliance is dispensed with by a
writing, signed by the appellee or his counsel, to that effect,
or unless the court shall allow appropriate amendments.
When to be made. —A motion to dismiss an appeal because the appel
lant has not complied with the requirement of the statute and rules of
court in respect to the manner of perfecting an appeal, must be made
at or before entering upon the hearing of the cause. Hutchison v. Rumfelt, 82-425; Rose v. Baker, 99-323.
If docketed during next term, but after call of district. —An appeal will
not be dismissed if docketed at the proper term, but after the call of the
district to which it belongs, when the appellee failed to docket and dis
miss at the end of the call of the district (as allowed by Rule 17). Rol
lins v. Love, 97-210; Bryan v. Moring, 99-16; Barbee v. Green, 91-158;
Hughes v. Boone, 100-347.
If not docketed till after the next term. —Where the appellant fails to
docket his appeal during the term at which, under the statute and rules
of court, it should be docketed, it will be dismissed on motion, notwith
standing the appellee did not docket the certificate and dismiss the
appeal, as he might have done under Rule 17. Hinton v. Pritchard,
108-412; Porter v. Railroad, 106-478.
If not docketed before close of call of the district Where an appeal is not
docketed at the next term before the close of the call of district, the
appellee may docket a transcript, or the certificate of the clerk, as pre
scribed by Rule 17, and have the appeal dismissed. Cross v. Williams,
91-496.
See other cases cited under Rule 17.
DefectB in undertaking on appeal. —An appeal will not be dismissed
because of defects in the undertaking on appeal, unless the provisions
of ch. 121, laws of 1887, are observed by giving the twenty days' notice
required thereby. As this statutory regulation only affects the proced
ure, the legislature has power to make its terms applicable to appeals
pending at the time of its passage. Rollins v. Love, 97-210.
Burden on appellant. —It is the duty of the appellant, if the case on
appeal is not settled, to show affirmatively that the fault is not his. Sim
mons v. Andrews, 106-201.
Time allowed to show reasonable excuse. — The Rules of Practice prescribed
by the supreme court, under art. 4, J 12 of the constitution, and § 961 of
The Code, are not merely directory. Rule 5, as to the time within which
appeals must be docketed and motion by appellee to dismiss in case of
delay beyond the time, without reasonable excuse for delay, is remedial
and salutary, and will be enforced; but, on motion, time will be given to
the party delinquent to show reasonable excuse for his delay. Walker
v. Scott, 102-487.
17. -Dismissed by A ppellee.
If the appellant in a civil action shall fail to bring up
and file a transcript of the record before the call of causes
from the district from which it comes is concluded, during
the week appropriated to the district, at a term of this court
in which such transcript is required to be filed, the appellee,
on exhibiting the certificate of the clerk of the court from
which the appeal comes, showing the names of the parties
thereto, the time when the judgment and appeal were
taken, the name of the appellant, and the date of the set
tling of the case on appeal, if any has been filed, and filing
said certificate or a certified transcript of the record in this
court, may move to have the appeal docketed and dismissed
at appellant's cost, with leave to the appellant, during the
term, and after notice to the appellee, to apply for the
re-docketing of the cause; and if an appellant shall fail to
file the transcript of the record of his appeal within the
time he might do so, so that the appeal shall stand for
argument at the term to which it is taken, the appellee
may move, during the week assigned to the district, to dis
miss the same as above provided, and his motion shall be
allowed, unless reasonable excuse for such failure shall be
shown within such time as the court may direct, in which
case the court may deny the motion and allow a continu
ance.
Dismissed by appellee. —This rule is a privilege to the appellee, and the
appellant can draw no argument against the appellee from his failure to
use it. Wilson v. Seagle, 84-110.
An appeal will be dismissed on motion of appellee, where the require
ments of the statute for perfecting it are not complied with. Hutchin
son v. Rumfelt, 82-425; Sever v. McLaughlin, 82-332.
Dismissed upon certificate.—If an appeal is not docketed before the call
of that district at next term of the supreme court is concluded, the
appellee, upon exhibiting the certificate of the clerk as required by Rule
17. may docket and have the appeal dismissed. Head-note in Bryan v.
Moring, 99-16, corrected. Bailey v. Brown, 105-127; Cross v. Williams,
91-496; Rose v. Shaw, 105-126; Rollins v. Love, 97-210.
Appellee may proceed in lower court. —Where an appellant neglects to
docket his appeal, the appellee may either docket and dismiss, under
this rule, or he may proceed with the action in the superior court. Avery
v. Pritchard, 93-266.
If no case filed, appeal not dismissed, but judgment affirmed.—An appeal
will not be dismissed for absence of a statement of case on appeal. The
proper motion is to affirm the judgment. Walker v. Scott, 102-487.
See \\ 549, 550, ante, and cases cited.
Delay caused by mails.—Where the delay in docketing is caused by the
irregularity of the mail, and there is no laches on the part of the appel
lant, the appeal will not be dismissed. Walker v. Scott, 104-481.
18. When Appeal Dismissed.
When an appeal is dismissed by reason of the failure of
the appellant to bring up a transcript of the record, and the
same, or a certificate for the purpose, as allowed by Rule 17,
is procured by appellee, and the case dismissed, no order
shall be made setting aside the dismissal or allowing the
appeal to be reinstated, even though the appellant may be
otherwise entitled to such order, until the appellant shall
have paid, or offered to pay, the costs of the appellee in pro
curing the transcript of the record, or proper certificate,
and in causing the same to be docketed.
Motion to reinstate. — A motion to reinstate an appeal will not be allowed,
nor will a certiorari be granted, where it appears that the appellant
negligently lost his appeal by failing to file the necessary undertaking
within the prescribed tune. Bowen v. Fox, 99-127.
The proper way to obtain relief against a judgment dismissing an
appeal where the dismissal turned upon a question of law, is by a peti
tion to re-hear, and not by a motion to reinstate. Ibid.
Transcripts.
19. Trunscrijtt of the Record.
(/) The Record. —In every record of an action brought
to this court, the proceedings shall be set forth in the order
of time in which they occurred, and the several processes,
or orders, etc., shall be arranged to follow each other in the
order the same took place, when practicable.
Proper transcript must be sent up by appellant. —Before the court will con
sider an appeal the appellant must cause a transcript, prepared in accord
ance with the rules, to be filed and docketed. State v. Preston, 104-733.
It is the duty of the appellant to have so much of the record sent up
as may be necessary to present clearly the matters he desires to have
reviewed, and he cannot take advantage of any defect in the transcript
to set out the case intelligibly. Smith v. Fite, 98-517.
Transcript should set out only so much of the record as is necessary. —The
transcript on appeal should state only so much of the evidence as raised
a question of law at the trial, and then the charge prayed and given
thereon, with simplicity and precision. Green v. Collins, 28-139.
The attention of trial judges is called to the evils resulting from inser
tion of unnecessary matter in cases on appeal, especially when steno
graphic notes are made of the trial. Durham v. Railroad, 108-399.
Transcript must show that the court had jurisdiction. —No appeal will be
entertained unless the transcript shows that the court below had juris
diction, and that the cause was properly constituted there. Gordon v.
•Sanderson, 83-1; Broadfoot v. McKeithan, 92-561.
In order for the supreme court to acquire jurisdiction, it must appear
in the transcript of the record that an action was instituted, that pro
ceedings were had and a judgment rendered from which an appeal could
be taken, and that an appeal was taken from such judgment. Spence
v. Tapscott, 92-576.
Transcript must show before whom the case was tried. —Every transcript
must set forth before what person or persons the proceedings were had,
or by whose authority the record was made. Howell v. Ray, 83-553;
State v. Butts, 91-524, and cases there cited.
The transcript should always show that a court was held at the time
and place and by the judge prescribed by law; and it should also set
forth, with certainty, the matters in controversy upon which the appel
late court will be called upon to deliberate and determine. The irregu
lar practice of sending up by piece-meal essential portions of the record
will be no further tolerated. Bethea v. Byrd, 93-141.
If the record is a set of loose papers. —If the record is a set ofloose, dis
connected papers, not containing a full history, the case will be remanded.
State v. Jones, 82-691.
Transcript construed. —When it appears that the prayer for instructions
appeared in the wrong place in the record, and the clerk, instead of
copying it in the right place, refers to it, and this reference is immedi
ately followed by the words, "his honor declined all special instructions,
and declined to put his instructions in writing, as requested, and defend
ants excepted," and. this was followed by the charge of the court, the
supreme court will read the case as if the prayer had been written out
in full at the place of reference. Drake v. Connelly, 107-463.
When both parties appeal. —When both parties appeal, a transcript of
the record must be sent up for each. This rule cannot be waived by
consent of counsel. Perry v. Allen, 96-347; Jones v. Hoggard, 107-349;
Bank v. Bobbitt, 108-525.
Plat of survey.—A plat of a survey used on the trial may be sent up to
render the verdict more intelligible. Smith v. Fite, 98-517.
If no statement of case. —When the transcript of the record is not accom
panied by a case on appeal (where such case is required) and no error
appears in the record, the supreme court will, upon motion, or may, ex
mero motu, affirm the judgment rendered below, unless good cause is
shown for the apparent laches of the appellant. Mitchell v. Tedder,
108-266; State v. Freeman, 93-558.
See numerous cases cited under \ 550, ante.
{2) Pages Numbered. —The pages of the record shall be
numbered, and there shall be written on the margin of each
a brief statement of the subject-matter contained therein.
( j) Index. —On some paper attached to the record, there
shall be an index thereto, in the following or some equiva
lent form :
Summons—date
Page 1.
Complaint—First cause of action
" 2.
"
Second cause of action
" 3.
Affidavit for Attachment, etc
" 4.
Recommended. —The court recommend that the record on appeal be
drawn in accordance with Eaton's Forms. State v. Butts, 91-524.
20. Insufficient Transcript.
If any cause shall be brought on for argument, and the
above regulations shall not have been complied with, the
case shall be put to the foot of the district, or the foot of
the docket, or continued, as may be proper, and it shall be
referred to the clerk, or some other person, to put the record
in the prescribed shape, for which an allowance of five dol
lars will be made to him, to be paid in each case by the
appellant, and execution therefor may immediately issue.
Insufficient transcript.—Where the transcript of the record is insufficient
the appeal will, usually, not be dismissed, but the papers will be
remanded that a proper transcript may be sent up. Spence v. Tapscott,
92-576; Buie v. Simmons, 90-9; Bethea v. Byrd, 93-141; Moore v. Vanderburg, 90-10.
Ordinarily, if a defective transcript is filed the court will order a cer
tiorari, but it will refuse to do so, and will dismiss the appeal when it is
apparent that it is without merit. State v. Preston, 104-733.
'11. Marginal References.
A case will not be heard until there shall be put in the
margin of the record, as required in the next preceding
paragraph, brief references to such parts of the text as are
necessary to be considered in a decision of a case.
22. Of Unnecessary Records.
The cost of copies of unnecessary and irrelevant testi
mony, or of irrelevant matter about the appeal not needed
to explain the exceptions or errors assigned, and not con
stituting, a part of the record of the action of the court
taken during the progress of the cause, shall, in all cases,
be charged to the appellant, unless it appears that they
were sent up by the appellee, in which case the cost shall
be taxed against him.
Costs of unnecessary records. —Where much of the record is wholly
unnecessary in elucidating the point presented in the appeal, the clerk
will be directed not to tax the appellee with that part of the costs. Grant
v. Reese, 82-72.
The costs of unnecessary and irrelevant matter, accompanying a tran
script, in regard to which no exception is taken below, will be taxed
against the appellant whether he succeeds or not. Clayton v. Johnson,
82-42.4.
Where a record contains superfluous matter, the appellant will be
taxed with the costs occasioned by it, although he succeeds in the
appeal. Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, 96-7 1.
The attention of trial judges is directed to evils resulting from the
insertion of unnecessary matter in a case on appeal, especially when sten
ographic reports are made of the trial. Durham v. Railroad, 108-399.
Pleadings.
23. Memoranda of.
Memoranda of pleadings will not be received or recog
nized in the supreme court as pleadings, even by consent
of counsel, but the same will be treated as frivolous and
impertinent.
If no pleadings are sent up. — If no pleadings were filed, the case can be
amended by filing them here, or it will be remanded, and they may be
filed below. Wyatt v. Railroad, 109—; Daniel v. Rogers, 95-134; Row
land v. Mitchell, 90-649.
24. Assiguiiif/ Two or More Causes of Action.
Every pleading containing two or more causes of action
shall, in each, set out all the facts upon which it rests, and
shall not, by reference to others, incorporate in itself any
of the allegations in them except that exhibits, by marks
or numbers, may be referred to without reciting their con
tents, when attached thereto.
25. When Scandalous.
Pleadings containing scandalous or impertinent matter
will, in a plain case, be ordered by the court to be stricken
from the record, or reformed, and for this purpose the court
may refer it to the clerk-, or some member of the bar, to
examine and report the character of the same.
20. Amendments.
The court may "amend any process, pleading or pro
ceeding, either in form or substance, for the purpose of
furthering justice, on such terms as shall be deemed just,
at any time before final judgment, or may make proper
parties to any case, where the court may deem it necessary
and proper for the purpose of justice, and on such terms
as the court may prescribe. The Code, s. 965.
Amendments in what cage. —The spirit and equity of The Code, \ 274,
extend to the supreme court, and the same relief will be administered
in like cases as in the superior court. Wiley v. Logan, 94-564; Wade v.
Newbern, 73-318; Home v. Home, 75-101.
See \ 274, ante.
Substitution of parties. —Amendments will not be allowed when they
would destroy a just legal ground for the appeal, which existed when it
was taken, such as the introduction of a party plaintiff who could main
tain the action, while the party to the record when the appeal was taken
could not do so, and objection was made for that cause. Grant v. Rogers,
94-755; Wilson v. Pearson, 102-290.
While an amendment substituting parties can be allowed in the
supreme court, it will not be permitted when it will put the opposite
party to a disadvantage. Hodge v. Railroad, 108-24; Justices of Tyrrell
v. Simmons, 48-187.
See I 273, ante.
May direct amendment to be made below. —While it may be the supreme
court has power to direct or allow amendments to the record below of a
cause while an appeal is pending, it is clear that it has no such power
after a final judgment therein has been rendered. Walton v. McKesson,
101-42S.
EXCFPTIONS.
27. Itow Assigned.
Every appellant shall set out in his statement of case
served on appeal his exceptions to the pleadings, rulings
or judgment of the court, briefly and clearly stated and
number. If there be no case settled, then, within ten
days next after the end of the term at which the judgment
is rendered from which an appeal shall be taken, or in case
of a ruling of the court at chambers and not in term time,
within ten days after notice thereof, shall file the said excep
tions in the clerk's office. No other exceptions than those
so set out, or filed, and made part of the case or record,
shall be considered by this court, except exceptions to the
jurisdiction, or because the complaint does not state a cause
of action, or motions in arrest for the insufficiency of an
indictment.
Exceptions must be specific. — Errors must be specifically assigned. An
"unpointed, broadside" exception to the "charge as given " will not
be considered. McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354, and numerous previous
cases there cited.
Cited and approved since in Carlton v. Railroad, 104-365; Pollock v.
Warwick, 104-638; Whitehurst v. Pettipher, 105-40; Taylor v. Plummer,
105-56; Helms v. Green, 105-251; Taylor v. Navigation Co., 105-484;
Southerland v. Railroad, 106-100; State v. Parker, 106-71 1; Everett v.
Williamson, 107-204; Thompson v. Telegraph Co., 107-449; State v.
McDuffie, 107-885; State v. Brabham, 108-793.
Dnty of appellant. —It is the duty of the appellant to have the assign
ments of error in every case on appeal presented with such fullness of
statement as will enable the court to determine the case upon its real
merits. Sampson v. Railroad, 70-404; Boyer v. Teague, 106-571; Turner
v. Foard, 83-683; McNeill v. Chadbourne, 79-149.
The appellant must assign and show error in the rulings of the court
below or the judgment will be affirmed. McDaniel v. Pollock, 87-503.
Exceptions made for first time on appeal. —The rule of practice is that
points not raised by exceptions will not be entertained when presented
for the first time in the supreme court. McMillan v. Gambill, 106-359;
Allen v. Railroad, 106-515.
See numerous cases cited, \ 550, ante.
Judgment affirmed. —If no exceptions are stated by appellant in the
case on appeal, and there are no errors in the record proper, the judg
ment will be affirmed. Swepson v. Summey, 74-551; Simmons v.
Andrews, 106-201; Turner v. Foard, 83-683; King v. Page, 86-275; Neal
v. Mace, 89-171, and other cases cited, \ 550, ante.
No assignment of error necessary, when. —No particular assignment of
error is necessary when the appeal is from a judgment pronounced on
an agreed state of facts, under The Code, \ 571. Davenport v. Leary,
95-203.
Exceptions filed in ten days, when.—When there is no exception taken
except to the judgment, usually no case on appeal is necessary, and it
is sufficient to file the exceptions thereto in ten days after judgment, as
provided by Rule 27 of the Supreme Court. Robeson v. Hodges, 105-49.
When exceptions are filed under Rule 27, the recitals contained therein
are not conclusive, but it is open to the appellee to controvert them and
to have the judge pass upon their correctness in "settling the case on
appeal." Walker v. Scott, 106-56.
Exception to the charge. —Unlike exceptions to other matters in the trial
which are waived if not taken at the time, exception to the charge may
be first taken by appellant in making out his statement of case on appeal.
If not then taken, however, it is waived, and cannot be made for the first
time in the supreme court. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718; Smith v. Smith,
108-365.
Though it is better and fairer to both sides to give the trial judge an
opportunity to correct any slip he may have made by assigning error to
charge in a motion for a new trial at that term. McKinnon v. Morrison,
ic-4-354Want of jurisdiction, or complaint not stating facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action. —A want of jurisdiction, or failure to state a cause of
action, apparent on the record, will be taken notice of by the supreme
court, although not pointed out by a demurrer. Tucker v. Baker, 86-1;
Smaw v. Cohen, 95-85; Hank v. Bobbin, 108-525; Bryant v. Fisher, 85-71;
Jones v. Commissioners, 85-278.
In such cases, the court wilj dismiss ex mero moiu. Hagins v. Rail
road, 106-537.
Jurisdiction must appear on the face of the papers to secure a hearing
on appeal. Gordon v. Sanderson, 83-1.
Error on face of the record. —The statute (? 957 of The Code) requiring
the supreme court to render such judgment, etc., as shall appear to be
proper from inspection of the u'hole record, has reference to the essential
parts of the record, such as the pleadings, verdict and judgment, in
which, if there be error, the court will correct it, though it be not
assigned. Thornton v. Brady, 100-38; Bush v. Hall, 95-82; State v.
Watkins, 101-702; McKinnon v. Morrison, 104-354; Rogers v. Bank,
108-574.
Findings of fact. —Where, upon an appeal from an order setting aside a
judgment for excusable neglect, there were no findiugs-of fact in the
record, and it did not appesr that the appellant had requested that such
findings should be made, the supreme court will assume that the excep
tion is based upon the ground that, taking as true that view of the testi
mony most favorable to the appellee, he would not be, as a matter of
law, entitled to haw the motion allowed. Holden v. Purifoy, 10S-163.
Practice as to exceptions summarized. — 1. Exceptions to evidence and all
matters occurring on the trial, except to the charge of the court, must
be noted at the time or they are waived. 2. The charge and refusal to
give instructions are deemed excepted to, though not excepted to at the
time. 3. An omission to charge on any point, or to recapitulate any
part of the evidence, is not usually ground of exception, unless there
was a prayer for instruction asked and refused, or the omission of the
evidence was called to the attention of the court at the time. 4. All
exceptions, including those to the charge, are deemed abandoned, unless
set out by appellant in making up his case on appeal. 5. Errors upon
the face of the record proper (as distinguished from errors committed in
the progress of the trial), will be corrected without assignment of error.
Taylor v. Plummer, 105-56.
See 33.412(2), 412 (3) and 550, ante, for many cases not cited above.

Printing Records.
28. What to be Printed.
Fifteen copies of so much and such parts of the record as
may be necessary to a proper understanding of the excep
tions and grounds of error assigned, as appear in the record
in each civil action, shall be printed.
This requirement reasonable and necessary.—The supreme court is estab
lished by and derives its jurisdiction from the constitution; and in these
respects, as well as that of its methods of procedure, it is not subject to
legislative control. Constitution, art. 4, H 8 and 12. The enforcement
of Rules 28, 29 and 30, in relation to the printing of records, is neces
sary to the administration of justice. Rencher v. Anderson,, 93-105.
The rule of the supreme court requiring certain parts of the record to
be printed is not unreasonable, and upon failure to comply with it the
appeal will be dismissed, but may be reinstated upon good cause shown.
Nor is the rule unconstitutional. The constitution, art. 4, # 12, gives to
the general assembly power to regulate proceedings in all the courts
"below the supreme court," but confers on that court the exclusive
power to regulate its own procedure. Horton v. Green, 104-400.^1) S&f^u)
The necessity of the rule requiring the " case on appeal " to be printed
' has often been pointed out. Unless appellants observe this requirement,
it will save them needless expenditure to refrain from sending up appeals
which can only be dismissed at their costs. Hunt v. Railroad, 107-447.(41
Must be printed in all civil cases except panper appeals. —Where the appel
lant does not appeal in forma pauperis the rule requiring the record to
be printed will not be relaxed upon his affidavit that he is unable to
raise the money necessary to print. Rencher v. Anderson, 93-105.
Neglect of counsel. —Where appellant employed counsel to attend to
his appeal, who failed to have the record printed, and the case was dis" missed, it was inexcusable negligence on the part of the appellant, and
his appeal will not be reinstated. Griffin v. Nelson, 106-235 (overruling
Wiley v. Logan, 94-564); Bowen v. Fox, 99-127; Edwards v. Henderson,
109—.
Notk. —By the last cases it is held that having the record printed, like
procuring appeal bond, is no part of the duty of counsel, and when he
undertakes to do either, he is a mere ordinary agent in that regard, and
his neglect is the neglect of his principal, the appellant. Griffin v. Nel
son, 106-235; Edwards v. Henderson, 109— ; Finlayson v. Am. Acc. Co.,
109—.
29. How Designated.
The counsel for the appellant shall designate such parts
of the record as are required to be printed, and have the
same copied for the printer; if he shall fail to do so, the
clerk of this court shall cause the same to be done at the
appellant's cost ; and such printed matter shall consist of
the statement of the case on appeal, and of the exceptions
appearing in the record to be reviewed by the court; or, in
case of a demurrer, of such demurrer and the pleadings to
which it is entered. This will not preclude the parties in
the argument from referring to the manuscript parts of the
record whenever they may deem it needful to the argu
ment, nor from reading the record in full when necessary
to the proper understanding of the case.
Record must be sufficiently printed. —Appellants should be careful to see
that the mle is duly observed in respect to the parts of the record
required to be printed, as a mere colorable compliance will be treated as
no compliance at all, and the appeal dismissed. Witt v. Long, 93-388.
30. If not Printed.
If the record in an appeal shall not be printed, as required
by this and the next preceding paragraph, at the time it
shall be called in its order for argument, the appeal shall,
on motion of the appellee, be dismissed; but the court may,
after five days' notice at the same term, for good cause
shown, reinstate the appeal upon the docket, to be heard
at the next succeeding term like other appeals: Provided,
nevertheless, that this and the next preceding paragraph
shall not apply to appeals in criminal actions or appeals in
forma pauperis.
When record should be printed.—While it is better and more convenient
to have the record printed as soon as the case is docketed in the supreme
court—and this practice is commended by the court—yet, it is a com
pliance with the rule if the record is printed when the case is called in
its order for argument. Witt v. Long, 93-388; Walker v. Scott, 102-487.
Where a case upon appeal was settled and filed in the clerk's office on
the first day of November, 1889, and the transcript on appeal docketed
November 30th in the supreme court, the call of cases of the district
being on December 2d. a motion for dismissal, made by appellee for
failure to print, should be granted. Avery v. Pritchard, 106-344.
Further time to print allowed.—Where a motion to dismiss an appeal for
failure to prosecute is allowed, but subsequently case is reinstated, time
to print the record will be allowed. Briggs v. Jervis, 98-454.
Reinstatement allowed. —Where there was an honest misunderstanding
between counsel in regard to making up the case on appeal, and the
case had not been made up when the case was reached in the supreme
court, the record having been docketed without a case, and counsel for
the appellant supposed that there was no necessity of printing the record
until the case came up, but the appellee moved to dismiss, which was
allowed: // tvas held a proper case to reinstate and allow the record to be
printed. Rencher v. Anderson, 94-661.
Where an appeal is dismissed for failure to comply with Rule 28 of the
Rules of the Supreme Court, which requires a specified number of printed
copies of the statement of the case on appeal to be filed, a reinstatement
of the case, on motion, is not a matter of course, but will only be allowed
on good cause shown. Horton v. Green, 104-400, cited and approved;
Whitehurst v. Pettipher, 105-39.
Where it sufficiently appears by affidavits that the appellant caused to
be printed in due time the copies of the record required by rule of the
supreme court, and that, misunderstanding the instructions of his coun
sel and the clerk of the superior court, to whom he applied for informa
tion, he sent only one printed copy to the supreme court and mailed
others to counsel on both sides: Held, that, upon due notice and motion,
the cause will be reinstated. Smith v. Summerfield, 107-580.
Reinstatement denied. —Where, on a motion to reinstate an appeal dis
missed for failure to print the record, the appellant alleged that he
employed an attorney to represent him in the supreme court, that he
was not aware of the rule requiring the record to be printed, and that if
his attorney had notified him he would have had it printed, but did not
allege that he applied to his counsel to learn the requirements of prose
cuting appeals, nor that he furnished any money or took any steps to
have the record printed: Held, that no excuse is shown for his negli
gence, and the motion must be denied. Griffin v. Nelson, 106-235.
A motion to reinstate an appeal will be denied where it appeared that
the appeal was docketed on March 12th and reached in regular order on
March 13th, when it was dismissed for failure to print the record, under
the rules, though counsel for appellant, being present during the call of
the district, and not seeing the case on docket, left before the call was
concluded. The dismissal was not for failure to argue, but for failure to
print, which was not a professional duty, and the negligence was that of
the client. Stephens v. Koonce, 106-255; Edwards v. Henderson, 109—.
31. Costs of Printing.
Costs for printing the record shall be allowed to the suc
cessful party in the case, at the rate of sixty cents per page
of the size of the page in the North Carolina Reports, for
each page of one copy of the record printed, not exceeding
twenty pages, unless otherwise specially allowed by the
court, to be taxed in the bill of costs; and if the clerk of
this court shall prepare the manuscript copy of the parts of
the record to be printed in any appeal, he shall be allowed
ten cents per copy-sheet for such service, such allowance to
be taxed and paid as other fees and charges allowed to the
clerk by law.
Over twenty pages allowed, when. —The rules require that the appellant
shall print the case on appeal, and where that has been settled by the
trial judge and will exceed twenty printed pages, the court will order
that the appellant, if successful in his appeal, be allowed to tax the
costs of the extra necessary printing against the appellee. Durham v.
Railroad, 108-399.
Not allowed. —The successful party on appeal will not be allowed to
recover costs for printing record in excess of the amount prescribed by
this rule, except in extraordinary cases where the necessity for such
printing is made to appear. Roberts v. Lewald, 108-405.
32. If Record Insufficiently Printed.
If, after a case shall be called for argument, it shall be
made to appear to the court that it cannot be heard intelli
gently until additional parts of the record be printed, the
court may, on motion of appellee's counsel, continue the
cause to the end of the district to give appellant time to
print such additional portions, and dismiss the appeal if
such order be not complied with.
After argument, the court may, ex mero mo/u, if it appear
that required portions of the record have not been printed,
suspend the further consideration of the questions raised by
the appeal, and cause the clerk to notify appellant or his
counsel to furnish within a reasonable time a sufficient sum
to pay for said printing, or the appeal will be continued or
dismissed, at the discretion of the court.
Argument.
33. Oral Argument.
(1) The counsel for the appellant shall be entitled to open
and conclude the argument.
(2) The counsel for the appellant may be heard for one
hour and a half, including the opening argument and
reply.
(3) The counsel for the appellee may be heard one hour
and a half.
(4) The time occupied in reading the record before the
argument begins shall not be counted as part of the time
allowed for the argument; but this shall not embrace such
parts of the record as may be read pending the argument.
(5) The time for argument may be extended by the court
in a case requiring such extension; but application for such
extension must be made before the argument begins. The
court, however, may direct the argument of such points as
it may see fit outside of the time limited.
(6) Any number of counsel may be heard on either side
within the limit of the time above specified ; but if several
counsel shall be heard, each must confine himself to a part
or parts of the subject-matter involved in the exceptions not
discussed by his associate counsel, unless directed otherwise
by the court, so as to avoid tedious and useless repetition.
34. Printed Argument or Briefit.
When the cause is submitted on printed argument under
Rule 10, or a brief is filed, whether counsel appear or not,
such brief or argument, if of appellant, shall set forth a
brief statement of the case, embracing so much and such
parts of the record as may be necessary to understand the
case ; the several grounds of exceptions and assignments of
error relied upon by the appellant ; the authorities relied
upon classified under each assignment, and if statutes are
material, the same shall be cited by the book, chapter and
section ; but this shall not be understood to prevent the
citation of other authorities in the argument.
35. Copies of Brief to be Furnished.
Fifteen copies shall be delivered to the clerk of the court,
one of which shall be filed with the transcript of the record,
one handed to each of the justices at the time the argument
shall begin, one to the reporter, and one to the opposing
counsel, when he shall call for the same.
36. Brief of Appellee.
The appellee shall file the same number of like briefs,
except that he may omit the statement of the case, and it
shall be distributed in like manner.
37. Cost of Briefs.
The actual cost of printing his brief, not exceeding sixty
cents per page of the size of the pages in the North Carolina

RULES OF PRACTICE
Reports, and not exceeding ten pages, shall be allowed to
the successful party, to be taxed in the bill of costs.
Brief on re-argument. —When a re-argument is ordered by the court
(Rule 38), and an additional brief is printed, the cost thereof, not exceed
ing ten pages will be allowed to the successful party, under Rule 37.
Emry v. Railroad, 105-44.
38. Re-argument.
The court will, of its own motion, direct a re-argument
before deciding any case, if, in its judgment, it is desirable.
It is the duty of parties to see that their causes are fully argued
in the supreme court, and where this has not been, especially where the
record is voluminous and assignments of error indefinite, the court will
require it to be re-argued. Lenoir v. Mining Co., 104-490; Emry v. Rail
road, 105-44.
.39. Agreement of Counsel.
The court will not recognize any agreement of counsel
in any case unless the same shall appear in the record, or
in writing, filed in the cause in this court.
Verbal agreements. —The supreme court will not recognize any agree
ment of counsel, if disputed, unless it appears of record, or is reduced
to writing and filed in the cause. Adams v. Reeves, 74-106; Rouse v.
Quinn, 75-354; Walton v. Pearson, 82-464; Scroggs v. Alexander, 88-64;
Holmes v. Holmes, 88-833; Office v. Bland, 91-1; McCanless v. Reynolds,
91-244; Short v. Sparrow, 96-348; Mfg. Co. v. Simmons, 97-89.
Where there is a controversy between counsel in regard to oral agree
ments by which legal rights are waived, the supreme court will not
determine them; and in an application for certiorari, unless enough
uncontroverted facts appear, the court will not grant the writ. Graves
v. Hines, 106-323.
40. Entry of Appearance.
An attorney shall not be recognized as appearing in any
case unless he shall first sign a printed or written request
by him, in his own proper handwriting, addressed to the
clerk of the court, that he be entered as counsel of record
in the case mentioned therein, and such request shall be
attached to, and filed with, the transcript of the record in
such case ; and, upon filing such request, the clerk shall
enter the name of such attorney, or he may enter it himself,
thereby making him counsel of record for the party he may
designate therein. Such appearance of counsel shall be
deemed to be general in the case, unless a different appear
ance be indicated. Counsel of record are not permitted to
withdraw from a case, except by leave of the court.
Withdrawal of counsel.—After an attorney has been admitted by the
court to represent a party, he cannot, without the consent of the court,
be discharged before the end of the suit. Notice of motions may be
served upon the attorney. Walton v. Sugg, 61-98.
General appearance changed to special appearance. —Counsel will be per
mitted to change the entry of a general appearance into a special appear
ance when it is manifest that they so intended and the entry of general
appearance was a mere inadvertence. Suiter v. Brittle, 90-19.
Certiorari and Supersedeas.
41. When Applied For.
Generally, the writ of certiorari, as a substitute for an
appeal, must be applied for at the term of this court to
which the appeal ought to have been taken, or, if no appeal
lay, then before or to the term of this court next after the
judgment complained of was entered in the superior court.
If the writ shall be applied for after that term, sufficient
cause for the delay must be shown.
Before case gone into. —An application for a certiorari must usually be
made before the case is gone into upon the merits. McDaniel v. Pollock,
87-503When the judge certifies that there has been an inadvertent omission
of material matter, the certiorari will be granted after argument, if
before the consideration of case in conference. Boyer v. Teague,
106-571.
At first term.—When an appellant allows the next term of the supreme
court (after the trial below) to pass without either causing his appeal to
be docketed or applying for a certiorari, in lieu of an appeal, he is not
entitled to a certiorari at the next term. Pitman v. Kimberly, 92-562;
Suiter v. Brittle, 92-53.
Delay caused by opposite party. —When an appellant is prevented from
preparing and docketing his appeal within the prescribed time by the
conduct of appellee or his counsel, he is entitled to a writ of certiorari
to bring it up. Briggs v. Jervis, 98-454.
Will not be granted, when. — Certiorari will not be granted for omission
of judge to insert in the case a prayer of instruction refused by him,
when an exception on that ground was not set out by appellant in his
statement of case on appeal; State v. Black, 109—; though it would have
issued if such exception had been stated by appellant in his statement
of case. Lowe v. Elliott, 107-718.
Certiorari will not lie to compel the judge to send up an appeal which
was premature and improvidently attempted to be taken. Guilford v.
Georgia Co., 109—.
A certiorari will not issue to bring up a perfect transcript, when it
appears from the case on appeal that the questions intended to be raised
are without merit. State v. Johnston, 93-559; State v. McDowell, 93-541.
Laches. —When it appears that the appellant has been guilty of laches,
and there is no affidavit to negative it, the application for certiorari to
the judge to settle the case will be denied. Peebles v. Braswell, 107-68.
Ignorance.—Ignorance of the legal requirements in executing and filing
the undertaking upon appeal will not entitle an appellant to a writ of
certiorari in lieu of an appeal. Turner v. Powell, 93-341.
See \ 545, ante, and numerous cases cited.
42. How Applied For.
The writs of certiorari and supersedeas shall be granted
only upon petition specifying the grounds of application
therefor, except when a diminution of the record shall be
suggested, and it appears upon the face of the record that it
is manifestly defective, in which case the writ of certiorari
may be allowed, upon motion in writing. In all other cases,
the adverse party may answer the petition. The petition
and answer must be verified, and the application shall be
heard upon the petition, answer, affidavit and such other
evidence as may be pertinent.
Certiorari to correct statement of case. —In a petition for a certiorari to
correct a mistake in a "case settled " it must be shown that by inad
vertence, mistake or accidental misapprehension the presiding judge
misstated or failed to state something and that he would probably make
the correction if the certiorari is granted. Ware v. Nisbet, 92-202;
Currie v. Clark, 90-17; Cheek v. Watson, 90-302; Mayo v. Leggett, 96237; State v. Sloan, 97-499.
A certiorari to correct the case on appeal will not be granted when it
appears that the particulars in which the petitioner asks to have it
changed are not material to the proper hearing of the case. Porter v.
Railroad, 97-63.
A certiorari will not issue to have the "case settled " corrected unless
the petitioner sets out his grounds for believing that the judge would
make the correction if given an opportunity. Ibid.
While the court will allow a " case " to be withdrawn to be amended
by the judge when he expresses a willingness to correct an error or
inadvertence, this will not be done when the judge states that there is
no error, and that he will "make no change whatever in the case as
settled." Walker v. Scott, 106-56.
Certiorari granted. —Where it appears, from the undenied facts, that
there was a reasonable misapprehension on the part of appellant, a
certiorari will be granted. Graves v. Hines, 106-323.
Not granted. — Certiorari will not be granted where the appellant failed
to perfect his appeal by reason of an agreement that lapse of time
should not deprive him of the appeal if a compromise was not effected,
and it is alleged by the respondent and not denied by the petitioner that
a compromise was made. The writ is allowed when the petitioner has
been misled by the opposite party if the petitioner has been guilty of
no laches. Williamson v. Boykin, 99-238.
See Rule 42, supra, and numerous cases cited under § 545, ante.
43. Notice of.
No such petition or motion in the application shall be
heard unless the petitioner shall have given the adverse
party ten days' notice, in writing, of the same; but the
court may, for just cause shown, shorten the time of such
notice.
Additional Issues.
. 44. If Other 1ssues Necessary.
If, pending the consideration of an appeal, the supreme
court shall consider the trial of one or more issues of fact
necessary to a proper decision of the case upon its merits,
such issues shall be made up under the direction of the
court and certified to the superior court for trial, and the
case will be retained for that purpose.
Motions.
45. 1n Writing.
All motions made to the court shall be reduced to
writing, and shall contain a brief statement of the facts on
which they are founded, and the purpose of the same.
Such motion, not leading to debate, nor followed by vol
uminous evidence, may be made at the opening of the
sessions of the court.
Must be in writing. —The supreme court will not entertain any motion
unless reduced to writing. McCoy v. Lassiter, 94-131.
Abatement and Revivor.
40. Death of Party.
Whenever, pending an appeal to this court, either party
shall die, the proper representatives in the personalty or
realty of the deceased party, according to the nature of the
case, may voluntarily come in, and, on motion, be admitted
to become parties to the action, and thereupon the appeal
shall be heard and determined as in other cases, and, if such
representatives shall not so voluntarily become parties, then
the opposing party may suggest the death upon the record,
and thereupon, on motion, obtain an order that, unless such
representatives shall become parties within the first five
days of the ensuing term, the party moving for such order
shall be entitled to have the appeal dismissed ; or, if the
party moving shall be the appellant, he shall be entitled to
have the appeal heard and determined, according to the
course of the court: Provided, such order shall be served
upon the opposing party.
47. When Appeal Abates.
When the death of a party is suggested, and the proper
representatives of the deceased fail to appear by the fifth
day of the term next succeeding such suggestion, and no
action shall be taken by the opposing party within that time
to compel their appearance, the appeal shall abate, unless
otherwise ordered.
Opinions.
48. When Certified Down.
"The clerk shall, on the first Monday in each month,
transmit, by some safe hand, or by mail, to the clerks of
the superior courts, certificates of the decisions of the
supreme court, which shall have been on file ten days, in
cases sent from said court." (Act 1889, ch. 41.)
Certified iustauter. —The court, in its judgment, may direct an opinion
certified down in advance of the statutory time. State v. Herndon,
IG7-934Inadvertent order corrected on motion. —Where this court inadvertently
appended to its opinion the words, " and a new trial must be had in the
court below, and we so adjudge," and, at the next term, upon its atten
tion to this being called, correction was made without formal notice to
the appellee: Held, he was not entitled, as a matter of right, to such
notice, and especially when his counsel knew that a motion to correct
the record on this point would be made, and the opinion itself gave him
notice that the appended words were inadvertently added, and not con
sistent therewith. Sunimerlin v. Cowles, 107-459.
Except upon application to re-hear, or because of "mistake, inadver
tence, surprise or excusable neglect," the court has no power to amend
a regular judgment of a previous term, but where the court manifestly
intended to reverse a judgment, and inadvertently entered "affirmed"
at the foot of the opinion, the court will correct the record. Cook v.
Moore, 100-294. And where this is manifest, the court below should fol
low the decision of this court, and not the inadvertent entry at the foot
of the opinion. Scroggs v. Stevenson, 108-260.
The Judgment Docket.
40. How Kept.
The judgment docket of this court shall contain an
alphabetical index of the names of the parties in favor of
whom and against whom each judgment was entered. On
this docket the clerk of the court will enter a brief memo
randum of every final judgment affecting the right to real
property, and of every judgment requiring, in whole or in
part, the payment of money, stating the names of the par
ties, the term at which such judgment was entered, its
number on the docket of the court; and, when it shall
appear from the return on an execution, or from an order
for an entry of satisfaction by this court, that the judgment
has been satisfied, in whole or in part, the clerk, at the
request of anyone interested in such entry, and on payment
of the lawful fee, shall make a memorandum of such satis
faction, whether in whole or in part, and refer briefly to the
evidence of it.
Executions.
SO. Teste of Execution.
When an appeal shall be taken after the commencement
of a term of this court, the judgment and teste of the exe
cution shall have effect from the time of the filing of the
appeal.
Former role. —An execution issuing from the supreme court upon a
judgment of that court to a county in which the defendant has land, is a
lien upon the land from its teste. ' Rhyne v. McKee, 73-259.
See $ 436, ante.
51. Issuing and Return of.
Executions issuing from this court may be directed to
the proper officers of any county in the state. At the
request of a party in whose favor execution is to be issued,
it may be made returnable on any specified day after the
commencement of the term of this court next ensuing its
teste. In the absence of such request, the clerk shall,
within thirty days after the certificate of opinion is sent
down, issue such execution to the county from which the
cause came, making it returnable on the first day of the
next ensuing term. The execution may, when the party
in whose favor judgment is rendered shall so direct, be
made returnable to the term of the superior court of said
county held next after the date of its issue, and thereafter
successive executions will only be issued from said superior
court, and, when satisfied, the fact shall be certified to this
court, to the end that an entry to this effect be made here.
Petition to Rehear.
52. When Filed.
A petition to rehear may be filed at the same term, or
during the vacation succeeding the term of the court at
which the judgment was rendered, or within twenty days
after the commencement of the succeeding term, and, upon
filing of such petition, the chief justice, or either of the
associate justices, may, upon such terms as he sees fit, make
an order restraining the issuing of an execution, or the col
lection or payment of the same, until the next term of said
court, or until the petition to rehear shall have been deter
mined.
Will not be granted after the time allowed has expired.—An application to
rehear will not be granted after the time limited therefor. Young v.
Greenlee, S5-593; Strickland v. Draughan, 91-103.
Time, how counted. —In computing the twenty days after commence
ment of the term in which petitions to rehear may be filed, the first day
of the term is to be excluded from the count, also the last day, when it
falls on Sunday. Barcroft v. Roberts, 92-249.
Rule modified to allow petitions daring same term. —Sections 966 and 968
of The Code, are in pari materia, and must be construed together. As
\ 968 has been amended by ch. 41, laws 1887, so as to require the deci
sions of the supreme court to be certified to the lower courts during the
term, thus placing them beyond the control of the supreme court in
term time, the reason for requiring petitions to rehear to be filed only
in vacation (as is done by \ 966) has ceased, and such petitions may now
be filed also during the term at which the opinion is filed. In amending
3 968,'the legislature also amended \ 966. The rule of the supreme court
regulating petitions to rehear has been accordingly modified. Emry v.
Railroad, 102-234.
53. What to Contain. (Amended Feb.and Nov. terms, '91, as follows:)
The petition must assign the alleged error of law com
plained of; or the matter overlooked ; or the newly discovered
evidence; and that the judgment complained of has been
performed or secured. Such petition shall be accompanied
with the certificate of at least two members of the bar, who
have no interest in the subject-matter, and have never been
of counsel for either party to the suit, that they have care
fully examined the case and the law bearing upon the
same, and the authorities cited in the opinion, and that in
their opinion the decision is erroneous, and in what respect
it is erroneous. The petition shall be sent to the clerk of
this court, who shall endorse thereon the time when it was
received, and deliver the same to the justice designated by
the petitioner, who must be one of the justices who con
curred in the opinion of the court; but the petition shall
not be filed until he, or one of his associate justices, shall
endorse thereon that the case is a proper one to be reheard ;
and notice of the action had shall be given to the peti
tioner by the clerk of this court.
The rehearing may be granted as to the whole case, or
restricted to specified points, as may be directed by the
justice who grants the application.
Former judgment will be reversed, when. —The court, upon a petition to
rehear, will modify a judgment entered up at a previous term, when it
appears that on account of the careless manner in which the case was
made up, but one of two defences relied on by the defendant was con
sidered, and that on account thereof substantial justice was not
administered. Williams v. Williams, 71-216.
A former judgment will be reversed, on a petition to rehear, when it
clearly appears that the former decision resulted from the court over
looking material admissions in the pleadings of the prevailing party.
Mason v. Pelletier, 80-66.
Where an appeal was dismissed because the undertaking had not
been justified, the court allows a rehearing upon the ground that the
statutory requirement had been understood by the profession as being
merely mandatory, but gives notice that such indulgence will not be
again granted. Mauney v. Gidney, 86-717.
When the court, in its application of the law to the facts of a case,
omits to consider material facts, and the interests of parties are thereby
affected, a petition to rehear will be granted, and, in so far, the former
opinion will be modified and judgment reformed. Gay v. Grant, 105-478.
On the former hearing, the supreme court overlooked the defendants'
exception that the referee did not charge the plaintiff mortgagee in
possession with rents and profits up to February term, 1889, the date of
trial: Held, That the defendant is entitled to the rents and profits as
claimed, but, as the facts are in some doubt, a further account should
be taken and the judgment corrected so as to conform to the facts.
Morisey v. Swinson, 106-221.
Judgment will not be reversed on a rehearing, when. —No case should be
reversed upon a petition to rehear, unless it was decided hastily and
some material point was overlooked, or some direct authority was not
called to the attention of the court. Watson v. Dodd, 72-240; Hicks v.
Skinner, 72-1; Haywood v. Daves, 81-S; Devereux v. Devereux, 81-12;
Smith v. Lyon, 82-1; Lockhart v. Bell, 90-499; University v. Harrison,
93-84; Dupree v. Insurance Co., 93-237.
It is not sufficient to authorize a rehearing that the defendant, in the
opinion and judgment of the court, was assumed to be a citizen of North
Carolina, whereas, in fact, he was a citizen and resident of the state of
Virginia, when his place of residence is immaterial and without bearing
upon the point decided. Blackwell v. Wright, 74-733.
A former decision will not be reversed on a rehearing, because, in con
sidering the case, the court laid stress upon a fact that was immaterial,
when it appears that it did rely upon another fact that was material, and
came to a correct conclusion of law. Harp v. Richardson, 81-5.
The weightiest considerations induce the court to adhere to its decisions,
unless manifest error appears, especially when the decision was made
by a full court and with unanimity, and after full argument by counsel.
Lewis v. Rountree 81-20.
Where the grounds of error assigned in a petition to rehear are sub
stantially the same as those argued and passed upon in the former hear
ing, the court will not disturb its judgment, nor in such case will an order
restraining the collection of an execution upon the judgment be granted.
Ruffin v. Harrison, 91-76. Nor will a rehearing be granted upon sum
mary motion to modify final judgment. Ibid., 91-398.
The court will not grant a petition to rehear, re-examine the same
authorities and the same course of reasoning, in order to reverse the
judgment. Dupree v. Insurance Co., 93-237.
A petition to rehear will not be entertained unless it appears that some
material point was overlooked, or some controlling authority escaped
the attention of the court, or some other weighty consideration requires
it. Harrison v. Grizzard, 99-161; Fisher v. Mining Co., 97-95.
A rehearing will not be granted for any error or mistake of fact, nor
for any error of law not assigned in the case on appeal. Weathersbee v.
Farrar, 98-255.
The weightiest considerations make it the duty of the court to adhere
to its decisions. No case ought to be reversed upon petition to rehear,
unless it was decided hastily and some material point was overlooked,
or some direct authority was not called to the attention of the court. It
is not sufficient merely that two members of the bar, who, perhaps, have
not heard the argument, and may not have given the same careful con
sideration to the question decided as was given by the court, are of
opinion, and so certify, that the court has committed an error. Fry v.
Currie, 103-203.
The court reiterates that it will rehear a case only for weighty consid
erations, and when the alleged error clearly appears. Emry v. Rail
road, 105-45.
Where, on examination, the court can find no error in the respect
complained of, the petition will be dismissed. Worthy v. Brady, 108-440.
Grounds. —A petition to rehear should point out the ruling which is
alleged to be erroneous, but should not, by a course of reasoning, under
take to show that it is erroneous. The argument should be made at the
hearing, and not in the petition to rehear. White v. Jones, 92-388.
In petitions to rehear, the petitioner will not be allowed to assign
other grounds for an alleged error than those presented! at the first hear
ing. McDonald v. Carson, 95-377.
Rehearing, proper remedy. —It seems that the proper way to obtain relief
against a judgment of the supreme court dismissing an appeal, where
the dismissal turned upon a question of law, is by a petition to rehear,
and not a motion to reinstate. Boweu v. Fox, 99-127.
Not proper remedy. —A defendant by a motion to rehear a former judg
ment of the supreme court, cannot call on the court to specifically per
form a contract of compromise, alleged to have been made between the
parties in the superior court. Neal v. Cowles, 71-266.
Applications for a rehearing are based only upon alleged errors in law
and newly discovered evidence, and, therefore, such proceeding is not
the proper mode of asserting a claim to uncollected assets not included
in the former account of the party to be charged. Wilson v. Lineberger,
90-180.
Petitions to rehear are confined to alleged errors in law, or to newly
discovered evidence. Barcroft v. Roberts, 92-250.
After the expiration of the time within which there may be a rehear
ing or a motion to set aside a judgment for excusable neglect, a final
adjudication in matters formerly cognizable in equity, in the supreme
court, can only be reviewed by a new action, in the nature of a bill of
review, impeaching the judgment for fraud, or other sufficient cause,
instituted in the superior court. Farrar v. Staton, 101-78.
Rehearing for newly discovered evidence.—Rehearings for newly discov
ered evidence will only be allowed in the supreme court in cases of neces
sity, and to prevent manifest injustice. It is aii inconvenient practice,
and not to be encouraged. Shehan v. Malone, 72-59, cited and approved;
Dupree v. Ins. Co., 93-237.
See, also, Bledsoe v. Nixon, 69-81; Holmes v. Godwin, 69-467; Mat
thews v. Joyce, 85-258; Carson v. Bellinger, 90-226; Simmons v. Mann,
92-12; Davenport v. McKee, 98-500, aud other cases cited, \ 550, ante.
A rehearing for newly discovered evidence will not be allowed by the
supreme court in a criminal case. State v. Starnes, 94-973; State v.
Gooch, 94-9S7; State v. Rowe, 98-629. _
Requirements must be observed. — Petition to rehear must be filed accord
ing to the requirements of this rule and \ 966 of The Code. This case
falls within their provisions, and the defendant not having complied
with the same, the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the appeal is allowed.
Strickland v. Draughan, 91-103.
Waiver. —Where the objections urged on a petition to rehear were not
raised on the trial below, nor made in the case stated on appeal, and not
argued upon the first hearing, it is considered that every objection for
want of proper parties had been waived or abandoned, and that the case
was tried on its merits. — Etheridge v. Vernoy, 71-184.
Rehearing cannot be granted on the gronnd of frand,—Upon a petition to
rehear, the supreme court will not disturb the judgment upon the ground
of fraud; an independent action to that end should be brought in the
superior court. Grant v. Edwards, S8-246; Kincaid v. Conly, 62-270;
Kincaid v. Conly, 64-387.
54. Notice of.
Before applying for an order to restrain the issuing
of an execution, or the collection and payment of the
same, written notice must be given the adverse party of
the intended motion, as prescribed by law, and also of the
proposed application for a rehearing of the cause, with a
copy of the petition therefor. The court may, however,
grant a temporary restraining order without notice.
Order not granted. —The restraining order will not be granted unless it
appears that the court will probably reverse its former ruling. Ruffin
v. Harrison, 91-76.
Clerk and Commissioners.
55. Report of Funds in Hands of.
The clerk and every commissioner of this court, who, by
virtue or color of any order, judgment or decree of the
supreme court in any action or matter pending therein, has

action or matter, or of any other person, shall, at the term
of said court held next after the first day of January in
each year, report to the court a statement of said fund,
setting forth the title and number of the action or matter,

shall state the condition of the fund, and any change made
in the amount or character of the investment, and every
payment made to any person entitled thereto.
56. Report Recorded.
The reports required by the preceding paragraph shall
be examined by the court, or some member thereof, and
with their or his approval endorsed, shall be recorded
in a well-bound book kept for the purpose in the office of
the clerk of the supreme court, entitled " Record of Funds,"
and the cost of recording the same shall be allowed by the
court and paid out of the fund. The report shall be filed
among the papers of the action or matter to which the fund
belongs.
Books.
57. Books Taken Out.
A book belonging to the supreme court library shall not
be taken therefrom except into the supreme court chamber,
unless by the justices of the court, the governor, the attor
ney general, or the head of some department of the execu
tive branch of the state government, without the special
permission of the marshal of the court, and then only upon
the application in writing of a judge of a superior court
holding court or hearing some matter in the city of Raleigh,
the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of
representatives, or the chairman of the several committees
of the general assembly ; and in such case the marshal
shall enter in a book kept for the purpose, the name of the
officer requiring the same, the name and number of the
volume taken, when taken, and when returned.
Clerk.
58. Minute Boole.
In addition to the records now kept by the clerk, he shall
keep a "Permanent Minute Book" containing a brief
summary of the proceedings of this court in each appeal
disposed of.
Librarian.
59. Reports by Him.
The librarian shall keep a correct "Catalogue" cf all
books, periodicals and pamphlets in the library of the
supreme court, and report to the court, on the first day of
the spring term of each year, what books have been added
during the year next preceding his report, to the library,
by purchase or otherwise.
The supreme court has power to prescribe rules of practice for sub
ordinate courts. Barnes v. Easton, 98-116; Cheek v. Watson, 90-302.

Rules.
1. Entries on Records.
No entry shall be made on the records of the superior
courts (the summons docket excepted) by any other person
than the clerk, his regular deputy, or some person so
directed by the presiding judge, or the judge himself.
Minute docket. —The minute docket is intended to and should contain
a record of all the proceedings of the court, and such other entries as
the judge may direct to be therein made. Walton v. McKesson, 101-428.
Civil issue docket. —The purpose of the civil issue docket is to have
there stated the issues joined between the parties to an action, and only
such, notes and memoranda as are pertinent to such issues, and their pre
paration for trial should lie entered thereon. Walton v. McKesson,
101-428.
' If there is a conflict. —While in the absence of entries on the minute
docket those made on the civil issue docket should not be disregarded,
yet, where there is a conflict between them, nothing else appearing,
those on the former must prevail. Walton v. McKesson, 101-428.
2. Surety on Prosecution Bond anil Bail.
No person who is bail in any action or proceeding, either
civil or criminal, or who is security for the prosecution of
any suit, or upon appeal from a justice of the peace, or is
security in any undertaking to be affected by the result of
the trial of the action, shall appear as counsel or attorney
in the same cause. And it shall be the duty of the clerks
of the several superior courts to state, in the docket for the
court, the names of the bail, if any, and security for the
prosecution in each case, or upon appeal from a justice of
the peace.
3. Opening and Conclusion.
In all cases, civil and criminal, when no evidence is intro
duced by the defendant, the right of reply and conclusion
shall belong to his counsel.
The right to open and conclude is now governed by Rules of Superior
Court (Rule 3) and the decision of the judge is not appealable. Brooks
v. Brooks, 90-142; Cheek v. Watson, 90-302.
See cases cited under g 393 and 397 ante.
4. Examination of Witnesses.
When several counsel are employed on the same side,
the examination, or cross-examination, of each witness
shall be conducted by one counsel; but the counsel may
change with each successive witness, or with leave of the
court, in a prolonged examination of a single witness.
When a witness is sworn and offered, or when testimony
is proposed to be elicited, to which objection is made by
counsel of the opposing party, the counsel so offering shall
state for what purpose the witness, or the evidence to be
elicited, is offered; whereupon the counsel objecting shall
state his objections and be heard in support thereof, and
the counsel so offering shall be heard in support of the
competency of the witness and of the proposed evidence in
conclusion, and the argument shall proceed no further unless
by special leave of the court.
Re-opening evidence. The court in its discretion after the close of testi
mony may allow the case to be re-opened and further evidence introduced.
Olive v. Olive, 95-485; Pain v. Pain, 80-322; State v. Lee, 80-483; State
v. King, 84-737; Dupree v. Insurance Company, 93-237.
5. Motion for Continuance.
When a party in a civil suit moves for a continuance on
account of absent testimony, such party shall state, in a
written affidavit, the nature of such testimony and what
he expects to prove by it, and the motion shall be decided
without debate, unless permitted by the court.
( The above rules substantially prescribed by the Supreme
Court at January term, /S/j.)
0. Decision of Right to Conclude not Appealable.
In any case where a question shall arise as to whether
the counsel for the plaintiff or the counsel for the defendant
shall have the reply and the conclusion of the argument,
except in the case mentioned in Rule 3, the court shall
decide who is so entitled, and its decision shall be final and
not reviewable.
Not reviewable. —Rule 6, regulating the practice in the superior court
commits the order of argument (and this embraces the matter of intro
ducing evidence) to the discretion of the presiding judge whose decision
is not reviewable. Austin v. Secrest, 91-214.
After the jury was empanneled, in a trial for murder, prisoner's counsel
offered to admit that prisoner killed the deceased with a deadly weapon,
averring that the killing was accidental, and therenpon claimed the
right to open and conclude the testimony and argument; the court
declined to permit the admission and directed the state to proceed with
the proof: Held, That this decision was not reviewable. State v.
Keene, 100-509.
The right to open and conclude the argument, except in cases where
no evidence has been introduced by the defendant, is now, under Rule
6. Superior Court, left to the discretion of the court, and the exercise of
this discretion will not be reviewed upon appeal. State v. Anderson,
101-758; Cheek v. Watson, 90-302.
7. 1ssues.
Issues shall be made up as provided and directed in The
Code, §§ 395 and 396.
Issues raised by the pleadings.—Only such issues as are raised by the
pleadings should be submitted to the jury. Wright v. Cain, 93-296.
The court should not submit an issue not raised by the pleadings, nor
instruct the jury upon a view not presented by the testimony. Carpen
ter v. Tucker, 98-316; Humphreys v. Trustees, 109—.
The material issues raised by the pleadings must be submitted, unless
the right of the party to it is waived in some mode. Davidson v.
Gifford, 100-18.
Issues submitted without objection. —If a party assent to the submission
of an improper issue, he will not be permitted to make it the ground of
an exception. Carey v. Carey, 108-267.
Issues not asked for. —If a party desires an issue submitted, he should
tender it before the trial begins. It is too late for him to object after
verdict that such issue was not submitted. Silver Valley Co. v. Balti
more Smelting Co., 99-445.
•Immaterial issue. —The submission to the jury of an immaterial issue,
when it cannot be seen how it prejudiced the appellant, is not assignable
as error. McDonald v. Carson, 94-497; Perry v. Jackson, 88-103.
Rule for framing issues. —While the issues must arise on the pleadings,
the judge may, in his discretion, submit as many as he thinks proper,
subject only to the restriction that sufficient facts shall be found to
enable the court to proceed to judgment, and that neither party shall
be denied the opportunity to present any view of the law arising on the
evidence through prayers for instruction. Humphreys v. Trustees, 109—,
citing McAdoo v.. Railroad, 105-140; Denmark v. Railroad, 107-187;
Leach v. Linde, 108-547.
See cases cited under \\ 395 and 396, ante.

Judgments shall be docketed as provided and directed in
The Code, §433.
See cases cited under \ 433, ante.

another county, until after the expiration of the term of
the court at which such judgments were rendered.
Teste. —All judgments taken during any term relate to the first day of
the term, even though the judge fails to open court upon the first day.
Norwood v. Thorp, 64-682; and this independent of C C P. Farley v.
Lea, 20-169.
See \ 435, and cases there cited.
10. Docketing Magistrates' Judgments.
Judgments rendered by a justice of the peace upon a
summons issued and returnable on the same day as the
cases are successively reached and passed on, without contin
uance as to any, shall stand upon the same footing, and
transcripts for docketing in the superior court shall be fur
nished to applicants at the same time after such rendition
of judgment, and, if delivered to the clerk of such court on
the same day, shall create liens on real estate, and have no
priority or precedence the one over the other, if all are, or
shall be, entered within ten days after such delivery to
said clerk.
Suggested in Johnson v. Sedberry, 65-1.
11. Transcript on Appeal to Supreme Court.
In every case of appeal to the supreme court, or in which
a case is taken to the supreme court by means of the writ
of certiorari as a substitute for an appeal, it shall be the
duty of the clerk of the superior court, in preparing the
transcript of the record for the supreme court, to set forth
the proceedings in the action in the order of time in which
they occurred, and the several processes, or orders, and
they shall be arranged to follow each other in order as
nearly as practicable.
The pages of the transcript shall be plainly numbered,
and there shall be written on the margin of each a brief
statement of the subject-matter, opposite to the same.
On some paper attached to the transcript of the record,
there shall be an index to the record in the following, or
some equivalent form.

12. Transcript on Appeal— When Sent Up.
Transcripts on appeal to the supreme court shall be
forwarded to that court in twenty days after the case
agreed, or case settled by the judge, is filed in office of
clerk of the superior court. The Code, s. jj1.
Mandatory. —This rule should be strictly observed and the transcript
sent up within twenty days after the "case" is filed in the clerk's
office. Walker v. Scott, 104-481.
Appellant must prepay costs, if demanded. —It is the duty of the appellant
to pay the costs of the transcript. Andrews v. Whisnant, 83-446; Bailey
v. Brown, 105-127. Leave to appeal in forma pauperis does not relieve
appellant of paying costs of transcript. Bailey v. Brown, 105-127. In
criminal cases, appellant need not prepay costs of transcript. State v.
Nash, 109—.
Duty of appellant and not of counsel. —It is duty of appellant to have
transcript sent up aud if not sent up it is his neglect. Griffin v. Nelson,
106-235.
Costs. —The costs of preparing and transmitting the transcript of a
record on appeal to the supreme court are not costs in the supreme
court, but in the court below, where the necessary orders and judgments
for their payment and recovery should be entered. Roberts v. Lewald,
108-405.
Appeal adjudged abandoned by superior court. —Where after appeal taken
the appellant neglects to have the transcript docketed in the supreme
court, the superior court may, on notice, adjudge that the appeal has
been abandoned and proceed as if no appeal had been taken. Avery v.
Pritchard, 93-266.
See Code \ 551, and cases cited.
1.3. Reports of Clerks and Commissioners.
Every clerk of superior court, and every commissioner
appointed by such court, who, by virtue or color of any order,
judgment or decree of the court in any action or proceed
ings pending in it, has received or shall receive, any money
or security for money, to be kept or invested for the benefit
of any party to such action, or of any other person, shall,
at the term of such court held on or next after the first
day of January in each year, report to the judge a state
ment of said fund, setting forth the title and number of
the action and the term of court at which the order, or
orders, under which the officer professes to act, were made,
the amount and character of the investment, and the
security for the same, and his opinion as to the sufficiency
of the security. In every report, after the first, he shall
set forth any change made in the amount or character of
the investment since the last report, and every payment
made to any person entitled thereto.
The reports required by the next preceding paragraph
shall be made to the judge of the superior court holding
the first term of the court in each and every year, who shall
examine, or cause the same to be examined, and, if found
correct, and so certified by him, shall be entered by the
clerk upon his book of accounts of guardians and other
fiduciaries.
14. Recordari.
The supreme court shall grant the writ of recordari only
upon the petition of the party applying for it, specifying par
ticularly the grounds of the application for the same. The
petition shall be verified and the writ may be granted with
or without notice; if with notice, the petition shall be
heard upon answer thereto duly verified and upon affidavits
and other evidence offered by the parties; and the decision
thereupon shall be final, subject to appeal as in other cases;
if granted without notice, the petitioner shall first give the
undertaking for costs, and for the writ of supersedeas, if
prayed for as required by The Code, § 545. In such case,
the writ shall be made returnable to the term of the superior
court of the county in which the judgment or proceeding
complained of was granted or had, and ten days' notice in
writing of the filing of the petition shall be given to the
adverse party before the term of the court to which the
writ shall be made returnable. The -defendant in the
petition, at the term of the superior court to which the
said writ is returnable, may move to dismiss, or answer
the same and the answer shall be verified. The court
shall hear the application at the return term thereof—unless
for good cause shown the hearing shall be continued—upon
the petition, answer, affidavits and such evidence as the
court may deem pertinent, and dismiss the same, or order
the case to be placed on the trial docket according to law.
In proper cases the court may grant the writ of certiorari
in like manner, except that in case of the suggestion of a
diminution of the record it shall manifestly appear that
the record is imperfect, the court may grant the writ upon
motion in the cause.
See, 11 545 and 564, ante, and cases cited.
15. Judgment— When to Require Bonds to be Filed.
In no case shall the court make or sign any order, decree,
or judgment directing the payment of any money or secur
ities for money belonging to an infant or to any person,
until it shall first appear that .such person is entitled to
receive the same and has given the bonds required by law
in that respect, and such payment shall be directed, only
when such bonds as required by law shall have been given
and accepted by competent authority.
16. Next Friend—How Appointed.
In all cases where it is proposed that infants shall sue by
their next friend, the court shall appoint such next friend
upon the written application of a reputable disinterested
person closely connected with such infant; but if such
person will not apply, then upon the like application of
some reputable citizen, and the court shall make such
appointment only after due inquiry as to the fitness of the
person to be appointed.
Officer of the court. —The next friend of an infant ought always to be
appointed hy the court, and really he is an officer of the court, and under
its supervision and control. Tate v. Mott, 96-19.
Not party to the action nor liable for costs. —Next friends are not parties
to the action; Mason v. McCormick, 75-263; George v. High, 85-113;
Tate v. Mott, 96-19; and cannot be taxed with the costs, unless the court
finds as a fact that they officiously procured their own appointment or
are guilty of mismanagement or bad faith. Smith v. Smith, 108-365.
17. Guardian ad litem — How Appointed.
All motions for a guardian ad litem shall be made in writ
ing, and the court shall appoint such guardian only after
due inquiry as to the fitness of the person to be appointed,
and such guardian must file an answer in every case.
Summons served on infant. —Before guardian ad litem is appointed, a
summons, with a copy of the complaint, should be served upon the
infants. Moore v. Gidney, 75-34.
See \ 181, ante, also curative act, $387, ante, and cases cited.
Appointment, how made. —The appointment of guardian ad litem must
be based upon a motion in writing, and then only after due inquiry, and
the guardian should file an answer in every case. Young v. Young,
9'-359See \ 181, ante, and cases cited.
18. Cases Put at Foot of Docket.
All civil actions that have been at issue for two years,
and that may be continued, by consent, at any term, will
be placed at the end of the docket for the next term, in their
relative order upon the docket. When the continuance
shall be ordered, and when a civil action shall be continued,
on motion of one of the parties, the court may, in its dis
cretion, order that such action be placed at the end of the
docket, as if continued by consent.
19. When Opinion is Certified.
When the opinion of the supreme court in any cause
which has been appealed to that court has been certified to
the superior court, such cause shall stand on docket in its
regular order at the first term after receipt of the opinion for
judgment or trial, as the case may be, except in criminal
actions in which the judgment has been affirmed. Acts
1887, c. 192, s. j.
No notice of motion for judgment required. —Where a ease has been heard
in the supreme court, and certified to the court below to proceed with
according to law, no notice is necessary of a motion for judgment in
conformity with the certificate. There is no necessity for notice, when
the case comes on for trial at a regular term of the court. Williams t.
Whiting, 94-481.
Cannot modify judgment of appellate court. —Where a decree has been
made in the supreme court settling the rights of the parties, and only
the final accounts remained to be taken, the superior court cannot allow
amended pleadings to be filed, or the rights of the parties as settled by
the decree to be varied, but must proceed with the cause in accordance
with the decree. White v. Butcher, 97-7.
When the supreme court announces its decision, that there is no error
in the judgment rendered in the court below, that court has no right or
power to modify the judgment in anyrespect. The judgment cannot be
modified except by a direct proceeding alleging fraud, mistake, imposi
tion, etc. This rule holds and applies also to an adjudication upon an
interlocutory order reviewed on appeal. Dobson v. Sinionton, 100-56;
Calvert v. Peebles, 82-334.
The final judgment in any action, as affected by the orders and judg
ment of the supreme court, is in the superior court, and all proper
motions in the action should be made in the superior court, except such
motions as may be made affecting the appeal and the action of this
court therein. But no motion can be entertained in the superior court
inconsistent with the judgment or directions of this court. Stephens v.
Koonce, 106-222.
Mandamus to enforce entry of judgment. —The superior court has no power
to modify or change a judgment of the supreme court certified to the
court below, and a mandamus will lie to enforce the entry of proper
judgment. Murrill v. Murrill, 90-120.
Where judgment reversed on appeal. —Where, on appeal, the judgment is
reversed because not authorized by the facts found, the court below may
bear additional evidence. Jones v. Swepson, 94-700; Ashby v. Page,
108-6; Bevill v. Cox, 109—.
When remanded for imperfect record. —When the supreme court remands
a case because the record is imperfect, the superior court has the power
to make any proper order in the cause. Where, upon such remanding,
his honor in the court below ordered an appeal bond to be filed to per
fect the same appeal, it was held not to be error. Spence v. Tapscott,
93-25°Judgment, and not formal conclnsion, to be regarded. —Where the supreme
court passes seriatim upon a number of exceptions to a report, sustain
ing some and overruling others, the court below should proceed in
accordance with the respective rulings, notwithstanding the record of
the entry in this court should be that the judgment below was "affirmed."
Such record is not such a judgment as needs to be amended in this court,
and such entry is not resjudicata. Cook v. Moore, 100-294; Summerlin
v. Cowles, 107-459; Scroggs v. Stevenson, 108-260.
20. Calendar.
When a calendar of civil actions shall be made under
the supervision of the court, or by a committee of attor
neys under the order of the court, or by consent of the
court, unless cause be shown to the contrary, all actions
continued by consent, and numbered on the docket between
the first and last numbers placed upon the calendar, will
be placed at the end of the docket for the next term, as if
continued by consent, if such actions have been at issue
for two years.
21. Canes Set for a Day Certain.
Neither civil nor criminal actions will be set for trial on
a day certain, or not be called for trial before a day certain
unless by order of the court; and if the other business of
the term shall have been disposed of before the day for
which a civil action is set, the court will not be kept open
for the trial of such action except for some special reason
apparent to the judge; but this rule will not apply when a
calendar has been adopted by the court.
22. Calendar Under Control of Court.
The court will reserve the right to determine whether it
is necessary to make a calendar, and, also, for the dispatch
of business, to make orders as to the disposition of causes
placed upon the calendar and not reached on the day for
which they may be set. 
23. Non-jury Cases.
When a calendar shall be made, all actions that do not
require the intervention of a jury, together with motions
for interlocutory orders, will be placed on the motion
docket, and the judge will exercise the right to call the
motion docket at any time after the calendar shall be taken
up.
24. Appeals from Ja»tices of the Peace.
Appeals from justices of the peace in civil actions will
not be called for trial unless the returns of such appeals
have been docketed ten days previous to the term, but
appeals docketed less than ten days before the term may be
tried by consent of parties.
See, \\ 564 and 565, ante, and cases cited.
25. On, Consent Continuance—Judgment for Costs.
When civil actions shall be continued by consent of par
ties, the court will, upon suggestion that the charges of
witnesses and fees of officers have not been paid, adjudge
that the parties to the action pay respectively their own
costs, subject to the right of the prevailing party to have
such costs taxed in the final judgment.
26. Time to File Pleadings— How Computed.
When time to file pleadings is allowed, it shall be com
puted from the expiration of the term as fixed by law.
Agreement construed. —An agreement that "appellant may have thirty
days to file his case on appeal from adjournment of court, and defend
ant thirty days thereafter," entitles defendant to thirty days after service
of appellant's case. Mitchell v. Hoggard, 105-173.
Papers after filing. —The court papers should not be taken from their
proper places, as the practice of removing them leads to confusion and
delay. Seay v. Yarborough, 94-291.
27. Counsel Not Sent For.
Except for some unusual reason, connected with the busi
ness of the court, attorneys will not be sent for when their
cases are called in their regular order.
28. Criminal Dockets.
Clerks of the courts will be required, upon the criminal
dockets prepared for the court and solicitor, to state and
number the criminal business of the court in the follow
ing order :
First—All criminal causes at issue. Second—All war
rants upon which parties have been held to answer at the
term. Third—All presentments made at preceding terms
undisposed of. Fourth—All cases wherein judgments nisi
have been entered at the preceding term against defendants
and their sureties, and against defaulting jurors or witnesses
in behalf of the state.
29. Civil and Criminal Dockets— What, to contain.
Clerks will, also, be required, upon both civil and crim
inal dockets, to bring forward and enter in different col
umns of sufficient space, in each case—
First—The names of the parties. Second—The nature
of the action. Third —A summary history of the case,
including the date of issuance of process, pleadings filed,
and a brief note of all proceedings and orders therein.
Fourth—A blank space for the entries of the term.
30. Books.
The clerks of the superior courts shall be chargeable
with the care and preservation of the volumes of Reports,
and shall report at each term to the presiding judge whether
any and what volumes have been lost or damaged since the
last preceding term.

Page 5. If ancillary remedy is unwarranted. —All forms of actions
having been abolished, an allegation in the complaint, in an action to
recover rent, that defendant wrongfully detains the crop on which the
rent is a lien, does not deprive the justice of jurisdiction on the ground
that the action is one of claim and delivery and the amount exceeds fifty
dollars. Hargrove v. Harris, 116 N. C
Sec. 127, page 10. Dower. —A summons in a proceeding for the
allotment of dower is returnable before the Clerk of the Superior Court,
and not to the Court in term. Gatewood v. Tomlinson, 113 N. C, 312.
Sec. 133, page 13. Immaterial whether the action would have been at
law or in equity.—Under the Act of 1886 (ch. 24), which declares that "no
interest shall be recoverable in law or in equity " when more than the
legal rate has been contracted for, it is immaterial whether the creditor
seeks his relief by a proceeding which formerly would have been termed
a suit in equity, or by an action at law, or whether the creditor be plain
tiff or defendant. Moore v. Beaman, 112 N. C, 558.
Page 14. Distinction between actions ex contractu and ex delicto
abolished. —The defendant took into his possession timber logs of plain
tiff, sold some and converted others into lumber, which he also sold:
Held, the plaintiff might waive the tort and maintain an action to recover
the money realized from the sale by defendant. Timber and Land Co.
v. Brooks, 109 N. C, 698.
Page 14. Feigned issues abolished. —Feigned issues being abol
ished, in actions for seduction, the woman, if of age, is the proper party
plaintiff. Hood v. Sudderth, m N. C, 215; Scarlett v. Norwood, 115
N. C, 284.
Sec. 136, page 15. This section repealed. —The statute of limita
tions, by the Acts of 1891, ch. 113, is applicable to all causes of action
accrued before 1868, if action was begun after January 1, 1893. Nunnery
v. Averitt, 111 N. C, 394.
Page 17. Statute of presumptions. —In an action begun before
January 1, 1893, to surcharge and falsify and restate an account filed in
1865, the statute of presumptions, instead of the statute of limitations, is
proper to be pleaded. Nunnery v. Averitt, 111 N. C, 394.
Page 18. Administration. —Where a cause of action against an
administrator arose in December, 1864, and he filed his account in April,
1891, and suit was brought against him and his sureties in June, 1891:
Held, that the lapse of twenty years from January 1, 1870, raised a pre
sumption of settlement or abandonment which was not rebutted, as to
the sureties on the administration bond, by the filing of the administra
tor's account showing a balance due the distributees. Thompson v.
Nations, 112 N. C, 508.
Page 18. Judgments quando and absolute. —Where a judgment was
obtained against an administrator of a decedent and his surety in 1869 on
a cause of action arising, and in a suit commenced, before the adoption of
the Code of Civil Procedure, the judgments being quando as to the admin
istrator and absolute and final as to the surety, an action on the latter
was a new causa litis and governed by the statute of limitations as pre
scribed in The Code, while the statute of presumptions under the prior
law is alone applicable to the action on the quando judgment against the
administrator. Dickson v. Crawley, 112 N. C, 629.
Sec. 197, page 19. Effect of this section. —This section does not
postpone the time when causes of action shall accrue, but merely extends
the period of limitation or presumption after a cause of action has accrued
by omitting from the count the time between May 20, 1861, and January 1,
1870. Thompson v. Nations, 112 N. C, 508.
Page 20. [Note. —The Act of 1891, chs. 92 and 356, compelling
personal representatives to plead the statute of limitations, was repealed
by Chapter 7, Acts 1893.]
Sec. 138, page 21. Objection must be taken by answer.—The statute
of limitations is not available unless pleaded. Albertson v. Terry, 109
N. C,, 8.
Page 22. Sufficiently pleaded.—Where a complaint alleged the
rendering of services by plaintiff to defendant, and the frequent promise
of the latter to pay for the same, and also alleged the reasonable value
of such services, the answer alleged that "if defendant promised any
compensation it was in parol, and more than three years had elapsed
since the making of such promise": Held, that the statute was sufficiently
pleaded, whether the action was founded on the express or the implied
promise. Grady v. Wilson, 115 N. C, 344.
Page 22. Insufficiently pleaded. —A plea of the statute of limita
tions which contains no facts whatever, and which refers to no facts in
the other parts of the pleading which lend any aid to the plea and from
which any legal conclusions can be deduced, is defective. Lassiter v.
Roper, 114 N. C, 17.
Page 22. Repeal of limitation after action begun. —The limitation
of five years, prescribed in Section 67 of The Code as the time in which
burnt records may be restored after destruction, as provided in Section
59 of The Code, applies to a proceeding begun in 1866 to restore the
record of a will destroyed in 1875, notwithstanding the Act of 1893, ch.
295, which amends Section 67 by abolishing the limitation. Varner v.
Johnson, 112 N. C, 570.
Sec. 139, page 24. Privity among successive tenants.—No connec
tion need be shown between the successive occupants to establish the
presumption of a grant for the actual possessio pedis. Bryan v. Spivey,
109 N. C, 57; Asbury v. Fair, m N. C, 251.
Unless the defendants connect themselves with their elder grant, it
serves them no purpose, except to take title out of the State, and in this
it is of equal avail to the plaintiff also. Asbury v. Fair, m N. C, 251.
Though plaintiff in an action for land fails to show a grant from the
State, or adverse possession for sufficient time to bar the State, he may
avail himself of the subsequent introduction by defendant of a patent
to prove adverse possession for such period as will bar the defendant.
Boomer v. Gibbs, 114 N. C, 76; Gilchrist v. Middleton, 107 N. C, 680;
Hamilton v. Icard, 114 N. C, 532.
Sec. 139 (2), page 25. Continuous possession.—Though it is not
necessary to show continnous and unceasing possession of land for the
statutory period of twenty-one years in order to raise a presumption of a
grant from the State, but only that in the aggregate the actual possession
has extended over such period; yet, where written evidence of title is
offered as color merely, the possession must be manifested by unequivo
cal acts of ownership, such as would have subjected the occupant not
simply to an action of trespass quare clausum /regit, but to a possessory
action at common law. Hamilton v. Icard, 114 N. C, 532.
Page 25. Constructive possession. —The constructive possession
of one claiming under color of title for twenty-one years, the period
necessary to give title against the State, is not interrupted by the mere
issuance to another of a patent including part of the land claimed by
him where his actual possession is within the lappage. Hamilton v.
Icard, 114 N. C, 532.
Sec. 140, page 26. Title of State divested.—The State is deemed to
have surrendered its right where it permits an adverse occupation of
land under colorable title without interruption for twenty-one years,
and a title vests in the occupant which can only be divested by a sub
sequent possession by another till his right in turn ripens in the same
way. Walker v. Moses, 113 N. C, 527.
Sec. 141, page 26. What possession will protect.—Where title is
shown out of the State by adverse possession, one who thereafter acquires
title under a Sheriff's deed, and holds possession therennder for seven
years, has good title against one who subsequently obtained a grant from
the State. Walker v. Moses, 113 N. C, 527.
The test of the sufficiency of the possession of land to mature title is
the liability of the occupant to an action of trespass in ejectment.
Boomer v. Gibbs, 114 N. C, 76.
Page 26. Possession under junior grant. —Seven years' possession
and cultivation of land under a junior grant makes title against an older
one; and where there was evidence from which such possession could
be found, it was error to hold that plaintiff (claiming under the junior
grant) could not recover. Asbury v. Fair, m N. C, 251.
Page 2 7. Nature of possession required. —Where defendants entered
originally without color and occupied the lands in severalty, and subse
quently a deed was made conveying the lands to trustees for the defend
ants collectively, but there was evidence that defendants continued to
hold in the same manner as before the execution of the deed, it was not
error to hold that the defendants had failed to establish title by adverse
possession under color. Bryan v. Spivey, 109 N. C, 57.
Where a patent issued for land, reserving land within its limits as
"previously granted," possession under such patent, but outside of the
land previously granted, is not constructive possession of the excepted land, nor is the patent color of title to the same. Basnight v. Smith.
IH N. C, 229.
Page 28. Hot sufficient as possession. —Though one has color of
title to land, he acquires title by adverse possession to none by planting
some part of it in tobacco every year for more than the statutory period,
no part being planted for more than two years, and each part being
enclosed only for the time it is Cultivated. Hamilton v. Icard, 114
N. C, 532Page 28. Possession by mortgagor. —A mortgagor in possessiop
of land holds under the mortgage, as also a purchaser from such mort
gagor, provided he had notice of the mortgage, or if the mortgage was
on record at the time of the purchase, and a seven-years holding by such
mortgagor or his purchaser will not give title. Williams v. Kerr, 113
N. C, 306.
Page 28. Possession by one tenant in common. —Where land is con
veyed to one in trust for others as tenants in common, the possession of
one of the cestuis que trust begun under such deed and continued under
a subsequent deed from the same grantor is not adverse to the trustee
and does not confer title as against the other beneficiaries when held for
a period less than twenty years. Jeter v. Davis, 109 N. C, 458.
A party in possession of land as tenant in common with another can
not acquire title as to the interest of the other tenant in common by
seven years' adverse possession with color of title, since it requires
twenty years of such possession to amount to an ouster of the co-tenant.
Lenoir v. Mining Co., 113 N. C, 513.
Page 29. Possession by alienee of tenant in common. —Where an
occupant of land has entered and holds under title derived mediately or
immediately through conveyances from a portion of the tenants in com
mon, to whom the land had passed by descent or purchase, although
professing to convey the whole interest in the land, a possession for less
than twenty years will not raise the presumption that the co-tenant who
did not join in the deed has been evicted, for one tenant in common can
not thus make the possession adverse to his co-teuant. Ferguson v.
Wright, 113 N. C, 537Page 30. Purchaser under judicial sale against tenants in common. —
The vendee of a tenant in common, or the purchaser at execution sale
of land belonging to a tenant in common, takes only such estate or
interest as such tenant had, and hence twenty years' adverse possession
will be necessary to bar the co-tenants; but where a purchaser claims
under a judicial sale, based upon a decree which purports to cover the
whole estate in the tract, and a deed in conformity therewith, it consti
tutes color of title of the whole, and seven years' adverse possession will
bar the other tenants. Amis v. Stephens, m N. C, 172; McCulloh v.
Daniel, 102 N. C, 529.
Page 30. Possession of lappage. —Where it appears that plaintiff
and his predecessors were in possession of a portion of the lappage for
more than seven years before defendant entered on and actually occu
pied another portion of it, and the only evidence of any attempt by
defendant to exercise dominion over the lappage before such entry was
that her tenants entered at intervals and cut timber for rails and removed
pine straw from it, it was error to submit to the jury the question as to
whether defendant, during such seven years, occupied and used any por
tion of the lappage "for the purposes such land could be used for," when
it was not shown that the land was unfit for cultivation. McLean v.
Smith, 114 N. C, 357.
When neither claimant is seated on the lappage in dispute, and when
both are on it, the law adjudges the possession to follow the older title.
Asbury v. Fair, i11 N. C, 251; Boomer v. Gibbs, 114 N. C, 76.
Page 90. Color of title. —A void deed by a Sheriff is not color
of title. Ferguson v. Wright, 113 N. C, 537.
A deed to a person as trustee, who signs the same, if probated and
registered as the deed of the grantor, is color of title, though not pro
bated as to the trustee, the presumption being that it was accepted by
the grantee therein. Smith v. Allen, 112 N. C, 223.
A deed of a trustee, although the privy examination of the cestui que
trust was not taken, is good as color of title, even if the cestui que trust
was a feme covert. Smith v. Allen, 112 N. C, 223.
A deed duly executed, probated and recorded by an attorney in fact,
is sufficient to show color of title, though the power of attorney be not
produced. Smith v. Allen, 112 N. C, 223.
Page 31. Need not be pleaded. —In ejectment, the defendant may,
under his plea of a general denial, assert plaintiff's adverse possession
under the first deed, which is color of title, and that of himself as the
purchaser under execution, the joint possession being for a period of
more than seven years. Miller v. Bumgardner, 109 N. C, 412.
It is competent for a defendant to prove possession by himself and
those under whom he may claim, for seven years, in support of a general
denial in an answer that the plaintiff is the owner, without specially
pleading the statute. Cheatham v. Young, 113 N. C, 161.
Page 31. Burden on defendant The burden is upon the defend
ant to establish the defence of adverse possession under color of title.
Bryan v. Spivey, 109 N. C, 57.
Page 31. Statute begins to run. —The statute begins to run against
one to whom a grant of the land has been made only from the time of
the grant. Hamilton v. Icard, 114 N. C, 532.
Page 31. Against equitable owner.—Where equitable ownership
is set up as a defence in an action to recover land, the statute of limita
tions does not bar. Ross v. Hendrix, 110 N. C, 403.
Sec. 143, page 32. Possession within twenty years. —Plaintiffs in
ejectment claimed under the will of their father devising the land to his
widow during her widowhood, and then to plaintiffs. It was shown that
the widow had died without marrying again, but there was no evidence
that either she or plaintiffs had held possession of the land within thirtyfive or forty years prior to the suit: Held, that the evidence did not entitle
plaintiffs to recover. Honeycult v. Brooks, 116 N. C
Sec. 146, page 34. Possession presumed to be adverse. —Every posses
sion is taken to be on possessor's own title, until the contrary is shown.
Bryan v. Spivey, 109 N. C, 57.
Page 35. Possession not adverse. —A tenant by the curtesy initi
ate has not such estate in the land of bis wife that will put in operation
the statute of limitations against either the husband or wife in favor of
one claiming title by adverse possession. Jones v. Coffey, 109 N. C, 515.
Page 35. Possession is notice. —Open, notorious, and exclusive
possession for twelve years, accompanied by a claim of ownership, is
constructive notice of an equity, even though it be the possession of one
entitled to dower which has not been allotted. Ross v. Hendrix, 110
N. C, 403.
Sec. 151, page 39. Burden on plaintiff —Where a complaint alleges
as the cause of action the breach of a bond and the statute of limitations
is pleaded, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show that the breach was
within three years before the commencement of the action. Koonce v.
Pelletier, 115 N. C, 234.
Page 40. Trustee. —The statute of limitations does not bar plain
tiff's cause of action against the trustee of an express trust. Maxwell v.
Barringer, 110 N. C, 76.
Page 40. Husband and wife. —The fact that a bond is made pay
able to the husband when it ought to have been to the wife, does not
arrest the running of the statute; he is her trustee and not under dis
ability. Ervin v. Brooks, 111 N. C, 358.
Page 40. Agent.—Where the defendant's intestate received
money from the plaintiff agreeing to manage and lend it out for her and
return it to her with six per cent, for his trouble as her agent, the intes
tate was responsible for the funds, and the statute of limitations would
not run until after demand. Lamb v. Ward, 114 N. C, 256.
The defendant, according to his own admission, assuming to act as
plaintiff's agent in the collection and application of the rents, cannot
plead the statute of limitations unless there was a demand and a refusal,
and then only from the time thereof. Shuffler v. Turner, in N. C, 297.
Page 40. Begins to run. —When no time is specified for the pay
ment of a bond it is due at its execution, and the statute of limitations
begins to run at once. Ervin v. Brooks, m N. C, 358; Caldwell v.
Rodman, 50 N. C, 139; Little v. Dunlap, 44 N. C, 40.
The statute of limitations does not begin to run in favor of a member
of a partnership who has endorsed the note of an outside party to the
firm until the appointment of a receiver to collect the assets or other
settlement of the firm's affairs. Loan Association v. Ferrell, 114 N. C. ,
301; Faison v. Stewart, 112 N. C, 332.
The statute of limitations begins to run against the coupons on a bond
at the time such coupons become due, regardless of when the bond itself
falls due. Threadgill v. Commissioners of Anson County, 116 N. C.
Page 41. Amendment or change of name of a party. —The amend
ment of a pleading, by the mere change of the name of a party, unlike
the insertion of a new cause of action, is not affected by the statute of
limitations. Bray v. Creekmore, 109 N. C. , 49.
Page 41. Sale by mortgagor. — Where a mortgage was duly
recorded in the proper county, the fact that the mortgagor, in whose
possession the property remained, took it out of the State and sold it
there, does not start the running of the statute against the mortgagee or
his assignee. Woody v. Jones, 113 N. C, 253; Hornthal v. Burwell, 109
N. C, 10.
Sec. 152 (1), page 42. Judgment lien lost.—The statute (Section 440
of The Code) contains no provision extending beyond ten years the lien
of a judgment until a motion to revive it and to issue execution thereon
can be heard. Pipkin v. Adams, 114 N. C, 201.
A sale under an execution more than ten years after date of docketing
is valid if judgment was not dormant when execution issued. The lien,
however, relates only to the levy, as the judgment lien is gone. Lytle.
Page 43. As to homesteads. —Where a homestead was allotted
to a judgment debtor on judgments docketed in 1873-1875, the lien of
the judgments was not barred by the lapse of time in 1891. Leach v.
Johnson, 114 N. C, 87. •
Sec. 152 (2), page 44. Sureties. —The lapse of three years between
the maturity of, or last payment on, a sealed note, and the commence
ment of a suit thereon, is a bar to the action as against a surety thereto.
Redmond v. Pippen, 113 N. C, 90; Coffey v. Reinhart, 114 N. C, 509.
Parol evidence is admissible to show that one apparently a principal
on a note or bond is, in fact, a surety. Lockhart v. Ballard, 113 N. C,
292; Southerland v. Fremont, 107 N. C, 565; Coffey v. Reinhart, 114
N. C, 509.
If the purchaser of a bond before maturity, for value and without
notice, subsequently receives notice that a party thereto is a surety, and
delays action for three years after maturity, the surety will be protected
by the three-years statute of limitations. Coffey v. Reinhart, 114 N. C,
509.
If the suretyship is known to the original payee, and the note be
assigned after maturity, the surety will be protected by the lapse of three
years after maturity, although the assignee takes without notice; other
wise if the note be assigned before maturity to one without notice. Cof
fey v. Reinhart, 114 N. C, 509.
Sec. 152 (3), page 44. Effect of partial payment. —Payment on a
bond secured by mortgage before it goes out of date, and within ten
years before suit brought, will prevent the bar of the statute of limita
tions, and a purchaser of the land at a mortgage sale will not be barred.
Williams v. Kerr, 113 N. C, 306.
Page 45. Mortgage not necessarily barred when action on debt is. —
Although an action on a note be barred by the statute, the lien created
by the mortgage given to secure it is not impaired by the running of the
statute of limitations on the debt. Jenkins v. Wilkinson, 113 N. C, 532.
Page 45. Statnte begins to run against mortgage. —Where the
mortgagor of property is left in possession, he or his vendee holds it for
the mortgagee,, and his possession does not become adverse so as to set
the statute of limitations in motion until condition broken. Woody v.
Jones, 113 N. C, 253.
Where the defendant purchased the land from the mortgagor within
less than a year before the mortgagee brought suit to foreclose the mort
gage, if the defendant bought the land with actual knowledge of the
mortgage, agreeing to assume the debt, he would be in possession under
the mortgage, and he would not have had possession long enough to
make his title good against the mortgagee, even if his possession was
adverse and without notice. Williams v. Kerr, 113 N. C, 306.
The statute of limitations on a mortgage begins to run from the
maturity, and not from the date, of the notes which it secures. Triplett
v. Foster, 115 N. C, 335.
Sec. 153 (1), page 46. Runs from judgment on rehearing. —A judg
ment rendered by a Justice of the Peace is vacated by a subsequent
judgment granted upon rehearing in the same court, and the statute of
limitations begins to run from the date of such second judgment. Sal
mon v. McLean, 116 N. C
Sec. 153 (2), page 46. Sale of land for assets.—This section applies
to actions against a personal or real representative instituted to compel the performance of some duty incumbent on the representative, such as
the sale of land for assets, and not to actions brought simply to ascertain
the debt and reduce it to judgment. Redmond v. Pippen, 113 N. C, 90.
Page 46. Applies only where right of action has accrued. —This sec
tion applies to those claims upon which the right of action had accrued
at the time of such qualification. As to those upon which the right of
action subsequently accrues, the statute begins to run from the day of
such accrual. (Syme v. Badger, 96 N. C, 197, and Andres v. Powell, 97
N. C, 155, distinguished.) Miller v. Shoaf, no N. C, 319.
Page 47. Action by creditor. —The prescription of seven years
after the qualification of the executor or administrator as the time within
which a creditor of a deceased person shall bring his action, does not
put a stop to the operation of the three-years statute which has begun to
run; therefore, where the statute began to run in favor of a surety on
23d of March, 1888, the surety died on June 6, 1889, and his executrix
qualified on June 8, 1889, an action commenced on 5th of April, 1892,
was barred as to such surety. Redmond v. Pippen, 113 N. C, 90.
Sec. 154, page 48. Final account. —An account filed by an admin
istrator entitled "Annual Account" on its face, and so styled by the
Clerk in approving and filing it, and recorded in the "Record of
Accounts," and not in the record of "Final Settlements," and, more
over, showing a balance struck and in the hands of the administrator for
the exigencies of the estate, and not as due the distributees, is not a
"final account" to which the six years statute of limitation is applica
ble. Burgwn v. Daniel, 115 N. C, 115.
Sec- 155 {l),page 40. Charge on land. —An executor who is also
devisee of land charged with sundry payments by qualifying as executor
and taking possession of the land becomes at once liable personally to
an action for payment of such sums and is protected by the lapse of
three years. Rice v. Rice, 115 N. C, 43; Hines v. Hines, 95 N. C, 482;
Aston v. Galloway, 38 N. C. 126.

ber of an unincorporated joint stock association (which is a partnership)
borrows money from the association, he assumes towards the other
members or partners the position of a trustee, and is bound to account
with them whenever they may call upon him to do so, and hence the
statute of limitations does not begin to run in his favor until such
demand. The fact that the note, the evidence of the indebtedness, is
made payable to the cashier of the association does not change the rela
tions of the parties. Faison v. Stewart, 112 N. C, 332.
Page 51. Guaranty. —Where one guarantees the return of or
payment for goods sold to another, he is entitled to notice, within reas
onable time, of the default of the latter, and a delay of three years is
unreasonable and discharges the guarantor. Myer v. Reedy, 115 N. C,
538.
Page 52. Against administrator for rents of real estate. —An action
against an administrator who takes the rents and profits of the realty is
properly brought within three years after he gave up possession of the
land. Shuffler v. Turner, 111 N. C, 297.
Sec. 155 (3), page 52.
Amended by adding after the last word thereof, the fol
lowing words: "And when the trespass is a continuing
one, such action shall be commenced within three years
from the original trespass, and not thereafter."
Acts
1895, ch. 165.
Sec. 155 (C), page 53. Demand and refusal.—The plaintiff might
have begun his action against sureties ou the bond immediately after his
demand upon the executors of the administrators and their refusal, and
the statute runs from that date. Gill v. Cooper, m N. C, 311.
Page 54. Breach of bond. —G. was appointed administrator of D.
in June and died in August, 1883. In September, 1889, judgment was
rendered upon an action begun in 1884 against G. 's executors establish
ing G.'s liability as admimstrator, for misuse of D.'s estate: Held, an
action begun in October, 1889, against G.'s sureties was barred by the
statute of limitations. Gill v. Cooper, m N. C, 311.
Page 54. Account not final filed. —Where an account not final is
filed by a public administrator, the trust is not ended and the statute
does not begin to run until his resignation and the appointment of an
administrator de bonis non and the sureties on the bond of the first
administrator will be protected by the lapse of three years from the
taking out of letters of administration de bonis non. Burgwyn v. Daniel,
115 N. C, 115.
Sec. 155 (7), page 54. Ball in ciYil actions. —Proceedings against
bail, in civil actions, are barred, unless commenced within three years
after judgment against the principal, notwithstanding the principal may
have left the State in the meanwhile. Navigation Co. v. Williams, 111
N. C, 35.
Sec. 155 (8). page 55. Fees and coets. —A plaintiff in a judgment
on which costs only are due, is not barred by section 155 (8) from proper
proceedings to enforce his claim, the same being in his favor and not of
the officers of the court. Cowles v. Hall, 113 N. C, 359.
Sec. 155 (9), page 55. Amendment of 1889. —The amendment of 1889
applies to an action for a false warranty on a sale made before the amend
ment. Alpha Mills v. Watertown Steam-Engine Co., 116 N. C
Page 55. Date of discovery for the jury. —Where, in an action
brought to correct a mutual mistake in a settlement of accounts, the
defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, and it did not appear in the
complaint that the mistake was discovered more than three years before
suit brought, the plaintiff should have been permitted to prove, if he
could, that such discovery was within three years before the commence
ment of the action. Stubbs v. Motz, 113 N. C, 458.
Where, in an action for false warranty, there is a question as to when
plaintiff first knew of the fraud, the question as to whether the action is
barred by the statute of limitations is one of fact for the jury. Alpha
Mills v. Watertown Steam- Engine Co., 116 N. C
Page 55. From the discovery. —The limitation for the commence
ment of actions prescribed by Section 155 (9) is three years from the dis
covery of the mistake, and not from the date of the mistake. Stubbs
v. Motz, 113 N. C, 458.
Page 58 (4). Purchaser with notice of one who bought without. —
One who, with actual notice of the insolvency of an estate, purchases
land from one who, without such notice, bought from a devisee after two years from the grant of letters, will be protected by his vendor's want
of notice. Arrington v. Arrington, 114 N. C, 152.
Page 58 (4). Purchaser without notice, devisee holds purchase money
for creditors. —The purchaser of land from an heir or devisee more than
two years after the issuing of letters testamentary, etc., if bona fide and
without notice, gets a good title against the creditors of the devisor or
ancestor, but the devisee or heir holds the price received for the land in
lieu thereof, and subject to the claims of such creditors, just as the land
would have been held if not sold. Bunn v. Todd, 115 N. C, 138.
Page 58 (4). Acts 1893, ch. 152. 1895, ch. 224.
Sec. i. No suit, action or proceeding shall be brought
or maintained against any railroad company owning or ope
rating a railroad in this State for damages or compensation
for right-of-way or use and occupancy of any lands by said
company for use of its railroad, unless such suit, action or
proceeding shall be commenced within five years after said
lands shall have (been) entered upon for the purpose of con
structing said road, or within two years after said road shall
be in operation: Provided, that any person who would be
sooner barred by this act shall not be thereby barred for two
years from the passage hereof: Provided, that nothing in
this act shall affect the right of action of any one under
disability under existing law within the time limited in this
action after the removal of the disability.
SEC. 2. This act shall not apply or be deemed to apply
to any action or proceeding pending at the time of the pass
age of this act, nor shall the provisions of this act apply to
railroads chartered prior to January r, 1868. Acts 1893,
ch. 152.
The above act was amended as follows:
Chapter 152, Acts 1893, is amended by adding at the end
of the first section of said act the following: "No suit, action
or proceeding shall be brought or maintained against any
railroad company in this State by any person for damages
caused by the construction of said road, or the repairs there
to, unless such suit, action or proceeding shall be com
menced within five years after the cause of action occurs,
and the jury shall assess the entire amount of damages which
the party aggrieved is entitled to recover by reason of the
trespass on his property." Acts 1895, ch. 224.
Page 58. Taking deed for less than one hundred feet. —Where the
charter of a railroad provided that, in the absence of any contract with
the owner, it should be presumed that the land over which the road runs,
with a space of one hundred feet on either side, has been granted to the
corporation, and the corporation took a deed for less than one hundred
feet within two years after its completion, this prevented the limitation
in the charter from applying, and the corporation got no title to land
lying outside of the deed, but within one hundred feet of the track, by
the lapse of the two years. Dargan v. Railroad, 113 N. C, 596.
Page 58. Limitation not less than in other cases. —Notwithstand
ing the charter of a railway company, incorporated subsequently to the
enactment of the general railroad statute, The Code, Vol. I, ch. 49, con
ferred upon it "the powers and incidents of the North Carolina Rail
road Company," it can only acquire title to right-of-way by purchase or
condemnation, and the owner of land upon which its road was construc
ted, is not barred of right to compensation by any statute of limitations,
general or special, unless the defendant's possession has been adverse
for such length of time as, in ordinary cases, will mature title. Livermon v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 52.
Sec. 158, page 60. Enforcement of charge on land devised. —A cause
of action to enforce a charge or lien on land (here created by will) is
barred by lapse of ten years. Rice v. Rice, 115 N. C, 43.
Page 60. Probate of lost will. —No statute of limitations applies
to the probate of a lost will. McCormick v. Jernigan, 110 N. C, 406.
Page 60. Action for distributive share by administrator. —An action
by an administrator for intestate's share of an estate is governed as to
limitation by this section. Hunt v. Wheeler, 116 N. C.
Page 01. Action against administrator, administration being unset
tled. —When the creditors of an estate promptly reduced their claims to
judgments against the administrator, who has still assets in his hands,
and whose administration is still unsettled, the assets are held by him in
trust for the creditors, and the statute of limitations does not run.
Phifer v. Berry, 110 N. C, 463.
Page 6/. Action to impeach final account. —Ten years seem to
have been the limit prescribed by the statute of presumptions in an
action to surcharge and falsify a final account, and when this statute is
pleaded it is incumbent upon the plaintiffs to show that their action was
within the limit, and if not, to offer evidence in rebuttal of the presump
tion. Nunnery v. Averitt, ill N. C, 394.
Page 61. Contract limiting time to bring action on insurance
policy.— A stipulation in an insurance policy that a failure to bring suit
within a time therein prescribed after loss should constitute a forfeiture,
is a contract, and not a statute of limitations, and may be waived, or the
party for whose benefit it was provided may be estopped by his conduct
from insisting upon its enforcement. Dibbrell v. Insurance Co., 110
N. C, 193.
Page 61. Eightof mortgagor to avoid purchase by mortgagee. —In the
absence of ratification, the right of a mortgagor to avoid a sale under a
power where the mortgagee has indirectly become the purchaser, is not
barred by his laches for a shorter period than the statutory limitation of
ten years. Jones v. Pullen, 115 N. C, 465; Bruner v. Threadgill, 88
N. C, 361Page 61. Action against administrator to recover sum due by final
account. —Where an executor filed his final account in 1876, and the dis
tributees, who then and until they became of age, had a guardian, did
not bring suit for an alleged balance due under the testator's will until
1891: Held, the action was barred by the statute of limitations. Culp v.
Lee, 109 N. C, 676.
The relation of trustee and cestui que trust does not exist between the
plaintiff and defendant, the latter having disavowed it by the filing of
the final account, hence ten years is the bar. Nunnery v. Averitt, in
N. C, 394Page 62. Legacies, twenty years presumption of payment. —Where
twenty years have elapsed between the time when suit might have been
instituted for the recovery of legacies and the actual date of suit, the law
will, for the sake of repose and to discourage stale claims, raise a pre
sumption that the legacies have been paid or satisfied, or that the claim
therefor has been abandoned. Cox v. Brower, 114 N. C, 422.
The twenty years presumption of payment of legacies would not be
rebutted although it should be shown that the interval between the death
of the legatee and the appointment of an administrator had been suffi
cient to reduce the period during which there was a person to bring
action to less than twenty years. Cox v. Brower, 114 N. C, 422.
Page 62. Prescription of right-of-way and of easement. —The delay
of the plaintiff for a period less than twenty years to notify the company
of his injuries from defendant's embankment ponding water, could not
estop him or give the company a prescriptive right to maintain the
embankment without liability for damages. Knight v. Railroad, in
N. C, 80; Emry v. Railroad, 102 N. C, 232.
The mere use of a way for twenty years by persons generally, for
vehicles or traveling on foot, does not constitute it a public highway,
nor, in the absence of evidence of condemnation or actual dedication,
does the fact that the public have exerted control over it for any period
less than twenty years tend to show that an easement has been acquired
by user which raises the presumption of a grant. State v. Wolf, 112
N. C, 889.
Sec. 159, page 62. State can plead the statute of limitations. —In pro
ceedings under Sections 947 and 948 of The Code for the adjudication of
alleged claims against the State, the State has the right to plead the bar
of the statute of limitations to prevent a recommendatory decision.
Cowles v. The State, 115 N. C, 173.
Sec. 160a [Amendment 1893], page 63.
The limitations prescribed in this chapter shall apply
to a civil action brought against an undisclosed partner
only from the time such partnership became known to the
plaintiff. Acts 1893, ch. 151.
Sec. 161, page 64. Discontinuance. —A failure to keep up the chain
of summonses issued against a party, by means of an alias and pluries
summons, is a discontinuance as to such party; and if a summons is
served after a break in the chain, it is a new action as to him, and the
running of the statute of limitation is not arrested until the issuance of
the summons after the break. Koonce v. Pelletier, 115 N. C, 233.
Page 64. When summons is "issued."—A summons is "issued,"
so as to prevent the running of the statute of limitations, only after it
has passed from the hands of the Clerk to be delivered to the Sheriff for
service. A summons merely filled up and held by the Clerk for a prose
cution bond to be given is not "issued." Webster v. Sharpe, 116 N. C.
Sec. 162, page 64. Ifon-resident debtors. —The fact that a non-resi
dent debtor has property within the State will not prevent the operation
of this section. Grist v. Williams, i11 N. C, 53.
A foreign corporation cannot set up the statute of limitations in bar of
an action for false warranty. Alpha Mills v. Watertown Steam-Engine
Co., 116 N. C
Page 64. Non-resident legatee. —The fact that a legatee was at
the time of the death of the testator a non-resident of the State will not
excuse his laches and delay in bringing suit, since he had the right to
sue. and the courts were at all times open to non-residents as well as resi
dents of the State. Cox. v. Brower, 114 N. C, 422.
Sec. 163 {1)f page 65. Statute of presumptions. —The running of
the statute of presumptions was suspended during the minority of
plaintiffs unless represented by guardian. Nunnery v. Averitt, 11 1
N. C, 394.
Sec. 163 (2), page 65. If statute began to run. —The statute of limi
tations, if it began to run before the commencement of insanity, or other
disability, would not, on that account, cease, and when there was any
testimony from which such a state of facts could be found, its con
sideration should not have been withdrawn from the jury. Asbury v.
Fair, i11 N. C, 251; Grady v. Wilson, 115 N. C, 344.
Page 65. Statute not suspended because judgment could not have
been enforced. —Where judgment could have been obtained against the
guardian of a lunatic before action was barred by the statute of limita
tions, the fact that it could not have been enforced until after the death
of the lunatic, on account of his entire income being required to main
tain him, did not suspend the running of the statute. Grady v. Wilson,
115 N. C, 344.
Page 66. Husband and wife holding by entireties. —Where the hus
band and wife are seized by entireties of land, an action by them, involv
ing the title or possession thereof, will not be barred by the statute of
limitations as to one unless it bars both. Johnson v. Edwards, 109
N. C, 466.
Sec. 164, page 67. Enabling, not disabling, statute. —This section is
an enabling and not a disabling statute. It applies only in those cases
where, in regular course, but for the interposition of this section, a claim
would become barred in less than one year from the grant of letters of
administration, and is not a restriction on the statute of limitations so
that a claim should become barred by the lapse of a year from the grant
of letters, where, but for the section, it would not be barred until a latter
date. Benson v. Bennett, 112 N. C, 505.
Page 67. Death of a party.—Where right of action accrued May
24, 1884, debtor died July 9, 1885, and letters of administration were
granted August 21, 1885, an action commenced July 5, 1887, is not barred
by the three years' statute of limitations, for, excluding the time between
the death of debt or and the grant of administration, three years had not
elapsed. Benson v. Bennett, 112 N. C, 505.
Page 67'. Death of administrator. —An administratrix was appoin
ted in 1870, and died in 1877, before closing the administration; in 1889
an administrator de bonis non was appointed, who brought an action
against the sureties of the first administrator for breach of the bond of
their principal: Held, that there being no one in esse from the death of
the first administrator, till the qualification of the administrator de bonis
non, who could sue, that time should not be counted in applying the
statute of limitations. Brawley v. Brawley, 109 N. C, 524; explained in
Burgwyn v. Daniel 115 N. C, 119.
Page 67. Judgment quando. —Where an administrator against
whom a judgment quando was taken in 1869, in an action begun prior to
The Code of Civil Procedure, died soon thereafter and administration
de bonis non was not taken out until 1886, and suit was brought on such
judgment in 1890: Held, that no presumption of payment can arise,
Inasmuch as in computing the time under the statute the period during
which there was no administration must be excluded. Dickson v. Craw
ley, 112 N. C, 629.
The fact that an action is barred on the judgment absolute and final
taken at the same time againt the surety raises no presumption of pay
ment of the judgment quando, for as the statute of presumptions does not
apply to the judgment absolute the rule that a presumption of payment
as to one is a presumption as to all has no application. Dickson v.
Crawley, 112 N. C. 629.
Page 67. Where judgment debtor dies.—This section does not extend
the life of a judgment beyond the ten years where the judgment creditor
dies more than a year before the expiration of the ten-years limitation.
Hughes v. Boone, 114 N. C, 54; Benson v. Bennett, 112 N. C, 505.
Sec. 168, page 69. Contest over the probate of a will. —This section
applies only where there is no administrator or collector during the con
test. Hughes v. Boone, 114 N. C, 54.
Sec. 169, page 70. Assignment of note to feme covert. —An assign
ment of the note to a feme covert could not arrest the running of the
statute when it had begun to run before assignment. Ervin v. Brooks,
in N. C., 358.
Sec. 170, page 70. Cumulative.—When plaintiff relies upon the
coverture and infancy of the grantor to avoid the adverse possession
relied upon by defendant, and it appears that, after the execution of the
deed, the husband of the feme covert died, if such feme attained her
majority before her second marriage, the statute of limitations was put
in motion against her and her grantee, which was not arrested by her
second marriage, and the onus of showing that such feme married the
second time before attaining her majority is upon the plaintiff. Miller
v. Bumgardner, 109 N. C, 412. See \ 163, ante.
Sec. 17If page 70. Part payment by endorser.—Part payment of a
note by the payee who has endorsed it will not repel the bar of the statute
of limitations as against the maker, this section confining the act, admis
sion or acknowledgment as evidence to repel the bar to the associated
partners, obligors and makers of a note. LeDuc v. Butler, 112 N. C, 
Sec. 172, page 71. Payment 011 judgment. —A partial payment made
on a judgment does not arrest the running of the statute of limitations.
Hughes v. Boone, 114 N. C, 54.
Page 71. Partial payment by assignee. —Part payment of an obli
gation, without the debtor's authority, by trustees under an assignment
by the debtor for the benefit of creditors, will not remove the bar of the
statute. Battle v. Battle, 116 N. C.
Page 71. When specific articles a payment. —To make specific
articles a payment, they must be received as payments, or, by subsequent
agreement, applied as payments. Young v. Alford, 113 N. C, 130.
Page 72. Partial payment by principal.—Payment made by a prin
cipal upon a bond before the cause of action thereon is barred against
the sureties arrests the operation of the statute of limitations. Moore
v. Goodwin, 109 N. C, 218.
Page 72. Partial payment by either of two obligors. -The partial
payment by either of two obligors before the bond is barred continues it
in force. Moore v. Beaman, in N. C, 328; Moore v. Goodwin, 109
N. C, 218.
Page 72. New promise must be distinct, unconditional and specific.—
A mere acknowledgment of a debt barred by the statute of limitations,
though implying a promise to pay, will not repel the statute. To have
that effect, the acknowledgment, as provided by this section, must not
only be in writing, but must be accompanied by an unconditional promise
to pay the debt. Helm Co. v. Griffin, 112 N. C, 356.
Where a debtor wrote to his creditors declining preferred credit because
he was unable to pay what he already owed them (which was barred by
the statute), but expressing his confidence in his ability to pay whatever
he might contract for in the future: Held, that as the letter contained
no promise to pay the barred debt, the bar of the statute was not removed.
Helm Co. v. Griffin, 112 N. C, 356.
The words "I propose to settle," written in answer to a letter demand
ing payment of a note barred by the lapse of time, amount to an
acknowledgment or new promise sufficient to take the case out of the
operations of the statute of limitations. Taylor v. Miller, 1 13 N. C, 340
A written acknowledgment of a debt, if unconditional and explicit, is
as effective to stop the running of the statute of limitations against the
right to foreclose a mortgage by which the debt is secured, as would be
a payment on the debt. Royster v. Farrell, 115 N. C, 306.
A reply by an administrator of a deceased debtor to the demand of
plaintiff for payment, that he would "see the Judge and do whatever he
said," was not a waiver of the statute of limitations. Grady v. Wilson,
115 N. C, 344Page 72. Promise not supported on a valid indebtedness. —The bare
promise of a widow to pay a note executed by her during her coverture,
and therefore void, is not binding. Wilcox v. Arnold, 116 N. C.
Page 73. Promise by purchaser from mortgagor. —Where the pur
chaser of land from a mortgagor agreed to assume and pay off the mort
gage debt, the mortgagor and mortgagee assenting thereto, he became
a co-principal or agent of the mortgagor to pay the debt, and payments
by him arrested, at least as to the right to foreclose the mortgage, the
running of the statute of limitations. (LeDuc v. Baker, 112 N. C., 458,
distinguished.) Harper v. Edwards, 115 N. C, 246.
Page 73. Indorsement of credits. —The mere endorsement of a
credit on a note by the holder (even though supported by a counter-claim
in favor of the debtor) will not have the effect of reviving the liability
on a note barred by the lapse of time, but only an actual payment made
and received as such. Young v. Alford, 113 N. C, 130.
Sec. 173, page 74. Contingent remainderman.—Where the rights of
a contingent remainderman accrue at the death of the life-tenant, the
statute begins to run only from that event. Whitesides v. Cooper, 115
N. C, 571.
Sec. 177, page 70. Action by infant.—Where an infant institutes
an action in his own name and arrives at full age before the trial, the
judgment is binding on both plaintiff and defendant. Hicks v. Beam,
112 N. C, 642.
Page 76. Action by undisclosed foreign principal.—ijvfen if it were
settled (which is not the case) that an undisclosed foreign principal can
not maintain an action on a contract made by his agent with another,
this rule would not apply where the parties are residents of different
States of the American Union, for they are not foreign to each other in
such a sense as to permit the operation of the rule stated. Barham v.
Bell, 112 N. C, 131.
Page 77. Action for non-delivery of telegram. —Plaintiff can main
tain an action against a telegraph company for the non-delivery of a
telegraphic message which was sent by his sister, whom he had left in
charge of his house, to his father, whom he was visiting, telling father
to inform plaintiff of the illness of one of his children. The plaintiff,
on the face of the message, is the real party in interest. Sherrill v. Tele
graph Co., 109 N. C, 527; Young v. Telegraph Co., 107 N. C, 370.
Page 77. Action for distributive share. —Where one claims per
sonal property as the distributee of an ancestor, an action to recover the
same can be maintained only by the administrator or executor of the
deceased. Varner v. Johnson, 112 N. C, 570.
Page 77. Action to recover distributive share from one to whom it
was wrongly paid. —Where money was paid by an administrator to one
supposed to be entitled as a distributee " in full of his distributive share"
and on his promise to refund " should any lawful claim come against the
estate," no cause of action accrued to those who were rightly entitled,
and the money can only be recovered by the administrator to whom the
promise was made. Norwood v. O'Neal, 112 N. C, 127.
Page 77. Action for seduction. — "Feigned issues" being abol
ished by the Constitution, the woman, when of age, and not her father,
is the real party in interest in an action for seduction. Hood v. Sndderth, 111 N. C, 215; Scarlett v. Norwood, 115 N. C, 284.
But the father can sue for seduction of minor daughter. Scarlett v.
Norwood, 115 N. C, 284.
Page 77. Action for slander of wife. —An action by husband for
slander of his wife, the wife not being a party and the complaint alleging
no special damage to the husband, will be dismissed by the Court on
motion by the defendant, or ex mero ntotu, for failure of the complaint
to state a cause of action. Harper v. Pinkston, 112 N. C, 293.
Page 78. Tenant by the curtesy. —The husband cannot maintain
an action in his name alone to recover lands of which he is tenant by the
curtesy initiate where the marriage occurred since 1868 but the wife can
maintain such action, either by joining her husband or suing alone.
Walker v. Long, 109 N. C, 510.

husband to wife will pass the legal estate of the vendor and enable the
vendee to sustain an action to declare title and recover possession. Wal
ker v. Long. 109 N. C, 510.
Page 78. Action by heirs-at-law of cestui que trust. —In an action
by the heirs-at-law of a cestui que trust who is deceased his administrator
is not a necessary party to an action which is for recovery of real estate
of the trustee though the latter is entitled to have him brought in if he
so desires. Maxwell v. Barringer, no N. C, 76.
Page 78. Trustees. —Where a note was made payable to "J.,
cashier," and collateral security delivered to him, he being a member
and cashier of the firm of " C & J., " the owners of the debt, an action
for the foreclosure of the mortgage security was properly brought in the
name of the cashier, he being the holder of the collateral as trustee for
the firm. Jenkins v. Wilkinson, 113 N. C, 532.
Page 78. Cestui que truet.—A bill of sale which recited that, in
consideration of a sum "paid by W., agent" for plaintiff, a bargainor
sold and conveyed a stock of goods, vested the title in the plaintiff and
not in the agent, and the former may maintain an action of claim and
delivery for the goods. Woolen Company v. McKinnon, 114 N. C, 661.
Page 78. Action by member of religious society. —In the absence
of a trustee and a governing body authorized to appoint, any member of
a religious society has such a beneficial interest as will enable him, in
behalf of his fellow-members, to maintain such action as may be neces
sary to protect their common interest. Nash v. Sutton, 109 N. C, 550.

A consent order that B. should collect assets and sell property until a
future order of the Court, and that a motion for the appointment of a
receiver should be continued without prejudice, did not have the effect
to constitute B. a receiver or trustee of an express trust, and he could
not maintain an action to recover assets in his own name. Boyd v.
Insurance Co., Ill N. C, 372.
Page 79. Action for penalty. —The person suiug for a penalty for
failure to discharge an official duty is the proper party-plaintiff, and not
the State, unless it is so required by the statute. State ex rel. v. Hughes,
116 N. C; Sutton v. Phillips, 116 N. C; Katzenstein v. Railroad, 84
N. C, 688.
The Code of 1883, Sections 3841, 3842, which provides that private par
ties may recover penalties of any person selling and delivering provisions
by unauthorized weights and measures, is not in conflict with the Con
stitution of 1875, Art. 9, Sec. 5, which provides that the net proceeds of
all penalties and forfeitures shall go to the school fund. Katzenstein v.
Railroad, 84 N. C, 688; Sutton v. Phillips, 116 N. C.
Quare, whether a party suing the official bond, and not the officer
alone, for a penalty, should not make himself a relator in an action in
the name of the State. Joyner v. Roberts, 112 N. C, in.
Page 79. Tenants in common. —While one tenant in common
suing a trespasser in ejectment and proving title to an undivided interest
is entitled to judgment for the possession of the-whole land, though the
evidence establishing his right demonstrates that others than the defend
ant hold as co-tenants, and that the other undivided interests and the
action enure to their benefit ; yet, when the defendant is a co-tenant,
the plaintiff should have judgment only for the recovery of the interest
to which he shows title. Foster v. Hackett, 112 N. C, 546; Gilchrist v.
Middleton, 107 N. C, 663.
Page 80. Action by ward. —A ward can maintain the action
against the guardian bond in his own name, and the joinder of the State
is a mere matter of surplusage, and not a misjoinder of different causes
of action. McNeill v. McBryde, 112 N. C, 408.
Page 80. Action for recovery of real estate. —Where an executor
was charged with the management of land, which implied the right of
possession until the trust should be fully carried out, upon his death
and the appointment of an administrator de bonis non, cum lestamento
annexo, the latter became entitled to the possession of the land, and can
recover the same from those withholding it. Smathers v. Moody, 112
N. C, 792.
Page 81. Action by equitable owner of realty. —In an action to
recover land, the plaintiff may recover upou the equitable title, although
not pleaded, when the Court would, in a direct proceeding, correct a
formal defect, or where the dry legal title is outstanding in another,
aliter, when extrinsic evidence is necessary to establish the equitable
ownership. So, in this action, plaintiff may recover upon a deed of a
commissioner of the Court without seal. Geer v. Geer, 109 N. C, 679.
Page 81. Action by mortgagee to recover realty. —The legal title
of lands passes by a mortgage to the mortgagee, who may maintain an
action to recover possession of the same after default. Kiser v. Combs,
114 N. C, 640.
Page 81. Assignee of insurance policy. —An assignment of a fire
policy to one having no interest in the property is valid where made on
the assent of the insurer, procured without false representations or sup
pression of facts. Blackburn v. Insurance Co., 116 N. C.
Page 81. Substituted plaintiffs. —Where plaintiff sells his claim
after beginning the action, the purchaser may, in the discretion of the
Court, be made a party plaintiff, even though, under The Code, the right
of action was not assignable. Leavering v. Smith, 115 N. C, 385.
Page 82. Holder of open account. —The possession of an open
account in favor of another is not evidence of the ownership thereof in
the holder. Gregg v. Mallett, in N. C, 74.
Page 82. Assignment of judgment. —A surety who pays the amount
recovered against him and his principal, or co-sureties, may have the
judgment assigned to another in trust for his use, and it will continue in
force for his benefit, and he may, upon motion in the cause, have satis
faction of the judgment rendered, even against the consent of the
assignee. Rice v. Hearn, 109 N. C, 150.
Page 83. Holder of unaccepted order. —No liability attaches on an
unaccepted order in favor of payee or his assignee against the drawee or
his principal. Marriner v. Lumber Co., 113 N. C, 52; Hawes v. Blackwell, 107 N. C, 196.
Page 83. negotiable paper endorsed before maturity. —Where a bank
receives, in the usual course of business, a draft for collection, its pos
session is prima facie evidence that the person for whom the bank
received it is the owner, the bank being a trustee or agent in that respect.
Banking Co. v. Railroad Co., 111 N. C, 122.
When a note is declared void by a statute, it is void into whatsoever
hands it may come ; but when the statute merely declares it illegal, the
note is good in the hands of an innocent holder. Ward v. Sugg, 113
N. C, 489The remedy of the innocent holder of a note bearing usurious interest,
as to the interest, is against the payee who has endorsed the note to him,
and not against the maker, who is the victim of an oppression denounced
by the statute. The law will not lend its aid to enforce a contract which
is "deemed forfeited " by the very act of making it. If this were other
wise, the protection intended by the statute would be delusive and nuga
tory. Ward v. Sugg, 113 N. C, 489.
While, if the note be in the hands of the original payee, an endorse
ment may be shown to have been upon certain conditions, yet a bona fide
holder for value, before maturity and after notice, is not affected by any
equities existing between the original parties, and the same rule applies
between the last payee and all endorsers. Davidson v. Powell, 114
N. C, 575.
Page 83. Holder of unendorsed negotiable paper. —A note may be
transferred by delivery and without endorsement, the transferee becom
ing the equitable owner thereof. Jenkins v. Wilkinson, 113 N. C, 532;
Miller v. Tharel, 75 N. C, 148; Jackson v. Love, 82 N. C, 405.
Page 84. Assignee of non-negotiable paper.—A bond is non-nego
tiable until after endorsement, and an assignee of an unendorsed bond
takes it subject to any equities or other defences existing in favor of the
maker at the time of, or before notice of, the assignment. Loan Asso
ciation v. Merritt, 112 N. C, 243.
When, in an action to foreclose a mortgage given to secure notes
assigned to plaintiffs, the answer did not state facts sufficient to amount
to a plea of illegality or fraud in the inception or transfer of the notes,
and there was no evidence tending to support such a defence, the pro
duction of the notes by the plaintiff was prima facie evidence of owner
ship, and it devolved on defendant to rebut the presumption. Triplett
v. Foster, 115 N. C, 335.
Sec. 180, page 88.
Amended by striking out all that follows the word
"state," in line eight (8) of said section, and inserting in
lieu thereof the following: "But if the action or proceed
ing be against such guardian, or if there be no such guar
dian, then said infants, lunatics or persons non compos
mentis may appear by their next friend: Provided, however,
that the duty of the State Solicitors to prosecute in the
case specified in chapter entitled ' Guardian and Ward '
shall not be affected by the provisions of this section."
Acts 1893, ch. 5.
Note.—By its terms this amendment was to apply to actions already
pending, as well as to those thereafter brought.
Sec. 181, page 91. No recovery against minor if no guardian ad
litem. —A recovery cannot be had against a minor when no guardian
ad litem has been appointed to represent him. Thorp v. Minor, 109
N. C, 152.
Sec. 183, page 92. Parties will not be re-arranged on same side to show
diversity of citizenship if adversary. —In an action by a mortgagor to can
cel certain mortgages and to foreclose a subsequent trust deed to the
same property, although the cesluis que trusient have a common interest
with plaintiff in showing the discharge of said mortgages, they are
nevertheless his adversary parties as to other matters in controversy,
and will not be re-arranged as parties plaintiff so as to show diversity of
citizenship. Springer v. Sheets, 115 N. C, 371.
Page 92. Cestui que trnstent. —In an action for the canceling of
certain mortgages and the foreclosure of a subsequent trust deed to the
same land, the mortgagor may join with him as parties plaintiff the cestuis que trustenl under such deed. Springer v. Sheets, 115 N. C, 371.
Sec. 184, page 93. Proceedings to lay off dower.—The action of the
assignees of the dower right is primarily against the widow, but in the
absence of an averment that the lands described were all of which she
was entitled to be endowed, the heirs and devisees are properly made
parties, so that the whole matter may be determined in one action.
Parton v. Allison, 11 1 N. C, 429.
A widow who transferred her right of dower before the same was
allotted is a necessary party in a proceeding to have the same set apart.
Such a conveyance will be treated in equity as a contract to have it
allotted to her and then to convey it to the purchasers. Parton v. Alli
son, in N. C, 429.
Page 93. Mortgagees.—Where, at the call of a case for trial in
the court below, it appeared that the plaintiff was willing to proceed
without certain mortgagees of defendant being made parties, and that
defendants had excepted to a former order of the Court directing such
mortgagees to be made parties, and that the validity of the mortgages
could not be affected by the result of the trial, it was a matter entirely
within the discretion of the trial Judge to determine whether or not the
cause should be tried before some of the mortgagees were brought in.
Shober v. Wheeler, 113 N. C, 370.
Page 93. Eeversioner. —The refusal of the Court to allow a rever
sioner, upon his application, to be made a party defendant in a suit
brought by the holder of the life estate against a city for damage to the
land caused by the widening of a street, was error, although such rever
sioner had refused to join in the suit at request of the plaintiff. Jones v.
Asheville, 116 N. C.
Page 94. Proceedings to sell land to make assets. —In proceedings
by an administrator for leave to sell land to make assets to pay decedent's
debts, the heir has a right to show that judgments taken against the
administrator after the commencement of the proceedings were wrong
fully suffered to be entered against him. In such case it seems the judg
ment creditors ought to be made parties. Tilley v. Bivins, 112 N. C.
Sec. 185, page 96. Cestui que trustent. —A beneficiary under a trust
deed is a necessary party to an action by a mortgagor to cancel certain
mortgages on the land described in said deed, and to foreclose said trust
deed, although the trustee has been made a party to the action. Springer
v. Sheets, 115 N. C, 371.
Page 96- Subsequent mortgagees. —Subsequent encumbrances,
while proper parties to a suit for foreclosure of a mortgage, are not
necessary parties. Williams v. Kerr, 113 N. C, 306.
Page 90. Grantor not necessary party in ejectment against grantee. —
During the pendency of an action relating to land between P. and C, in
which there was subsequently a decree directing P. to convey the land
to C upon the payment by the latter of the balance of the purchasemoney, P. conveyed to other parties; therefore C brought smt for the
land against P. and his grantees, who were in possession: Held, that P.
was not a necessary party, and it was not error to allow plaintiff to enter
a non suit as to P., the grantor of the other defendants. Carr v. Alex
ander, 112 N. C, 783.
Page 97. Enforcement of mechanics lien. —The principal contrac
tor is a necessary party to an action to enforce the lien of a sub-contrac
tor, but a trustee in a conveyance, subject to the lien, is not an essential
party. Lumber Co. v. Hotel Co., 109 N. C, 658.
.Sec. 187, page 101. Joint contracts. —The fact that the assets of a
partnership are not sufficient to pay the partnership debts, or ihat a
receiver has charge of the assets, or that, there being many creditors, a
multiplicity of smts may ensue, cannot deprive a creditor of his right to
enforce his claim against any one, or several, or all of the partners.
Hanstein v. Johnson, 112 N. C, 254.
Sec. 188 (1), page 103. Transfer of interest, pendente lite.—In an
action to recover land, a purchaser, after the commencement of the
action, may be substituted as party. Talbert v. Becton, 11 1 N. C. 543.
Page 103. If cause of action survive, abatement only on motion. —
Where two of several plaintiffs died and, there being no personal repre
sentative within a year thereafter, no motion was made to continue the
action as to them, but the cause remained upon the docket and was pro
ceeded with by the remaining plaintiffs, whose rights were finally deter
mined, and the defendants did not apply to have the action abated as to
the deceased parties, it was within the discretion of the presiding Judge
to allow the personal representative of such deceased parties to file a
supplementary complaint and prosecute the action, his motion to be
allowed to do so having been made before the final judgment was ren
dered in the cause. Coggins v. Flythe, 114 N. C, 275.
Sec. 191 (1),page 109. This section applicable only to the Superior
Court. —This section applies to those actions of which the Superior Court
has jurisdiction; it does not embrace those within the jurisdiction of Jus
tices of the Peace. Fisher v. Bullard, 109 N. C, 574.
.Sec. 192, page 110. Residence of domestic corporations. —A domestic
corporation has no residence, within the meaning of this section, and an
action may therefore be brought against it by a non-resident plaintiff in
any county in the State. Kline v. Manufacturing Co., 116 N. C
Page 110. Residence of officers of corporation. —The residences of
officers and directors of a corporation cannot be imputed to the corpora
tion. Kline v. Bryson City Manufacturing Co., 116 N. C
Sec. 194, page 111. Removal to Federal Court properly refused. —
Where it appears upon the face of a petition to remove a cause pending
in a State Court to the Federal Court that the former had exclusive origi
nal jurisdiction, it is the right and the duty of the State Court to insist
upon its exclusive authority and to retain jurisdiction. Tucker v. Life
Association, 112 N. C, 796.
The mere filing of a petition for removal of a suit from the State to the
Federal Court does not work a transfer, but the suit must be one that
may be removed and the petition must show the petitioner's right to
demand a removal. Until these prerequisites appear the State Court is
not ousted of its jurisdiction, and its orders and proceedings must be
respected. Lawson v. Railroad, 112 N. C, 391.
Page 111. Grounds for removal. —In the transfer of causes the
courts look to the real parties in interest, and not to the form of the action.
Tate, Treasurer v. Douglass, 113 N. C, 19a
A suit pending in a court of this State between a citizen of this State
and an alien resident in this State is not removable under the Act of
Congress relating to the removal of causes. Rooker v. Crinkley, 113
N. C, 73.
It is not sufficient ground for removing a cause to the Federal Court
that plaintiffs might have brought separate suits, or omitted certain
defendants, though if they had done so, the cause would properly belong
in said court. Springer v. Sheets, 115 N. C, 371.
Page 111. Motion in State Court. —An application for removal
for diversity of citizenship may be made in the State Court. Williams
v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co. , 1 16 N. C.
Page 111. Motion properly in Federal Court. —A n application for a
removal from a State to a Federal Court on the ground of local preju
dice must be made to the Federal, and not to the State Court. Williams
v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., 116 N. C.
Page 111. When motion should be made. —Where a removal of a
cause from the State to the Federal Court is asked for upon the ground of
prejudice, etc., the order may be granted upon a proper showing, as to
other matters, at any time before trial. Baird v. Railroad, 1 13 N. C., 604.
Where an application for removal for diversity of citizenship is not
made at the term at which the answer in the case should be filed, the
right of removal is forfeited, though it is afterwards made at the time of
filing the answer, which is treated as if filed in proper time. Williams
v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., 116 N. C.
Page 111. Proper procedure in State Court. —A State Court, while
not bound to surrender its jurisdiction on a petition for a removal until
a case has been made, which on its face shows that the petitioner has
the right to transfer, yet, when it does so appear, it is error "to decline
to permit " the removal upon an affidavit offered; therefore, in such case
the usual and proper practice is to enter a formal order that the State
Court will not proceed further, to the end that parties and witnesses may
understand that they will not be required to attend, unless upon notice
that the cause has been remanded. Baird v. Railroad, 113 N. C, 604.
It is not error in the State Court to refuse to order a record to be cer
tified to the Federal Court, since it is the duty of the Clerk to certify it
to the Federal Court in obedience to a writ of certiorari, without any
motion or order made in his own Court, but after the record has been
certified, showing sufficient ground for removal, it is error in the State
Court to resist the order of removal. Baird v. Railroad, 113 N. C, 
Sec. 196, page 114. Finding* of fact conclusive.—The finding of
facts by a trial court upon a motion to remove is conclusive, and the
ruling of the Court therenpon is not reviewable, Albertson v. Terry,
109 N. C, 8.
Sec. 198, page 116, Failure to docket transcript on removal. —Where
a defendant obtaining a change of venue fails to docket the transcript
before the next term of the county to which transfer is made, the order
is properly stricken out by the court granting i'. Kline v. Manufactur
ing Co., 116 N. C; Fisher v. Mining Co., 105 N. C, 123.
Sec. 199, page 116. Summons, when issued. —Summons is issued
only after it has passed from the hands of the Clerk to be given to the
Sheriff for service. If merely filled up and held by the Clerk till prose
cution bond is given, it is not issued. Webster v. Sharpe, 1 16 N. C
Sec. 200, page 119. Amending return. —Where a summons was
properly served and the Sheriff s return was unsigned, though endorsed
in proper form, the Judge at the trial did not exceed his powers in per
mitting the Sheriff to sign the return nunc pro tunc. Luttrell v. Martin,
112N. C,593.
Page 119. Keturn of summons. —The return of the summons
cannot be rebutted by showing, in a collateral proceeding, that in fact
no such service was made. Even if the service of the summons had been
apparently irregular, the judgment could not be collaterally attacked.
Isley v. Boon, 113 N. C, 249.
Sec. 209, page 124. Liability of surety. —The surety is not liable
on the prosecution bond where plaintiff obtained judgment for a certain
amount and costs, though the case having been retained for future dis
position of the counter-claim, such claim was compromised, and an
agreement made that plaintiff pay costs. Smith v. Arthur, 116 N. C
Page 124. Too late to object. —An objection to a prosecution
bond, made after the jury has been empaneled, comes too late. Albertson v. Terry, 109 N. C, 8.
Sec. 212, page 126.
Amended by inserting after the word "costs," in the
third line, the words "except in case of recovery." Acts
1895, ch. 149.
Sec. 214, page 126. Irregularity of service waived. —Irregularity of
service is waived by appearance and plea in bar; therefore, although a
summons issued by one justice cannot be made returnable before another,
except in cases provided by statute to that effect, yet, if the person served
with process so issued appear and, instead of moving to dismiss, enter a
plea in bar, he will be deemed to have waived the objection. Cherry v.
Lilly, 113 N. C, 26; McMinn v. Hamilton, 77 N. C, 300; Morgan v. Bank,
93 N. C, 352.
Page 126. Appearance of counsel. —In a suit, of the subject mat
ter of which a court has jurisdiction, appearance by counsel gives juris
diction of the parties thus appearing, though counsel has no authority
to appear, and an innocent purchaser under a judgment rendered therein
will be protected. Hackett v. McMillan, 112 N. C, 513.
Sec, 216 (1), page 129. Service on local agent of receivers. — An action
against the receivers of a corporation is, in fact, an action against the
corporation. Hence, service of summons on a local agent is service on
the receivers. Farris v. Railroad Co., 115 N. C, 600; Grady v. Railroad,
116 N.C
Page 129. Copy should be served on corporation. —To make service
of process on a corporation, a copy of the same must be left with the
officer of the company to whom it is delivered or read, as provided by
this section for Superior Court, and 840 (Rule XV.) of The Code for Jus
tices' Courts. Aaron v. Lumber Co., 112 N. C, 189.
Sec. 218, page 131. Amendment of affidavit. —Where the affidavit
for publication of summons was defective, it was proper for the Judge to
permit amendment and grant an alias order of publication instead of
dismissing the action. Mullen v. Canal Co., 112 N. C, 109.
Sec. 218 (2), page 131.
At end of sub-section strike out the words "with a like
intent." Acts 1895, ch. 334,
.Sec. 218 (3). page 132. Requisites of affidavit.—It is essential to the
validity of service of summons by publication that the affidavit upon
which the order is to be based should set forth the facts upon which the
alleged cause of action is founded, as well us those which disclose the
necessity that the non-resident defendant should be made a party, with
sufficient particularity to enable the Court to see and determine that there
is a sufficient cause of action and that the defendant is a necessary party.
Bacon v. Johnson, 11o N. C, 114.
When the purpose is to allege a cause of action against a non-resident,
it is necessary to set forth in the affidavit that he has property in the
State. Bacon v. Johnson, 110N. C, 114. And also how the indebted
ness arose. Sheldon v. Kivett, 110 N. C, 408.

Sec. 218 (8), page 134. Mailing process optional. —The method of
mailing process to the Sheriff of the county and State where a non-resi
dent defendant resides, to be served uoon him (as provided by Chapter
120, Acts of 1891) is optional and not exclusive of service by publicatiou
in cases in which this last is proper. Mullen v. Canal Company, 114
N. C, 8.
Page 134. Must be based on attachment of property. —Where an
action is for the recovery of a debt and there is no attachment of the
property to confer jurisdiction there can be no service by publication of
the summons and, hence, actual service in another State "in lien of
publication " would be invalid. Long v. Insurance Co., 114 N. C, 466.
Page 134. Restricted to proceedings in rem. —Service of process
mailed can only be made in those cases where publication could be
made,'to-wit, in actions which are virtually proceedings in rem or quasi
in rem, and in which the jurisdiction as to non-residents only authorizes a
judgment acting upon the property. Long v. Insurace Co., 114 N. C, 466.
Sec. 219, page 135. Sufficient publication. —It is sufficient if the
publication contains the substantial elements of the summons, and the
fact that it is not a literal copy will not render the service void.
Sec. 220, page 135. Court should And the facts.—Where the Court,
in refusing to set aside a judgment by default rendered upon service by
publication, stated in its ruling that "no just or reasonable cause has
been shown why said judgment should be set aside," it should have
found the facts, in order that the correctness of this conclusion might be
reviewed upon appeal. Bacon v. Johnson, 110 N. C, 114.
Sec. 22S, page 137. Notice from referee.—A notice issued by a
referee appointed to state an administrator's account, and served upon
a surety on the administrator's bond to appear before him, no order
having been made to make such surety a party, was not legal process
effective to bring him into Court, or to arrest the running of the statute
of limitations. Koonce v. Pelletier, 115 N. C, 234.
Sec. 228 (1), page 139. Amendment of return. —A Sheriff may
amend his return of process so as to make it speak correctly, even after
suit brought for the penalty imposed for a false return, and such amend
ment defeats the plaintiff's right to recover such penalty. Stealman v.
Greenwood, 113 N. C, 355; Finley v. Hayes, 81 N. C, 368; Hassell v.
Latham, 52 N. C, 465; Patton v. Marr, 44 N. C, 377; Peebles v. Newsome, 74 N. C, 473.
Sec. 229, page 142. Pending action sufficient lis pendens. —Under this
section it is unnecessary to file a separate and formal notice of lis pendens
when the action affecting the title to land is pending in the county
where the land is situated, provided the pleadings contain the names of
the parties, the object of the action and a description of the land to be
affected. Arrington v. Arrington, 114 N. C, 151.
Page 142. Removal of pleadings to another county. —Although,
where a suit affecting title to real estate is prosecuted with diligence,
the lis pendens continues until final judgment, or until cancelled under
the direction of the Court, and no loss or destruction of the notice will
affect its efficiency, yet where the suit is transferred, by consent, to
another county on the original papers, instead of a transcript being sent
as was proper, and nothing is left on the files to inform a purchaser of
the nature of the action and the property to be affected by it, the lis
pendens fails and a boua fide purchaser will be protected. Arrington v.
Arrington, 114 N. C, 152.
Page 142. Sufficient description of property. —Where the designa
tion of land in the pleadings is so definite that any one by reading it
can learn thereby, either by description or reference, what property is
intended to be made the subject of litigation, it is a sufficient lis pendens.
Arrington v. Arrington, 114 N. C, 151.
Sec. 232, page 145. Immaterial variance between summons and com
plaint. —Where a summons was issued in the name of plaintiff, "Dennis
Bnrrell," and the amended complaint declared in the name of the
" State on the relation of Dennis Burrell," the discrepancy is not mate
rial. State ex rel v. Hughes, 116 N. C; Jackson v. Maultsby, 78 N.
C, 174; Warrenton v. Arrington, 101 N. C, 112.
Page 145. Complaint need not itemize an account. —In an action
on a contract for sawing timber, it is not necessary to set out the items
in the pleadings, section 591 of The Code being applicable only to actions
brought under the "book-debt law." McPhail v. Johnson, 115 N. C, 299.
Note. —But the itemized account should be filed as an " exhibit "
attached to the complaint, otherwise the defendant can move for it to
be furnished him. The Code, \ 259.
Page 145. Sufficient allegation of negligence. —An allegation in a
complaint that the defendant negligently permitted fires to be commu
nicated from their engines or property to the lands adjoining their rail
road, or right-of-way, by which said Are, the spread and extension
thereof, plaintiff's turpentine was burned and destroyed, is a sufficient
allegation of negligence on the part of the defendant resulting in dam
age to the plaintiff. Black v. Railroad Company, 115 N. C, 667.
Page 145, Complaint alleging quantum meruit.—Where the com
plaint is broad enough to set out an action on a quantum meruit, the
plaintiff will not be confined to the express contract, and if not broad

seduction. —When the complaint in setting forth a breach of promise to
marry shows facts sufficient to make out a case of seduction, the action
may be treated as one for seduction. Hood v. Sudderth, m N. C, 215.
Sec. 233 (2), page 146. Complaint should contain.—Under The Code,
as well as at common law, the facts constituting a cause of action or
defence must be plainly set forth in the pleadings. Lassiter v. Roper,
114 N. C, 17; Rountree v. Robinson, 98 N. C, 107.

that a copy of a telegraph message is attached, which copy has the mes
sage written upon a blank printed form containing certain conditions,
such blank with the message and conditions thereon forms a part of the
complaint. Sherrill v. Telegraph Company, 109 N. C, 527.

not be pleaded specially to show title. Asbury v. Fair, 111 N. C, 251.
Page 148. In an action for malicious abuse of process. —In an action
to recover damages for the malicious abuse of process in a civil action,
it is not necessary that the complaint shall aver a judicial determination
of the action in which such process issued. It is otherwise in actions
for malicious prosecutions for crime. Sneeden v. Harris, 109 N. C, 349.
Sec. 233 (3), page 150. Pacts, not prayer, governs relief. —The facts
stated, and not the prayer for relief, show what remedy ought to be
granted. Johnson v. Loftin, in N. C, 319.
Sec. 237f page 155. Surety not released. —Where one administrator,
without the knowledge or consent of his coadministrator, agreed to com
promise a suit for the possession of land and foreclosure of a mortgage,
wherein R. had become surety on an undertaking given by the mortgagor
under this section to secure the rents, etc., which agreement included
an indulgence for a definite time, but no positive act of affirmation or
adoption by the co-administrator of the agreement was shown, the surety
is not released. Jordan v. Spiers, 113 N. C, 344.
Page 155. ffotice to strike ont for want of bond. —Where the de
fendant in a petition for partition pleaded sole seizin, it was error to
strike out his answer without notice, because no defence bond had been
filed. He was entitled to a rule to show cause. Cooper v. Warlick, 109
N. C, 672; Brittain v. Howell, 19 N. C, 107; Russell v. Saunders, 48
N. C, 432.
Sec. 238, page 150. Statute of frauds. —A defendant cannot take
advantage of the statute of frauds respecting a verbal contract to convey
land by demurrer, because such contract is not void, but only voidable
when the statute is pleaded, and by demurrer the defendant elects to
treat it as still subsisting. Loughran v. Giles, 110 N. C, 423.
Page 150. Demand and refusal. —Where, in an action by a prin
cipal against an agent for money due by the latter, the complaint does
not allege a demand and refusal, a demurrer on that ground will not lie
when in the answer, which contains the demurrer, a general denial of
indebtedness is made and the statute of limitations pleaded. Lamb v.
Ward, 114 N. C, 255.
Page 156. Demurrer to evidence.— If a party demurs to the evi
dence introduced by his antagonist, he admits the truth of it with such
inferences as may be reasonably drawn therefrom. Hopkins v. Bowers,
in N. C, 175; Bond v. Wool, 107 N. C, 139; Nelson v. Whitfield, 82
N. C, 46.

Sec. 239, page 158, That negligence is not sufficiently charged. —A
demurrer "that the negligence complained of is not sufficiently and
legally set out," is sufficient. Conley v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 692.
Sec. 239 (1), page 159. Removal of cloud on title. —An action to
remove a cloud upon title cannot be maintained unless it affirmatively
appears that the plaintiff is rightfully in possession. McNamee v. Alex
ander, 109 N. C, 242; Peacock v. Stott, 104 N. C, 154. [Otherwise now
under Act 1893, ch. 6. Mortgage Co. v. Long, 113 N. C, 123.]
Page 159. Jurisdiction on claim and delivery. —The Superior Court
has jurisdiction of an action not based on contract, but for the recovery
of property alleged to exceed fifty dollars in value; and if the value is
less than fifty dollars, the Superior Court has concurrent jurisdiction
with a Justice of the Peace. (The Code, sec. 887.) Crinkley v. Egerton,
113 N. C, 142.
Page 160. Jurisdiction of open account. —On who has an account
against another consisting of several distinct items based on separate
transactions may bring an action upon each distinct and separate item;
but if he should bring more actions than are necessary in order to avail
himself of the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace, the Court may, to
prevent oppression and unnecessary costs, require a consolidation of the
actions. If, before action brought, the plaintiff renders a statement cov
ering all, the items contracted at different dates, to which no objection
is made by the debtor within a reasonable time, the account becomes an
account stated, and cannot be then split up. Simpson v. Elwood, 114
N. C, 528; Hawkins v. Long, 74 N. C, 781.
Sec. 239 (2), page 100. Legal incapacity waived. —Where, in an
action by an infant in his own name against defendant for services ren
dered, the defendant relied upon a general denial of the indebtedness as
his sole defence, thereby
sue, a motion to dismiss the action after the testimony was all in is too
late to be entertained. Hicks v. Beam, 112 N. C, 642.
Sec. 239 (3), page 161. Between same parties for same cause.—The
rule governing the plea of the pendency of another action is that the
same plaintiff shall not sue the same defendant twice for the same thing;
and when the parties are the same and the thing sued for is the same,
the right shown in both actions must be identical. Propst v. Mathis,
US N. C, 526; Curtis v. Piedmont Co., 109 N. C, 401.
An action against a receiver for failure to collect a judgment out of
certain bonds and other property alleged to have belonged to the judg
ment debtor is not barred by a judgment in a former action by plaintiff,
to which the receiver was not a party, in which it was adjudged that the
debtor was not the owner of the bonds, and in which the other property
was not involved. Turner v. Rosenthal, 116 N. C.
Sec. 239 (4), page 161. Misjoinder of unnecessary parties. —The mis
joinder of unnecessary parties is mere surplusage under The Code, and
not grouud of demurrer. McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. C, 578; Wool v.
Edenton, 113 N. C, 33; Burns v. Ashworth, 72 N. C, 496.
The misjoinder of parties is a mere matter of surplusage under The
Code, and not a fatal objection; and, therefore, the fact that the State
of North Carolina is joined with the Treasurer of the State as a relator
in an action in the name of the United States against the sureties on the
bond of a receiver appointed by the United States Circuit Court, cannot
affect the action. Tate, Treasurer, v. Douglass, 113 N. C, 191.
Page 161. Objection to defect of parties taken by demurrer. —
Where defendant did not demur, on the ground that a proper party
defendant was not joined, an objection by defendant on that ground will
not be sustained. Machine Co. v. Lumber Co., 109 N. C, 576.
Page 162. Demurrer must be filed before defect cured. —Where the
petition in a proceeding for assessment of damages for the right-of-way
of a railroad enumerates the various owners of the land, and such owners
voluntarily came in and made themselves parties, a demurrer by the
defendant company that there was a defect of parties when the petition
was first filed is untenable. Hill v. Mining Co., 113 N. C, 259.
Sec. 239(5), page 164. Action by trustee.—The fact that the money
for which an action is brought by a trustee belongs to different persons
does not involve a misjoinder of causes of action. Peebles v. Boone,
116 N.C.
Page 164. Causes of actions properly joined.. —Where a party had
obtained, on appeal, an affirmance of a judgment establishing his sub
contractor's lien against the owner of a building, but the cause was
remanded for the reason that the contractor was not a party, and the
plaintiff thereupon brought another action, in which the contractor was
made a party defendant: Held, that the two actions were properly con
solidated by the Court below. Lumber Co. v. Sanford, 112 N. C, 655;
Hartman v. Spiers, 87 N. C, 28.
Where there are mortgages upon land in this State held by non-resi
dent mortgagees, and a subsequent trust deed affecting part of the same
land, the trustee and one cestui que trust being resident in this State, and
another cestui que trust being resident of another State, the mortgagor
and trustor (being resident in this State) can bring and maintain in the
State Courts (i) an action against the trustee and the cestuis que trusteni,
asking for an adjudication of the amount due on the claims and a sale
to satisfy them, and pay over to the plaintiff any balance due him, thus
treating the older mortgages as satisfied; or (2) an action against the first
mortgagees for a settlement and cancellation of the mortgages; or (3) a combined action against all the parties for foreclosure of the trust deed
and cancellation of the mortgages. Springer v. Sheets, 115 N. C, 370.
Page 164. Causes of action improperly joined. —A special proceed
ing by a trustee of a religious society, in which he demanded judgment
that certain other trustees should be removed, and that a lost deed should
be set up and a trust therein declared, is demurrable for misjoinder of
causes of action. Nash v. Sutton, 109 N. C, 550.
Page 165. Motion to divide too late. —Where the judgment of a
Clerk sustaining a demurrer for misjoinder and dismissing a complaint,
in special proceedings before him, is affirmed on appeal to the Judge,
and an appeal from the judgment of affirmance is not perfected, a sub
sequent motion to divide the action is properly overruled, as the matters
involved are res judicata. Langston v. Weil, 116 N. C
Sec. 239 {6), page 166. Demurrer by part of defendants. —When
there are several defendants, and the complaint sets up a good cause of
action as to any one of them, a joint demurrer will be overruled; and
where several defendants are joined with the party to the verbal agree
ment as to real estate, they cannot demur for insufficiency of cause of
action until the latter makes his election to ratify or repudiate the con
tract, but he cannot make an election to the prejudice of persons whose
rights have intervened. Loughran v. Giles, 110 N. C, 423.
Page 166. Complaints stating sufficient cause of action. —It is not
necessary that the petition filed by a land-owner, in proceedings for the
assessment of damages for land taken by a railroad company for rightof-way, shall state that the petitioners and the company have failed to
come to an agreement as to the sum to be paid, such averment being
necessary only when the railroad company is the actor in such proceed
ings. Hill v. Mining Co., 113 N. C, 259.
An allegation in a complaint that defendant loan association knew
that the only inducement to the payment of money and subscribing for
stock was the promised loan, and that defendant accepted the money
with such knowledge, was a sufficient statement of a cause of action,
although it was not alleged that the agent of the defendant who made
the alleged promises had authority to make them. Fagg v. Loan Asso
ciation, 113 N. C, 364.
Where a complaint alleged that the plaintiff, being the owner of a
license to build and operate a street railway, assigned it in escrow to M.,
who, in breach of the trust reposed in him, assigned it to defendant cor
poration, who is endeavoring to act under it, and plaintiff seeks to have
the assignment set aside and the defendant enjoined from operating the
road: Held, that it was error to dismiss the action on the ground that
the complaint did not set out a cause of action. Atkinson v. Railway
Co., 113 N. C, 582.
Page 169. Complaints not stating sufficient cause of action. —The
complaint alleged that plaintiff had, at the dying request of her sister,
taken charge of and supported, by her own unaided labors, an infant
child of the sister; that the father of the child, at that time, was, and
since has remained, insane, and has been continously an inmate of the
State Asylum; that he was possessed of an estate about the value of
$6,000, now under the control of his guardian, and prayed judgment for
compensation for the support of the infant: Held, upon demurrer, that
the conplaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,
for that it did not allege any contract, express or implied, with the father,
and that it appeared that the support of the infant was voluntarily
assumed by plaintiff. Everitt v. Walker, 109 N. C, 129.
An allegation in the complaint for falsely and maliciously suing out
process in a civil action, that one of the defendants, at the request of
the others, executed as surety an undertaking upon an order for the
arrest of plaintiff, but which fails to show any other ground of action
against him, does not state a sufficient cause of action against such
defendant. Sneeden v. Harris, 109 N. C, 349.
A complaint which states that the plaintiff is the equitable owner of
land, but sets forth no facts in support of the equitable title, except that
plaintiff has a bond for title from a third party, does not state a cause of
action, and the action will be dismissed in the Supreme Court, upon
motion. Leatherwood v. Fulbright, 109 N. C, 683.
A complaint in an action for wrongful death is fatally defective which
alleges that plaintiff "was, by the wrongful act, neglect and default of
the defendant, slain and killed," in that the facts constituting the alleged
negligence are not set out. Conley v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 692.
Where a complaint against a telegraph company charges defendant
with specific instances of unnecessary delay in transmitting and deliver
ing messages, but alleges no violation of the regulations of the Commis
sion prescribing the rates of charges for messages, it states no cause of
action under the act. Mayo v. Telegraph Co., 112 N. C, 343.
The contract alleged in this case is held too vague and indefinite to
sustain an action. Nash v. Ferrabow, 115 N. C, 303.
A petition alleging that the assignee of an insolvent debtor, while
carrying on the business of the assignor under an agreement with the
defendants and other creditors of such assignor, and for their benefit,
became indebted to plaintiffs, and that all matters between such assignee
and creditors relative to the assigned estate had been submitted to arbi
tration under an agreement not alleged to have been signed by plaintiffs,
and the resulting award found the assigned estate indebted to plaintiffs
in the sum sued for, does not state a cause of action against defendants.
Webb v. Hicks, 116 N. C.
Sec. 240, page 170. Demurrer must be special. —A motion to dismiss
an action because the complaint does not state facts sufficient to consti
tute a cause of action is a demurrer, and should be disregarded unless it
specify the particulars of the allege' defect. The objection may be taken
ore ienus for the first time in the Supreme Court, or the Court may, ex
mero moiu, dismiss the cause; but if a motion is made by a party to dis
miss, he will be required to specify the grounds. Elam v. Barnes, 110
N. C, 73Sec 241, page 170. Defect not appearing on complaint. —Where a
defect of parties appears on the face of the complaint, it should be taken
advantage of by demurrer. If such defect does not so appear, the defend
ant, in his answer, should set out the names of those who are necessary
parties, to the end, in either case, that the Court, being thus informed,
may decide, before the trial of the issues of fact or law, that all neces
sary parties are present. Johnson v. Gooch, 114 N. C, 62.
Sec. 242, page 172. Waiver of objection. —Where an infant, with
out the intervention of a guardian or next friend, undertakes to prose
cute his suit in his own name, the debtor has a right to object to his
recovery, since the infant may repudiate the judgment if rendered before
his Majority, but such objection must be interposed in apt time and in
the prescribed mode, which is by plea in abatement or by defence set up
in the answer and before the trial on the merits. Hicks v. Beam, 112
N. C, 642.
Sec. 243 (1), page 174. Immaterial allegations.—The plaintiff hav
ing caused the wife of the judgment creditor to be made a party defend
ant for the purpose of enabling her to assert any rights she might have,
she filed an answer which tended to revive issues which had been finally
adjudicated between plaintiff and her husband instead of setting up any
rights of her own: Held, that such answer was immaterial and was prop
erly disregarded by the Judge below. Vanstory v. Thornton, 114 N. C.,
375Page 174. Equitable defence.—An equitable defenc; must be set
up by proper pleading to be available. Talbert v. Becton, in N. C, 543;
Cotton Mills v. Cotton Mills, 116 N. C. See ? 243 (2).
Page 174. When answer should be filed. —Where, in an action be
gun by summons returnable to fall term of a Superior Court, at which
term the complaint was filed, and an alias summons returnable to spring
term was served in due time on one of the defendants, such defendant
was properly ruled to answer at that term. Luttrell v. Martin, 112
N. C., 594Page 175. Insufficient denial.—Plaintiff having set out in the
complaint the contract sued upon, the defendant, in answer thereto,
stated that be did sign a paper similar to that stated in the complaint,
but there was no consideration: Held, that this was not sufficient to raise
an issue as to the execution of the instrument, but, in effect, was an
admission of that fact, and dispensed with further proof. Hargrove v.
Adcock, in N. C, 166.
A denial, in an answer, of knowledge on the part of defendant of an
allegation of a complaint, is incomplete unless it includes a denial of
information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation.
Fagg v. Loan Association, 113 N. C, 364.
Sec. 243 (it), page 177. Equitable defences.—The defendant need
not set out formally the facts relied upon to show its right to equitable
relief, if such right can be gathered from the whole answer. Cotton
Mills v. Cotton Mills, 116 N. C. But it must be set up by the answer.
Talbert v. Becton, 111 N. C, 543.
Page 178. Contract of corporation not In writing. —A defendant
cannot avail itself of Section 683 of The Code unless it had been spe
cifically pleaded. Cozart v. Land Co., 113 N. C, 294.
Note. —The Code, sec. 683, was repealed. Acts 1893, ch. 84.
Sec. 244 (1), page 180. Counter-claim properly pleaded.—Where the
demand of the defendant arose out of the contract, it is properly set up
by counter-claim. Brown v. Carter, in N. C, 183.
Page 180. Nonsuit. — In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the
defence was set up that the transaction was fraudulent, having been
entered into by the parties (brothers) for the purpose of defrauding the
mortgagor's creditors. On the trial the plaintiff asked to be allowed to
take a nonsuit, but that was denied and the trial ordered to proceed: Held,
that the parties being particeps criminis to the fraud, there was no such
counter-claim set up in the pleadings as the law would recognize; that
the courts would not aid either party, and there was error in refusing to
allow the plaintiff to abandon his action. Pass v. Pass, 109 N. C, 484.
Where the defendant, in an action to recover land, sets up a counter
claim for substantive relief, the plaintiff is not entitled to take a nonsuit.
Wilkins v. Suttles, 114 N. C, 551.
Page 181. Counter-claim in actions for tort A party cannot set
up, as a counter-claim to an action for tort, matters which arise out of
a contract unconnected with the transaction sued on. Smith v. Young,
109 N. C, 224.
One who, in the honest belief that he is on his own land, cuts logs
from the land of another, cannot, when they are recaptured by the law
ful owner, set up a claim for their increase in value by reason of his
having transported them to a better market; nor can he, in an action
by the lawful owner for damages for cutting other logs, recoup by way
of counter-claim for the additional value imparted by him to the logs so
recaptured. Gaskins v. Davis, 115 N. C, 86.
Where, in an action for damages caused by the ponding of water on
plaintiff's land by obstruction placed by defendant on his own land, on
or near the dividing line, the defendant pleaded as a counter-claim
damages caused by the overflow of water on his land by reason of
obstructions placed by the plaintiff on the lower edge of her land: Held,
that the torts were separate and distinct, and that complained of by the
defendant did not "arise out of the transaction set forth in the com
plaint," nor was it "connected with the subject matter of the action,"
and hence was properly disallowed as a counter-claim. Street v. An
drews, 115 N. C, 417.
Page 182. Unavailable as counter-claim. —A counter-claim against
persons other than plaintiffs for a tort not connected with the subject of
the action will not be allowed. Thomson-Houston Co. v. Henderson Co.,
116 N. C
Page 182. Waiver of objection to counter-claim. —Although a coun
ter-claim set up in an answer and admitted therein to be the subject of
another action pending between the parties will be abated upon the
objection of the plaintiff by a proper pleading, yet such objection, if
waived, cannot afterward avail the plaintiff. Davis v. Terry, 114 N. C, 28.
Page 182. Defect in article bought. —In an action upon a promis
sory note given in pursuance of a contract for the sale by payee of a
specific article of merchandise, the maker may set up, by way of coun
ter-claim, that the article furnished was not in compliance with the con
tract of sale, and that he was thereby damaged. Guano Co. v. Tillery,
11o N. C, 29.
Page 183. Fraud a valid counter-claim. —Defendant having made
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, plaintiff, through its attorney,
who was also acting as trustee under the deed of assignment, split up
its account against the insolvent corporation so as to bring it within the
jurisdiction of a Justice's Court, and obtained judgments thereon, defend
ant making no defence thereto by reason of representations made to it
by such trustee: Held, that in its answer to a creditor's bill brought by
plaintiff, defendant could, by counter-claim, impeach such judgments
for fraud, and demand that they be vacated. Cotton Mills v. Cotton
Mills, 116 N. C
Page 183. Counter-claim Insufficiently pleaded.—A counter-claim
for damages for the malicious prosecution of a prior action, which fails to
allege facts showing that the prosecution of such prior action was with
out probable cause, is bad. Davis v. Terry, 114 N. C, 28.
Sec. 244 (2). page 184. Counter-claim must exist when action
brought. —Where it appeared that during the pendency of an action of
claim and delivery to recover a soda-water machine leased to defendant,
plaintiff had agreed to deliver a new machine to defendant and take
back the one in controversy at a certain value: Held, that the agreement
being executory, and not executed, did not bar the further prosecution
of the action, and its breach by the plaintiff did not furnish ground for
a proper counter-claim, since it did not exist at the commencement of
the action. Puffer v. Lucas, 112 N. C, 377.
Page 185. Damages. —Damages for slander cannot be set up as
a counter-claim to an action for debt. Milling Co. v. Finlay, 110 N. C,

takes it subject to all the equities between the parties thereto, whether
he had notice of them or not. Rice v. Hearn, 109 N. C, 150.
Page 186. Allegation not constituting counter-claim. —An allega
tion in an answer that the property, for the recovery of which the suit
is brought, belonged to plaintiff and defendant as partners, does not
constitute a counter-claim. Buffkin v. Eason, 11o N. C, 264.
Page 186. After assignment of notes and bonds. —Where the com
plaint in an action by the endorsee of a note does not state that the
laintiff purchased the note for value and before maturity, an answer
y the defendant that the execution of the note by him was procured by
the fraud of the payee, puts upon the plaintiff the burden of proof to
establish the fact that he was the purchaser for value, and before matu
rity, and without notice of the alleged fraud. Campbell v. Patton, 113
N. C, 481.
A purchaser of several notes for value and before maturity, without
notice of any set-offs, who pays one-half of their aggregate face value,
and gives the endorsee credit for the balance, subject to his check, holds
all the notes free from any right of set-off in favor of the maker as to
any balance unpaid, and the fact that he may have recovered on part
of the notes does not deprive him of the character of a purchaser for
value, so as to let in the right of set-off as to the others. Bank v. McNair,
116 N.C
Page 186. Assignment of claim after appointment of receiver. —After
the appointment of a receiver a creditor may assign his claim, but such
assignment is subject to the receiver's right to set-off claims the bank
may have against the creditor, and if the assignee of the claim is himself
a debtor of the bank, he cannot use the assigned claim as a set-off. Davis
v. Manufacturing Co., 114 N. C, 322.
Page 186. Between endorsee and maker. —That an endorsee who
rediscounts notes, may have paid less than their face value for them,
does not entitle the maker to any right of set-off to which he would not
otherwise be entitled. Bank v. McNair, 116 N. C
Page 186. Action by one partner. —A bank may recover from
any partner the overdraft of the partnership in an independent action,
or may plead it as a counterclaim in a suit by such partner to recover
his individual deposit. Adams v. Bank, 113 N. C, 332.
Page 187. In equitable action.—In an equitable action for the
settlement of the estate of a deceased administrator, and to satisfy a
judgment obtained in another State against his personal representatives
and the sureties on his bond, such sureties may intervene and receive
credit for what they have paid on the judgment, remaining liable to
plaintiffs for any balance not realized in the present action. Moore v.
Smith, 116 N. C
Page 187. Set-off. —The right of set-off only exists between the
same parties and in the same right. Adams v. Bank, 113 N. C, 332.
Sec. 2.47, page 189. Hot frivolous. —An answer to a complaint in
an action on a note cannot be said to be frivolous which formally denies
that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of the note, and thus puts
plaintiff to proof of that fact. Bank v. Atkinson, 113 N. C, 47S.
Although an answer to a complaint in an action on a note does not
set out the allegations of fraud with the particularity that the rules of
pleading ordinarily require, yet, if it seems intended to raise a serious
question of fraud, it will not be stricken out as frivolous, for, if filed in
good faith, the defendant is entitled to have the facts alleged in it either
admitted by demurrer or tried by a jurv. Campbell v. Patton, 113 N.
C, 481.
Sec. 248, page 191. Denial of counterclaim sufficient. —An answer
having alleged a set-off, the replication thereto alleged that such answer
is " untrue and denied," and reiterated the cause of action stated in the
complaint: Held, sufficient to put the plea of set-off in issue and require
evidence in its support. Gregg v. Mallett, III N. C, 74.
Page 192. Replication to plea of statute of limitations, when nec
essary. —Under the present practice, a replication to the plea of the
statute of limitations is necessary only when matter in avoidance is
pleaded. Stubbs v. Motz, 113 N. C, 458.
Sec. 249, page 193. Judgment on counter-claim. —The burden is
upon the plaintiff to establish the facts alleged in the replication, and
upon failure to do so, defendant was entitled to judgment on the coun
ter-claim, and it was error in such case to submit an issue involving the
matter pleaded in the counter-claim. It was not necessary that the
pleadings should be formally introduced in evidence to entitle defendant
to judgment on his counter-claim. Rumbough v. Improvement Co., 109
N. C, 703.
Sec. 255, page 198. Powers of the Judge. —A motion to vacate the
order of sale and to allow the defendants, the intestate's heirs-at-law, to
pay the debts of the estate, was allowed by the Clerk and affirmed, on
appeal, by the Judge, and remanded to the Clerk for the purpose of noti
fying the purchaser to show cause why the sale should not be set aside,
and, after successive references, was finally heard and allowed: Held,
no error. The Judge had power, under Acts of 1887, ch. 276, to deter
mine the whole matter in controversy. Lictie v. Chappell, 11 1 N. C.,347.
Page 199. Amendment in Superior Court. —A Clerk having juris
diction of a petition for partition, the transfer thereof to term for trial
of issues raised by the pleadings transferred the jurisdiction to the Judge,
and the denial by the latter of a motion for leave to amend the petition
upon the ground that he had no power to grant it, was error. Godwin
v. Early, 114 N. C, 11.
If an action, begun wrongfully before the Clerk, gets into the Superior
Court by appeal or otherwise, the latter has jurisdiction, and can make
any needful amendment of process to give effectual jurisdiction, as also
the Supreme Court may do, if necessary. McLean v. Breece, 113 N. C,
391; Cheatham v. Cruise, 81 N. C, 343; Robeson v. Hodges, 105 N. C, 49.
Where there was no error by the Clerk in sustaining the- demurrer for
misjoinder on the ground of want of jurisdiction of one of the causes of
action on the appeal from the Clerk, the plaintiff, on the hearing thereof,
would not be allowed to abandon the causes of action of which the Clerk could not take cognizance, and rely upon that of which he had jurisdic
tion, in order to acquire a status in the Court in term-time. Nash v.
Sutton, 109 N. C, 550.
Sec. 257, page 201. Effect of amended pleading. —Filing an amended
pleading does not exclude the party from the benefit of allegations in
the original pleading. Threadgill v. Commissioners, 116 N. C
Page 201. Right to judgment on verified complaint. —It was error
to refuse the plaintiffs judgment upon failure of defendants to put in a
verified answer to such complaint, unless, for good cause shown, the
defendants were entitled to an extension of time for answer. Griffin v.
Light Co., i11 N. C, 434. See ^385, 386, and notes.
Page 202. Admissions in Pleadings.—The whole admissions in
pleadings must be taken together; therefore, where, in an action on a
note, the plaintiff had offered the first article of defendant's answer
admitting the debt, it was proper to admit as evidence for defendant the
second article of the answer, which was a qualification of the first.
Spencer v. Fortescue, 112 N. C, 269.
Although an admission in the first answer was competent, it was not
conclusive evidence of the indebtedness, when it w&s denied by the
later pleadings, and the jury should pass upon the issue concerning the
same, and upon the evidence of the admission if plaintiff saw fit to offer
it Cummings v. Hoffman, 113 N. C, 267.
Sec. 258, page 203. Verification by attorney or agent. —The pleading
of a non-resident may be verified by an agent or attorney (1) when the
action is upon a written instrument for the payment of money only and
the instrument is in the possession of such agent or attorney ; (2) when
all the material allegations are within the personal knowledge of such
agent or attorney. Griffin v. Light Co., 11 1 N. C, 434.
Page 204. Possession sufficient ground of belief. —The averment of
the possession of the note sued on is allegation of "knowledge or grounds
of belief," for, nothing else appearing, such note, when put in evidence,
would entitle the plaintiff to judgment. Griffin v. Light Co., m N. C,
434Page 204. Verification before Court of Record in another State. —
A verification of pleading made before the Clerk of a Court of Record
in another State, and authenticated by his signature and the seal of his
Court, is valid. Hinton v. Life Ins. Co., 116 N. C
Page 204. Before Notary Public. —A verification was attested
only by a person signing his name with the letters " N P." added
thereto, but without an official seal, is of no effect. Tucker v. Life
Association, 112 N. C, 796.
Page 204. Material amendment. —A material amendment unveri
fied to a verified complaint renders it necessary to treat the complaint as
unverified. Brown v. Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Sec. 25it, page 205. Items of an account. —The items of account
need not be set out in the complaint. McPhail v. Johnson, 115 N. C,
298.
Page 205. Bill of particulars ordered.—When the defendant
makes it appear that he i»at a disadvantage by reason of insufficient
description of his defence, the Court will, in its discretion, order a bill
of particulars to be furnished him. State v. Bryant, m N. C, 693.
Sec. 260, page 205, liberal construction. —A plea that a cause of
action did not "arise" within the time prescribed by the statute for
the commencement of an action, while not strictly accurate, will be
construed under the liberal system of pleading in force under section
260 of The Code, to mean that it did not " accrue " within that time.
Stubbs v. Motz, 113 N. C, 458.
Sec. 201, page 207. Order to make pleadings more definite. —The
motion to make a complaint more definite is addressed to the discretion
of the trial Judge. Conley v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 692.
The Superior Court has a right ex mero tnotu to direct that pleadings
shall be more explicit, as that an entire will, instead of one clause
thereof, shall be set out. Martin v. Goode, m N. C, 288.
Page 207. Aider. — Defective statements of causes of action
and aider by pleading discussed. Conley v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 692.
A general denial by the defendant of the plaintiff's right to recover,
cures the failure of plaintiff to allege a tender before action brought.
Cotton Mills v- Abernathy, 115 N. C, 402.
Page 207. Insufficient pleading.— In an action for divorce a
mensa et thoro, on the ground of personal violence by the husband, ren
dering the life and condition of the wife intolerable and burdensome, it
is essential that the plaintiff shall specifically set forth in her complaint
the circumstances under.which the violence was committed, what her
conduct was, and especially what she had done to provoke such conduct
on the part of her husband. A general allegation that such conduct
was " without cause or provocation on her part," is insufficient. O'Con
nor v. O'Connor, 109 N. C, 139.
It seems that a complaint against a common carrier for personal
injuries should allege a contract of carriage upon a specific day. Con
ley v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 692; see. \ 239 (6) and cases there cited.
Sec. 267, page 21 1. Joinder of causes of action against different par
sons. —A plaintiff in a creditor's bill may join causes of action for the
recovery of an indebtedness not theretofore reduced to judgment: for
the removal of an insolvent trustee ; for the appointment of a receiver ;
to declare a conveyance to the creditor of the principal defendant void,
and that a prior mortgage shall be foreclosed and the surplus money
applied to the debts of other creditors; and persons having an interest
in these several causes of action should be made parties defendant.
LeDuc v. Brandt, 110 N. C, 289.
Though separate suits may be brought against the different lienors,
yet when complete relief cannot be had without the presence of all the
defendants to an action by the mortgagor against the senior and junior
mortgagees for the ascertainment and settlement of the rights of all
parties, there is not a separate controversy. Springer v. Sheets, 115 N.
c, 370.
Where a person was insured in several companies, and each policy
limited the amount of his recovery thereunder to the proportion of the
loss which the policy should bear to the total insurance, it was proper,
in an action to recover for a loss, to make each company a party defend
ant. Pretzfelder v. Merchant s Ins. Co., 116 N. C.

The aggregate sum demanded in good faith is the test of the jurisdic
tion of the Court, though this aggregate is made up of several causes of
action. Martin v. Goode, 111 N. C, 288.
When the complaint alleged a liability of the defendant administra
trix c. t. a., for $150 and interest, balance due on an annuity devised,
and another liability for $359.46, due because of her failure to board her
mother according to the direction of her testator's will, it was Held, that
a demurrer to the jurisdiction was improperly sustained, and this, though
the Court below ruled that the second cause of action could not be
maintained. Martin v; Goode, 11 1 N. C, 28.
Sec. 267 (2), page 212. Penalties. —A person suing one defendant

mere general denial of title in the ancestor, and without alleging inde
pendent title in themselves, put the administrator to proof of the dece
dent's title. Stainback v. Harris, 115 N. C, 100.
An allegation of a conveyance, and that it has been lost or destroyed,
when not denied by the answer, is an admission of the effect of such
conveyance as fully as if produced in evidence. McMillan v. Gambill,
115 N. C, 352.

ter-claim defectively stated may (if it can be maintained at all) be cured
bv a reply which contains the allegations omitted therefrom. Gaskins
v." Davis, 115 N. C, 85.
Page 2 15. Consolidation of actions; effect of denial in one. —Where,
after a specific denial in an answer of the allegation of a complaint, a
subsequent paragraph of the answer, by inadvertence, virtually admitted
such allegations, and in another suit against same defendants by other
parties the answer specifically denied such allegations, and the actions
were, by consent, consolidated, it was error in the Court below to render
judgment for the plaintiff in the first suit upon such inadvertent admis
sion, for whatever question might have arisen on the conflicting plead
ings was obviated by the consolidation of the two actions and the express
denial in the latter suit. Lockhart v. Ballard, 113 N. C, 292.
Page 216. In proceedings for alimony. —In proceedings for ali
mony, allegations in the answer charging the wife with infidelity, which
are too vague to constitute grounds for divorce, are no defence. Cram

the Superior Court is not ousted by failure of proof, or by sustaining a
demurrer as to part, of the demand. Martin v. Goode, 111 N. C, 288.
Sec. 272, page 221. After sustaining demurrer. —A ruling in the
Supreme Court, on a former appeal, that the lower Court ought to have
sustained a demurrer to one of the causes of action set up in the com
plaint, did not warrant that Court in excluding evidence on such cause
of action as res judicata, but it should have entered judgment sustaining
the demurrer, and then, in its discretion, might have permitted the plain
tiff to amend. Maggett v. Roberts, 112 N. C, 71.
It is solely within the discretion of the Judge below to allow an amend
ment to a complaint after a demurrer thereto has been sustained. Barnes
v. Crawford, 115 N. C, 76.
Sec. 273? page 223. Amendment adding defence accruing since action
began. —While a plaintiff cannot recover upon a title accruing after the
commencement of an action to recover land, a defendant will be per
mitted by an amendment to his answer in the nature of a plea since last
continuance to plead defects in the plaintiff's title, or matter validating
his own, which accrued since the action began. Taylor v. Gooch, 11o

of the pleadings 0n the trial when such amendment does not change the
character of the action. Allen v. McLendon, 113 N. C, 322.
Page 223. Amendment of summons. —Although a summons be
informal in some respects, or even defective in failing to contain every
thing requisite under the statute, yet, if it bears internal evidence of its
official origin and of the purpose for which it was issued, its informality
and defects may be cured by amendment. Redmond v. Mullenax, 113
N. C, 505.
Where an action was brought on the official bond of the Clerk of the
Superior Court in the name of the parties injured by a breach thereof,
it was not error in the Court below to permit an amendment of the sum
mons by the insertion of the words "The State on relation of," after
the pleadings were filed. Forte v. Boone, 114 N. C, 176.
Page 223. Amendment presumed regularly made.—Where the
record on appeal shows that a complaint was amended, and it is sug
gested by counsel in this Court that the amendment was made without
his knowledge, and that no order for it appears in the record, it will be
presumed that it was regularly allowed below, though, in case of inad
vertence, the amendment could be made here. Monger v. Kelly, 115

ering a copy to a person named, "agent of the defendant company,"
may be amended by striking out the word "company." Grady v. Rail
road, 116 N. C
Page 224:. Additional parties.—It is not error to refuse to allow
a junior judgment creditor to be made party to an action to foreclose a
prior mortgage in order that he may attack the bona fides of the mort
gage. His remedy is by an independent action. Bruce v. Nicholson,
109 N. C. , 202.
Page 226. Amendment during trial.—Where the effect of an
amendment to a complaint, asked for on the trial of an action, is neither
to assert a cause of action wholly different from that set out in the original
complaint, nor to change the subject matter of the action, it is not im
proper to allow it to be made, even after the plaintiff's evidence has been
introduced. King v. Dudley, 113 N. C, 167.
Page 226. Amendment in judgment—When, upon a motion to
correct a judgment which had been carried, by appeal, to the Supreme
Court, it appeared that such judgment was not according to the admitted
rights of the parties, and the Court below refused the motion on the
ground that such judgment was res judicata: It was held that there was
error. Beam v. Bridgers, 11 1 N. C, 269.
Where the summons in an action was served upon W. A. F., who was
named in the summons, the fact that a judgment was rendered against
" W. H. F." does not necessarily vitiate it or render it void ; but it may
be corrected by motion in the cause, under this section, at any time, and
need not be made within a year after notice thereof. Rosenthal v. Roberson, 114 N. C, 594.

Page 228. Before Justice of the Peace. —A Justice of the Peace
has power to amend any warrant, process, pleading or proceeding in any
action pending before him, either civil or criminal, either in form or
substance ; therefore, where, in an action of claim and delivery of per
sonal property, the allegation as to the value was omitted in the sum
mons, the Justice of the Peace properly allowed a motion to amend by
filling in the blank left for such allegation. Cox v. Grisham, 113 N. C,

the motion, and the exercise of this discretion is not reviewable. Sikes
v. Weatherly, no N. C, 131; Nicholson v. Cox, 83 N. C, 48.
It is within the discretion of the presiding Judge to permit a plaintiff
to file a reply, though by reason of laches he may not be entitled to do
so. McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. C, 578. See \ 283 and cases cited.

not intended to embrace judgments which necessarily follow verdicts.
Flowers v. Alford, in N. C, 248.
Before the passage of the act of 1893, chapter 81, amending this sec
tion, a judgment based on a verdict could not be set aside for excusable
neglect, etc. Morrison v. McDonald, r 13 N. C, 327; Brown v. Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Page 230. Excusable neglect.— Husband and wife being sued for
the recovery of land, the wife requested her husband to employ counsel
to defend the action, which he promised to do, but being an ignorant
man, failed to give the matter attention, and judgment by default was
rendered: Mela, to be excusable neglect on the part of the wife, and the
judgment against her was properly vacated, although she may not hare
been a necessary party to the action. Sikes v. Weatherly, 11o N. C, 131.
Page 231. Inexcusable neglect. —Where the local agent of an
incorporated company appeared on the return day of a summons, before
a Justice of the Peace, and procured a continuance for ten days, within
which time it had an opportunity to employ counsel to represent it, but
it neglected to do so until the day of the trial, when, because of delay
in the mail, the counsel was not able to be present until after trial:
Held to be inexcusable neglect. Finlayson v. Accident Company, 109
N. C, 196.
Page 234. Judgment by consent. —An order or judgment made
by consent cannot be vacated or modified, even at the term at which it
is entered, without the consent or acquiescence of all parties to the
action, unless it appear affirmatively that its rendition was procured by
the mutual mistake of all parties, or by fraud. Deaver v. Jones, 114
N. C, 649.
Page 230. Irregular judgments. —While Courts have the power
to correct their records and set aside irregular judgments at any time,
they will not exercise this power where there has been long delay or
unexplained laches on the part of those seeking relief against the judg
ment complained of, especially where the rights of third persons may
be affected. Harrison v. Hargrove, 109 N. C , 346.
The proper remedy is to have an irregular judgment, though final, set
aside by a motion in the cause. Everett v. Reynolds, 114 N. C. 367.
Page 240. Independent action. —The remedy against a final
judgment, on the ground of fraud, is by an independent action, and not
by motion in the original cause. Smallwood v. Trenwith, 11o N. C, 91.
A judgment may be set aside for irregularity only upon the application
of a party thereto; if it is sought to set it aside for fraud, an independent
action should be instituted by the party desiring such relief. Uzzle v.
Vinson, 111 N. C, 138.
Page 242. Justices' judgment. —A motion to vacate a judgment
rendered in the court of a Justice of the Peace for irregularity, should
be made before the Justice who gave the judgment, or his successor,
notwithstanding it may have been docketed in the Superior Court. The
latter Court has n0 jurisdiction except upon appeal. Whitehurst v. Trans
portation Co., 109 N. C, 342.
If the judgment has been docketed in the Superior Court and subse
quently vacated by the Justice of the Peace, the defendant may, upon
motion, have the judgment therein set aside; such docketing, however,
only operates as a judgment of the Superior Court for the purposes of
lien. Whitehurst v. Transportation Co., 109 N. C, 342.
Sec. 27S, page 247. Partition.—While a formal direction to make
title is not always uecessary in partition, a confirmation of sale cannot
be dispensed with. In re Dickerson, i11 N. C, 108.
When the plaintiff in partition of lands claims to hold as a tenant in
common with the defendant, and defendant denies plaintiff's title, and
claims sole ownership of the property, the burden of proof is on the
plaintiff to establish his title. Honeycutt v. Brooks, 116 N. C. See \ 281
and cases there cited.
Page 247. Dower. —Where the right to dower has been assigned
before allotment, the assignee's remedy to enforce it is by a civil action

Sec, 280, page 249. Summons amended.—Where a summons in a
special proceeding was improperly made, returnable to the Superior
Court in term, it was proper for the Judge to remand the proceeding,
with directions that the summons be amended so as to make it returna
ble before the Clerk on a day certain. Simmons v. Steamboat Company,
113 N. C, 147.
Sec. 2S1, page 240. Petition for partition.—A sale for partition will
not be decreed where there are contingent remainders or other future
conditional interests, unless all the persons who may be by any possi
bility interested unite in asking for such decree, the Act of 1887, ch. 214,
not applying to such contingent estates and interests. Aydlett v. Pen
dleton, in N. C, 28.
While a petition for partition of land is defective which does not set
forth that the petitioners are tenants in common and in possession (the
general rule being that possession of one tenant in common is the pos
session of all), yet the omission of such allegation does not deprive the
Clerk of jurisdiction, but constitutes simply a defective statement of a
cause of action. Godwin v. Early, 114 N. C, 11. See g$ 278 and 284,
and cases there cited.
Sec. 284, page 2X1. Sale of land for assets.—A petition to subject
lands to sale to make assets is defective where it fails to set forth "the
value of the personal estate of the intestate and the application there
of," and for such defect it is demurrable. McNeill v. McBryde, 112
N. C, 408; Shields v. McDowell, 82 N. C, 137.
Sec. 288, page 254. Directory only.—The requirement that orders
and judgments should be signed by the Judge is directory only, not
mandatory. Keener v. Goodson, 89 N. C, 273; Spencer v. Credle, 102
N. C, 68; Bond v. Wool, 113 N. C, 20.
Sec. 280, page 255. Power of the Judge. —A Judge cannot, upon
exceptions filed to the report of commissioners appointed to assess
damages caused by the location and construction of a railway, alter the
report by inserting a different amount of damages, or annul the order
appointing the commissioners and submit the matter to a jury ; but he
has the discretionary power to confirm or set aside such report, and may
recommit the question to the same or other commissioners, and in aid of
this power he may hear affidavits. Hanes v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 490;
Worthington v. Coward, 114 N. C, 289.
Sec. 290, page 256. Orders made outside of the county. —The rule
that, except by consent or in those cases specially permitted by statute,
the Judge can make no order in a cause outside of the county where it
is pending, applies only to judgments on the merits or to motions in the
cause strictly so called, but does not apply to ancillary proceedings, as
arrest and bail, etc. Parker v. McPhail, 112 N. C, 502.
Sec. 291 (2), page 258. 8ednction. —Seduction is such an injury to
"person or character" as authorizes arrest under this section, and in
volves also "fraud" and "deceit," ex vi termini. Hood v. Sudderth,
in N. C, 215.
Page 258. Applies to all fiduciaries. —Where consignees agree to
hold goods, or the proceeds of the sale thereof, or the notes given there
for, in trust for the consignors, a fiduciary relation is established, and a
violation of the contract is a breach of trust, for which, upon proper
affidavits and the required undertaking, an order of arrest could be
obtained. Boykin v. Maddrey, 114 N. C, 89.
Sec. 291 (4), page 259. Fraud of one partner. —Where members of
a firm assume a fiduciary relation as to property committed to them, and
a misappropriation is made by one partner with the knowledge, con
nivance or consent of the other, the intent of the latter to commit a
breach of trust is conclusively presumed, for all the purposes of arrest
and bail, from such knowledge and act. Boykin v. Maddrey, 114
N. C, 90.
Sec. 293, page 261. Finding of fact. —Where, on the hearing of a
motion to vacate an order of arrest, the Judge finds as a fact that the
act upon which it was based was not committed, the finding is final and
cannot be reviewed. Parker v. McPhail, 112 N. C, 502.

issue of fraud or allegations of tort being found in his favor [Section
316 of The Code] ; (3) after (or before) judgment against him, by pay

Sec. 305, page 266. Failure of sheriff to give notice. —A sheriff who
accepts an insufficient undertaking in arrest and bail proceedings, or
who, after exceptions filed thereto by the plaintiff, fails to give notice
of the time when and the place where the bail will justify, is liable as
special bail to the plaintiff, and he will not be exonerated from liability
by the fact that he acted in good faith in taking the insufficient bond,
or by the fact that the plaintiff was near by and knew what was going
on when an alleged justification was being made by the surety. Howell
v. Jones, 113 N. C, 429.

mitted one arrested by him upon mesne process in a civil action to go
into an adjoining room, from which he escaped, was guilty of an escape
and subjected himself to liability as bail. The Code, sections 299, 313.
Winborne v. Mitchell, 11 1 N. C, 13.
Insolvency of the principal is no defence to an action against the bail;
nor can a Sheriff, when sued as bail, show in mitigation of damages such
insolvency. Winborne v. Mitchell, 111 N. C, 13.
Sec. 316, page 260. Motion heard anywhere in the district. —Amotion
to vacate an order of arrest may be heard by a Judge out of Court any
where within the district that his duties require him to be during the
time in which he is assigned to the district. Parker v. McPhail, 112
N. C, 502.
Sec. 321, page 272. Demand not necessary, when. —Where plaintiff
consigned to defendants a stock of goods, the latter to conduct the busi
ness in the name of the former and to account to plaintiff for all pro
ceeds, and plaintiff brought action of claim and delivery : Held, that the
denial, in defendant's answer, of plaintiff's ownership was a repudiation
of the contract and rendered it unnecessary for plaintiff to prove a
demand for an accounting and a refusal before bringing action. Woolen
Company v. McKinnon, 114 N. C 661.
Where, in his answer in an action of claim and delivery, the defend
ant tenant denies that the crop, for the possession of which the action
is brought, is vested in the plaintiff landlord, such denial avoids the
necessity of proving a demand before the commencement of the action.
Rich v. Hobson, 112 N. C, 79.
Page 273. landlord and tenant. —Where, in a contract between
the landlord and tenant, no time was fixed for the division of the crop,
the landlord was not obliged to wait until the whole crop had been gath
ered, but had a right to bring his action for the possession of the crop
before it was fully harvested, Rich v. Hobson, 112 N, C, 79.
Page 273. Title to crop held as security. —Where E. bought the
interest of his partner B. in a crop and agreed that the title to the crop
should be in B. until the purchase-money, expenses, etc., should be paid
by the purchaser: Held, that the effect of the contract was to place the
title to the entire crop in B. until the amount therein specified was paid,
and hence that claim and delivery would lie. Buffkins v. Eason, 112
N. C, 162.
Page 274. Por undivided part of crop. —Crops produced by the
tenant being vested in the lessor until the rents shall be paid, he can
maintain an action for the recovery of an undivided portion thereof, and
it is not necessary that he shall specifically designate in his complaint,
or affidavit in claim and delivery, such undivided part. Boone v. Darden, 109 N. C, 74.
Page 27S, Before Justice of the Peace.—Where the ancillary
remedy for property over $50 is joined with an action for debt under
$200, the Justice should assume jurisdiction, merely denying the-relief
of a delivery of the crop. Hargrove v. Harris, 116 N. C.J Starke v.
Cotton, 115 N. C, 81; Deloach v. Coman, 90 N. C, 186; Morris v.
O'Briant, 94 N. C, 72 ; see \ 322 (5) and cases cited.
Sec. 322, page 27H. Affidavit by agent. —In claim and delivery of
personal property, an affidavit made by ulaintiff "per" another, is
sufficient. —Spencer v. Bell, 109 N. C, 39.
Sec. 322 (5), page 277. Before Justice of the Peace. —Where it is not
alleged and shown that the value of the property sought to be recovered
in an action of claim and delivery is worth "not more than fifty dollars,"
the Superior Court alone has jurisdiction, as it would have had it con
currently with a Justice of the Peace if of less value than fifty dollars.
Kiger v. Harmon, 113 N. C, 406. See \ 321 and cases cited.
Sec. 325, page 279. Exception too late. —The objection that what
purports to be the undertaking of the plaintiff in such action was not
properly executed, comes too late when made at the trial term. Spencer
v. Bell, 109 N. C, 39.
Sec. 32(i, page 280. Judgment. —In claim and delivery, when, for
any cause, judgment cannot be given for the recovery of the property in
specie, as where, pendente lite, the property was sold under order of
Court, judgment should be rendered for the recovery of the value of the
property at the time of the tortious taking, with interest thereon, in lien
of damages for deterioration and detention, and for the costs. Hall v.
Tillman, no N. C, 220.
Where, in claim and delivery, the property is placed beyond the con
trol of the Court by a sale under an order granted contrary to the course
and practice of the Court, reported and confirmed without objection,
and the proceeds paid to the plaintiff and credited upon the irregular
judgment, the defendant will be allowed credit upon the purchase money
for the proceeds of the sale as of the date of the sale. Hall v. Tillman,
115 N. C, 500.
Page 2S0. Liability of sureties. —Where, in claim and delivery,
the defendant became possessed of the property under a contract of sale
(the property having been sold under an order of Court, pendente lite),
judgment should be rendered against the sureties to the defendant's
undertaking for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged upon the pay
ment of the contract price, with interest and costs, less the payments by
the defendant. Hall v. Tillman, no N. C, 220.
On a recovery in claim and delivery, summary judgment will be ren
dered against the sureties on the defendant's replevy bond for the pen
alty of the bond, to be discharged upon the payment of the judgment
against the defendant, when the bond was given prior to the act of 1885,
chapter 50, and conditioned " that the plaintiff shall be paid such sum
as for any reason may be rendered against the defendant." In such case
evidence as to the valu^ of the property at the commencement of the
action, or the date of sale, was irrelevant and immaterial, and issues
presenting such questions were properly refused. (Clark, J., dissent
ing.) Hall v. Tillman, 115 N. C, 500.
Page 2SO. Sureties liable for costs. —The sureties on a defend
ant's undertaking in claim and delivery are liable for the costs of the
action upon the plaintiff's recovery, notwithstanding the amendment by
laws of 1885, chapter 50, to this section. Hall v. Tillman, no N. C, 220.
Sec. 327, page 281. Sheriff liable as surety. — In delivering property
to a defendant, when seized in claim and delivery proceedings without
taking a proper undertaking and requiring the same to be justified, a
sheriff becomes liable as a surety thereon. Wells v. Bourne, 113 N.
C, 82.
In such case the measure of the sheriff's liability is the delivery of
the property to the plaintiff (if such delivery be adjudged), with damages
for its deterioration, or (failing delivery) the value of the property; and
to subject the sheriff as surety, it is necessary to show that execution
has been returned unsatisfied. Wells v. Bourne, 113 N. C, 82.
Sec. 329, page 281. Injury to building. —A plaintiff who is ad
judged to be the owner of machinery is not liable to the defendant for
injuries to a shelter covering it, done in removing it under an order in
claim and delivery proceedings, unless wantonly done. Hall v. Tillman,
no N. C, 220.
Sec. 334, page 284. Writ of prohibition. —This writ, which some
what resembles injunction, existed at common law and is authorized by
Article IV, section 8 Constitution. It can only be issued from the
Supreme Court. State v. Whitaker, 114 N. C, 818; Perry v. Shepherd,
78 N. C, 83.
Note.—Injunction against taxes, see cases cited on page 294.
Page 287. Not granted if another remedy available. —Where,
according to his own showing, the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at
law, he is not entitled to an injunction. McNatnee v. Alexander, 109
N. C, 242.
Sec. 335, page 288. By what Judge.—The jurisdiction to grant an
injunction till the hearing is restricted to the resident Judge of the dis
trict, or the Judge assigned thereto, or holding by exchange the Courts
of the district within which the county wherein the cause is pending is
situated. Hamilton v. Icard, 112 N. C., 589.
If the Judge before whom the order is made returnable fails to hear
it, any Judge resident in, or assigned to, or holding by exchange the
Courts of some adjoining district, may hear it upon giving ten days'
notice to the parties interested. Hamilton v. Icard, 112 N. C, 589.
Page 288. Outside of the district.—By the act of 1885, chapter
180, section 8, a Judge assigned to a district is the Judge thereof for six
months, beginning either January or July first, and where a restraining
order was made returnable before such Judge at a place outside of the
district, and after the Courts were over, but before the end of the term
of assignment to the district, such Judge had jurisdiction to hear the
application and grant the injunction until the hearing. Hamilton v.
Icard, 112 N. C, 589.
Page 288. By agreement. —By stipulation in writing, duly signed
by the parties or by their attorneys, they may, under this section, desig
nate any other Judge than those indicated by section 336 of The Code,
to hear the application. Hamilton v. Icard, 112 N. C, 589.
Sec. 338 (l),page 200. Against floating logs.—Where it appeared
that there was a serious issue as to whether or not the stream was
"floatable;" that defendant had a large number of logs that would
become worthless if not floated, and that an injunction would stop its
mill, to the great detriment of many people, and so as to damage defend
ant jioo per day, it was proper to permit defendant to give bond suffi
cient to cover all damages that would probably be sustained by plain
tiffs, and refuse to continue the injunction. Commissioners v. Lumber
Company, 114 N. C, 506 ; Lumber Co. v. Wallace, 93 N. C, 22.
Page 203. [Note.—Cunningham v. Bell should have been
cited as 83 N. C, 328.]
Page 204. Against collection of taxes. —The prohibition in the
general Machinery Act against granting injunctions, is applicable by
its terms only to such as are levied by that particular act, and does not
apply when the right to collect taxes in arrears has been revived by a
statute for the benefit of a sheriff's sureties containing no restrictions
applicable to a particular case arising thereunder.
An injunction will not lie to restrain the collection of an invalid or
excessive tax. To obtain relief, one must pay the tax and pursue the
remedy given by Section 84, ch. 137, Acts of 1887. Hall v. Fayetteville,
115 N. C, 281.
Page 294. Against sale under execution.—Under Chapter 6, Acts
of 1893, to determine adverse claims to land, the owner of land is enti
tled to an injunction, pending the action, to restrain a judgment creditor
of his vendor from selling the land under a judgment asserted to be a
lieu upon it. Mortgage Co. v. Long, 113 N. C, 124.
An injunction will not be granted to restrain the sale of land under an
execution against another. Bostic v. Young, 116 N. C.
Page 296. Against official action.—Where a city, by authority of
its charter, granted a street railway company the right to construct a
branch road over a certain street, it cannot, by a subsequent ordinance,
arbitrarily annul its license ; and when, under such latter ordinance, it
attempts, by force, to prevent the completion of the road then in process
of construction, injunction will issue restraining the city from such inter
ference. Railway v. Asheville, 109 N. C, 688.
Page 296. Against a town ordinance. —An injunction will not be
granted to prevent the enforcement of an alleged unlawful municipal
ordinance; nor can an action be maintained which only seeks to have
such ordinance adjudged void. Wardens v. Washington, 109 N. C, 21.
Sec. 338 (2), page 297. Insolvency. —While the fact of insolvency
is not decisive of the right to injunctive relief, yet in some cases it
becomes material. Railway Co. v. Mining Co., 112 N. C, 661.
Page 297. Against construction of railroad.—The fact that one
railroad occupies land which is claimed bv another road as its right-ofway is not in itself an irreparable tort which will justify restraining the
defendant from using the land until the question of title can be tried,
especially when it is not alleged that the defendant is insolvent, and
where it appears that there is room on the disputed territory for the con
struction of both roads. Railway Co. v. Mining Co., 112 N. C, 661.
An injunction will not issue to restrain a railroad company which has
instituted condemnation proceedings from wrongfully entering before
the appraisal of damages and the payment thereof into Court, when it
has given ample bond to cover any damage resulting from such action
on its part. Railroad Co. v. Lumber Co., 116 N. C.
Page 298. Where injury is conjectural. —When the facts upon
which an injunction was granted until the hearing and a receiver was
appointed by the Judge below are controverted and doubtful, the Supreme
Court will not interfere with the orders, especially when it appears that
no serious injury to any of the parties can arise therefrom. Nimocks v.
Shingle Co., 110 N. C, 230.
Page 298. Where evidence is conflicting. —Where there is a seri
ous dispute in reference to a very material fact, an injunction is properly
granted until the hearing. Moore v. Sugg, 112 N. C., 233.
A party seeking an interlocutory injunction is not required to establish
his right with the same precision and certainty that is necessary on the
final hearing ; therefore, while on the trial of an issue as to the existence
of a parol trust, the plaintiff must produce strong and convincing proof
of an agreement amounting to a trust existing at the time, the rule does
not apply to the intensity of proof to be offered in the prosecution of a
remedy ancillary to the real object of the action. Faison v. Hardy, 114
N. C.,58.
Page 299. Against sale under mortgage. —Where a mortgagor in
possession has a full defence to an action for ejectment, when brought
by a purchaser at a sale under a mortgage barred by the statute of lim
itations, the Court will not interfere by injunction to prevent a sale
threatened by the mortgagee. It would be otherwise if there were a
contest as to the amount due under the mortgage. Hutaflf v. Adrian, 1 12
N. C, 259.
A mortgage given to secure an agreement connected with the traffic in
public office being void, an injunction will lie to restrain a sale there
under. Basket v. Moss, 115 N. C, 448.
Where an application is made for an injunction restraining the sale of
land, and a well-defined issue is raised by the affidavits and counteraffidavits involving the equity for exoneration and cancellation, it was
proper for the Judge before whom the motion was made to continue the
injunction to the hearing. Davis v. Lassiter, 112 N. C, 128; Faison v.
Hardy, 114 N. C, 58.
Page 300. Against sale by assignee. —Where there is a serious
controversy as to the bona fides of an assignment and of the debts pre
ferred, as well as of the fitness of the assignee, an injunction should be
granted to prevent the selling of the property pending litigation. Preiss
v. Cohen, 112 N. C, 278.
Page 300. In restraint of trade. —The mortgagor in a mortgage
to secure the purchase money of a stock of goods is not the agent of the
mortgagee in the sense of conducting a business forbidden by a contract
between the mortgagee and plaintiffs, and cannot be enjoined from car
rying it on. Reeves v. Sprague, 114 N. C, 647.
Sec. 340, page 301. Perpetual injunction. —A perpetual injunction
can be granted only in the county where the cause is pending, and by
the Judge who tries the cause at the final hearing. Hamilton v. Icard,
112 N. C, 589.
Sec. 341, page 302.
Amended by adding thereto the following: "Judgment
dissolving the injunction shall carry with it judgment for
such damages against the plaintiff and his sureties on said
undertaking without the requirement of malice or want of
probable cause in procuring the injunction." Acts 1893,
ch. 251.
Page 302. Second undertaking not required. —Where an undertaking
had been given before the issue of a restraining order, it was not neces
sary for the Court, on the return of the order, to show cause and, upon
continuing the injunction to the trial, to require a new undertaking from
the plaintiffs, unless it was shown that the bond already given was insuf
ficient. Preiss v. Cohen, 112 N. C, 278.
Page 303. Damages on injunction bond. —It is immaterial that
sureties were not proceeded against at same time with the principal.
Crawford v. Pearson, 116 N. C
In the action in which an injunction was issued, a motion Jo assess
damages for wrongfully suing it out cannot be allowed before there is a
final determination that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto. Crawford
v. Pearson, 116 N. C; Thompson v. McNair, 64 N. C, 448.
The Code does not contemplate that a separate action shall be brought
for damages sustained by the wrongful suing out of an injunction.
Crawford v. Pearson, 116 N. C
In a proceeding against defendant for wrongfully suing out an injunc
tion, it is necessary to allege and prove that the injunction was issued
without probable cause. Crawford v. Pearson, 116 N. C
Page 303. Filing undertaking mandatory. —The requirement that
a plaintiff shall file an undertaking before an injunction can be granted
is mandatory. James v. Withers, 114 N. C, 474.
Sec. 342, page 303. Writ of Prohibition.—Where a writ for a peti
tion of Prohibition is entertained, the usual practice, unless prior notice
of the petition has been given, is to issue a notice to the lower Court to
show cause why the writ should not issue and to stay proceedings in the
meantime. State v. Whitaker, 114 N. C, 819.
Sec. 344, page 305. Injunctions in favor of enterprise. —Injunctions
which encourage enterprise and facilitate public convenience will be
dissolved only in clear cases. Railway v. Asheville, 109 N. C, 688.
-Page 305. Injunction will not be dissolved, when. —Where the
defendant's assignees positively denied the alleged fraud and their insol
vency, and set out with particularity the facts in relation to their prop
erty, and the preferred assignee produced evidence tending to show that
the money applied to his debt had been in good faith so appropriated
before the commencement of this action, the Court properly refused to
appoint a receiver or to direct the repayment of the money, but granted
an injunction, pendente lite, and directed the other assignee to take
charge of the assets. Flour Co. v. Mclver, 109 N. C, 120.
Where notes for balance due on purchase money were secured by a
deed of trust, and vendees sought an injunction upon the ground that
there were various claimants for parts of the land and suits pending for
one-sixth of it, to which the vendor replied that those matters had been
passed upon by the vendees' attorney, and that the vendees bought with
full knowledge of the pending suits and conflicting claims, the injunc
tion was properly continued to the hearing. Atkinson v. Everett, 114
N. C, 670.
Where there is a serious controversy as to the ownership of a fund, it
is proper to preserve it by an injunction till the hearing. Jones v. Jones,
115 N. C, 209. See \ 338 and cases cited.
Sec. 346, page 307. By what Judge granted.—A restraining order
cfcn be issued in any cause by any Judge of the Superior Court anywhere
in the State, and made returnable at any time within twenty days, at
any place, before a Judge residing in, or assigned to, or holding by
exchange the Courts within the district in which the county where the
cause is pending is situated. Hamilton v. Icard, 112 N. C, 589.
Sec. 347, page 308.
Amended by inserting before the word "personal" in
subdivision three, the words "real or." Acts 1893, chap
ter 77.
Page 308. For what causes.—Service of process by publication
based on an attachment issued in an action for unliquidated damages is
invalid, except in cases specified in this section, and amendatory act,
chapter 77, acts 1893. Mullen v. Canal Company, 114 N. C, 8; Long
v. Ins. Co., 114 N. C, 465.
The puncturing gas pipes so as to cause an escape of gas, entitles the
gas company to an attachment for such injury under chapter 77, acts
1893. Gas Co. v. Construction Co., 113 N. C, 549.
Page 308. Not strictly in rem. —Attachment is not, strictly
speaking, a proceeding in rem, and a judgment therein is only conclu
sive upon the parties to it, and those in privity with them. Hornthal v.
Burwell, 109 N. C, 11.
Sec. 349, page 311. Amendment of affidavit.—The Court has power
to permit amendment of an affidavit in attachment proceedings which
was insufficient as failing to state how the debt arose, and from an order
granting such amendment no appeal lies. Cook v. Mining Company,
114 N. C, 617.
An amendment of an insufficient affidavit in attachment relates back
to the beginning of the proceedings, and no rights based on such irregu
larity can be acquired by third parties by subsequent attachments inter
vening between the original affidavit and the amendment. Cook v.
Mining Company, 114 N. C, 617.
Page 311. Affidavit by agent. —An affidavit in attachment, if
made by an agent, need not state why it is not made by the principal.
Sheldon v. Kivett, 110N. C, 408.
Page 311. Requirements in affidavit. —An affidavit upon which
a warrant of attachment has issued, and which does not allege that the
defendant has property in this State, is not defective on that account.
Windley v. Broadway, 77 N. C, 333, so held, but it was overruled by
Branch v. Frank, 81 N. C, 180 ; Parks v. Adams, 113 N. C, 473.
To obtain an attachment it is not necessary that the affidavit should
state that the defendant "cannot, after due diligence, be found within
this State." Such averment is necessary, however, in an affidavit to
procure publication of summons. Luttrell v. Martin, 112 N. C, 593,
explaining the misleading head note on this point in Sheldon v. Kivett,
110 N. C, 408.
Sec. 352, page 314.
Amended by inserting in line twenty after the word
"county" " for four successive weeks." Acts 1893, chap
ter 363.
See. 357. page 310.
Amended by striking out the words " Provided, such
county be that of the Justice issuing such warrant," in
lines four and five, and by adding to the said section the
following: "Provided, that where the warrant is issued by
a Justice of the Peace to another county than his own, the
Clerk of the Superior Court of his county shall certify that
he is a Justice of the Peace; [and] that the signature to the
warrant is in the handwriting of the said Justice of the
Peace." Acts 1895, chapter 435.
Sec. 359, page 317Amended by adding at the end of said section the follow
ing: " Provided, that where the sheriff or other officer shall
levy an attachment upon real estate, he shall certify said
levy to the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county where
the land lies, with the names of the parties, and the Clerk
shall note the same on his judgment docket and index the
same on the index to judgments, and that the said levy
shall be a lien only from the date of said entry by the said
Clerk: Provided, however, that if such levy is so docketed
and indexed within five days after the making thereof, it
shall be (a) lien from the time it was made." Acts 1895,
chapter 435.
Sec. 373, page 327 . Improper refusal to vacate. —Where a motion
to dismiss au ancillary remedy, as an attachment, is improperly refused,
it will not affect the validity of a trial and judgment on the merits.
Luttrell v. Martin, 112 N. C., 594.
Sec. 375, page 329. Interpleader cannot object to irregularities. —
Parties who intervene in attachment proceedings cannot be heard to
object to the irregularity of the same, that being a matter between the
parties to the main action. Cook v. Mining Canal, 114 N. C, 617.
Sec. 379, page 332. Against married woman. —In an action to have
the contract of a married woman declared a charge upon her separate
estate, equity will, in proper cases, lend its aid by the appointment of
a receiver, or by other interlocutory orders necessary to protect the
rights of the creditors. Jones v. Craigmiles, 114 N. C, 614.
Page 334. Beceiver will be appointed, when. —When it is clear
from the evidence and admissions of the party that it is a case in which
a receiver should be appointed, and that defendant is insolvent, and all
the property must be sold to pay the debts, au order appointing receiv
ers, and directing them to sell all the property of the defendant, is
proper. Machine Co. v. Lumber Co., 109 N. C, 576.
Jfage 334. Assignments. —Where the trustee in a deed of assign
ment for the benefit of creditors was the son of the assignor, and a minor,
and there was no finding by the Court below that hi was unsuitable or
unreliable because of mental deficiency or moral obliquity, and in a pro
ceeding to remove him, he offered to give bond in double the amount of
property in his hands, it was error to remove him and appoint a receiver
of the property. Branch v. Ward, 114 N. C, 149.
Where the insolvency of a trustee in a deed of assignment was ques
tioned and it was positively alleged by the plaintiff, and the defendants
simply allege their belief that he was not insolvent ; and upon being
required to give bond, the trustee refused so to do : Held, that it is
proper to appoint a receiver to take charge of the assigned estate pend
ing the litigation. Bank v. Bridgers, 114 N. C, 382.
Page 334. Fraud. —In disposing of the motion for a receiver,
the Court properly declined to pass on questions of fraud raised by the
pleadings. Machine Co. v. Lumber Co., 109 N. C, 576.
Page 335. Payments not consented to. —When defendants did not
consent that the Court should direct the receivers to pay certain judg

Machine Co. v. Lumber Co., 109 N. C, 576.
Page 335. Burden on receiver. —The burden is upon a receiver
and his sureties to show that he used due diligence in investing the
money in his hands. Waters v. Melson, 112 N. C, 89.
Page 335. Findings of fact. —Upon an application for an injunc
tion and receiver, it is not necessary for the Judge to " find the facts,"
further than to examine the affidavits and determine whether sufficient
cause is shown for the ancillary relief. Bank v. Bridgers, 114 N. C, 381.
Where findings upon which a Court appointed a receiver were not
reduced to writing until three or four days after the order was made, the
order will not be disturbed when it does not appear that defendant suf
fered from such delay. Machine Co. v. Lumber Co., 109 N. C, 576.
Where there was a dispute between receivers and a bidder at a sale
made by them as to what property was bid off by him, and a decree was
entered directing the bidder to pay the amount of his bid. and no facts
found by him as a basis for the decree, it will be assumed that the Judge
found the statements of the receivers and their witnesses to be true. In
such case this Court has no authority to review the conclusions of the
Judge. Morton v. Manufacturing Company, 115 N. C, 198.
Page 335. Receiver should be appointed.—A complaint, on an
application for receivers, alleged that defendant debtor and other defend
ants named, all of whom were insolvent, had combined to defraud the
plaintiff out of his claims against the debtor. None of the defendants
except the debtor denied these allegations. The Court appointed a
receiver for the debtor, but refused as to the other defendants : Held,
that such refusal was error. Pearce v. Elwell, 116 N. C ; Bank v.
Bridgers, 114 N. C, 381.
Page 336. Proceedings against corporation. —The right which the
State has to have the charter of a corporation declared forfeited for non
payment of taxes on its property does not preclude the State from seek
ing the appointment of a receiver of such corporation in order that it
may get what it might not reach by the bootless remedy afforded by a suit
for dissolution. Guilford v. Georgia Company, 112 N. C, 35.
Page 330. Clerks of Superior Court.—When the Clerk of the
Superior Court is appointed receiver of a minor's estate under Section
1585 of The Code, he takes and holds the funds by virtue of his office of
Clerk, and his sureties upon his official bond as such officer are liable
for any failure of duty on his part in that respect, and it is not necessary
to obtain leave of the Court before commencing an action for such failure.
Boothe v. Upchurch, 11o N. C, 62; Waters v. Melson, 112 N. C, 89.
Where, in an order of Court appointing "J. A. M., Clerk of the Supe
rior Court," receiver of infant's estate, the word "as" was omitted
before the words "Clerk of the Superior Court": Held, that the inten
tion of the Court to appoint M. as receiver in his official capacity was
sufficiently indicated. Waters v. Melson, 112 N. C, 89. See \ 383 and
.cases cited.
Page 337. Action by receiver.—Under Section 668 of The Code,
a receiver of an insolvent corporation may sue either in his own name
or in the name of the corporation, and in such suit all the rights of the
parties, both legal and equitable, pertaining to the matters set out in the
pleadings, may be adjudicated. Davis v. Mfg. Co., 114 N. C, 321. See
\ 177 and cases cited.
Page 337. Commissions of receiver. —The commissions of the
receiver are part of the costs and expenses of the suit in which he is
appointed, and should be paid as such instead of being classed as a debt
payable pro rata with other debts. Cotton Mills v. Cotton Mills, 115
N. C, 476.
.Sec. 384, page 340. Judgment at chambers. —In a bastardy proceed
ing the Judge of the Superior Court has no power to make at chambers
any order prejudicial to the mother's rights or interest without her con
sent. State v. Parsons, 115 N. C, 730. Nor to decide any other matter
out of the courthouse unless it is "chambers" business. Delafield v.

ment non obstante veredicto can only be made on the face of the plead
ings. Lewis v. Foard, 112 N. C, 402.
Page 340. Foreign judgments. —A decree of divorce obtained by
a wife, resident in another Stale, against the husband, domiciled in this
State, without personal service of summons upon him, is a nullity in this
State, both as to the relation of the parties and as to the custody of a
child domiciled with its father at the time of the proceeding. Harris v.
Harris, 115 N. C, 5S7; Irby v. Wilson, 21 N. C, 568; Long v. Insurance
Co., 114 N. C, 465.
Page 341. Alternative judgments. —Conditional or alternative
judgments being void in civil as well as criminal actions, it is not error
in the Court to ignore an order or judgment made at a previous term,
directing that if no bond was filed before a date therein fixed the action
should be dismissed, and to allow the bond to be filed. Henning v.
Warner, 109 N. C, 406.
When the Judge signed a judgmeut, but directed the Clerk to strike
it out if a bond was filed within five days : Held, the condition was
invalid, and the judgment was regular and would be enforced. Hopkins
v. Bowers, 11 1 N. C, 175.
Page 34 1. Judgments should properly be signed. —While, for many
reasons, it is the better practice that a judgment should be signed by the
Judge, it is not mandatory or necessary to its validity that it should be
done. Bond v. Wool, 113 N. C, 20; Matthews v. Joyce, 85 N. C, 258;
Rollins v. Henry, 78 N. C, 342; Keener v. Goodson, 89 N. C, 273;
Spencer v. Credle, 102 N. C, 68.
Page 341. In action to recover real property. —Where land was
sold under a judgmeut on an old debt, no homestead being previously
allotted, and in an action for possession by the purchaser, it was decided
that the debtor was entitled to a homestead in the land, which he had
allotted to him after said sale, and which he occupied until he died, the
purchaser was precluded by such adjudication from demanding posses
sion until the falling in of the exemption, and hence the statute of limi
tations did not begin to run against him until then ; and the debtor and
those claiming under him were estopped from denying, as against the
creditor and those claiming under him, that they occupied the land in
dispute as a homestead, and not in their assertion of a title adverse to
the creditor, so long as the homestead right subsisted. Ladd v. Byrd,
113 N. C, 466.
A judgment for the possession of land is conclusive as to title only
where an issue involving the title is raised and passed on by the jury.
Ladd v. Byrd, 113 N. C, 466.
Where recovery ofland is had by a landlord against a tenant because
estopped to deny the title, the record should show the ground of recov
ery, so that the judgment will not work another and more effective
estoppel on the defendant. Dixon v. Stewart, 113 N. C, 410.
Page 342. Judgment an estoppel. —In an action to recover a sum
alleged to be due, the defendant may set up by way of estoppel the
judgment of the Court, involving the same matter, rendered on a former
motion for leave to issue execution on a dormant judgment. Moore v.
Garner, 109 N. C, 157.
Where a proceeding to attach a party for contempt, because of an
alleged disobedience of an injunction order, was terminated by a refusal
of the motion and a dismissal of the rule, the adjudication constitutes a
complete defence against the further prosecution of the matter upon
an affidavit identically the same as (that upon which the first motion
was based. Wilson v. Craige, 113 N. C, 463.
Where judgment had been rendered in a proceeding before the Clerk
between the same parties and on the same question, and defendant had
paid the amount adjudged to be due, and ob ained a receipt therefor,
and the plaintiff assailed the receipt as having been obtained by fraudu
lent representations as to the amount due the ward, but did not attack
the judgment for fraud, or ask that it be set aside, the plaintiff was
properly non suited, though the Court below might have granted, if it
had been asked for, an amendment assailing the judgment for fraud.
Donnelly v. Wilcox, 113 N. C, 408 ; Collins v. Smith, 109 N. C, 468.
Page 342. Judgment not an estoppel.—A Board of County Com
missioners denied and dismissed a petition for a public road, and at a
subsequent meeting dismissed a similar petition for the same road with
out going into the merits of the case, and then, at a later meeting, upon
petition by and against the same party as the first, allowed the public
highway to be constructed : Held, the former judgments and proceed
ings of the commissioners were not res judicata so as to prevent the
establishment of such highway. Warlick v. Lowman, m N. C, 532.
•
Page 343. Void jndgment. —A void judgment is one that has
merely the form of a judgment, but is destitute of some essential ele
ments ; it has no force, and may be quashed on motion, or ex mero
motu, and will be treated everywhere as a nullity. Carter v. Rountree,
109 N. C, 29.
Page 343. Irregular judgment. —A judgment based upon process
which purports to have been duly served, but which, in fact, was never
served, is not void, but is voidable for irregularity, the remedy against
it being by a motion in the cause. Whitehurst v. Transportation Co.,
109 N. C, 342.
An irregular judgment is one entered contrary to the method of pro
cedure and practice of the Court ; and, ordinarily, the mode of relief
against it is by motion in the cause, whether the action has been ended
or is still pending. Such motion may be made at any time within a
reasonable period. Carter v. Rountree, 109 N. C, 29.
Page 343. Erroneous judgment. —An erroneous judgment is one
entered contrary to law ; it cannot be attacked collaterally, and remains
in force until reversed or modified. Carter v. Rountree, 109 N. C, 29.
Page 343. Not a final judgment. —An order of sale in partition
is not a final decree. In re Dickerson, m N. C, 108.
Page 343. After judgment. —An action is not ended by the ren
dition of a judgment; it remains open for all motions and proceedings
for its enforcement, including proceedings supplementary to execution.
Turner v. Holden, 109 N. C, 182.
Sec. 385, page 345. Judgment by default final. —The object of the
verification is, that if the defendant does not deny the allegations, the
cause shall stand as if the jury had been impaneled, and the allegations
put in proof without denial, the purpose being to avoid the delay of trial
upon uncontroverted points. Griffin v. Light Co., 111 N. C, 434.
When a debt is established by admissions in the answer, if the matter
pleaded in avoidance is not established affirmatively by evidence, the
plaintiff is entitled to recover on the pleadings without submitting issues
to the jury. McQueen v. Bank, m N. C, 509.
Page 345. At what term default judgment taken. —The term of
Court at which a complaint is filed before the third day thereof is prac
tically the return term, and if defendant does not answer, judgment by
default final may be taken at such term in cases falling within the pro
visions of this section, and by default and inquiry in other cases. Brown
v. Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Sec. 386, page 347. Practice on unverified complaint. —It is irregular
and not according to the course of practice to submit a case to a jury on
an unverified complaint at return term, without judgment by default and
inquiry, and to enter final judgment on the verdict. Brown v. Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Page 347. If material amendment unverified. —A material amend
ment, unverified, to a verified complaint, renders it necessary to treat the
complaint as unverified. Brown v. Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Page 347. When inquiry executed.—An inquiry as to damages
cannot be executed at the same term as that at which judgment by
default is rendered, unless it is expressly allowed by statute. Brown v.
Rhinehart, 112 N. C, 772.
Page 347. In claim and'delivery. —Where property, the subject
of a chattel mortgage, has been replevied in claim and delivery proceed
ings, and has been wasted, its value, unless admitted to be equal to the
amount due under the mortgage, is the subject of inquiry before the
jury. Kiger v. Harmon, 113 N. C, 406.
Sec. 387, page 348.—Irregularities cured.—The fact that an infant
was not personally served with a summons, in a proceeding to sell land
to make assets, but service thereof was made upon his mother, is not
such an irregularity as will authorize the vacation of the order for sale and
its conflrmation, where it appeared that the infant was represented by a
guardian ad litem. The irregularity was cured by the statute. Carter
v. Rountree, 109 N. C, 29.
Where infant defendants are served with summons in proceedings for
the partition of land, and a guardian ad litem is appointed, a judgment
affirming a sale cannot, in a collateral proceeding by the infants, be set
aside for fraud. Smith v. Gray, 116 N. C
Sec. 393 (1),page 353. Must be raised by pleadings. —Where the
pleadings do not distinctly and unequivocally raise an issue, it should
not be submitted. Sprague v. Bond, 113 N. C, 552.
Page 353. Proper issues. —In a proceeding for the sale of dece
dent's land for assets to pay debts, it was error to refuse to submit an
issue raised by the answer as to the sufficiency of the personal property
to pay the debts. Stainback v. Harris, 115 N. C, 100.
Sec. 393 (2), page 354. Proper issues. —In an action on a note, the
answer averred that if the note was received at all by plaintiff, it was
"received coupled with and subject to all the equities" between defend
ant and the payee, and set up a counter-claim on account of defective
title to the land for which the note was given, and the amended com
plaint denied the averment as to the defective title of the land: Held,
that issues were raised by the pleadings which ought to have been sub
mitted to the jury. Wiggins v. Kirkpatrick, 114 N. C, 299.
Where plaintiff embodied in an amendment to the complaint a reply
and an answer to the counter-claim in a pleading, and the defendant filed
no other answer, but an issue was raised by the pleadings, it was error
to refuse to submit the issue for the consideration of the jury. Wiggins
v. Kirkpatrick, 114 N. C, 299.
Sec. 395, page 357. Issue submitted without objection. —Where an
issue distinctly raised by the pleadings is submitted to the jury without
objection, a motion by plaintiff after verdict for the defendant for judg
ment on the pleadings cannot be entertained. Lewis v. Foard, 112
N. C, 402.
Page 357. Issue not tendered by counsel. —Where an issue in
volved by the pleadings was not tendered, and the issues submitted were
not objected to on the trial, a party in such default cannot complain of
the consequences of his own neglect. Maxwell v. Mclver, 113 N. C 288.
Page 358 Issues maybe changed during trial. —The trial Court
may exercise a discretion in altering or substituting issues, when those
so altered or substituted will permit any specific view of the law arising
out of the testimony to be presented. Blackwell v. Railroad, 111N. C,
151 ; Buffkins v. Eason, 112 N. C, 162.
Page 358. What issues should not be submitted. —It is not error
on the part of the Judge below to refuse to submit an issue offered by a
party upon whom the burden rests, where there is no evidence to sup
port it. Vaustory v. Thornton, 112 N. C, 196.
Nor to refuse to submit issues tendered by the plaintiff having no
reference to the equities set up by defendant. Allen v. Allen, 114 N.
C, 121.
It is not error to refuse to submit an issue when the party asking it
has an opportunity to present, under another issue submitted, such
views of the law arising out of the evidence as are pertinent in support
of his contention. Downs v. High Point. 115 N. C, 182; Hamilton v.
Buchanan, 112 N. C, 463.
Nor as to a claim for damages which the plaintiff has expressly aban
doned. Ward v. R. R., 112 N. C, 168.
Where an issue was tendered which aimed to ascertain the intent of
one party to a contract, rather than what was the agreement between
the parties, it was proper to refuse to substitute such issue for one sub
mitted by the Court, framed to ascertain the agreement. Spencer v.
Fortescue, 112 N. C, 268.
It was not error in the trial Judge to refuse to submit issues tendered
by a party in an action of ejectment, when it appeared to such Judge that
every pertinent inquiry could be presented in the three issues ordinarily
submitted in such actions. Kimsey v. Munday, 112 N. C, 816.
Page 358. What issues should be submitted. —The test is, did the
issues presented afford the parties opportunity to introduce all pertinent
evidence and apply it fairly. Black v. Black, 11o N. C, 398.
Where a controversy as to the ownership of land was narrowed down
to the single question of the date of delivery of a deed, it was not error
for the Judge to submit an issue as to such date instead of the usual one
involving the title. Vaughan v. Parker, 112 N. C, 96.
Where the issues submitted by the Court were substantially the same
as those offered by a party on the trial, it was not error to refuse to
submit the latter. Luttrell v. Martin, 112 N. C, 594.
The form in which issues are submitted is of little consequence if the
material facts in controversy, as appear from the pleadings, are clearly
presented by them, and provided that they be such that the Court may
proceed to judgment, and will allow the parties to present to the jury
any material view of the law arising out of the testimony which counsel
may request the Court to embody in the instructions to the jury. Paper
Company v. Chronicle, 115 N. C, 147; Allen v. Allen, 114 N. C, 121 ;
Fleming v. R. R., 115 N. C, 676.
Page 308. Issue in devisavit vel non. —Upon the trial of an issue
devisavii vel non, the form of the issue, "Is the paper-writing pro
pounded * * and every part thereof the last will and testament of
the deceased?" is in accordance with the precedents and proper. Cor
nelins v. Brawley, 109 N. C, 542.
Sec. 396, page 359. Settled by Judge. —The trial Judge has power in
the exercise of a sound discretion to settle the issues for the jury, and
such exercise is not reviewable in this Court, unless the record shows
that the form of the issues was such as to preclude the complaining
party from having presented to the jury some view of the law arising
out of the evidence. Redmond v. Mullenax, 113 N. C, 505.
Page 359. Concise and direct.—Where the issues submitted to
the jury are confused and calculated to mislead the jury, a new trial will
be directed. Bottoms v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 72 ; Allen v. Sallinger,
105 N. C, 333.
Issues substantially presenting the disputed facts in controversy,
though unnecessarily multiplied, are not the proper subject of excep
tion. Black v. Black, 110N. C, 398.
Page 360. Frame of issues largely in discretion of Judge. —The
trial Judge may, in his discretion, submit one or more issnes arising on
the pleadings, subject only to the restriction that sufficient facts be fonnd
to enable the Court to proceed to judgment, and that each party may
have the opportunity to present any view of the law arising upon the
evidence through pertinent instructions. Cotton Mills v. Abernathy,
115 N. C, 402.
Sec. 397, page 36 1. Written contract. —Where a paper-writing, not
ambiguous in its terms, alleged to be a contract between plaintiff and
the intestate of defendant, was introduced on a trial, its construction
was a question of law for the Court, and evidence as to the declarations
of the deceased tending to contradict or explain the same was incompe
tent and immaterial on either side. Sawyer v. Grandy, 113 N. C, 42.
Where the letters between the parties constitute a written contract, it
devolves upon the Court to ascertain the intention of the parties and to
declare their rights thereunder. Lindsay v. Insurance Co., 115 N. C, 212.
Page 361. Hot an issue of fact.—Whether a libellous communi
cation is privileged is a question of law (subject to review on appeal),
unless the facts are disputed, in which case it is a mixed question of law
and fact. Ramsey v. Cheek, 109 N. C, 271.
Sec. 398, page 361. Bight of trial by jury.—When, upon any aspect
of his case, viewed in the most favorable light for him, the plaintiff is
entitled to recover, the issues should be submitted to the jury. Gwaltney v. Timber and Land Co., m N. C, 547.
Page 362. Economy of time.—Where counsel persisted in repeat
ing questions and asking others entirely foreign to the subject matter of
the trial, and needlessly protracted the trial, it was not error in the Judge,
after repeatedly cautioning the counsel, to stand the witness aside.
McPhail v. Johnson, 115 N. C, 299.
Page 362. Deducting response to one issue from response to another. —
In ascertaining damages for the condemation of land, where the amount
of damages and benefits have both been found by the jury, it is imma
terial whether the mathematical operation of deducting one from the
other is made by the Court or the jury. Miller v. Asheville, 112 N. C, 769.
Page 363. Objectionable language of connsel. —It is not error for
the Court to stop counsel in comments which are not warranted by the
evidence. Houser v. Beam, m N. C, 501.
Nor should counsel be allowed to comment upon any aspect of the
evidence not covered by his complaint. Shelton v. Reynolds, m
N. C, 525The discretion of the Court in permitting comments on witnesses and
parties will not be reviewed on appeal unless the remarks were grossly
improper and calculated to prejudice the jury. Cawfield v. Railroad,
in N. C, 597; Pearson v. Crawford, 116 N. C.
Where objectionable language used by counsel in addressing a jury is
not objected to at the time, it cannot be objected to later. Byrd v. Hud
son, 113 N. C, 203.
Where the Solicitor, in a reply to a remark by the defendant's counsel
that the defendant was a respectable white man, said to the jury that he
himself was a colored man, and that if defendant was a colored man the
jury would convict him in five minutes on the evidence, the error (if any)
in permitting such remark to the jury was cured by a caution by the
Court in its charge to the jury not to be influenced by the remarks com
plained of. State v. Hill, 114 N. C, 780.
It is'not improper for counsel, in rehearsing the testimony to the jury,
to use the stenographic notes when they are read as aids to his memory
and are according to his recollection. Gwaltney v. Timber Company,
115 N. C, 580.
Page 365. Another term held while jnry are deliberating. —The fact
that while the jury were considering their verdict in a case, the trial of
which was begun on Wednesday of the last week of a special term, the
Judge opened and conducted the regular term of Court at the same
place, continuing the special term to receive the verdict of the jury, did
not prejudice the rights of the parties. Bank v. Gilmer, 116 N. C
Sec. 400, page 366. Term of Court.—Section 22 of Article 4 of the
Constitution, requiring the Courts to be always open, must be construed
in connection with Section 11 of the same article, and does not apply to
the terms of Courts and matters connected therewith. Delafield v. Con
struction Co., 115 N. C, 21.
Sec. 403, page 368. After the Judge leaves the bench.—There can be
no session of a Court without a Judge; hence, when the Judge leaves the
bench for the term, although no notice is given of the final adjournment,
or it is ordered to expire by limitation, the term ends and the Judge can
not hear any matters out of the courthouse, except by consent, unless it
is "chambers" business. Delafield v. Construction Co., 115 N. C, 21;
Foley v. Blank, 92 N. C, 476; Branch v. Walker, 92 N. C, 87.
Sec. 404, page 369. Disqualification of regular juror. —To disqualify
a juror of the regular panel for non-payment of taxes, it must appear
that there was failure to pay the taxes for the fiscal year preceding the
annual revision of the jury list, at which such juror was drawn. State v.
Davis, 109 N. C, 780.
Sec. 405, page 371. Disqualification of tales juror. —A tales juror
must have the same qualification as a regular juror, with the additional
one of being a freeholder. State v. Sherman, 115 N. C, 773.
Page 371. Regular and tales jurors.—Under section 1722 of The
Code, as amended by chapter 559, acts of 1889, the County Commission
ers were required on the first Monday in September, 1892, and every
four years thereafter, to put on the jury list such persons only as had
paid their taxes for the preceding year ; hence, a tales juror called on a
trial in April, 1894, was not disqualified because he had not paid his taxes
for the year 1893. State v. Sherman, 115 N. C, 773.
Page 372. Special venire. —The practice of drawing the venire
from the box is commended. State v. Brogden, 11 1 N. C, 656 ; State v.
Whitson, i11 N. C, 695.
It is in the discretion of the trial Judge to order a special venire in
capital cases and determine its number, which he may likewise change
by another order. State v. Brogden, i11 N. C , 656.
Sec. 406, page 372. Not ground of challenge.—Objection that a
juror is on the prosecution bond of another plaintiff in another action,
though against the same defendant on a similar cause of action, is prop
erly overruled. Jenkins v. Railroad, 11o N. C, 438.
Page 372. Challenge permitted by Court. —The Court, in its discre

Page 372. Excusing juror.—The trial Judge has authority, in
the exercise of a sound discretion, to excuse a juror at his own request,
as a favor to him, and before he has been accepted as one of the panel.
State v. Barber, 113 N. C, 711.
Sec. 408, page 373. Practice on return of special verdict. —It is not
necessary to enter a formal verdict in accordance with the opinion of
the Court on a special verdict rendered by the jury. State v. Spray, 113
N. C, 686.
A special verdict in which, after setting out the facts, the jury say :
" If upon these facts the Court be of the opinion that the defendant is
guilty, the jury so find, otherwise not guilty," is sufficient as following
approved precedents, State v. Gillikin, 114 N. C, 832.
Sec. 409. page 374. Papers handed to jury.—There was no error in
refusing to allow the jury to inspect the original writing. "Evidence
should be offered to their ears, not to their eyes." Shelton v. Reynolds,
i11 N. C, 525.
Note.—But the written instructions of the Judge may be handed to
jury. Acts 1885, chapter 137, Clark's Code (2d Edition), page 396.
Page 375. Separation of jury. —Where the jury found an issue
and then separated, and the Judge found as a fact that they had not
been influenced by what had been said to them after their separation,
it was not error to permit them lo re-assemble and put their findings in
writing. Luttrell v. Martin, 112 N. C, 594; Petty v. Roussean, 94 N.
C, 355 ; State v. Shelly, 98 N. C, 673.
Page 375. Permission to view the premises. —The granting or
refusal of an application for the jury to view the premises which are the
subject of injury or accident, lies within the sound discretion of the
Judge. Jenkins v. Railroad, 110 N. C, 438.
Page 375. Conduct ofjury. —It is not competent to impeach the
verdict of a jury for misconduct by evidence proceeding from the mem
bers of the body. State v. Best, i11 N. C, 638.
Where a jury purchased whiskey, and "some of them were under its
influence " while deliberating on their verdict, a new trial will be
grante'l. State v. Jenkins, 116 N. C
Page 375. Informality in verdict.—Although the verdict of a
jury should be set aside where it is so inconsistent in its responses to the
issues, or with the pleadings, that the Court cannot determine what
judgment should be rendered in favor of a given party, or which of the
parties is entitled to judgment, yet, mere informality will not vitiate a
verdict, and it should not be set aside when the two findings will sup
port precisely the same judgment in favor of the same party, and where
no injustice will result from an adjudication upon the substance or gen
eral purport of the verdict. McCaskill v. Currie, 113 N. C, 313; Haw
kins v. House, 65 N. C, 614 ; McMahon v. Miller, 82 N. C, 317; Walker
v. Mebane, 90 N. C, 259 ; McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. O, 579.
It was error in the Court to disregard the adverse finding upon the issue
in respect to the ownership, and render judgment for the plaintiff. It
being uncertain, from the other issues, whether the amount awarded
defendant was in excess or diminution of the amount found due on the
purchase-money, the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted.
Kornegay v. Kornegay, 109 N. C, 188.
In answer to an issue, " Is F, the owner of the property described in
the pleadings, or any part thereof? If so, what part?" the jury responded
"Yes": Held, that the response was sufficiently intelligible, and was
properly construed to mean that F. was the owner of all the property.

evidence sufficient to go to the jury, for treated as an omission to charge,
it is not ground for exception, in the absence of a prayer for instruction,
and treated otherwise than as an omission, it is waived when not taken
at the time. State v. Kiger, 115 N. C, 746; State v. Keath, 83 N. C,
626; Watson v. Sugg, 101 N. C, 188; State v. Brady, 104 N. C, 737;

——Page 381. Exception to inadvertence by the Judge. —That the
Judge, during the progress of the trial, made a memorandum in small
letters and figures on the paper containing the issues, which corre
sponded with the answer given by the jury to that issue, which he inad
vertently omitted to erase before handing the paper to the jury, cannot
be first excepted to in the appellant's case on appeal, where, upon dis
covering the memorandum, the jury informed the Court that they had
given the matter no consideration, and the Court was not requested to
set aside the verdict for that reason. Posey v. Patton, 109 N. C, 455.
Sec. 412 (3), page 382. Exception to the charge cannot be made for
first time in the Supreme Court. —Exceptions to the refusal of the Court to
grant a prayer for instructions, or in granting a prayer, or to instruc
tions generally, cannot be taken for the first time in the Supreme Court.
Preferably, they should be made on a motion for a new trial, but it is suf
ficient if they are assigned in the statement of the case on appeal. Lee
v. Williams, m N. C, 200; Hooks v. Houston, 109 N. C, 623; State v.
Prizell, in N. C, 722.
Page 382. Omission to charge.—The omission to give an instruc
tion to a jury is not ground for an exception in the absence of a request
to so instruct. State v. Varner, 115 N. C, 744.
Page 382. Exceptions must be specific. —An unpointed "broad
side challenge " to the charge, not specifying the particular errors com
plained of, will not be regarded. Hinson v. Powell, 109 N. C, 534 ;
Hopkins v. Bowers, m N. C, 175 ; Shober v. Wheeler, 113 N. C, 370 ;
State v. Varner, 115 N. C, 744; State v. Page, 116 N. C
Page 383. Exceptions to charge may be made for first time in ap
pellant's case on appeal. —It is not required that an exception to the charge
shall be specifically noted at the time, but it is the duty of the appellant
to make specific assignment of error in the charge in the case on appeal.
Hinson v. Powell, 109 N. C, 534; Lee v. Williams, 112 N. C, 510; State
v. Varner, 115 N. C, 744; Blackburn v. Ins. Co., 116 N. C.
Page 383. Exceptions to charge after "case settled."—Exceptions
to the Judge's charge, filed in the Clerk's office after the settlement of
the case on appeal, are not properly a part of the transcript on appeal
and should not be sent up. Hemphill v. Morrison, 112 N. C., 757.
Sec. 412 (4), page 383. Beftualof new trial.—The appellant should
except to the refusal of the Judge to grant a new trial in order to have
his decision reviewed. Grant v. Grant. 109 N. C, 710.
Page 383. Partial new trial. —When a venire de novo is awarded
by the Supreme Court, the cause goes back for trial upon the whole
case (unless restricted to specific issues), as if no former trial had taken
place. Beville, v. Cox, 109 N. C, 265.
Where there has been error by the Court below in respect to some
issues, but which does not affect the others, the Supreme Court will direct
a new trial only on the issues as to which there was error. Jones v.
Coffey, 109 N. C, 515; Tillett v. R. R., 115 N. C, 663,
Page 384. By consent, judgment set aside after term. —Notwith
standing this sub-section requires amotion to set aside a verdict, on the
ground of excessive damages assessed thereby, to be heard at the same
term of Court at which the trial is had, yet, by agreement of counsel, a
motion made at the trial term may be heard and determined by the same
Judge at a subsequent time. Myers v. Stafford, 114 N. C, 231.
Page 384. Affidavits not considered. —Where the facts are not
found by the trial Judge and spread upon the record, affidavits of grounds
for a new trial cannot be considered on appeal in reviewing the refusal
of the motion. State v. DeGraff, 113 N. C, 690.
Page 385. Newly discovored testimony. —It is the settled practice
that pending an appeal to the Supreme Court, a motion for a new trial
upon newly discovered testimony must be made in that Court; and before
the Act of 1887, chapter 192, concerning appeals, such motion must have
been made in the Supreme Court, even after final decree therein. Black
v. Black in N. C, 300.
The granting of a new trial upon newly discovered testimony is, in the
absence of gross abuse, within the discretion of the trial Judge, and a
refusal to exercise such discretion is not reviewable upon appeal. Such
discretion will not be exercised where the new testimony is merely
cumulative or only tends to contradict or discredit the opposing wit
ness. State v. DeGraff, 113 N. C, 690.
Page 385. He-instatement of Judgment. —Where, in the trial of
an action, the verdict of a jury was set aside by consent, it was error to
re-instate the verdict despite the objection of one of the parties, it not
appearing affirmatively that the first order was procured by fraud. Deaver
v.Jones, 114 N. C, 650.
Sec. 413, page 386. What is expression of opinion. —It was prejudi
cial to defendant for the Court to tell the jury that he knew of no direct
testimony tending to show plaintiff's knowledge of the character of
machinery used by which he was injured, and of his consent to its use,
when it was in evidence that plaintiff was present and saw the pole used,
and the manner of its use; and the error was not cured by leaving it to
the jury to say what were the facts after having called their attention to
the contention of the defendant's counsel in regard to these facts.
Young v. Construction Company, 109 N. C, 618.
In a charge reciting that certain facts raised a suspicion as to plaintiff's
ownership of the coupons sued on, a statement that " plaintiff claims"
he has rebutted such suspicion " by showing when and from whom he
got some of them, and that he owed none of the taxes for the years he
received the coupons," is erroneous, as invading the province of the jury.
Threadgill v. Commissioners of Anson County. 116 N. C.
Plaintiff having made out a primafacie case of negligence, whether it
is rebutted by the defendant's evidence is for the jury, and an instruc
tion that "upon all the evidence, if believed, plaintiff is not entitled to
recover," violates this section. Sherrill v. Western Union Tel. Co., 116
N. C.
Page 386. Conflicting evidence. —When the evidence upon an
issue is conflicting, it is error in the Court to direct the jury to return a
verdict for one of the parties—the jury alone being the judge of the
weight of the evidence. Buffkin v. Eason, no N. C, 264; Harris v. Carrington, 115 N. C, 187.
Where there is a direct conflict between the witnesses of each side as
to a material fact, it is not error to instruct the jury that if they believed
the witnesses for the plaintiff they should find for him, but if, on the
other hand, they believed the defendant's witnesses, they should find
for him. Gregg v. Mallett, III N. C, 74.
Page 389. Directing a verdict. —Where the stockholder of an
insolvent corporation, in an action against him by the corporate credi
tors, admitted the amount of his subscription, and that it was unpaid,
and introduced no further evidence, it was proper to direct a verdict for
plaintiffs. Harmon v. Hunt, 116 N. C.
Where the cause of action set forth in the complaint was not sustained,
and the plaintiff did not ask to be allowed to amend, the intimation of
the trial Judge that the plaintiff could not recover is correct Hunt v.
Vanderbilt, 115 N. C, 559.
Where there is no sufficient evidence to permit a case to go to the jury,
the trial Judge may so rule, and withdraw the case from the jury; but if
the evidence is merely weak, and such as might not induce the Judge, if
a juror, to convict, he has no authority so to withdraw the case. State
v. Kiger, 115 N. C, 746.
Questions of intent and knowledge are for the jury, and it was error
for the Court to charge them to find for the plaintiff where there was
evidence upon which they might have found otherwise. Haynes v.
Rogers, 1 11 N. C, 228. Or when different inferences may be drawn from
uncontradicted evidence, as affidavits and exhibits. Machine Company
v. Lumber Company, 109 N. C, 576.
Where, in the trial of an action, the testimony of the plaintiff, who
was the only witness to the material issue, is of doubtful import and
susceptible of two constructions, it is error to instruct the jury that if
they believe the witness, he is entitled to recover. Curtis v. Lumber
Company, 113 N. C, 417.
The Court cannot direct a verdict in a criminal case, even when the
evidence for the State is uncontradicted, for the plea of "not guilty"
disputes its credibility, and there is the presumption of innocence which
can only be overcome by the verdict of the jury. State v. Riley, 113
N. C, 648; State v. Winchester, 113 N. C, 641.
Page 389. Expression of opinion, when warranted. —An instruction
to the jury that the circumstances recited were a strong badge of fraud
was not warranted. It is only where the law gives to testimony an arti
ficial weight that the Judge is at liberty to express an opinion upon its
weight. Bonner v. Hodges, n N. C, 66.
Page 389. Remark of by-standar. —During the argument of a
motion for continuance of a case, in the presence, but prior to the impan
eling, of the jury, a by-stander remarked in open court that the pris
oner's wife said she would not come to the trial because she would only
help get her husband in jail : Held, that this was not ground for excep
tion, as it did not occur on the trial, and, if it had, the remark was not
admitted as evidence, and, being an unsworn statement, it could not
have been deemed to bias the jury against the sworn testimony placed
before them. State v. Jackson, 112 N. C, 852.
Page 389. Correcting error during the trial.—That the Judge
spoke of bastardy proceeding as an indictment, did not prejudice the
defendant when it was corrected in the charge. State v. Williams, 109
N. C, 846.
[Note. —It has since been held a criminal proceeding. State v. Bur
ton, 113 N. C, 655.]
Page 390. Insanity. —Insanity, as affecting the running of the
statute of limitations, is a question for the jury ; and where the testi
mony as to the fact, while not directly disputed, was capable of more
than one construction, it was not proper to withdraw it from the jury.
Asbury v. Fair, m N. C, 251.
Page 390. Negligence and contributory negligence. —Since the
statute (Chapter 33, Acts of 1887) requires that contributory negligence,
if relied upon as a defence, shall be set up in the answer and proved on
the trial, there can be no presumption of contributory negligence, and
it is error in the Judge to charge that the burden of proof is upon the
plaintiff to show that she was not herself guilty of negligence, though
the defendant offered no testimony. Jordan v. Asheville, 112 N. C, 743.
Where, upon an issue as to whether an injury complained of was caused
by the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff made a prima facie case,
the Judge ought to have instructed the jury to find the issue in her
favor if they believed her testimony, and it was error to blend his
instructions on that issue with those on an issue relating to contributory
negligence. Jordan v. Asheville, 112 N. C, 743; Whitford v. Newbern,
in N. C, 273.
Page 390. Wittkowsky v. Wasson should have been cited as
71 N. C, 451.
Page 390. When negligence question of law. —What is negligence
is a question of law for the Court when the facts are ascertained ; and
when the evidence is conflicting, the Court should instruct the jury that
it is or is not negligence, accordingly as they might find the facts to
exist. Knight v. Railroad, 110 N. C, 58.
Page 393. Singling out one aspect of the proof. —When the plead
ings and proofs develop several aspects of the case upon which the right
to recover depends, it is error to single out one and to charge the jury
particularly in respect thereto, and give only general instructions as to
the others, especially where special pertinent instructions have been
requested. Knight v. Railroad, 110 N. C, 58.
Page 393. Conflicting instructions.—When the Court below in
instructing the jury, states a correct proposition upon a certain point of
law, and then upon the same point in another part of the charge, states
a proposition which is incorrect or defective, a new trial will be granted,
as the jury are not supposed to know when the Judge states the law cor
rectly. Tillett v. Railroad Company, 115 N. C, 663; Taylor v. Taylor,
112 N. C, 27.
Page 393. Recapitulation of contention of counsel. —It is not error
in the Court to recapitulate fairly such contentions of counsel as illus
trated the bearing of the evidence upon the issues. Clark v. Railroad.
109 N. C, 431.
Page 394. Immaterial errori. —Where plaintiff was entitled to
recover on any view of the evidence an erroneous instruction in his favor
is harmless. Ki'ser v. Combs, 114 N. C, 640. See \ 550 and cases cited
" Immateriality of Error," p. 586, (2d edition).
Page 394. Omission to charge. —The Court is not bound to charge
upon an aspect of the case not presented in the evidence. State v.
McKinney, III N. C, 683; State v. Hambright, 111 N. C, 707. See
\ 412(3) and cases cited, p. 382 (2d Ed).

Sec. 414, page 390. If asked in apt time. —The Court must put its
charge, as to the law, in writing, however inconvenient, if the request is
made in apt time. Jenkins v. Railroad, 110 N. C, 438; State v. Young,
III N. C, 715; State v. Adams, 115 N. C, 775.
Page 390. May hand instructions to jury. —In the trial of an
action the trial Judge may hand his instructions, in writing, to the jury,
and it is not error, after they have retired, to send, upon their request,
a written memorandum of certain dates necessary to be remembered in
order to enable them to reach a conclusion. State v. Cagle, 114N. C, 835.
Sec. 415, page 397. Bequest to change must be made in writing and

386; State v. Mills, 116 N. C.
Page 39S. Instructions properly refused. —An instruction which
assumed, as proved, certain facts upon which the testimony was conflict
ing, was properly refused. McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. C, 578; Mitchell
v. Bridgers, 113 N. C, 63; Kelly v. Fleming, 113 N. C, 134.
Under the practice now prevailing, the jury, in civil actions, does not
find a general verdict, but responds to specific issues eliminated from the
pleadings, and, hence, it is not erroneous to deny a prayer for an instruc
tion that, upon the evidence, a party is not entitled to recover. Bottoms
v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 72.
Page 398. Exceptions for refusal to charge. —An exception for
failure to give an instruction requested should point out the error com
plained of, and if it involves any question as to evidence offered, that
evidence should be set out. Coltrane v. Lamb, 109 N. C, 210.
Where a prayer for an instruction does not appear in the record an
exception to the refusal of the Judge to give it will not be considered
on appeal. McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. C, 578; State v. Hart, 116 N.C.
Sec. 420, page 406. Arbitration and award. —If it appear that arbi
trators arbitrarily refused to hear any material evidence, their award
should be set aside. Hurdle v. Stallings, 109 N. C, 6.
While arbitrators are not reqiured to find facts and state conclusions
of law, and are not bound to decide correctly the matters submitted, yet
where they voluntarily extend to the parties to the controversy an
opportunity to have their conclusions of law reviewed by the Court, the
practice is analogous to that in reference under The Code; and the party
desiring to except must point out the errors complained of in proper
form and apt time. Smith v. Kron, 109 N. C, 103.
One who seeks to impeach an award because one of the arbitrators
was interested in the controversy, which fact was unknown at the time
of his selection, must make his objection as soon as he discovers the
disqualifying facts. Pearson v. Barringer, 109 N. C, 399.
Evidence aliunde as to the principle upon which the award was based
is not competent; and the award, if regular on its face, and no objection
on account of fraud, mistake or irregularity made, should be affirmed.
Wyatt v. Railroad, no N. C, 245; Herndon v. Ins. Co., 110 N. C, 279.
Though the parties to an arbitration agree that the arbitrators shall
fix their own compensation, yet upon a proper suggestion that it is
extortionate or excessive, it becomes the duty of the Judge to hear, and,
if necessary, to pass upon the question thus raised. Kelly v. Railroad,
no N. C, 431.
Where, a surety on an arbitration bond, guaranteed in a certain sum,
that one of the parties to the arbitration would, in " all respects, fairly
and fully abide by the award to be made by the arbitrator:" Held, that
the bond was not simply a guaranty that his principal would not with
draw from the arbitration, but an obligation that the award should be in
all respects performed, the liability of the surety being limited to the
sum named in the bond. Pass v. Critcher, 112 N. C, 405.
Where a referee was appointed to determine all matters growing out
of a co-partnership, and by the same order was required, as receiver to
sell the property, collect the assets and pay out the proceeds according
to the rights of the parties as determined by himself as referee, and to
report his action to the next term of the Court, to be entered as the
judgment of the Court, and such order was by consent of parties: Held,
that such order was a reference to arbitration instead of a reference
under The Code; and as the findings of facts would be final, under the
terms of the order, all parties were entitled to notice of the time and
place of hearing. Grimes v. Brown, 113 N. C, 154.
While an arbitrator in a submission, under a rule of Court, has a
limited power to make amendments, it does not extend to the making
of new parties, and when such are made without the consent of all par
ties, the award will be set aside. Williams v. Justice, 113 N. C, 502.
When the failure of an arbitration is evidently due to the unreasona
ble conduct of the arbitrator selected by one of the parties who had
notice of all that was done by such arbitrator, the agreement for arbi
tration may be considered as ended. Braddy v. Ins. Co., 115 N. C, 354.
It is not unreasonable for an arbitrator, acting with a view to secure
the service of an unprejudiced, competent and honest umpire, to insist
that only the names of persons living in the vicinage, or in the State,
or in some way known to him, at least by reputation, shall be tendered
to him to act as such. Braddy v. Ins. Co., 115 N. C, 354.
The use of the words "adjudge," "determine," and "award," by
arbitrators, in their award, does not necessarily carry with them the
idea of a judgment according to law, so as to enable one of the parties
to have the award set aside, for errors of law, where the point decided
was doubtful. Patton v. Garrett, 116 N. C.
A mistake in an award, arising from inadvertence and undue haste on
the part of the arbitrators, if not caused by the fraud of either party, is
not ground for setting aside the award, in whole or in part. Patton v.
Garrett, 116 N. C.
Sec. 421 (2), page 409. Beference only after plea in bar disposed of. —
In an action to recover land brought by one who purchased at a mort
gage sale and who, the defendant claimed, was a partner of the mort
gagee and knew that the whole amount was not due, as claimed by the
mortgagee, a reference to state an account would not be proper until
the issues as to the partnership, bona fides of the purchaser, and his
knowledge of the state of account between mortgagee and mortgagor
could be determined. McMillan v. Baxley, 112 N. C, 578.
Sec. 42 1 (3)t page 410. Order of surrey. —The surveyor appointed
by the Clerk under chapter 22, Acts 1893, is not a referee, and his report
should not contain conclusions of law. Duties of surveyor under the
act discussed. Norwood v. Crawford, 114 N. C, 513.
Sec. 421 {4), page 410. Bight to trial by jury.—Upon the coming
in of the report of the referee in a compulsory reference, a jury trial
may be demanded upon such issues of fact as are raised by the plead
ings and designated by the exceptions to the report. McDaniel v. Scurlock, 115 N. C., 296.
When an action is referred by consent, and, upon the coming in of the
report, the order of reference is stricken out, without objection, and at
a subsequent term, and in the face of a demand for a jury trial, and
despite objections, a re-reference is made, the reference thereupon be
comes compulsory. McDaniel v. Scurlock, 115 N. C, 296.
Sec. 422, page 411. Powers of referee. —A referee has power to
make additional parties. Koonce v. Pelletier, 115 N. C, 234.
Page 411. Beferee'B report*—The report of a referee that certain
property sold was part of the effects belonging to the assigned estate,
and was duly accounted for by the assignee, is too uncertain, not stating
the amount realized from such property, nor how it was accounted for.
Sharpe v. Eliason, 116 N. C.
Page 412. Findings of fact. —If the Judge below makes no spe
cific findings of fact, it will be presumed that he adopted the referee's
findings of fact. McEwen v. Loucheim, 115 N. C, 348.
A referee's findings of fact under a consent reference will not be
reviewed except upon the ground, if taken in apt time, that there is no
testimony to support them. Cotton Mills v. Cotton Mills, 115 N. C, 476;
McEwen v. Loucheim, 115 N. C, 348.
Page 413. Order to recommit. —Exceptions to an unsatisfactory
report of a referee will be disregarded and the Court below directed to
recommit with instructions to restate the account in accordance with
the opinion of the Supreme Court. Gore v. Lewis, 109 N. C, 539.
The fact that a referee failed to find certain facts is not ground for an
exception, but is ground for a motion to recommit with instructions.
Tilley v. Bivens, 110 N. C, 343.
Where, on appeal, the case is remanded with an order that the referee
modify his report in certain particulars, so as to conform to the rulings
of the Court, the referee's duties are purely those of an accountant, and
may be performed without notice to the parties to the action. Gay v.
Grant, 116 N. C.
Page 4Hi. Exceptions to report. — An exception should point out
the error complained of. A mere "objection " is not a compliance with
the statute or the rules of Court in that respect. Tilley v. Bivens.
Page 415. Arbitration and award. —When either party to an
arbitration acts in bad faith in order to defeat its real object, the other
is absolved from duty with regard to it. Braddy v. Insurance Company,
115 N. C, 354. see §420.
Sec. 423, page 418. Duty of Judge.—It is the duty of the trial Court
to review and pa.ss upon all the exceptions to the report of the referee,
whether to the conclusions of law or findings of fact, and set aside,
modify or confirm them, according to his judgment. His conclusions
upon the exceptions to matters of law are reviewable, but those upon
the facts are not. Miller v. Groome, 109 N. C , 148.
Page 4 1S). Exceptions, when to be filed. —When the report of a
referee was filed and confirmed at the November term, and at the next
May term the Court refused to recommit upon motion and exception
made at that term, such ruling was not reviewable in the Supreme Court.
Johnson v. Loftin, 11 1 N. C, 319.
Sec. 424 (1), page 420. Judgment in attachment against non-resi
dent. —Where the enlorcement of a debt or other liability is sought by
subjecting property of a non-resident, the jurisdiction is based upon the
seizure of the property, aud only extends to the property attached, and
no personal judgment can be rendered against the defendant, not even
for the costs, or affecting other property within the State. Long v. In
surance Co., 114 N. C, 466.

predicated upon disputed facts not found by the jurv. Spencer v. Bell,
109 N. C, 39.
Page 420. Judgment on mechanic's lien.—A judgment to enforce
a mechanic's lien upon specific property for its satisfaction must contain
a general description of such property, and an execution thereon must
direct that such property shall first be sold to satisfy the judgment.
McMillan v. Williams, 109 N. C, 252.
Sec. 424 (4), page 423. If no pleadings filed.—Where the matter
has pended seven years, during which time there has been numerous
orders, references and reports, two judgments and appeals, an exception
to the final judgment on the ground that there are no pleadings in the
cause will not be entertained, nor is it necessary in such case that plead
ings be filed in this Court nunc pro tunc. McLean v. Breece, 113 N. C,
390; Stancil v. Gay, 92 N. C, 455. See §425.
Page 423. Kefnsal to set aside judgment. —While there was irregu
larity in the failure to report and con firm the sale of the reversion (sub
ject to dower), and the heirs-at-law should have been made parties to the
subsequent proceeding to amend and confirm, yet the Court, under the
circumstances, did not commit error in refusing to set aside the sale.
Adams v. Howard, 110 N. C, 15.
Page 423. Irregular judgment validated. —A motion to set aside
an irregular judgment confirming the sale of land in foreclosure pro
ceedings will not be allowed where there is nothing to indicate that the
parties have been or may be prejudiced thereby. Everett v. Reynolds,
114 N. C, 367.
After thirty years, the recital in a decree of Court that service had
been made on all the parties to the action, some of whom were minors,
will be presumed true on collateral attack, it appearing that the guardian
ad litem of the minors was Clerk of Court, and that rights of third par
ties have intervened. Sledge v. Elliott, 116 N. C

entered in vacation. McDowell v. McDowell, 92 N. C, 227.
Page 425. Against a dead man. —A judgment against a party
then dead is irregular, and may be set aside within any reasonable time,
upon the motion of a person who has acquired the interest of such
deceased party since the action commenced, although such person was
not a party to the suit. Taylor v. Gooch, 110 N. C, 387.
Page 426. Alternative and conditional judgment. —A judgment
permitting defendant to verify his answer upon condition that if the
ruling of the Court gives plaintiff judgment for want of a properly veri
fied answer is sustained, defendant will submit to a judgment in a cer
tain sum, is invalid. Hinton v. Life Ins. Co., 116 N. C.; Hopkins v.
Bowers, m N. C, 175.
Where the Court is vested with power to grant an administrator
"license" to sell real estate to procure assets, an order granting license
to sell "if, in settlement of the estate, it would be found necessary." is
not void as being a conditional judgment, or as attempting to vest the
administrator with judicial power. Sledge v. Elliott, 116 N. C. See$T$4.
Page 426. Judgment an estoppel. —The Clerk of the Superior
Court, having jurisdiction of proceedings against a guardian for a set
tlement, a judgment rendered therein is an estoppel to an action in the
Superior Court between the same parties and upon the same question,
and cannot be attacked collaterally, but can be impeached for fraud only
by a direct proceeding for that purpose. Donnelly v. Wilcox, 113 N.
C, 408; Collins v. Smith, 109 N. C, 468.

judgment on the debt claimed in the main action before the trial of
issues raised in proceedings ancillary thereto. Allison v. Maddrey, 114
N. C., 421.
Sec. 433, page 433. Liability of Clerk.—Where, by consent of
parties, a Judge of the Superior Court signed a judgment at Chambers
after the adjournment of Court, leaving blanks for the insertion of the
amount of costs and referee's fee, and sent the same to the Clerk of the
Superior Court, directing him to fill up the blanks and file the judg
ment, after consulting with counsel as to the amount of the referee's
fee, and counsel agreed upon the fee and notified the Clerk and requested
him to docket the judgment at once, which he failed to do prior to the
probate and registration of a deed of conveyance of all his property by
one of the defendants in said judgment: Held, that the failure of the
Clerk, under the circumstances, to docket the judgment was such a
breach of official duty as to render the sureties on his official bond liable
for any loss resulting to plaintiff therefrom. Young v. Connelly, 112
N. C, 646. The Clerk is also liable for failure to index the judgment.
Page 433. Statute must be followed. —To constitute a lien, a
judgment must be "docketed '' in the manner prescribed by The Code,
sees. 83, 433, 434, and one of the indispensable requirements is that the
record shall contain an index and cross-index of the names of the par
ties to the judgment. Dewey v. Sugg, 109 N. C, 328; Redmond v.
Staton, 116 N. C
Sec. 43f>, page 434. Lien of docketed judgment.—Mnrchison v. Wil
liams, 71 N. C, 135, followed by Mauney v. Holmes, 87 N. C, 428.
The lien created by docketing a judgment does not vest any estate in
the property subject to it in the judgment creditor, but only secures to
the creditor the right to have the property applied to the satisfaction of
his judgment, and such lien extends only to such estate, legal or equi
table, as may be sold or disposed of at the time it attaches. Brnce v.
Nicholson, 109 N. C, 202.
Under an arrangement between mortgagor, mortgagee and a third
party, the mortgagee endorsed upon the mortgage a release of seventy
acres of the mortgaged land sold to the third party, and upon the mort
gage note a receipt of a certain sum, as being the amount received from
the sale of said land to the third party; therenpon, the mortgagor con
veyed the seventy fccres of land to the third party, who executed his
note, secured by mortgage thereon, to the mortgagee for the purchase
price. Subsequently the first mortgage was cancelled of record: Held,
that the legal title did not, by these transactions, revest for an instant
even in the mortgagor, and docketed judgments against the mortgagor
acquired no lien on the seventy acres of land. Johnston v. Lemond,
109 N. C, 643.
Page 436. Priority of lien—Under Acts 1885, chapter 147, sec. r,
providing that no conveyance of land shall be valid, as against creditors
or purchasers for value, but from the registration thereof, a deed of trust
is of no validity whatever, as against a judgment creditor, unless regis
tered. Bostic v. Young, 116 N. C; Gulley v. Thurston, 112 N. C, 192.
A sale of land under an execution on a junior judgment passes the
title to the purchaser encumbered with the lien of prior docketed judg
ments; but where the sale is made upon execution on the senior judg
ment, the title passes to the purchaser unencumbered ; and the lien of
any junior docketed judgments is transferred to the fund arising from
the sale ; and it is the duty of the officer making the sale to apply it to
the satisfaction of the several judgments in the order of their priority,
whether he has executions in his hands or not. Gambrill v. Wilcox,

intestate, as principal debtor. Moore v. Smith, 116 N. C
Page 438. Justice's judgment docketed in Superior Court. —A judg
ment of a Justice of the Peace not docketed within a year from the date
of its rendition is dormant, and its lost vitality cannot be restored by
docketing the same in the Superior Court, but only by a new action
upon it. Cowen v. Withrow, 114 N. C, 558.
Sec. 437 Page 443. Suspension of execution.—Where it clearly
appears that plaintiff has recovered possession of a tract of land when
it, or a part of it, was in actual possession of a person not a party to
the action, claiming adversely to defendants as well as plaintiff, the
Court has the power to suspend the issuance of the writ until, in an
action, the plaintiff should be adjudged entitled to the possession as
against such party also. Ferguson v. Wright, 115 N. C, 568 ; Judge v.
Houston, 34 N. C, 108 ; Springs v. Schenck, 99 N. C, 551.

to issue execution against the estate of a deceased person cannot be
allowed. Cowles v. Hall, 113 N. C, 359.
Sec. 441, page 448. After lapse of ten years. —Where a judgment
creditor delays issuing execution until within a short time before the
expiration of the lien of his judgment and then givts notice of a motion
to revive and for leave to issue execution, and the motion is heard and
the execution issued after ten years from the date of the judgment, a
purchaser at the execution sale of land gets no title as against one who
bona fide bought the land during the ten years. Pipkin v. Adams, 114

Sec. 445, page 452. Return "executed."—The word "executed "
in the return of process ex vi termini carries with it the idea of a fall
performance of all that the law requires ; therefore, a return on a sum

cents," necessarily implies a delivery to each of the two. Isley v. Boon.
113 N. C, 249; McDonald v. Carson, 94 N. C, 497.
Sec. 44(t, page 453. Amendment of return in discretion of Judge. —
An officer has not, " as a matter of law," the right to amend his return
of process in order to correct an error, but it is within the discretion
of the presiding Judge to permit such amendment in meritorious cases.
Campbell v. Smith, 115 N. C, 498.

Sec. 450 (1), page 401. Personal property must be present ats ale. —
Personal property, when sold under execution, should be present at
the sale and in the possession of the officer, so that immediate delivery
may be made to the purchaser. It will be sufficient, however, if the prop
erty is in plain view, or so near that it can be personally inspected by
those present at the sale, if desired. Alston v. Morphew, 113 N. C, 46a.
Sec. 450(3), page 462. Purchaser acquires equitable interest. —One

Sec. 484, page 481. Defendants hold as purchasers from plaintiff. —
Where, under this section, the plaintiffs elect to accept the valuation of
the land fixed by the jury, and the defendants satisfy the judgment, the
effect of such satisfaction is to evict the tenants as heirs of an ancestor

upon his judgment, though it has not been returned, and that defendant
has not sufficient property "subject to execution " to satisfy the judg
ment, but has property " not exempt from execution " which he unjustly
refuses to apply to its satisfaction, is sufficient to support an order for
the examination of the debtor and persons alleged to be indebted to
hira, and also an order forbidding the disposition by the latter of any
effects belonging to the judgment debtor. (Hinsdale v. Sinclair, 83

section applies only to proceedings on judgments for private debts, and
not to taxes. Wilmington v. Sprunt, 114 N. C, 310.
Sec. 494, page 495. Exception to finding of fact. —In supplementaryproceeding to enable the appellate court to review a finding of fact of
the trial court, the exception must be taken on the ground of the want
of evidence to support the findiug. A mere exception to the finding is
insufficient. Hinsdale v. Underwood, 116 N. C.

Page 500. No homestead against debts contracted prior to 1868. —
The debt being one prior to 1868, the defendant, the widow of the exe

Page 501. Mortgage without wife joining void, when. —Where A.,
being financially embarassed and without having a homestead allotted,
executed a mortgage upon his only tract of land, of less value than
$1,000, his wife not joining in the conveyance, the mortgage is void.
Fleming v. Graham, no N. C, 374.
A mortgage of lands by one indebted at the time bars any homestead
right therein without the joinder and privy examination of the wife, if
the homestead had not been allotted and there were no docketed judg
ments upon which the homestead could be allotted. Dixon v. Robbins,
114 N. C , 102.
Page 501. Homestead against "charge" on wife's property —Where
a "charge" is adjudged upon the separate estate of the wife, and a
commissioner appointed to make sale of her land for the payment of
such indebtedness, such charge is subordinate to her right to have the
constitutional exemption, and it was the duty of the commissioner to
first allot the homestead to which the feme covert was entitled, and then
to sell the excess. In such case the allotted homestead cannot be sold
to satisfy plaintiff's "charge" until the homestead estate or right ends.
Bailey v. Barron, 112 N. C, 54.
Page 501. Vendee of homestead takes subject to lien of docketed
judgments. —A valid conveyance of land before the allotment of a home
stead is a waiver of the right of homestead as to the land thereby con

eted prior thereto, but the vendor may subsequently have a homestead
allotted to him in other lands. Fleming v. Graham, no N. C, 374.
Contra : The homestead right or estate is salable or assignable, and
the purchaser can hold the land to which it pertains to the exclusion of
judgment creditors during its existence. Gardner v. Batts, 114 N. C,
496. Clark, J., dissenting. See also Allen v. Bolen, 114 N. C, 560.
Page 501. Homestead valid in hands of purchaser beyond vendor1*
death.—The docketing of judgments against a debtor who holds land in
remainder, dependent upon life estate in another, creates a lien upon
such estate, which not being susceptible of immediate occupancy, is not
protected from sale under execution by the Constitution and laws relat
ing to homestead exemptions. But where, in such case, the judgment
creditors do not exercise their right to sell their debtor's estate in re
mainder, and, by a determination of the particular estate, his right to a
homestead accrues, and he thereupon conveys the land to another in fee
(the land being all that he owns and worth less than $ 1,000), the enforce
ment of the judgment is postponed, not only until the death of the
debtor, but until the arrival at full age of his youngest child. Stern v.
Lee, 115 N. C, 426. (Clark and McRae, JJ., dissenting).
Page 50 t. Conveyance without wife joining. —The owner of real
estate, to whom no homestead has been allotted, and against whom
there are existing no liens under which a homestead might be set apart
preliminary to a sale, may alien his land, no matter when he acquired
title, and pass the entire interest and estate therein, including the home
stead right (except the inchoate right of dower of the wife, in the event
that she survives him), without the wife joining in the conveyance.
Scott v. Lane, 109 N. C, 154.
Page 501. Sheriff's deed of homestead takes precedence of prior
unregistered deed by homesteader. —The plaintiff's junior deed under exe
cution sale takes precedence, by its prior registration, of defendant's
senior unregistered deed of the homestead, and the locus in quo is, as to
the creditors of the defendant's grantor, simply former homestead land,
as to which the grantor had waived his homestead in the constitutional
way, by deed, with the prescribed formalities, and was subject to execu
tion for the grantor's debts. Allen v. Bolen, 114 N. C, 560.
Page 501. Burden on one seeking to avoid sheriff's deed for home
stead. —One who seeks to avoid a prima facie title to land under execu

sale under the laws providing homesteads, must allege in his pleading
specifically the facts upon which the right to the homestead depends,
and the burden is also upon him to establish such facts. Dickens v.
Long, 109 N. C, 165.
Page 501. Ho exemption against allowance to mother, in bastardy

Page 503. Non-resident.—The right to homestead exemption in
this State ceases only when, by reason of a change of residence, it begins
in another State, or when a similar occupancy of a place of residence
here by one coming from another State would entitle him to the benefit
of Section 2, Article X., of the Constitution. Fulton v. Roberts, 113
N. C, 422.
Where it is shown that a person was once a resident of this State, the
presumption is that he continues to be so, and the burden of proving a
change of domicile is upon him who relies upon such change. Fergu
son v. Wright, 113 N. C, 537.
The residence of a person in this State entitling him to a personal
property exemption must be actual and not constructive, and in case of
his temporary removal, it is necessary to ascertain the intent and pur
pose of his removal in order to determine whether he is a resident, hence
where sheriff is sued for attaching property in transitu, the defendant
was entitled to ask plaintiff whether, at the time of the sale of the prop
erty, he had not abandoned her residence in this State and started to
Virginia to engage in business. Jones v. Alsbrook, 115 N. C, 4?.
Page 503. Fraudulent grantor. —Acts 1893, chapter 78, enables
the creditors to immediately sue to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of
homestead as a cloud on the title, and render their judgment a lien on

Page 504. Cannot make up deficiency in another county. —Where
the value of the homestead assigned to an execution debtor, consisting
of all his lands in the county of his residence, is less than (1,000, as
authorized by Constitution, Article X, section 2, he cannot require an
additional assignment of lands owned by him, in another county, to
make the value of his whole exemption $1,000. Springer v. Caldwell,
u6N. C
Page 504. But can make up the deficiency in land already conveyed.
Upon issuance of execution, if the laud in possession selected as a home
stead is worth less than $1,000, the judgment debtor can make up the
deficiency out of any land which he owned when the judgment was
docketed, but has since conveyed to another. Gardner v. Batts, 114 N.

Page 504. Unmarried homesteader. —The fact that the home
steader is an unmarried man, does not affect his right to a homestead
in land he has conveyed. Gardner v. Batts, 114 N. C
Sec. 501 (4), page 510. Notb. —Acts 1895, chapter 397, simply
duplicates Acts 1887, chapter 17, in correcting the word "payment" in
Acts 1885, chapter 359, into "judgment."
Page 511. Statute does not run against judgment lien on homestead
till death of homesteader. —On March 18, 1876, a judgment was docketed
against G., and a homestead allotted on July 31, 1876; she conveyed it
to H. December 29, 1881, and died June 2, 1891 : Held, in a proceeding
by G.'s administrator to sell the land for assets to pay the judgment,
that the lien of the judgment continued so as to be a charge upon the
land, and that the administrator was entitled to sell it to pay the judg
ment and costs of its enforcement. Blythe v. Gash, 114 N. C, 659.
Sec. 502, page 512.
Amended by adding thereto the words : " Provided, that

the County Surveyor or some other competent surveyor to
assist in laying off the homestead by metes and bounds."
Acts 1893, chapter 58Page 513. Appraisers not required to be freeholders There is no
requirement that appraisers to allot the homestead shall have the quali

as ordinary or regular jurors. Hale v. Whitehead, 115 N. C, 28.
Page 5 IS. Children must assert their rights during minority. —
Minor children of a deceased person who were made parties to a proceed

claim homestead rights in the land, cannot, after coming of age, main
tain an action against the grantees of an innocent purchaser under a
decree of sale rendered in such proceedings, to set aside the sale and
recover possession of the land on the ground that it was the homestead
of the deceased, and as such exempt from payment of his debts "during
the minority of the children, or any one of them." Dickens v. Long,
112 N. C, 311.
Sec. 504, page 515. Homestead not subject to re-allotment. —When
a homestead has once been duly allotted, its character in respect to
value and extent becomes thereby fixed, and cannot be changed by sub
sequent allotment. Vanstory v. Thornton, no N. C, 10.
Page 515. But additional value can be reached. —But when the
homestead has once been designated, if the homesteader subsequently
puts substantial improvements thereon in the form of buildings, whereby
a value much greater than one thousand dollars is imparted to the
property, his creditors have the right to have the money or property
so placed on the homestead applied to the satisfaction of their debts.
Vanstory v. Thornton, no N. C., 10.
The right of the creditor to proceed against the property so added to
the homestead is not by execution, but by an action invoking the equi
table jurisdiction of the Courts. Vanstory v. Thornton, 110 N. C, 10.
Sec. 505, page 510. Sale void If homestead not set apart.—A sale of
land, under execution on a judgment recovered on a debt contracted
since 1868 against a resident of this State entitled to a homestead, is
void, unless a homestead has been allotted, notwithstanding the fact
that the tract of land so sold is other than that upon which the judg

Failure to serve the case on appeal on appellee legally and in due time
cannot be cured by the action of the Judge below in thereafter settling
the case. Forte v. Boone, 114 N. C, 176.
The fact that appellant, after the expiration of the time within which
appellee is required to serve his counter case, telegraphs that he will
accept service of the case 0n his return home, and does so, does not
prevent him from insisting (on the ground that the counter-case was
filed too late) that his case be taken as the case on appeal. Watkins v.
Railroad, 116 N. C

Where there is no case on appeal settled by the Judge, and it does
not appear from the record that either the appellant's "case" or
the "counter-case" was served in time, or service thereof admitted,
this Court will disregard both and affirm the judgment, unless error
appears on the face of the record. If both had been served in time, the
appellee's counter-case would be deemed to have acquiesced therein by
not referring it to the Judge to settle the case. Lyman v. Ramsenr, 113
N.C,503.
Page 570. Failure, without laches.—Where appellant's case on
appeal was served within the time prescribed on the appellee, who there
upon mailed his counter-case, with fees, to the sheriff of the county
where appellant's counsel resided, and the sheriff, in due course of mail,
should have received it in time to serve, but did not take it from the
post-office until too late, no laches can be imputed to the appellee. Arrington v. Arrington, 114 N. C, 115. Same is true as to appellant.
Arrington v. Arrington, 114 N. C, 113.
Where the trial Judge is unable to settle the case on appeal because
of the loss of his notes of the trial and of the papers, and the parties
cannot agree on the case, and the appellant has been diligent in endeav

be granted. Ritter v. Grimm, 114 N. C, 373.
Where appellant's case on appeal and the counter-case were duly
served, and the Judge, who was authorized by written stipulation of
counsel to settle the case on appeal, died without doing so, appellant is
entitled to a new trial. Parker v. Coggins, 116 N. C, 71.

failure of the counsel to agree on a settlement of the case, appellant

Page 578. Statement of case conclusive. —The statement of the
trial Judge as to what he said in his charge to the jury is conclusive,
and an exception based upon an alleged instruction which does not
appear in the charge as given in full by him will not be considered.
Paper Company v. Chronicle, 115 N. C, 147.
Page 578. Remanded to settle case. —Where the counter-case
was not served in time without laches of appellee, the case will be re

the appellant's case on appeal nunc pro tunc, and in default of an agree
ment the Judge who tried the cause will settle the case. Arrington v.
Arrington, 114 N. C, 113 ; Walker v. Scott, 104 N. C, 481.
Where an appellant, after exceptions filed to his "case on appeal,"
fails to apply to the Judge to settle the case, this Court may consider
the appellant's "statement" as amended by the appellee's exceptions
to be the case on appeal, and, in case of any complications, the cause
will be remanded in order that the Judge may settle the case. McDaniei
v. Scurlock, 115 N. C, 295.
Where there is no case on appeal, and the appellant has been in no

the penalty prescribed in the statute, he may, after that time, make up
the case. State v. Williams, 109 N. C, 846.

exception is made on the trial to such issues or to the evidence or charge,
objection cannot be raised on appeal that the issues submitted were not

Sec. 553, page 595. If affidavit defective. —Where the substance
only of the affidavit for leave to appeal in forma pauperis is set out in
the case on appeal, and the Court sees that it is insufficient, the appeal
will be dismissed, on motion of the appellee, not as a matter of discre
tion, but of right. State v. Jackson, 112 N. C, 849.
It is for the Legislature to provide the requirements and restrictions
as to appeals without giving bond ; and when not complied with, the
courts have no right to disregard the statute, and the allowance of a
motion to dismiss an appeal in such cases is a matter not of discretion,
but of right. State v. Harris, 114 N. C, 831.

Page 007. Amendment after case comes down. —Final judgment
might be entered in the Supreme Court; but if the case is sent back
without such judgment, it will be in the discretion of the Judge to allow
the answer to be verified. Griffin v. Light Company, i11 N. C, 434.
Sec. 504, page 009. Notice of appeal.—Upon the denial of a motion
to vacate a judgment rendered by a Justice of the Peace, and an appeal
to the Superior Court, in the absence of any evidence of notice of appeal
within ten days from the original judgment, it will be presumed the
appeal was from the judgment refusing the motion to vacate, and not
from the original judgment upon the merits of the action. Finlayson
v. Accident Co., 109 N., C, 197.
Page 60!). Justices' courts not ccurts of record. —The new Consti
tution has increased the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, and requires
them to keep a record of their proceedings, but they are not courts of
record. Williams v. Bowling, in N. C, 295.
Page 009. Recordari will lie. —The remedy against a judgment
by default, because of insufficient service of process, is either by a special
appearance and motion to vacate, or, in some cases, by recordari. The
party seeking the relief cannot enter a special appearance for the pur
pose only of taking an appeal, and thereupon have the regularity of
service determined. Clark v. Mfg. Co., 110 N. C, III.
An action will not lie to vacate and set aside and enjoin the execution
of an irregular and voidable judgment of a Justice of the Peace when
no fraud is alleged, the proper remedy being a motion before the Justice
who rendered ihe judgment, or his successor in office, to set aside the
judgment, or a writ of recordari in the nature of a writ of false judgment
in the Superior Court. Gallop v. Allen, 113 N. C, 24; King v. Railroad,
112 N. C, 318.
Page 609. Recordari will not lie. — Relief against a final judg
ment rendered by a Justice of the Peace, and alleged to have been
obtained by fraud and collusion between him and others, cannot be had
by means of a writ of recordari, but must be sought by an independent
action. King v. Railroad, 112 N. C, 318. See \ 273.

Court means that term which shall begin next after the expiration of the
ten days allowed for service of notice of appeal. Soudley v. Asheville,
no N. C, 84.
An appeal from a judgment of a Justice of the Peace rendered more
than ten days before the next ensuing term of the Superior Court should
be docketed at that term, and an attempted docketing at a subsequent
term is a nullity. In such case the Court properly held that the appeal
was not in the Superior Court, and that plaintiff appellant could not
take a non-suit. Davenport v. Grissom, 113 N. C, 38.
Although where an appeal from a Justice of the Peace is regularly
docketed in due time in the Superior Court, and proper notice of the
appeal has not been given, a Judge may, in his discretion, permit notice
of appeal to be then given, yet he has no discretion to revive an appeal
lost by delay, and to permit the same to be docketed at a subsequent
term to the one to which it should have been returned. Davenport v.
Grissom, 113 N. C, 39.
Page 611. Appeal in fifteen days restricted. —The provision in
Section 876 of The Code for an appeal in fifteen days after notice of
judgment in cases where "the process is not personally served," applies
only in cases where the service is by publication, and has no application
when the summons is personally served on the agent or officer of a cor
poration under Section 217 (1) of The Code. King v. Railroad, 112
N. C, 318.
Page 61 1. Refusal to dismiss. —It is not error, where no want of
jurisdiction is apparent from the record, to deny defendant's motion on
the hearing of the original appeal to dismiss for want of, and for leave
to plead defences to, the jurisdiction. Forbes v. McGuire, 116 N. C.
Page 611. Findings of fact. —The findings of fact by a Justice of
the Peace, upon a motion to vacate a judgment for excusable neglect,
are reviewable, on appeal, by the Superior Court, but the findings of fact
by the Superior Court upon such motion and appeal are not reviewable
by the Supreme Court. Finlayson v. Accident Co., 109 N. C, 196; In re
Deaton, 105 N. C, 59.
Page (ill. Amendment in Superior Court. —Upon an appeal in a
civil action from the Court of a Justice of the Peace to the Superior
Court, the latter has power to amend the pleadings and allow new pleas
or matters of defence to be set up, aud its action in this respect is not,
ordinarily, reviewable. Moore v. Garner, 109 N. C, 157.
A defect in affidavit for attachment may be cured in Superior Court on
appeal. Sheldon v. Kivett, 110 N. C, 408.
It is not necessary that the amendment should have the concurrence
of the Justice of the Peace who heard the cause, nor that the amended
charge should be re-sworn. State v. Norman, no N. C, 484.
Iu claim and delivery, the evidence being uncontradicted that the
value was less than fifty dollars, such amendment could have been made
after verdict and judgment; and if the omission was by mistake or inad
vertence, the amendment could have been allowed in the Superior Court,
not to give jurisdiction, but to make it appear by the summons that it
had not been improperly exercised. Cox v. Grisham, 113 N. C, 279.
The Court can amend the warrant. State v. Gillikin, 114 N. C, 832.
On the trial of an appeal from a judgment of the Justice of the Peace,
in an action to recover for a breach of contract, and also to enforce an
equity, the trial Judge properly allowed an amendment discarding the
equitable proceedings. Starke v. Cotten, 115 N. C, 81.

power, after he has transmitted an appeal from his judgment and all
the papers to the reviewing court, to grant a motion to set aside his
judgment for want of jurisdiction. Forbes v. McGuire, 116 N. C.
Page 6 Hi. Jurisdiction of equitable defense. —Although the courts
of Justices of the Peace cannot affirmatively administer equity, they
have jurisdiction of equitable matters set up by way of defense in actions
properly coguizable before them. Bell v. Howerton, in N. C, 69.
Page 013. Title to land involved.—Where, under a will devising
all testator's land to his wife, remainder to plaintiff in fee, except fifty
acres in some suitable place, on certain conditions, to defendant, and
defendant, who was a tenant of the wife during her life of fifty acres,
claims title to the same as being in a suitable place, and on conditions
performed, an action by plaintiff for possession involves the title to
land, and a Justice of the Peace has no jurisdiction. Wright v. Harris,
116 N.C.

mons issued by one Justice of the Peace cannot be made returnable, in
civil cases, before another (except in cases of summary proceedings in
ejectment), and was properly dismissed by the latter. Williams v.
Bowling, in N. C, 295.
Page HIS. Joinder of matters of which Justice has not jurisdiction.
Where, in an action before a Justice of the Peace, the plaintiff included
in her complaint demands, of only some of which that court had juris
diction, and on appeal to the Superior Court recovered judgment upon
that portion which was cognizable before the Justice of the Peace, the judgment will be sustained. Beville v. Cox, 109 N. C, 265; Starke v.
Cotton, 115 N. C, 81.
Since under Code, sec. 1754, a judgment for rent is a lien on the crops,
a judgment of a Justice's court for rent, also adjudging the judgment a
lien on the crops, is not invalid as being in excess of his jurisdiction, as
the portion of the judgment adjudging the lien will be treated as sur
plusage. Hargrove v. Harris, 116 N. C
Page 0 13. Splitting up account.—Where the plaintiff made suc
cessive deliveries of lumber, the value of each delivery being less than
$200, but the aggregate value was greater than that amount: Held, that
while the plaintiff might have maintained au action before a Justice of
the Peace for the value of each delivery as it was made, having post
poned his suit until the whole sum became due, he could not split the
cause of action aud thereby confer jurisdiction on the Justice of the
Peace. McPhail v. Johnson, 109 N. C, 571.
The defense that the taking of a partnership account is involved, will
not divest jurisdiction of the Justice when investigation shows that the
plea is not well taken. Hooks v. Houston, 109 N. C, 623.
A landlord instituted in the Court of a Justice of the Peace two sepa
rate actions, each for the recovery of a bale of cotton to which he claimed
title under a contract with his tenant, and which he alleged had been
wrongfully converted: Held, that this was not such a splitting of causes
of action as would authorize a dismissal of the suits. Bell v. Howerton.
i11 N. C, 69.
When a creditor, having items of account contracted by a debtor at
different dates, consolidates them and renders a statement to the debtor,
claiming the round sum, to which the debtor makes no objection, the
creditor cannot afterwards separate the items so as to sue on them sepa

Sec. H67, page 01li. The Court will take jurisdiction.— While the
Court has no jurisdiction of a case submitted without action, under this
section, where it docs not appear by affidavit that the controversy is
real; yet, where all the parties interested in the construction of a will
(including the executor, who is claimant and is in possession of the
property concerning which the question arises) agree, as petitioners, to
submit the question to the decision of a Judge of the Superior Court, the
Supreme Court will take cognizance of the case as an application by the
executor for a construction of the will, so as to enable him to dispose of
the fund in his hands. Ruffiu v. Ruffin, 112 N. C, 102.
Pane 0l~>. The Court will not take jurisdiction. —Where a contro
versy, without action, is submitted for the sole purpose of obtaining the
opinion of the Court upon a question, the effect of which might be to
derange for a time the admimstration of the public-school system, the
Supreme Court will decline to entertain the controversy. Board of Edu

Sec. l>70> page 0 17. By corporation. —A corporation may confess
judgment, without action, in or out of term, but the record should show

N. C, 20.
A confession of judgment by the treasurer of a corporation under a
resolution adopted at a meeting of a majority of the stockholders, with

stockholders, is without authority and should be quashed. Nitnrocks v.
Shingle Company, noN. C, ai.
A confession of judgment by an insolvent corporation in favor of a
director who is a creditor, and upon a debt theretofore existing, is void
as against other creditors. Hill v. Lumber Company, 113 N. C, 174.
Sec. 571, page 017. Requisites. —The failure to file with the con
fession of judgment the note or other evidence of indebtedness does not
invalidate the judgment, provided the confession contains a sufficient
description of the nature of the indebtedness to enable a party to make
inquiry and ascertain the truth of the matter. Bank v. Cotton Mills,
115 N. C, 507.
Where such confession is for "goods sold and delivered," it is suf
ficient, although the time of sale, quantity, price and value of the goods
are not stated. Bank v. Cotton Mills, 115 N. C, 508.
The filing is equivalent to an express authority for its entry, and suf
ficiently conforms to the statute. Bank v. Cotton Mills, 115 N. C, 508.
A confession of judgment containing a duly verified statement of
defendant that the amount for which the judgment was authorized to be
rendered was "$2,250, with interest at six per cent, from November 2,
1876, is justly due from him to the plaintiff," and " that said amount is
due from him to the plaintiff on a bond, under seal, for borrowed money
due and payable November 2, 1876," is a compliance with this section.

Sec. 572, page 018. Irregularities.—Ordinarily, a judgment by con
fession without action will not be set aside for mere irregularities, the
party confessing the judgmen being presumed to have waived them;
but where the judgment is void for cause appearing in the record, or the
record omits some essential element, it will be set aside or quashed.
Nimrocks v. Shingle Company, no N. C, 20.
Such irregularities in a confession of judgment as might be corrected
by amendment in the case of ordinary judgments may be the subject of
amendment in a confession of judgment. Bank v. Cotton Mills, 115
N. C, 508.
Page (ilS. Will not vitiate. —A confession of judgment for a
greater rate of interest than the note or contract upon which it is based
bears, will not, in the absence of fraud, invalidate the judgment. Bank
v. Cotton Mills, 115 N. C, 508.
A stipulation in a confession of judgment that no execution shall issue
thereon within a time specified is not such a reservation for the benefit
of the debtor as impairs the rights of other creditors, and does not
vitiate the judgment. Bank v. Cotton Mills, 115 N. C, 508.
Page 018. When void. — A judgment by confession without
action, founded on contract, in the Superior Court, for a sum not in

his adversary his witness. Shober v. Wheeler, 113 N. C, 370.
1'age 028. In any part of district. — Where a defendant, after
assenting to an order made by a Judge in a county other than that in
which the action was pending, but within the same judicial district,
directing him to appear before a commissioner for examination, under
sections 580 and 581 of The Code, appeared before such commissioner
in obedience to the requirements of the order, it was too late to with
draw his assent given to the order when first made, and by refusing to
answer pertinent questions he is amenable, to be punished as for con
tempt. Fertilizer Co. v. Taylor, 112 N. C, 141.
Page 028. Notice not required. —It is not necessary that a party
to an action, who desires to examine the adverse party before trial, under
paragraphs 580 and 581 of The Code, shall first obtain leave from the
Court to make such examination. The words of the statute, "unless
for good cause shown, the Judge shall order otherwise," apply only to
the length of the time of notice, less than five days. Vann v. Lawrence,
'11 N. C„ 32.
Sec. 582, page 028. Appeal premature.— An appeal from an order
of the Court, before which an examination is being made under section
580, directing the examination to proceed, is premature. Vann v. Law
rence, 111 N. C, 32.
Sec. 590, page 635. Sot transactions. —The testimony of a sister
of plaintiff, to whom a note similar to that sued on was executed, to the
effect that before and after the date of the note, her father " was very
bright," was not objectionable under section 590 of The Code, in rela
tion to transactions with a decedent. Ducker v. Whitson, 112 N. C, 44.
It is competent to show by a witness that she saw the book in the
hands of the intestate on the day of her marriage, as that would not
have been a "transaction " with the deceased, but not that she handed
him the book. Lane v. Rogers, 113 N. C, 171.
Testimony that a witness carried supplies to a decedent, is not evi
dence of a conversation or transaction which make the witness incom
petent. Cowan v. Layburn, 116 N. C
Page 935. Marriage.— Marriage is a transaction. Hopkins v.
Bowers, 11 1 N. C, 175.
Page 640. Administrator may elect to testify. —Incompetency of
a witness under this section attaches only to the surviving party to the
transaction, and in an action on a bond, plaintiff administrator of a
deceased person is competent to prove the execution by the defendant
of the bond. Williams v. Cooper, 113 N. C, 286.
Page 640. Handwriting not a transaction with witness. —Although
under this section, a party to an action may not testify to the actual
execution by the deceased person, whose administrator is a party, of a
paper-writing constituting a personal transaction between him and the
deceased, yet he may testify to the handwriting of the deceased, if he
can. Sawyer v. Grandy, 113 N. C, 42; Ferebee v. Pritchard, 112 N.
C„ 83.
Page 640. Evidence in reply restricted to same transaction. —
Where a plaintiff, administrator and distributee of a deceased person,
testified only to the execution of the bond, this did not confer upon the
defendant the right lo testify as to payments made by him on the bond,
nor to cross-examine the plaintiff administrator in regard to such alleged
payments. Williams v. Cooper, 113 N. C, 286.
Page 641. Transaction with deceased agent. — It is competent for
a party to testify in regard to transactions that took place between him
self and an agent of the defendant within the scope of his agency, and
also to the declarations of the agent as a part of those transactions, not
withstanding the agent be dead. Roberts v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 670 ;
Sprague v. Bond, 113 N. C, 552.
Page 641. Plaintiff cannot prove his own execntion of contract. —
Where a paper-writing, alleged to be a contract between plaintiff and
the intestate of the defendant, was introduced in evidence on the trial,
it was error to allow the plaintiff to testify that he himself signed the
paper. Sawyer v. Grandy, 1 13 N. C, 42.
Page 641 . True test of competency of witness under this section.—
The true test of the competency of a witness under this section is,
whether he bears such a relation to the controversy that the verdict and
judgment in the case may be used against him as a party in another
action. If not, he is not disqualified. Therefore, in the trial of an action
to recover land, a person living as member of plaintiff's household on
the land, and aiding in her support, is not a party so "interested in the
action " as to be incompetent to testify in regard to a transaction with a
deceased father of the defendants. Jones v. Emory, 115 N. C, 158.
Sec. 594, page 645. Motion in cause proper remedy. —A motion in
the cause is the proper remedy to attack a final judgment, when, in a
proceeding to sell land for assets, begun in 1881, it appeared that there
had been a sale, under order of the Clerk, pending an appeal to the
Judge upon a question affecting the validity of the order, which order
was reversed upon such appeal, and when it further appeared that in
1885 the matter was ordered to be suspended, pendiug the finding of
material facts by a referee, and that there was an order by the Judge in
1886 affirming the order of sale, but uot the confirmation thereof. Lictie
v. Chappell, m N. C, 347.
Motion in the cause, and not a new action, is the remedy for relief
against a final judgment in a special proceeding for an alleged failure
to serve summons. Grant v. Harrell, 109 N. C, 78.
In 1878 a judgment in ejectment was rendered against a defendant then
dead; writ of possession issued in 1882, whereupon a party who had
acquired the interest of the deceased defendant brought an action to set
it aside, which was decided adversely to him upon the ground that his
remedy was by motion in the cause. At the next term subsequent to the
decision, in 1888, he made the motion: Held, that he had not been guilty
of laches, and the motion was in apt time. Taylor v. Gooch, 110 N. C
387.
Page 646. Judgment attacked for fraud. —When a judgment is
attacked for fraud, the proper remedy is by motion in the cause, if the
action is then pending, but if it has been ended by final judgment, an
independent action must be instituted. Carter v. Rountree, 109 N. C, 29.
Page 647. Action not treated as a motion. —An action brought in
one county to correct a judgment rendered in another cannot be treated
as a motion in the cause. Rosenthal v. Roberson, 114 N. C, 594.
Page 647. When necessary to find the facts. —Upon a motion to
vacate a judgment, it is not required of the Court to set forth its finding
of the controverted facts upon the record, unless a request to that effect
is made by some of the parties to the proceeding, when it would be error
to refuse the request. Carter v. Rountree, 109 N. C, 29.
Sec. 594 (,'i),page 650. Out of the county. —The proceeding for the
examination of a party to an action under Sections 580 and 581 of The
Code being ancillary to the main action, the Court has authority, with
out his consent, to make an order in a county other than that in which
the action is pending, but within the district, committing him for con
tempt. Fertilizer Co. v. Taylor, 112 N. C, 141.
Sec. 595, page 651. Town Constable not authorized to serve case. —
Service by an officer means an officer authorized generally and by virtue
of his office to serve process of the Court in which the action is pending.
Town Constable is not authorized. Forte v. Boone, 114 N. C, 176.
Sec. 597, page 654. Service by attorney.—Unless service of a case
on appeal is accepted, it must be made by an officer ; an alleged service
by an attorney is nugatory. Cummings v. Hoffman, 113 N. C, 267;
State v. Johnson, 109 N. C, 852 ; State v. Price, no N. C, 599.

of the Peace, when the notice is not given on the trial, must be served
by an officer. Clark v. Manufacturing Co., no N. C, in.
A motion heard upon verbal notice given on the day of the bearing
is irregular, and should have been dismissed. Harper v. Sugg, m N.

fieri during the term they are rendered, and motions may be made to
set them aside without notice ; but after that term such motions can
only be heard after due notice. Harper v. Sugg, in N. C, 324.
Sec. 598, page 050. Deputy sheriff may be a minor.—A Sheriff may
appoint a minor his deputy, general or special ; and service of process
by such deputy is not invalid for that reason. Railroad v. Fisher, 109
N. C, 1.
Sec. 002, page 058. "Once a week four weeks" construed. —Service
of summons made by publication from August 3d, to August 31st, the
term of Court to which the process was returnable, heginning on the
latter day, is a sufficient publication of "once a week for four weeks,"
and a compliance with the statutes in that respect. The Code, sections

an officer, the Chief of Police of said corporation, it is not necessary to
allege that the relator is entitled to the office or has an interest therein.

Amended as follows: Insert between the words "thereof"
and "and" in the fifth line, "the defendant, before he
is permitted to answer or demur to the complaint, shall
execute and file in the Superior Court Clerk's office of the
county wherein the suit is pending, an undertaking, with
good and sufficient surety, in the sum of two hundred dol
lars, which may be increased from time to time in the dis
cretion of the Judge, to be void upon condition that the
defendant shall pay to the plaintiff all such costs and
damages, including damages for the loss of such fees and
emoluments as may or ought to have come into the hands
of the defendant, as the plaintiff may recover in the action."
Acts 1895, chapter 105, section 1.
Add to said section the following, to-wit: " That when
ever it shall be alleged in the complaint that the right or
title to any such office as aforesaid has been obtained by
or through fraud practiced by any officer or officers of
election, or by any other person or persons, it shall be
competent for the plaintiff or defendant to examine as
witnesses and to propound direct and leading questions to
such officer or officers, person or persons, concerning such
frauds, who shall not be excused from answering all such
questions upon any ground whatsoever, but such answers
so given shall not be used in evidence in any criminal
action." Acts 1895, chapter 105, section 2.

resulting to the owner in case of disagreement, takes and occupies land
without having taken any valid legal proceedings to have the damages,
etc., assessed, and refuses, on the demand of the owner, to proceed to
have such assessment made, such owner is entitled to a writ of mandamus
compelling the performance of the duty imposed by the charter. McDow
ell v. Asheville, 112 N. C, 747.
The petitioner having shown a clear legal right, which he cannot
exercise until the councilmen perform a duty imposed upon them by
statute, and which they refuse to perform, mandamus will lie to compel
performance of such duty. Wool v. Edenton, 115 N. C, 10; State v.

rendition of the judgment, or of notice thereof. The simple allegation
in the petition that appellant, within the ten days, caused a notice of
appeal to be placed in the hands of the Sheriff, and then it was served,
is not sufficient. Cox v. Pruett, 109 N. C, 487.

A certiorari will be denied where it does not appear that the matters
omitted from the case settled are relevant to the exceptions presented
on appeal, or were omitted by mistake or inadvertence of the Judge
below, although the latter is willing to supply the omission. Bank v.
Bridgers, 114 N. C, 107.
An application for leave to apply to the trial Court to amend the case
by including evidence omitted therefrom, will be denied where the affi
davit merely states that appellant believes the trial Court would make
the amendment, but does not set out the ground of such belief, and there
is nothing to show that the omission complained of was made by mis
take or inadvertence. Riggan v. Sledge, 116 N. C, 87. See | 545 and

therefor is made to apoear, but will, on motion of the Attorney General
or adverse party, dismiss the appeal. State v. Frizell, m N. C, 722.
Page 707. Neglect of counsel. —Where defendant's attorneys
agree that one of them shall perfect the appeal, the fact that the one
selected to attend to the matter was taken sick after notice of appeal
was filed, the other being in perfect health, though absent from the
county on business, is not sufficient excuse for defendant's failure to
perfect the appeal so as to entitle him to a review of the judgment by
certiorari. Boyer v. Garner, 116 N. C, 125.

shall have been given to the adverse party. Keerans v. Keerans, 109
N. C, 101.
An appellant, instead of docketing the appeal during the next term
(as might have been done, the appellee not having moved to docket and
dismiss), towards the latter part of the term applied for a certiorari to
be heard on December 18 ; the required time of notice was not shortened
by the Court, and the notice itself was not given to the officer for service
until the 12th of January, 1894: Held, that on account of the laches and
irregularity of petitioner, the writ will not be issued. Sanders v. Thomp
son, 114 N. C, 282.
Page 707. When notice may be dispensed with. —While the Court
may, in matters of grave concern, permit certiorari to issue on motion
of a party without notice to the other side, or, ex mero molu, this will
not be done where the record shows only technical and not substantial
grounds of exception to the proceedings below. State v. Jackson, 112
N. C, 849.
Rule 48, page 708. Opinion dispensed with.—Where the Court has,
in a former appeal in the same cause, fully discussed the law applicable
to the action, and the principles announced seem to have been carefully
applied by the Judge below in a subsequent trial, and, upon an inspec
tion of the whole record, no error appears to have been committed on
the second trial, the Supreme Court will not go over again the legal prin
ciples discussed in the former opinion, but, as authorized by Chapter 379,
Acts of 1893, and Section 957 of The Code, will not write out its reasons
at length. It will simply announce its decision. Bradsher v. Cheek, 112
N. C, 838.
Page 708. Opinion on same point not necessary. —Where a point
was fully argued, considered and passed on at a former hearing, and no
new authority has been cited and no authority or material fact over
looked, the point will not be considered on a rehearing. Moore v. Beaman, 112 N. C, 558.
Utile 52, page 710. In criminal actions. —No rehearing will be
granted in a criminal action. State v. Jones, 69 N. C, 16; State v.
Starnes, 94 N. C, 973.
Page 710. Rehearing not a right. —Section 9§6 of The Code
(enacted before the present Constitution) cannot be allowed to give the
losing party an absolute right to a rehearing, and to have his petition
considered by the whole Court, contrary to its rule governing the prac
tice in such cases. Herndon v. Insurance Co., m N. C, 384.
Rule 53, page 71 1.
Amended by striking out the provision that the Judge
endorsing the petition to rehear must be one of the Justices
who "concurred in the opinion of the Court," and insert
ing "who did not dissent."
Note. —The intention of this is to permit a new Judge to approve such
petitions; else where all the Judges, all except the dissenting ones, are
changed, a petition to rehear would be impossible.
Page 7 12. Judgment will not be reversed, when. —The principle
reiterated that the Court will only reverse its decision on a rehearing
upon the weightest consideration. Hudson v. Jordan, 110 N. C, 250.
The fact that all the authorities cited in the argument were not noticed
and discussed in the opinion handed down by the Court, is no ground
for a rehearing of the case. Moore v. Beaman, 112 N. C, 558.
Where, upon a petition to rehear, it does not appear that the decision
was hastily made, or that any material point of fact or law, or any direct
authority, was overlooked, the rehearing will be refused. Mullen v.
Canal Company, 115 N. C, 15.
Page 7 12. Point not made on first hearing, will not be considered.
When n0 point was made as to the costs when the case is argued, it
cannot be considered upon a rehearing. It must be assumed that the
Court below did not consider the defence as made in good faith (The
Code, sec. 535), and taxed the costs accordingly. Davis v. Duval, ill
N. C, 835, 713.
Rule 59 has become Rule 60. The following is the new
Rule 59:
Rule 59. Clerk to have opinions type-written and sent to Judges. (Adopted
February Term, 1895 ; 115 N. C, 856.)
After the Court has decided a cause, the Judge assigned
to write it, shall hand the opinions, when written, to the
Clerk, who shall cause five type- written copies to be at
once made and a copy sent to each member of the Court,
to the end that the same may be more carefully examined,
and the bearing of the authorities cited may be considered
prior to the day when the opinion shall be finally offered
for adoption by the Court and ordered to be filed.
The following rules have been added:
Mule 61. Sittings of the Court. (Adopted February Term, 1895; 115
N. C, 856.) '
During the term, the Court will sit daily, Sundays and
Mondays excepted, from 10 a. m. to 2 P. M., for the hear
ing of causes, except when the docket of a district is ex
hausted before the close of the week allotted to it. The
Court will sit, however, on the first Monday of each term
for the examination of applicants to practice law.
Mule 02. Citation of Reports. (Adopted Feb. Term, 1891; 108 N. C, 805.)
Inasmuch as several of the volumes of Reports prior to
the 63d have been reprinted by the State, with the number
of the Report instead of the number of the reporter, and
still other volumes will be reprinted and numbered in like
manner, counsel can cite the volumes prior to the 63d
either as—

Rule 6, page 710• Not reviewable. —The decision of the trial Judge
as to which party shall open and conclude argument to the jury (the
defendant having introduced evidence), is final and not reviewable.
Shober v. Wheeler, 113 N. C, 370.
Rule 14, page 722. In first line of rule, for "Supreme" read
" Superior." ■
Rule 17, page 724. Not sufficient compliance. —The simple naming
of " the children of Alexander James and the children of Calvin James "
as plaintiffs, does not have the effect to make them parties as required
under Rules 16 and 17 of the Superior Courts, which point out the proper
mode bv which minors may sue or answer. James v. Withers, 114 N.
C, 474Rule lit, page 725. Practice in entering judgment. —The practice in
entering judgment on certificate from Supreme Court, pointed out by
Merrimon, C. J. Johnston v. Railroad, 109 N. C. , 504.
Page 725. Sufficient entry. —When a judgment of the Superior
Court was affirmed on appeal, an entry on the docket of the Superior
Court, "Judgment as per transcript filed from the Supreme Court," was
sufficient and a termination of the action. The former judgment having
been merely suspended, and not vacated by the appeal, the affirmation
by the Supreme Court ended the suspension, and the office of the last
judgment was simply formal, to direct the execution to proceed and to
carry the costs subsequently accrued. Bond v. Wool, 113 N. C, 20.
When the Supreme Court, on appeal, decides that plaintiff is entitled
to "the amount demanded in the complaint," and remands the case, a
judgment, following the exact words of the prayer, will be affirmed.
Carter v. Long, 116 N. C.
Rage 7'i5. At subsequent term. —Though the entry should be
made at the first term after receipt of the certificate of opinion of the
Supreme Court, an entry at a subsequent term would be valid. John
ston v. Railroad, 109 N. C, 504.
Rule 24, page 727. Bastardy proceeding's.— A bastardy proceeding
is, in its principal features and purposes, a civil action, and is within
the operation of Superior Court Rule 24, which provides that appeals
from Justices of the Peace in civil actions will not be called for trial
unless the returns of such appeals have been docketed ten days previous
to the term. State v. Edwards, 110 N. C, 511. It is now held a crimi
nal action. State v. Burton, 113 N. C. , 655 ; Myers v. Stafford, 114 N.
C, 234.
Page 727. Privilege of Appellee. —The power given by chapter
443 of the Acts of 1889, to the appellee to docket a case at the first term
of the Superior Court, if the appellant does not, and to have the judg
ment affirmed, is a privilege granted to the appellee only, and the
appellant can draw no argument against appellee from his failure to use
it. Davenport v. Grissom, 113 N. C, 39.
Note.—There are some slight changes in the Rules not noted above,
but they are rather verbal than important, and are not cited, as the
Revised Rules are accessible in the 115 N. C, 833-868.
