party to the action, the trial must be conducted in the following man- 
ner, except as otherwise specially prescribed by law:
1. The sheriff must, from time to time, notify 88 many persons to 
attend, as it is necessary, in order to form a jury of twelve persons,
qnalifl.ed to serve as trial jurore in the county court or the county, or, in

city and county, to try the validity of the claim, 
2. Upon the trial, witnessee may be examined, in behalf of the

was taken by the sheriff'. For the purpose of compelli~ a witness to 
attend and testify, the sheriff, upon the application of either party to
the inquisitioi£ must issue a subpama, 88 prescribed in section eight. 
linndred andfty-four of this act, and with like effect; except that a
warrant to apprehend or to commit a witness, in a case specified in section eight hundred and fifty-five or section eight hundred and

city and county.

'Fitness, produced by either pa.rty, must be sworn by the presiding

civil action.
§ 109. Upon such a trial there are no costs; but the fees of the sheriff', 
jurors, and witnesses must be taxed, by a judge of the court, or the

must be paid as follows : 
1. If the jury, by their verdict, find the title, or the right of posses­
sion to the property claimed, to be in the claimant; by the party at 
whose instance the property was taken by the sheriff.
2. If they find adversely to the claimant, with respect to all the 
property claimed ; by the claimant.

the property claimed, to be in the claimant; each party must pay bis
own witnesses' fees; and the sheriff's and jurors' fees must be paid,
one-half by each party to the inquisition. 
Before notifying the jurors, the sheriff may, in his discretion. require
each of the parties to the controversy to deposit with him such reason­
able sum, as may be necessary to cover bis legal fees, and the jurors'
fees. The sheriff must return to each party the balance of the sum 
so deposited by him, after deducting the fees, lawfully chargeable to 
that party, as prescribed in this section. .

qnired to hold the defendant to bail, if he is in custody under an order of 
arrest, or has been surrendered in exoneration of his bail, before juda-
ment; or directed to be collected by the execution, if be is in custoay
under an execution ; or remaining uncollected upon a ju~eut against
him, if he has been surrendered after judgment; conditioned that the
person so in custody shall remain a prisoner, and shall not, at any time
or in any manner, escape or go without the liberties of the jail until
discharged by due course of law. 
§ 151. A bond so taken is held for the indemnity of the sheriff' tak-
ing it, and of the party at whose instance the prisoner executing it is 
confined.
§ 152. If a sheriff', who has taken such a bond, discovers that a surety 
therein is insufficient, he may commit the prisoner who executed it to 
eloee confinement in the jail, until another bond, with good and su.ffi-
cient sureties, is off'ered. 
§ 158. One or more of the sureties, in a bond given for the liberties
o( a jail, 19ay surrender the principal, at any time before judgment is
rendered against them in an action on the bond ; but they are not ex-
onerated thereby, from a liability incurred before making the surrender. 
§ l54. The surrender must he made as follows, The surety or sure-
ties making it must take the principal to the keeper of the jail, who 
mllSt, upon his or their written requisition to that effect, take the prin-
cipal into his custody, and indorso upon the bond given for the liberties,
an acknowledgment of the surrender; and also, if required, give the
10rety or sureties a certificate, acknowledging the surrender. 
§ 155. The going at large, within the liberties of the jail in which
be is in custody, of a prisoner who has executed such a bond, or of a 
prisoner who would be entitled to the liberties upon executing such a
bond, is not an escape. But the going a.t large, beyond the liberties, 
by a prisoner, without the assent of the party at whose instance be is
in custody, is an escape ; and the sheriff in whose custody he was, has
the same authority to pursue and retake him, as if he bad escaped
from the jail. Buch an escape forfeits the bond for the liberties, if
any; subject to the provisions of the next article of this title. 
§ 156. Where a person, who has been indicted for a criminal offence,
ii held by & sheriff, by virtue of a mandate in a civil action or special 
proceeding, the court, in which the indictment is pending, may make
an order, requiring the sheriff' to bring him before the court; where-~~ 
upon the court may make such disposition of the prisoner, as to it
seems proper. The sheriff''.a ·fees and expenses, in 8Q doing,__~ ~ 
county charge of the county wherein the court is sitting.
§ 157. A prisoner, committed to jail QJ)QD c'l"Clr.888 for contempt, or 
committed for misconduct in a case prescribed ylaw, must be actua11y
confined and detained within the jail, until he is discharged by due
course of law, or is removed to another jail or place of confinement, in 
a caae prescribed by law. A sheriff or keeper of a jail, who suffers 
r, 
such a prisoner to go or be at large out of bis jail, except byvirtue of
a writ of habeas corpus, or by the special direction of the court com­
mitting him, or in a case specially prescribed by law; is liable to the
party aggrieved, for his damages sustained thereby, and is guilty of a
misdemeanor. If the commitment was for the non-payment of a sum
of money, the amount thereof, with interest, is._tbe.IJleMure of dam&J::es. 
§ 158. Where a prisoner, in a sheriff's custody, goes or is at large be­
yond the liberties of the jail, without the assent of the party at whose
Instance he is in custody, the sheriff is answerable therefor, in an
action against him, as follows : 
1. If the prisoner was in custody by virtue of an order of arrest,
or in consequence of a surrender in exoneration of bis bail, before
judgment, the sheriff is answerable to the extent of the damages sus­
tained by the plaintiff. 
2. If the prisoner was in custody by virtue of any other mandate, or
in consequence of a surrender in exoneration of bis bail, after judg­
ment, the sheriff is answerable for the debt, damages, or sum of money,
for which the prisoner was committed. 
§ 159. A sheriff or other officer, who demands or receives a reward,
gratuity, or other valuable thing, to procure, assist, connive at, or per­ 
mit an escape of a prisoner, in his custody, is guilty of a. misdemeanor,
and shall be punished accordingly. A conviction also. operates as a 
forfeiture of his office, and disqualifies him forever thereafter from
holding the same.

§ 160. In an action brought by a sheriff on a bond for the jail liber
ties, it is a defence, that the prisoner voluntarily returned to the liber­ 
ties of the jail from which he escaped, or was recaptured by; or sur-
rendered to the sheriff, from whose custody he escaped, before the
commencement of the action. The defendants may make that or any
other defence to the action, which might be made by the sheriff, to an
action against him for the escape. 
§ 161. But if judgment bas been rendered against the sheriff, in an
action brought for the escape, and due notice of the pendency of the
action was given to the prisoner and bis sureties, to enable them to 
defend the same, the judgment against the sheriff is conclusive evi­
dence of bis right to recover against the prisoner and bis sureties, to
whom the notice was given, as to any matter which was or might have
been controverted, in the action against the sheriff. 
§ 162. In an action brought by a sheriff' on a bond for the jail liber-
ties, if it appears to the court, upon a motion made in behalf of the
sheriff, that judgment hes been rendered against him, for the escape 
of the prisoner, and that due notice of the pendency of the action
against him, was.given to the prisoner and. his sureties, to enable them
to defend the same, the court must order a summary judgment for ·the
plaintiff; and judgment must be entered accordingly, with costs. 
§ 168. But to entitle ·a sheriff' to move for such a· judgment, he must
have served a copy of his complaint, and given twenty days' notice of 
the motion.
§ 164. If it appears, on the hearing of the motion, that the defend- 
ants have· a meritorioos defence, which was not eontroverted in the
action against the sheriff',. and which by law could not have been so
controverted, the court may stay proceedings on the judgment, wit.h
such limitations and upon such terms, as it deems just, until a trial in
the action ; but the judgment must stand as e. security for the sheriff.
If the defence is established, the court must vacate the judgment, and 
'render judgment for the defendant.
§ 165. In an action brought by a sheriff' on a bond for the jail liber- 
ties, a jndgment against him for the escape of the prisoner, is evidence
of the damages sustained by him, as if it had been collected ; and he 
may recover his reasonable e.ttomey's and counsel fees, and other
e~ses in defending the action against him, as part of his damages. 
§ 166. If a bond for the jail liberties is forfeited, the party at whose
. instance the prisoner was confined, or, in case of bis death, his execu- 
tor or administrator, is entitled to an assignment thereof"; which must
be executed by the sheriff who took" the bond, or, in case of a. vacancy
in his office, by his uuder-eherlffcand acknowledged or proved, and 
"certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the county. 
§ 167. The person to whom such an assignment has been made, may
-maintain an action on the bond, as assignee of the sheriff' taking the 
same, in a C88e where an action might be maintained by the sheriff'; 
and be ma.y recover the same damages for the breach of the -condltion, 
.. which he might have recovered in an. action ~inrst the sheriff, for the
escape. 
§ 168. -Ttle·acceptance of an asmgnment of such a bond, is a bar to
an action, by Ol' in1 behalf of the assignee, against the sheriff' Or other 
. officer maki.ng the same, for an escape-by the prisoner executing the
. bond, amonnting·to ·a. breach of the condition thereof, unless the escape 
was with the assent of the sheriff or other officer.
§ 169. In an action brought by the aesignee of the bond, the defend- 
an may make·any defence, which he might make, if the action was
brought in the name·and for the benefit of the sheriff'. 
§ 170. If the person entitled to an assignment of a bond for the jail
libemes, in lieu of taking the same, brings an action against the sheriff' 
for the escape, the -cours may, except where the- escape was made with
the sheriff's assent, stay proceedings upon a judgment recovered against 
the sheriff, with such limitations e.nd upon such terms as it deems just,
until he bu bad a reasonable time to prosecute the bond, and collect
a judgment recovered thereon. 
§ 171. In an action against a sheriff' or other officer, for the escape
. of a priaoner, ii is a defence; thai the escape was without the assent 
of the-defendant; and that at the.oommeneement of the action, be had

county is a. party, a coroner of the same county has a.11 the power, and 
is subject to all the duties of a sheriff', in a. cause to which the sheriff
is not a party; except as otherwise specially prescribed by law. 
§ 178. A mandate in a civil action or special proceeding which must
or may be executed by the coroners, or by a. coroner of a county, must 
be directed either to a particular coroner, or generally to the coroners of
that county. Where such a mandate is directed generally to the coro­
ners of a county, or requires them to do any act, it may be executed,
and a return thereto may be made and signed, by one of them; but
such an act or return does not atfect the others. 
§ 174. Where a. mandate, requiring the arrest of the sheriff' of the
county, is directed to a coroner, he must execute the same in the man­
ner prescribed by law, with respect to the execution of a similar man­
date by a. sheriff'; and he is authorized to take an undertaking on the
a.nest, or a bond for the jail liberties, to himself, in bis name of office,
in a like case, and in like manner, and with like etfect, as where such
a bond or undertaking may be taken by a sheriff'. 
§ l76. Where the actual confinement of a sheriff' by a coroner, on a
mandate, is required or authorized by law, he must be confined by the 
coroner, in a house situated within the liberties of the jail of the county,
other than the sheriff's house, or the jail, in the same manner as a
sheriff' is required by law to confine a. prisoner in the jail. 
§ 176. That house thereupon becomes the jail of the county, for the
use of the coroner; and each provision of law relating to the jail, or to an
escape from the jail, applies thereto, while the sheriff' is confined therein. 
§ 177. A sheriff so arrested must be admitted to the liberties of the
jail of the county, in a like case, and upon executing a like bond to 
the coroner, as prescribed by law for a prisoner in the sheritf's custody.
For an escape of the sheriff' from the liberties, the coroner is liable, in 
the same manner, and to the same extent, as a sheriff' for a similar
escape ; and he may make the same defence as a sheriff. 
§ 178. The coroner may prosecute a bond for the liberties taken by
him, and is entitled to all the rights, and subject to all the liabilities,
prescribed by law, with respect to a similar bond ta.ken by a. sheriif. 
The bond may be assigned by him, to the party at whose instance
the sheriff' was arrested ; and the same/roceedingB may be had there­ 
upon, as upon a bond ta.ken and assigne by a sheriff, in a similar cue. 
§ 179. A person arreated by a coroner, in an action or 8})8Cl&l pro-
ceedi~, in which the sheriff of the county is plaintiff, must be confined 
in the Jail of the county, in a cue where such a confinement is required
or authorized by law; but the coroner is not liable for an escape of the 
prisoner from the jail, after he has been confined therein. A person so
conftned must be kept and treated, in all respects, like a prisoner con-
fined by the sheriff. 
§ 180. A person so arrested by a coroner, is entitled to be discharged,
or to the liberties of the jail, as the case requires, upon giving a bond 
or an undertaking to the coroner, in the like manner, and in a like
cue, in which a person arrested by a sheriff would be entitled to be so 
discharged, or to the liberties. The bond or undertaking so given,
must be in all respects similar to that required to be given to a sheriff;
and it has the like effect, and may be assigned and proceeded upon in 
like manner.
§ 181. A coroner is answerable for an escape of a prisoner, admitt.ed 
by him to the liberties of the jail, in the same manner and to the same
extent, as a sheriff, and may interpose a like defence.

§ 190. The conrt of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to review,
npon appeal, every actual determination, made a.t a general term, by

the following cases, and no others : 
1. Where a. final judgment has been rendered, in an action com­
menced in either of those courts, or brought there from another court;
and, upon such an appeal, to review an interlocutory judgment or in­
termediate order, involving the merits, and necessarily affecting the
final judgment. 
2. Where an order has been made in such an action, attecting a 
substantial right, and not resting in discretion, which either (first) in 
effect determines the action, and prevents a final judgment, or (second)
discontinues the action, or (third) grants or refuses a new trial, or
(fourt.h) strikes out a pleading, or part of a. plea.ding, or (fifth) decides
an interlocutory application, or a question of practice, or (sixth) deter­
mines a statutory provision of the State to be unconstitutional, and the
determination appears from the reasons given for the decision, or ~

3. Where a final order, affecting a substantial right., has been made
in a. special proceeding, or upon a summary application in an action,
after judgment; and, upon such an appeal, to review any intermediate
order, involving the merits, and necessarily affecting the order appealed
from. 
§ 191. But the jurisdiction, conferred by the last section, is subjeet 
to the following limitations, exceptions, and conditions :
1. An appeal cannot be taken, from an order granting a new trial, 
on a case or exceptions, unless the notice of appeal contains an assent,
on the part of the appe1Jant, that if the order is affirmed, judgment
absolute shall be rendered against the appellant. 
2. An appeal cannot be taken, in an action commenced in a court of
a justice of the peace, or in the marine court of the city of New York, 
or in a district court of that city, or in the city court of Youkers, or in
a justices' court of a city. unless the court below allows the appeal, by
an order made at the general term which rendered the determination,
or at the next general term after judgment is entered thereupon. An
action discontinued because the answer set forth matter showing that
the tit.le to real property came in question, and afterwards prosecuted
in another court, is not deemed to have been commenced in the court
wherein the answer was interposed, within the meaning of this subdivision. 
3. An appeal cannot be taken from a jndgment, or from an order
~nting ~r refnsiu~ a new trial, except in an ac_t.ion or special. p~eed­ 
mg aff'ectmg the title to real property, or an interest therein, 1f the
matter in controversy, excluding costs, is less than five hundred dollars;
unless the court. below, by an order made at the general term which
rendered the determination, or at the next general term after judgment
is entered thereupon, allows the appeal, on the ground that a question
of law is involved, which on~ht to be reviewed by the court of appeals. 
If an appeal is taken, by the plaintiff, from a judgment rendered in
an action not founded upon a contract, the sum for which the complaint
demands judgment., or, if the action is to recover one or more chattels,
the value of the chattels, as stated in the complaint, is deemed to be
the amount of the matter in controversy, within the last subdivision,
unless the defendant has interposed a. counterclaim ; in which case the
counterclaim must be included, in determining the amount in con·
troversy. 
§ 192. An appeal from an order, under subdivision second of the last section but one, except an order which in effect determines the action
and prevents a final judgment, or discontinues the action, or grants or
refuses a new trial upon a case or exceptions, may be noticed for
hearing on a motion day, and beard as a. motion. 
§ 193. The court may from time to time make, alter, and amend, 
rules, not inconsistent with the Constitution or statutes of the State,
regulating the practice and proceedings in the court, and the admission 
of attorneys and counsellors at law, to practice in all the courts of record 
or \he State. 
§ 194. The judgment or order of the court of appeals must be re- 
mitted to the court below, to be enforced according to law. Upon an:;~:~
appeal from an order granting a new trial, on a case or exceptions, if 
the court of appeals determines that no error was committed in grant-
ing the new trial, it must render judgment absolute upon the right of 
the appellant ; and after its judgment has been remitted to the court
below, an aseeesment of damages, or any other proceeding, requisite to 
render the judgment effectual, may be had in the latter court.
§ 195. Upon a· second and each subsequent appeal, including a case 
where a former appeal has been dismissed for a defect or irregularity, 
the time of filing the return, upon the first appeal, determines the
place of the cause upon the calendar. 
§ 196. The terms of the court of appeals must be appointed to be
held, at such times and places 88 the court thinks proper, and con-
iinued as long as the public interest requires. 
§ 197. A term of the court may beappointed to be held in a building,
other than that designated by law for holding courts. A term may be

by the. stenographer, and shall not become a county charge. 
§ 256. Ea.ch justice of the supreme court for the. second judicial dis-
trict, who does not reside in the couuty of Kings, must appoint, and 
may at pleasure remove, a stenographer, who must attend, as directed
by the justice appointing him, the general and special terms of the 
supreme court, and the terms of the circuit court and court of oyer
and terminer, held in the counties of Suffolk, Queens, Richmond, West-
chester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, or Orange, and, when not thus
officially engaged, the stated terms of the county court, in each of those 
counties. 
§ 257. Each stenographer, appointed as prescribed in the last section,
is entitled to a salary fixed by law. To make up and pay the salaries,
the board of supervisors of each of the said counties must annually 
levy, and cause to be collected, as a county charge, a proportionate part
of the sum necessary to pay the same, to be fixed by the Comptroller
of the State, in accordance with the amount of the taxable real and
personal property in each county, as shown by the last annual assess­ 
ment-roll therein. The treasurer of each county must pay over the
sum so raised, to the Comptroller of the State, who must thereupon PJtY
the salary of each stenographer, in equal quarterly payments, under
the direction of the justice making the appointment. 
§ 258. The justdces of the supreme court, or a majority of them, for
each judicial district of the State, except the first and second, must 
appoint, and may at pleasure remove, a. stenographer of the supreme 
court in that district. The justices of .the supreme court for the third
judicial district, or a majority of them, may, in their discretion, 
appoint, and at pleasure remove, an additional stenographer, of the
supreme court in that district. Each stenographer, so appointed, is
entitled to a salary fixed by law, to be paid as prescribed in the next section. He must attend, within the judicial district, the terms of the
circuit courts and courts of oyer and termiuer, aud the special terms
of the supreme court, where issuee of fact are triable. 
§ 259. The clerk of the county, in which a term of a court. specified
in the last section. is held, must furnish the stenographer attending 
the same, with a certificate of the number of days the. term has been 
U h
in session. pon t e certifica~s so furnished, the supreme court, at a 
special term thereof held within the judicial district, may, not oftener
than once in six months, by order, apportion to each county in the
district, such a proportion of the stenographer's salary, as the number
of days during which one or more terms were in session in that county,
bears to the whole number of days, during which the terms were in
session in that district, since the last apportionment was made. Upon
the presentation of a certified copy of such an order, each county
treasurer must pay to the stenographer, from the court fund, or the
fund from which jurors are paid, the sum so apportioned to his county. 
§ 260. Each of those stenographers is also entitled to payment of his
actual and necessary expenses, while attending court, including station­
ery, and ten cents for each mile for his actual travel, between the place
of holding each term and his residence, going and returning, or from 
term to term, as the case may be. The amount thereof must be cer­
tified by the judge holding or presiding at the term, and must be paid,
upon bis certificate, by the treasurer of the county where the term is
held, from the court fund, or the fund from which jurors are paid.
But mileage shall not be computed beyond the bounds of the judicial
district, except where the usual line of travel, from one point to another
within that district, passes partly through another judicial district. 
§ 261. Where two or more terms, at which the stenographer would
be required to attend, by the provisions of section two hundred and 
fifty-eight of this act, are appointed to be held at the same time, the
justices of the supreme court, assigned to hold or preside at the same,
may designate the term at which the stenographer for the district mus!
attend, . and may employ an additional stenographer to attend each
other term. In that case, they must, by a certificate signed by them,
fix a reasonable sum for the payment of bis services and actual neces­
sary expenses, to and from, and while attending the term. The sum
so fixed must be paid by the treasurer of the county, upon the certifi­
cate, from the court fund, or the fund from which jurors are paid; and
the number of days, during which that term was in session, shall not
be taken into account, in ma.king an a.pportionmeut of salary, as pre­
scribed in section two hundred and fifty-nine of this act. 
§ 262. Where an official stenographer, or his assiatant, is not in
attendance, at a term of the circuit court, or court of oyer and terminer, 
or at a special term of the supreme court, where issues of fact are tri­
able, the judge holding or presiding at the term, may, in his discretion,
em_ploy a stenographer, who must be paid such a compensation, as the
judge fixes by his certificate, not exceeding ten dollars for each day's
attendance, and ten cents for each mile, for travel to and from his
residence, to the place where the term is held, together with a reason­
able sum for stationery. The sum so fixed is a charge upon the county,
in which the term is held, and the county treasurer must pay it, upon
the judge's certificate, from the court fund, or the fund from which
jurors are paid. If it was the duty of an official stenographer, or his
assistant, to attend the term, and it does not appear to the satisfaction
of the judge, that the failure to attend was excusable, the jndge may,
in bis discretion, during or after the adjournment of the term, make 
an order that the sum so paid, or any part thereof, be deducted from
the salary of the official stenographer, and that the county have such
credit therefor, as justice requires. Such an order may be revoked by
the judge who made it, upon proof by affidavit, that the failure to
attend was excusable.

drnnkenness ; and to any special proceeding which the supreme court

where the special proceeding is brought for such a purpose, or under
such circumstances that the superior city court would have jurisdiction

the terms of subdivision first of this section. 
§ 264. For the purpose or determining the jurisdiction or a superior 
city court, in a case specified in the last section, a domestic corporation 
or joint stock association, whose principal place or business is estab- 
lished, by or pursuant to a. statute, or by its articles of association, or is
actually located, within the city wherein the court is located, is deemed 
a resident of that city; and personal service of a summons, made
within that city, as prescribed in this act, or personal service of a man- 
date, whereby a special. proceeding is commenced, made within that 
city, as prescribed in this act for personal service of a summons, is suf-
ficient service thereof upon a domestic corporation, wherever it is
located. 
§ 265. Where an action or a special proceeding is brought against
two or more parties, and tbe jurisdiction of a superior city court
depends upon the residence of a party, within the city wherein the 
conrt is located; or personal service upon him, within that cit,y, of the

ceeding; or the levying of a warrant of attachment within that city;
and jurisdict.iou is thus acquired as against one or more, but not as
against all of them, t.he jurisdiction, with respect to the others, is gov-
erned by the following rules: 
1. Where the action or special proceeding is founded upon a con­ 
tract, upon which two or more persons are jointly liable, and the court
has or acquires jurisdiction thereof, as against one of them, it has juris­
diction thereof as against all the persons so jointly liable. But this subdivision does not extend to a. case, where the liability is several, as
well as joint. 
2. Where an action or a special proceeding brought against a public
officer, together with one or more private persons, is founded upon an
official act or omission; or where an action or a special proceeding

has or acquires jurisdiction thereof, as against the public officer or the
corporation ; it has jurisdiction thereof as against all persons, who are
necessary parties to the complete determination of the controversy. 
3. Where it is not necessary to the complete determination of the
controversy, that all the parties thereto should be subjected to the juris­
diction of the court, the action or· special proceediug may be discon­ 
tinned or dismlssed, as to the parties over whom the court has not
jurisdiction, and proceed as to the others, as if they were the only par­
ties against whom it was brought. 
§ 266. The jurisdiction of a superior city court, in an action or a
special proceeding brought therein, must always be presumed. It is 
t
, th . l . t  h ti . th 
not necessary to se tor m a comp am 111 sue au ac ion, or m e
petition or other statement of the case in such a special proceeding, any 
of the jurisdictional facts specified in section two hundred and sixty-
three of this act ; and where the defendant in the action, or the person
against whom the special proceeding is instituted, appears, the want
of jurisdiction, by reason of the non-existence or any of those facts, is
matter of def ence, and is waived by the appearance, unless it is 
pleaded in defence.
§ 267. Where a superior city eonrt has jurisdiction of an action or 
special proceeding, it posseesee the same jurisdiction, authority, aud
power, in and over the same, and in the course of the proceedings 
therein, whic! the supreme court po.ssesses in a like cas~; and .it may
render any Judgment, or· grant either party any rehef, which the 
supreme court might render or grant in a like case, and may enforce
its mandates in like manner as the supreme court. And each ju~e 
of the superior city court possesses the same power and authority, m
the action or special proceeding, which a justice of the supreme court
possesses, in a like action or special proceeding, brought in the supreme
court. 
§ 268. Each judge of a superior city court also possesses the same
power and authority, in a special proceeding', which can be )awfully 
instituted before him, out of court, which a juetice of the supreme
court possesses in a like special proceeding, instituted before him in 
like manner.
§ 269. The supreme court may, by an order, made at any time after 
joinder of an issue of fact, and before the trial thereof, remove to itself
an action or a special proceeding pending in a superior city court, for 
the purpose of changing the place of trial or hearing thereof. Where
an order for a removal is made, as prescribed in this section, the place
of trial or hearing must be changed by the same order to another
county. A certified copy of the order must be filed in the office of the
clerk of the court, in which the action or special proceeding was com­
menced. Thereupon it is removed into the supreme eourt ; and the
subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if it had been
oriBi:nally brought in the supreme court. 
§ 270. An order for the removal of an action or special proceeding,
as prescribed in the last, section, can be made only upon notice, and
by a special term of the supreme court, where the motion might be 
made, if the action or special proceeding was pendin~ in the supreme
court, and brought in the county where the snpenor city court is
located ; and in a case, where an order, changing in like manner the
place of trial or hearing, would be granted, if the action or special
proceeding was pending in the supreme court. 
§ 271. An appeal from an order, made upon such a motion, must be
taken and heard in like manner, as if the action or special proceeding 
was pending in the supreme court, and triable in the county from which
the place of trial is changed. Such an appeal brings up t.o the ,z-eneral 
term, and thence to the court of appeals, if the order is appealable to 
that court, all questions which were before the special term, and the
appellate tribunal must dispose of the same, as if they were originally 
presented to it.
§ 272. An order to stny proceedings, for the purpose of affording an 
opportunity to make such an application for removal, may be made by
a. judge, authorized to make au order to stay proceedings, either in
the court where the action or special proceedin~ is pending, or in the 
RUfreme court, and with like effect, and under hke circumstances.
§ 273. If all the judges of a superior city court are, for any reason, 
incapable of Hitting upon the. trial of an action, or the hearing of a.
special proceedin~ pending therein, or if all, or all but one, of the
judges of a supenor city court are incapable of sitting upon the hear­ 
ing of an appeal therein, the judges of the court, or a majority of them,
must make and file in the office of the clerk of the court a certificate
of the fact. Thereupon the action or special proceeding is removed to
the supreme court; and the subsequent proceedings therein must be
the same as if it had been originally brought in the supreme court. 
§ 274. The supreme court, where the parties manifest in writing
their consent, must make an order directing that an action or special
proceeding, pending in that court and triable in a county where a 
81lperior city court is located, be removed to the superior city court, or,
in the city of New York; to either of those courts therein, as specified 
in the consent. A certified copy of the order must be filed in the office 
or the clerk of the court to which the action or special proceeding is
ordered to be removed. Thereupon it is removed aceordin~ly; and all
subsequent proceedings therein must be the same as if It had been
or~nally brought in the superior cit,y court. 
§ 275. Where an action or special proceeding is removed from one
court to another, as prescribed in this article, the clerk of the court 
from which it is removed must forthwith deliver to the clerk of the
court to which it is removed all papers filed therein, and certified 
copies of all minutes and entries relating thereto, which must be filed,
entered, or recorded, as the case requires, in the office of the last men-
tioned clerk. If the action or special proceeding is removed to the
supreme court, and the place of trial or hearing changed, the delivery
must be made to the clerk of the county in which the order of removal
direets the trial or hearing to be had. 
§ 276. The removal of an action or special proceeding, as prescribed
in this article, does not invalidate or in any manner impair, a process, 
provisional remedy, or other proceeding, or a bond, undertaking, or
rec~izance, in the action or special proceeding 80 removed i each of 
which continues to have the same validity and effect as if the removal
had not been made. Where bail has been given, the surrender of the
defendant in the court to which the action or special proceeding was
removed, has the same effect as a surrender in the court from which it
was removed would have had if the action or special proceeding had
remained therein. 
§ 277. In an action or special proceeding brought in a superior city
court, an order may be made without notice, or an order to stay pro- 
ceedings may be made upon notice by the county judge of the county
where the court ia situated, or of the county where the attorney for the 
applicant resides, in a case where a jud~ of the superior city court
~M make the same out of court, and with like effect. 
§ 278. A superior city court has power, in an action or special pro-
ceediog of which it has jurisdiction, to send its process and other man- 
dates into any county of the State, for service or execution, and to enforce
obedience thereto, with like power and authority as the supreme court. 
§ 279. A special proceeding, instituted before a judge of the supe-
rior court of Buffalo, or the city court of Brooklyn, or a proceeding 
commenced before a judge of either of those courts, out of court, in an
action or special proceeding pending in his court, may be continued, 
from time to time, before one or more other judges of the same court,
as prescribed by law, with respect to like proceedings, before a judge 
of a court or record in the city of New York.
§ 280. The judges of each superior city court, or a majority of them, 
must, from time to time, appoint the times for holding the ~eneral,
special and trial terms of their court. They must also e.ss1gn the 
judges to hold each or the terms, and desirate the trial terms at
which i88ues of fact are triable by a jury. general, a special, and 
· one or more trial terms, may be appointed to be held, and may be held,
at the same time. The judges, or a. majority of them, must also
appoint reasonable times, when a judge must attend at chambers, and
deiiignate the judge to attend for that purpose. Each appointment,
made as prescribed in this section, m~ be signed by the judges
making the sa.me, and filed· in the clerks office. A copy thereof must 
Gl 
be published in the newspaper printed in Albany, ia · whieh legal
notices are required to be published, and hi two newspapers prinf.ed
in the city where the conrt is located, at least once in each week· for
ihree successi ve .weeks, before a term is held by virtue thereof. : . 
§ 281. A general term of a superler city court must· be held by ai
least two judges. Two mnst concur to determine a cause; otherwise, 
it must be reheard; except that if the remaining judge or judges a.re 
disqualified to sit upon an appeal, ihe judgment or order appealed
from must be affirmed, unless a rehearing is directed. 
§ 282. A special term or a trio.I term of a superior city court moat be
held by one judge. ,

book of minutes, records, indiees, or dockets of judgments, in the offi.oe
of the olerk of the court, has become so mutilated or injured, that it 
cannot be . conveniently used or correctly examined, the clerk of the 
court muai cause a copy thereof to be made. The expense of making
the copy, not exceeding ten cents for each folio, is a charge, in the city
of New York, upon that city, and, in the city of Buffalo, or the city of
Brooklyn, upon the county where the court is located ; and it must be
paid by the comptroller of the city of New York, or the county treas­
urer, as the case requires, upon the certificate of the clerk, that the
copy was made pursuant to bis direction. The copy, when certified
by the clerk to be a correct copy of the original, has, presumptively,

§ 314. The jurisdietion of the marine court of the city of New York
extends to the following cases : · 
1. An action against a natural person, or against a foreign or domes­

of money only, or to recover one or more chattels, with or without
da.maires for the taking or detention thereof. 
2. .!n action to foreclose or enforce a lien upon real property in the 
city of New· York, created, M prescribed by statute, in favor of a per­
son, who has performed labor upon, or furnished materials to be used

improved, a lot of land, or the sidewalk or street in front of or adjoin­
ing a lot of land. 
3. An action to foreclose or enforce a lien, for a sum not exceeding
two thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, upon one or more chattels. 
4. The ta.king and entry of a judgment, upon the confession of one
or more defendants, where the sum, for which judgment is confessed,
does not exceed two thousand dollars, exclusive of interest from the
time of making the statement, upon which the judgment is entered. 
§ 316. The jurisdiction conferred by the last section is subjec\ to 
the following limitations and regulations :
1. In an action wherein the complaint demands judgment for a sum 
of money only, the sum, for which judgment is rendered in favor of
the plaintiff, cannot exceed two thousand dollars, exclusive of interest,
and costs as taxed ; except where it is brought upon a bond or under­
taking, given in an action or special proceeding in the ea.me court, or
before a justice thereof; or to recover damages for a breach of promise
of marriage; or where it is a marine cause, as that expression is defined
in the next section. Where the action is brought upon a bond or other
contract, the judgment must be for the sum actually due, without re~
to a penalty therein contained; and, where the money is payable in
instalments, successive actions may be brought for the instalments, aa
they become due. 
2. In an action to recover one or more chattels, a judgD:1ent cannot
be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, for a chattel or chattels, the
aggregate value of which exceeds two thousand dollars. 
8. The court has not jurisdiction of an action commenced &.g!Linst an 
executor or administrator, in his representative cape.city. But thus subdivision does not prevent the court from continuing an action
against an executor or administrat.or, orfrom substituting an executor
or administrator in place of a defendant in an action, in a case where U
is prescribed in this act that a continuance or substitution may be made. 
§ 317. The following actions are styled in this act, marine causes,
and the court possesses the same jurisdiction of such an action, as the
supreme court of the State : ·

voyage, wholly or partly performed, or intended to be performed by it. 
2. An action in favor of or against a person, belonging to or on board
of a vessel in the merchant service, to recover damages for an assault,
battery, or false imprisonment, committed on board the vessel, upon the
high seas, or in a place without the United States. 
But this section does not confer upon the marine court authority to
proceed, as a court of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction. 
§ 318. The court has not, nor has either of the justices thereof, power
to naturalize an alien. 
§ 819. The supreme court, at a term held in the first judicial district,
may, by an order made at any time after joinder of an issne of fact, 
and before the trial thereof, remove to itself an action brought in the
marine court, for the purpose of changing the place of trial thereof.
Where an order for removal is made, as prescribed in this section, the
place of trial must be changed by the same order to another county,
and the subsequent proceedings therein must be the same as if the
action had been originally brought in the supreme court. The provis­
ions of sections three hundred and forty-four, three hundred and fort.y­
five and three bundred and forty-six of this act, apply to an application
to remove such an action, and to the proceedings upon and subeequeut 
to the removal, as if the marine court was specified in those sections in
place of the county court, and a justice thereof in place of the county 
judge. 
§ 320. The court consists of six justices, one of whom is the chief-
justice of the court. Each justice must perform hie share of the labors
and duties appertaining to the office. One of the justices must attend
at the chambers of the eourt, from ten o'clock in the morning until four
o'clock in the afternoon of each day, except Sunday, a public holiday, 
·or a day upon which the inhabitants of the city of New York generally
ref'rain from business. Each justice, while in the rooms of tlie court,
and not actually engaged in the performance of other official duties,
must act upon any application for bis official action, properly made to 
him. The justice, assigned to a trial term or a special term, must
remain in attendance, until the day calendar is disposed of, or for such
other time as is reuonable. 
§ 321. Where it appears presumptively, to the satisfaction of the
Governor, that a justice of the court has been guilty of corruption, or
other gross misconduct in office; or habitually neglects to perform bis
share of the labors and duties appertaining to the office ; or is incapable
of properly discharging the same; the Governor may, in his discretion,
make an order, suspending that justice from the exercise of the duties 
oC his office, and directing that his compensation cease. Such an order
must recite the grounds upon which it is made; and it remains in force,
unless it is sooner revoked by the Governor, until the final adjournment
of the next session of the Legislature ; or, if the Legislature is then in
session, until the final adjournment of that session. 
§ 322. The justices of the court, or a majority of them, must, from
time to time, as a vacancy occurs in the office of chief-justice, desi~nate 
one of their number to be chief-justice. A certificate of the designa-
tion, under the hands of the justices making the same, must be filed
in the office of the clerk of the court. The person so designated shall
be chief-justice during his term of office. The chief-justice has the 
like authority,. within the jurisdiction of the court, as a presiding jus-
tice of the supreme court; and when he.is present and is not disquali-
fied, he must preside at a general term. 
§ 323. The justices of the court, or a majority of them, may, from
time to time,. establish rules of practice for the court, not inconsistent

scribed in section seventeen of this act. The latter govern the practice
in the court, as far as they are applicable thereto. 
§ 324. The court is always open for the transaction of any business,
for which notice is not required to be given to an adverse party. The 
justices or the court, or a majority of them, from time to time must
appoint, and may alter, the times of holding general, special, and trial
terms or the court. They must prescribe the duration of the terms ;
designate the trial terms a.t which jurors a.re required to attend; and
assign the justice or justices to preside and attend, at each of the terms 
appointed. In case of the inability of a justice to preside or attend,
another justice may preside or attend in his place, Each trial and
special term must be held by one justice; and each genera.I term by at
least two justices. Two or more general, special, or trial terms may be
appointed to be held at the same time. The concurrence of two jus-
tices is necessary to pronounce a decision at a general term. If two do 
not concur, a re-argument must be ordered. The justices holding a
general term may order a re-argument, before themselves, or at a sub- 
sequent general term, of a. cause heard bythem, ut at a·previous gen-
eral term. 
§ 825. Each term so appointed must be held at the city-hall in the
city of New-York, except that auxiliary or additional parte.: for the
transaction of any business speeitied in the appointment, may be held
elsewhere within the city of New-York, as designated in the appoint-
ment. An appointment must be published in two newspapers, pub­
lished in the city of New- York, at least once in each week, for three
successive weeks, before a term is held in pursuanee thereof. · 
§ 826. Each of the jusflcee may, within · the city of· New-York;
administer an oath, or take a deposition, or the acknowledgment o:r
proof of the execution of a written instrnment, and certify the same, in 
like manner and with like authority and effect, as a justice of the
supreme court. 
§ 827. In an action brought in the court, an order cannot be made,
or a warrant of attachment granted, by an officer, other than a justice
of the court; and each provision of this act, which empowers an officer,
other than a judge of the court in which an action is brought, to· make
an order therein, must be construed as being exclusive of an action
brought in the marine court. · 
§ 328. The court has a clerk, who is appointed, and may be removed,
at pleasure, by the justices thereof, or a ·majority of them. He must, 
by a. written instrument nnder his hand, tiled in his office, appoint.
and may a.t pleasure remove three deputy-clerks, 'and not more than
ten assistants. The clerk is responsible for the faithful discharge of
his duty, by each deputy clerk and each assistant. The clerk, each
deputy-clerk, and each assistant, is entitled to a salary, fixed and to
be paid as prescribed by law. 
§ 329. The clerk, and also each depnty-clerk, before he enters upon
the duties of his office, must subscribe, and file in the office of the clerk
of the city and county of N"ew York, the Constitutional oath of office. 
The deputy-clerk has all the powers, and may perform· all the duties
of the clerk, when the office of clerk is vacant, or at the clerk's office,
when the clerk is absent therefrom, or at a term or sitting of the court
which the deputy-clerk attends. 
§ 380. The clerk may designate as many of his assistants, M the
justices of the court, or a majority of them, deem necessary, M special
deputy-clerks. Each special deputy-clerk possesses, in the absence of

sitting vr term of the court which he attends, with respect to the busi­
ness transacted thereat. 
§ 331. The clerk must receive, for the use of the city of New York,
the fees allowed by law. He shall not perform any service, for which
a. fee is allowed by law, until the fee therefor is paid to him. He

render to the comptroller of the city an account, under oath, of all fees
received, directly or indirect.ly, during the preceding month, by him,
or by a. deputy-clerk, or either of his assistants, for any official service;
and he must, at the same time, pay the same into the t.reasury of the
city of New York. When the return and payment are so made, the
clerk is entitled to receive his compensation, for the period included
in the return. He is not entitled tocompeusatlon for a period for which
he has not made his return and payment. 
§ 832. The clerk of the court must, appoint three stenographers of

§ 340. The jurisdiction of each county court extends to the following
actions and special proceedings, hL~dgiti~.n to, th~ jurisdiction, power, 
and authority, conferred upon a county court, in a particular ease, by
special statutory provision : 
t. To an action for the partition of real property ; fOT dower ; for
the foreclosure, redemption, or satisfaction of a mortgage upon real
property; or to procure a judgment requiring the specific performance
of a contract, relating to real property; where the real property, to
which the action relates, is situated within the county; or to foreclose
a lien upon a chattel, in a case specified in section seventeen hundred 
and th, i. rt.y-seven of this act, where the lien does not exceed one 
twl~.c\Dllar.s in amount, and the chattel is found within the county.
2. To an action in favor of the executor, administrator or assignee 
of a judgment creditor, or, in a proper case, in favor of the judgment
creditor, to recover a judgment for money remaining due upon a judg-
ment rendered in the same court. 
8. To an action for any other cause, where. the defendant is, or, if
\here are two or more defendants, where all of them are, at the time 
of the commencement of the action, residents of the county, and
wherein the complaint demands judgment for a sum of money only,
not exceeding one tbo1&&:tJd dollaes ; or to recover one or more chattels,
the aggregate value of which does not exceed one thousand dollars,
with or without damages for the taking or detention thereof. 
4. To the cust.ody of the person and the care of the property, con­
currently with the supreme court, of a resident of the county, who is
incompetent to manage his affairs, by reason of lunacy, idiocy, or
habitual drunkenness; and to every special proceeding, which the
supreme court has jurisdiction to entertain, for the appointment of a
committee of the person or of the property, of such an incompetent
person, or for the sale or other disposition of the real property, situated
within the county, of a person, wherever resident, who is so incompe­
tent for either of the causes aforesaid, or who is an infant; or for the
aale or other disposition of the real property, situated within the
county, of a domestic religious corporation. 
§ 341. For the purpose of determinintf the jnri8diction of a county
court, in either of the cases specified m the 188t section, a domestic 
corporation or joint-stock association, whose principal place of business 
is established, by or pursuant to a statute, or by its articles of 8880Cio.-
tion, or is actually located within the county, is deemed a resident of 
the county, and personal service of a summons, made within the county,
as prescribed in this act, or personal service of a mandate, whereby a 
special proceeding ie commenced, made within the county, 88 prescribed
in this act f or personal service of a summons, is sufficient service
thereof opon a domestic corporation, wherever it is located. 
§ 842. If the county judge is, for any cause, incapable to act in an
action or special proceeding, pending in the county court, or before
him, he must make, and file in the office of the clerk, a certificate of 
the fact; and thereupon the special county judge, if any, and if not
disqualified, must act 88 county judge in that action or special pro- 
ceeding. Upon the filing of the certificate, where there is no special
county judge, or the special county judge is disqualified, the action or
special proceeding is removed to the supreme court, if it is then pend-
ing in the county conrt; if it is pending before the county judge, it
may be continued before any justice of the supreme court within the
same judicial district. The supreme court, npon 'the application of
either party, made upon notice, and upon proof that t.he county jndge 
is incapable to act in an action or special proceeding pending in the
county court, may, and if the special county judge is also incapable 
to act, must make an order removing it to the supreme conrt. There-
upon the subsequent proceedings in the supreme court must be the
same ae if it bad originally been brought in that court, except that an
objection to the jurisdiction may be taken, which might have been taken 
in the conn ty court. 
§ 343. The supreme court may, by an order, made at any time after 
JOmder of an 188Ue o act, an tore e ria ereo , remove 
itself an action, brought in a coun~ court, under subdivision second
or subdivision third of the last section but two, for the purpose of
changing the place of trial thereof. Where an ord~r for removal. ie 
made aR prescribed in this section, the place of tnal of the action 
must be changed by the Bame order to another oounty; and the sub- 
sequent proceedings therein must be -the 88.JD.e, as if the action bad
been originaliy brought in the supreme court. 
§ 344. An order of removal, made as prescribed in either of the last
two sections, takes effect upon the entry thereof in the office of the 
county clerk. Where the order directs that the action be tried in an-
other county, the clerk with whom it is entered, must forthwith deliver 
to the clerk· of that county, all papers filed therein, and certified copies
of all minutes and entries relating thereto; which must be filed, en­
tered, or recorded, as the case requires, in the office of the last men­
tioned clerk. The provisions of section two hundred and seventy-one
of this act apply to an appeal taken from such an order. 
§ 845. An order to stay proceedings, for the purpose of affording an
opportunity to make the application for removal, may be made by the
county judge, or by a judge authorized to make such an order in the
supreme court, and with like effect and under like circumstances. 
§ 346. The removal of an action or special proceeding, as prescribed
in this title, ees not invali ate, or in any manner impair, a process,
provisional remedy, or other proceeding, or a bond, undertaking, or 
recognize.nee in the action or special proceeding so removed ; each· of
whion continues to have the same validity and effect, as if the removal
bad not been made. Where bail was given, the surrender of the
defendant in the supreme court has the same efftd, as a surrender in
the county court would have had, if the action or special proceeding
had remained therein. 
§ 347. A county court bas power, in an action or- special proceeding
of which it has jurisdiction, to send its process and other mandates into 
8.D.J..co.uJlcy' .of the State, for service or execution, and to enforce obe­
dience thereto, with iike power and authority as the supreme court. 
§ 848. Where a county court has jurisdiction of an action or a special
proceeding, it possesses the same jurisdiction, power and authority in
and over the same, and in the course of the proceedings therein, which
the supreme court possessee in a like case; and it may render any judg­
ment, or grant either party any relief, which the supreme court mi~ht
render or grant in a like case, and may enforce its mandates in like
manner as the supreme court. And the county judge possesses the
same power and authority, in the action or special proceeding, which a
justice of the supreme court possesses, in a like action or special pro­
ceeding, brought in the supreme court. 
§ 349. The county judge also possesses the same power and authority,
in a special proceeding, which can be lawfully instituted before him,
out of court, which a justice of the supreme court possesses in a like
special proceeding", instituted before him in like manner. 
§ 350. Upon the application of a person, who has been fined by a
court, or of a person whose recognizance has become forfeited, or of his
surety, the county court of the county in which the term of the court
was held, where the fine was imposed, or the recognizance taken,
may, except as otherwise prescribed in the next section, upon good
cause shown, and upon such terms as it deems just, make an order,
remitting the fine, wholly or partly, or the forfeiture of the recognizance,
or part of the penalty thereof; or it may discharge the recognizance.
U a fine so remitted has been paid, the county treasurer, or other officer,
in whoee hands the money remains, must pay the same, or the pa.rt
remitted, according to the order. 
§ 351. The last section does not authorize a county court, to remit
any part of a. fine, exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, imposed 
1 a co o oyer an termmer, or a cou o seasons, upon a convic-
ijon for a criminal offence; or a fine, to any amount, imposed by a court 
npon an officer or other person, for an actual contempt of court, or for
disobedience to its process, or other mandate; or to remit or discharge
a recognizance, taken in its county, for the appearance of a person in
another county. In the latter case, the power of remitting or discharg-
ing the recognizance is vested in the county court of the county, in
which the person is bound' to appear. 
§ 352. An application for an order, as prescribed in the last section
but one, cannot be heard, until such notice thereof as the conrt deems 
reasonable, bas been given to the district-attorney of the county, and
unt-il be has bad an opportunity to examine the matter, and prepare to
resist the application. And upon granting such an order, the court
must always impose, as a condiction* thereof, the payment of the costs 
and expenses, if any, incurred in an action or special proceeding for 
the collection of the fine, or the penalty of the recognizance. 
§ 853. Where a person has been fined by a court of special sessions,IFinee
or by a justice of the peace, upon a conviction for an offence, and baf/f;s~T~~f 
been committed to jail for non-payment of the fine, the county conrf.~
of the county may make an order, remitting the fine, wholly or partly, 
and discharging him from his imprisonment. The power conferred by.'
this section must be exercised in the manner prescribed, and subject t<1,
the provisions contained, in the last tbree sections.
§ 854. In an action or special proceeding in a county court, an order 
may be made without notice, or an order to stay proceedings may 
be made upon notice, by a justice of the supreme court, OT by the
county judge of the county where the attorney for the applicant resides., 
in a. case where the county judge, in whose court the action or special·
proceeding is brought, may make the same, out of court; and with
like effect. 
§ 355. The county court is always open for the transaction of any
business, for which notice is not required to be given to an adverse 
party, except where it is specially prescribed by law, that the business
must be done at a stated· term. The county judge must, from time to 
time, appoint the times and places for holding terms of his court. At
least two terms, for· the trial of issues of law or of fact, must be ap-
pointed to be held in each year. Each term may contine as long as the 
county judge deems necessary. The county judge may, by a new
appointment, change the day appointed for holding a term, or appoint
one or more additional terms, or dispense with the holding of a term,
without affecting any other- term or terms theretofore appointed to be
held. Each term must be held at the place designated by statute for
that purpose; except that the county judge may, fmm time to time,
adjourn a term to any place within the county, for the hearing and
decision of motions and appeals, and trials and other proceedings
without a jury; and may appoint as many terms as he thinks proper
to be held, either at the court house or elsewhere in the county, for the 
same purpose.
§ 356. Each appointment, made as prescribed in the last section( 
must he filed in the county clerk's office, and a. copy thereof published;
at least once in each week, for three successive weeks before a t.erm is 
held, 'changed, Ol' dispensed with, by virtue thereof, in the newspaper 
in the city of Albany, in which legal notices are required to be pub- 
,lished, and also m at least one newspaper, published in the county, and
as many additional newspapers, published therein, as the county judge 
~prescribes. The expense of the publication is a. county charge.
§ 857. J nrors for the terms of the county court, at which issues of 
fact are triable by jury, and of the court of sessions, must be drawn
and notified in the same manner as for a term of the circuit court. 
§ 858. The board of supervisors of any county, except Kings, Liv-
f te 
ingstou, and Monroe, may provide for the employment o a s nog-
rapher for the county court and court of sessions thereof, and must fix 
his compensation, and provide for the payment thereof, in the same
manner as other county expenses are paid. 
§ 359. The connty judge of the county of Kings, from time to time
must appoint, and may at pleasure remove, a stenographer, to be at­
tached to the county court, and the court of sessions, of the county of
Kings, who is entitled to a salary, fixed and to be paid as prescribed by
law. He must attend each trial of an issue of fact in the county court or 
court of sessions. The stenographer appointed as prescribed in this section, may, with the consent of the county judge, appoint an assist­
ant stenographer to aid him in the discharge of hit' duties, whose com­
pensation shall be paid by the stenographer, and is not a county charge. 
§ 360. The county judge and the surrogate of the county of Kings,
from time to time, must appoint, and may at pleasure remove, an in­ 
terpreter, to be attached to the county court, the court of sessions, and
the surrogate's court of the county of Kings. Before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, he must file in the county clerk's office the con­ 
stitutional oath of office, and an additional oath, which may be incor­
porated into the constitutional oath, to the effect that he will fully and
correctly interpret and translate each question propounded to a witne88
and each answer thereto. 
§ 861. The judge holding or rresiding at a term of the county court
or court of sessions, in either o the counties of Livingston, Niagara or 
Monroe, where issues of fact are triable, may employ a stenographer 
to take stenographic notes upon trials thereat, who is entitled to a com­
pensatio~, to be certified by the judge, not exceeding ten dollars for 
each days attendance, at the request of the judge. The stenographer's
compensation is a charge upon the county, and, in the counties of Liv­
ingston and Niagara must be audited, allowed and paid e.s other county
charges ; and in the county of Monroe must be paid by the county
treasurer on an order of the court, granted on the affidavit of the
stenographer and the certificate of the judge, that the services were 
rendered.

§ 387. An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, given
wholly or partly to any person who will prosecute for the same, must 
be commenced within one year after the commission of the offence ;
and if the action is not commenced within the year by a private per- 
son, it may be commenced within two years thereafter, in behalf of
the people of the State, by the Attorney-General, or the district-attor-
ney of the county where the offence was committed. 
§ 388. An action, the limitation of which is not specially prescribed
in this or the last title, must be commenced within ten years after the
cause of action accrues. 
§ 389. The limitations, prescribed in this title, apply alike to actions
brought in the name of the people of the State, or for their benefit, and 
to actions by private persons. 
§ 890. Where a cause of action, which does not -involve the title to 
or possession of real property within. the State, accrues against a per­
son, who is not .theu a resident of the State, an action cannot be brought 
thereon in a court of the State, against him or his personal represeuta­
tive, after the expiration of the time, limited., by the laws of his resi­ 
denee, for .bringing a. like action, except by a resident of the St.ate, 
and in one of the following cases : 
1. Where the ~use of action originally accnied in favo'r of a resi­
dent of the State. 
2. Where, before the expiration of the time so limited, the person,
in whose favor it originally accrued, was or . became a resident of Ute
State ; or the cause -of action was assigned to, and thereafter continu­
ously owned by, a resiclent of the State. 
§ 891. If a person, against whom a cause of action exists, dies with­
out the State, the time which elapees between his death, and the expira­
tion of eighteen months after the issuing, within the State, of letters 
~ta.m.entary or letters of administ.ra.tion, is not a part of the \ime
limited for the eommencemeat or an action therefor, against his execu­
tor or administrator. 
§ 802. For the purpose of com.puting the time, within which an
actien must be commenced in a court of the State, by an executor or 
administrator, to recover personal property, taken after the death of a 
testator or intestate, and before the iss.ui~ of letters testamentary or
letters of administration ; or to recover damages for taking, detaining 
or injuring personal property within the same period ; the letters are
deemed to have been issued within six years after the death of the tes­
tator or intestate. But where an action is barred by this section, any
of the next of kin, legatees, or creditors, who, at the time of the trans­ 
action upon which it might have been founded, was within the age of 
twenty-one years, or insane, or imprisoned on a criminal charge, may~
within five years after the cessation of 11uc1l a disability, maintain an
action to recover damages by reason thereof: in which he may recovee 
such sum, or the value of such property, as he would have received
upon the fi.naJ distribution of the estate, if an actlon had been seeson­ 
§ 394. This chapter does not affect an action against a director or
stockholder of a moneyed corporation, or banking a.seociation, to recover 
ably commenced by the executor or administrator. 
§ 398. Thia chapter does not affect an action to enforce the payment
of a bill, note, or other evidence of debt, issued by a moneyed corpora- 
tion, or issueti or put in circulation as meney. 
a penalty or forfeiture Imposed, or to enforce a liability created by law;
bnt such an aciloa must oe broll&'ht within three years after the cause
of action baa accrued. 
§ 395. An acknowledgment or promise, contained in a writing signecl 
by the party to be charged thereby, is the only competent evidence ()f
a new or continuing contract, whereby to take a ease out of the opera- 
tion of this title. 'But this section does not alter the effect of a. pay- 
ment of principal or interest. 
§ 396. If a person, entitled to maintain an action specified in thls title, except for a periaJty or forfeiture, or against a sheriff or other
officer for an escape, is, at the time when the cause of action accraee, 
either:

cannot be extended more than five years by any such disability, excep 
iafancy ; or, in any case, more than one ~a.r.a!t.~r the disability ceases.

§ 898. An action is commenced. against a delenaant, within the
ineaning of any provision ot this act, which limits the time for com-
mencmg an action, when the -summons is served on Lim ; or, on a 
oo-defendant who is a joiBt contractor, or otherwise united in intereut 
with him.
§ 399. An attempt to commence an action, in a court of record, is 
equivalent to the commencement thereof against each defendant,
'Within the meaning of each provision of tbiB act, which limits the time
for commencing an action, when the summons is delivered, with the 
intent that it shall be actually served, to the sheriff', or, where the
sheriff is a party, to a coroner of the county, in which that defendant 
or one of two or more co-defendants, who are joint contractors, or other-
wise united in interest with him, resides or la&t resided; or, if the
defendant is a corporation, to a like officer of the county, in which it is 
established by law, or wherein its general businesa is or was last trans-
acted, or wherein it keeps or last kept, an office for the transaction of
business. But in order to entitle a plaintiff to the benefit of this sec-
tion, the delivery of the summons to an officer must be followed, within 
6i.xty days after the expiration of the time limited for the actual com­
mencement of the action, by personal service thereof upon the defend- 
ant sought to be charged, or by the first publication of the summons, 
as against that defendant, pursuant to an order for service upon him
in that manner. 
§ 400. The last section, excluding the provision requiring a publica-
tion or service of the summons within sixty days, applies to an attempt 
to commence an action in a. court not of record. where the summons is
delivered to an officer authorized to serve the same, within the city or 
t.own wherein the person resides or the corporation is located, as speci­
fied in that section; provided that actual service thereof is made with 
due diligence.
§ 401. If, when the cause of action accrues against a person, he is 
without the State, the action may be commenced within the time lim­
ited therefor, after his return into the State. If, after a cause of action 
bas accrued against a person, he departs from and resides without the
State, or remains continuously absent therefrom for the space of one
year or more, the time of bis absence is not a part of thE, time, limited
for the commencement of the action. But this section does not apply
while a designation made as prescribed in section four hundred and
thirty, or in subdivision second of section four hundred and thirty.two
of this act remains in force. 
§ 402. If a person, entitled to maintain an action, dies before the ex­
piration of the time limited for the commencement thereof, and the cause 
of action survives, an action may be commenced by his representative,
aftAr the expiration of that time, aud within one year after his death. 
§ 408. The term of eighteen months after the death, within the
State, of a person, against whom a cause of action exists, is not a part 
of the time limited for the commencement of an action against bis
executor or administrator. If letters testamentary or letters of admin­
istration upon bis estate are not issued, within the State, at least six
months before the expiration of the time to bring the action, as extended
by the foregoing provision of this section, the term of one year after
such letters are issued, is not & part of the time limited for the com­
mencement of such an action. 
§ 404. Where a. person is disabled to sue in the courts of the State,
by reason of either party being an alien subject or citizen of a country
at war with the United States, the time of the continuance of the disa­
bility is not a part of the time limited for the commencement of the 
action. 
§ 405. If an action is commenced within the time limited therefor,
and a. judgment therein is reversed on appeal, without awarding a new 
trial, or the action is terminated in any other manner than by a volun-
tary discontinuance, a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to pros­ 
ecute the action, or a final judgment upon the merits; the plaintiff, or,
if he dies, and the cause of action survives, his representative may 
commence a new action for the same cause, after the expiration of the
time so limited, and within one year after such a reversal or termination. 
§ 406. Where the commencement of an action bas been stayed by
injunction, or by other order of a court or judge, or by statutory prohibi­ 
tion, the time of the continuance of the stay is not a part of the time,
limited for the commencement of the action. 
§ 407. Where an injury results from the act or omission of a deputy
or agent, the time, within which an action to recover damages by reason 
thereof, must be commenced by the principal, against the deputy or
agent, must be computed from the time, when a judgment against the 
principal, for the act or omission, is first recovered by the aggrieved
person; and & subsequent reversal or setting aside of the judgment 
does not extend the time. 
74 
§ 408. A person cannot avail himself of a disability unlesa it existed
when bis right of action or of entry accrued. 
§ 409. Where two or more disabilities co-exist, when the right of
action or of entry accrues, the limitation does not attach, until all are 
removed. 
§ 410. Where a right exists, but a. demand is necessary to entitle a
person to maintain an action, the time, within which the action must 
be commenced, must be computed from the time, when the right to
make the demand is complete; except in one of the following cases : 
t. Where the right grows out of the receipt or detention of money
or property, by an agent, trustee, attorney, or other person acting in 8, 
fiduciary capacity, the time must be computed from the time, when the
person, having the right to make the demand, has actual knowledge of.
the facts, upon which that right depends. 
2. Where there was a deposit of money, not to be repaid at a fixed
time, but only upon a special demand, or a delivery of personal prop­
erty, not to be returned, specifically or in kind, at a fixed time or upon
a fixed contingency, the time must be computed from the demand. 
§ 411. Where the persons, who might be adverse parties in an action,
have entered into a written agreement to submit to arbitration, or to 
refer the cause of action, or a controversy in which it might be avail-
able, or have entered into a written submission thereof to arbitrators;
and before an award, or other determination thereupon, the agreemeut
or submission is revoked, so as to render it ineffectual, by the death of
either party thereto, or by the a.ct of the person against whom· the
action might have been brought; or the execution thereof, or ihe
remedy upon an award or other determination thereunder, is stayed by
injunction, or other order procured by him from a competent court or
judge ; the time which bas elapsed, between the entering into the
written submission or agreement, and the revocation thereof, or the ex-
piration of the stay, is not a part of the time, limited for the com­
mencement of the action. 
§ 412. Where a defendant in an action has interposed an answer, in
support of which he would be entitled to rely, at the trial, upon a de- 
fence or counterclaim then existing in his favor, the remedy upon which,
at the time of the commencement of the action, was not barred by the 
provisions of this chapter; and the complaint is dismissed, or the action
is discontinued, or abates in consequence of the plaintiff's death; the
time which intervened, between the commencement and the termina-
tion of the action, is not a. part of the time, limited for the commence-
ment of an action by the defendant, to recover for the cause of action
so interposed as a defence, or to interpose the same defence in another
action brought by the same plaintiff, or a. person deriving title from or 
under him.
§ 413. The objection, that the action was not commenced within tlHow 
time limited, can be taken only by answer. The corresponding obje
tion to a defence or counterclaim can be taken only by reply ; exce 
where a reply is not required, in order to enable the plaintiff to rais 
an issue of fact, upon an allej,f&tion contained in the answer.
§ 414. The provisions of this chapter apply, and constitute the only 
rules of limitation applicable, to a civil action or special proceeding,
except in one of the following cases: 
1. A case, where a different limitation is specially prescribed by law,
or a shorter limitation is prescribed by the written contract of the 
2. A eal18e ot action or a defence which accrued before the first day
of July, eighteen hundred and forty-eight. The statutes then in force 
govern, with respect to such a cause of action or delence.
S. A-case, not included in the last subdivision, in which a person is 
entitled, when this act takes effect, to commence an action, or to insti­
tute a special proceedin~, or to take any proceeding therein, or to pur­
sue a remedy upon a Judgment, whete he commences, institutes, or
otherwise resorts to the same, before the expiration of two years after
this act takes effect; in either of which cases, the provisions of law ap­
plicable thereto, immediately before this act takes effect, continue to be 
so applicable, notwithstanding the repeal thereof.
. 4. A ease, where the time to commence an action has expired, when 
this act takes ~ft'ect.
The word, " action," contained in thi~ chapter, is to be construed, 
'fihen ~tis neceesa.ry sb to do, as including a special proceeding, or any
proceeding therein, or in. an action. 
§ 415. The peri?ds of littii~ationl pre~cribed by this chapter, excep~
as otherwise specially prescribed ttlereint must be computed from the
time of the accruing of the right to relief by action, special proceeding, 
defence, or otherwise, as the case requires, to the time when the claim
to that relief ie actually interposed by the party, as a plaintift' or a de­
fendant, in the particulu action or special proceeding.

§ 416. A civil action is commenced by the service of a summons.
But from the time of the granting of a provlsional remedy, the court
acquires jurisdiction, and has control of all the subsequent proceedings.
Nevertheless, jurisdiction thus acquired is conditional, and liable to be
divested, in a eaee where the jurisdiction of the eonrt is made depend- 
ent, by a special provision of law, upon some act, to be done after the
granting of the provisionel remedy. 
§ 417. The summons must contain the title of the action, specifying
the court in which the action is brought, the names of the parties to
the action, and, if it is brou~ht in the supreme court, the name of the
county in which the plaintiff' desires the trial; and it must be sub-
scribed by the p1$.intift''s attorney, who. must add to h,is si~ature bis
ofiiee address, specifying ~ place within the State where there ~ a 
77 
pest-office, If in a city he must add the street, and street number, if
any, or other suitable designation of the particular locality. . 
§ 418. The summons, exclusive of the title of the action and the
subscription, must be substantially in the following form, the blanks
being properly filled : 
"To the above named defendant: You are hereby summoned to an­
swer the complaint in this action, and to serve a copy of your answer
on the plaintiff's attorney within twenty days after the service of this
summons, exclusive of the day of service ; and in case of your failure
to appear or answer, judgment will be taken agaiDBt you by default,'
for the relief demanded in the complaint. Dated ." The sum­
mons is deemed the mandate of the court. 
§ 419. A copy of the complaint may be served with the summons. 
H a copy of the complaint is not served with the summons, the plain­
tiff' cannot take judgment by default,~ application to the court, 
unless either the defendant appears, or a notice is served with the
summons, stating the sum of money for judgment will be ta.ken,
and the case is one embraced in the next section. 
§ 420. Judgment may be taken wit~out application to the court,
where the complaint sets forth one or more causes of action, each con­ 
sisting of the breach of an express contract to pay, absolutely or upon
a contingency, a sum or sums of money, fixed by the terms of the con­
tract, or capable of being ascertained therefrom, by computation only;
or an express or implied contract to pay money received or disbursed,
or the value of property delivered, or of services rendered by, to, or for
the use of, the defendant or a third person ; and thereupon demands
judgment for a sum of money only. This section includes a case,
where the breach of the contract set forth in the complaint, is only
partial; or where the complaintshows that the amount of the plaintiff's
demand baa been reduced by payment, counterclaim, or other credit. 
§ 421. The defendant's appearance mu.st be made by serving upon
the plaintiff's attorney, within twenty days after service of the
summons, exclusive of the day of service, a notice of ap_pearance, or a 
copy of a demurrer or of an answer. A notice or pleading, 80 served, 
must be subscribed by the defendant's attorney, who must add to his 
signature his office address, with the particulB.l'B prescribed in section
four hundred and seventeen of this act, concerning the office address
of the plaintiff's attorney. 
§ 422. A defendant, upon whom the plaintiff' baa served, with the
summons, a copy of the complaint, must serve a copy of bis demurrer 
or answer upon the plaintiff's attorney, before the expiration of the
time, within which the summons requires him to answer. If a copy of
the complaint is not 80 served, a notice of appearance entitles him only
to notice of the subsequent proceedings, unless within the same time
he demands the service of a copy of the complaint as prescribed in section four hundred and seventy-nine of this act. 
§ 423. Where a personal claim is not ma.de against a defendant, a
notice, subscribed by the plaintiff's attorney, setting forth the general
object of the action, a brief description of the property affected by it,
if it affects specific real or personal property, and that a personal claim
is not made against him, may be served with the summons. If the
defendant 80 served, unreasonably defends the action, coats may be 
awarded against him.
§ 424. A voluntary general appearance of the defendant is equiv- 
a.lent to personal service of the summons upon him. 
§ 425. The summons may be served by any person, other than ~
party to the action, except where it is otherwise specially prescribe 
by law. The plaintiff's attorney may, by an indorsement on the sum
mons, fix a time within which the service thereof must be me.de; i 
that case, the service cannot be made afterwards. Where a summons]
is delivered for service to the sheriff of the county, wherein the defend-:
ant is found, the sheriff must serve it, and return it, with proof of
service, to the plaintiff's attorney, with reasonable diligence. 
§ 426. Personal service of the summons upon a defendant, being a
natural person, must be made by delivering a copy thereof, within the 
State, as follows :
1. If the defendant is an infant, under the age of fourteen yea.rs, to!:'~~~=· 
the infant in person, and also to his father, mother or guardian; or,
if there is none within the State, to the person having the ca.re and
control of him, or with whom he resides, or in whose service he is
employed. 
2. If the defendant is a person judicially declared to be incompetent
to manage bis affairs, in consequence of lunacy, idiocy or habitual
drunkenness, and for whom a committee has been appointed, to the
committee, and also to the defendant in person. 
8. If the action is against a sheriff, for a cause epeeifled in section
one hundred and :fifty-ei~ht of this act, by delivering it to the de
fendant in person, or to his under-sheriff in person, or at the office of
the sheriff,durin8: the hours when it is required by law to be kept open,
to a deputy-sheriff or a clerk in the employment of the sheriff, or other
person in charge of the office. 
4. In any other case,to the defendant in person.
§ 427. If the defendant is an infant of the age of fourteen years, or 
upwards, or if the court has, in its opinion, reasonable ground to
believe, that the defendant, by reason of habitual drunkenness, or for 
any other cause, is mentally incapable adequately to protect his rights,
although not judicially declared to be incompetent to manage his affairs, 
the court may, in its discretion, with or without an application therefor,
and in the defendant's interest, make an order, requiring a copy of the 
summons to be also delivered, in behalf of the defendant, to a person 
designated in the order, and that service of the summons shall not be
deemed complete, until it is so delivered. 
§ 428. In a case specified in subdivision first or second of section four
hundred and twenty-six of this act, where the court has, in its opinion, 
reasonable ground to believe, that the interest of the person, other than
the defendant, to whom a. copy of the summons has been delivered, is ad-
verse to that of the defendant, or that, for any reason, be is not a fit per·
son to protect the rights of the defendant, it may likewise make an order, 
88 prescribed in the last section. In a case specified in subdivision sec-
cond, the court may, 88 a part of the same order, or by a. separate order, 
made, in like manner and upon like ground, at any stage of the action,
appoint a special guardian ad litem to conduct the aefence for the
incompetent defendant, to the exclusion of the committee, and with
the same powers, and subject to the same liabilities, as a committee of 
Uie property. .
§ 429. Where the defendant bas been judicially declared to be 
incompetent to manage his affairs, in coneeq uence of lunacy' and it
appears satisfactorily to the court, by affidavit, that the delivery of a 
copy of the summons to him, in person, will tend to aggravate his dis-
order, or to lessen the probability of his recovery, the court may make 
79 
an order, dispensing with such delivery. In that case; a delivery of a
copy of the summons, to a committee duly appointed for him, i'5 suffl­
eient personal service upon the defendant. 
§ 430. A resident of the State, of full age, may execute, under bis
hand, and acknowledge, in the manner required by Jaw to entitle a 
deed to be recorded, a written designation of another resident of' thft
State, as a person upon whom to serve a summons, or any process or 
other paper for the commencement of a civil special proceeding, in any
court. or. before any officer, during the absence from the United Stat.es
of the person making the designation ; and may file the same, with
the written consent of the person so designated, executed and acknowl- 
edged in the same manner, in the office of tbe clerk of the county,
where the person making the designation resides. The designation
must specify the oc~upa~ion or other proper addition, a!1d the residen~ 
of the person makmg It, and also of the person designated : and 1i
remains in force during the perlodspecifled therein, if any; or, if no 
period is specified. for that purpose, for tbm~...:e1~- aft~r the filing
thereof. But it is revoked earlier, by. the death: or egar'mcompetency 
of either of the pal'ties thereto ; or by the filing of a revocation
thereof, or of the consent, executed and acknowledged in like manner.
The clerk must file and record such a designation, consent, or revo­
cation ; and must note, upon the record of the original designation,
the filin~ and recording c,f a revocation. While the designation
remains m force, as prescribed in this section, a summons, or any pro­
eess or other paper for the commencement of a civil special proceeding,
against the person making it, in any court or before any officer, may be
served upon the person so designated, in like manner and with like 
effect, as if it was. served personally upon the person making the des­
ignation, notwithstanding the return of the latter to the United States. 
§ 431. Personal service of the summons upon a defendant, being a
domestic corporation, must be made by delivering a copy thereof, 
within the State, as follows:
1. If the action is against the mayor, alderman,* and commonalty of, 
the city of New-York, to the mayor, comptroller, or counsel to the cor-
poration. 
2. If the action is against any other city, to the mayor, treasurer,
counsel, attorney, or clerk; or, if the city lacks either of those officers,
to the officer performing corresponding functions, under another name. 
3~ In any other case, to the president or other head of the corpora­
tion, the secretary or clerk to the corporation, the cashier, the treas­ 
urer, or a director or managing agent.
§ 432. Personal service of the summon~, uPon a defendant, bei~g. a 
foreign corporation,_ must be made by delivering a copy thereof, within
the State, as follows : . . 
1. To the president, treasurer, or secretary; or, if the corporation

functions, under another name.
2. To a person designated for t~e purpose .by a ~ting, u.nder t~e 
seal of the corporation, and the signa~ure ~f Its presi~ent, vice-presi­
dent or other acting bead, accompanied with the wntten consent of
the person designated, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State. 
The designation must specif~ a place, withi'f!- t~e ~ta~, ~ the ?ffice or
residence of the person designated; and, 1f 1t is within a city, the 
street, and street number, if any, or.other suitable designation of the
particular locality. It remains in force, until the filing in the same 
office of a. written revocation thereof, or of the consent, executed in
like manner; but the person designated may, from time to time,
change the place specified as his office or residence, to some other place
within the State, by a. writing, executed by him, and filed in like man-
ner. The Secretary of State may require the execution of any instru-
ment, specified in this section, to be authenticated as he deems proper,
and he may refuse to file it without such an authentication. An exem-
plified copy of a. designation so filed, accompanied with a certificate
that it has not been revoked, is presumptive evidence of the execution
thereof, and conclusive evidence of the authority of the officer exe- 
cuting it.
3. If such a designation is not in force, or if neither the person 
designated, nor an. officer specified in subdivision first of this section,
can be found with due diligence, and the corporation has property
within the State, or the cause of action arose therein; to the cashier,
a director, or a managing agent of the corporation, within the State. 
§ 433. The provisions of this article, relating to the mode of service
of a. summons, apply likewise to the service of Bny process or other
paper, whereby a special proceeding is commenced in a court, or before
an officer, except a. proceeding to punish for contempt, and except
where special provision for the service thereof is otherwise made by law. 
§ 434. Proof of service, as prescribed in this article, must be made
by affidavit except as follows· 
1. It the service was made by the sheriff, it may be proved by his
certificate thereof. 
2. If the defendant served is an adult, who has not been judicially
declared to be incompetent to manage his affairs, the service may be 
proved by a written admission, signed by him, and either acknowl­
edged by him, and certified in like manner as a deed to be recorded 
in the county, or accompanied with the affidavit of a. person, other
than the plaintiff, showing that the signature is genuine. 
· A certificate,. admission, or affidavit of service of a summons, must
state the time and place or service. A written admission of the ser­
vice of a summons, or of a paper accompanying the same, imports,
unless otherwise expressly stated therein, or otherwise plainly to be 
inferred from its contents, that a copy of the paper was delivered to 
the person signing the. admission.

§ 435. Where a summons is issued in '- HllfNme eourt, an orde:r
for the service thereof, upon a defendant residing within the State
may be made by the court, or a judge thereof, or the couuty judge of 
the county where the action is triable, upon satisfactory proof, by the
affidavit of a person, not a party to the action, or by the return of the 
sheriff' of the county where the defendant resides, that proper and
diligent effort has been made to serve the summons upon the defend­
ant, and that the place of his sojourn cannot be ascertained, or, if he 
is within the State, that he a.voids service, so that personal service can-
not be made. · 
§ 436. The order must direct, that the service of the summons be
made, by leaving a copy thereof, and of the order, at the residence of 
the defendant, with a person of proper age, if upon reasonable appli­
cation, admittance can be obtained, and such a person found who will
receive it; or, if admittance cannot be so obtained, nor such a person ·
found, by affixing the same to the outer or other door oft.he defendant's
residence, and by depositing another copy thereof, properly incloscd
in a post-paid wrapper, addressed to him, at bis place of residence, in
the post-office at the place where he resides. 
§ 437. The order, and the papers upon which it was granted, must
be filed, and the service must be made, within ten days after the order 
is granted; otherwise the order becomes inoperative. On tiling an
affidavit, showing service according to the order, the summons is
deemed served, and the same proceedings may be taken thereupon, as
if it had been served by publication, pursuant to an order for that pur­ 
pose, made as prescribed in the next section.
§ 488. An order, directing the service of a summons upon a de­ 
fendant, without the State, or by publication, may be made in either
of the following cases : 
1. Where the defendant to be se:rved is a foreign corporation] or
being a natural person, is not a resident of the State ; or where, afte:r
diligent inquiry, the defendant remains unknown to the plaintiff, or
the plaintiff' is unable to ascertain whether the defendant is or is not 
a resident of the State.
2. Where the defendant, being a resident of the State, has departed 
the:refrom with intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid the service
of a summons; or keeps himself concealed therein, with like intent. 
S. Where the defendant, being an adult, and a resident of the State,
has been continuously without the United States more than six months
next before the granting of the order, and bas not made a designation
of a person, upon whom to se:rve a summons in his behalf, as pre­
scribed in section four hundred and thirty of this act; or a designation
so made no longer :reme.ins in force ; or service upon the person so
designated cannot be made within the State, after diligent effort. 
4. Where the complaint demands judgment annulling a mar­ 
riage, or for a divorce, or a separation.
5. Where the complaint demands judgment, that the defendant 
be excluded from a vested or coutin~nt interest in, or lien upon,
specific real or personal property withm the State; or that such an
interest or lien in favor of either party be enforced, regulated, deftned
or limited; or otherwise affecting the title to such property. 
~ 
6. Where the defendant is a resident of the State, or a domestic eor-
poration ; and an attempt was made to commence the action against
the defendant, as required in chapter fourth of this act, before the
expiration of the limitation applicable thereto, as fixed in that chap-
ter; and the limitation would have expired within sixty days next
preceding the application, if the time had not been extended by the
attempt to commence the action. 
7. Wbere the action is against the stockholders of a corporation, or
joint-stock company, and is authorized by a law of the State, and the
defendant is a stockholder thereof. 
§ 439. The order must be founded upon a verified complaint, show-
ing o. sufficient cause of action against the defendant to be served, and
proof by affidavit of the additional facts required by the last section;
and also, where the application is made upon the ground that the de- 
f endant is a foreign corporation, or not a resident of the State, or in a
case specified in subdivision fourth, fifth or seventh of the last section,
that the plaintiff has been or will be unable, with due diligence, to
make personal service of the summons. 
§ 440. The order may be made by a judge of the court, or the
county judge of the county where the action is triable. It must
direct that service of the summons, upon the defendant named or
described in the order, be made by publication thereof in two news- 
papers, designated in the order as most likely to give notice to the
defendant, for a specified time, which the judge deems reasonable, not
less than once a. week for six successive weeks ; or, at the option .of the
plaintiff, by service of the summons, and of a. copy of the complaint
and order, without the State, upon the defendant personally, if he is
of full age, or an infant of the age of fourteen years or upwards; or, if
the defendant is a corporation, upon an officer thereof, specified in section four hundred and thirty-one or four hundred and thirty-
two of this act. It must also contain, either a direction that,
on or before the day of the first publication, the plaintiff deposit in
a specified post-office, one or more sets of copies of the summons,
complaint, and order, each contained in a. securely closed post-paid
wrapper, directed to the defendant, at a place specified in the order;
or a statement that the judge, being satisfied, by the afilda.vits upon
which the order was granted, that the plaintiff cannot, with reasonable
diligence, ascertain a place or places, where the defendant would
probably receive matter transmitted through the post-office, dispenses
with the deposit of any papers therein. 
§ 441. The first publication, in each newspaper designated in the
order, or the service upon the defendant, without the State, must be 
made within three months after the order is granted. For the purpose
of reckoning the time, within which the defendant must appear or an-
swer, service by publication is complete, upon the day of the last pub-1"? 
lication pursuant to the order; and service made without the State is
complete, upon the expiration thereafter of a time equal to that pre-
scribed for publication. · 
§ 442. Where service is ma.de by publication, the summons, com-
plaint, and order, and the papers upon which the order was ma.de, must
be filed with the clerk, on or before the day of the first publica.tion ;
and a notice, subscribed by the plaintiff's attorney, and directed only
to the defendant or defendants to be thus served, substantiaJly in the 
following form, the blanks being properly filled up, must be subjoined
to, and published with the summons : 
"To : The foregoing summons is served upon you, by
publication, purSllant toan order of · ·· · · · "(naming the judge 
and his official title), "dated the day of· , 18 · , and
filed with the complaint in the office of the clerk of · at . " 
§ 448. Where service is made without the State, the papers specified
in the last section must be previously filed ; and a notice must be 
served with the summons, in all respects like the notice required by the
last section, except that the words, "without the State of New York," 
must be substituted for the words, " by publication." 
§ 444. Proof of the publication of the summons and notice must be
made by the affidavit of the printer or publisher, or bis foreman or prin .. 
cipal clerk. Proof of deposit in the post-office, or of delivery, of a paper
required to be deposlted or delivered by the provisions of this artiele,
must be made by the affidavit of the person, who deposited ot deliv­ 
ered it. , · · 
§ 445. Where the summons is served, pursuant to an order made ·as
prescribed in this article, a.nd the defendant so served does not appear,
he, or his representative, on application and sufficient cause shown, at 
any time before final jndgment, must be allowed to defend the action;
and, except in an action for divorce, or wherein the contrary is ex .. 
pressly prescribed by law, the defendant, or his representative, must, ·
in like manner, upon ~ood cause shown, and upon just terms, be allowed 
to defend, after final Judgment, at any time within one year after per ..
sonal service of written notice thereof; or, if such e. notice has not been
served, within seven years after the filing of the judgment-roll. If the
defence is successful, and the judgment, or any pa.rt thereof, has · been
collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution may thereupon be com­
pelled, as the court directs; but the title to property, sold, to a. pur­
chaser in good faitb,pursuant to a direction contained in the judgment,
or by vir+.ue of an execution issued upon the same, shall not be affected 
thereby.

§ 446. All persons h~ving an inie,~st In .the subject or'.the action,' a~~
in obtaining the judgment demanded, may be joined as plaintiff's, ex-
cept as otherwise expressly prescribed in this act. · . 
§ 447. Any person may be made a defendant, who has or claims an
interest in the controversy, adverse. to the plaintiff', or who is a uecessary 
party defendant, for the complete determination or settlement of a ques-
tion involved therein; except as otherwise expressly prescribed in this
act. 
§ 448. Of the parties to the action, those who are united in interest
JDUSt be joined as plaintiff's or defendants, except as otherwise expressly
pret1eribed in this act. But if the consent of any one, who ought to be 
joined as a plaintiff', cannot be obtained, he may be made a defendant,
the reason therefor being stated in the complaint. And where the 
question is one of a. common or general interest of many persons; or
where the persons, who might be made parties, are very numerous, and 
it may be impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more
m~ sue or defend for the benefit of all. 
§ 449. Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party
in interest, except that an executor or administrator, a trustee of an 
express trust, or a person. expressly authorized by statute, may sue,
without joining with him the person for whose benefit the action is 
prosecuted. A person, with whom or in whose name, a contract is
made for the benefit of another, is a trustee of an express trust, within
the meaning of this section. . . 
§ 450. In an action or special proceeding a married woman appears,
prosecutes, or defends, alone or joined with other parties as if she was
single. It is not necessary or proper to join her husband with her as a
party in any action or special proceeding affecting her separate property. 
§ 451. Where the plaintiff is ignorant of the name or part of the
name of a defendant, he may designate that defendant, m the sum- 
mons, and in any other process or proceeding in the action, by a
fictitious name, or by as much of his name BB is known, adding a. 
description, identifying the person intended. Where the plaintiff
demands judgment against an 'unknown person, he may designate that
pert:1on as unknown, adding a description, tending to identify him. In 
either case, the person intended is thereupon regarded as a defend.ant
in the action, and as sufficiently described therein, for all purposes, 
ineludin~ service of the summons, as prescribed in article second of
the last title. When the name, or the remainder of the name, or the
person, becomes known, an order must be made by the court, upon
such notice and such terms as it prescribes, that the proceedings
already taken be deemed amended, by the insertion of the true name,
in place of the flctitlous name or part of a name, or the designation 
as an unknown person ; and that all subsequent proceedings be taken
under the true name. 
§ 452. The court may determine. the controversy, as between the
parties before it, where it can do so without prejudice to the rights of
~tbers,. or ~y saying the.ii; rights ; ~ut where a complete determination 
of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties, 
th di h
e court must 1~ct t em t.o. be brou~ht in. A~d where a pe~n, not 
a party to the action, has an mterest m the subject thereof, or m real
property, the title to which may in any manner be affected by the
judgment, and makes application to the court to be made a party, it
must direct him to be brought in by the proper amendment. 
§ 453. Where the court directs a new defendant to be brought in,
and the order is not made upon his own application, a supplemental 
summons must be issued, directed to him, and iu the same form 8.8 an 
original summons; except that, in the body thereof, it must require
the defendant to answer the original or the amended complaint, and
the supplemental complaint, or either of them, as the case requires.
And each provision of this chapter, relating to personal service, or a
substitute for personal service of an original summons, applies to such 
a supplemental summons.

any of them, be included as defendants in the same action, at the
option of the plaintiff.

another person, as prescribed in the last section, oes not affect 1S
right to any order or other relief, to which he would have beeu euti- 
tied, if he had been separately sued in the action. 
§ 456. Where a summons, issued agaiuet two or more defendants,
alleged to be severally liable, is served npon some, but not upon all of 
them, the plaintiff may proceed against those upon whom it is served,
as if they were the ouly defendants named therein. Where it is served 
upon all of them, the plaintiff may take judgment against one or
more of them, where he would be entitled to judgment, if the action 
was against him or them aloue. Where judgment is so taken, the
clerk must, upon the plaintiff's application, enter an order, directing
that the action be severed, and that the plaintiff may proceed against
the other defendants. In any subsequent proceeding, the plaintiff
may use, together with a certified covy of such an order, a copy of a
paper constituting a part of the judgment-roll, with like effect as if
it was the original.

most act therein without compensation. 
§ 461. A person so admitted, may prosecute his action, without pay-

the time of the delivery of a copy of the summons to him, either within
or without the State, his attomey may, at any time within twenty days
after the service of the summons is complete, serve upon the plaintiff's

need be served upon him ; and if after service of a copy of the com­
plaint upon him, as attomey for a defendant, he appears for another
defendant, the last defendant must answer the complaint, within twenty
days after he appears in the action. 
§ 480. If the plaintift''s attorney fails to serve a copy of the com-
plaint, as prescribed in the last section, the defendant may apply to
the court for a dismissal of the complaint. 
§ 481. The complaint must contain :
1. The title of the action, specifying the name of the court in which 
it is brought; if it is brought in the supreme court, the name of the
county, which the plaintiff' designates as the place of trial; and the 
names of all the parties to the action, plaintiff and defendant.
2. A plain and concise statement of the facts, constituting each cause 
of action, without unnecessary repetition.
3. A demand of the judgment to which the plaintiff supposes him­ 
self entitled. 
§ 482. In an action triable by the court, without a jury, the plaintiff
may, in a proper case, demand an interlocutory judgment, and also a

§ 484. The plaintiff may unite, in the same complaint, two or more
causes of action, whether they are such as were formerly denominated
legal or equitable, or both, where they are brought to recover as 
follows :
1. Upon contract, express or implied. 
2. For personal injuries, except libel, slander, criminal conversation,
or seduction. 
8. For libel or slander.
4. For injuries to real property.
5. Real property, in ejectment, with or without damages for the 
withholding thereof.
6. For injuries to personal property.
7. Chattels, with or without damages for the taking or detention 
thereof.
8. Upon claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by oper­ 
ation of law.
9. Upon claims arising out of the same transaction, or transactions 
connected with the same subject of action, and not included within one
of the foregoing subdivisions of this section. 
But it must appear, npon the face of the complaint, that all the
causes of action, so united, belong to one of the foregoing subdivislona
of this section; that they are consistent with each other; and, except
as otherwise prescribed by law, that they affect all the parties to the
action ; and it must appear, upon the face of the complaint, that they
do not require different places of trial. 
§ 487. The only pleading on the part of the defendant is either a 
demurrer or an answer. 
§ 488. The defendant m&.y demur to the complaint, where one or
more of the following objections thereto appear upon the face thereof.

§ 490. The demurrer must distinctly specify the objections to the
complaint; otherwise it may · be disregarded. An objection, taken 
under subdivision first, second, fourth or eighth of section four hun­
dred and eighty-eight of this act, may be stated in the language of the subdivision; au objection, taken under either of the other subdivisions,
must point out specifically the particular defect relied upon. 
§ 492. The defendant may demur to the whole complaint, or to one
or more separate causes of actio_n, stated therein. In the latter case, 
be mar answer the causes of action not. demurred to.
§ 493. The defendant may also demur to the reply, or to a aeparate

§ 497. Upon the decision of a demurrer, either at a general or special 
term, or in the court of appeals, the court may, in its discretion, allow
the party in fault to plead anew or amend, upon such terms as are 
just. If a demurrer to a complaint is allowed, because two or more
causes of action have been improperly united, the court may, in its
discretion, and upon such terms as are just, direct that the action be
divided into as many actions, as are necessary for the proper determi-
nation of the causes of action therein stated.

~ . 
§ 501. The counterclaim, specified in the last section, must tend in
some way, to diminish or defeat the plaintiff's recovery, and must be 
one of the following causes of action against the plaintiff', or, in a proper
case, against the person whom he represents, and in favor of the de­
fendant, or of one or more defendants, between whom and the plaintiff a
separate judgment may be had in the action: 
1. A cause of action, arising out of the contract or transaction, set
forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or con­
nected with the subject of the action. 
2. In an action on contract, any other cause of action on contract,
existing at the commencement of the action. 
§ 502. But the counterclaim, specified in subdivision second of the
la.st section, is subject to the following rules : 
1. If the action is founded upon a contract, which has been assigned
by the party thereto, other than a negotiable promissory note or bill of
exchange, a demand, existing against the party thereto, or an assignee
of the contract, at the time of the assignment thereof, and belonging
to the defendant, in good faith, before notice of the assi~ment, must
be allowed as a counterclaim, to the amount of the plaintiff's demand,
if it might have been so allowed against the party, or the assignee,
while the contract belonged to him. . 
2. If the action is upon a negotiable promissory note or bill of ex­
change, which has been assigned to the plaintiff after it became due, a
demand, existing against a person who assigned or transferred it, after
it became due, must be allowed as a counterclaim, to the amount of the
plaintiff's demand, if it might have been so allowed against the
assignor, while the note or bill belonged to him. 
S. If the plaintiff is a trustee for another, or if the action is in the
name of a plaintiff', who has no actual interest in the contract upon
which it is founded, a demand against the plaintiff' shall not be allowed
as a counterclaim ; but so much of a demand existing agail18t the per­
son whom he represents, or for whose benefit the action is bronght, as
will satisfy the plaintiff's demand, must be allowed as a counterclaim,
if it might have been so allowed in an action brought by the person 
beneficially interested. 
§ 503. Where a counterclaim is eetabllehed, which equals the plain­
tiff''s demand, the judgment must be in favor of the defendant. Where 
it is less than the plaintiff's demand, the plaintiff must have J0udeient
for the residue only. Where it exceeds the plaintiff's demand, t e de- 
Cendant must have judgment for the excess, or so much thereof as is
due from the plaintiff. Where part of the excess is not due from the 
§ 504. In a· case not specified in the last section, where a counter­
laim is established, which entitles the defendant to an affirmative 
plaintiff, the jndgment does not prejudice the defendant's right to re­
cover, from another person, so much thereof as the judgment does not
cancel. 
[udgment, demanded in the answer, judgment must be rendered for
he defendant accordingly. 
§ 505. In an action against an executor or an administrator, or other
person sued in a representative capacity, the defendant may set forth, 
as a counterclaim, a demand belonging to the decedent, or other person
whom he represents, where the person so represented would have been
entitled to set forth the same, in an action against him. 
§ 506. In an action brought by an executor or administrator, in bis rep­
resentative capacity, a demand against the decedent, belonging, at the 
time of bis death, to the defendant., may be set forth by the defendant
as a counterclaim, as if the action had been brought by the decedent 
in his lifetime; and, if a balance is fouud to be due to the defendant,
judgment must be rendered therefor against the plaintiff, in his repre­
sentative capacity. Execution can be issued upon such a judgment,
only in a case where it could be issued upon a judgment, in an action
against the executor or administrator. 
§ 507. A defendant may set forth, in his answer, as many defenceirey~
or counterclaims, or both, as he has, whether the are such as were 
formerly denominated legal or equitable. Each defence or counter-
claim must be separately stated, and numbered. Unless it is inter-
posed as an answer to the entire complaint, it must distinctly refer to 
the cause of action which it is intended to answer. 
§ 508. A :pal'tial def'ence may be set forth, as prescribed in the last section; but it TIJBt be eyrceH~ §tated t,Q be a p,rtj11) .def~~ to the 
entire complaint, or to one or more separate causes of action, therein
set forth. Upon a demurrer thereto, tbe qne,tjgp i, whether it is 
sufficient for that purpose. Matter tending only to mitigate or reduce'
damages, in an action to recover damages for the breach of a promise 
to marry, or for a personal injury, or an injury to property, is a partial
defence within the meaning of this section.

§ 511. Where the answer of the defendant, expressly or by not 
denying, admits a. part of the plaintiff's claim to be just, the court,
upon the plaintiff's motion, may, in its discretion, order that the action 
be severed ; that a judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the part
so admitted; and, if the plaintiff' so elects, that the action be con- 
tinned, with like effect, as to the subsequent proceedings, as if' it had
been originally brought, for the remainder of the claim. The order 
must prescribe the time and manner of the plaintiff's election. If the
plaintiff' elects to continue the action, bis right to costs upon the judg-
ment is the same, as if it was taken in an action brought for only that
part of the claim. If the plaintiff does not elect to continue the action, 
costs must be awarded, as upon final judgment in any other cue.
§ 512. In an action upon contract, where the complaint demands 
judgment for a sum of money only, if the defendant, by his answer,
does not deny the plaintiff's claim, but sets up a counterclaim. amount- 
ing to less than the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff, upon filing with the
clerk an admission of the counterclaim, may take judgment f'or the 
excess, as upon a default for want of an answer. The admission must
be made a part of the judgment-roll. 
§ 513. A defence, which does not involve the merits of the action,
shall not be pleaded, unless it is verified as prescribed in title second 
of this chapter.

or information thereof sufficient to form a belief; and it may set forth
in ordinary and concise. language, without repetition, new matter not
inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a. defense to the counter­
claim. 
§ 515. If the plaintiff" fails to reply or demur to the counterclaim,
the defendant may apply, upon notice, for judgment. thereupon; and,
if the case requires it, a reference may be ordered, or a. writ of inquiry 
may be issued, as prescribed in chapter eleventh of this act, where the
plaintiff applies for judgment.

by way of a.v:oidance, the court may, in it.a discretion, on the defend­
ant's application, direot the plaintiff to reply to the new matter. In 
that case, the reply, and the proceedings upon failure to reply. are 
oubject to the same rules as in the case of a counterclaim.
§ 517. A reply may contain two or more distinct avoidances of the

cept a demurrer, or the general answer of an infant by bis guardian 
ad litem, most also be verified. But the verification may be omitted,
in a case where it is not otherwise specially prescribed by law, where
the party pleading would be privileged from testifying, as a witness, 
concerning an allegation or denial contained in the pleading. {A plead-
ing cannot be used, in a criminal pros~~tion against the plL'rty, as 
proof of a. fact admitted or alleged ther~
§ 524. The allegations or denials in a verified pleading must, in form, 
be stated to be made by the party pleading. Unless they are therein
stated to be made upon t.be information and belief of the party, they
must be regarded, for all pnrposes, including ft. criminal prosecution, 
as having been made upon the knowledge of the person verifying the
pleading. An allegation that the party bas not sufficient knowledge 
or information, to form a belief, with respect to a matt.er, must, for the
same purposes, be regarded as an allegation that the person verifying
the pleading has not such knowledge or information. 
§ 525. The verification must be made by the affidavit of the party,
or, if there are two or more parties united in interest, and pleading 
together, by at least one of them, who is acquainted with the facts,
except as follows : 
1. Where the party is a domestic corporation, the verification must 
be made by an officer thereof.
2. Where the people of the State are, or a public officer, in their 
behalf, is the party, the verification may be made by any person ac- 
qnainted with the facts. 
8. Where the party is a foreign corporation ; or where the party
Is not within the county where the attorney resides, or,if the latter is
not a resident of the State, the county where he has his office, and
capable of making the affidavit; or, if there are two or more parties
united in interest, and plea.din~ together, where neither of them,
acquainted with the facts, is within that county, and capable of 
making the affidavit ~r ~ere the action or defence is founded upon
a written instrument payment of money only, which is in the 
J)088088ion of the agent or the attoJ:'1i::YJ:rr where all the material alle­
gations of the plea.din~ are wi personal knowledge of the 
agent or the attorney ; m either case, the verification may be made
by t~e agent of or the attorney for the party. 
§ 526. The affidavit of verification must be to the effect, that the
pleading is true to the knowledge of the deponent, except as to the 
matters therein stated to be alle~ed on information and belief, and that
as to those matters he believes 1t to be true. Where it is made by a
person, other than the party, he must set forth, in the affidavit, the
grounds of bis belief, as to all matters not stated upon his knowledge, 
and the reason why it is not made by the party.
lt8 
§ 527. Where the complaint is not verified, and the answer sets up
counterclaim, and also a defence by way of denial or avoidance, the 
affidavit of verification may be made to refer exclusively to the counter-
claim. In that case, the last three sections are applicable to the affi- 
davit and the counterclaim, as if the latter was a separate pleading.
§ 528. The remedy for a defective verification of a pleading is to 
treat the same as an unverified pleading. Where the copy of a plead-
ing is served without a copy of a sufficient verification, in a case where 
the adverse party is entitled to a verified pleading, he may treat it as
a nullity, provided he gives notice, with due diligence, to the attorney 
of the adverse party, that he elects so to do.
§ 529. A defendant is not excused from verifying his answer to 
complaint, charging him with having confessed or suffered a judg-
ment, or executed a conveyance, assignment, or other instrument, or
transferred or delivered money, or personal property, with intent to 
hmder, delay, or defraud his creditors; or with being a. party or privy 
to such a transaction by another person, with like intent towards the
creditors of that person; or with any fraud whatever, affecting a right
or the property of another. 
§ 530. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it
is sufficient to designate the statute by its chapter, year of passage and title, or in some other manner with convenient certainty, without set-
tin_g forth any of the contents thereof. 
§ 531. It is not necessary for a party to set forth, in a pleading, thet;ccounc
items of an account therein alleged; but in that case, he must deliver toifc~ed.
the adverse party, within ten days after a written demand thereof, a
copy of the account, which, if the pleading is verified, must be verified.
by his affidavit, to the effect, that he believes it to be true; or, if the:
facte are within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney for
the party, or the party is not within the county where the attorney
resides, or capable of making the affidavit, by the affidavit of the agent
or attorney. If be feiJs 89 tp dQ, he,~,pr.eclwied ~.giving.erldence 
oC the eccourt The court, or a judge authorized to make an order in
the action, may direct the party to deliver a further account, where the
one delivered is defective. The court may, in any case, direct a bill
of the particulars of the claim of either party to be delivered to the·
ad verse party. · 
§ 532. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of a court
or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts
conferring jurisdiction ; but the judgment or determination may be 
stated to have been duly tpven or made. If that allegation is con-
troverted, the party pleadmg must, on the trial, establish the facts
zonferrlng jurisdiction. 
§ 533. ln pleading the performance of a condition precedent in a
contract, it is not necessary to state the facts constituting performance; 
but the party may state, generally, that he, or the person whom he
represents, duly performed an the conditions on his part. If that a11e- 
ga.tion is controverted, he must, on the trial, establish performance.
§ 584. Where a cause of action, defence, or counterclaim, is founded 
upon an instrument for the payment of money only, the party may set
forth a copy of the instrument, and state that there is due to him
thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims. 
Buell an allegation is equivalent to setting forth the instrument, accord-
ing to its legal effect. 
{}9 
§ 585. It is not necessary, in an action for, libel or slander, to state,
in the complaint, any extrinsic fact, for the purpose of showing the 
application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter; but the plain­
tiff may state, general1y, that it was published or spoken concerning
him; and, if that a~ation is controverted, the plaintiff must estab­
lish it on the trial. (Lo. such an action, the defendant may prove miti­
gating circumstances, notwithstanding that he has pleaded or attempted

ending to mitigate or otherwise reduce the plaintiff's damages, if they 
e set forth in the answer, either with or without one or more defences
the entire cause of action. A defendant, in default for want of an 
tanswer, may, upon a reference or inquiry to ascertain the amount of
,the plaintiff's damages, prove facts of that description. 
§ 537. If a demurrer, answer, or reply is frivolous, the party
prejudiced thereby, upon a previous notice to the adverse party, of not 
less than five days, may apply to the court or to a judge of the court
for judgment thereupon, and judgment may be given accordingly. If
the application is denied, an appeal cannot be taken from the deter­
mination, and the denial of the application does not prejudice any of
the subsequent proceedings of either party. Costs, as upon a motion,
may be awarded upon an application pursuant to this section. 
§ 539. A variance, between an allegation in a pleading and the
roof, is not material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party

ars in which he has been misled, must be proved to the satisfaction of
he court. Thereupon the court may, in its discretion, order the plead- 
ing to be amended, upon .such terms as it deems just.
540. Where the variance is not material, as prescribed in the last section, the court ma.y direct the fact to be found according to the evi­
dence, or may order an iJµme9ja.i_e__J).mend~!!t, without costs. 
§ 541. Where, however:1nea.Tiegatfonto ~.wnTch the proof is directed,
is unproved, not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire
scope and meaning, it is not a case of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
§ 542. Within twenty days after a pleading, or the answer or de- 
murrer thereto, is served, or at a.uy time before the/eriod for answer­
ing it expires, the pleading may be once amende by the party, of
course, without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already
bad. But if it is made to appear to the court, that the pleading was
amended for the purpose of delay, and that the adverse party will 
thereby lose the benefit of a term, for which the cause is or may be 
noticed, the amended pleading may be stricken out, or the pleading
may be restored to its original form, and such terms imposed as the
court deems just. 
§ 543. Where a pleading is amended, as prescribed in the last sec­
tion, a copy thereof must be served upon the attorney for the adverse
party. A failure to demur to, or answer the amended pleading, within
twenty days thereafter, has the same effect as a like failure to demur 
to, or answer the original pleading. 
lOO 
§ 544. Upon the application of either party, the court may, and, in
a proper case, must, upon such terms as are just, permit him to make 
a supplemental complaint, answer or reply, alleging material facts
which occurred after his former pleading, or of which he was ignorant
when it was made; including the judgment or decree of a competent
court, rendered after the commencement of the action, determining the
matters in controversy, or a part thereof. The party may apply for
leave to make a supplemental pleading, either in addition to, or in place
of, the former plea.ding. In the former event, if the application is
granted, a provisional remedy, or other proceeding already taken in
the action is not affected by the supplemental pleading; but the right
of the adverse party to have it vacated or set aside, depends upon the
ease presented by the original and supplemental plea.dings. 
§ 545. Irrelevant, redundant, or scandalous matter contained in ~Motion 
pleading, may be stricken out upon the motion of a person aggrieve
thereby. Where scandalous mat.ter is thus stricken out, the attorney, 
whose name is subscribed to the pleading, may be directed to pay th
costs of the motion, and his failure to pay them may be punished as a
oontempt of the court. 
§ 546. Where one or more denials or allegations,contained in a plead-
ing are 80 indefinite or uncertain that the precise meaning or application 
thereof, is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made
definite and certain by amendment.

§ 549. A defendant may be arrested in an action, as prescribed in
this title, where the action is brought for eith.er of the following causes : 
1. To recover a fine or penalty.
2. To recover dam~es for a personal injury; an injury to property, 
including the wron ul taking, detention, or conversion of personal
property ; breach o a promise to marry ; misconduct or neglect in
office, or in a professional employment; fraud; or deceit. But this subdivision does not apply to a claim for damages in an action to
recover a chattel. 
S. To recover money, funds, credits, or property, held or owned by
the State, or held or owned, officially or otherwise, for or in behalf of
a public or governmental interest, by a municipal or other public cor­
poration, board, officer, custodian, agency, or agent, of the State, or of

obtained, received, converted, or disposed of; or to recover damages
for so obtaining, receiving, paying, converting, or disposing of the same. 
4. In an action upon contract, express or implied, other than a
promise to marry, where it is alleged in the complaint that the defend­ 
ant was guilty of a fraud in contracting or incurring the liability.
lO'J 
Where such an allegation is ma.de, the plaintiff' cannot recover unless
be proves the fraud ; and a judgment for the defendant is not a bar to( 
a new action to recover upon the contract only.
§ 550. A defendant may also be arrested as prescribed in this title, 
in either of the following cases : 
1. In an action to recover a chattel, when the chattel, or a part there­
of, has been concealed, removed, or disposed of, so that it cannot be
f'ound or taken by the sheriff', and with intent that it should not be so 
found or taken, or to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof.
2. In an action upon contract, express or implied, other than a 
promise to marry, where the defendant has, since the making of the

misapplied, by a public officer, or by an attorney, solicitor or counselor,
or by an officer or agent of a corporation or banking association, in
the. course of his employment, or by a factor, ~ent, broker or other
person in a fiduciary capacity. But this subdivlalon does not apply 
to an action to recover a chattel.
4. In an action wherein the judgment demanded requires the per­ 
formance of an act, the neglect or refusal to perform which would be 
punishable by the court as a contempt, where the defendant is not a
resident of the State, or, being a resident, is about to depart there­
from, by reason of which non-residence or departure there is danger
that a. jud8'!llent or an order requiring the perfonnance of the act will
be rendered ineffectual. 
§ 551. In a case specified in subdivision fourth of the last section, the
order of arrest can be granted only by the court; is always in its dis-
cretion; and may be granted or served, either before or after final
judgment, unless an appeal from the judgment is pending, upon which
security has been given, sufficient to stay the execution thereof. In
either of the other cases specified in the last two sections, the order
cannot be served after final judgment ; but it may be granted, where
a proper case therefor is _presented, at any time before final judgment. 
§ 552. The recovery of judgment in a court, not of the State, for the
same ca.use of action; or, where the action is founded upon fraud or 
deceit, for the price or value of the property obtained thereby ; dces
n(!t affect the right of the plaintiff' to arrest the defendant, as prescribed
in this title. 
§ 553. A woman cannot be arrested, as prescribed in this title, ex-
cept in a case where the order can be granted only by the court; or

§ 556. An order for the arrest of the defendant, except as othenme
prescribed in section five hundred and fifty-one of this act, must be 
obtained from a judge of the court in which the action is brought, or
from any county judge. 
§ 557. The order may be granted, in a case specified in section five
hundred and forty-nine of this act, where it appears by the affidavit
of the plaintiff, or any other person, that a sufficient cause of action
exists against tho defendant, as prescribed in that section. It may
be granted, in a case specified in section five hundred and fifty of this 
act, upon the like proof that a sufficient cause of action exists against
the defendant, as prescribed in that section, and of the other matters,
extrinsic to the cause of action, specified in that section. The affi.
davit may also contain any statement, tending to determine the
amount of bail to be required. · 
§ 558. Subject to the provisions of the last preceding article, the
order may be granted at any time, after the commencement of the
action. It may also be granted, to accompany the summons. But at 
any time after the filing or service of the complaint, the order of a.rrest
must be vacated on motion, if the complaint fails to set forth a suffi- 
cient cause of action, as required by the last section.
§ 559. Except where the action is brought for a cause specified in subdivision third of section five hundred and forty-nine of this act, or
in a case where it is specially prescribed by law that security may be 
dispensed with, or the security to be given is specially regulated by
law, the judge, before he grants the order, must require a written un­
dertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with two sufficient sureties, to
the effect that, if the defendant recovers judgment, or if it is finally
decided that the plaintiff was not entitled to the order of arrest, the
plaintiff will pay all costs which may be awarded to the defendant,
and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, not
exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which must be at
least equal to one-tenth of the amount of bail required by the order,
and not less than two hundred and fifty dollars. 
§ 560. Where the order can be granted only by the court, an under­
taking on the part of the plaintiff may be dispensed with. If it is re- 
quired, its form, and the security to be given thereupon, must be
h 
ibe
sue as the court prescn s. 
§ 561. The order must be subscribed by the plaintiff's attorney, and
except where it is granted by the court, by the judge. It may be 
directed, either to the sheriff of a particular county, or, generally, to~;;:~~~ 
the sheriff' of any county. It must require the sheriff' forthwith to 
arrest the defendant, if he is found within his county; to hold him to
bail in a specified sum; and to return the order, with his proceedings
thereunder, as prescribed by law. The plaintiff's attorney may, at his
option, by an indorsement upon the order, or, where it was granted
by the court, upon the copy thereof, delivered to the sheriff, fix a
time within which the defendant must be arrested. In that case, he
cannot be arrested afterwards under the same order. 
§ 562. The order of arrest, or, where it was granted by the court,
a certified copy thereof, subscribed by the plaintiff's attorney; and,
in either case, the papers upon which the order was ~anted, with 
the undertaking, if any; must be delivered to the sheriff', who, upon
arresting the defendant, must deliver to him a copy thereof. The 
papers, upon which the order was granted, with the undertaking, if
any, must be filed, with the order of arrest, or a certified copy there-
of, at the time prescribed for filing the same, in section five hundred
and ninety or this act. 
§ 563. The sheriff' must execute the order by arresting the defend-
ant, if he is found within his county, and keeping him in custody,
until discharged by law.  
§ 564. This title does not abridge or affect a privilege from arrest given
by law, or a right of action for a breach thereof. A privile~ed person
is entitled to be discharged from arrest, where other provision is not
made therefor by law, by the court, or a judge thereof; or by the
county judge of the county, or a judge of a superior city court of the city~~:~
where the arrest was made. The order must be made, upon proof by
affidavit, of the fR.cts entitling the applicant to the discharge; and the
arrest and discharge are not a bar to a new arrest, after the privilege has
ceased. The court or judge may make the order without notice, or may
require notice to be given to the sheriff, or to the plaintiff, or to both, 
§ 565. An officer of a court of record, appointed or elected pursuant 
to law, is privileged from arrest, during the actual sitting, which he ia
required to attend, of a term of the court of which he is an officer, and
no longer; but an attorney or counsellor is not thus privileged, unless
be is employed in a cause, to be heard at that term. · 
§ 566. Excedit where an order of arrest can be granted only by the
court, a defen ant, arrested before answer, has twenty days after the
arrest, in wh!ch to answer the complaint; and judgment must be
stayed accordmgly. 
§ 567. Except where an order of arrest can be granted only by the
court, a defendant, arrested as prescribed in this title, may, at any 
time before final judgment, or, if he was arrested within twenty days
before final judgment, at any time within twenty days after the arrest, 
apply to vacate the order of arrest; or to rednce the amount of bail ; 
or to increase the security given by the plaintiff; or for one or more of
those forms of relief, together, or in the alternative. In a case where
the order of arrest can be granted 011ly by the court, a like application
may be made, at any time within twenty days after the arrest ; and an
application to increase the security given by the plaintiff, may be made 
at any time before final judgment. 
§ 568. An application, specified in the last section, may be founded
only upon the papers upon which the order was granted ; in which 
case, it must be made to the court, or, if the order was granted by a
judge out of court, to the same judge, in court or out of court, and
with or without notice, as be deems proper, and the application must 
be heard upon those papers only. Or it may be founded upon proof,
by affidavit, on the part of the defendant ; in which case, it must be 
made to the court, or, if the order was granted by a judge, out of court, 
to any judge of the court, upon notice ; and it may be opposed by new
proof, by a.ffidavit, on the part of the plaintiff, tending to sustain any
ground of arrest recited in the order, and no other, unless the defend­
ant relies upon a discharge in bankruptcy, or upon a discharge or ex­
oneration, granted in insolvent proceedings; in which case, tile plain­
tiff may show any matter in avoidance thereof, which he might show
upon the trial. 
§ 572. Except in a case where an order of arrest can be granted only
by the court, if the defendant ie in actual custody, by virtue of an
order of arrest in the action, and the plaintiff neglects to enter judg­
ment in the action, within one month after it is in his power to do so;
or neglects to issue execution against the person of the defendant,
within three months after the entry of judgment; the defendant must,
on his application, made upon notice to the plaintiff, be discharged
from custody, by the court in which the action was commenced, or by
a judge thereof, within the county where the defendant is in custody ;
unless reasonable cause is shown why the application should not be
granted. A defendant discharged aA prescribed in this section shall
not be arrested upon an execution issued upon a judgment in the
action.

§ 578. The defendant, at any time before he is in contempt, where
the order can be granted only by the court, or, in any other case, a.t 
any time before execution against his person, must be discharged from
arrest, either upon giving bail, or upon depositing the sum specified in 
the order of arrest. The defendant may give bail, or make the deposit, 
immediately upon his arrest, at any hour of the day or night; and bef
must have reasonable opportunity to see* for and to procure bail, beforel 
being committed to jail.
§ 574. Where the defendant is actually confined in the jail, by virtue 
of an order of arrest, and final or interlocutory judgment has been!":!:!~~
rendered against him in the action, but an execution against his person 
has not been issued, he may elect, either to give a bond for the liberties
of the jail, or to give bail or make a deposit, as prescribed in this article.
§ 575. The defendant may give bail, by delivering to the sheriff a. 
written undertaking, in the sum specified in the order of arrest, exe-
cnted by two or more sufficient bail, stating their places of residence
and occupations, to the following effect: 
1. If the order of arrest could be granted only by the court, that the
defendant will obey the direction of court, or of an appellate court,
contained in an order or a judgment, requiring him to perform the act
specified in the order; or, in default of his so doing, that he will, at all
times, render himself amenable to proceedings to punish him for the 
omission.
2. If the action is to recover a chattel, that the defendant will 
deliver it to the plaintiff, if delivery thereof is adjudged in the action,
and will pay any sum recovered against him in the action. 
3. In any other case, that the defendant will, at all times, render
himself amenable to any mandate, which may be issued to enforce a
flnal judgment against him in the action. 
§ 576. 1t is not necessary that the undertaking should be approved,
or accompanied with an affidavit of justification of the bail. But
the officer, taking the acknowledgment of the undertaking, must, if~
the sheriff so requires, examine under oath, to a reasonable extent, the
persons offering to become bail, concerning their property and their
circumstances. The examination must be reduced to writing, sub
scribed by the bail, and annexed to the undertaking. 
§ 577. Within three days aft.er bail is given, the sheriff must deliver 
to the plaintiff's attorney copies, certified by him, of the order of
arrest, retum and undertaking. The plaintiff's attorney, within ten 
dayd thereafter, must serve upon the sheriff a notice that he does not
accept the bail ; otherwise he is deemed to have accepted them, and
the sheriff is exonerated from liability. 
§ 578. Within ten days after the receipt of the notice, the sheriff or
the defendant may serve upon the plaintiff's attomey, notice of the
justification of the same or other bail, specifying the place of residence
and occupation of each of the latter, before a judge of the court, or a 
county judge, at a. specified time and place; the time to be not less
than five nor more than ten days thereafter, and the place to be within
the county where one of the bail resides, or where the defendant was 
arrested. If other bail are given, a. new undertaking must be executed,
as _prescribed in section five hundred and seventy-five of this act. 
§ 579. The qualifications of bail are as follows: ·
1. Each of them must be a resident of, and a householder or free- 
holder within the State.
2. Each of them must be worth the sum specified in the order ol 
arrest, exclusive of property exempt from execution; but the judge,
on justification, may allow more than two bail to justify, severally, in 
107 
sums less than that specified in the order, if the whole j118tifl.cation is
equivalent to that of two sufficient bail . 
§ 580. For the purpose ·of justification, each of the bail must attend
before the jndge, at the time and place mentioned in the notice, and 
be examined on oath, on the part of the plaintiff, touching his suffi­
ciency, in such manner as the judge, in his discretion, thinks proper.
The judge may, in his discretion, adjourn the examination from day
to day, until it is completed; but such an adjonmment must always
be to the next judicial day, unless by consent of parties. If required
by the plaintiff's attomey, the examination must be reduced to writ­
ing, and subscribed by the bail. 
§ 581. If the judge finds the bail sufficient, he must annex the
examination to the undertaking, indorse bis allowance thereon, and 
cause them to be filed with the clerk. The sheriff is thereupon exon­
erated from liability. 
§ 582. The defendant may, instead or giving bail, deposit with the
sheriff the sum specified in the order. "I'he sheriff must thereupon 
give the defendant a certificate of the deposit, and discharge him from
custody. 
§ 583. The sheriff must, within four days after the deposit, pay it
into court. He must take, from the officer receiving it, two certificates 
of the payment, one <,f which he mast deliver to the plaintiff, and the
other to the defendant. For a default in makin~ the payment, the
official bond of the sheriff may be prosecuted, as m any other case of
delinquency. 
§ 584. If money is deposited, as prescribed in the last two sections,
bail may be given, and may justify upon notice, at any time before 
the expiration of the right to be discharged on bail. Thereupon the
jjudge, before whom the justification is had, must direct, in the order
of allowance, that the money deposited be refunded to the defendant,
or his representative, and it must be refunded accordingly. 
§ 585. If money deposited is not refunded, as prescribed in the last section, it is, in a case where the order of arrest could be granted Qnly 
by the court, subject to the direction of the court, as justice requires,
before and after the judgment. In any other case, if it remains on
deposit, when final judgment is rendered for the plaintiff, it must be 
applied, under the direction of the court, in satisfaction of the judg­
ment; and the surplus, if any, must be refunded to the defendant, or
bis representative. If the final judgment is for the defendant, or the
action abates, or is discontinued, the sum deposited, and remaining
unapplied, must be refunded to the defendant or his representative. 
§ 686. At any time before the deposit is paid into court, the defend­
ant may deliver to the sheriff a written direction, to pay it to a third 
person, therein specified, in the event that the defendant becomes
entitled to a return thereof, but without expressing any other eontin- 
~ncy. The direction must be acknowledged or proved, and certified,
m like manner as a deed to be recorded; and the sheriff must deliver
it to the officer who receives the deposit, who must note the substance
thereof, with the entries of the deposit, in bis books, and upan the two
certificates of payment into court. The money thus deposited is
deemed the property of the third person, subject to the plaintiff's
interest therein, and subject to the rights of a creditor of the defend­
ant, where the direction was given for the purpose of hindering,
delaying, or defrauding creditors. The money, or the residue thereof,
must be paid to the third person, where, by the provisions or the la.st 
two sections, it is required to be refunded to the defendant, or bis
representative. 
§ 587. If, after the defendant is arrested, he escapes or is rescued,lsherUr
or the bail, if any, given by him, do not justify, when they are not~:e:i 
accepted, or if the sheriff' fails to pay the deposit into court as required;his
by section five hundred and eight.y-three of this act, the sheriff is~:o~S::.. 
liable as bail. But the sheriff' may, except in an action to recover afbility. 
chattel, discharge himself from liability, by the giving and justifica-1
tion of bail, as follows : 
1. If the case is one where the order could be granted onlf by thei 
court, at any time before the court directs the performance o the ac~
specified in the order. 
2. In any other case, at any time before an execution is issued
against the person of the defendant, upon a judgment in the action .. 
§ 588. If judgment is recovered atgainst the sheriff, upon bis lia-
bility as bail, and an execution thereon is returned wholly or partly
unsatisfied, the official bond of the sheriff may be prosecuted, as in 
any other case of delinquency. 
§ 589. The bail taken upon the arrest, unless they justify, or other
bail are given and justify, are liable to the sheriff for all damages'°
which he sustains by reason of the omission. 
§ 590. Within ten days after the defendant is arrested if he does
not give bail, or if he gives bail, within ten days after the just.iii.cation
of th:e bail, the sheriff must file with the clerk the order of arrest, or,
where it was granted by the court, the certified copy thereof delivered 
to him, with bis return thereupon indorsed, the papers upon which
the order of arrest was granted, and the undertaking given on the
part of the plaintiff. Where an order of arrest, directing the arrest
of two or more defendants, has been executed as to one or more, but
not as to all of them, the sheriff may file a copy of the order of arrest, 
instead of the original.

2. A certified copy of the undertaking of the bail must be delivered 
u.o 
to the sheriff', who must detain the defendant in his custody thereupon,
as upon the original mandate, and must, by a certificate in writing, 
acknowledge the surrender. Upon the application of the bail, made
upon notice to the plaintiff's attomey, and upon production of the
sheriff's certificate and a copy of the undertaking, a judge of the court,
or the county judge of the county where the action is triable, may make
au order, directing that the bail be exonerated. On filing the order
and the papers used on the application therefor, the bail are exonerated 
aecordingly. 
§ 593. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail, ai
any place or at any time before they are finally charged, may them­ 
selves arrest him, or by a written authority, indorsed on a certified
copy of the undertaking, may empower another person to do so ; and
one or more of the bail may thlll\ arrest and surrender the defendant,
although the others do not join with him or them, for that purpose. 
§ 594. Where the defendant surrenders himself in exoneration of hie
bail, he must present himself to the sheriff', and require the sheriff', in 
writing, to take him into custody, in exoneration of his bail. The
sheriff' must detain him accordingly, as prescribed in subdivision 
second of section five hundred and ninety-two of this act ; and, if
requested by the bail, at any time ai'ter the surrender, the sheriff must,
by a certificate in writing, acknowledge the surrender. An order for
the exoneration of the bail may be procured, as prescribed in section
five hundred and ninety-two of this act. 
§ 595. Where the sheriff' is liable as bail, be has all the rights and
privileges, and is subject to all the duties and liabilities of bail; and
bail given by him, in order to discharge himself from liability, must 
be regarded as the bail of the defendant in the action. But this sec­
tion does not apply to an action to recover a chattel ; or to a case where
a defence arises to an action against the bail, in consequence of an act
or omission of the sheriff. 
§ 596. In case of faiJure to comply with the undertaking, the bail
may be proceeded against by action, and not otherwise. 
§ 597. An action may be brought, as prescribed in the last section,
in a case where the order of arrest could be granted only by the court, 
at any time after the bail have failed to comply with t.heir undertaking 
Where the undertaking was given in an action to recover a chattel, an
action may be brought thereupon, at any time after the retum, wholly
or partly unsatisfied, or an execution for the delivery of the possession
of the chattel, with respect . to which the order of arrest was granted.
In any other case, an action cannot be brought, as prescribed in the
last section, until the following requisites have been complied with : 
1. An execution, against the property of the defendant, must have
been i8sued to the sheriff of the county in which he was arrested, and
retumed by that sheriff', wholly or partly unsatisfied. 
2. An execution, against the person of the defendant, must have
been issued to the same sheriff, and by him returned, not less than
fifteen days after its receipt, to the effect that the defendant could not
be found within his county. 
§ 598. The sheriff must diligently endeavor to enforce an execution
issued and delivered to him, as prescribed in the last section, notwith­
standing any direction he may receive Crom the plaintiff' or his attorney, 
§ 599. In an action against bail, it is a defence, that an execution.
against the property, or against the person, of the defendant in the orig- 
inal action, was not issued, as prescribed in section five hundred and 
ninety-seven of this act; or that it was not issued in sufficient time to 
enable the sheriff' to enforce it; or that a direction was given, or other
fraudulent or collusive means were used, by the plaintiff or bis attorney,
to prevent the service thereof. 
§ 600. If the defendant in the ori~nal action, after his discharge 
OJ?<>~ bail, is imprisoned, e~tb~r within ~r ~itbout the State, upon. a
criminal charge, or a conviction of a criminal offence, the court, m 
which an action against the bail is pending, ma_y, before the expiration
of the time to answer, and upon notice to the adverse party, make such 
an order for the relief of the bail, as justice requires.
§ 601. Except in an action to recover a chattel, the bail must be 
exonerated where either of the following events occurs, before the expi-
ration of the time to answer in an action against them : 
1. The death of the original defendant.
2. His legal dischar~e from the obligation to render himself amen­ 
able to the process, direction, or proceedings, with respect to which
the undertaking of the bail was made. 
8. His surrender to the sheriff" of the county where he was arrested, 
aa prescribed in this article.
Where either event occurs, after the commencement of the action 
against the bail, the court may, in its discretion, impose the payment 
of the plaintiff's costs and expenses, incurred after the return of the
execution against the person, as a condition of allowing the exonera­
ti.on. And the court may, by an order, made upon notice to the adverse
p'lrty, grant such further time as it deems just, after answer, for the
surrender of the original defendant. In that case, his surrender, within
the time so granted, has the same effect, as if it had been made before 
answer.

or continuance of which, during the pendency of the action, would
produce injury to the plaintiff, an injunction order may be granted to 
restrain it. The case, provided for in this section, is described in this
act, as a case where the right to an injunction depends upon the nature 
of the action.
§ 604. In either of the following cases, an injunction order may also 
be granted in an action :
1. Where it appears, by affidavit, that the defendant, during the 
pendency of the action, is doing, or procuring, or suffering to be done,
or threatens, or is about to do, or to procure, or suffer to be done, an
act, in violation of the plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the
action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, an injunction
order may be granted to restrain him therefrom. 
2. Where it appears, by affidavit, that the defendant, during the
pendeney of the action, threatens, or is about to remove, or to dispose
of his property, with intent to defraud the plaintiff, an injunction order
may be granted, to restrain the removal or disposition. 
§ 605. Where a duty is imposed by statute upon a State officer, 01 
board of State officers, an injunction order to restrain him or them, or
a person employed by him or them, from the performance of that duty, 
or to prevent the execution of the statute, shall not be granted, except
by the supreme court, at a general term thereof, sitting in the depart­
ment in which the officer or board is located, or the duty is required to
be performed ; and upon notice of the application therefor to the officer,
board, or other person to be restrained. 
§ 606. Except where it is otherwise specially prescribed by law, av
injunction order may be granted by the court in which the action is
brought, or by a judge thereof, or by any county judge; and where it 
is granted by a judge, it may be enforced as the order of the court.

judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or any other person, that suffi­ 
cient grounds exist therefor.
§ 608. The order may be granted to accompany the summons, or at 
any time after the commencement of the action, and before final jud­
ment. 
§ 609. The order may be granted, upon or without notice in the dis­
retion of the court or judge, unless the defendant has answered; in 
hich case, it can be granted only upon notice, or an order to show
cause. Where an application for an injunction is made upon notice,
or an order to show cause, either before or after answer, the court or
[udge may enjoin the defendant, until the hearing and decision of the 
pplication.

injunction. Where it is granted by the court, it must be served by

States, the sheriff may ]evy upon the sum remaining unpaid upou a
subscription to the capital stock of the corporation, made by a person 
within the county; or upon one or more shares of stock therein, held
by such a person, or transferred by him, for the purpose of avoiding
payment thereof. 
§ 647. The rights or shares which the defendant has in the stock of~d.:
an association or corporation, together with the interests and protits~~tr~u~4:.· 
thereon, may be levied upon; and the sheriff's certificate of the sale,
thereof entitles the purchaser to the same rights and privileges, with
respect thereto, which the defendant had, when they were so attached. 
§ 648. The attachment may also by levied upon a cause of action 
arising upon contract] including a bond, promissory note, or other[ot.e,
instrument for the payment of money only, negotiable, or other- 
wise, whether past due, or yet to become due, executed by a
foreign or domestic government, State, county, public officer, asso-
ciation, municipal or other corporation, or by a private person,
either within or without the State; which belongs to the defeudant,

and is found within the county. The levy of the attach-
ment thereupon is deemed a levy upon, and a seizure and attachment
of, the debt represented thereby. 
§ 649. A levy under a warrant of attachment must be made as
follows · 
  
1. Upon real property, by fi.hng with the clerk of the county, where:
it is situated, a notice of the attachment, stating the names of the par-:
ties to the action, the amount of the plaintiff's claim, as stated in the
warrant, and a description of the particular property levied upon. The;
notice must be subscribed by the plaintiff's attorney, adding his office
address ; and must be recorded and indexed by the clerk, iu the same
book, in like manner, and with/ike effect, as the notice of the pendency 
or au action. 
2. Upon personal property, capable of manual delivery, including a
bond, promissory note, or other instrument for the payment of money,
by taking the same into the sheriff's actual custody. He must there­
upon, without. delay, deliver to the person from whose possession the
property is taken, if any a copy of the warrant, and of the affidavits 
upon which it was grant.ed.
8. Upon other personal property, by leaving a certified copy of the 
warrant, and a notice showing the property attached, with the person
holding the same; or, if it eonsists of a demand, other than as specified
in the last subdivision, with the person against whom it exists; or, if
it consists of a right or share in the stock of an association or corpora­
tion, or interest or profits thereon, with the president, or other head of
the association or corporation, or the secretary, cashier, or managing 
agent thereof. 
§ 650. Upon the application of a sheriff, holding a warrant of attach­
ment, the president or other bead of an association or corporation, or 
the secretary, cashier, or managing agent thereof, or a debtor of the
defendant, or a person holding property, inclnding a bond, promissory 
note, or other instrument for the payment of money, belonging to the
defendant, must furnish to the sheriff a certificate, under his hand,
specifying the rights or number of shares of the defendant, in the
stock of the association or corporation, with all dividends declared, or
incumbrances thereon; or the amount, nature, and description of the
property, held for the benefit of the defendant, or of the defendant's
interest in property so held, or of the debt or demand owing to the
defendant, as the case requires. . 
§ 651. If a person, to whom application is made, as prescribed in the
ast section, refuses to give such a certificate ; or if it is made to appear, 
y affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, or a judge therecf, or the
ounty judge of the county to which the warrant is issued, that there 
s reason to suspect that a certificate given by him is untrue, or that it
ails fully to set forth the facts, required to be shown thereby; the
ourt or judge may make an order, directing him to attend, at a speci­
. eel time, and at a place within the county to which the warrant is 
lssued, and submit to an examination under oath, concerning the same.
trhe order may, in the discretion of the court or judge, direct an appear­
ance before a referee named therein. 
§ 652. Except as olherwisejrescribed in the next section, the owner
or master o a vessel, on boar of which goods of a e en. ant, against
whom a warrant of attachment is issued, have been shipped for trans­
portation, without reshipment or transshipment in the State, to a pod
or place without the State, may transport and deliver them according
to their destination, notwithstanding the warrant ; unless the plaintiff,
his agent, or attorney, executes to the owner or the master of the vessel,
a written undertaking, with sufficient sureties, in a sum specified
therein, to pay him all expenses, damages, and charges, which may be 
incurred by him, or to which he may be subjected, for unlading the
goods from the vessel, and for all necessary detention of the vessel, for
that purpose. The undertaking must be approved, with respect to its
form, the sum specified therein, and the sufficiency of the sureties, by 
a judge of the court, or the county judge of the county wherein the
vessel is situated, or, in the city and county of New-York, by a judge
of a superior city court within that cit.y and county. 
§ 653. The last section does ·not apijlY, where the owner or master,
before the shipment of the goods, had actual information of the grant­
in~ of the warrant, or where be has, in any wise, connived at, or been 
privy to, the shipment thereof, for the purpose of screening them from
legal process, or of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors. 
§ 654. lie sberi must, immediately after levying under a warrant
of attachment, make, with the assistance of two disinterested freehold- 
e1'8, a description of the real property, and a jnst and true inventory
of the personal property, upon which it was levied, and of the books, 
vouchers, and other papers taken into his custody, stating therein the
estimated value of each parcel of real property attached, or of the
mterest of the defendant therein, and of each article of personal prop-
erty, enumerating such of the latter as are perishable. The inventory
must be signed by the sheriff' and the appraisers; and runst within
five days after the levy, be filed in the office of the clerk of the county,
where the property is attached. 
§ 655. The sheriff must, subject to the direction of the court or jndge
collect and receive all debts, effects, and things in action, attached by
him. He may maintain any action or special proceeding, in his own
name, or in the name of the defendant, which is uecessary, for that
purpose, or to reduce to his actual possession an article of personal
property, capable of manual delivery, but of which be has been unable
to obtain possession. And he may discontinue such an action or special
procee.iiug, at such time and on such terms, as the court or judge
direct.s. 
§ 656. If property attached, other than a vessel, is perishable, the
court or judge may, by an order, made with or without notice, as the 
urgency of the case, in its or his opinion, requires, direct the sheriff to
sell it at public auction; and thereupon the sheriff must sell it ac­
cordingly. If it consists of Jive animals the same proceedings may be
bad, but such notice shall be given to the parties to the action, of the
application for the order as the court or judge prescribes. The order
directing the sale must prescribe the time and place of the sale, and
notice thereof, must be given in such manner, and for such time as
is prescribed in the order. The sheriff' must retain in his hands the
proceeds of the sale, after deducting his expenses, as allowed by the
court or judge. 
§ 657. If the goods or effects, other than a vessel, attached as the prop-
erty of the defendant, are claimed by or in behalf of another person,
as his property, the sheriff may, in his discretion, empanel a jury to 
try the validity of the claim.
§ 658. If, by their inquisition, the jury find the property of the goods 
or effects to have been in the claimant at the time of the levy, the
sheriff must forthwith deliver them to him or bis agent; unless the 
plaintiff gives an undertaking, with sufficient suret.ies, to indemnify
the sheriff for the detention thereof. If t.he undertaking is given, the
sneriff must detain the goods or effects, as the property of the defendant. 
§ 659. If the property is found to be in the defendant, the findingJvinding
does not prejndice the right of the r.~aimant to bring an action, to re-~;it: 
cover the goods or effects, or the value thereof.
§ 660. Where a vessel, belonging to a port or place in the United 
States, or a share or interest therein, is attached, the court or judge, on
the application, wit~in thirty days th~reaft.er, ~f 8; :person claiming title thereto, or of his agent, must appoint three indifferent persons to 
make a valuation thereof. 
§ 661. A valuation of a vessel, or of a share or interest therein, made
as prescribed in this article must be in writing, and subscribed by the 
appraisers ; each of whom must take and subscribe au affidavit, an-
nexed thereto, to the effect, that the valuation is, in all respects, just
and fair, and that the value of the vessel, share, or interest, is truly 
121 
stated therein, according to the deponent's belief. The valuation must
be immediately returned to the court or judge; and, after au under­
taking is given, or after the expiration of the time to give an undertak­
ing, as prescribed in the next section, it must be delivered to the 
sheriff. · 
§ 662. Within two days after the valuation is returned, the claimant
or bis agent may execute an undertaking to the sheriff, with sufficient
sureties, approved by the court or judge, who must justify in twice the
appraised value, to the effect, that, in an action to be brought on the
undertaking, the claimant will establish that be was the owner of the 
vessel, share or interest, at the time of the levy thereupon ; and that, 
in case of his failure to do so, be will pay the amount of the valuation,
with interest from the date of the undertaking, to the sheriff; or, if the
warrant is vacated or annuled, to the defendant, or bis personal repre­
sentative. 
§ 668. Upon such an undertaking being executed and delivered to 
the sheriff, the court or judge must make an order, directing the vessel 
or share to be discharged from the attachment. Thereupon the sheriff'
must discharge the same accordingly. 
§ 664. The court or judge may, upon the application of either party,
at auy time before the warrant is vacated o-r annulled, direct the sheriff 
to commence au action upon the undertaking, upon such terms and
conditions, and under such regulations, between him and the appli­
cant, as it or be deems just. And if the warrant of attachment is
vacated or annulled, the defendant in the attachment, bis assignee or
personal representative, may commence and maintain an action upon
the undertaking, or may be substituted, in place of the sheriff, in an
action pending thereupon. 
§ 665. In such an action, the claimant may show, in bar of a recovery,
that he was the owner of the vessel, share, or interest at the time
when it was attached. If judgment passes against him, the plaintiff 
is entitled to recover the amount of the valuation, with interest from 
the date of the undertaking.
§ 666. Where a foreign vessel, or a share or interest therein, is 
attached, it must be valued, as prescribed in sections six hundred and
sixty and six hundred and sixty-one of this act, upon the application
of a. person, who makes affidavit, to the effect that he is the owner
thereof, or that he is the agent of a person, naming him and bis resi­
dence, whom be believes to be the owner of the vessel, share or interest 
attached. 
§ 667. Such notice of the application must be given to the plaintiff, 
as the court or judge deems reasonable.
§ 668. Within three days after the valuation i8 returned, the plaintiff 
must give, to the person in whose behalf the claim is made, an under­
taking, with sufficient sureties, approved by the court or judge, who 
must jnstify in twice the appraised value, to the effect that they will 
pay such damages as may be recovered for seizing the vessel, share, or
interest, in an action brought against the sheriff, or the plaintiff iu the
attachment, within three months from the approval of the undertaking,
if it appears therein that the vessel, share, or interest belonged, at the
time of attaching it, to the person in whose behalf the claim is made. 
§ 669. Unless such an undertaking is given, the court or judge must
grant an order discharging the vessel, share, or interest 80 claimed, 
from the attachment; whereupon the sheriff must discharge the same
accordingly 
§ 670. If, after such an undertaking is given by the plaintiff', the
warra.ut is vacated or annulled, or the attachment is discharged as to
the vessel, share or interest, the defendant or his agent is entitled to 
claim the same, or the proceeds thereof, if it has been sold, only upon
his showing, to the satisfaction of the court or judge, that the under-
taking bas been discharged; or giving to the plaintiff an undertakiug,
with sufficient sureties, approved by the court or judge, who must jus-
tify in twice the appraised value, to the effect, that they will indemnify
the plaintiff against all charges and expenses, in consequence of the 
u ndertakiug. 
§ 671. If the undertaking of the plaintiff is not discharged, or he is
not indemnified, as prescribed in this article, within one month after
the defendant becomes entitled to claim the vessel, share, or interest,
as so prescribed, it may be sold by the sheriff, in whose custody it is,
upon an order of the court or judge ; and the proceeds of the sale must
be pa.id to the persons who executed the undertaking, for their indem-
nity. 
§ 672. If a claim is not made, by or in behalf of an owner of a do-
mestic vessel, or of a share or interest therein, within thirty days after
it is attached, or if the proper undertaking is not executed by the
claimant ; or if a claim is not made, within that time, by or iu behalf
of the owner of a foreign vessel, or of a share or interest therein; the
vessel, share, or interest, may be sold by the sheriff, under an order of
the court or judge, upon the application of the plaintiff, if, in the opin-
ion of the court or judge, a sale is necessary. 
§ 673. Where a share or interest in a vessel, foreign or domestic, is
attached, if the proper claim to it is not made, by or in behalf of an
owner thereof, within thirty days thereafter, it may be sold by the
sheriff, under an order of the court or judge, upon the application of a
joint owner, or his agent. 
§ 674. The sheriff must keep the property attached by him, or the
proceeds of property sold, or of a demand collected by him, to answer
any judgment that may be obtained against the defendant in the
action. 
§ 675. But the court upon the application of either party to the
action, may direct the sheriff, either before or after the expiration of 
his term of office, to pay into court the proceeds of a demand collected,
or property sold ; or to deposit them in a designated bank or trust 
company, to be drawn out only upon the order of the conrt. .
§ 676. Where the proceeds of the property sold, and of the demands 
collected by the sheriff, exceed the amount of the plaintiff's demand,
with the costs and expenses, and of all other warrants of attachment
or executions in the sheriff's hands, chargeable upon the same ; the
court, or the judge who granted the warrant, upon the application of
the defendant, or of an assignee of, or purchaser from the defendant,
and upon notice to the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs in the other war-
rants or executions, may, at any time during the pendency of the action,
make an order, directing the sheriff to pay over· the surplus to the
applicant, and to release from the attachment the remaining real and
personal property attached. . 
§ 677. The plaintiff, by leave of the court or judge, procured as pre-
scribed in the next section, may bring and maintain, in the name of him- 
self and the sheriff jointly, by his own attorney, and at his own expense,
any action which, by the provisions of this title, may be brought by
the sheriff, to recover property attached, or the value thereof, or a de- 
mand attached, or upon an undertaking given as prescribed in this title, by a person other than the plaintiff. The sheriff must receive the
proceeds of such an action, but he is not liable for the costs or expenses
thereof. Costs may be awarded, in such an action, against the plain­
tiff in the warrant, but not against the sheriff. 
§ 678. The court or judge must grant leave to bring such an action,
where it appears, that due notice of the application therefor has been 
given to the sheriff; but, before doing so, the court or judge may require
that notice of the application be given to the plaintiff, in any other war­ 
rant against the same defendant. And such terms, conditions, and
regulations may be imposed, in the order granting leave, as the court
or judge thinks proper, for the due protection of the rights and interests
of all persons, interested in the disposition of the proceeds of the action. 
§ 679. Leave may, in like manner and with like effect, be granted to
the plaintiff in the warrant, to be joined with the sheriff, in an action
bronght by the sheriff, in a case where he might have procured leave
to bring the action, as prescribed in the last two sections. Upon an ap-
plication therefor, the court or judge may, in a proper case, require the
plaintiff' to provide for the expenses in the action, already incurred by
the sheriff. The application must be denied, in case of an unreasona­
ble delay in making it; or where an application was made, before the
action was brought, and the plaintiff neglected or refused, without a
good excuse therefor, to comply with the terms, conditions or regula ..
tions then imposed. 
§ 680. The court or judge may, upon the application of the sheriff,
or of the defendant in the warrant, during the peudency of an action, 
brought as prescribed in the last three sections, direct as to the con­
duct, discontinuance, or settlement of the same, and as to the applica-
tion or disposition of the money or property recovered therein, as jus­ 
tice requires.
§ 681. Upon the application of either party, and proof of tbe neglect 
of the sheriff, the court or judge may, by order, require the sheriff to
return an inventory. Disobedience to such an order may be punished, 
as a contempt of the court.

the actual application of the attached property, or the proceeds thereof; 
to the payment of a judgment recovered in the action, apply to vacate
~r modify the warrant, or to increase the security, given by the plaintiff', 
or for one or more of those forms of relief, together, or in the alternative. 
§ 683. An application, specified in the last section, may be founded 
only upon the papers upon which the warrant was granted; in which 
case, it must, be made to the court, or, if the warrant was granted by
a judge out of court, to the same judge, iu court or out of court, and 
with or without. notice, as he deems proper. Or it may be founded
upon proof, by affidavit, on the part of the defendant ; in which case,
it must be made to the court, or,.if the warrant was granted by a judge
out of court, to any judge of the court; upon notice ; and it may be
opposed by new proof, by a.flida.vit, on the part of the plaintiff', tending 
to sustain any ground for the attachment, recited in the warrant, and
uo other, unless the defendant relies upon a. discharge in bankruptcy,
or upon a discharge or exoneration, granted in insolvent proceedings;
in which case, the plaintiff may show any matter, in avoidance thereof,
which he: might show upon the trial. 
§ 686. Tue denial of such an application does not prejudice a subse- 
qnent application, *seasonable made, founded upon tbe failure of a
complaint, which had not been filed or served at the time of the former 
application, to set forth anyof tbe causes of.action, mentioned in section
aix hundred and thirty-five aud section six hundred and thirty-seven
of this act. 
§ 687. The defendant may, at any time after he has appeared in the
action, and before final judgment, apply to the judge who granted the 
warrant, or to the court for an order to discharge the attachment, as to 
the whole or a part of the property attached.
§ 688. Upon such an application, the defendant must give an under- 
'taking, with at least. two sufficient sureties, to the effect that he will,
on demand, pay to the plaintiff the amount of any judgment which
may be recovered in the action against him, not exceeding a sum speci-
fied in the. undertaking, with interest. The sum so specified must be 
at least equal to the amount of the plaintiff 'a demand, as specified in
his affidavit; or, a.t the option of the defendant, equal to the appraised
value, according to the inventory, of the property attached; or, if the 
_ application is to discharge the attachment, as to a part only of the
property attached, to the appraised value of that portion. 
§ 689. Where there are two or more defendants, and an application
is made, as prescribed in the last two sections, by one or more, but not 
by all of them, the undertaking must provide for the payment of any
judgment, which may be recovered agaiu.st any or the. defendants in
the action, unless the applicant makes proof, by affidavit, to the satis-
factiou of the court or [udge.. that the property, with respect to which 
th:e application is made, belongs to him separately; in which case, the
undertaking must provide for the payment of any judgment, which
may be recovered in the action age.inst the applicant, either alone or 
jointly with any other defendant. Where an application is made, as
prescribed in this section, at least two days notice thereof, with a copy
of the affidavit, must be served upon the ; laintitf's attorney, who may
oppose the application by proof, by affidavit, that one or more of the
other defendants own, or have an interest in the property. 
§ 690. An undertaking, given as prescribed in the last two sections, 
must be forthwith filed with the clerk. A copy thereof, with a notice
of the filing must be forthwith served upon the plaintiff's attomey; 
who may, within tJna. d&Ji .Jbereafter, give notice to the sheriff, that
he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. Thereupon the sureties 
must justify, upon the like notice, and in like manner, as bail upon an
arrest; or a new undertaking must be given, with new sureties, who
must justify in like manner. If the plaintiff does not except, as pre­
scribed in this section, be is deemed to have waived all objection to
the sureties. 
§ 691. The sheriff is responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties:
and he may retain possession of the property attached, and the pro­ 
ceeds thereof, until the objection to them is waived, as prescribed in
the last section, or they, or the new sureties, justify. 
§ 692. The last five sections are applicable, where a vessel, or a
share or interest therein is attached. If it is necessary, to enable the
defendant to discharge the attachment, the court or judge may, by 
order, stay any proceedings specified in article second of this title, or
extend the time to do any act therein specified. 
§ 693. If a warrant of attachment is levied upon the interest of one
or more partners, in goods or chattels of a partnership, the other part­ 
ners, who are not defendants in the action, or any of them, may at
any time before final judgment, apply to the judge who granted the
warrant, or to the court, upon an affidavit showing the facts, for an
order to discharge the attachment, as to that interest. 
§ 694. Upon such an application, the applicant must give an under­
taking, with at least two sufficient sureties, to the effect that they will
pay to the sheriff, on demand, the amount of any judgment, which
may be recovered against the partner who is defendant in the action ;
or which may be recovered age.inst him, in any other action, wherein
the other partners are not defendants, and wherein a warrant of
attachment, or an execution, may come to the sheriff's bands, at any
time before the warrant of attachment, which was so levied, is vacated
or annulled; not exceeding e. sum, specified in the undertaking, which
must not be less than the value of the interest of the defendant, in the
goods or chattels seized by virtue of the attachment, as fixed by the
court or judge; if the value, in the opinion of the court or judge, is 
uncertain, the sum shall be such as the court or judge determines. 
§ 695. For the purpose of fixing the sum, or determining the suf-
ficiency of the sureties, the court or judge may receive affidavits or 
oral testimony, or may direct a reference. · 
§ 696. The court or judge may direct, that the plaintiff have notice
of an application for a discharge of property, as prescribed in this article, or of the hearing under an order of reference, made as pre­

defendant, are delivered to the sheriff of the same county, to be
executed, their respective· preferences, and the rules, where a levy, or
a. levy and sale, have been made under a junior warrant, are the same, 
as where two or more executions, against the property of the same de­
fendant, are delivered to the sheriff of the same county, to be executed. 
§ 698. Where a domestic vessel, or a share or interest therein, has
been attached, and afterwards released, as prescribed in this title; or 
where the personal property of a partnership, of which the defendant
was a member, bas been attached, and the attachment afterwards dis­
charged, upon the application of another partner, as prescribed in this title; another warrant, against the same defendant, shall not be levied
on the same property, by the sheriff of the same or of any other county,
until after the first warrant has been vacated or annulled. But, except
as thus prescribed, where a second warrant, against the same defend-
ant, is delivered to the same sheriff, he must execute it, by a levy upon
property within his county, and he must thereupon take the same pro­
ceedings, as if the levy was made under the first warrant. 
§ 701. Where a foreign vessel, or a share or interest therein, bas been
ttached and valued, as prescribed in article second of this title, and 
the plaintiff', in the first warrant of attachment, fails to give an under-
taking to prevent the release thereof, the court or judge may grant to
the plaintiff' in a second warrant, then in the sheriff's hands for execu-
tion, an extension, of not more than three days thereafter, within which 
to furnish an undertaking, in all respects like the one to be furnished
by the first plaintiff. And if he furnishes it, within that time, he has
the same rights and privileges, and is subject to the same duties and
liabilities, with respect to the vessel and its proceeds, and the subse-
quent proceedings relating thereto, as if his was the first warrant. 
§ 702. If a foreign vessel, or a share or interest therein, has been
attached, and afterwards released, by reason of the failure of the 
plaintiff', in the first or the second warrant, to give an undertaking to
prevent .the release, it shall not be again attached, under warrant 
against the same defendant, which had been delivered to the sheriff'
of the same county, before the expiration of the time within which the
nndertaking should have been furnished. But it may be again attached,
under a subsequent warrant against the same defendant; in which case, 
the plaintiff therein, and the plaintiff in each warrant subsequently
delivered to the sheriff, have the same rights, and privileges, and are
subject to the same duties and liabilities, with respect to the veesel and
its proceeds, and the subsequent proceedings relating thereto, as if the
warrant, under which it was attached, was the first warrant. 
§ 703. Where the plaintiff' in a warrant of attachment has com­
menced an action, in the name of himself and the sheriff jointly, as
prescribed in this title, a plaintiff in a junior warrant may apply to the 
court or judge, to direct as to the conduct, discontinuance, or settle­
ment of the same, or to impose terms, conditions, and regulations as to
the continuance thereof, in the interest of the applicant; and such
order may be made thereupon, as justice requires. If the first warrant
is vacated, or the attachment thereunder is released or discharged, with­
out affecting the cause of action prosecuted by the plaintiff' therein and
the sheriff jointly, the plaintiff in the warrant next in order, may, upon
his own application, be substituted as joint plaintiff' with the sheriff,
by an order, made as upon an application for leave to bring such an 
action.
§ 704. A plaintiff in a second warrant may apply to the court or 
judge, upon notice to the plaintiff in the first warrant, and to the
sheriff', for leave to bring and maintain, in the name of himself and the
sheriff joint.ly, any action, which might be brought in the name of the
senior plaintiff and the sheriff. If it appears that the plaintiff in the
first warrant neglects or refuses to be joined with the sheriff in such
an action, or to comply with the terms; conditions, and regulations,
imposed, either upon granting him an order for that purpose, or upon
the hearing of an application, made as prescribed in this section, the
court or judge may grant to the plaintiff in the second warrant, leave 
to bring and maintain such an action, in the name of himself and the
sheriff jointly, with like effect, as if his was the first warrant. 
§ 705. Where there are more than two warrants of attachment,
against the same defendant, the plaintiffs in the third and each sub­
sequent warrant have, according to their respective priorities, the same
rights and privileges, as against the plaintiffs in all senior warrants,
which the plaintiff in the second warrant has, 88 against the plaintiff
in the first, and are subject to the same duties and liabilities; except
that a second extension of the time, within which to furnish an under­
taking to prevent the release of a foreign vessel, or a share or interest
thereiu, shall not be granted. And the plaintiffs in two or more junior
warrants of attachment, may, by agreement among themselves, take
jointly, and for their common benefit, any proceeding, permitted by
this title to be taken, by the plaintiff in a second or subsequent warrant
of attachment ; provided that it does not interfere with the preferential
or other right of an intermediate plaintiff.

§ 706. Where a levy, under a warrant of attachment in an action,
has been made, an execution against property, upon a final judgment~
in favor of the plaintiff therein, recovered after the expiration of the
term of office of the sheriff, who made the ]evy, must nevertheless be 
directed to an* executed by that sheriff, unless another person is des-
ignated by law to complete the unfinished business pertaining to his
office; or, in that. case, to the person so designated. 
§ 707. Where a defendant who has not appeared is a non-resident of
the state, or a foreign corporation, and the summons was served with- 
out the State, or by publication, pursuant to an order obtained for that
purpose, as prescribed in chapter fifth of this act, the judgment can be
enforced only against the property which has been levied upon, by
virtue of the warrant of attachment, at the time when the judgment
is enter ed. ht t.his section does not declare the effect of such a judg­
ment, with respect to the application of any statute of limitationx 
§ 708. Where an execution against property is issued upon a Jndg-ttr°e~t
ment for the plaintiff, in an action in which a warrant of attachment 
has been levied, the sheriff must satisfy it, as follows:
1. He must pay over to the plaintlff all 111011ey attached by him, 
and all proceeds of the sales of perishable property, or of auy vessel,
or share or interest therein, or animals, sold by him, or of any debts or
other things in action collected or sold by him; or so much thereof as
is neceseary to satisfy the judgment. 
2. If any balance remains due, he must sell, under the execution,
the other personal property attached, or so much thereof as is neces­
sary; including rights or shares in the stock of an association or cor­
poration, or a bond or other instrument for the payment of money,
executed and issued with the interest coupons annexed, if any, by a
government., State, county, public officer, or municipal or other eorpor­
ation, which is in terms negotiable, or payable to the bearer. or holder,
the principal whereof is not then payable; but not including any
other debt or thing in action. If the proceeds of that property are
insufficient to satisfy the judgment, and the execution requires him to
satisfy it out of any other personal property of the defendant, he must
sell the personal property, upon which he has levied by virtue of the
execution. If the proceeds of the personal property, applicable to the
execution, are insufficient to satisfy the judgment, the sheriff must sell,
under the execution, all the right, title, and interest, which the defend­
ant had in the real property attached, at the time when the notice was
fl.led, or at any time afterwards, before resorting to any other real 
property.
3. If personal property attached, belonging to the defendant, has 
passed out of the hands of the sheriff without having been sold or
converted into money, and the attachment has not been discharged, as 
to that property, he must, if practicable, regain possession thereof;
and, for that purpose, he has all the authority which he had, to seize
the same under the warrant. If{.. person who wilfully conceals or with­
holds such property from him, M.ab]e to double damages, at the suit 
of the party aggrieved,) 
4. Until the judgment is paid, he may collect the debts and other
things in action attached, and prosecute any undertaking, which he
has taken in the course of the proceedings, and apply the proceeds
thereof to the payment of the judgment. 
5. At any time after levying the attachment, the court, upon the
petition of the plaintiff, accompanied with an affidavit, specifying
fully all . the proceedings of the ~he riff, since the levy under the war­
rant, the property attached, and the disposition thereof; and the
affidavit of the sheriff, showing that he has used diligence, in endesv­
oring to collect the debts and other things· in action attached, and tbai
a portion thereof remains uncollected ; may direct the sheriff to sell
the remaining portion, upon such terms, and in such manuer, as U
thinks proper. 'Notice of the application must be given to the defend­
ant's attorney, if the defendant appeared in the action. If the sum­
mons was not personally served on the defendant, and he did no,
appear, the court may make such order as to the service of notice, as ii 
thinka proper ; or may grant the application without notice.
§ 709. Where a warrant of attachment is vacated, or annulled, or an 
attachment is discharged, upon the application of the defendant, the
sheriff must, except in a case where it is otherwise specially prescribed 
by law, deliver over to the defendant, or to the person entitled thereto,
upon reasonable demand, and upon payment of all costs, charges, and ex- 
penses, legally chargeable by the sheriff, all the attached personal property
remaining in his hands, or that portion thereof, as to which the attach­
ment is discharged ; or the proceeds thereof, if it has been sold by him. 
§ 710. Where the sheriff is required, by this title, to deliver attac~ed
property, or the proceeds thereof, to the defendant, he must also dehver 
to him, unless otherwise specially directed by the court or judge, all 
books of account, vouchers, evidences of debt, muniments of title, or
other papers, relating to the property, either real or personal, or to its
proceeds ; together with all undertakings, relating thereto, which he
has taken in the course of the proceedings, and which have not been
fully satisfied; except an undertaking, given by the defendant, upon
the discharge of property. He must also deliver a written assignment
duly acknowledged, of each undertaking, so delivered, and of each 
other instrument, to which the defendant is thus entitled, au assi~­
ment of which is necessary to perfect or protect the defendant's title
thereto. CJ:lle defendant must also, but upon his own application only,
be substituted in the place of the sheriff, or the sheriff and the plaintiff
jointly, in an action brought as prescribed in this title') but the court
or jndge may impose, as a condition of granting the o:r«er of substitution,
such terms as justice requires, with respect to indemnity and payment
of expenses. The defendant's rights, with respect to property attached
and not disposed of, and an undertaking, or other instrument, to which
he is thus entitled, are the same as those of the sheriff while the war-
rant was still in force, except where his rights are specially defined or
regulated by law. 
§ 711. At any time _after the warrant of _attachment has been vacated
or annulled, or the attachment has been discharged as to real prorerty 
~ttached, t.h_e court may, in its discl:'tion, _upon the.appli~ation o any
person aggrieved, and upon such notice as 1t deems Just, direct that any
notice, 'flied for the purpose of attaching the property, be cancelled of
record, by the clerk of the county where it is filed and recorded. The
cancellation must be made by -a 'Dote, to that effect, on the margin of 
the record, referring to the order ; and, unlese the order is entered in 
the eame olerk'e office, a certified copy thereof must, at the 88.Dle time,
be flied therein. 
§ 712. Where a warrant of attachment hes been vacated or annulled,
the sheriff muet forthwith file, in the clerk's office, the w~nt, with a 
Teturn of his prooeedinge thereon. Upon the application of either
~y, and plOOf of the sheriff's neglect, the court mav direet him 80 
to do, forthwith, or within a specified time.

easual or involuntary personal injury, or a like injury to pror.erty; the

demand; together with the cps~ of the action, to that time. 
§ 732. A. tender, made as prescribed in the last section, does not
avail the defendant, unless the money is accepted,· or is paid into court,

.out the amount paid in he accepts the tender. 
§ 733. If it appears, upon the trial, that the sum so tendered was
sufficient to pay the plaintiff's demand, or to make amends for the
injury, and also to pay the costs of the action, to the time of the ten-
der, the plaintiff cannot recover costs or interest, from the time of the
tender, but must pay the defendant's costs from that time, 
§ 734. If the plaintiff J>rOceeds in the action, after accepting the
tender, the sum accepted must be deducted from the recovery, and
judgment rendered for the residue, if any ; and if the tender and
acceptance do not appear In the pleadings, a memorandum thereof
must be annexed to the judgment-roll. The plaintiff's right to recover
costs, and his liability to pq.y costs to the defendant, are determined
by the amount of the residue. 
§ 735. The attorney for & party may, at any' time before the trial,
exhibit to the attorney for the adverse party, a paper, material to the
action, and request a written admission of its genuineness. If the ad- 
mission is not ¢ven, within four days after the request, and the paper 
is proved or admitted on the trial, the expenses, incurred by the party
exhibiting it, in order to prove its genuitieness, must be ascertained at
the trial, and paid by the party refusing the admission ; unless it
appears, to the satisfaction of the court, that there was a good reason
for the ref usal, 
§ 736. In an action to recover damages for breach of a contract, the
efendant's attorney may, with the answer, serve upon the plaintiff's 
ttorney, a written offer, that, if the defendant fails in his defence, the
amages may be assessed at a specified sum. If the plaintiff serves 
iotice, that he accepts the offer, with or before the notice of trial, and
amages are awarded to him on the trial, they must be assessed accord­ 
ngly. 
§ 737. Ir the plaintiff does not accept the offer, he cannot prove it,
upon the trial. But if the dam~es, awarded to him, do not exceed
the sum offered, the defendant is entitled to recover the expenses. 
necessarily incurred by him in preparing for the trial of the question
of damages. The expenses must be ascertained, and the amount
thereof determined, by the judge, or the referee, by or before whom
the cause is tried. · 
§ 738. The defendant may, before the trial, serve upon the plaintiff's
ttorney, a. written offer, to allow judgment to be taken against him,
or a sum, or property, or to the effect, therein specified, with costs. 
f there are two or more defendants, and the action can be severed, a like
ffer may be made by one or more defendants, against whom a separate 
udgment may be taken. If the plaintiff, within ten days thereafter,
erves upon the defendant's attorney, a written notice that he accepts 
be offer, he may file the summons, complaint, and offer, with proof of
cceptance, and thereupon the clerk must enter judgment accordingly.
f notice of acceptance is not thus given, the offer cannot be given in
vidence upon the trial ; but, if the plaintiff fails to obtain a more 
avorable judgment, he cannot recover costs from the time of the offer,
ut must, pay costs from t.hat. time. 
§ 739. Where the defendant sets up a counterclaim, to an amount
greater than the plaintiff's claim, or sufficient to reduce the plaintiff's
recovery below fifty dollars, the plaintiff may serve, upon the defend­
ant's attorney, a written offer, to allow judgment to be taken against
him, for a specified sum, with coats, or against the defendant for a
specified sum, and against the plaintiff for costs. If the defendant,
within ten days thereafter, serves, upon the plaintiff's attorney, notice
that he accepts the offer, eit.her party may file the summons, complaint,
answer, and offer, or copies thereof and proof of acceptance; and
thereupon the clerk must enter judgment accordingly. If notice of
acceptance is not thus given, the offer cannot be given in evidence,
upon the trial ; but, if the recovery is not more favorable to the de­
fendant than that so offered, he will not be entitled to recover costs
from the time of the offer, but must pay costs from that time. 
§ 740. UnleBB an offer or an acceptance, made as prescribed in either
f the last four sections, is subscribed by the party making it, bis
ttomey must subscribe it and annex thereto his affidavit, to the effect
bat he is duly authorized to make it, in behalf of the party.

vestment of money paid into court, must be taken to the county trea-
surer of the county where the fund belongs, in his name of office; or to 
such other county treasurer, as the court specially directs. But this
and the next eection do not prevent the court, upon the application of
a party to an action, from directing in what manner or place, money,
paid into court in the action, shall be deposited or invested. 
§ 746. Provision may be made, in the general rules of practice, for
the deposit, in a bank or trust company, of money paid into court; for

upon real property ; and for the trausferring or disposing, from time to
time, of the money, or any investment, or security. But the money
must be deposited or loaned in the county where the fund belongs,
where that can be done conveniently and safely, and with advantage 
t,o the partiee interested.

§ 766. In case of a transfer of interest, or devolution of liability, the
action may be continued by or agaiwst the original party; unless the
court directs the person, to whom the interest is transferred, or upon 
whom the liability is devolved, to be substituted in the action, or 
joined with the original pa.rty, as the case requires.
§ 757. In case or the death of a sole plaintiif, or a sole defendant,1d

of two or more defendants, it the entire cause of action survives to or 
against the others, the action may proceed in favOl' of 01' ~ the
iiurvivors. Bot the estate of a person or party jointly liable upon eon· 
tract wit.h others shall not be discharged by his death, and the court
may make an order to bring in the proper representative of the decedent,
when it is necessary so to do for the proper disposition of the matter,
and, when the liability i8 several as well as joint, may order a sever- 
ance of the action so that it may proceed separately agains\ the repreeen .. 
tative of the decedent, and against the surviving defendant or defend-
ants. 
§ 759. In case of the death of one of two or more plaintiffs, or one
of two or more defendants, if part only of the cause of action, or part

case requires. Where an application is made by the plaintiff, to bring
in such a person as defendant, the court may direct that a supplemen­
tal summons issue, and that supplemental pleadings be made, Where 
an application is made by a. def endant, to bring in such a person, the
court may, and where the protection of the applicant's rights requires
it, must, permit the defendant to commence a cross action for that pur­ 
pose0 The cross action must be brou~ht in the same court, unless the
order otherwise specially directs. If 1t directs that the action be com­
menced in another court, the latter court may, by order, at any time
after the cross action is commenced, remove to itself the original action,
with like effect as if it had been brought therein. Unless the court
otherwise directs, the original action and the cross action must be
tried, and judgment rendered therein. as if they were one action. 
§ 761. At any time after the death of the plaintiff, or after the mar-
iage of the plaintiff, where it affects the rights of either party, the 
urt may, in its discretion, upon notice to such persons as it directs,
nd upon the application of the adverse party, or of a person whose 
interest is affected, direct that the action abate, unless it is continued
y the proper parties, within a time specified in the order, not less than
ix months, nor more than one year, after the granting thereof.

allow judgment to be taken, or after a verdict, report, or decision, or

unless the offer, verdict, report, or decision, or the interlocutory judg­
ment, is set aside. 
§ 764. After verdict, report, or decision, in an action to recover dam­
{ages for &"personal injury, the action does not abate by the death of 8. 
jparty, unless the verdict, report, or decision is finally set aside. Until 
iit is finally set aside, the subsequent proceedings, including an appeal
from an order setting it aside, or from a judgment or order reversing
or setting aside a judgment entered thereupon, a.re the same, as in a
~ase where the cause of action survives. 
§ 765. This title does not authorize the entry of a judgment against

mission to take .a copy, of a book, document, or other paper, in his pos­ 
session or under his control, relating. to the merits of the action, or of
the defence therein. 
§ 804. The general rules of practice must prescribe the cases, in
which a discovery or inspection may be so compelled, and the proceed-
ings for that purpose, where the same are not prescribed in this act. 
§ 805. To entitle a party to procure such a discovery or inspection,
he must present a petition, praying therefor, and verified by affidavit, 
to the court, or to a judge authorized to make an order in the action ;
upon which an order may be made, directing the party, against whom 
the discovery or inspection is sought, to allow it, or, in default thereof,
to show cause before the court, at a time and place, and upon a notice,
therein specified, why the prayer of the petition should not be
granted} and, if necessary or proper, that his proceedings be stayed
until the hearing of the application, although the stay exceeds twenty

Jnst to impose, permit the party in default to comply with the order
for a discovery and inspection; and, for that purpose, it may direct

of action, defences, counterclaims, or replies, interposed by him ; or

paper, be excluded from being given in evidence; or it may punish
the party for a contempt ; or both.

any portion thereof, or ta.king a copy thereof or extracts therefrom, or
otherwise. An order may be ma.de, as prescribed in this. section, by
a judge of the court, or, in a special proceeding pending out of court
before an officer, by the officer, or, in either case, by a referee duly
appointed in the cause, and authorized to hear testimony. A justice
of the peace, or other judge of a court not of record, may make such
an order in an action brought in his court, at any time after the com­
mencement thereof. 
§ 868. The production, upon a trial, of a book or paper, belonging to 
or under the control of a corporation, may be compel1ed, in like manner
as if it was in the hands, or under the control, of a natural person.

scribed in the last section, as the case requires, must be directed to the
president, or other head of the corporation, or to the officer thereof, in

objection to the competency or credibility of the witness; or to the
relevancy or substantial competency or a question put to him, or of an
answer given by him ; mar. be made, as if the witness was then
personally examined, and Without being noted upon the deposition.

fled copies thereof, are presumptive evidence of the facts therein con­
tained to show a compliance with the provisions of this article.

in the cause, may, in its or bis discretion, make an order, appointing
a referee to take the deposition of that person. The order must be
fonnded upon proof, by affidavit, that the applicant intends to make
the motion, or that notice of a motion has been ~ven, which the
applicant intends to oppose. The affidavit must specify the nature of

applicant in the prosecution or defence of the action, if a new trial is 
~anted.
4. Where the application is made before the joinder of issue, in an 
action brought in either of the courts, specified in the last subdivi­

competency or credibility of the witness, or to the relevancy, or sub­
stantial competency, of a question put to him, or of an answer given
by him, may be made, as if the witness was then personally examined,
and without being noted upon the deposition.

language, the order for the commission may, in the discretion of the

guage, and also in a foreign language ; that only the interrogatories
framed in the foreign language be put to the witnees ; and that hill
answers be taken, and the certificates be made out, in the same Ian- 
guage. Where such an order is made, it must provide for the payment,
by the applicant, to the adverse party, of a reasonable sum, fixed 
therein, for the expense of procuring the interrogatories, in his behalf,
to be translated. The judge, who settles the interrogatories, must settle
them in the foreign language, and in the En~lish Ianguage ; and, for
that purpose, he may call in the assistance of one or more experts,
whose compensation must be fixed by the judge, and paid by the appli-
cant. When the deposition is read in evidence, it, and the interroga-
tories, must be interpreted into the English language, as if the witness,
being unable to speak the English language, was personally present
and testifying.

eified in the last section, in its discretion, in a case where a commission

will be better promoted thereby, than by the issuing of a commission;
notwithstanding that a commission can be executed, in t.he country to 
which they are sent. Letters rogatory can be issued only to examine
one or more witnesses, upon written interrogatories, annexed thereto;
which must be framed and settled, and the depositions must be 
retumed, as prescribed in this article, with respect to the interroga-
tories annexed to a. commission, and the depositions taken thereunder.

§ 968. The issues, treated of in this chapter, are those only which
are presented by the pleadings. · An issue arises where a fact, or a con- 
clwdon of law, i8 maintained by one party, and controverted by the
other. Issues are of two kinds: 
1. Of law; and
2. Of fact.
§ 964. An issue of law arises only upon a demurrer. An issue of 
fact arises, in either of the following cases:
1. Upon a denial, contained in the answer, of a material allegation=~ 
of the complaint; or upon an allegation, contained in the answer, that
the defendant has not sufficient knowledge or information to form a
belief, with respect to a material alle~ation of the complaint. 
2. Upon a similar denial or allegation, contained in the reply, with
respect to a material allegation of the answer. 
3. Upon a material allegation of new matter, contained in the an­
swer, not requiring a reply; unless an issue of law is joined thereupon. 
4. Upon a material allegation of new matter, contained in the reply;
unlese an issue of law is joined thereupon. 
§ 965. An issue, either of law or of fact, must be tried as prescribed
in this chapter, unless it is disposed of as prescribed in chapter sixth 
of this act. 
§ 966. Where an issue of law and an issue of fact arise in one action,
the issue of law must be first disposed of, except as otherwise prescribed 
in the next section.
§ 967. A separate trial, between the plaintiff and one or more de- 
fendants, of some or all of the issues of fact, or one trial of some or all
of the issues of law, or a change in the order of disposition of the issues, 
may be directed by the court, in its discretion. Snch a direction may
be given, in an order, made upon notice; or except where an applica- 
tion for such an order has been denied, it may be given, by t.be judge
holding the term, where those issues are regnlarly upon the calendar
for trial, either with or without the entry of an order. 
§ 968. In each of the fo1lowing actions, an issue of fact must. be tried
by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or a reference is directed : 
1. An action in which the complaint demands judgment for a sum
of money only. · 
2. An action of ejectment ; for dower ; for waste ; for a nuisance ;
or to recover a chattel. 
§ 969. An issue of law, in any action, and an issue of fact, in an
action not specified in the last section, or wherein provision for a trial 
by a jury is not expressly made by law, must be tried by the court,
unless a reference or a jury trial is directed. 
§ 970. Where a party is entitled, by the Constitution, or by express
provision of law, to a trial, by a jnry, of one or more issues of fact, in 
an action not specified in section nine hundred and sixty.-eight of this
act, he may apply, upon notice, to the court for an order, directing all 
the questions, arising upon those issues, to be distinctly and plainly
stated for trial accordingly. Upon the hearing of the application, the
court must cause the issues, to the trial of which, by a jury, the party 
is entitled, 'to be distinctly and plainly stated. The subsequent pro­
ceedings are the same, as where questions, arising upon the issues, are
stated for trial by a jury, in a case where neither party can, as of right,
require such a trial; except that. the finding of the jury, upon each
question so stated, is conclusive in the action, unless the verdict is set
aside, or a new trial is granted. . 
§ 971. In an action, where a party is not entitled, as of right, to a
trial by a jury. the court may, in ite discretion, npon the application
of either party, or without application, direct that one or more questions
of fact, arising upon the issues, be tried by a jury, and may cause
those questions to be distinctly and plainly stated for trial accord­ 
ingly.
§ 972. If the questions, directed to be tried by a jury, as prescribed 
in the last two sections, do not embrace all the issues of fact in the
action, the remaining issues of fact must be tried by the court, or by a 
referee. 
§ 974. Where the defendant interposes a counterclaim, and there­
uron demands an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff, the mode 
o trial of an issue of fact, arising thereupon, is the same, as if it arose
in an action, brought by the defendant, against the plaintiff, for the
cause of action stated in the counterclaim, and demanding the same 
judgment.
§ 975. An issue, the disposition· of which is not necessary to enable 
the court to render the appropriate judgment, is not required to be 
tried. 
§ 976. An issue of law, or an issue of fact, triable by a jury or by
the court, must be tried at a term held by one jndge only, except as 
otherwise prescribed in section two hundred ninety-seven of this
act. In the supreme court, an issue of fact, triable by a jury, must be 
tried in the circuit court; and an issue of fact, triable by the court, 01' 
an issue of law, may be tried in the circuit court, or at a special term
of the supreme court, as prescribed in the general rules of practice. 
§ 977. At any time after the joinder of issue, and at leyt fourteen
jduA.before the commencement of the term, either party may serve a 
notice of trial. The party serving the notice must file with the clerk
a note of issue, stating the title of the action ; the names of the attor­
neys ; the time when the last pleading was served ; the nature of the
issue, whether of fact or of law ; and, if an issue of fact, whether it is
triable by a jury, or by the court, without a jury. The note of issue 
~ust be filed, at le11t twelvt 111,1 -_,fore the ·commencement of the
[term. The clerk must thereupon enter the cause upon the calendar, 
according to the date of the issue. The clerk must prepare the calen- 
dar and have· the necessary copies ready for distribution at least five
days before the commencement of the term. In the city e.nd county of 
New York, where a party has served a notice of trial, and filed a note
of issue, for a term, at which the cause is not-tried, it is not necessary
for him to serve a new notice of trial, or file a new note of issue for a
succeeding term ; and the action must remain on the calendar until it
is disposed of. 
§ 978. The issues on the calendar must be arranged by the clerk, in
the followrng order : · 
1. Issues of fact.
2. Issues of law. 
Where a jnry is in attendance, the issues must be disposed of iu the
same order ; unless, for the convenience of parties, or the dispatch of
business, the judge holding the term otherwise directs. 
§ 979. Where a.jury is not in attendance, issues of law have a pre-
ference over issues of fact ; unless the judge holding the term otherwise 
directs.
§ 980. Either party, who has served the notice, may bring the issue 
to trial; and, in the absence of the adverse party, unless the judge
holding the term, for good cause, otherwise directs, may proceed with 
the cause, and take a dismissal of the complaint, or a verdict, decision,
or judgment, as the case requires. (4U inquest, for want of an affida-
vit of merits, cannot be taken where the answer is verified/ 
§ 981. Where the issue is brought to trial by the pla.ii1titf, he must
furnish the court with copies of the summons and pleadings, and of 
the offer, if any has been made. Where the issue is brought to trial
by the defendant, and the plaintiff does not furnish those papers, they 
must be furnished by the defendant.

purpose, in the title of the complaint. 
§ 985. If the county, designated in the complaint, as the place of
trial, is not the proper county, the action may notwithstanding be tried

§ 992. An exception may be taken to the ruling of the court or of a
referee, upon a question of law, arising upon the trial of an issue of 
fact. Except a.s prescribed in section one thousand one hundred and
eighty of this act, au exception cannot be taken to a ruling, upon a
question of fact. For the purposes of this article, a trial by a jury is
regarded as continuing, until the verdict is rendered. 
§ 998. Upon the trial of an issue of fact by a referee, or by the court,
without a jury, a refusal to make any finding whatever, upon a ques­
tion of fac'; where a request to find thereupon is seasonably made by 
either party, or a finding without any evidence tending to sustain it,
is a ruling upon a question of law, within the meaning of the last section. 
§ 994. Where an issue of fact is tried by a referee, or by the court,
without a jury, an exception to a ruling, upon a question of law, made 
after the cause is finally submitted must be taken, by fl.ling a notice
of the exception in the clerk's office, and serving a copy thereof upon 
the attorney for the adverse party. The exception may be 80 taken, at
any time before the expiration of ten dqs after service, upon the 
attorney for the exceptant, of a copy of the decision of the- court; or
report of the referee, and a written notice of the entry of judgment
thereupon. If the notice of exception is tiled before the entry of final
judgment, it must be inserted in the judgment-roll ; if afterwards, it
must be annexed to the judgment-roll. In either case, it constitutes a
part of the papers, upon which an appeal from the judgment must be
heard. 
§ 995. In any other case, an exception must be taken, at the time
hen the ruling is made, unless it is taken to the charge given to the 
jury ; in which case, it must be taken before the jury have rendered
heir verdict. It must, at the time when it is taken, be reduced to 
"ting by the exeeptant, or entered in the minutes. 
§ 900. A ruling, to which an exception is taken, as prescribed in the
ast four sections, can be .reviewed only upon an appeal from the judg- 
ent, rendered after the trial ;/except in a case, where it is expreEif~
rescribed by law, that a motion-Yor a new trial may be madetbereu 
§ 997. Where a party intends to appeal from· a judgment, rendere
after the trial of an issue of fact, or to move for a new trial of such an
issue, he must, except w, otherwise prescribed by law, make a case, 
and procure the same to be settled and signed, by the judge or the
referee, by or before whom the action was tried, as prescribed in the
general rules of practice; or, in case of the death or disability of the
judge or referee, in such manner as the court directs. The case must
contain so much of the evidence, and other proceedings upon the trial, 
as is material to the questions to be raised thereby, and also the excep­
tions taken by the party making the case. If it afterwards becomes
necessary to separate the exceptions, the separation may be made, and
the exceptions may be stated, with 80 much of the evidence and other
proceedings, as is material to the questions raised by them, in a case,
prepared and settled, as directed in the general rules of practice; or,
in the absence of directions therein, by the court, upon motion. It is
not necessary to state, in a case, that a finding upon the facts, or a 
ruling upon the law, was made, where the finding or ruling appears in
a referee's report, or in the decision of the court, upon a trial by the
court, without a jury. 
§ 998. It is not neeeeeary to make· a ease, for the purpose of moving
or a new trial, upon the minutes of the judge, who presided at a trial 
11  f · l ·  
ya J'ury; or upon an a egation o nregu ar1ty, or surpnse; or where
f · d d 
party intends to appeal rom a JU gment entere upon a referee's
port, or a decision of the court upon a trial, without a jury, and to 
ely only upon exceptions, taken as prescribed in section nine hundred
nd ninety-four of this act. 
§ 999. The judge, presiding at a trial by a Jury, may, in his discre­
tion, entertain a motion, made upon his minutes, at the eame term, to 
184 
set aside the verdict· and grant a new trial, upon exeeptions ; or· because
the verdict is for excessive or insufficient damages; or otherwise con-
trary-to the evidence, or contrary to law. If an appeal is taken from 
the order, made upon the motion, it must be heard, upon a case, pre-
pared and settled in the usual manner. 
§ 1000. Upon the application of a party who has taken one or more
exceptions, the judge, presiding at a trial by a jury, may, in his dis- 
cretion, at any time during the same term, direct an order to be entered,
that the exceptions so taken be heard, in the first instance, at the gen-
eral term ; and that judgment upon the verdict be suspended, in the 
mean time. At any time before the hearing of the exceptions, the
order may be revoked or modified, upon notice, in court or out of·
court, by the judge who ma.de it; or it m~be set aside for irregu- 
larity, by the court, at any term thereof. nless it is so revoked or
set aside, the exceptions must be heard upo a motion for a new trial,
which must be decided by the general temt;:) The motion is deemed 
to have been made, when the order was granted; and either party
may notice it for hearing at the general term, upon the exceptions. 
§ 1001. Where the decision or report, rendered upon the trial of an
issue of fact by the court, without a jury, or by a referee, directs an 
interlocutory judgment to be entered; and further proceedings must
be taken, before the court, or a judge thereof, or a referee, before a
final judgment can be entered; a motion for a new trial, upon one or
more exceptions, may be made· at the general term, after the entry
of the interlocutory judgment, and before the commencement of the
hearing directed therein. The time within which the party must
except, for that purpose, to a ruling of law, made, upon such a trial,
by the judge or the referee, after the close of the testimony, is te.Jl da~e
after service of a copy of the decision or report, and notice 1>T" l e
entry of the interlocutory judgment thereupon. 
§ 1002. In a case, not specified in the last three sections, a motion fo~
a new trial must, in the first instance, be heard and decided at th~
special term. But where it is founded upon an allegation of error, tij 
a finding of fact, or ruling upon the law, made by the judge upon th
trial, it cannot be heard at a special term, held by another judge; unles ·
the judge, who presided at the trial, is dead, or his term of office b 
expired, or he specially directs the motion to be beard before anothe
judge. And a trial by a referee cannot be reviewed, by a motion for
new trial, founded upon such an allegation, except in a case specified.
in the last section. 
§ 1003. The provisions of this article, relating to the proceedings to 
review a trial by a jury, are applicable to the trial, by a jury, of one or
more specific questions of fact, arising upon the issues, in an action 
triable by the court. But, except in a case specified in section nine
hundred seventy of this act, a new trial may be granted, as to 
some of the questions so tried, and refused as to the others ; and an
error, in the admission or exclusion of evidence, or in any other ruling
or direction of the judge, upon the trial, may, in the discretion of the
court which reviews it, be disregarded ; if that court is of opinion, that
substantial justice does not require that a new trial should be granted.
Where the judge, who presided at the trial, neither entertains a motionl
for a new trial, nor directs exceptions, taken at the: trial, to .be heard at
the general term, a motion for a new trial can be made only at the term,
where the motion for final judgment is made, or the remaining issues
of fact are tried, as the case requires. · · · . ' 
§ 1004. In an action triable by the court, where a reference bas been
made, to report upon one or more specific questions of fact, involved in
the issue, a motion for a new hearing may be made at a special term, 
at any time before the bearing of a motion for final judgment, or the
trial of the remaining isauee of fact. The motion must be made upon
affidavits, unless the court, or a judge thereof, directs a case to be pre-
pared and settled. - 
§ 1005. The entry of final judgment, and the subsequent proceedings
to collect or otherwise enf oree it, are not stayed by an exception, the
preparation or settlemen~ of a ease, or a motion for a new trial, unless 
an order for such a stay 18 procured and served; and the entry, collee­
tion, or other enforcement of a judgment does not prejudice a subsequent
motion for a new trial. Where a new trial is granted, the court may 
direct and enforce restitution, as where a judgment is reversed upon
ap;\>ea.1. 
§ 1006. The taking of an exception, upon a trial by a jury, or the
statement thereof in a case, as prescribed in this article, does not preju­ 
dice a. motion for a. new trial, on the ground that the verdict waa
contrary to evidence ; but such a motion may be made, before or after
the hearing of the exception ; or, in the discretion of the court before
which the exception is heard, at the time of the hearing. 
§ 1007. The notes of an official stenographer or assistant-steno1r­
rapher, taken at a trial, when written out at length, may be treated, m
the discretion of the judge, as the minutes of the judge upon the trial,
for the purposes of this article.

W1 ou a Jury; n ess a re,erence 1s rec , m a case prescn e y
law. But such an action, other than to recover dama~es for breach of 
a contract, cannot be tried by the court, without a Jury, unlees the
judge, presiding at the term ,vhere it is brought on for trial, assents to 
such a trial. His refusal so to assent annuls a waiver, made as pre-
scribed in subdivision second, third, or fourth of the next section. 
§ 1009. A party may waive his right to the trial of the issue of fact,
by a jury, in any of the following modes: 
1. By failing to appear at the trial.
2. By filing with the clerk a. written waiver, signed by the attomey 
for the party.
8. By an oral consent in open court, entered in the minutes.
4. By moving the trial of the action, without a jury; or, if the ad­ 
verse party so moves it, by failing to claim a trial by a jury, before the
production of any evidence upon the trial. 
§ 1010. Upon a trial, by the court, of an issue or fact or of law, its
decision, in writing, must be tiled, in the clerk's office, within twenty
days after the final adjournment of the term, where the issue was tried.
If it is not so filed, either party may move, at a special term, for a new
trial upon that gronnd. If the decision has not been filed, when the~~!:'~ 
motion is heard, the court must make an order for a new trial, either
absolutely, or unless it is tiled, within a time specified in the order. If 
an order for a new trial is made, or a contingent order for a new trial
becomes absolute, the costs of the former trial abide the event. 
§ 1011. Except in a case specified in the next section, the whole
issue, or any of the issues in an action, either of fact or of law, must 
be referred, upon the consent of the parties, manifested by a written
stipulation, signed by their attorneys, and filed with the clerk. Where
the stipulation does not name the referee, he may be designated by the
court, on motion of either party. Where the stipulation names the
referee, the clerk must enter an order, of course, referring the issue or 
issueS'fortrial, to that person only. IC the referee named in a. stipula-
tion refuses to serve, or if a. new trial of an action tried by a referee so
named is granted, the court must appoint another referee, unless the
stipulation expressly provides otherwise. 
§ 1012. But a reference shall not be made, of course, upon the con-
sent of the parties, in an action to annul the marriage, or for a divorce 
or a separation ; or an action against a corporation, to obtain a dlssolu-
tiou thereof, the appointment of a receiver of its property, or the dis­
tribution of its property, unless it is brought by the Attomey-General;
or an action wherein a defendant, to be affected by the result of the
trial, is an infant. In a case specified in this section, where the parties
consent to a reference, the court may, in its discretion, grant or refuse
a reference ; and, where a reference is granted, the court must desig-
nate the referee. 
§ 1013. The court may, of its own motion, or upon the application of
either party, without the consent of the other, direct a trial of the
issues of fact, by a referee, where the trial will require the examina-
tion of a long account, on either side, and will not require the decision
of difficult questions of law. In an action, triable by the court, with-~:
out a jury, a reference may be mnde, as prescribed in this section, to 
decide the whole issue, or any of the issues; or to report the referee's
finding, upon ode or more specific questions of fa.ct, involved in the 
issue.
§ 1014. Where a reference is made, as prescribed in the last section, 
to report upon a specific question of fact, involved in the issue, and the
~ ,.4-"l'mination of one or more other issues 18 necessary, in order to 
enable the C'>art to render judgment, they must be tried, either before
or after the filing of the report, as the court directs, and either by a 
jury, or by the court, without a jury, as the case requires. \Vhere
they are tried by a jury, application for judgment must be made upon
the verdict and the report. 
§ 1015. The court may likewise, of its own mot.ion, or upon the
application of··either party, without the conseut of the other, -direct a
reference to take an account, and report to the court thereon, either 
with or without the testimony, after interlocutory or final judgment, or
where it is necessary to do so, for the information of the court; aud
also to determine and report upon a question of fact, arising in any
stage of the action, upon a motion, or otherwise, except upon the 
pleadings. ·
§ 1016. A referee, appointed as prescribed in either of the foregoing sections of this title, must, before proceeding to hear the testimony, be
sworn faithfully and fairly to try the issues, or to determine the ques­
tions referred to him, as the case requires, and to make a just and true
report, according to the best of his understanding. The oath may be
administered by an officer specified in section eight·hundred and forty­ 
two of this act. But where all the J'arties, whose interests will be
affected by the result, are of age, an present, in person or by attor­ 
ney, they may expressly waive the referee's oath. The waiver may be
made by written stipulation, or orally. If it is oral, it must be entered 
in the referee's minutes. 
§ 1017. A witness may be eubpcenaed to attend before a. referee,
appointed as prescribed in either of the foregoin~ sections of this title,
to testify, and, in a proper case, to bring with him a book, document, 
or other paper, as upon a trial by the court. 
§ 1018. The trial, by a referee, of an issue of fact, or of an issue of
law, must be brought on upon like notice, and conducted in like man­ 
ner, and the papers to be furnished thereupon are the same, and are
furnished in like manner, as where the trial is by the court, without a.
jury. The referee exercises, upon such a trial, the same power as the
court, to grant adjournments, to preserve order, and punish the viola­
tion thereof. Upon the trial of an issue of fact, the referee exercises
also the same power as the court, to allow amendments to the summons,
or to the pleadings; to compel the attendance of a witness by attach­
ment; and to punish a witness for a contempt of court, for nou-atteud-.
ance, or refusal to be sworn, or to testify. Upon the trial of an issue
of law, the referee exercises the same power as the court, to permit a
party in fault to plead anew or amend; to direct the action to be
divided into two or more actions; to award costs, and otherwise to dis­
pose of any question, arising upon the decision of the issue referred to 
him. The powers, conferred by this section, are exercised in like man­
ner, and upon like terms, as similar powers are exercised by the court,
upon a trial. 
§ 1019. Upon the trial, by a referee, of an issue of fact, or an issue
of law, his written report must be either filed with the clerk, or deliv­
ered to the attorney for one of the parties, within sixty days from the
time when the cause is finally submitted; otherwise either party may,
before it is filed or delivered, serve a notice, upon the attorney for the
ad verse party, that be elects to end the ref ere nee. In such a. case, the
action must thenceforth proceed, as if the reference had not been
directed ; and the referee is not entitled to any fees. 
§ 1020. Where the double, treble, or other increased damages are 
given by statute, the decision of the court, or the report of the referee,
must specify the sum awarded as single damages, and direct judgment 
for the increased damages.
§ 1021. The decision of the court, or the report of a referee, npon 
the trial of a demurrer, must direct the final or interlocutory jndg- 
~ent to be ~ntered thereupon. .Where it directs an interlocutory
judgment, with leave to the pnrt.y m fault to plead anew or ameud, or 
permitting the act.ion to. be divided into two or more actions, and no
other.Issue remains to be disposed of, it may also direct the final jndg-
ment to be entered if the party in fault fails to comply with any of the
directions given or terms imposed. 
§ 1022. The decision of the court, or the report of the referee, upon
the trial of the whole issue of fact, must state separately the facts 
f'ound, and the couclueions of law; audit must direct the judgment,
to be entered thereupon. In an action, where the costs are in the dis-
cretion of the court, the decision or report must award or deny costs;
and, if it awards costs, it must designate the party to whom costs, to 
be taxed, are a warded.
§ 1023. Before the cause is finally submitted to the court or the 
referee, or within such time afterwards, and before the decision or
report is rendered, as the conrt 01' referee allows, the attorney for either 
party may submit, in writing, a statement of the facts, which he deems
established by the evidence, and of the rullngs npon questions of law, 
which he desires the court or the referee to make. The statement must
be· in the form of distinct. propositions of law, or of fact, or both, sepa- 
rately stated; each of which must be numbered, and so prepared,
with respect to its length, and the subject and phraseology thereof, that 
the court or referee may conveniently pass upon it. At or before the
time, when the decision or report is rendered, the court or the referee
must note, in the margin of the statement, the manner in which each
proposition has been disposed of, and must either file, or return to the
attorney, the statement thus noted; but an omission so to do does not
affect the validity of the decision or report. 
§ 1024. A referee, appointed by the court, must be free from all just
objections; and no person shall be so appointed, to whom all the parties 
object, except in an action to annul a marriage, or for a divorce, or a
separation. A judge cannot be appointed a referee, in an action
brought in the court, of wh ch be is a judge, except by the written con-
sent of the parties; and, in that case, be cannot receive any compen-
sation as referee. 
§ 1025. Where the court is authorized to appoint a referee, it may,
in its discretion, appoint either one or three. And where a reference 
is made by consent of the parties, they may select any number of
referees, not exceeding five. 
§ 1026. Where the reference is to more than one referee, all must
meet together, and hear all the allegations and proofs of the parties;
but a majority may appohrt a time and place for the trial, decide any 
ti hi h . th t  ) . t I 
ques ion w ic arises upon e riai, sign a repor, or sett e a case.
.Either· of them may administer an oath to a witness; and a majority 
of those present, at a time and place appointed fur the trial, may
adjourn the trial to a future day.

§ 1068. Where it appears to the· court, that a fair and impartial trial
of an issue of fact,. triable by a jury, joined in an action, pending in
the supreme court, or in a superior city court, cannot be had without a
struck jnry, or that the importance or int.ricacy of the case requires such
a jury, the court must make an order, upon notice, directing a special
jury to be struck, for the trial of the issue. The order must specify
the term, and it may specify a particular day in the term, when the
jurors must attend. 
§ 1064. Unless the order specifies, or directs the officer, who is to 
strike the jury, to fix, a time for the parties to attend, the party ob-
taining it must give at least, eight days' notice of the time, when he

therefrom one name; and 80 alternately, until each party has stricken 
out twelve names.

or a talesman, upon the objection of either party, without a. formal 
challenge. 
§ 1008. If it appears to the court, to which an application for a spe­ 
cial jury is made, that the clerk, or the commissioner of jurors, as the
case may be, is interested in the action ; or is related to either of the
parties; or is not indifferent, between them; the court must appoint
two disinterested persons to strike the jury. The persons so appointed 
possess, for the purposes of the action, all the powers conferred, by this article, upon the clerk, or the commissioner of jurors.

day tba.t he so ne~lects to attend. 
§ 1073. Where 1t appears, by the return of the sheriff, that the delin-
quent W88 personally notified to attend, the fine may be imposed by 
the court, at the term which he was required to attend. But where it
appears, by the return, that he was notified, by leaving the notice at 
his residence, the court must cause an order to be entered in its min-
utes, requiring him to show cause, on the first day of the next term of 
the court, why a fine should not be imposed upon him.

the order to the sheriff of the county, who must serve one copy on the
delinquent personally, and return the other, with his proceedings

served, or if the delinquent attends, in obedience thereto, the court 
must, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, impose the proper
fine ; otherwise it must make a further order, requiring the delinquent
to show cause at the next term, why the fine should not be imposed.
The proceedings under such an order a.re the same as under the first
order. Similar orders must be made, from term to term, and similar
proceedings taken, until the delinquent is persone.lly served, or attends
in obedience thereto. 
§ 1077. But if it appears, from the return of the sheriff, or from any
other evidence, that the juror is dead, or insane, or has permanently
removed from the county; or if a satisfactory excuse is rendered by
any person, in his behalf, for his default, the court may, in its discre-
tion, discontinue the proceedings. 
§ 1078. This article does not apply to the city and county of New-
York, or to the county of Kings.

§ 1084. The jury year, in the city and county of New-York, com-
mences on the first day of October. A person who has actually served, 
u a trial juror, in a court of record of the State, within that city and

the court ; except that be shall not be discharged, until the close of a
trial, in which be is serving, when the twelve days expire. A person
diacbarged, as prescribed in this section, is, thereafter, during the same
jury year, exempt from jury service in any county of the State. Where
the certificates of oue or more clerks of the courts, made as prescribed
in section ten hundred and eighty-nine of this act, show that a person
is entitled to a discharge, as prescribed in this section, the commissioner
of jurors must, upon request, certify to the fact. A person cannot serve 
as a. trial juror, in courts of record, at more than two terms in a jury year. 
§ 1085. The judge, holding a term, may, in bis discretion, excuse a
mal juror from service at that term, for not more than three days at a 
time, where the exigencies of bis business require his temporary exemp-
tion. The judge may also discharge, for the term, one or more jurors,
notified and attending, whose further attendance is not required for the
trial of issues at that term. Or he may discharge, until a day certain,
one or more jurors, notified and attending, whose attendance will not
be required, for the trial of issues, until that day. Each juror, so dis-
charged until a day certain, must attend at the opening of the court on
that day, and thereafter until he is discharged, without further notice.
If he fails so to do, he is liable to the same punishment, and the same
proceedings must be taken, as if be bad failed to attend, at the time
fixed in the notice given to him. 
§ 1086. Except as prescribed in the last section, a court or a judge
shall not excuse a person, liable to serve as a trial juror: and duly drawn 
and notified, unless it is shown, by the oath of the juror, or, if he is
unable to attend, by the oath of another person, acquainted with the 
f~, that he is then necessarily absent from the city, and will not
retllm in time to serve; or that the interests of the public, or of the
juror, will be materially Injured by bis attendance; or that he is physic-
ally unable to serve ; or that his wife, or a near relative of himself or
his wife, bas recently died or is dangerously sick. Where a person
liable to serve is excused, in a case specified in this section, or where a
person, uotitied to attend a term, as a trial juror, is entitled to, and 
claims an exemption, he can be excused only by the judge, holding the
term, which he has been notified to attend. Such an excuse does noi
extend beyond that term. 
§ 1087. A person, who has been notified to attend, as a trial juror,
and who applies to be excused, as prescribed in the last section, must 
bring the notice, if he has received it, into court, and present it, in
open court to the judge; or, if he cannot personally attend, he must
send it, by a person capable of making the necessary proof, in relation 
to his claim to be excused. A note of the excuse, and of the reason
therefor, attested by the judge, who must append bis signature or his 
initials thereto, must also be made upon the notice to attend; or, if
the juror bas not brought it into court, upon a separate piece of paper;
which must be transmitted to the commissioner of jurors, by the clerk;
as part of the return, made as prescribed in section ten hundred and
eighty-nine of this act. 
§ 1088. A person, serving as a trial juror, elsewhere than in a court
of record, is excused from jury duty in a court of record, only during 
the time of his actual service elsewhere.
§ 1089. The clerk of each court of record in the city and county of 
New-York, must, within ten days after the close of each term, for
which trial jurors have been drawn, or after the discharge of the trial 
jurors, if they are discharged before the close of the term, retum to
the commissioner of jurors, the certified copy of the minute of the 
drawing of the jurors, received from the sheriff, and the sheriff's re­ 
tum thereto, or a copy of each paper, certified by the clerk; together
with each notice or other paper, attested by a judge, as prescribed in
the last section but one. The clerk must also deliver to the commis­
sioner therewith, his certificate, specifying, distinctly and in detail, as 
follows: .
1. The name and residence of each juror, who attended and served; 
the number of days the juror attended for the purpose of serving; and
the number of days he actually served. 
2. The name and residence of each juror, who was excused or dis­
charged; with the reason therefor. 
3. The name and residence of each 'person aosifled, who did not at­ 
tend or serve.
4. The name and residence or each person fined, and the date and 
amount of his fine, unless the fine bas been remitted, as prescribed in section eleven hundred and nine of this act. 
The return and certificate must be filed in the commissioner's office,
and shall not be altered or corrected, except in pursuance of an order
of the court. If a clerk fails to make a complete return and certificate,
as prescribed in this section, he is guilty of a contempt of the court ;
and the commissioner of jurors must institute the appropriate proceed­
ings to punish him accordingly. 
§ 1090. Trial jurors must be selected by the commissioner of jurors,
who must alone decide upon their qualifications, and exemptions, ex­
cept as otherwise expressly prescribed in this article. But this section 
does not impair the right to challenge a particular juror at the trial.
The commissioner may issue, to a person entitled to an exemption, a 
certificate of that fact, which exempts the person, to whom it is granted,
from jury duty, during the time limited therein. He must keep a
record of all proceedings before him, or in bis office. He is entitled to,
and must collect, for the benefit of the city, for a copy of a paper fur­
nished by him, the same fees as the clerk of a court of record. 
§ 1091. The commissioner of jurors may, from time to time appoint,
and at pleasure remove, one or more assistants, clerks in his office, and 
messengers, and may fix their compensation. He may designate, in 
204 
writing, an assistant, to attend, in his place, the drawing of jurors, for
a particular term. The commissioner, or each assistaut, whom he des- 
ignates for the purpose, by a certificate, filed in the office of the county
clerk, may administer an oath or affirmation, in relation to any matter, 
embraced within the provisions of this article. 
§ 1092. The president and commissioners of the department of taxes
and assessments, the police commissioners, and all other pnblic officers 
in the city of New-York, must render to the commissioner of jurors, all
the assistance in their power, to enable him to procure the names of per-
sons, liable to serve as trial jurors. 
§ 1093. The board of aldermau+of'the city of New-York mnst take
care, that suitable rooms, and other accommodations are provided for 
the use of the commissioner of jurors. If, by the first day of March,
in auy year, suitable rooms have not been provided for his use, for the 
year commencing on the first day of May next ensuing, he may lease
suitable rooms, for that year, and may pay the reut, out of the money
received by him for fines and penalties. But. a lease so made shall not
take effect, until a majority of the members of the board, specified in section eleven hundred and fourteen of this act, indorse therenpon a
certificate, signed by them, to the effect, that, in their opinion, such a 
lease is necessary, in consequence of the omission to make other suita-
ble provision, as prescribed in this. section ; that the rooms leased are
required, for the proper performance of the duties of the commissioner;
that the rent payable therefor, by the terms of the lease, is, in their
opiniou, reasonable; and that the lease is, in all other respects, fair­
just, and proper. The proper and necessary expenses of the commis,
sioner'a office, including the reasonable compensation of his assistanta,
clerks, and meeaengers, necessary printing and advertising, books, sta­
tionery, and other articles required for the convenient discharze of his
duties, may be paid by him, out of the money, received by him for
fines and penalties. If there is a deficiency, the board of alderman's 
mnst provide for the payment thereof, by the comptroller of the city of
New-York, out of the city treasury. 
§ 1094. The commissioner must. commence the preparation of lists
of trial jurors, in the month of May, in each year. For that purpose, 
the names of the persons, liable to serve as trial jurors, must. be
entered in suitable books, alphabetically, with the occnpat.ion, place of:
business, and residence of each, ae far as those particulars can be con- 
veniently ascertained. After the first day of June, he must publish a
notice, for at least ten days, in not less than six of the newspapers
published in the city, that. claims for exempt.ion will be heard by him.
He may insert in, or append to the notice, copies of such portions of
the etatutes, relating to jurors, as he deems expedient. He must hear
.and determiue all claims for exemption, and must keep a record of the 
persons exempted, and of the period of time for which the exemption
of each is al lowed. 
§ 1095. The commissioner may cause to be personally served, on any 
person, within the city, a notice, requiring him to attend, at the com-
missioner's office, at a specified time, not less than twenty-four hours 
af

ter service o e no ice, ror . e purpose o es 1 ymg concernmg is 
own liability, or t.he liability of any other person, to serve as a juror.
A person so notified must attend, and test.ify accordingly. If he fails 
t.o attend, as specified in the notice, for any cause, except physical
inability; or if he refuses to be sworn, or to answer any legal and per-
tinent question, put to him by t.he commissioner; he forfeits fifty dol- 
Jars for each failure or refusal. One or more successive notices may be
served upon the same person, where he fails to attend, as reqnired by 
a former notice; and he is liable to the same penalty, for each failure
so to attend. But the commissioner may, in his discretion, dispense
with the personal attendance of a person so notified, where another
person, cognizant of the facts, is produced and testifies in his stead :
and where a person bas so attended twice, he cannot be required ~
attend again, in the same jury year. 
§ 1096. On or before the first day of October, in each year, the com­
missioner must return to the clerk of the city and county of New York, 
to be filed in his office, certified copies of the lists, prepared by him, of
the persons, liable to serve as trial jurors in the courts of record, for 
the ensuing jury year. He may, from time to time thereafter, strike
from the lists kept by him, the name of a person, who is found by him
to be exempt or disqualified. In that case, he must record the reason
w1!, the name is stricken off'. 
§ 1097. When the certified copies of the lists have been returned, as
prescribed in the last section, the ballots for trial jurors, used in the 
previous year, must be returned, by the count.y clerk, to the commie­
sioner, who must destroy those which are not required for the current 
jury year. The ballots for the current jnry year must be prepared l>y 
the commissioner, who may use, for that purpose, 80 many of the bal­
lots, prepared for the previous year, as he deems expedient. The bal-
lots, so prepared, must be delivered by the commissioner to the county
clerk, and deposited by the county clerk, or his deputy, in & box, as
prescribed in article second of title third of this chapter. The commis­
sioner may, from time to time thereafter, return certified copies of
additional lists, containing the names of persons, liable to serve as trial
jurors, which were omitted from the former lists; and ballots, contain­
ing those names, must be prepared in like manner, and used for the
residue of the jnry year. 
§ 1098. The number of trial jurors, to be drawn for each term, and
each separate part of a term, of a. court of record in the city, at which
issues of fact are triable by jury, must be fixed by a general order of 
the court, or, if it is not so fixed for a term, or a separate pa.rt of & 
term, by a writt.en order of the judge, appointed to hold the same.
The order, or a certified copy thereof, must be tiled in the office of the
county clerk. If the number has not been fixed, in either mode, at
the time of the drawing, one hundred trial jurors must be drawn for
each term, or for each part, if the term consists of two or more separate
parts. 
§ 1099. On a day, designated by the county clerk, not less than
fonrteen, nor more than twenty days, before the day appointed for
holding, in the city, a term of a court of record, at which Issues of
fact are triable by jury, the commissi mer of jurors, in person, or by an 
assistant designated by him; the sheriff' of the city and county of
New-York, in person, or by his under-sheriff; and one or more judges
of courts of record, residing in the city, must attend, at the, office of
the county clerk, to witness and assist m the drawing of trial jurors
for the term.

served, upon the absent commissioner or sheriff, and upon at least three
judges of one or more courts of record, residing in the city, written

1. The county clerk, or bis deputy, must shake the box containing 
the ballots, so as thoroughly to mix them.
2. He must then, without seeing the name contained in any ballot,

minute, or for making a return thereupon. A clerk of a court, who 
omits to notify the clerk of the board of alderman, as prescribed in this section, is liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars, for each omission, 
to be recovered by any person suing therefor.
§ 1108. At any time, during the sitting of a term of a court of record

fifty dollars. A fine thus imposed may be wholly or partly remitted,

term, and upon good cause shown ; otherwise it shall not be remitted,
except as prescribed in sections eleven hundred and thirteen and
eleven hundred and fourteen of this act. Each remission, 80 made by
the judge, with the reason therefor, must be entered in the minutes of
the court. This section applies to a special juror, as well 8.8 to an ordi­ 
nary trial juror. 
§ 1110. Where a person, duly drawn and notified, fails to attend

before the court; and, when be has been so brought, it may, in its dis­
cretion, compel him to serve. 
§ 1111. A list of trial jurors, for each of the district courts, must be
selected by the commissioner of jurors ; and must consist of not le88 
than fifty, nor more than one hundred jurors. A person shall not be

the court is held. The judge of each district court must impose a fine
of twenty-five dollars, upon each person, duly drawn, and notified to 
attend the court, as a trial juror, who fails to attend, as required by the
notice. The clerk of the court must, within ten days thereafter, trans- 
mit to the commissioner of jurors a certificate, showing that the fine
has been so imposed, and stating how the notice to attend was served
upon the delinquent, in order that the same proceedings may be had,
as in the case of a delinquent juror in a court of record. A judge, or a

§ 1112. The board for the selection of grand jnrots must, at the time
when it selects the . grand jurors for each jury year, also select, from 
the lists of trial jurors for that year, the names of not less than one hun-
dred and twenty, nor more than one hundred and fifty persons, to con­
stitute the sheriff 'a jurors, for that jury year. The commissioner of
jurors must forthwith transmit, to the sheriff of the city and county of
New-York, a list, certified by him, containing the names of the persons
so selected, with the proper additions of each, and showing that they
have been selected, as prescribed in this section. The sheriff must cauee
ballots to be pre_pared, as prescribed in article second of title third of 
this chapter, and to be deposited in a. proper box. Where the sberift" is 
authorized or required by law, to empanel a jury for any purpose, the
requisite number of ballots must. be drawn from t.he box, as prescribed 
in that article, by the sheriff, or hy his under-sheriff, or deputy-sheriff.
But the sheriff may, in his discretion, divide the names contained in
the list, into three panels, each containing an equal number of names,
as nearly as may be. In that case, he must designate the mouths, in
which each panel wil1 be used, sot.hat the jury duty shall be distributed
equally, as nearly as may be, among the jurors; and ballots shall be
deposited in the box, at the beginning of each month, containing the
names of the jurors designated for that mont.h. 
§ 1113. The commissioner of jurors must cause a notice to be served
upon each delinquent trial juror, returned as having been fined, stating
the amount of the fine, and the term at which be was fined, and requir-
ing him to attend before the commissioner at the latter's office, on a
specified day and at a specified hour, and show cause, if he has any, 
why the fine should be wholly or partly remitted, or why payment
of the fine should not be enforced. The notice must be served at least
six days before the day therein specified. If the sheriffs return shows
that notice to attend, as .., trial juror, was personally served upon the
person fined, the notice to show cause, as prescribed in this section, may
be served upon him either personally, or by leaving it at bis residence,
or usual place of business, with a person of suitable age and discretion;
otherwise it must be served upon him personally. If a person so noti-
fied fails to attend, the fine must be enforced. If he attends, he may
demand a bearing before the board for the enforcement of jury fines;
otherwise the commissioner must decide with respect to the remission
of the whole or any part of the fine, and the sufficiency of the cause
shown, if any, and his decision is conclusive, wit.h respect to that fine,
unless the person fiued, within ten days thereafter, serves upon him a
written demand of a bearing before the board or enforcement. In
that case, the commissioner must appoint a time for the hearing; and
the person fined must then attend without further notice. 
§ 1114. The presiding justice of the supreme court, in the first judicial
department, the chief-judge of the court of common pleas, the chief- 
judge of the superior court, the chief-justice of the marine court, the
mayor, the recorder, the city judge, the judge of the court of general
sessions, and the commissioner of jurors, constitute the board for the 
enforcement of jury fines. The board must meet, at the office of the
commissioner of jurors, on the last .Monday in October in each year,
and on the last Monday of each month thereafter, until and including
the following month of June ; and as much oftener, as the business
before it.requires, Three members of the board constitute a quorum.
The board, either upon a hearing, or when acting upon the commis-
sioner's decision, as the case requires, has exclusive power, except as
in this article otherwise prescribed, to remit the whole or any part of a.
tine. The board, or the commissioner, may, in its or his discretion,
bear testimony, or determine a case upon affidavits; and may, from
time to time, adjourn the hearing or final disposition of a particular case. 
§ 1115. The board may compel the attendance of any person, reqnired
to appear before it, as prescribed in the 18.Bt section but one. It may
issue a warrant, directed to the sheriff of t.he city and conut.y of New-
York, comruaudiug him to arrest, and bring before the board, a person,
who fails to attend, at the time appointed for heariug his cruse, or to
pay a fine imposed upon him, aud not remitted by the board. If a. 
delinquent trial jnror, duly drawn, and returned by the sheriff as per-
eonallf notified to attend a term, or personally notified to attend before 
the commissioner, as prescribed in the laet section but one, is, in the
opinion of the board, able to pay his fine, the board may make an order, 
directing the sheriff" to arrest him, and imprison him in the county jail,
until the fine is paid, not exceeding thirty days. The sheriff must
obey such an order. The board may make an order, directing that a
person, paying a fine imposed upon him, be excused from jury duty,
for a period not exceeding one year. 
§ 1116. Aft.er ten days have expired, since the final decision of the
board of enforcement, with respect to a fine, as prescribed in the last section but. one, if the fine has not been remitted or paid, the commis­
sioner must issue a warrant, under hie hand, directed to the sheriff of
the city and county of New-York, reciting the facts, and commanding
the sheriff to collect from each person, named in the schedule annexed 
thereto, the sum, set opposite that person's name in the schedule, and
to pay over the same to the commissioner. The schedule must contain
the names of persons, fined and notified to show cause, whose fines have
not been wholly paid or remitted; it must show the amount of each
fine, remaining unremitted or unpaid; and the residence or usual place
of business of each person fined, as far as it can be conveniently ascer­
tained. The sheriff" must collect each fine, by a levy upon and sale of
the personal property of the person fined, as prescribed by law, where
an execution against property is issued upon a judgment, rendered iu
a court of record. The sheriff is entitled, in each case, to the same fees
as upon such au execution, to be collected in the same manner. He 
must return the warrant and schedule, with his proceedings thereupon, 
to the commissioner, within thirty days after the delivery thereof to
him ; and must then pay over the money collected, less his fees.
His return may be compelled by the supreme court, in the same man­
ner as the return of an execution against, property, issued upon a judg­
ment rendered iu that court, For his failure to collect a fine, an action
may be maintained against him, in a case where such a caee* may be
maintained by a judgment creditor, ap:ainst a. sheriff failing to collect
an execution against property, and with like effect. The provisions of section one thousand one hundred and nineteen of this act apply to 
such an action.
§ 1117. The commissioners* must, within thirty days after the 
return of the warrant to him, file with the clerk of the court, by which
each uncollected fine was imposed, a certificate, to the effect that the 
warrant has been returned, and showing what fines remain uncollected.
Thereupon the clerk must, make, in the docket-book of judgments,
kept by him, the same entries, as nearly as may be, with respect to
each uncollected fine, as if it was a final judgment, rendered in an
action. If the fine was imposed by a. court, other than the supreme
court, the clerk thereof must immediately transmit a. transcript of the
entries, to the clerk of the city and county of New-York, who must file
it. and make the appropriate entries, in his docket-book of judgments,
The commissioner must pay the clerk's fees, at the rate allowed for
similar services, with respect to judgments. When the entries have
been ma.de, the fine, with interest, becomes a lien upon the real prop­ 
erty of the person fiued, aa if it was recovered by a. judgment in the
same court ; and an execution to collect it may be issued, directed. to
the sheriff of the city and county of New-York, as upon such a judg­
ment. The commissioner has, in relation to the execution, and the 
satisfaction of the fine, a11 the powers of the attomey for a pa.rty recover-
ing such a judgment, in relation to the judgment, and the execution
issued thereupon. 
§ 1118. The commissioner of jurors must receive all money, paid or
eollected for fines or penalties, as prescribed in this article; and he may 
make all payments therefrom, which he is authorized by this article to
make. He must give a receipt for any money paid to him, for a fine
or penalty. He must keep a just and faithful account of all receipts 
and payments, by items, showiug the name of the person, from whom
each sum of money was received, and to whom each sum of money was
paid ; and must, at all reasonable times, keep hie account open to pub-
lic inspection. At the end of each calendar year, his account must be
verified by hie affidavit, to the effect, that it is, in all respects, just and
true; and that he has not received any sum of money, during the
year, for which he has not charged himself in the account. The
account, thus verified, must be audited and,certified, by at least three
other members of the board for the enforcement of jury fines; and the
commissioner must thereupon pay over, to the chamberlain of the city,
the balance, if any, in his hands. The account, thus audited and cer-
tified, must immediately be transmitted by the commissioner, to the
clerk of the board of aldermen; and must be published in the news-
paper, designated, as prescribed by law, for the publication of the
official proceedings of city officers. . 
§ 1119. The corporation attorney of the city of New-York must,
when required by the commissioner of jurors, prosecute, in the proper 
court, an action for the collection of each penalty, incurred as pre-
scribed in this article ; unless he if'.' satisfied, upon an examination of 
the case, that there is a defence to the action. The action must be
maintained in the name of the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of
the city of New-York, as plaintiff's. The commissioner, with the assent 
of the corporation attorney, may compromise, settle, or discontinue, an
action so brought. From the proceeds of an action, prosecuted to
judgment and execution, or compromised, as prescribed in this section,
the corporation attorney may retain the taxable or taxed eoste. He
must pay over the remainder, to the commissioner. 
§ 1120. A physician, who knowingly gives a false certificate, or

give information relating thereto, which he can give, or knowingly
gives false information relating thereto; or a person who knowingly
makes to the commissioner of jurors, or to a person acting by his
authority, a false representation, as to the identity, residence, or any
other matter, relating to the liability of himself, or any other person,
to serve as a trial juror, forfeits fifty dollars for each offence. 
§ 1122. A person who gives, pays, promises, or offers, money, or any
other thing, to the commissioner of jurors, the sheriff, the county clerk, 
or other clerk of a court; or to the deputy of, or a pergon employed by,
the county clerk or other clerk of a. court; or to an officer, messenger, 
or other person, employed by the sheriff, or the commissioner of jurors;

after, to inform the commissioner of jurors thereof, is guilty of a mis­
demeanor. 
§ 1125. A person, who swears falsely in an affidavit, or testifies falsely
upon an inquiry, made as prescribed in this article, is guilty of per­ 
jury, in a. case where falsely swearing, in an affidavit, used upon a
motion in a civil action, or falsely testifying, upon the trial of an issue

supreme court, resipiug in the connty, the judges of the city court of
Brooklyn, the county judge, and the justices of sessions of the county, 
to attend, at his office, on a day designated by him, not less than four-
teen nor more than twenty days, before the day appointed for holding
a term of a court of record int.he county, at which issues of fact are
triable by jury, in order to witness and assist in the drawing of trial
jurors, for that term. The number of trial jurors, to be drawn for each 
term, may be fixed by the judge who is to preside at or bold tlie term,
by an order under bis band, delivered to the commissioner. If the
number has not been so fixed, at the time of the drawing, one hundred
and thirty-two trial jurors must be drawn for the term. 
§ 1141. If two or more of the jud~s, specified in the ]ast section,
attend with or without one or more Justices of sessions, the commis- 
sioner must break the seal of the box containing the ballots, open it,
and exhibit the ballots for their inspection ; together with bis original
and each supplemental list of trial jurors, and also the verified tran-
eeripts thereof, filed in the county clerk's office. The ballots, contain-
ing the names of trial jurors, excused from service. for the whole or
a portion of a previous term of a court of record in the county, which
have not already been replaced in the box, to be redrawn, must then
be replaced therein; and the judges attending the drawing, must take 
ca.re, when the seal is broken, that they aro so replaced. If a supple-
mental list bas been made, and a transcript filed since the last draw-
ing, ballots, containing the names appearing therein must, at the
same time, be placed in the box. The judges and the commissioner,
or a. majority of them, must appoint one of the attending officers to
draw tho ballots from the box, and another to eheekmark the draw- 
ing as it proceeds, upon a. copy of the lists, transcripts of which have
been filed with the county clerk. 
§ 1142. The commissioner must then shake the box containing the
ballots, so as thoroughly to mix them. The person, appointed for that
purpose, must then, without seeing the name contained in any ballot,
publicly draw one ballot from the box, and read aloud the contents
thereof. If the drawing is for trial jurors, to servo h the city court of
Brooklyn, and the person drawn does not reside in that city, the ballot
must be retumed to the box; but if he resides in that city, or if the
drawing is for trial jurors, to serve in another court, the person ap-
pointed to checkmark the drawing, must place, opposite the name of 
the person drawn, upon the copy of the listis, the figure one. The 
ballot must then be deposited in a second box, provided for that pur­
pose, and constructed like the first box. Another ballot must then be 
drawn, in like manner, from the first box: and the same process must
be repeated, until the requisite number bas been drawu; except that.
each name must be cbeckmarked in its numerical order. 
§ 1143. When the drawing is completed, the commissioner, and the
judges by whom it was conducted, must sign e. minute, at the end of
the copy of the lists, upon which the cbeckma.rks have beeu made, 
setting forth that the trial jurors, whose names are contained therein,
were duly drawn by them, for the court and the term therein specified,
in the order denoted by the figures. The judges must then close each
box; and place upon the cover thereof, their seals, which mu.st not be
broken, except when necessary for a subsequent drawing. 
§ 1144. The proceedings, upon each subsequent drawing, are the
same ; but the list, must be checkmarked with numbers, commencing 
with the number next in order, after the last number used at the pre-
ceding drawing. 
§ 1145. After all the ballots have been drawn from the first box, and
deposited in the second box, the commissioner must make a new list, 
by copying the lists used upon the preceding drawings, omitting the
checkmarks. He must then correct it, by properly indicating each per­
son who has been found to be disqualified, exempt, dead, or not resi­
dent within the county; and each person, who bas been excused, and
for what time. Thereafter, when trial jurors are drawn, the ballots
must be drawn from the second box; the names must be cbeckmarked
on the corrected list; and the ballots not used must be deposited in the
first box; except that where a ballot is drawn, containing the name of
a person indicated, on the corrected list, as disqualified, exempt, dead,
or non-resident, it must be destroyed; and a. ballot, contaiuing the
name of a person who bas been excused, for a period then unexpired,
must be returned to the box from which it was drawn, without check-
mark.ing. 
§ 1146. Immediately after each drawing of trial jurors, the commis­
sioner must prepare a panel, verified by his affidavit, containing the
names of the jurors drawn, with the proper additions of each, and
stating for what court and for what term, they were drawn. He must
transmit the panel to the sheriff of the county, who must keep it on file,
in bis office, for public inspection. The sheriff must forthwith not.ify
each juror named therein, to attend the term for which he was drawn,
by serving upon him a notice to that effect, addressed to him. The
notice may be served personally, or by leaving it at the juror's resi­
dence, or usual place of business, with a person of proper age and dis­
cretion. It must specify the days, during which the juror is required
to be present; and it may contain copies of such portions of this article,
as the sheriff deems proper. 
§ 1147. The thirty-six trial jurors, first drawn for a term, or such
other number as the judge, appointed to hold or preside at the term, 
directs, must be notified to be present, during the first six days of the
term; aud the thirty-six trial jurors next drawn, <'1' such other number
as the judge directs, must be notified to be present, during the next six
days of the term; and a like number during each succeeding six days.
The jud~e, holding or presiding at the term, may, in bis discretion, on
the application of a trial juror, excuse him, from the whole or a pari 
of the time of service, required of him. The judge may also chauge
the time of service of a. juror to a. later day, during the same, or a sub- 
sequent term of the court. Each juror, whose time of service is changed 
to a day certain, must attend, at the opening of court on that day, and
thereafter until discharged, without further notice. If he fails so to do,
be is liable to the same punishment, as if he had been personally noti-
fied by the sheriff", to attend the term, and to be present on that day.
The clerk of the court must enter in a book, kept for that purpose, the
name of each juror, who is so excused, or whose time of service is
changed. 
§ 1148. Before the commencement of each term of a court, for which
trial jurors have been drawn, as prescribed in this article, the sheriff
must file, with the clerk, the panel, or a copy of the panel, with a
returu, under his hand, iudorsed thereupon, or annexed thereto, show- 
ing the name and additions of each juror notified, the days during
which be was notified to attend, aud the manner in which be was
notified. 
§ 1149. At any time during the sitting of a term of a court of record
in the county, the court may direct au additional number of trial 
jurors, to be drawn for that term. The order must specify the number 
to be drawn, and the time of drawing. The drawing must be con-
ducted as prescribed in sections eleven hundred and forty-one, eleven
hundred aud forty-two, and eleven hundred and forty-three of this act,
except that notice is not required. The sheriff must forthwith notify
each juror drawn, by such a. notice as the court directs, to attend the
~rm, at the time specified in the order. 
§ 1150. In a. special proceeding, pending before the county judge of
Kings county, in which a trial jury is necessary, the judge may 
empauel a jury, from the trial jurors, who are serving, at the time, in
the court of sessions of the county. lu a special proceeding, pending 
before a judge of the city court of Brooklyn, in which a trial jury is
necessary, the judge may empanel a jury, from the trial jurors, who
are serving, at the time, in that court. If there are no jurors serving
in the court of sessions, or in the city court, as the . case may be, the
judge may make an order, requiring the commissioner of jurors to
draw the number of trial jurors, designated therein; whereupon the
commissioner must draw the requisite number, and the sheriff must
notify them, as prescribed in this article, for drawing and notifying
other trial jurors. 
§ 1151. The board of supervisors of the county must allow to each
ju<lge, including each justice of the supreme court, for the services 
P
erformed by him, as prescribed in this article, such compensation, as 
th
b d d
bl d
e oar eems reasoua e an proper.
§ 1152. Where a person, duly drawn and notified to attend a term of 
a court of record, as a trial juror, fails to attend, at the time specified
in the notice, or from day to day, the court, at that term, must impose
upon him a flue of twenty-five dollars, for each day that be fails so to 
attend, This section applies to a special juror, as well as to an ordi-
uary trial juror. 
§ 1153. Where a person, duly drawn and notified, fails to attend and
serve, at a term of a court of record, as required by law, without hav- 
iug been excused, the court, besides imposing a fine, as prescribed in
the last section, may direct the sheriff' to anest him, and bring him 
before the court; and, when he bas been so brought, it may, in its
discret.iou, compel him to serve. 
§ 1154. The commissioner of jurors must cause a notice to be served
up"on each delinquent trial juror, returned as having been fined, stating 
the sum in which, and the term e.t which be was fined, and requiring
him to show cause, if he has e.ny, before the board, specified in this section, e.t the commissioner's office, on a day, not less than three days
thereafter, and at an hour specified in the notice, why the fine should
be remitted. The commiseioner must notify the justices of the supreme
court, residing in the county, the county judge, and the chief-judge of
the city court of Brooklyn, to attend at the same time and place, and
act with him as a board, for the remission and enforcement of jury 
fines. It is their duty to attend, and act accordingly. The commis­
sioner, and two of those justices or judges, constitute a quorum. The
board may, in its discretion, hear testimony; e.nd it may, from time to 
time, adjourn the meeting, or the hearing or final disposition of a par­
ticular. case. It may remit the whole or any part of a fine; but a fine
shall not be remitted or reduced, unless the person, upon whom it has
been imposed, or, if a reason satisfactory to the board is given, why his
affidavit cannot be furnished, another person in his behalf, makes, and
files with the commissioner, an affidavit, stating the grounds, upon
which a remission or red nction is claimed. Each e.ffi.davit, so filed,
must be kept open to public inspection. 
§ 1155. The commissioner of jurors must receive each fine, paid or
collected, as prescribed in this article. When ten days have expired, 
since the final disposition of a case by the board, the commissioner
must fl.le, in the office of the clerk of the court, a retum, containing the 
name of each juror fined, whose fine remains unpaid, and a statemens
of the sum remaining unpaid. The clerk must thereupon issue to the 
commissioner, a precept, under the seal of the court, specifying the
name of each person fined, and the amount of his fine remaining
unpaid ; and commanding the commissioner to levy and enforce collee­
tion of each fine, and to return the precept, with his doings thereupon,
within ninety days aft.er the receipt thereof. For the purpose of col­
lecting a fine, the commissioner must levy upon and sell the personal
property of a person fined, with Jike effect, and subject to the same pro­
visions of law, as where a sheriff levies upon and sells personal property,
by virtue of an execution, issued upon a judgment of a court of record. 
§ 1156. The commissioner must return the precept, according to its
command, to the clerk of the court issuing it. If be fails so to do, the
court may enforce the return, by attachment for contempt. When the 
precept is returned, the clerk must make, in the docket of judgments
kept by him, the same entries, as nearly as may be, with respect to 
each uncollected fine, as if it was a final judgment, rendered in an
action. If the fine was imposed at a term of the city court of Brook­
lyn, the clerk thereof must immediately transmit a transcript of the
entries, to the clerk of the county of Kings; who must file it, and
make the appropriate entries in his docket of judgments. When the
entries have been made, the fine, with interest, becomes a lien upon
the real property of the person fined, as if it was recovered by a judg­
ment in the same court; and an execution to collect it may be issued,
directed to the sheriff of the county of Kings, as upon a judgment.
The commissioner bas, in relation to the execution, and the satisfaction
of the fine, all the powers of the attorney for a party recovering such
a judgment, in relation to the judgment, and the execution issued 
thereupon. 
§ 1157. The lien, created by such a docket, must be discharged by
the county clerk, on filing with him the commissioner's certilica.ta of
payment. 
§ 1158. If the commissioner of jurors, or either of his assistants, or
a clerk or other person, employed by him, corruptly and without suffi-
cient cause, omits the name of a. person, duly drawn, from a panel of 
trial jurors, or the ballot, containing the name of such a person, from
either of the boxes prescribed in this article ; or, directly or indirectly,
receives a fee, reward, compensation, or advantage, in consideration
or, or as an inducement to such an omission; he is gnilty of a. felony,
and shall, on conviction, be punished by imprisonment in a State prison,
for a term not less than two, nor more than five years. 
§ 1159. A wilful omission, by the commissioner, of a duty required
of him by this article, other than that specified in the last section, is a 
misdemeanor.
§ 1160. A person, to whom application is made, within the county 
of Kings, by an aseessor, or by the commissioner of jurors, or either
of his assistants, for information, as to a fact, upon which the liability 
of himself, or any other person, to serve as a trial juror, depends, and
who refuses to give iuformation relating thereto, which he can give, or 
knowingly gives false information relating thereto; or a person who
knowingly makes to an assessor,' or to the commissioner of jurors, or a
person acting by his authority, a false representation as to the identity,
residence, or any other matter, relating to a. jnror, duly drawn, and
placed on a panel to be notified; or who knowingly retains, conceals, 
suppresses, or wilfully destroys, a notice to attend, left at the residence
or place of business of another, who bas been drawn as trial juror, is
guilty of a misdemeanor. 
§ 1161. A physician, who knowingly gives a false certificate, or
makes a false representation, for the purpose of enabling or assisting 
a person, to be discharged, excused, or exempted from service, as ·a
trial juror in the couuty or Kings, is gnilty of a misdemeanor. 
§ 1162. The commissioner of jurors must make a yearly report to the
board of supervisors, of all proceedings had before him, or by him, in 
the discharge of his duties; and he must pay over to the ~ounty
treasurer, at least once in each three months, all money in his bands, 
which be has received as commissioner.

§ 1168. At the opening of a term of a court of record at which issues
of fact are to be tried by jury, the clerk must cause ballots, uniform, 
as nearly as may be, in appearance, to be prepared, by writing the
name of each person, returned to the term as a trial juror, with bis
proper additions, on a separate piece of paper. He must roll up or
fold each ballot, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, so as to 
resemble the others, and so that the name is not visible. The ballots
must be deposited in a sufficient box, from which they must be drawn, 
as _prescribed in this article. 
§ 1164. When an issue of fact, to be tried by a jury, is brought to 
trial, the clerk, under the direction of the court, must openly draw,
out of the box, as many of the ballots, one after another, as are suffi­ 
cient. to form a jury.
§ 1165. Before the first ballot is drawn, the box must be closed and 
well shaken, so as thoroughly to mix the ballots ; and the clerk must
draw each ballot, without seeing the name written on any of them,
through an aperture, made in the lid of the box, large enough only 
to admit bis hand conveniently. 
§ 1166. The first t.welve persons who appear, as their names are
drawn and called, and are approved as indifferent between the parties, 
and not discharged or excused, must be sworn; and constitute the jury 
to try the issue. 
tion of the court, in reference thereto. 
§ 1167. The ballots, containing the names of the jurors so swom, 
must be then deposited in another box, and there kept, a.part from the
other ballots, until that jury is discharged. 
§ 1168. Aft.er that jury is discharged, the ballots containing their
names must be again rolled up or folded, as prescribed in section eleven
hundred and sixty-three of this act, and returned to the box, from which
they were first taken ; and the same course must be pursued, as often 
as an issue is brought to trial by a jury.
§ 1169. The ballot, containing the name of a juror, who is absent, 
when his name is drawn or called, or is set aside, or excused from serv­
ing on that trial, must be again rolled up or folded, in the same manner 
as before, and returned to the box, containing the undrawn ballots, as 
soon as the jury is sworn.
§ 1170. If an issue is brought to trial by a jury, while a jury is 
empanelled in another ca.use, at the same term, and not then discharged,
the court may order a jury, for the trial of that issue, to be drawn out
of the box containing the ballots then undrawn; but, in any other case, 
the ballots, containing the names of all the trial jurors, returned at,
and attendin~ the term, must be placed together in the same box, 
before a jury is drawn therefrom. 
§ 1171. If a sufficient number of j_urors, duly drawn and notified,
Go not attend, or cannot be obtained, to form a trial jury, the eouri 
may, in any county except Westchester, direct the sheriff to !'6'1uire
he attendance of such a number of talesmen, from the bystanders, or 
from the county &t Ia.rge, qua.lifted to serve as trial jurors, as it deem
sufficient for the purpose. In Westchester county, the court mus 
direct the sheriff to draw & sufficient number of ballots from the firs 
box, specified ih section ten hundred and thirty-eight of this act if
there is not a sufficient number of ballots remaining therein, to dra
the residue from the second box, specifled in section ten hundred an
fifty-one of this act. In any other county, except New-York an
Kings, it may, in its discretion, instead of directing him to require
t&lesmen to attend, direct him to draw a sufficient number of ballots
from the third box, specified in section ten hundred and fifty-two of
this act. In either case, the sheriff must notify the persons thus dra 
to attend forthwith, or upon a day fixed by the court. If, for any rea­
son a sufficient number of jurors to try the issue is not obtained,fro
the persons notified, under an order made as prescribed in this section,
the court may make another order, or successive orders, until a suffi­
cient number is obtained; and in making each order, the court may
exercise the same discretion,as in making the !irst order. 
§ 1172. In any county, except New-York, Kings, or Westchester, the
court may also direct the sheriff to require the attendance of such a 
number of qualified talesmen, for the trial of an issue of fact, as it deems
sufficient, where, by reason of one or more juries being empanelled, or 
for any other reason, no ballot. remains undrawn; or where, in conse-
queuce of jurors being set aside, a juror cannot be obtained, for the trial
of that issue, from the list of those returned. 
§ 1173. If, iu a case specified in the last two sections, the sheriff is a
party to the issue, the court must appoint 8. disinterested person, to act 
iu place of the sheriff. For that purpose, t.he person so appointed pos- 
&etstietS all the powers, and is subject to all the duties and liabilities of
the sheriff, with respect to the matters specified in those sections. 
§ 1174. The sheriff, or person appointed by the court, must notify the
requisite number of persons to attend, and make return thereof, as pre-
scribed in section ten hundred and forty-eight of this act; except that
each person must be required to attend forthwith. Each person 80 noti-
fied must attend forth with, and, unless excused by the court or set aside,
must serve as a juror upon the trial. For a neglect or refusal 80 to do,
be may be tined, in the same manner as a trial juror, regularly drawn
and notified, as prescribed in this chapter ; · and he is subject to the
same exceptions and challenges, 88 any other trial juror. 
§ 1175. It is not e. valid objection to a jury, procured as prescribed i~
the last four sections, that it contains none of the jurors origina.llyt 
returned to the term, or is only patially composed of such jurors. 
§ 1176. Upon the trial of an issue of fact, joined in a civil action, in 
& court of record, or not of record, each party may peremptorily chal-
lenge not more than two of the persons, drawn as jurors for the trial. 
§ 1177. It is not a good cause of challenge, to the panel or array ofpn
trial jurors, in an action in a. court of record, that the officer who dre"1 
them is a party to, or interested in the action, or counsel or a.ttorne)i
for, or related to, a party. 
§ 1178. It is not a good cause of challenge to the panel or array of
trial jurors, in an action in a court of record, that they were notified to
attend by an officer, who is a party to, or interested in, the action, or
related to a party; unless it is alleged in the challenge, and is estab-
Iished, that one or more of the jurors drawn were not notified, and that 
the omission was intentional.
§ 1179. In a. penal action, in a court of record, or not of record, to 
recover a sum of money, it is not a good cause of challenge to a trial
juror, or to an officer who notified the trial jurors, that the juror or the.~~:.. 
fli  li bl to ta  it to ty hi h be
o cer rs ia e pay xes, m a ci y, wn, or conn , w ic may 
benefited by the recovery.
§ 1180. An objection to the qualifications of a juror is available only 
upon a. challenge. A challenge oC a juror, or a cbanente to the panel
or array of jurors, must be tried and determined by the court only. 
ither party may except to the determination, and it may be reviewed.

where one or more exceptions are taken, to the rulings of the court, made

challenge must be beard at the same time ; and the case must contain
the matters necessary to present it, upon the facts, or the law, or both.

inquiry, or to &88088 damages, in an action in a court of record, or not. 
of record, or in a special proceeding before an officer, if the jurors can-
not agree, after being kept together, for such a time as is deemed rea­
sonable, by the court before which, or the officer before whom, they
were empanelled, t.he court or officer may discharge them, and issue a
precept for a new jury, or order another jury to be drawn, as the case
requires; and the same proceedings must be had before the new jury,
as if it was the jury first empanelled.
§ 1182. It is not necessary, in an action in a court of record, to call
the plaintiff, when the jurors are about to deliver their verdict; and
the plaintiff, in such an action, canuot submit to a nonsuit, after the
cause has been committed to the jury, to consider of the verdict. 
§ 1183. In an action to recover a sum of money only, if a verdict is
found, either in favor of the plaintiff, or in favor of a defendant, who 
bas set up a counterclaim for a sum of money, the jury must aseeee
the amount of damages. The jury may also, under the direction of 
the court, assess the amount of the damages, where the court direets
judgmeut for the plaintiff', on the pleadings. 
§ 1184. Where double, treble or othee increased damages are given
by statute, single damages only are to be found by the jury, except in 
a case where tlie statute prescribes a different rule. The sum so found
must be increased by the court, and judgment rendered accordingly. 
§ 1185. Where, upon the trial of an issue by a jury, the case presents
only questions of law, the judge may direct the jury to render a verdict, 
subject to the opinion of the court. Notwithstanding that such aver­
diet has been rendered, the judge holding the trial term may, at the 
same term, set aside the verdict, and direct judgment to be entered for
either party, with like effect and in like manner,as if such a direction
had been given at the trial. An exception to such a direction may be
taken as prescribed in section nine hundred and ninety-four of this act. 
ARTICLE SECOND. 
THB VBBDICT. 
§ 1186. A genera venue is one, y w ic e jury pronounces, gen
era.Hy, upon all or any of the issues, in favor either of the plaintiff, o
of the defendant. A special verdict is one, by which the jury fin 
the facts only, leaving the court to determine, which party is entitle
to judgmeut thereupon. 
§ 1187. In au action to recover a sum of money only, or real prop-
erty, or a chattel, the jnry ruay render a general or a special verdict,

specific questions of fact, stated under the direction of the court, are
tried by 8. jury, the co1,1rt may direct the j,~ry to. find 8. special verd~ct, 
upon all or any of the tssues. Where the jury finds a geueral verdict,
the court may instruct it to find also specially, upon one or more ques-
tions of fact, stated iu writing. The special verdict or special finding
must be in writing; it must be filed with the clerk, and entered in the 
mi nutes.
§ 1188. Where a special finding is inconsistent with a general ver- 
diet, the former controls the latter, and the court must render judgment

specific questions of fact, stated under the direction of the court, the/ 
clerk must make an entry in his minutes, specifying the time and\
place of the trial; the names of the jurors and witnesses; the verdict,( 
or the questions and findings thereupon, as the case requires; and thel
direction, if any, which the court gives, with respect to the subsequent 
proceedings. Upon the application of the party in whose favor a gen-
eral verdict is rendered, the clerk must enter judgment, in conformity
to the verdict, unless a different direction is given by the cour«, or it 
is otherwise specially prescribed by law.

§ 1212. In an action specified in section four hundred and twenty of
this act, where the summons was personally served upon the defend·
ant, and & copy of the complaint, or a notice stating the sum of money
for which jud~ent will he taken, was served with the summons} or
where the defendant has appeared, but has made default in pleading,
the plaintiff may take judgment by default, as follows: 
1. If the defendant has made default in appearing, the plaintiff
must file proof of the service of the summons, and of a copy of the
complaint or the notice, and also proof, by affidavit, that the defend ..
ant has not appeared; whereupon the. clerk must enter final judgment
in his favor. 
2. If the defendant has seasonably appeared, but has made default
in pleading, the plaintiff' must file proof of the service of the summons
and of the appearance, or of the appearance only, and also proof, by
affidavit, of the defanlt; whereupon the clerk must enter final judg ..
ment in his favor. 
If the defendant has made default in appearing or pleading, &nd
the case is not one where the clerk can enter final judgment, as pre­
scribed In either of the foregoing subdivisions of this section, the
plaintiff must apply to the court for judgment, as prescribed in section
twelve hundred and fourteen of this ect; 
§ 1213. Where final judgment may be entered by the clerk, as pre-
scribed in the last section, the amount thereof must be. determined as 
follows : '
1. If the complaint is verified, the judgment must be entered for the 
sum, for which the complaint. demands judgment; or, at the plaintiff's
option, for a smaller sum ; and if a computation of interest is necessary
it may be made by the clerk, 
2. If the complaint is not verified, the clerk must assess the amount 
due to the plaintiff', by computing the sum due upon an instrument for
the payment of money only, the non-payment of which constitutes a
cause of action, stated in the complaint; and by ascertaining, by the
examination of the plaintiff', upon oath, or by other competent proof,
the amount due to him for any other cause of action, stated in the com­
plaint. If an instrument, specified in this subdivision, has been Jost,
so that it cannot be produced to the clerk, he must take proof -:f its
loss, and of its contents. Either party may require the clerk to reduce 
to writing and file the assessment, and the oral proof, if any, taken
thereupon. 
§ 1214. Where the summons was personally served upon the defend­
ant, within the State, and he has made default in appearing, or when 
the defendant bas appeared, but has made default in pleading ; and
the case is not one, where the clerk can enter final judgment, as pre­
scribed in the last two sections, the- plaintiff must apply to the court
for judgment. Upon the application he must file, if the default was
in appearing, proof of service of the summons ; or, if the default was
in pleading. proof of appearance, and also if a copy of the complaint
was demanded proof of service thereof, upon the defendant's attorney;
and in either case, proof, by affidavit, of the default which entitles him 
to judgment. 
§ 1215. The court must thereupon render the judgment, to which the
plaintiff is entitled. It may, without a jury or with a jnry, if one is 
present in court, make a computation or assessment, or take an account,
or proof of a fact, for the purpose of enabling it to render the judg­
ment, or to carry it into effect; or it may, in its discretion, direct a 
reference, or a writ of iuquiry, for either purpose; except. that where
the action is brought to recover damages for a personal injury, or an
injury to property, the damages must be ascertained by means of 9 
writ of inquiry. Where a reference or a writ of inquiry is directed
the court may direct, that the report or inquisition be returned to t.h,.
court for its further action; or it may, in its discretion, except where
special provision is otherwise made by law, omit that direction; h~
which case, final judgment may be entered by the clerk, in accordance
with the report of the referee, or for the damages ascertained by the
inquisit.ion, without any further application. 
§ 1216. Where the summons was served upon the defendant, without
the State, or otherwise than personally, if the defendant does not
demand a copy of the complaint or plead as the case requires, within
twenty days after the service is complete, the plaintiff may apply to 
the court, for the jndgment demanded in the complaint. Upon such
an application be must file proof that the service is complete, and proof
by affidavit of the defendant's default. The court must require proof
of the cause of action, set. forth in the complaint, to be made, eit.her
before the court, or before a referee, appointed for that purpose. If the
defendant is a. non-resident, or a foreign corporation, the court must
require the plaintiff, or his agent, or attorney, to be examined on oath,
respecting any payments to the plaintiff, or to any one for his use, on
account of his demand, and must render the judgment, to which the
plaintiff is entitled. But before rendering judgment, the court may, in
any case, in its discretion, require the plaintiff to file an undertaking,
to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution of any estate
or effects which may be directed by tne judgment to be trausferred 
or delivered, or the restitution of any money that may be collected
under or by virtue of the judgment, in case the defendant or his
representative applies and is admitted to defend the action, and suc-
ceeds in his defence. 
§ 1217. A judgment shall not be rendered for a sum of money only,
upon an application made pursuant to the last section, except in an
action specified in section six hundred and thirty-five of this act.

lie is entitled to at least five days' notice of the time and place of an 
assessment by the clerk, and to at least eight days' notice of the time.

2. In a case where an application for judgment must be made to th~
court, the defendant may serve upon the plaintiff's attorney, at any
time before the application for judgment, a written demand of notic
of the execution of any reference, or writ of inquiry, which may be 
granted upon the application. Such a demand is not an appearance i
the action. It must be subscribed by the defendant, in person, or by
an attorney or agent, who must add to his signature his office address,
with the particulars, prescribed in section four hundred and seventeen
of thie act, concerning the office address of the plaintiff's attorney.
Thereupon at least five days' notice of the time and place of the exe-
cution of the reference, or writ of inquiry, must be given to the defend-

to different causes of action, set forth in the complaint, and final judg- 
ment can be taken, with respect to one or more of the causes of action,
without prejudice to either party in maintaining the action, or a defence 
or counterclaim, with respect to the other causes of action, or in the
recovery of final judgment uj.on the whole issue, the court may, in its
discretion, and at any stage of the action, direct that the action be
divided into two or more actions, as the case requires. 
§ 1221. Where one or more issues of law, and one or more issues of
fact, arise in the same action, and all the issues have been tried, final 
judgment upon the whole issue must be taken as follows:
1. Where an application must be made to the court, for judgment 
upon the issue last tried, the application must be for jndgment, upon
the whole issue; and judgment must be rendered accordingly. 
2. Where the action is triable by a jury, and the issue last tried is
tried at a term of the court, the application for judgment, upon the
whole issue, may be entertained, in the discretion of the court, at that
term, and with or without notice; if not 80 entertained, it must be

remains to be tried, and final judgment has not been directed as pre-·
cribed* in section ten hundred and twenty-one of this act, may be 
entered upon application to the court, or by tho clerk in an action·
specified in section four hundred and twenty of this act.

judgment, after the decision of an issue of law, ae prescribed in the l..n
two sections, the court bas the powers specified in section one thousand 
two hundred and fifteen of this act, upon an application for judgment
by the plaintiff. Where final judgment may be awarded ina referee's
report, as prescribed in section twelve hundred and twenty-oRe of this
act, the referee may make a computation, or an assessment, or take an
account, or proof of a fact, for the purpose of enabling him to award
the proper judgment, or enabling the court to carry it into effect; and
he may ascertain and fix the damages, as a jury may do, upon the
execution of a writ of inquiry. 
§ 1224. When an order or judgment is wholly-or partly affirmed upon
an appeal to the general term, and no issue of fad remains to be tried, 
the general term may, in its discretion, render final judgment, unless
it permits the appellant to amend or plead over. 
§ 1225. In an action triable by the court, where one or more specific
questions of fact, arising upon the issues, have been tried by a jury; 
may be taken, upon the application of either party, u 
follows:
1. If aJl the issues of fact in the action are determined by the find· 
ings of the jury, or the remaining issues of fact have been determined 
by the decision of the court, or the report of a referee, an appli­
cation for judgment, upon the whole issue, may be made as upon a
motion. 
2. Ir one or more issues of fact remain to be tried, judgment may be 
rendered upon the whole issue, at the term of the court where, or by 
direction of the referee by whom, they are tried. 
§ 1226. Where a reference has been made, to report upon one or more
specific questions of fact, arising upon the issue, and the remaining

issue of fact without a jury, may be entered by the clerk, as directed~~
therein, upon filing the decision or report.

other proceedings upon the reference, must be certified to the eourt, 
by the referee, with his report; and judgment must be rendered by
the court. 
§ 1230. In a case, not provided for in the foregoing sections of this article, where the decision, upon a trial by the court, without a jury, 
or 'the report, upon a trial by a referee directs an interlocutory judg-
ment to be entered; and the party afterwards becomes entitled to a 
final judgment, an application for the latter may be made, as upon a.
motion. And where a judgment requires the appointment of a referee, 
to do any act thereunder, the referee must be appointed by the judg-
ment or by the court, upon motion, except as otherwise prescribed in
the next section,

thereof, subscribed by the jndge or referee, is filed. Where an inter­
locutory jndgment awards costs, they may be awarded generally, with-
out specifying the amount thereof. Where the final judgment is
directed to be settled, and the costs have not been taxed, wheu the
settlement thereof is filed, a blank for the amount of the costs must be 
left in the settlement ; and the costs must be· taxed, and the blank

inquiry, upon proof, by affidavit, that error was committed, to his pre- 
judice, 'upon the hearing, or in the report, or upon the execution of
the writ or in the inquisition. In a proper case, the application may
be granted, after judgment, has been entered. In that case, the judg-
meut may be set aside, either then or after the new hearing, or the
execution of the new writ, as justice requires. 
§ 1231. A motion for judgment, upon a special verdict, may be made

at a term held by one judge.
§ 1234. A motion for judgment, upon a verdict subject to the opiniof

puted by the clerk, added to the sum awarded, and included in the
amount of the judgment.

mons; the pleadings, or copies thereof; the final judgment, and the
interlocutory judgment, if any, or copies thereof; and each paper on
file, or a copy thereof, and a copy of each order, which in any way
involves the merits, or necessarily affects the judgment. If judgment
is taken by default, the judgment-roll must also contain the papers
required to be filed, upon so taking judgment, or upon making appli­
cation therefor; together with any report, decision or writ of inquiry,
and return thereto. If judgment is ta.ken after a trial, the jud~ent­
roll must contain the verdict, report, or decision; each offer 1f any,
made as prescribed in this act; and the exceptions or case then on file. 
§ 1288. The judgment-roll must be prepared, and furnished to the
clerk, by the attoruey, for the party, at whose instance the final judg­
ment is entered; except that the clerk must attach thereto the neces­
sary original papers, on fl.le. But the clerk may, at his option, make
up the entire judgment-roll. 
§ 1239. The clerk must make a minute, upon the back of each
judgment-roll, filed in his office, of the time of filing it, specifying 
the year, month, day, hour, and minute. A proceeding to enforce
or collect a final judgment, cannot be taken, until the judgment-roll
is filed.

ishing him for a contempt of the court. 
I. Where the judgment is final, and cannot bu enforced by execu­
tion, as prescribed in the last section. 
2. Where the judgment is final, and part of it cannot be enforced
by execution, as prescribed in the last section ; in which case, the part 
or parts, which cannot be so enforced, may be enforced as prescribed
in this section. . 
3. Where the judgment is interlocutory, and requires a party to do,
or to refrain from doing, an act ; except in a case specified in the next subdivision. 
4. Where the judgment. requires the payment of money into court,
or to an officer of the court; except where the money is due upon a.
contract, express or implied, or as damages for non-performance of a
contract. In a case specified in this subdivision, if the judgment is
final, it may be enforced, as prescribed in this section, either simulta
neonsly with, or before or after the issuing of an execution thereupon,
as the court directs. 
§ 1242. Except where special provision is otherwise made by law,
real property, adjudged to be sold, must be sold in the county where 
rt is situated, by the sheriff of the county, or by a referee, appointed
by the court for that purpose, who must execute a conveyance to the 
purchaser. The conveyance is effectual, to pass the right title, or
interest of a party, adjudged to be sold; but nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to repeal or modify the provisions of any law
specially regulating the sale of real property under a judgment or a.
decree of any court, in any particular county of the State. 
§ 1248. Where a referee is appointed by the court, to sell real prop-
erty, the court may provide for his giving such security, as the court 
deems just, for the proper application of the money received upon the
sale: or for the payment thereof by the purchaser, directly to the per- 
son or persons entitled thereto, or their attorneys.
§ 1244. A conveyance of property, sold by virtue of an execution,

est was sold, and is conveyed, without naming, in that clause, any of 
tho other parties to the action ; otherwise, the purchaser is not bound 
to accept the conveyance, and, the officer executing it is liable for the
damages, which the purchaser sustains by the omission, wheth * he 
accepts or refuses to accept it.

or more books, ruled in columns, convenient for making the entries;
prescribed in the next section; in which he must docket, in it.a regular
order and according to its priority, each judgment, which he is required 
by this article to docket. The expense of procuring a new book, when
necessary, is a county charge. 
§ 1246. Each clerk, specified in the last section, must, when he files
a judgment-roll, upon a judgment, rendered in a. court of which he is
clerk, docket the judgment, by enterin~, in the proper docket-book,
the following particulars, under the Initial letter of the surname of the

docketed as preecribed in the last section, must furnish, to any person
applying therefor; and paying the fees allowed by law, one or more 
transcripts of the docket of the judgment, attested by his signature.
A county clerk, to whom such a trauseript is presented, must, upon 
payment of his fees therefor, immediately file it, and docket the judg­
ment, as prescribed in the la.st section, in the appropriate docket-book,
kept in bis office. 
§ 1248. A clerk who omits, as soon as practicable, to docket a judg-
ment required to be docketed, or to furnish a transcript of a judgment. 
10 docketed in his office, as prescribed in the laet two sections, forfeits,

the damages sustained by reason of the omission.
§ 1249. A docket-book, kept by a clerk, must he kept open, during 
the business hours fixed by law, for search and examination by any
person. 
§ 1250. A judgment, required to be docketed, as prescribed in this article, neither affects real propert.y or chuttels real, nor is entitled to 
a preference, until tbe judgment-roll is tiled, and the judgment
docketed. 
§ 1251. "Except as otherwise specially prescribed by law, a judgment,
hereafter rendered, which is docketed in a county clerk's office, 8.8 pre- 
scribed in this article, binds, and is a charge npon, for teu years after
filing the judgment-roll, and no longer, the real property and chattels
real in that county, which the judgment debtor has, at t.he time of so
docketing it, or which he acquires at any time afterwards, and within
the ten years. 
§ 1252. When ten years after filing the judgment-roll have expired,
real property or a chattel real, which the judgment debtor, or real pro-
perty which a person, deriving his right or title thereto, as the heir or 
devisee of the judgment debtor, then has, in any county, may be levied
upon, by virtue of an execution against property, issued to the sheriff
of that county, upou a judgment hereafter rendered, by filing, wit.b the
~rk of that county, a notice, subscribed by the sheriff, describing the
j.udgmeut, the execution, and the property levied upon; and, if the
interest levied upon is that of an heir or devisee, specifying that fact,
and the name of the heir or devisee. The notice must be recorded and
indexed by the clerk, as a notice of the pendency of an action. For
that purpose, the judgment debtor, or his heir or devisee, named in the
notice, is regarded as a party to an action. The judgment binds, and 
becomes a charge upon, the right and title thus levied upon, of the
judgment· debtor, or -of his heir or devisee, as the case may be, only
from the time of recording and indexing the notice, and uuti1 the exe-
cution is set aside, or returned . 
§ 1253. The interest of a person, holding a contract for the purchase
of real property, is not bound by the docketing of a judgment; and 
~nnot be levied upon or sold, by virtue of an execution issued upon a
Judgment. 
§ 1254. Where real property is sold and conveyed, and, at the same
time, & mortgage thereupon is given by the purchaser, to secure the 
payment of tiie whole or a part of the purchase-money, the lien of the
mortgage, upon that real property, is superior to the lien of a previous 
judgment ~ainst the purchaser.
§ 1255. The time, duriug which a judgment creditor is stayed, by an 
injunction or other order, or by the operation of an appeal, or by express
provision of law, from enforcing & judgment, is not a part of the ten 
.yea.rs, to which the lien of a judgment is limited by this article. But
this section does not extend the time of the lien, as against a purchaser, 
creditor, or mortgagee in good faith.
§ 1256. Where an appeal from a judgment has been perfected, and 
an undertaking baa been given, sufficient to entitle the appellant to a
stay of the execution of the judgment, without an order for that pur- 
pose, thecourt in which the jud~ent was recovered, may, in its dis-
cretion and upon such terms as Justice requires, make an order, upon 
·notice to the attorney for the respondent, and to the sureties in the 
undertaking, exempting from the lien of the judgment, as against
judgment creditors, and purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, the
real property or chattels real, upon which the judgment is a lien, or a
portion thereof, specifically described in the order. If all the property,
subject to the lien, is so exempted, the order must direct the clerk, in
whose office the judgment-roll is filed, to make an entry, on the docket
of the judgment, in each place where it appears in the docket-book;
substantially as follows : " Lien suspended upon appeal. See order
entered"; adding the proper date. If a portion only is exempted, the
order must direct the clerk to make, in like manner, an entry, substan­
tially as follows: " Lien partially suspended upon appeal. See order
entered"; adding the proper date. The clerk must, when he files the
motion papers, and enters the order, make the entry or entries in the
docket-book, as required by the order. 
§ 1257. Where an order is made, as prescribed in the l&llt section, by
the supreme court or by a county court, it operates as a suspension of
the lien upon property situated in the county, where the judgment-roll 
is filed, from the time when the order is entered, and the proper entry
made in the docket-book. If the property exempted is situated in
another county, or if the order was made by a court, other than the
supreme court or a county court, the order operates as a suspension,
from the time, when the proper entry is made in the docket-book, kept
by the clerk of that county, as prescribed in the next section. 
§ 1258. The clerk, with whom the order is entered, must, upon pay­ 
ment of his fees therefor, fumish to the party who obtained the order,
one or more transcripts, attested by hie signature, of the docket of the 
judgment, including the entry made upon the docket. A county clerk,
in whose office the judgment is docketed, must, upon payment of his
fees therefor, immediately file such a transcript; and make an entey
upon the docket of the judgment, in each place where it appears in hi!!
docket-book., substantially as follows: "Lien suspended", or, "Lien 
partially suspended", accordinl to the entry upon the original docket,
and also, " See transcript filed ' ; adding the proper date. 
§ 1259. At any time after a judgment, which has ceased to be a lien,
as prescribed in the last three sections, is affirmed, or the appeal
therefrom is dismissed, the lien thereof may be restored, as follows : 
1. The clerk, in whose office the judgment of affirmance, or the order
dismissing the appeal, is entered, must, upon the request of the judg­
ment creditor, docket the judgment anew, as it was originally docketed,
but in the order ()f priority of the new docket; and he must write
upon the new doc"'ket, the words, " Lien restored by redocket"; adding
the date of redocketing. 
2. A transcript of the new docket must be furnished to a county
clerk, in whose office an entry of the suspension of the lien bas been
made, as prescribed in the last two iwctions; and thereupon the judg­
ment must be docketed byhim anew, in the order of the priority of
the new docket. The clerk who so redockete the judgment, must make
an entry upon the new docket, substantially as follows : "Lien restored
by redocket. See transcript filed" ; aduing the date of redoeketing in
his county. 
The lien of the judgment is thereupon restored, for the unexpired
period thereof, as if the order had not been made ; but with like effect
only, as against jud~ent creditors, purchasers, and mo~eea in
good faith, as if the Judgment bad then been first docketed. 
§ 1260. The docket of a judgment must be cancelled and discharged 
by the clerk, in whose office the judgment-roll is filed, upon filing with
him & sa.tisfaction-piece, describing the judgment, and executed as 
follows:
1. Except as otherwise prescribed in the next subdivision, the satis­ 
faction-piece must be executed by the party, in whose favor the judg­
ment was rendered, or his executor or administrator; or, if it is made
within two years after the filing of the judgment-roll, by the attorney
of record of the party. But where the authority of the attorney has
been revoked, a satisfaction by him is uot conclusive, against the
person entitled to enforce the judgment, in respect to a person, who
had actual notice of the revocation, before a payment on the judgment
was made, or a purchase of property bound thereby was effected. 
2. If an assignment of the judgment, executed by the party in
whose favor it was rendered, or his executor or administrator, has been
filed in the clerk's office, the satisfaction-piece most be executed by the
person, who appears, from the &ssignment, or from the last of the sub­
sequent assignments, if any, so filed, showing a continuous chain of title, to be the owner of the judgment; or by his executor or adminis­ 
trator.
3. If the satisfaction-piece is executed by an attorney in fact, in 
behalf of a person authorized to execute it, other than the attorney
f record, an instrument, containing a power to acknowledge the satis­
faction, must be filed with the satisfaction-piece, unless it has been
recorded, in the proper book for recording deeds, in that or another
county ; in which case, the satisfaction-piece must refer to the record,
and the clerk may, for his own indemnity, require evidence of a record
remaining in another office. 
The execution of each satisfaction-piece or power of attorney must
be acknowledged, before the clerk, or his deputy, and certified by him
thereupon; or it must be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in
like manner as a deed to be recorded in the county where it is filed. 
§ 1261. The person, entitled to enforce a judgment, must execute, and
acknowledge before the proper officer, a satisfaction-piece thereof, at
the request of the judgment debtor, or of a person interested in prop-
erty bound by the judgment, upon presentation of a satisfaction-piece,
and payment of the sum due upon the judgment, and the fees allowed
by law for ta.king the acknowledgment of a deed. 
§ 1262. A person, who has heretofore executed, or hereafter executes,
a written assignment of a judgment, owned by him, wit bout acknowl-
edging the executed* thereof, before an officer authorized to take the 
acknowledgment of a deed, must so acknowledge it, at the request of
his assignee, or of a subsequent assignee thereof, or of the judgment
debtor, upon presentation of the assignment, and payment of the offi-
cer's fees. 
§ 1263. A resident of the State, or a person having an office within
the Sta.te, for the regular transaetion of bueiuess, in person, who
becomes the owner of a judgment, by virtue of a general assi~ment 
for the benefit of creditors, or of an appointment as a receiver, or
trustee or assignee of an insolvent debtor or bankrupt, may file with
the clerk, in whose office the judgment-roll is filed, a notice of the 
&88ignment, or of his appointment, and of his ownership of the judg-
ment. The notice must be subscribed by him, adding to bis signature
his place of residence, and also, if he resides without the State, his 
office address. A notice so filed has the same force and effect, for the
purposes of this article, as if it was an assignment of the judgment. 
§ 1264. Where an execution is returned, wholly or partly satisfied,
the clerk must make an entry of the satisfaction, or partial satisfac­ 
tion, in the docket of the judgment, upon which it was issued. There­
upon the judgment is deemed satisfied, to the extent of the amount 
returned as collected, unless the return is vacated by the court. 
§ 1265. Where an execution is returned wholly unsatisfied, the clerk
must immediately make, in the docket of the judgment, upon which it 
was issued, an entry of the fact, stating the time when the execution
was returned. 
§ 1266. A sheriff, upon being paid the full amount due upon an exe­
cution in his hands, must immediately indorse thereupon a. return of
satisfaction thereof. He must also deliver, to the person making the 
payment, upon the latter's request, and payment of the fees allowed
by law therefor, a certified copy of the execution, and of the return of 
satisfaction thereupon; which may be filed with the clerk of the same
county, who must thereupon cancel and discharge the docket of the
judgment, as if the judgment-roll was filed in his office, and the execu­
tion was returned to him, as satisfied. But this section does not exon­
erate the sheriff, from his duty to return the execution, to the clerk
with whom the judgment-roll is filed. 
§ 1267. The clerk of a county, with whom a judgment has been
docketed, must cancel and discharge the docket thereof, upon the
filing, with him, of a certificate of the clerk, with whom the jndgment- 
roll is filed, showing that the judgment has been reversed, vacated, or
satisfied of record; or the certificate of the clerk of the county, with 
whom a copy of an execution, and of a return of satisfaction thereupon,
have been filed, as prescribed in the last section, showing that they
have been so tiled, and the docket cancelled and dischar~ed accordingly. 
§ 1268. At any time after two years have elapsed, smce a bankrupt
was discharged from his debts, pursuant to the acts of'Congrese relating 
to bankruptcy, he may apply, upon proof of his discharge, to the court
in which a judgment was rendered against him, for an order, directing
the judgment to be cancelled and discharged of record. If it appears
that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment, an
order must be made accordingly; and thereupon the clerk must cancel
and discharge the docket thereof, as if the proper satisfaction-piece of
the judgment was filed. Notice of the application, accompanied with
copies of the papers upon which it is made, must be given to the judg­
ment creditor, unless bis written consent to the granting of the order,
with satisfactory proof of the execution thereof, and, if he is not the
party in 'Whose favor the judgment was rendered, that he is the owner
thereof, is presented to the court, upon the application. 
§ 1269. A court of record has the same power and jurisdiction, con-
d 
cerning the ocket of its judgments, kept by a county clerk, which it
has concerning the docket, kept by its own clerk. It may direct that 
such a docket be amended; or that its judgment, there docketed, be 
docketed nunc pro tune.
§ 1270. Upon the p1·esentation, to the clerk of a court of record, of an 
assignment of a judgment, entered iu his office, executed by a person
entitled to satisfy the judgment, as prescribed in section one thousand 
two hundred and sixty of this act, and otherwise executed as prescribed
in that section, with respect to a satisfaction-piece, and upon payment
of the fees, allowed by law, for filing a transcript, and docketing a 
judgment thereupon, the clerk must forthwith file the assignment in
bis office, and make, upon the docket. of the judgment, an entry of the
fact, and of the day of tiliug : or, if he keeps a separate book for the
entry of assignments of judgments, an entry, referriug to the page of 
the book, where the filing of the assignment is noted.
§ 1272. Thie article applies only to a judgment, wholly or partly for 
a sum of money, or directing the payment of a sum of money; and 
to &n execution issued upon such a judgment.

§ 1273. A judgment by confession ruay be entered, without action,
either for money due or to become due, or to secure a person against 
contingent liability in behalf of the defendant, or both, as prescribed
in this article. A married woman may confess such a judgment, if the 
debt was contracted for the benefit of her separate estate, or in the
eourse of any trade or oth- r bueiuesscanied ou by heronhereoleandsepa-
rate account. 
§ 1274. A written statement m118t be made, and signed by the defend-
ant, to the following effect: 
l. H must state the sum, for which judgment may be entered, and
authorize tha entry of judgment. therefor. 
2. If the judgmeut to be confessed is for money due or to become
due, it mnst state concisely the facts, out of which the debt arose; and
must show, that the sum confessed therefor is justly due, or to become
due. 
3. If the judgment to be confessed is for the purpose of securing the 
plaintiff, against a contingent liability, it must state concisely the facts,
eonstitutlng the liability; and must show, that the sum confessed
therefor does not exceed the amount of the liability. 
The statement must be verified by the oath of the defendant, to the
effect, that the matters of fact therein set forth are true. 
§ 1275. At any time within three years after the statement is verified,
it may be filed with a county clerk, or with the clerk of a superior city 
court, or, where the sum, for which judgment is confessed, does not
exceed two thousand dollars, exclusive of interest from the time of
making the statement, with the clerk of the marine court of the city
of New-York. Thereupon the clerk must enter, in like manner as a
judgment is entered in au action, a judgment for the sum coufe~ed,
with costs, which he must tax, to the amount of fifteen dollars, besides
disbursements taxable iu an action. If the statement is filed with a. 
county clerk, the judgment must be entered in the supreme court; if it
is filed wit.h the clerk of another court, specified iu this section, tho
judgment must be entered in the court of which he is clerk. But a
judgment shall not be entered upon such a statement, after the defend­ 
ant's death.
§ 1276. The clerk immediately at'ter entering tho judgment must 
attach togather* and file the statement, as verified, anJ. a. copy of the
judgment ; which constitutes the judgment-roll. The judgment may 
be docketed, and enforced ~ainst pro~rty, in t~e same manne!, and
with the same effect, as a Judgment m an action, rendered rn t.be 
same court; and each provision of law, relating to a judgment in an
action, and the proceedings subsequent thereto, apply to a judgment 
thus takeu.
§ 1277. Where the debt, for which the judgment is rendered, is not 
all cine, execution may be issued, upon the judgment, for the collection
of the sum which has become due. The execution must be in the form
prescribed by law, for an execution upon a judgment for the full amount
recovered; but the person, whose name is subscribed to It, must in­
dorse thereupon a direction to the sheriff, to collect ouly the sum due,
et.ating the amount thereof, with interest thereon, and the costs of the
judgment. Notwithstanding the issuing and collection of such an ex­
ecution, the judgment shall remain, as security for the sum or sums to
become due, after the execution is issued. When a further sum be­ 
comes due, an execution may, in like manner, be issued for the collec­
tion thereof; and successive executions may be issued, as further sums
become due. 
§ 1278. One or more joint debtors may confess a judgment for a joint
debt, dne or to become dne. Where all the joint debtors do not unite 
in the confession, the judgment must be entered and enforced against
those only who confessed it; and it is not a ba.r to an action against all
the joint debtors, upon the same demand.

1281. Subsequent proceedings regulated. 
§ 1279. The parties to a question in difference, which might be the
subject of an action, being of full age, may agree upon a case, con­
taining a statement of the facts, upon which the controversy depends;
and may present a written submission thereof to a court of record,
which would have jurisdiction of an action, brought for the same cause 
The case must be accompanied with the affidavit of one of the parties,
to the effect, that the controversy is real; and that the submission is
made in good faith, for the purpose of, determining the rights of the
parties. The submission must be acknowledged or proved, and cer­
tified, in like manner as a deed, to be recorded in the county where
it is filed. 
§ 1280. The case, submission, and affidavit, must be filed in the office
of the clerk of the court, to which the submission is made. If the sub- 
mission is made to the supreme court, they must be filed in the office
of the county clerk, if any, specified in t.he submission; if no county
clerk is so specified, they may be filed in the office of any county clerk.
The fl.Jing is a presentation of the submission; and thenceforth the
controversy becomes an action; and each provision of law, relating to 
a proceeding in an action, applies to the subsequent proceedings therein,
except as otherwise prescribed in the uext section. 
§ 1281. An order of arrest, an injunction, or a warrant of attachment,
cannot be granted in such an action: the costs thereof are always in 
the discretion of the court, but costs cannot be taxed, for any proceed-
Ings before notice of trial : the action must be tried by the court,
upon the case alone : and the case, submission, affidavit, and a certified
copy of the judgment, and of any order or paper, necessarily affecting
the judgment, constitute the judgment-roll. If the action is in the
supreme court, a superior city court, or the marine court of the city of
New-York, it must be tried, and judgment rendered, at the general
term. If the statement of facts, contained in the case, is not sufficient
to enable the court to render judgment, an order must be made dis-
missing the submission, without costs to either party; unless the court
permits the parties, or, in a proper case, their representatives, to file an
additional statement, which it may do, in its discretion, without preju-
dice to the original statement.

APPEALS. 
TITLE I. 
1321. Mode of cancelling ducket of reversed or modified judgment.
1322. Id. ; when reversal, etc., was by court of appeals.
1323. Restitution ; when awarded. 
§ 1293. The writ of error in a civil action or special proceeding has
been abolished.  
§ 1294. A party aggrieved may appeal, in a cue prescribed in this chapter, except where the judgment or order, of which be complains,
was rendered or me.de upon his default. 
§ 1295. The party or person appealing is designated as the appel-
lant, and the adverse party as the respondent. After an appeal is
taken to another court, the name of the appellate court must be substi-
tuted, for that of the court below, in the title of the action or special
proceediug, and in any case, the name of the county, if it is mentioned,
may be omitted; otherwise the title shall not be changed, in conse-
quence of the appeal. 
§ 1296. A person aggrieved, who is not a party, but is entitled by
law to be substituted, in place of a party; or who has acquired, since 
the making of the order, or the rendering of the judgment appealed
from, an interest, which would have entitled him to be so eubstituted, 
if it had been previously acquired, may also appeal, as prescribed in
this chapter, for an appeal by a party. But the appeal cannot be
heard, until he has been substituted in place of the party; and if he
unreasonably neglects to procure an order of substitution, the appeal
may be dismissed, upon motion of the respondent. 
§ 1297. Where the adverse party has died, since the making of the
order, or the rendering of the judgment appealed from, or where the 
judgment appealed from was rendered, after his death, in a case pre-
scribed by law, an appeal may be taken, as if he was living; but it
cannot be heard, until the heir, devisee, executor, or administrator, as
the case requires, has been substituted as the respondent. In such a
case, an undertaking required to perfect the appeal, or to stay the exe-
cution of the judgment or order appealed from, must recite the fact of
the adverse party's death; and the undertaking enures, after substi-
tution, to the benefit of the person substituted. 
§ 1298. Where either party to an appeal dies, before the appeal is
beard, or has heretofore died and the appeal has not been heard, if an 
order, substituting anotr.er person in his place, is not made, within
three mouths after his death, or where he has heretofore died within 
three months. after this section takes effect, the court, in which the
appeal is pending, may, in its discretion, make an order, requiring all
persons interested in the decedent's estate, to show cause . before it,
why the judgment or order appealed from should not be reversed or
affirmed, or the appeal dismissed, a.s the case requires. The order
must specify a day, when cause is to be shown, which must be not less
than six months after making the order; and it must designate the
mode of giving notice to the persons interested. Upon the return day
of the order, or at a subsequent day, appointed by the court, if the
proper person has not been substituted, the court, upon proof, by affi­ 
davit, that notice has been given, as required by the order, may
reverse or affirm the judgment or order appealed from, or dismiss the
appeal, or make such further order in the premises, as justice requires. 
§ 1299. Where the appeal is from one court to another, an applies-
tion for an order of substitution, as prescribed by the last three sections, 
must be made to the appellate court. Where personal service of notice
of application for an order bas been made, within the State, upon the
proper representative of the decedent, an order of substitution may be
made, upon the application of the surviving party. 
§ 1300. An appeal must be ta.ken, by serving, upon the attorney for
the adverse party, as prescribed in article third of title sixth of chapter 
eighth of this act, and upon the clerk, with whom the judgment or
order appealed from is entered, by filing it in his office, a written
notice, to the effect, that the appellant appeals from the judgment or
order, or from a specified part thereof. 
 
§ 1301. Where the appeal is from a. final judgment, or from a final
order in a special proceeding, and the appellant intends to bring up; 
for review thereupon, an interlocutory judgment, or an intermediate
order, he must, in the notice of appeal, distinctly specify the inter­
locutory judgment, or intermediate order, to be reviewed. 
§ 1302. If the attorney for the adverse party is dead; or if he baa
been removed, and notice of the removal has been served upon the 
appellant's attorney, and another attorney has not been substituted in
his place ; or if, for any reason, service of a notice or appeal, upon the 
proper attorney for the adverse party, cannot, with due diligence, be
made within the State, the notice of appeal may be served upon the
respondent, in the manner prescribed by law for serving it upon an
attorney. If personal service upon the respondent cannot, with due
diligence, be so made within the State, the notice of appeal may be
served upon him, and notice of the subsequent proceedings may be
given to him, as directed by a judge of the court, in or to which the
ap1,>ea.l is ta.ken. · 
§ 1303. Where the appellant, seasonably and in good faith, serves
the notice of appeal, either upon the clerk or upon the adverse party,
or his attorney, but omits, through mistake, inadvertence, or excusable 
neglect, to serve it upon the other, or to do any other act, necessary to 
perfect the appeal, or to stay the execution of the judgment or order
appealed from ; the court, in or to which the appeal is taken, upon
proof, by affidavit, of the facts, may, in its discretion, permit the
omission to be supplied, or an amendment to be made, upon such
terms as justice requires. 
§ 1304. An appeal cannot be taken from an order made by a judge;
out of court, until it is entered in the office of the proper clerk. W·here 
such an order has not been 80 entered, or the papers, upon which it
was founded, have not been filed in the same clerk's office; the judge 
who made it, or, if he is absent, or unable or disqualified to act, a
judge or the court, in or to which an appeal therefrom may be taken, 
must, upon the application of a party or other person, entitled to take
such au appeal, make an order, requiring the omission to be supplied,
within a specified time after service of a copy of the order made by
him. Upon proof, by affidavit, that a. copy of the latter order has
been served, and that the omission has not been supplied, the same
jud~e may make, upon notice, an order revoking and annulling the
original order. The provisions of the last section but one apply to the
service of an order, or a notice, as prescribed in this section. 
§ 1305. An undertaking, which the appellant is required, by this chapter, to give, or any other act which he is so required to do, for the
securit.y of the respondent, may be waived by the written consent of 
the respondent,
§ 1306. Where the appellant is required, by this chapter, to t·ve an 
d
undertaking, he may, in lieu thereof, eposit with the cler , with 
whom the judgment or order appealed from is entered, a. sum of
money, equal to the amount, for which the undertaking is required
to be given. The deposit has the same effect, as tiling the under­
taking; and notice that it bas been made, has the same effect, as
notice of the filing and service of a copy of the undertaking. The
court, wherein the appeal is pending, may direct the mode, in which
the money shall be kept and disposed or, during the pendency, or after
the determination of the appeal. 
§ 1307. An undertaking, given as prescribed in thiB chapter, must 
be fl.led with the clerk, with whom the judgment or order appealed
from is eu tered. 
~ mos. The court, in which the appeal is pending, npon satisfactory
proof, by affidavit, that siuce she execution of an undertaking, given 
as prescribed in this chapter, 011e or more of the sureties therein have
become insolvent; or that his or their circumstances have become so pre- 
carious, t~* there is reason to apprehend, that the undertaking is not
sufficient for the seenrity of the respondent; may make an order, re·
quiring the appellant to tile a new undertaking, and to serve a copy
thereof, as required with respect to the original undertaking. If the
appellant fails so to do, within twenty days after the service of a copy 
or the order, or- such further time as the court allows, the appeal must 
be dismissed, er the order or judgment, from which the appeal is taken,
must be executed, as if the original undertaking bad not been given. 
§ moo. An action shall not be maintained, upon an undertaking,
given upon an appeal, taken. as prescribed in title third, fourth or tift.h 
of this chapter, until ten days have expired, since the service, upon
the attorney for tlre appellant, of a written notice of the entry of a 
j udgrnent or order, affirming the judgment or order appealed from, ar
dismissing the appeal. Where an appeal to the court of appeals, from
that judgment or order, is perfected, and security is given thereupon, 
to stay the execution of the judgment or order appealed from, an action 
shall not be maintained upon the undertaking, given upon the preced- 
ing appeal, until a(ter the final determination of the appeal to the
court of appeals. 
§ 1310. When an appeal has been perfected, as prescribed in this chapter, and the other acts, if any, required to be done, to stay the 
execution of the judgment or order appealed from, have been done,
the appeal stays alf proceedings to enforce the judgment or order 
appealed from; except that the court or judge, from whose determina-
tion the appeal is taken, mo.y proceed in any matter, included iu the
action or special proceeding, and not affected by the judgment or order
appealed from, or not embraced within the appeal ; or may cause per-
ishable property to be sold, pursuant to the judgment or order appealed
from. The proceeds of such a sale must be paid, to abide tbe result
of the appeal, into the court, from or in which the appeal is taken ; or,
if it was taken as prescribed in title tilth of this chapter, into the 
suereme court.
~ 1311. Where an appeal, taken, from a final judgment, to the coust 
of appeals, has been perfected, and the security, required to stay the
execution of the judgment, has been given; or where the security, 
given upon au appeal, t.aken from a final judgment of the supreme.court,
a eu perior city court, a county court, or the marine court of the city of New-
York, is equal to that required to perfect an appeal to the court of ap-
peals, and to stay the execution of the judgmeut ; the court, in which
the judgment appealed from was rendered, may, in its discretion, and
upon such terms as justice. requires, make an order, upon notice to the
respondent, and the sureties in the undertaking, discharging a. Jev.y
upon personal property, made by virtue of an execution, issued upon
the judgment appealed f:r0tn. But this eection.does not, authorize the
discharge of a levy, made by virtue of a warrant of attachment.. 
§ 1312. Where an appeal is taken, as prescribed in. title second or
fourth of this chapter, the court, ill or from which the appeal is taken ; 
or, where an appeal is taken as prescribed in title third or fifth of this chapter, the court, to which t~ appeal is taken; may, in its disr.retiou, 
make an order, upon notice to the respondent, dispensing with or lim­
iting the securit.y, required to stay the execution of the judgment or 
order appealed from, as follows : 
1. Where the appellant is an executor, administrator, trustee, or
other person acting in another's right, the security may be dispensed
with or limited, hr the discretion of the court. 
2. The aggregate sum, in which one or more undertakings are re
quired to be given, may be limited to not less than fifty thousand dol 
lars, where it would otherwise exceed that sum. 
§ rnrn. Upon an appeal, taken by the people of the State, or by a
State officer, or board of State officers, the service of the notice of ap­ 
peal perfects t.he appeal, and stays the execution of the judgment or
order appealed from, without an undertaking, or other security. 
§ 1814. u1on an appeal, taken by a domestic municipal corporation,
the service O the notice of appeal perfects the appeal, and stays the exe­
cution of the judgment or order appealed from, without an underta.kin~, 
or other security ; except that, where an appeal is taken, as prescribed
in tit.le second, third or fourth of this chapter, the court, in or from
which the appeal is taken, may, in its discretion, require security to be
given. In that case, the form, nature, and extent of the security, not
exceeding that which is required in a like case, from a natural person,
and the time and manner in which it must be given, must be pre­
scribed by the order of the court; and the mayor, comptroller, or coun­
sel to the corporation, may execute, in behalf of the corporation, an 
undertaking, so required to be given.
§ 1315. Where an appeal is taken from a final judgment, as pre­ 
scribed in title second or third of this chapter, the appellant must, 
within twenty days after it is perfected, cause a certified copy of the
notice of appeal, of the judgment-roll, and of a case or notice of excep­
tions, if any, filed after the entry of judgment, to be transmitted to 
the appellate court, by the clerk, upon whom the notice of appeal was
served. Where an appeal from an order, or a part of an order, is taken
as prescribed in title secoud, third, or fifth of this chapter, the appel­
lant must, wit.bin the same time, cause a certified copy of the notice
,f appeal, of the order, and of the papers upon which the order was
founded, to be transmitted to the appellate court, by the same clerk.
If the appellant fails so to do, the respondent may cause those papers 
to be so transmitted; and he is entitled to tax the expense thereof, as
a disbursement, where he recovers costs. The clerk of the appellate
court must file the papers t10 transmitted; and, except where it is other­
wise specially prescribed by law, the appeal must be heard upon them. 
§ 1316. An appeal, ta.ken from a final judgment, brings up for
review, an interlocutory judgment, or au intermediate order, which is 
specified in the notice of appeal, and necessarily affects the final j udg­
ment; and which has not already been reviewed, upon a separate 
appeal therefrom, by the court or the term of the court, to which the
appeal from the final judgment is taken. The right to review an inter­ 
locutory judgment, or an intermediate order, as prescribed in this sec­
tion, is not affected by the expiration of the tijte, within which a
separate appeal therefrom might have been ta.ken . 
§ 1317. Upon an appeal from a jud~ent or an order, the court, or
the general term, to which the appeal 1s taken, may reverse or affirm
wholly or partly, or may modify, the judgment or order appealed from'
and ea.ch interlocutory judgment or intermediate order, which it i~
authorized to review, as specified in the notice of appeal, and as to auy 
or all of the parties; and it may, if neeeesary or proper, grant a new
trial or hearing. A judgment, affirming wholly or partly a judgment, 
from which an appeal has been taken, shall not, expressly and in
terms, a.ward to the respoudent, a sum of money, or other relief, which 
WM awarded to him by the judgment so affirmed.
§ 1318. Where a judgment, from which an appeal is taken, ~When 
reversed upon the appeal, and a new trial is granted, an appeal canno
be ta.ken from the judgment of reversal ; but upon an appeal from th
order granting a. new trial, taken, as prescribed by law, the judgmen 
of reversal must also be reviewed.
§ 1319. Where a judgment, from which an appeal has been taken, 
from one court to another, is wholly or partly affirmed, or is modified,
upon the appeal, it must be enforced, by the court in which it was ren-
dered, to the extent permitted by the determination of the appellate 
court, as if the appeal therefrom bad not been taken.
§ 1320. Where a final order, from which an appeal bas been taken, 
from one court to another, as prescribed in title fifth of this chapter, is
wholly or partly affirmed, or is modified, upon the appeal, the appellate 
court may enforce its order, or may direct the proceedings to be remit-
ted, for that purpose, to the court below, or to the judge who made the
order appealed from. 
§ .1821. Where a final judgment for a sum of money, or directing
the payment of a sum of money, bas been reversed, or has been affirmed 
as to part only of the sum, upon an appeal, taken as prescribed in title
third or fourth of this chapter; and an appeal to the court of appeals is 
not taken and perfected, and the security required to stay execution is
not given, within ten days after the entry of the judgment upon the
appeal, in the clerk's office where the judgment appealed from is
entered, the clerk must make a minute of the reversal of the judgment,
or of the amount to which it bas been reduced, upon his docket-book,
in each place, where the judgment is docketed. A transcript of the
docket, as thns corrected, must be furnished by him, and may be filed
in any county clerk's office, where the original judgment is docketed,
as prescribed by law, with respect to the original docket; and there-
upon the county clerk must correct his docket accordingly. The lien
of a judgment, the docket of which is not corrected, as prescribed in
this section, remains unaffected by the reversal or modification thereof,
until the decision of the court of appeals, upon an appeal from the
judgment reversing or modifying the same, or the expiration of the
time to take such an appeal. 
§ 1322. Where a final judgment for a sum of money, or directing the
payment of a sum of money, bas been reversed, or affirmed as to part 
only of the sum, upon. an appeal to the court of appeals, the docket
may be corrected, as prescribed in the last section, at any time after 
the remittitnr has been filed in the court below.
§ 1323. Where a final judgment or order is reversed or modified, 
upon appeal, the appellate court, or the general term of the same court,
as the case may be, may make or compel restitution of property or of a 
right, lost by means of the erroneous judgment or order; but not so as
to affect the title of a purchaser, in good faith and for value, where
property bas been sold, the court may compel the value, or the pur-
chase price, to be restored, or deposited to abide the event of the action, 
as justice requires. ·

ment-roll filed. An appeal to the court of appeals, from an order, must 
be taken within sixty days after service, upon the attorney for the
appellant, of a copy of the order appealed from, and a written notice,
of the ·entry thereof. 
§ 1826. To reuder a notice of appeal, to the court of appeals, eff'ect­
ual, for any purpose, except in a case where it is specially prescribed
by law, that security is not necessary, to perfect the appeal, the appel­
lant must give- a written undertaking, to the effect, that he will pay all 
costs and damages, which maybe awarded age.inst him on the appeal, not
exceeding five hundred dollars. The appeal is perfected, when such
an undertaking is given and a copy thereof, with notice of the filing
thereof, is served, as prescribed in this tit.le. 
§ 1327. If the appeal is taken from a. judgment for a sum of money;
or from a judgment O'P order, directing the payment of a snm of money,

dismissed, he will pay the sum, recovered or directed to be paid, by
the judgment or order, or the part thereof, as to which it is affirmed.
Bat where the judgment or order directs the payment of money in 
fixed instalments, the undertaking must be to the effect, that the appel­
lant will pay each instalment, wbicb becomes payable, pending the
appeal, or ·the pad thereof as to which the judgment or order is affirmed, 
not exceeding a sum specified in the undertaking, wllich must be fixed

afterwards, upon satisfactory proof, by affidavit, that the sum so fixed
is immfficient in amount, make an order, requiring the appellant to give
a further undertaking, to the same effect, in a sum and within a time, 
specified in the order. A failure to comply with such an order has the 
ea.me effect, 88 if no undertaking had been given, 88 prescribed in this section. 
~ 1328. Uthe appeal is taken from a judgment or order, directing
the 1:1.SSignment or delivery of a document, or of personal property, it

directed to be aeeigned or delivered, is brought into the court below, or 
placed in the custody of an offir..er or receiver, designated by that court;
or the appellant gives a written undertaking 88 prescribed in the next section.

-chattel, it does not ataythe execution of the judgment, until the appel-{~~~t:t

a judge thereof, to the effect that the appellant will obey the direction 
-of the appellate conrt, npon the appeal.
§ 1330. Ihhe appeal is taken from a judgment or order, directing 
the 6%eelltion of a conveyance, or other insteument, it does not stay the

entered, to abide the direction of the appellate court. 
§ 1881. IC the appeal is taken from a judgment, which entitles the
:respondent to the immediate possession of real property, or from ajudg-i~~:;it. 
-ment-Ororder, directing the 88Je or taedelivery of poeseesion of real prop-
erty, it does not stay the execution of the judgment or order, until the 
-appellant gives a written undertaking, to tho effect that he will not,
while in possession of the property, commit, or l!luffer to be committed, 
"'llllY waste thereon; and that; if the judgment or order is affirmed, or
tho appeal is dismissed, be will pay the value of the use and occupation
of the property, or the part thereof, as to which the judgment or order
is affirmed· from the time of taking tho appeal, until the deliveryof the
possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment or order, not exceeding a 
·specified sum, fixed by a judge of the court below. B11t if the judg-
ment directs a foreclosure and eale,of real property mortgaged, an
undertaking. is sufficient to stay t'he execution of the judgment, which
is to the effect that if the judgment is affirmed, or the appeal is dis-
missed, the .appellant will pay any deficiency which may occur upon the
sale, in discharging the sum to pay which the sale is directed, with inter- 
. est, and t.he.coets, and a} l expenses chargeable ~inst the proceeds of the
sale, not exceeding a specified BUm, fixed by a Judge of the court below. 
§ 1832. Where the judgment or order, from which an appeal is taken
to the court of appeals, affirms a judgment or order, to the effect speei- 
tied in either of the last five seetiona, ·the undertaking must be the
same, as if the judament or order, from which the appeal is so taken,
was to the same effect, as the judgment or order so affirmed. 
§ 1338. The last six: secttons do not extend to a case, where it is
specially preseribed by law, that an appeal may he taken, or the exe- 
ention of.a ·judgment or· order appealed from may be stayed, without
eecurity, '01" where the security to be given, far either purpose, is spe- 
·cially regulated by law.
§ 1384. Where two or more undertakings are required to be given. 
88 prescribed in this title' they may be· contained in the same instru-
ment, or in diff'enmt Instrnments at the option of the appellant. Each
nndertaking given as prescribed in this title must be executed by at
least two · snretles, and must 'Specify the residence ·of each surety 
'therein. ,,A copy theTeof with a notiee showing where it is filed, must
be served on the attomey for the adverse party with the notice of ap-
peal or before the expiration of the time of appeal. 
§ 1335. The attomey for the respondent may, within ten days after 
service of a copy of the undertaking, with notice of the fl.ling thereof,
serve upon the attomey for the appellant, a written notice, that he 
excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. Within ten days thereafter,
the sureties, or other sureties in a new undertaking, to the same effect,
must justify, before a judge of the court below, or a county judge. At 
east five days' notice of ihe justification must be given; in every other
respect, the provisions of sections five hundred and seventy-eight, five
hundred and seventy-nine, and five hundred and eighty of this ad 
apply to the justification. If the judge finds the sureties sufficient, be
must indorse his allowance of them, upon the undertaking, or a copy
thereof; and a notice of the allowance must be served upon the attor­
ney for the exceptant. The effect of a failure so to justify, and to pro­
cure an allowance, is the same, as if the undertaking had not been
given. 
§ 1336. Where final judgment is rendered in the court below, aft.er
the affirmance, upon an appeal to the general term of that court, of an
interlocutory judgment; or after the refusal, by the general term, of a 
new trial, either upon an application, made, in the first instance, at the
general term, or upon an appeal from an order of the special term, or 
of the judge before whom the issues, or questions of fact, were tried
by a jury; the party aggrieved may appeal directly from the final
judgment to the court of appeals, notwithstanding that it was rendered
at a special term, or at a trial term, or pursuant to the directions, con­
tained in a referee's report. But such an appeal brings up, for review,
only the determination of the general term, affirming the interlocutory
judgment, or refusing the new trial. 
§ 1837. Adn appealt.to the couf rt. of appeals t~m1  a final jt~dgmenft, or
roman or er, gran mg or re usmg a new na m an ac ion, or rom 
a. final order affecting a substantial right, made, either in a special
proceeding, or upon a summary application after judgment in an action,
brings up for review, in that court, every question, affecting a substan­
tial right, and not resting in discretion, which was determined by the 
general term of the court below, in rendering the judgment or making
the order, from which the appeal is taken; except that a question of
fact, arising upon conflicting evidence, cannot be determined upon such
an appeal, unless where special provision for the determination thereof
is made by law. 
§ 1338. Upon an appeal to the court of apeeals from a. jn4gment,
reversing a judgment entered upon a referees report, or a decision
of the court, upon a trial without a jury; or from an order granting a 
new trial, upon such a reversal; it must be presumed, that the judg­
ment was not reversed, or the new trial granted, upon a question of
fact, unless the contrary clearly appears, in the body of the judgment
or order appealed from. In that case, the court of appeals must review
the determination of the general term of the court below, upon the
questlons of fact, as well as the questions of law. 
§ 1889. Where an appeal to the court of appeals, from a _judgment,
rendered at a general term of the court below, upon a verdict, subject 
to the opinion of the court, has been perfected, a case, containing a
concise statement of the facts, of the questions of law a.rising there­
upon, and of the determination of those questions by the general term
must be prepared and settled, by or under the direction of the court
below, and annexed to the judgment-roll. An exception is not neces-
158.ry, to enable the conrt of appeals to review the determination of a
question of law, arising upon the verdict. A certified copy of the case 
must be transmitted to the court of appeals, instead of the case, upon
which the judgment of the court below was rendered. The court
below, or a judge thereof, may extend the time, limited by law, within
which the papers must be transmitted to the court of appeals, for the
purpose of enabling the appellant to procure the case to be prepared
or settled.

ment of the same amount, or to the same effect.

~ £Je J dgment or order appealed from, and A. written notice of the

 the court below.
§ 1352. Upon an appeal from a final judgment, taken as prescribed 
in this title, the appellant may give the security, required to perfect
an appeal to the court of appeals, from a judgment of the same amount,

scribed in this title, must be heard upon a certified copy of the notice
of appeal, and of the papers used before the court or the judge, upon

entered, and the judgment-roll, or the papers upon which the appeal
was determined, as the case requires, must be ti.led, in the office of the
clerk of the county, where the jnd~ment or order appealed from is
entered. If the appeal is determined at a general term, held in
another county, the clerk of that county must, at the expense of the
successful party, transmit a certified copy of the determination, and
-the other papers, if any, required to be tiled, to the clerk of the county
where the judgment or order is to be entered.

in its discretion, order an execution, issued upon a judgment rendered
age.inst a sheriff, either alone or with another, to be directed to a per­
son, designated in the order, instead of to the coroners, or a particular 
. hi b it t b d" d Tb d .
eoroner ; m w ic case 1 mus e so irecte . e person so esrg- 
nated must be of full ~e, a resident of the State, and not a party to
the action, or interested therein. Where the execution is issued upon
a judgment for a sum of money, or directing the payment of a sum of
money, the order does not take effect, until the person so designated
executes, and files in the clerk's office, a bond to the people, with at
Ieast two sureties, approved by a judge of the court, or a county judge,
in a penal sum, fixed bv the order, not less than twice the sum to be
collected by virtue of the execution; conditioned for the faithful per­
formance of his duties under the execution. A certified copy of the
order, and, where it requires a bond to be given, the clerk's certificate
that a bond has been filed, as required by the order, must be attached 
to the execution. The person so designated is deemed an officer ; and,
with respect to that execution, he is subject to the obligations and
liabilities, and has the power and authority of a coroner, and is entitled 
to fees accordingly. .
§ 1363. The sheriff, to whom an execution is directed and delivered, 
must, upon the receipt thereof, indorse thereupon a memorandum of
the day, hour, and minute, when he received it.

8. For the delivery of the possession of real property, with or with- 
out damages for withholding the same.
4. For the delivery of the possession of a chattel, with or without 
damages for the taking or detention thereof.
An execution is the process of the court, from which it is issued.
§ 1365. An execution against property can be issued only to a county, 
in the clerk's office of which the judgment is docketed. An execution
against the person may be issued to any county, Au execution for the 
delivery of the possession of real property, must be issued to the county,
where the property, or a part thereof, is situated. An execution for
the delivery of the possesslon of a chattel, may be issued to any county,
where the chattel is fouud; or to the sheriff of the county where the 
judgment-roll is filed. Executions, upon the same judgment, may be 
Issued at the same time, to two or more different counties. 
§ 1366. An execution must intelligibly describe the judgment, stat-
ing the names of the parties in whose favor, and against whom, the~~~~':
time wheu, and the court in which, the judgment was rendered; and,
if it was rendered in the supreme court, the county in which the judg­
ment-roll is filed. It must require the sheriff to. return it to the proper
clerk, within sixty days after the receipt thereof. Except as otherwise
prescribed in the next section, it must be made returnable to the clerk,
with whom the judgment-roll is filed. 
§ 1367. Where an execution is issued out of a court, other than that
in which the judgment was rendered, upon filing a transcript of the 
judgment rendered in the latter court, it must also specify the clerk,
witli whom the transcript is filed, and the time of filing ; and it must
be made returnable to that clerk. If the judgment was rendered in a
justice's court, it must specify the justice's name; and it must omit the
specification, respecting the filing of the judgment-roll. 
§ 1368. An execution, issued upon a judgment for a sum of money,
or directing the paymeut of a sum of money, must specify, in the body 
thereof, the sum recovered, or directed to be paid, and the sum actually
due when it is issued. It may specify a day, from which interest upon 
the sum due is to be computed] in which case, the sheriff' must co11ect
interest accordingly, until the sum is paid. If all the parties, against 
whom the judgment is rendered, are not· judgment debtors, the execu­
tion must sho.v who is the judgment debtor. 
§ 1869. An execution against property must, if the judgment-roll is
not filed in the clerk's office of the county to which it is Issued, specify 
the time when the judgment was docketed in that county. It mnst,
except in a case where special provision is otherwise made by law, sub­
stantially require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, out of the personal
property of the judgment debtor; and, if sufficient personal property
cannot be found, out of the real property, belonging to him, at the time
when the judgment was docketed in the clerk's office of the county, or
at any time thereafter. 
§ 1870. Where a warrant of attachment, issued in the action, bas
been levied, by the sheriff, the execution must substantially require the 
sheriff to satisfy the judgment, as follows:
1. Where the judgment debtor is a non-resident, or a foreign corpo- 
ration, and the summons was served upon him or it, without the State,
or otherwise than personally, pursuant to an order obtained for that
purpose, as prescribed in chapter fifth of this act, and the judgment
debtor bas not appeared in the action; out of the personal property
attached, and, if that is insufficient, out of the real property attached. 
2. In any other case, out of the personal property attached ; and, if
that is insufficient, out of the other personal property of the judgment
debtor; if both are insufficient, out of the real property attached ; and,
if that is insufficient, out of the real property, belonging to him, at the
time when the judgment was docketed in the clerk's office of the county,
or at any time thereafter. 
§ 1871. An execution against real or personal property, in the hands
of an executor, administrator, heir, devisee, legatee, tenant of real
property, or trustee, must subst.antially require the sheriff' to satisfy 
the judgment, out of that property.
§ 1372. An execution against the person must substantially require 
the sheriff, to arrest the judgment debtor, and commit him to the jail 
of the county, until he pays the judgment., or is discharged according
to law. Except where it may be issued, without the previous issuing
and return of an execution against property, it must recite the issuing
and return of such an execution, specifying the county to which it was 
issued. 
§ 1378. An execution f'or the delivery of the possession of real prop­
ert.y, or a chattel, must particularly describe the property, and desig­
nate the party to whom the judgment awards the possession thereof; 
and it must substantially require the sheriff', to deliver the possession
of the property, within bis county, to the party entitled thereto. If a 
sum of money is awarded by the same judgment, it may be collected,
by virtue of the same execution; or a separate execution may be Issued
for the collection thereof, omit.ting the direction to deliver poseessioa
of the property. If one execution is issued for both purposes, it must

an execution against property, or against the person, as the case requires
§ 1374. a jt~dgment awteards diffit~rent sumbs ?f mdoney, to or 
agams ineren par ies, a. separa execn 1011 may e issue , to collect
each sum so awarded ; subject to the power of the court, to control the 
enforcement of the executions, upon motion, where the collection of one
execution will, wholly or partly, satisfy another. 
§ 1375. Except as otherwise specially prescribed by law, the party 
· fi I · d t, h · · h .
recovermg a ua JU gmen or 1s assignee, may ave execution there- 
ui,011, of course, at e.uy time within five years after the entry of the
judgment. 
§ 1376. Where the party recovering a final judgment has died, e~e-
entiou may be issued at any time within five years after the entry of 
the judgment, by his personal representatives, or by the assignee of
the judgment, if it has been assigned, and the execution must be in- 
dorsed with the name and residence of the person issuing the same.
§ 1377. After the lapse of five years from the entry of a final judg- 
ment, execution can be issued thereupon, in one of the following cases
only: 
1. Where an execution was issued thereupon within five years after
the entry of the judgment, and has been returned wholly or partly 
unsatisfied or unexecuted.
2. Where an order is made by the court, granting leave to issue the 
execution.
§ 1378. Notice of an application for an order, gra.nt.ing leave to issue 
an execution, as prescribed in the 18.b~· section, must be served person-
ally upon the adverse party, if he is a resident of the State, and 
personal service can, with reasonable diligence, be made upon him
therein; ot.herwise, notice must be given in such manner as the court
directs. Where the judgment is for a sum of money, or directs the
payment of a sum of money, leave shall not be granted, except on
proof, by affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, that the judgment
remains who1ly or partly unsatistled. 
§ 1379. An execution to coJlect a sum of money cannot be issued,
against the property of a judgment debtor, who has died since t.he 
eutry of the judgment, except as prescribed in the next two sections.
§ 1380. After the expiration of one year from the death of a part.y, 
against whom a final judgment for a sum of money, or directing the
payment of a sum of money, is rendered, the judgment may be en- 
forced by execution, against. any propert.y upon which it is a Iien,
with like effect as if the judgment debtor was still living. But such
an execution shall not be issued, unless an order, granting leave to
issue it, is procured from the court, from which the execution is to be 
issued, and a decree, to the same effect, is procured from d. surrogate's
court of the State, which bas duly granted letters testamentary or
letters of administrat.ion, upon the estate of the deceased judgment
debtor. Where the lien of the j11tlgme11t was created as prescribed in section twelve hundred and fifty-one of this act, neither the order nor
the decree can be made until the expiration of three years after letters
testamentary or letters of administration have been duly granted upon
the estate of the decedent; and for that purpose such o. lien, existing
at the decedent's death, continues for throe years and six months
thereafter, notwithstanding the previous expiration of ten years from
the filing of the judgment-roll. 
§ 1881. Leave to issue an execution, as prescribed in the la.st sec- 
tion, must be procured u follows: .
1. Notice of the application, to the court, from which the execution 
is to be issued, for an order, granting leave to issue the execution, must
be given to the person or persons, whose interest in the property will 
be affected by a sale by virtue of the execution, and also to the execu­
tor or administrator or the judgment debtor. The general rules of
practice may prescribe the manner in which the notice must be given ; 
until provision is so made therein, it must be served, either personally, 
or in such manner as the court prescribes, in an order to show cause.
Leave shall not be granted, except upon proof, by affidavit, to the sat­
isfaction of the court, that the judgment remains wholly or partly
unsatisfied. 
2. For the purpose of procuring a decree from the surrogate's court,
granting leave to issue the execution, the judgment creditor must pre­
sent to that court, a written petition, duly verified, setting forth the
facts, and praying for such a decree; and that the persons, specified
in the first subdivision of this section, may be cited, to show cause why
it should not be granted. Upon the presentation of such a petition,
the surrogate must issue a citation accordingly; and, upon the return
thereof, he must make such a decree in the premises, as j ustice req 11 ires. 
§ 1382. The time during which the person, entitled to enfor-ce a
judgment, is stayed from enforcing it, by the provision of a statute, or 
by an injunction or other order, or in consequence of an appeal, is not
a part of the tiine, limited by this title, for issuing' au execution there- 
upon, or for making an application for leave to issue such an executiou. 
§ 1383. The last six sections do not affect the right of a judgment 
~ f'." 
creditor to enforce a judgment, against the property of one or more
surviving judgment debtors, &8 if all the judgment debtors were living. 
In that. case, an execution must be issued iu the usual form; but. the
attorney for the judgmeut creditor must indorse thereupon, a notice to 
the sheriff, reciting the death of the deceased judgment debtor, and
requiring the sheriff not to collect the execution, out of any property
which belonged to him. 
§ 1384. A sale of real or personal property, by virtue of an execu­
tion, or pursuant to t.he directions contained in a judgment. or order,
must be made at. public auction, between the hour of nine o'clock in the 
morning and sunset. 
§ 1885. A person who, before the t.ime fixed for the sale, in a not.ice
or the sale of property, to be made by virtue of an execution, wilfully 
takes down or defaces such a notice put up by the sheriff, or by his
authority, forfeits fifty dollars to the judgment creditor, and the same
sum to the judgment debtor; unless the notice was defaced or takeu
down, with the consent of the person seeking to enforce the forfeiture,
or the execution was previously satisfied. 
§ 1386. Au emission by the sheriff to give notice, as required by law,
or the taking down or defacing of a notice, wheu put up, does not *effect 
the validity of a sale, made by virtue of an execution, to a purchaser
in ¥~ faith, with~n~ notice of the omiss~on ?r o~'ence. 
§ 1387. The shentl, t.o whom au execution us directed, or t.he under­
sheriff or deputy-sheriff', holding an execntion, and conductiug a sale 
of property by virtue thereof, shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase
any of the property at the sale. A pm-chase made by him, or to his
use,~ void. 
§ 1388. Where the sheriff, to whom au execution is delivered, dies,
is removed from office, or becomes otherwise disqualified to act, before
the execution is returned, his under-sheriff must. proceed upon the 
execution, as the sheriff mizht have done. lf there is no under-shentr 
the court, from which the execution issued, may designate a person t~ 
proceed thereupon; who may complete the same, &1 an under-sheriff'
might have done. The person so designated must give such security
as the court directs. He is deemed an officer; and is subject to the 
same obligations and liabilities, and has the same power and authority,
in relation to the object of his appointment, as a sheriff, and is entitled 
to fees accordingly. But this section does not apply, in a case where
special provision is otherwise made by law, for the enforcement of an
execution, after the death, removal from office, or other disqualiflcaticn,
of the sheriff', or under-sheriff. ·

exempted, and stating that it has been set apart for a family or private

money thereof. 
§ 1398. In order to designate property, to be exempted as prescribed

containing a full description of the property, and stating that it is

or proved, and certified. in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the

surviving children, until the majority of the youngest surviving child.
2. If the decedent was a man, it continues, for the benefit of his 
widow and surviving children, until the majority of the youngest snr-
vivh.g child, and until the death of the widow. 
But the exemption ceases earlier, if the property ceases to be occu­
pied, as a residence, by a person for whose beuetit it may so continue,
except as otherwise prescribed in the next section. - · 
§ 1401. The right to exemption, of a person entitled thereto, as pre-
scribed in the last four sections, is not affected by a suspensiou of the

hi b  f   t 
excee ng one year, w ic occurs m consequence o lllJury o, or
destruction of, the dwelling house upon the premises. 
§ 1402. The exemption of a homestead, otherwise valid under the~:!!-::. 
provisions of this article, is not void, because the value of the property,
designated as exempt, exceeds one thousand dollars. In that case, the 
lien of a judgment attaches to the surplus, as if the property bad not
been designated as an exemtp homestead; but the property cannot be
sold by virtue ~n execution, issued upon a judgment, as against which
it is exempt. Wter the return of such an execution, the owner of the
judgment may maintain a judgment creditor's action, to procure a
judgment directing a sale of the property, and enforcing his lien upon
the surplus:) 
§ 1403. "wnere the judgment, in a judgment creditor's action,
brought as prescribed in the last section, or in any other action affect­ 
ing the title to an exempt homestead, directs the sale of the property,
the court must so marshal the proceeds of the sale, that the right and 
interest of each person in the proceeds, shall correspond, as nearly as
may be, to his right and interest in the property sold. Money, not
exceeding one thousand dollars, paid to a judgment debtor, as repre­
senting his interest in the proceeds, is exempt for one year after the
payment, as the property sold was exempt ; unless, before the expira­
tion of the year, he causes real property to be designated as an exempt
homestead, as prescribed in section one thousand three hundred and
ninety-eight of this act ; in which case, the exemption ceases, with
respect to so much of the money, as was not expended for the purchase
of that property ; and the exemption of the property so designated
extends to every debt, against which the property sold was exempt.
Where the exemption of property, sold as prescribed in this section,
bas been continued after the judgment debtor's death, or where be
dies after the sale, and before payment to him of his proportion of the
proceeds of the sale, the court may direct that portion of the proceeds,
which represents his interest, to be invested, for the benefit of the per­ 
son or persons, entitled to the benefit of the exemption; or to be other­
wise disposed of, as justice requires. 
§ 1404. The owner of real property, exempt as prescribed in this article, may, at any time, subscribe a notice, and personally ackuowl­
edge the execution thereof, before au officer, authorized by law to take 
the acknowledgment of a deed, to the effect, that he cancels all exemp-
tions from levy or sale by virtue of an execution, affecting the property,
or a particular part thereof, fully described in the notice. The cancel­
lation takes effect, when such a notice is recorded, as prescribed in this article for recording a notice to effect the exemption so cancelled. .A.uy
other release or waiver, hereafter executed, of an exemption of real 
property, allowed by this article, or of an exemption of a homestead,
or a private or family burying ground, allowed by the provisions of
law heretofore in force, is void. A mortgage, hereafter executed, upon
property so exempt, is ineffectual, until the exemption has been can­
celled, as prescribed in this section ; except that such a mortgage is 
valid, to the extent of the purchase-money of the same property, secured
thereby.

§ 1405. The ~oods and chattels of a judgment debtor, not exempt,
by express provision of law, from levy and sale by virtue of an execu- 
tion, and his other personal property, which is expressly declared by
law, to be subject to levy by virtue of an execution, are, when situated 
within the jurisdiction of the officer, to whom an execution against,
property is delivered, bound by the execution, from the time of the
delivery thereof to the proper officer, to be executed; but not before. 
§ 1406. Where two or more executions against property are issued,
out of the same or different courts of record, against the same judg- 
ment debtor, the one first delivered, to an officer, to be- executed, has
preference, notwithstanding that a levy is flrst made, by virtue of an
execution subsequently delivered; but if a levy upon and sale of per-
sonal property has been made, by virtue of the junior execution, before
an actual levy, by virtue of the senior execution, the same property
shall not be levied upon or sold, by virtue of the letter.* 
§ 1407. Where there are one or more executions, and one or more
warrants of attachment, against the property of the same person, the 
rule prescribed in the last section prevails, in determining the prefer-
ences of the executions or warrants of attachment; the defendant in
the warrants of attachment being, for that purpose, regarded as a judg-
ment debtor. 
§ 1408. But an execution, issued out of a court not of record, or a
warrant of attachment, granted in an action pending in a court not of
record, if actually levied, has preference over another execution, issued
out of any court, of record or not of record, which has not been pre-
viously levied. 
§ 1409. The title to personal property, acquired before the actual
levy of an execution, by a purchaser in good faith, and without notice 
that the execution has been issued, is not affected by an execution de­
livered, before the purchase was made, to an officer, to be executed. 
§ 1410. The officer, to whom an execution agaiust property is de­
livered, must levy upon current money of the United States, belonging 
to the judgment debtor; and must pay it over, as so much money col­
lected, without exposing it for sale ; except that where it consists of 
gold coin, he must sell it, like other personal property; unless he is
otherwise directed, by an order of a Judge, or by the judgment in the 
particular cause.
§ 1411. The officer, to whom an execution against property is deliv­ 
ered, must levy upon and sell, a bill, or other evidence of debt, belong­
ing to the judgment debtor, which was issued by a moneyed corpora-
tion to circulate as money ; or a bond or other instrnmen t for the
payment of money, belonging to the jndgruent debtor, which was
executed and issued, by a government, state, county, public officer, or
municipal or other corporation, and is in terms negotiable, or payable
to the bearer, or bolder. 
§ 1412. The interest of the judgment debtor in personal property,
subject to levy, lawfully pledged, for the payment of money, or the
performance of a contract or agreement, may be sold, in the hands of 
the pledgee, by virtue of an execution against property. The purchaser
at the sale acquires all the right and interest of the judgment debtor,
and is entitled to the possession of the property, on complying with
the terms and condit.ions, upon which the judgment debtor could ob­
tain poeseseion thereof. This section does not apply to property, of
which the judgment debtor is unconditionally entitled to the possession. 
§ 1413. Where an officer has seized personal property of a partner­
ship, before or after its dissolution, upon a levy upon the interest 
therein of a partner, made by virtue of ·an execution against bis indi­
vidual property, the other partners, or former partners, having an 
interest in the property, or any of them, may, at any time before the
sale, apply to a judge of the court, or to the county judge of the county, 
where the seizure was made, upon an affidavit, showing the facts, for
an order, directing the officer to release the property, and to deliver it 
to the applicant. ·
§ 1414. Upon such an application, the applicant must give an under­ 
taking, with at least two sureties, approved by the judge, to the effect,
that he will account to the purchaser, upon the sale to be made by vir­
tue of the execution, of the interest of the judgment debtor in the prop­
erty seized, in like manner as he would be bound to account to an
assignee of such an interest; and that he will pay to the purchaser the
balance, which may be found due upon the accounting, not exceeding
a sum, specified in the undertaking, which must be not less than the
value of the interest of the judgment debtor, in the property seized by 
the sheriff, as fixed by the judge. The provisions of sections six hun­
dred and ninety-five and six hundred and ninety-six of this act apply
to the proceedings, taken as prescribed m this and the last section. 
§ 1415. Where a warrant of attachment has been levied upon the
interest of a defendant, as a partner, in personal property of a partner­ 
ship, and the attachment has been discharged 88 to that interest, as
prescribed in sections six hundred and ninety-three and six hundred 
and ninety-four of this act, a levy, by virtue of an execution against
bis individual property, cannot be made upon his interest in the same 
properly, nnleas the warrant of attachment has been vacated, or an-
nulled. 
§ 1416. Where personal property of o. partnership baa been released,
upon giving an undertaking, as prescribed in the last three sections, if 
the execution, by virtue of which the levy was made, is set aside, or is
satisfied without a sale of t.be interest levied upon, the undert.aking
enures to the benefit of each judgment creditor of the same judgment
debtor, then having an execution in the hands of the same officer, or of
another officer, having authority to levy upon that interest, as if it bad
been given to obtain a release from a seizure, made by virtue of such
an execution. 
§ 1417. Where personal property of a partnership has been so
released, the interest. of the judgment debtor therein may be sold by
the officer; and the purchaser, upon the sale, acquires all that interest,
as if be was an assignee thereof. If the purchase-money exceeds the 
amonnt of all the executions and warrants of attachment, against the
property of the same judgment debtor, of which the officer has notice,
and of the lawful fees and charges thereon, the officer must pay the
surplus into court, for the benefit of the judgment debtor, or other per-
son entitled thereto. 
§ 1418. If personal property, levied npon as the property of the
judgment debtor, is claimed, by or in behalf of another person, as his 
property, the officer may, in his discretion, erupanel a jury to try the
validity of the claim. 
§ 1419. If, by their inqnisition, the jurors find t.bat the property
belongs to the claimant, they must also determine its value. There- 
upon the officer may relinquish the levy, unless the judgment creditor
gives him an undertaking, with at.least two sufficient sureties, to the
effect, that the sureties will indemnify him, to an amount therein speci-
fied, not less than twice the value of the property, as determined by
the jury, and two hundred and fifty dollars iu addition thereto, agaiust
all damages, costs and expenses, in an action to be . brought against
him, by the claimant, his assignee, or other representative, by reason
of the levy npon, detentiou, or sale of any of the property, by virtue
of the execution. If t.he undertaking is given, the officer must detain
the propert.y, as belonging to t.he judgment debt.or. 
§ 1420. If the property ie found to belong to the defendant, the find-
ing does not prejudice the right of the claimant, to bring an action to 
recover the property so levied upon, or damages by reason of the levy,
detention, or sale. 
§ 1421. Where an action to recover a chattel, hereafter levied upon
by virtue of an execution, or a warrant of attachment, or to recover 
f d
. 
damages by reason o a. levy upon, etention, or sale of personal prop-
erty, hereafter made, by virtue of an execution, or a warrant of attach- 
ment, is brought against an officer, or against a person who acted by
. his command, or in his aid, if a bond or written undertaking, indem­ 
nifying the officer against the levy or other act, was given, iu behalf of
the judgment creditor, or the plaintiff in the warrant, before the action
was commenced, the person or persons who gave it, or the survivors, if
one or more are dead, may apply to the court, for an order to substitute
the applicants, as defendants m the action, in place of the officer, or of
the person so acting by his command, or in his aid. 
§ 1422. Notice of the application must be given to the att.omey for
each party to the action. If the defendant has not appeared, notice 
must be given to him personally. If the pleadings do not sufficiently 
show, that the case is one where the order may be granted, the facts,
with respect thereto, must be shown by affidavit, or other competent
proof. The motion papers must, contain a written consent, to be made
a defendant in the action, executed by each person, who executed the
instrument or indemnity, unless proof, by affidavit, is furnished, that
those who do not consent are dead. Each consent must be acknowJ­
edged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded
in the county. 
§ 1423. Upon granting the order, the court may, in its discretion,
require the applicants to furnish additional security to the plaintiff, and
to pay the reasonable expenses of the defendant, necessarily incurred 
before the order is ranted; or it may impose such other terms, for the
security of either o the osigiual parties, as justice requires. 
§ 1424. If the indemnity, given by the applicants, related to a part
only of the property, the court may, in a proper case, direct, that the
action be divided into two actions; that the applicants be substituted 
as defendants in one, without affecting the other; and that the contro­
versy in each action be limited to that part of the property, in respect 
to which it is to be continued. Where such an order is made, a similar
application may be subsequently made, in the action which proceeds
against the original defendant, 
§ 1425. If the officer, or person acting by his command, or in bis aid,
is joined as a defendant, with all the persons entitled to make an appli­ 
cation, they may apply Cor an order to strike out his name, as a def end­
ant. IC he is joined as a defendant, with one or more, but not all of 
them, those who are not made defendants, may apply to be sub-tituted
as defendants in his place. In either case, the application is made in
the same manner, and is subject to the same provisions, a.a if it was
me.de as prescribed in section one thousand four hundred and twenty­
one or this act. 
§ 1426. An order, made as prescribed in the last five sections, does
d 
not affect the merits of the cause of action, or of the efence, except so
Car as it limits the controversy to particular property. But if the sub­
stituted or remaining defendants recover judgment, they are entitled
to single costs only. If the action is discontinued, or the complaint
dismissed, a new action may be brought, as if the former action had
not been brought, 
§ 1427. Where an action is brought, in a case where one or more per­ 
sons are entitled to make an application, for an order of substitution,
as prescribed in section one thousand four hundred and twenty-one of
this act, the officer, to whom the instrument of indemnity was given, 
cannot maintain an action thereupon, against a person entitled to make,
but who has not made, such an application ; unless notice of the com­ 
mencement of the action against the officer, or the person acting by his
command, or in bis aid, is given, before the trial thereof, or at least ten
days before judgment by default is taken therein, either to the attorney
whose name is subscribed to the execution or warrant of attachment,
or, personally, to the judgment creditor, or to the plaintiff' in the 
action in which the warrant of attachment was issued, or to one of the
persons who executed the instrument of indemnity. 
§ 1428. Personal property must be offered for sale, in such lots and
parcels, as are calculated to bring the highest price. Except where 
the officer is expressly authorized, by this article, to sell property not
in his possession, personal property shall not be offered for sale, unless
it is present, and within the view of those attending the sale. 
§ 1429. At least six days' previous notice of the time and place of a.
sale of personal property, by virtue of an execution, must be given, by
posting couspicuously written or printed notices thereof, in at least 
three public places of the town or city, where the sale is made.

unexpired term of the Ieaee, and also or the building or buildings, it 
any, erected thereupon. 
§ 1431. Real property, held by one person, in tmst or for tbt, use of
another, is liable to levy and sale by virtue of an execution, issued
upon a judgment recovered against the person, to whose use it is so 
held, in a case where it is prescribed by law, that, by reason of the
invalidity of the trnst, an estate vests in the beneficiary; but special
provision is not otherwise made by law, for the mode of subjecting it 
to his debts. 
§ 1432. The judgment debtor's equity of redemption, in real prop­
erty mortgaged, shall not be sold by virtue of an execution, issued
upon a jnagment recovered for the mortgage debt, or any part thereof. 
§ 1483. Where an execution against property, is issued upon a jndg­
ment, specified in the last section, to the county where the mortgaged 
property is situated, the attorney, or other person who subscribes it,
must indorse thereupon a direction to the sheriff', not to levy it upon
the mortgaged property, or any part thereof. The· direction must
briefly describe the mortgaged property, and refer to the book and
page, where the mortgage is recorded, If the execution is not col­
lected out of the other property of the judgment debtor, t.he sheriff
must return it wholly or partly nnsatisfied, as the case requires. 
§ 1434. The sheriff' who sells real property, by virt.ue of an execution,
must previously give public notice of the time and place of the sale, as 
follows: 
1. A written or printed notice thereof must be conspicuously fast­
ened up, at least forty-two days before the sale, in three public places,
in the town or city where the sale is to take place, and also in three
public places. in the town or city where the property is situated, if the
sale is to take place in another town or city. 
2. A copy of the notice must be published, at least once in each of
the six weeks, immediately preceding the sale, in a newspaper pub­
lished in the county, if there is one; or, if there is none, in the news­
paper printed at Albany, in which legal notices are required to be
published. 
§ 1435. In each notice, specified in the laat section, the real property 
to be sold must be described with common certainty, by setting forth
the name of the township or tract, and the number of the lot, if there
is any, or by some other appropriate description. The validity of a
sale is not affected by the fact, that the property sold is part only of the
property advertised to be sold. 
§ 1436. A sheriff who sells real property, by virtue of an execution,
without having given notice thereof, as prescribed in the last two sec­
tions, or otherwise than as prescribed in this chapter, forfE1its one thou­
sand dollars to the party injured, in addition to the damages which
the latter sustains thereby. · 
§ 1437. Where real property, offered for sale by virtue of an exeeu­
tion, eonsists of two or more known lots, tracts, or parcels, each lot, 
tract, or parcel must be separately exposed for sale. If a person who
is the owner of, or is entit.led by law to redeem, a distinct parcel of the
property, of any other description, requires that parcel to be exposed
for sale separately, the sheriff' must expose it accordingly. No more
real property shall be exposed for sale, than it appears to be necessary 
to sell, in order to satisfy the execution. 
§ 1438. The sheriff, who ells real property, by virtue of an execn 
tion, must make out, subscribe, and acknowledge before an officer
authorized to take the acknowledgment of a deed, duplicate certificates 
of the sale, containing:
1. The name of each purchaser, and the time when the sale was 
made.
2. A particu1ar description of the property sold,
8. The price bid for each distinct parcel separately sold.
4. The whole consideration money paid.
§ 1489. The sheriff must, within ten days after the sale, file one of 
the duplicate certificates, in the office of the clerk of the county, and
deliver another to the purchaser. If there are two or more purchasers,
a certificate mnst be delivered to each. The clerk must immediately
record the certificate in a book, kept by him for that purpose, and must
index the record, to the name of the judgment debtor. His fees for so
doing must be paid by the sheriff, as part of the expenses of the sale. 
§ 1440. The right and title of the judgment debtor, or of a person
holding under him, or deriving title through him, to real property, sold 
by virtue of an execution, is not divested by the sale, until the expira-
tion of the period, within which it can be redeemed, as prescribed in~~
this article, and the execution of the sheriff's deed. But if the property
is not redeemed, and a deed is executed in pursuance of the sale, the 
grantee in the deed is deemed .to have been vested with the legal
estate, from the time of the sale, for the purpose of maintaining an
action for an injury to the property. 
§ 1441. The person entitled to the possession of real property, so1d
by virtue of an execution, as prescribed in the last section, may, during 
the period therein specified, use and enjoy the same 8.8 follows, without
being chargeable with committing waste: 
1. He ma.y use and enjoy it in like manner, and for the like pur-
poses, as it was used and enjoyed before the sale, doing no permanent 
injury to the freehold.
2. He may make necessary repairs to a building, or other erection 
thereupon. But this subdivision does not permit an alteration in the
form or structure of the building, or other erection. 
3. He may use and improve the land, in the ordinary course of hus­
bandry; but he is not entitled to a crop, growing thereon, at the expi­
ration of the period of redemption. 
4. He may apply any wood or timber on the land to the necessary
reparation of a fence, building, or other erection, which was thereupon 
at the time of the sale.
5. If he actually occupies the land sold, he may take necessary fire­ 
wood therefrom for use in bis household. 
§ 1442. If, at any time during the period allowed for redemption,
the judgment debtor, or any other person in possession of the property
sold, commits, or threatens to commit, or makes preparations for com-
mitting, waste thereupon, the supreme court, or any justice thereof,
within the judicial district, or the county judge of the county, in which
the property, or any part thereof, is situated, may, upon the applica-
1ion of the purchaser, or his assignee, or the agent or attorney of either,
and proof, by affidavit, of the facts, grant, without norice, an order,
restraining the wrong-doer from committing waste upon the property. 
§ 1443. If the person, against whom such an order is granted, com-
mite waste in violation thereof, after the service upon him of the order, 
with a copy of the affidavit upon which it was granted, the court or
judge, upon proof, by affidavit, of the facts, may grant an order, requir- 
ing him to show eauee, at a time and place therein speci.fi.ed, why he
should not be punished for a contempt. 
§ 1444. If, upon the return of the order to show cause, it sat.isfaetorily
appears, that the person, required to show cause, has violated the
former order, the court or judge may either punish him, as prescribed
by law for the punishment of a contempt of a court of record, other
than a criminal contempt; or may grant a warrant, directed to the
sheriff of the county, reciting the former order, and the violation
thereof, and commanding the sheriff to commit the wro11g doer to close
eontlnement, for a term specified therein, not more than one year. A
person thus committed cannot be admitted to the liberties of the jail. 
§ 1445. The warrant may he superseded, and the prisoner dis­ 
charged, by an order, in the discretion of the court or judge commit­
ting him, upon his executing, to the person who applied for the warrant,
an undertaking, in a sum fixed, and with sureties approved, by the
court or judge, to the effect, that he will pay any judgment, which the
applicent, or his assignee, or other representative, may recover agaiust
him, by reason of any waste theretofore or thereafter committed 011 the
property ; and upon his paying to the applicant, for the costs and
expenses of the proceedings, a sum, fixed by the court or judge. 
§ 1446. Within one year after the sale of real property, by virtue of
an execution, a person, specified iQ. the next section, ruay redeem it, 
by paying to the purchaser, his executor, administrator, or assignee,
or to the sheriff who made the sale, for the use of the person so entitled 
thereto, the sum of money which was paid upon the sale, with interest
from the time of the sale, at the rate of ten per centum a year. 
§ 1447. The redemption, specified in the last section, may be made,

his heir, devisee or grantee, who bas acquired, by inheritance, devise,
deed, sale, by virtue of a mortgage or of an execution, or by any other
means, an absolute title to the property proposed to be redeemed; or,
in a case specified in section one thousand four hundred and fifty-eight
or one thousand four hundred and fifty-nine of this act, to a portion
thereof. 
§ 1448. Upon payment being made, by a person entitled to redeem
real property, 8.8 prescribed in the last two· sections, the sale of the 
property redeemed, and the certificates of the sale, as far as they relate
thereto, become null and void. 
§ 1449. Real property, sold by virtue of an execution, which remains,
at the expiration of one year after the sale, unredeemed by the person 
or persons entitled to redeem it, 8.8 prescribed in the last three sections,
may be redeemed, within three months after the expiration of the year, 
by the creditors specified, and upon the terms and in the manner pre­
scribed, in the following sections of this article. 
§ 1450. In a. ease specified tin thed IB;st. stecttoion, a c~ditor,thaving in
ms own name, or as execu or, a nnms ra r, assignee, rustee, or 
otherwise, a judgment rendered, or a mortgage duly recorded, at any
time before the expiration of fifteen months from the time of the sale, 
w'llich is a lien upon the real property sold, may redeem that property,
by paying the sum of money, which was paid upon the sale thereof,
with interest at the rate of seven per centum a year from the time or 
the sale, and executing a. certificate of satisfaction, as prescribed in section one thousand four hundred and sixty-three of this act. 
§ 1451. Where a creditor bas redeemed real property, as prescribed
in the l88t section, any other creditor, who might have redeemed it 
from the purchaser, as therein prescribed, may redeem it from the flret
redeeming creditor, as follows : 
1. He must reimburse to the first redeeming creditor, his executor,
administrator, or assignee, the sum paid by him to redeem the prop- 
erty, with interest at the rate of seven per centum a year, from the
time of his redemption. 
2. He must execute a certifleate or satisfaction, relating to bis judg­
ment or mortgage, in like manner as the first redeeming creditor was
req uired to do. 
3. If the judgment or mortgage, by virtue of which the first creditor

the second creditor must also pay to the fim creditor, the sum specified
in the certificate of satisfaction, executed by him upo1.1 his redemption,
with interest at the rate of seven per ceutmn a year, from the time of
his redemption; unless the first redeeming creditor's judgment or
mortgage bad ceased, when be redeemed, to be a lien as against the
second redeeming creditor; in which case, the latter need not pay any 
part of the sum, specified in the certificate.
§ 1452. Where the lien of the second redeeming creditor's judgment 
or mortgage, is prior to that of the first redeeming creditor's judgment
or mortgage, so that the former redeems, without paying the sum, 
specified in the latter's certificate of satisfaction, the latter may, with-
out executing auother certificate of satisfaction, again redeem from the
former, or from any subsequent redeeming creditor, in a case, where
he would have been entitled to redeem, if bis first certificate bad not
been executed; and he has the same rights, with respect to any cred-
itor redeeming from him, as if his first certificate had been executed,
wheu he made his second redemption. 
§ 1453. A third or other creditor, who might have redeemed, as pre-

sheriff's office. If the term of office of the sheriff, who made the sale,
bas expired, and he, or his under-sheriff, or a deputy-sheriff' author-
ized, iu his behalf, to receive the necessary money and the necessary
papers, is not present, the money may be paid, and the papers may be 
delivered, to the sheriff then iu office, or to the under-sheriff' or a.
deputy-sheriff of the latter. 
§ 1456. If the purchaser, at the execution sale, of property, which

chaser, or a redeeming creditor, be may avail himself of his judgment
or mortgage, to redeem from any other redeeming creditor. 
§ 1457. The judgment creditor, by virtue of whose execution real

redeem again. But if either has another judgment or mortgage, which 
would entitle him to redeem, be may avail himself thereof for that
purpose, in the same manner and on the same terms, as a.ny other
creditor. 
§ 1458. Where a person, who bas an absolute title to, or a judgment
or mortgage, which is a lien upon, a distinct parcel only of the real
property, sold byvirtue of an execution, would be authorized, by this article, to redeem the property, if his title or lien extended to the
whole, he may redeem, from a purchaser, the entire property sold, or
from a prior redeeming creditor, the entire property redeemed by that 
creditor ; except that if his title or lien extends to a distinct parcel
only of one or more parts of the property, which were separately sold,
he can redeem, from a purchaser, only the part or parts thus separately
sold, in which his distiuct parcel is included. 
§ 1459. Where two or more persons own undivided shares, as joint
tenants, or as tenants in common, in real property, sold by virtue of an 
execution, or in a distinct parcel thereof, which has been separately
sold; each of them may redeem, from the purchaser, as prescribed in sections one t.kousand four hundred and forty-six and one thousand
four hundred and forty-seven of this act, the share or interest, belong­
ing to him, by payiug a part of the purchase money, bid for the prop­
erty, or for that distinct parcel thereof, bearing the same proportion to 
the whole, as the share or interest, proposed to be redeemed, bears to 
the property, or distinct parcel separately sold, of which it is a part ;
together with interest on the sum so paid, from the time of the sale, at
the rate of ten per ceutum a year. 
§ 1460. Where the judgment or mortgage of a creditor, entitled to 
redeem, is a lien upon an undivided share, specified in the last section,
he may redeem, from a purchaser, that undivided share, by paying
him the same proportion of the purchase money, which the owner
must have paid to redeem it, as prescribed in the last section ; or be
may redeem, from a prior redeeming creditor, the eutire property re­
deemed by the latter, with like effect and in the same manner, as if 
bis lien attached to the whole.
§ 1461. The sheriff, the purchaser, the judgment creditor or a redeem­ 
ing creditor, cannot, by bis agreement or other act, in auy mauner
impair or prejudice the right of any other person to redeem, as pre- 
scribed in this article. ·
§ 1462. The money required to be paid by a creditor, in order to 
effect a redemption of real property, as prescribed in this article, may
be paid to the purchaser or credit.or, from whom the property is to be
redeemed, his executor, administrator or assignee; or it may be paid,
for the use of the person so entitled thereto, to the sheriff who made 
the sale.
§ 1463. The certificate of satisfaction, required to be executed by a 
creditor, in order to effect a redemption of real property, must be 
acknow ledged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be 
recorded in the county; must describe, with reasonable certainty, the 
judgment or mortgage under which he redeems, and specify the sum
duo thereupon; and must state, that the redemption satisfies the judg-
ment or mortgage, in full, or to a specified amount. It must be filed
in the county clerk's office, at or before the time when the money is
11aid to effect the redemption, unless the money is paid to the sheriff"; 
iu which case, the certificate must also be delivered, at the time of the
payment, to the sheriff', who must file it in the county clerk's office, as
prescribed in section one thousand four hundred and sixty seven of this 
act. 
The county clerk, immediately after the execution and recording of
the deed, must enter in his docket, the satisfaction, or partial satisfac­
tion, of a judgment specified in a certificate so filed, as required by
law, when a judgment is collected, by virtue of an execution. If a.
mortgage, specified in the certificate, is recorded in his office, he must 
.eaneel and discharge the mortgage of record, if it is satisfied by the
certificate; or, if it is only partially satisfied, he must make a minute 
of the partial satisfaction, upon the record thereof. If the property
moetgaged is situated in a county, in which there is a register, the
county clerk must trausmit a certified copy of the certificate to the
register, who must, in like manner, cancel and discharge the mortgage
of record, or make a minute of the partial satisfaction thereof. The
clerk's and register's fees, for performing the services specified in this section, must be paid by the sheriff; who may require the person
entitled to a deed to pay him the amount thereof, before the deed is
delivered. 
§ 1464. In order to entitle a creditor by judgment to redeem real
property, as prescribed in this article, he must, when he redeems, file
in the county clerk's office, or deliver to the sheriff, as the case requires, 
the following evidence of his right:
1. A copy of the docket of the judgment, under which he claims the 
right to redeem, duly certified by the county clerk.
2. Each assignment of the judgment, which is necessary to establish 
bis right. An assignment so filed or delivered must be acknowledged
or proved, and certified, in like manner as a. deed to be recorded, or
the execution thereof must be proved, by the affidavit of the creditor,
or of a witness thereto; unless it has been filed, and entered, as pre­
scribed in article third of title first of chapter eleventh of this act, in
which case, a certified copy thereof must be filed or delivered. 
3. An affidavit, made by him, or his attorney or agent, stating truly
the sum remaining unpaid on the judgment, at the time of claiming
the right to redeem. 
§ 1465. In order to entitle a creditor by mortgage to redeem real
property, as prescribed in this article, he must, when he redeems, file 
m the county clerk's office, or deliver to the sheriff', the following evi-
dence of his right: 
1. A copy of the mortgage, under which he claims the right to
redeem, duly certified by the clerk or register of the county. 
2. Each assignment of the mortgage, which is necessary to establish
bis right, acknowledged or proved, and certified, as prescribed in the
last section for an assignment of a. judgment, unless it has been
recorded; in which case a. certified copy of the record must be filed or
delivered. 
8. An affidavit, made by him, or by his attorney or agent, stating truly
the sum remaining unpaid on the mortgage, at the time of claiming the 
right to redeem, 
§ 1466. In either of the cases specified in the last two sectlons, if
the person, proposing to redeem, claims to be entitled so to do, by
reason of his being an executor or adminlstrator of a person, who, if 
living, would be entitled to redeem, he must file or deliver, with the
ot.her papers therein prescribed, a certified copy or a sworn copy of his
letters testamentary, or letters of administration. 
§ 1467. The sheriff to whom one or more faRper-s, specified in the
last four sections, are delivered, must keep them open, at all reasonable
times during the period allowed for redemption, to the inspection of all
persons interested. He must have all those papers at 'the sheriff's 
office, at the times when he is required to attend thereat, for the purpose
of enabling creditors to redeem, as prescribed by law; and he must
file them m the county clerk's office, within three days after the exe­
cution of the deed. 
§ 1468. A redemption by a creditor is effected, only when he bas
paid all the money required to be paid, and filed or delivered all the 
pavers, required to be filed or delivered, as prescribed in this article;
and a waiver of any of those requirements is void, as against a person
who is entitled subsequently to redeem. Where a redemption is thus
effected, it vests in the redeeming creditor all the right, title, and
interest, which the purchaser acquired by the sale. 
§ 1469. Where a redemption is made, as prescribed in this article,
the officer or other person, to whom money is paid, or a paper is 
delivered, for the purpose of effecting the redemption, must execute
and deliver, to the person paying the money or delivering the paper, a 
certiflcate, stating all the facts which transpired before him, with respect
to the redemption. 
§ 1470. Sncb a certificate may be acknowledged or proved, and eer­ 
tilled, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the county where the
property is situated. The recording thereof, in the office of the clerk 
or register of that county, in the book for recording deeds, bas the
same effect, as against subsequent purchasers and iucumbrancers, as
the recording of a conveyance. 
§ 1471. Immediately after the expiration of fifteen mouths from the
time of sale ; except where a redemption has been made on the last 
day of the fifteen months, and, in that case, immediately after the
expiration of twenty-four hours from the last redemption ; the sheriff', 
who made the sale, must execute the proper deed or deeds, in order to 
convey to the person or persons entitled thereto, the part or parts of the
property sold, which have not been redeemed by the judgment debtor,
bis heir, devisee, or assignee. The deed conveys to the grantee therein
the right, tit.le, and interest, which were sold by the sheriff. 
§ 1472. If any part of the property remains unredeemed by a cred­ 
itor, it must be conveyed, by the sheriff, to the purchaser upon the 
sale, except where the certificate of sale bas been assigned; in which
case, it must be conveyed to the last assignee. Any part or parts of
the property sold, which have been rendered* by a creditor, must b$ 
conveyed by the sheriff, to the last redeeming creditor, except where
he has assigned the certificate of redemption, or has executed any
other assignment of his right, title, and interest in the property
redeemed by him; in which case, it must be conveyed to the last
assignee. 
§ 1473. Where a person, entitled to a deed, dies before the delivery 
or the deed, the sheriff must. execute and deliver the deed to his
executor or administrator. The property so conveyed must be held, in 
trust for the use of the heirs or devisees of the decedent, subject to the
dower of his widow, if there is one; but it may be sold, i11 a proper
case, for the payment of his debts, in the same manner as land, whereof
he died seized. 
§ 1474. Before an assignee, or his executor or administrator, is 
entitled to a deed, as prescribed in the last two sections, each assign- 
ment, under which the deed is claimed, must be acknowledgod or
proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the
county where the property is situated, and must be filed in the office
of the clerk of that county. 
§ 1475. Where a sheriff dies, is removed from office, or becomes
otherwise disqualified to act, at any time after making a sale of real 
property, bJ virtue of an execution, the property, or a distinct parcel
thereof, may be redeemed, by paying the necessary money, and 
delivering the necessary papers, to his under-sheriff, who must also
execute and deliver the proper deed or deeds of property, not redeemed
by the judgment debtor, his heir, devisee, or grantee. If the under-
sheriff also dies, is removed from offire, or becomes otherwise disquali-
fied to act, the property may be redeemed, by paying the necessary
money, and delivering the necessary papers, to the sheriff's successor
in office, who must also execute and deliver the proper deed or deeds.
The under-sheriff or the sheriff's euccessor, as the case requires, pos-
sesses all the powers, and is subject to all the duties and liabilities,
of the sheriff who made the sale, touching the redemption and con-
veyance of property sold, and the proceediugs relating thereto : and
each provision of law, regulating those proceedings, aud applicable
to the sheriff who made the sale, is applicable to his under-sheriff or
successor. This section applies where a sale was made, either before
or after this act takes effect. 
§ 1476. Where real property is sold, by virtue of an execution, by
the under-sheriff or a deputy-sheriff, in behalf of the sheriff, money 
required to be paid, or a paper required to be delivered, to t.he sherlff,
in order to effect a redemption, as prescribed in this article, at any
time before the last day of the fifteen months from the time oft.he sale,
may be paid or delivered, either to the sheriff, or to the under-sheriff
or deputy-sheriff, who made the sale. 
§ 1477. Where real property is sold, by virtue of an execution, by a
person specially apnointed by the court, as prescribed in section one 
thousand three hundred and sixty-two or section one thousand three
hundred and eighty-eight of this act, it may be redeemed, as pre-
scribed in this article, as if it had been sold by the sheriff', except as 
follows : 
1. Money, required to be paid, or a paper, required to be delivered, 
to t.he sheriff, in order to effect a redemption, as prescribed in this article, at any time before the last day of the fifteen months from the
time of the sale, must be paid t.o the officer who made the sale ; unless
the person entitled to redeem, his agent or attorney, files wit.b the
clerk of the county, with the paper or papers required to he tiled, or to
be delivered to the sheriff, for the purpose of effecting the redemption,
his affidavit, to the effect, that the officer is dead ; or has been removed;
or, where he is a coroner, that he is no longer in office ; or that aft.er
diligent search, the affiant has been unable to find him within t.he
county; in which ease, the money may be paid Into court, by paying 
it to the county treasurer, to the credit of the cause, with like effect,
as where it is paid to the sheriff, after a sale by the latter. 
2. The provisions of section one thousand four hundred and fifty-five
of this act, apply to a redemption, upon a sale made as prescribed in
this.section; and the officer, who sold the property, must atteud, ·as the
sheriff is therein required to attend. If he is not preseut, the redemp­
tion may be effected, as prescribed in that section, for redemption in a
case, where the term of office of the sheriff, who made the sale, has 
ex~ired.
§ 1478. If, when the period for redem~tion expires, a coroner, or a 
,  
person specially appointed by the court, w o has sold real property, by 
virtue of an execution, is dead, or has been removed, or, in the case of
a coroner, if he is no longer in office, the court must, upon the applica­ 
tion of a person entitled to a deed, appoint a person, to execute the
deed accordingly.

§ 1479. The purchaser of real property, sold by virtue of an execu­
tion, his heir, devisee, grantee, or assignee, who is evicted from the
possession thereof, or against whom judgment is rendered, in an action
to recover the same, may recover the purchase-money, with interest,
from the person for whose benefit the property was sold, where the
judgment was rendered, or the eviction occurred, in consequence, 
either:
1. Of any irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale; or
2. Of the judgment, upon which the execution was issued being 
vacated or reversed, or set aside for irregularity, or error in fact. 
§ 1480. Where final judgment is rendered, against the defendaet,
in an action specified in subdivision first of the last section, the judg­
ment, by virtue of which the sale was made, remains, in his favor, valid
and effectual against the judgment debtor therein, his executor, admin­
istrator, heir or devisee, for the purpose of collecting the sum paid on
the sale, with interest. He may accordingly have a further execution
upon that judgment; but the execution does uot affect a purchaser in
good faith, or an incumbrancer by mortgage, judgment, or otherwise, 
whose title or whose incumbrance accrued, bef'~l'e the actual levy 
thereof.
§ 1481. Where the real property of two or more persons is liable to 
satisfy a judgment, and the whole of the judgment, or more than a due
proportion thereof, has been collected, by a sale of the real property of
one or more of them, by virtue of an execution issued upon the judg·
ment; the person so aggrieved, or hi.ts executor or administrator, may 
maintain an action, to compel a just and equal contribution by all the
persons, whose real property ought to contribute as prescribed in the 
next section but one.
§ 1482. Where the heir, devisee, or grantee, of a judgment debtor, 
having an absolute ti_tle to a distinct parcel of real property, sold by
virtue of an execution, redeems, as prescribed in section one thousand
four hundred and fifty-eight of thie act, the property sold, or any part
or parts thereof separately sold, which include his property; he may,
in like manner, maintain an action, to compel a just and equal contri-
bution by those, who own the residue of the property thus redeemed. 
§ 1483. Where an action is brought, as prescribed in the last two sections, the real property is liable to contribution in the following 
order:
1. If it comprises different undivided shares or distinct parcels, 
which have been conveyed by the judgment debtor, they are liable in
succession, commencing with the portion last conveyed. 
2. If it comprises different undivided shares or distinct parcels,
which have been sold by virtue of two or more executions, they are
liable in succession, commencing with the portion sold under the last
and youngest judgment. 
3. If it comprises different undivided shares or distinct parcels, some
of which have been conveyed by the judgment debtor, and some of
which have been sold by virtue of one or more executions, they are
respectively liable in succession, according to the order prescribed in
the first and second subdivisions of this section. 
§ 1484. For the purpose of enforcing contribution, as prescribed in
the last section, the court, in which the action is brought, may, and in 
a proper case, must, permit the plaintiff to use the orir'nal judgment,
and to collect, by an execution issued thereupon, out o any real prop-
erty subject to the lien thereof, the sum which ought to be contributed
by that, property. For that purpose, the lien of the original judgment,
upon that real property, when preserved, as prescribed in the next sec-
tion, continues, for the term prescribed in sections one thousand two
hundred and fifty-oue and one thousand two hundred and fifty-five of
this act, to the extent of the sum, which ought to be so contributed,
notwithstanding the payment made by the party seeking contribution. 
§ 1485. The lien of the original judgment may be preserved, as pre-
scribed in the last section, by filing, in the clerk's office of the county
where the real property is situated, within twenty days after thefay-
meut, for which contribution is claimed, an affidavit, in behalf o the
person aggrieved, stating the sum paid, and bis claim to use the judg-
ment for the reimbursement thereof, with a notice, requiring the clerk
to make the entries specified in the next section. But the lien is not
preserved, as ~ainst a grantee or mortgagee in good faith, for a. valu-
able consideration, without notice, and before the entries are actually
made. 
§ 1486. On filing the affidavit and notice, the clerk must make, upon
the docket of the judgment, an entry, stating the sum paid, and that 
the judgment is claimed to be a lieu to that amount. Where it is
desired to preserve the lien, upon property situated in two or more
counties, a similar affidavit and notice must be filed with, and a similar 
6ntry made by, the clerk of each county.
