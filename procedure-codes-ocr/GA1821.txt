made returnable ; and such court shall cause an issue to be joined between the plaintiff
and such claimant, and the right of property to be decided on by a jury at the same

sheriff or constable serving such attachment,) with security in a sum equal to the amount

appear that such claim was made for the purpose of delay. And every juror on the
trial of such claim shall be sworn, in addition to the oath usually administered, to give
such damages as may seem reasonable and just to the plaintiff against the claimant, in
case it shall be sufficiently shown that such claim was intended for the purpose of delay
only : and it shall be lawful for the plaintiff to enter up judgment, and have execution

bonds, or other evidences of debt belonging to the absent debtor, the same shall be
forthwith deposited with the clerk of the court in which the attachment is pending, sub
ject to the order of said court; and after the plaintiff shall have established his demand
against the absent debtor, the court may in its discretion direct the clerk to deliver to
the plaintiff in such attachment, his agent or attorney, such note or notes, bond or
bonds, or other evidence of debt, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to discharge
the amount of the demand, which the plaintiff shall have established against the defen
dant, taking a receipt therefor, which receipt shall be filed with the papers appertaining
to such attachment, and shall be considered as a payment to that amount, unless the
plaintiff shall make it appear that after due diligence used by him he was 'col
lect the amount; and where the evidence so deposited is of a debt greater than the
plaintiff's demand, and will not admit of division, the court shall order the same to be
sued for, in such manner as will, in their discretion, best ensure recovery; and the mo

tachment shall be issued within fifteen days of the next court, such attachment shall be
returnable to the succeeding court, and shall be tried as heretofore directed. And all
goods and chattels, lands and tenements attached, shall be repleviable by the defendant's
giving bond, with good and sufficient security, to the officer levying the same, which
bond he is hereby empowered to take, compelling the defendant to appear at the court
to which such attachment may be made returnable, and to abide by and perform the
order of such court : Provided nevertheless, that all goods and effects attached and not
replevied agreeable to the provisions of this act, where the same shall be of a perisha
ble nature,
the
said
justice
or justices
of the peace
shall,
on motion
of the plaintiff,

Provided
nevertheless,
that
all sales
of
perishable
property
under
attach
ment,
shall
undergo
the same
formalities
of other
constables'
sales
under
executions;
and whenever
any
attachment
shall
be
returned
served
in
the
hands
of a third
person,
it shall
be lawful,
on his or her
appearance
and examination,
in the manner
herein
after
directed,
to
enter
up judgment
as
against
the original
debtor,
and
award
execution
for
the
money
due by
him
or her to the absent
debtor,
and against
such
property
or effects
as may
be in his or her hands
or keeping,
belonging
to such
absent
debtor,
or so much
thereof
as
will be of value
sufficient
to satisfy
the judgment
or
judgments
and costs.
And
all such
goods
and chattels,
levied
on as aforesaid,
and not replevied,
shall,
after
the
plaintiff
has
established
his demand,
be, by order
of
the court,
sold
and
disposed
of, for and
towards
satisfying
the plaintiff’s
judgment,
in like manner
as if the same
had been
taken
under
execution;
and where
the property
so
attached
and sold
as aforesaid,
should
prove
in
sufficient
to
satisfy
the debt
and costs,
or where
the same
shall
be of the nature
of
real
estate,
then,
and in that case,
it shall
be the duty
of said
justice
to issue
execution
or
executions
for
the
amount
of said
judgment
and cost,
or
so
much
thereof
as
remains
unsatisfied.
And

any person,
as garnishee,
returns
debts
due to the absent
debtor,
the court
shall

the same
to be
sued
for, and when
recovered

Sec. 10. Whereas, the said judiciary was intended for the purpose of bringing parties
litigant to a speedy judicial decision without delay, and with as little costs as practi

riffs, not affecting the real merits of the case, should in all cases (substantially set out)
be amended on motion, without delay or costs, and it having grown into practice in
said courts, to give or grant a term, and sometimes nonsuit, for the smallest omis
sions of the officers of said courts; and as a further increase of the said practice may

action, plainly and distinctly set forth in the petition, and there is in substance a

tried upon the petition, process and answer alone, without regard to the practice now
grown into use in the several courts of law in this state; and no nonsuit shall be
awarded when the cause of action is substantially set forth in the declaration, for any
formal variance between the allegation and proof.
-
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That no part of an answer shall be stricken out
or rejected on account of being contradictory to another part of the same answer, but
the court shall be bound to suffer the whole answer to remain, if the defendant should
desire it, and avail himself of any advantage he can or may have under either or the
whole of the said answer, and proceed to trial accordingly.
Sec. 10. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the state of Georgia,

secure the payment of their proportionable part to the obligee, or to the complaining
obligors : for remedy whereof,

defendant, until he secures to the complainant the payment of the demand, or show good
cause to the court why he should not pay the same ; all other proceedings to be in the
same way as is practised under this writ in other cases.
