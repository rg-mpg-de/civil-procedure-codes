86. Conditions precedent, how pleaded. 93. What is a material allegation.

87. Private statute, how pleaded.

SEC. 79. Every pleading shall be subscribed by the party or his
attorney, and, except a demurrer, shall also be verified by the party,
his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true. The
verification must be made by the affidavit of the party, or, if there be

several parties united in interest and pleading together, by one at least
of such parties, if such party be within the county and capable of
making the afiidavit ; otherwise the aflidavit may be made by the
agent or attorney of the party. The affidavit may also be made by the
agent or attorney, if _ the action or defence be founded on a written
instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument be
in the possession of the agent or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent
or attorney. \Vhen the affidavit is made by the agent or attorney, it
must set forth the reason of his making it. \Vhen a corporation is a
party, the verification may be made by any oflicer thereof, upon whom
service of a summons might be made, and when the state or any oilicer
thereof in its behalf is a party, the verification maybe made by any
person to whom all the material allegations of the pleading are known.

SEC. 80. When in the judgment of the‘ court, an answer to an
allegation in any pleading, might subject the party answering to a
prosecution for felony, the verification of the answer to such allegation
may be omitted.

SEC. 81. The answer or demurrer to the complaint, shall be filed
with the clerk by the time required to answer, and thereafter each
pleading shall be filed in like manner, within one day from the filing
of the pleading to which it is a reply or demurrer. A motion to strike
out a pleading for want of verification or subscription, or because
several causes of action, or defence therein are not pleaded separately,
or for other cause, or a sham,‘ frivolous or irrelevant pleading, or
irrelevant or redundant matter therein, shall be made within the time

prescribed for answering such pleading.

SEC. 82. A party may set forth in a pleading the items of an
account therein alleged, or file a copy thereof with the pleading,
verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, if within the
personal knowledge of such agent or attorney, to the effect that he
believes it to be true. If he do neither, he shall deliver to the adverse
party, within five days after a demand thereof in writing, a copy of the
account, verified as in this section provided, or be precluded from
giving evidence thereof. The court or judge thereof may order a
further account when the one filed or delivered is defective.

SEC. 83. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose, of
determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with
a view of substantial justice between the parties.

SEC. 84. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of the adverse party; and when
the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or uncertain that the
precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the court may
require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment.

SEC. 85. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court
or oiiicer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may
be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation be
controvcrted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the

trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.

SEC. 86. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such
performance, but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial
the facts showing such performance.

SEC. 87. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom,
it shall be suflicient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of
its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

SEC. 88. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing
the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which
the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufiicient to state generally
that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and
if such allegation be eontroverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to
establish on trial that it was so published or spoken.

SEC. 89. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount
of damages; and Whether he prove the justincation or not, he may
give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

Sec. 90. In an action to recover the possession of property, distrained doing damage, an answer that the defendant or person by
whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property
upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained
was at the time doing damage thereon, shall be good, without setting

forth the title to such real property.

SEC. 91. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the

same complaint when they all arise out of
1. Contract, express or implied; or,
2. Injuries, with or without force, to the person ; or,
3. Injuries, with or without force, to property; or,
4. Injuries to character; or,
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for
the withholding thereof; or,
6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damage
for the withholding thereof; or,
7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation of law.
But the cause of action so united, must all belong to one only of
these classes, and must affect all the parties to the action, and not
require different places of trial, and must be separately stated.

SEC. 92. Every material allegation of the complaint, not speeificall y
controverted by the answer, and every material allegation of new
matter in the answer, not specilieally controverted by the reply, shall,
for the purpose of the action, be taken as true; but the allegation of
new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse
party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require.

SEC. 93. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the
claim or defence, and which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient.

SEC. 94 No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the

proof shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the
adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defence
upon the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged that a. party has been
so misled, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and
in what respect he has been misled: and thereupon the court may
order the pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just.
SEC. 95. When the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the
evidence, or may order an immediate amendment, without costs.

SEC. 96. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action or
defence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall
not be deemed a case of variance within the two last sections, but a
failure of proof.

SEC. 97. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of
course, without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings already
had, at any time before the period for answering it shall expire; in
such case, a copy of the amended pleading shall be served on the
adverse party before the expiration of said period.

SEC. 98. After the decision upon a demurrer, if it. be overruled,
and it appears that such demurrer was interposed in good faith, the
court may in its discretion allow the party to plead over upon such
terms as may be proper. If the demurrer be sustained, the court. may
in its discretion, allow the party to amend the pleading demurred to,
upon such terms as may be proper.

SEC. 99. The court may at any time before trial, in furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, allow any pleading or
proceeding to be amended, by adding the name of a party, or other
allegation material to the cause, and in like manner and for like
reasons, it may at any time before the cause is submitted, allow such
pleading or proceeding to be amended, by striking out the name of
any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a 1nistake in any other respect, or when the amendment does not substantially change the cause of action or defence, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved.

SEC. 100. The court mav likewise i11 its discretion, and 11 ion such

terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other

act to be done after the time limited by this code, or by an order

enlarge such time; and may also, in its discretion, and upon such
termsas may be just, at anytime within one year after notice thereof,
relieve a party from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken
against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.

SEC. 101. When the plaintiff‘ shall be ignorant of the name of a
defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name; and when his true name shall be discovered,
the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

SEC. 102. When any pleading or proceeding is amended before
trial, mere clerical errors excepted, it shall be done by filing a new
pleading, to be called the amended complaint or otherwise, as the
case may be. Such amended pleading shall be complete in itself,
without reference to the original or any preceding amended one.

SEC. 103. Any pleading not duly verified and subscribed may, on
motion of the adverse party, be stricken out of the case. VVhen any
pleading contains more than one cause of action or defence, if the
same be not pleaded separately, such pleading may, on motion of the
adverse party be stricken out of the case. VVhen ,a motion to strike
out is allowed, the court may upon sucl1 terms as may be proper,
allow the party to file an amended pleading, or, if the motion be
disallowed, and it appear to have been made in good faith, the court
may upon like terms allow the party to plead over.

SEC. 104. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard
any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not
affect the substantial rights of the adverse party.

SEC. 105. The plaintiff and defendant respectively, may be allowed
on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer, or reply,
alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint,
answer, or reply.

employment as such, or by any factor, agent, broker, or other person
in a fiduciary capacity, or for any misconduct or neglect in office, or in
a professional employment.

3. In an action to recover the possession of personal property
unjustly detained, when the property or any part thereof has been concealed, removed, or disposed of, so that it cannot be found or taken by

defendant for any of the causes specified in section 106, shall be as
provided in this section.

1. At any time after the commencement of an action at law, and
before judgment, an order, allowing a Writ of arrest to issue therein,
may be made by any circuit court, county court, or judge thereof of
the state, when it shall appear to such court or judge, by the aflidavit
of the plaintiff or other person, that a sufficient cause of action exists,
and that the case is one of those mentioned in section 106.

2. The affidavit may be either positive, or upon informationeand
belief, but if the latter, it shall state the nature and sources of the
information upon which the belief is founded. The order shall prescribe the amount of the bail, the amount of the undertaking of the
plaintiff, and whether the latter shall be given with or without sureties.
The amount of the undertaking shall not be less than one hundred
dollars, and shall be equal to the amount for Which the plaintiff
demands judgment.

_ 3. Upon hling the order and afiidavit with the clerk of the. court
where the action is pending, the plaintiff shall be entitled to have the
writ issue, as soon thereafter as he shall file with the clerk his undertaking in conformity with the provisions of the order, and to the effect,
that the plaintiff will pay all costs that may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, if
the same be wrongful or without sufticient cause, not exceeding the
sum specified in the undertaking.

4. If the undestaking be executed without sureties, the plaintiff
shall file therewith, his affidavit that he is a resident and householder
or freeholder within the state, and worth double the sum specified in
the undertaking, over all his debts and liabilities. If it be executed
with sureties, the plaintiff shall file therewith, the affidavits of such
sureties that they are residents within the state; from which afiidavits
it must appear that such sureties taken together, are worth double the
amount of the sum specified in the undertaking, over all debts and
liabilities, and property exempt from execution. No person not qualified to become bail upon an arrest, is qualified to become surety in an
undertaking for an arrest.

5. The writ of arrest shall be issued by the clerk, and shall
require the sheriff of any county where the defendant may be found,
forthwith to arrest him and hold him to bail in the amount specified in
the order, and that in default thereof, he keep him in custody until discharged by law, and to return the writ to the clerk from whom it

made, subscribed by himself or attorney. The sheriff upon the delivcry of the writ shall endorse thereon the date of the receipt, and upon
the arrest of the defendant, shall deliver to him a copy of the writ, and
such copy of the aiiidavit. The sheriff shall execute the writ, by
arresting the defendant and keeping him in custody, until discharged
by law.

SEC. 108. The defendant at any time before execution, shall be
discharged from the arrest, either upon giving bail, or upon depositing
the amount mentioned in the Writ of arrest as provided in this title.

SEC. 109. The defendant may give bail, by causing a written undertaking to be executed in favor of the plaintiff by two or more sufiieient
sureties, stating their places of residence, to the effect that the defendant shall at all times render himself amenable to the process of the
court, during the pendency of the action, and to such as may be issued
to enforce the judgment therein, or if he be arrested for the cause
mentioned in the third subdivision of section 106, an undertaking to
the same effect as that provided by section 135.

SEC. 110. At any time before a failure to comply with the undertaking the bail may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or
he may surrender himself to the sheriff of the county where he was
arrested, in the following manner:

1. A certified copy of the undertaking of the bail shall be delivered to the sheriff, who shall detain the defendant in his custody
thereon as upon a writ of arrest, and shall by a certificate in writing
acknowledge the surrender.

2. Upon the production of a copy of the undertaking and sheri&"s
certificate, the judge of the court may upon a notice to the plaintiff of
eight days, with a copy of the certificate, order that the bail be exonerated, and on filing the order and the papers used on said application,
with the clerk of the court where the action is pending, they shall be
exonerated accordingly. But this section shall not apply to an arrest
for cause mentioned in the third subdivision of section 106, so as to discharge the bail from an undertaking given to the effect provided by section 135.

SEC. 111. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail
at any time and place, before they are finally charged, may themselves
arrest him, or by a written authority, indorsed on a certified copy of
the undertaking, may empower the sheriff or any other person of
suitable age and discretion to do so.

SEC. 112. In case of the failure to comply with the undertaking,
the bail may he proceeded against by action only.

SEC. 113. The bail may be exonerated either by the death of the
defendant, or his imprisonment in the penitentiary, or by his legal discharge from the obligation to render himself amenable to the process,
or by his surrender to the sheriff of the county where he was arrested,
in execution thereof, within twenty days after the commencement of
the action against the bail, or Within such further time as may be

granted by the court.

SEC. 114. Within five days from the execution of the undertaking
of the hail, the sheriff shall deliver to the plaintiff or his attorney, if
either of them reside within the county Where the arrest was made, or
otherwise to such person within said county as the plaintiff may direct,
a certified copy of the undertaking, with the date of the arrest endorsed
thereon. In any other case the sheriff may mail such copy, within the
same time to the plaintiff or his attorney, within the State, or to either
of them as the plaintiff may direct. The plaintiff Within ten days
from the delivery of such copy, or fifteen days from the mailing of the
same, if sent by mail, may serve upon the sheriff a notice that he does
not accept the bail, or he shall be deemed to have accepted it, and the
sheriff shall be exonerated from liability. If no notice be served
within ten days, the original undertaking shall be filed with the clerk
of the court where the action is pending.

SEC. 115. On the receipt of such notice, the sheriff’ or defendant
may, Within ten days thereafter, give to the plaintiff or his attorney
notice of the justification of the same or other bail, specifying the
places of residence and occupation of the latter, before a judge of the
circuit court, or county court, or clerk of the court where the action is
pending, at a specified time and place; the time to be not less than
five, nor more than ten days thereafter. In case neither the plaintiff
or his attorney reside within the county where the arrest is made, the

notice may be served upon the person and in the manner provided for
serving the copy of the undertaking in section 114. In case other bail
be given there shall be a new undertaking in the form and to the effect
prescribed in section 109.

SEC. 116. The qualifications of bail shall be as follows:

1. Each of them shall be a resident and householder or freeholder within the state; but no counsellor or attorney at law, sheriff,
clerk of any court, or other oflicer of any court, shall be permitted to
become bail in any action.

2. Each of them shall be worth the amount specilied in the writ
of arrest, or the amount to which the same may be reduced as provided
in this title over and above all debts and liabilities, and exclusive of
property exempt from execution; but the judge or clerk on justification may allow more than two sureties to justify severally in amounts
less than that expressed in the writ, if the whole justification be equivalent to that of two sufiicient bail.

SEC. 117. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail shall
attend before the judge or clerk, at the time and place mentioned in the
notice, and may be examined on oath, on the part of the plaintiif,
touching his sufficiency, in such manner as the judge or clerk in his
discretion may think proper. The examination shall be reduced to
writing and subscribed by the bail, if required by the plaintiff.

SEC. 118. If the judge or clerk find the bail suflicient, he shall
annex the examination to the undertaking, indorse his allowance
thereon, and cause them to be filed with the clerk of the court in
which the action is pending; and the sheriff shall thereupon be
exonerated from liability. '

SEC. 119. The defendant may at the time of his arrest, instead of
giving bail, deposit with the sheriff the amount mentioned in the writ.
Thereupon the sheriff shall give the defendant a certificate of the
deposit made, and the defendant shall be discharged out of custody.

SEC. 120. The sheriff shall within four days after the deposit pay
the same into court, and take from the clerk receiving the same two
certificates of such payment, the one of which he shall deliver to the
plaintiff or his attorney, and the other to the defendant. For any
default in making such payment, the same proceedings may be had on
the official bond of the sheriff to collect the sum deposited, as in other
cases of delinquency.

SEC. 121. If money be deposited, as provided in the last two sections, bail may be given and justified upon notice, as prescribed in section 109, at any time before judgment, and on the tiling of the
undertaking and justincation with the clerk, the money deposited shall
be refunded by such clerk to the defendant.

SEC. 122. When money shall have been so deposited, if it remain
on deposite at the time of an order or judgment for the payment of
money to the plaintiff, the clerk shall, under the direction of the court,
apply the same in satisfaction thereof, and after satisfying the judgment shall refund the surplus, if any, to the defendant. If the
judgment be in favor of the defendant, the clerk shall refund to him
the whole sum deposited and ‘remaining unapplied.

SEC. 123. If, after being arrested the defendant escape, or be

rescued, or bail be not given, or justified, or a deposite be not made
instead thereof, the sheriff himself shall be liable as bail ; but he may

discharge himself from such liability, by the giving and justification
of bail, as provided in sections, 115, 116, 117 and 118, at any time
before process against the person of the defendant, to enforce an order

or judgment in the action.

SEC. 124. If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff upon his
liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatisfied, in
whole or in part, the same proceedings may be had on his oihcial bond
for the recovery of the whole or any deficiency, as in other cases of
delinquency.

SEC. 125. The bail taken upon the arrest, shall, unless they justify,

or other bail be given or justified, be liable to the sheriff by action for
any damages which he may sustain by reason of such omission.

SEC. 126. The fees which shall be allowed to the sheriff for the

food and maintenance of any defendant arrested under the provisions‘

of this act, shall be as provided by law and the plaintiff shall be liable

record the transcript of any order, entry of satisfaction of judgment,
or other proceeding of record, whereby it appears that such lien has
been discharged, in the book mentioned in this section. The clerk

of the defendant, and not otherwise.

6. The court may then charge the jury.

SEC. 195. VVhenever in the opinion of the court, it is proper that
the jury should have a view of real property which is the subject of
the litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it

may order the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of a
proper oflicer, to the place, which shall be shown to them by the

judge, or by a person appointed by the court for that purpose. While
the jury are thus absent, no person, other than the judge or the person
so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with the
trial.

SEC. 196. The jurors may be kept together in charge of a proper
ofiicer, or may, in the discretion of the court, at any time before the
submission of the cause to them, be permitted to separate; in either
case they may be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to
converse with any other person, or among themselves, on any subject
connected with the trial, or to express any opinion thereon, until the
case is iinally submitted to them.

SEC. 197. If, after the formation of the jury, and before verdict, a
juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty, the court
may order him to be discharged. In that case unless the parties agree
to proceed with the other jurors, a new juror may be sworn, and the
trial begin anew; or the jury may be discharged, and a new jury then
or afterwards formed.

SEC. 198. In charging the jury, the court shall state to them all
matters of law which it thinks necessary for their information in giving
their verdict, and if it presents the facts of the case, it shall also inform
them that they are the exclusive judges of all questions of fact.

SEC. 199. A juror may be examined by either party as a witness.
if he be otherwise competent. If he be not so examined, he shall not
communicate any private knowledge or information that he may have
of the matter in controversy, to his fellow jurors, nor be governed by

the same in giving his verdict.

SEC. 200. After hearing the charge, the jury may either decide in
the jury box, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they must be
kept together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient
place, under the charge of one or more officers, until they agree upon
their verdict, or are discharged by the-court. The oiiieer shall, to the
utmost of his ability, keep the jury thus together separate from other
persons, without drink, except water, and without food, except ordered
by the court. He must not suffer any communication to be made to
them, nor make any himself, unless by the order of the court, except
to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, and he shall not,

before the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of
their deliberations or the verdict agreed on. Before any officer takes

they shall be so provided by the sheriff, at the expense of the county.

SEC. 202. Upon returning for deliberation, the jury may take with
them the pleadings, in the cause, and all papers which have been
received as evidence on the trial, (except depositions;) or copies of
such parts of public records or private documents given in evidence as

having them in possession. They may also take with them notes of
the testimony or other proceedings on the trial taken by themselves,
or any of them, but none taken by any other person.

SEC. 203. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a
disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if they
desire to be informed of any point of law arising in the case, they may
require the‘ oflicer having them in charge to conduct them into court.
Upon their being brought into court, the information required shall be
given in the presence of, or after notice to the parties or their attornies.

SEC. 204. Except as provided in sections 197 and 207, or in case of
some accident or calamity requiring their discharge, the jury shall not
be discharged after the cause is submitted to them, until they have
agreed upon a verdict, and given it in open court, unless by the
consent of both parties entered in the journal, or unless at the expiration of such_period as the court deem proper, it satisfactorily appears,
that there is no probability of an agreement.

SEC. 205. In all cases Where a jury are discharged, or prevented

progress of the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, the action
may be again tried immediately, or at a future time, as the court
directs.

SEC. 206. When the jury are absent, the court may adjourn from
time to time, in respect to other business, but it is nevertheless to be
deemed open, for every purpose connected with the cause submitted

to the jury, until a verdict is rendered or the jury discharged. A final
adjournment of the court discharges the jury.

SEC. 207. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict, they shall
be conducted into court by the oiiieer having them in charge. Their
names shall then be called, and if all do not appear, the rest shall be
discharged without giving a verdict.

Sec. 208. If the jury appear, they shall be asked by the court or
the clerk, whether they have agreed upon their verdict;° and if the
foreman answer in the aliirmative, he shall, on being required, declare
the same.

SEC. 209. When a verdict is given, and before it is filed, the jury
may be polled on the request of either party ; for which purpose each
shall be asked whether it be his verdict; if any juror answer in the
negative, the jury shall be sent out for further deliberation. If the
verdict be informal or insuilicient, it may be corrected by the jury under
the advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.

SEC. 210. When the verdict is given, and is such as the court may
receive, and if no juror disagree, or the jury be not again sent out, the
clerk shall file the verdict. The verdict is then complete, and the

upon the same wherever he may find it. But if such property is in the

SEC. 283. When personal property shall be seized by virtue of any
execution, and any person other than the defendant, shall claim such
property or any part thereof, and shall give notice thereof in Writing,

and’ signed by the foreman, shall be a full indemnity to the sheriff;
proceeding in accordance therewith, but shall not preclude the claimant
from maintaining an action at law for the recovery of the possesion of
such property, or for damages for taking the same.

SEC. 285. The claimant at any time before the jury retire, may Withdraw his claim, or the plaintiff in the writ, may within the same time
direct the sheriff to discharge the property from the execution, and

thereupon, the trial shall proceed no further. The costs and disbursements of the trial shall be paid by the party against whom the verdict
is given, or if no verdict be given, as in this section provided, then by
the party who withdrew his claim, or directed the property to be discharged, as the case may be. The sheriff shall collect all such costs
and disbursements, if not paid immediately, by levying on the property of the party liable for them, as on execution, and pay the same,
to the jurors, witnesses and others entitled to receive them.

claimant, yet the sheriff shall proceed to sell the property seized in
satisfaction of the execution, if the plaintiff tender to him a written
undertaking, excecuted by two or more good and suflicient sureties,
residents of the state, and householders or freeholders therein, in
double the value of the property, to the effect that he will indemnify
the sheriff against all damages and costs, which he may sustain in
consequence of the seizure and sale of such property, and moreover,
that he will pay to the claimant of such property, all damages which
he may sustain in consequence of such seizure and sale. If such
undertaking be given it shall be returned by the sheriff with the
execution.

SEC. 287. When the sheriff shall levy upon personal property by
virtue of an execution, he may permit the judgment debtor, to retain
the same, or any part thereof in his possession until the day of sale,
upon the defendant executing a written undertaking to the sheriff
with sufficient surety, in double the value of such property, to the
effect that it shall be delivered to the sheriff at the time and place of
sale, and for non-delivery thereof, an action may be maintained upon
such undertaking by the sheriff or the plaintiff in the execution; but
the sheriff shall not thereby be discharged from his liability to the
plaintiff for" such property.

SEC. 288. Before the sale of property on execution, notice thereof
shall be given as follows : .

1. In case of personal property, by posting written or printed
notice of the time and place of sale, in three public places of the county
where the sale is to take place, not less than ten days successively;

2. In case of real property, by posting a similar notice, particularly describing the property, for four weeks successively, in three
public places of the county, where the property is to be sold, and

publishing a copy thereof once a week, for the same period, in a newspaper of the county, if there be one, or if there be none, then in a
newspaper published nearest to the place of sale; or in the newspaper
published by the state printer.

SEC. 289. All sales of property upon execution shall be made by
auction, between nine o’c1oek in the morning andfour o'clock in the
evening. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold. Neither the ofhcer holding the execution,
nor his deputy, shall become a purchaser or be interested in any
purchase at such sale. When the sale is of personal property capable
of manual delivery and not in the possession of a third person, association, or corporation, it shall be within view of those who attend the
sale, and be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest
price, and when the sale is of real property, and consisting of several
known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately or otherwise as is
likely to bring the highest price, or _when a portion of such real
property is claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold

separately, such portion shall be sold separately. Sales of real prop-"'

erty shall be made at the court house door.

SEC. 290. If at the time appointed for the sale, the sheriff’ should
be prevented from attending at the place appointed, or being present
should deem it for the advantage of all concerned to postpone the sale
for want of purchasers, or other suilieient cause, he may postpone the
sale not exceeding one week, next after the day appointed, and so from

to be due thereon,_or the particular property-of which the possession
was thereby adjudged to such party. remaining undelivered. The
motion shall be subscribed and verified in like manner as a complaint
in an action at law.

2. At any time after nling such motion, the party may cause a
summons to be served on the judgment debtor in like manner and with
like effect, as in an action at law. In case such judgment debtor be
dead, the summons may be served upon his representatives, by publication as in case of a non-resident, or by actual service of the summons.

3. The summons shall be substantially the same as in an action
at law, but instead of the notice therein required, it shall state the
amount claimed or the property sought to be recovered, in the manner
prescribed in subdivision 1 of this section.

4. The judgment debtor, or in case of his death, his representatives, may file an answer to such motion, within the time allowed to

SEC. 293. Whenever real property is sold on execution, the previsions of this section shall apply to the subsequent proceedings:
1. The plaintiff in the writ of execution shall be entitled, on

motion therefor, to have an order confirming the sale, at the term
next following the return of the execution, or if it be returned in term
time then at such term; unless the judgment debtor, or in case of his
death his representative, shall file with the clerk ten days before such
term, or if the writ be returned in term time, then five days after the
return thereof, his objections thereto.

2. If such objections be filed, the court shall notwithstanding
allow the order confirming the sale, unless on the hearing of the
motion it shall satisfactorily appear, that there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, to the probable loss or
injury of the party objecting. In the latter case the court shall disallow the motion,'and direct that the property be resold in whole or
in part as the case may be, as upon an execution received of that date.

be taken except for a greater amount. If the motion to confirm be
not heard and decided at the term at which it is made it may be continued and heard and determined before the judge, or at any term
thereafter. An order confirming a sale, shall be a conclusive determination, of the regularity of ‘the proceedings concerning such sale,
as to all persons, in any other action, suit or proceeding whatever.

5. If after the satisfaction of the judgment, there be any proceeds
of the sale remaining, the clerk shall pay such proceeds to the judgment debtor, or his representative, as the case may be, at any time
before the order is made, upon the motion to confirm the sale, provided
such party file with the clerk a waiver of all objections made or to be

obligation or contract of one of them as security for another, and the

allow such redemption.

SEC. 303. Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption,

SEC. 305. After the issuing of an execution against property, and
upon proof by the affidavit of the plaintiff‘ in the writ, or otherwise,
to the satisfaction of the court or judge thereof, that the judgment
debtor has property liable to execution, which he refuses to apply
towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may by
an order require the judgment debtor to appear and answer under
oath concerning the same, before such court or judge, or before a
referee, appointed by such court or judge, at a time and place specified
in the order.

SEC. 306. On the appearance of the judgment debtor, he may be
examined on -oath concerning his property. His examination if

required by the plaintiff in the writ, shall be reduced to writing, and

transferring or in any manner disposing of any of his property liable
to execution, pending the proceeding. Disobedience to any order or
requirement authorized by sections 305, 806, and 307 on the part of
the judgment debtor may be punished as for a contempt.

SEC. 308. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the
judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sections, the court or
judge may, upon proof by afiidavit of a party or otherwise, to his
satisfaction, that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state, or
concealing himself therein, and that there is reason to believe he has
property which he unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, issue a
warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where such debtor may be,
to arrest him and bring him before the court or judge; upon being
brought before the court or judge, he may be examined on oath, and
if it then appear that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state,
and that he has property which he has unjustly refused to apply to
such judgment, he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking with
one or more sureties, that he will from time to time attend before the
court or judge as may be directed, and that he will not, during the
pendency of the proceedings, dispose_ of any portion of his property

property of the judgment debtor shall apply to any person or ofiicer
mentioned in subdivision 3 of section 147, for the purpose of levying
on any property therein mentioned, such person or oflicer shall forthwith give to the sheriff a certificate in the manner prescribed in section
150. If such person or officer refuse to do so, or if the certiiicate be
unsatisfactory to the plaintiff in the writ, he may in like manner, have
the order prescribed in such section against such person or oilicer.
Thereafter the proceeding upon such order shall be conducted in the

manner prescribed in title XIV. of chapter I. from section 160 to section 169 inclusive.

SEC. 310. The earnings of a judgment debtor for personal services,

SEC. 313. Any person who has a legal estate in real property, and

a present right to the possession thereof, may recover such possession,
with damages for withholding the same by an action at law. Such
action shall be commenced against the person in the actual possession
of the property at the time, or if the property be not in the actual
possession of any one, then against the person acting as the owner
thereof.

SEC. 314. A defendant who is in actual possession, may for answer
plead, that he is in possession only as tenant of another, naming him,
and his place of residence, and thereupon, the landlord if he apply
therefor, shall be made defendant in place of the tenant, and the action
shall proceed in all respects as if originally commenced against him.
If the landlord do not apply to be made defendant within the day the
tenant is allowed to answer, thereafter he shall not be allowed to, but.
he shall be made defendant if the plaintiff require it. If the landlord
be made defendant on motion of the plaintiff he shall be required to
appear and answer, within ten days from notice of the peudency of the
action and the order making him defendant, or such further notice as
the court or judge thereof may prescribe.

SEC. 315. The plaintiff in his complaint, shall set forth the nature
of his estate in the property, whether it be in fee, for life, or for a term
of years, and for whose life, or the duration of such term, and that he
is entitled to the possession thereof, and that the defendant wrongfully
withholds the same from him to his damage such sum as may be
therein claimed. . The property shall be described with such certainty
as to enable the possession thereof to be delivered, if a recovery be had.

SEC. 316. The defendant shall not be allowed to give in evidence
any estate in himself, or another in the property, or any license or
right to the possession thereof unless the same be pleaded in his
answer. If so pleaded the nature and duration of such estate, or

license or right to the possession, shall be set forth with the certainty
and particularity required in a complaint. If the defendant does

not defend for the whole of the property, he shall specify for what
particular part he does defend. In an action against a tenant the
judgment shall be conclusive against a landlord, who has been made
defendant in place of the tenant, to the same extent as if the action

had been originally commenced against him.

SEC. 317. The jury by their verdict shall find as follows:
1. If the verdict be for the plaintiff, that he is entitled to the

possession of the property described in the complaint, or some part
thereof, or some undivided share or interest in.either, and the nature
and duration of his estate in such property, part thereof, or undivided
share or interest in either, as the case may be. ~

2. If the verdict be for the defendant, that the plaintiff‘ is not
entitled to the possession of the property described in the complaint,
or to such part thereof, as the defendant defends for, and the estate in
such property or part thereof, or license or right to the possession of
either, established on the trial by the defendant, if any; in effect as
the same is requiredto be pleaded. .

SEC. 318. The plaintiff shall only be entitled to recover damages
for withholding the property for the term of six years next preceding
the commencement of the action, and for ‘any period that may elapse
from such commencement, to the time of giving a verdict therein,
exclusive of the use of permanent improvements made by the defends
ant. When permanent improvements have been ~made upon the
property by the defendant, or those under whom he claims, holding
under color of title adversely to the claim of the plaintiff, in good faith,
the value thereof at the time of trial, shall be allowed as a set-off
against such damages. ‘

SEC. 319. If the right of the plaintiff to the possession of the
property expire after the commencement of the action, and before the
trial, the verdict shall be given according to the fact, and judgment
shall be given only for the damages.

to the adverse party, may, for cause shown, grant an order allowing
the party applying therefor to enter upon the property in controversy,
and make survey and admeasurement thereof, for the purposes of the

action.

SEC. 321. The order shall describe the property, and a copy thereof
shall be served upon the defendant, and thereupon the party may enter
upon the property, and make such survey and admeasurement, but if
any unnecessary injury be done to the premises, he shall be liable

therefor.

SEC. 322. An action for the recovery of the possession of real
property against a person in possession, cannot be prejudiced by any
alienation made by such person, either before or after the commencement of the action; but if such alienation be made after the commencement of the action, and the defendant do not satisfy the judgment
recovered for damages; for withholding the possession, such damages
may be recovered by action against the purchaser.

SEC. 323. A mortgage of real property shall not be deemed a conveyance, so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of the real property without a foreclosure and sale according

to law.

Sec. 324. In an action for the recovery of dower before admeasurement, or by a tenant in common of real property against a co-tenant,
the plaintiff shall show in addition to the evidence of his right of
possession, that the defendant either denied the plaintiffs right, or did
some act amounting to such denial.

SEC. 325. When in case of a lease of real property, and the failure
of tenant to pay rent, the landlord has a subsisting right to re-enter
for such failure, he may bring an action to recover the possession of
such property, and such action is equivalent to a demand of the rent,
and a re-entry upon the property. But, if at any time before judgment
in such action, the lessee or his successor in interest,‘ as to the whole
or a part of the property, pay to the plaintiff, or bring into court the
amount of rent then in arrear with interest, and the costs of the action,
and perform the other covenants or agreements on the part of the
lessee, he shall be entitled to continue in the possession, according to
the terms of the lease.

SEC. 326. In an action to recover the possession of real property
the judgment therein, shall be conclusive as to the estate in such
property and the right to the possession thereof, so far as the same is
thereby determined, upon the party against whom the same is given,
and against all persons claiming from, through, or under such party,
after the commencement of such action, except as in this section
provided. When service of the summons is made by publication and
judgment is given for want of answer, at any time within two years
from the entry thereof, the defendant or his successor in interest as to
the whole or any part of the property, shall upon application to the
court or judge thereof, be entitled to an order vacating the judgment
and granting him a new trial, upon the payment -of the costs of

the action.

SEC. 327. If the plaintiff has taken possession of the property
before the judgment is set aside and a new trial granted as provided in section 326, such possession shall not be thereby affected in any way,
and if judgment be given for the defendant in the new trial, he shall
be entitled to restitution by execution in the same manner as if he
were plaintiff.

SEC. 328. In an action to recover the possession of real property by
a tenant in dower, or his successor in interest, if such estate in dower
has not been admeasured before the commencement of the action, the
plaintiff shall not have execution to deliver the possession thereof,
until the same be admeasured, as follows:

1. At any time after the entry of judgment in favor of the
plaintiff, he may upon notice to the adverse party, move the court for
the appointment of referees, to admeasure the dower out of the real
property, of which the possession is recovered by the action. The
court shall allow such motion, unless it appear probable on the hearing
that a partition of such property cannot-be made without prejudice to
the interests of the other owners. In the latter case, the court shall
disallow the motion, and thereafter the plaintiff shall only proceed for
partition or sale of such real property as provided in title V. of chapter V.

2. If the court allow the motion‘, thereafter the proceedings shall
be conducted as provided in such title.

At any time after the confirmation of the report of the referees, the

‘ plaintiff may have execution for the delivery of the possession of the
property according to the admeasurement thereof, and for the damages

recovered, if any, for withholding the same, if such damages remain
unsatisfied.

3. If the motion for admeasurement, be made at the term at
which judgment was given, the notice thereof shall be served on the

adverse party such time as the court by general rule, or special order
may prescribe.

SEC. 329. In an action at law for the recovery of the possession of
real property, if either party claim the property as a donee of the
United States, under the act of Congress, approved, .September
27th, A. D., 1850, commonly called the Donation law, or the acts
amendatory thereof, such party from the date of his settlement
thereon, as provided in said acts, shall be deemed to have a legal
estate in fee in such property, to continue upon the condition ‘that he
perform the conditions required by such acts, which estate is unconditional and indefeasible after the performance of such conditions. In

such action, if both plaintiff and defendant claim title to the same
real property, by virtue of settlement under such acts, such settlement
and the performance of the subsequent conditions, shall be conclusively
presumed, in favor of the party having or claiming under the elder
patent certificate, or patent as the case may be, unless it appear upon
the face of such certificate or patent, that the same is absolutely void.

warrant.

SEC. 330. Any person vvhose property is affected by a private
nuisance, or Whose personal enjoyment thereof, is in like manner
thereby alfected, may maintain an action at law for damages therefor.
If judgment be given for the plaintiff in such action, he may, in
addition to the execution to enforce the same, on motion, have an
order, allowing a warrant to issue to the sheriff, to abate such nuisance.
Such motion must be made at the term at which judgment is given,
and shall be allowed of course, unless it appear on the hearing that
the nuisance has ceased, or that such remedy is inadequate to abate or
prevent the continuance of the nuisance, in which latter case the
plaintiff may proceed in equity to have the defendant enjoined.

SEC. 331. If the order be made, the clerk shall thereafter at any
time- Within six months, when requested by the plaintiff, issue such
Warrant directed to the sheriff, requiring him forthwith to abate the
nuisance at the expense of the defendant, and return the Warrant as
soon thereafter as may be, with his proceedings endorsed thereon.
The expense of abating the nuisance may be levied by the sheriff on
the property of the defendant, and in this respect the warrant is to be

deemed an execution against property.

SEC. 332. At any time before the order is made or the warrant
issues, the defendant may on motion to the court or judge thereof,

have an order to stay the issuing of such Warrant, for such period as
may be necessary not exceeding six months, to allow the defendant to
abate the nuisance himself, upon his giving an undertaking to the
plaintiffin a sufficient amount, with one or more sureties to the satisfaction of the court or judge thereof, that he will abate it within the
time and in the manner specified in such order.

SEC. 333. If the plaintiff is not notified of the time and place of

SEC. 404. An injunction is an order requiring a defendant in a suit
to refrain from a particular act; it is only allowed as a provisional
remedy, and when a decree is given enjoining a defendant, such decree
shall be effectual and binding on such defendant without other proceeding or process, and may be enforced if necessary as provided in section 402.

SEC. 405. An injunction may be allowed by the court or judge
thereof at any time after the commencement of the suit and before
decree. Before allowing the same, the court or judge, shall require of
the plaintiff an undertaking with one or more sureties, to the effect
that he will pay all costs and disbursements that may be decreed to
the defendant, and such damages, not exceeding an amount therein
specified, as he may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the same
be wrongful or without sufficient cause.

SEC. 406. The undertaking and affidavits, if any, upon which the
injunction is allowed, shall be filed with the clerk. The order may be
served as a summons, and returned to the clerk, with the proof of
service endorsed thereon; except, that the service shall be made upon
the defendant personally. The order may be filed with the clerk at
once, and shall be deemed to be served upon the defendant from the

date of its allowance, if it appear therefrom, that the defendant
appeared before the- court or judge at the allowance thereof.

SEC. 407. When it appears by the complaint that the defendant is
entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof‘,
consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act, the
commission or continuance of which, during the litigation, would
produce injury to the plaintiif; or when it appears by afiidavit that
the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring
or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the plaintiifs rights,
concerning the subject of the suit, and tending to render the decree
ineffectual; or when it appears by affidavit, that the defendant
threatens, or is about to remove or dispose of his property or any part
thereof with intent to delay or defraud his creditors; an injunction
may be allowed to restrain such act, removal, or disposition.

SEC. 408. An injunction shall not be allowed after the defendant
has answered, except upon notice, but in such case the defendant may
be restrained until the decision of the court or judge allowing; or
refusing the injunction ; and before answer, if the court or judge deem
it proper that the defendant should be heard before allowing an
injunction, an order may be made requiring the defendant to shew
cause at a specified time and place why the injunction should not be
allowed ; and in the meantime the defendant may be restrained.

SEC. 409. If the injunction be allowed without notice, the defendant may, at any time after answer and before trial, apply, upon notice,
to the court or judge thereof to vacate or modify the same. The
application may be made upon affidavits in addition to the answer, and
if so the plaintiff may oppose the same by atlidavits or other evidence,
in addition to those upon which the injunction was allowed. If upon
the hearing of the motion it satisfactorily appears that the injunction

should not have been allowed, either in whole or in part, it shall be .

vacated or modified accordingly.

SEC. 410. A lien upon real or personal property, other than that
of a judgment or decree, Whether created by mortgage or otherwise
shall be foreclosed and the property adjudged to be sold to satisfy the
debt secured thereby, by a suit. In such suit in addition to the decree
of foreclosure and sale, if it appear that a promissory note or other
personal obligation for the payment of the debt, has been given by the
mortgagor or other lien debtor, or by any other person as principal or
otherwise, the court shall also decree a recovery of the amount of such
debt against such person or persons as the case may be, as in the case
of an ordinary decree for the recovery of money.

SEC. 411. Any person_ having a lien subsequent to the plaintiff
upon the same property or any part thereof, or who has given a
promissory note or other personal obligation for the payment of the
debt or any part thereof, secured by the mortgage or other lien which
is the subject of -the suit, shall be made a defendant in the suit, and
any person having a prior lien may be made defendant at the option
of the plaintiff, or by the order of the court when deemed necessary.

SEC. 412. When it is adjudged that any of the defendants have a
lien upon the property, the court shall make a like decree in relation
thereto, and the debt secured thereby as if such defendant were a
plaintiff in the suit; and when a. decree is given foreclosing two or
more liens upon the same property or any portion thereof in favor
of different persons not united in interest. Such decree shall determine and specify the order of time, according to their priority, in
which the debts secured by such liens shall be satisfied out of the
proceeds of the sale of the property.

SEC. 413. The decree may be enforced by the execution as _an
ordinary decree for the recovery of money except as in this section

otherwise or specially provided :
1. When a decree of foreclosure and sale is given, an execution

may issue thereon against the property adjudged to be sold. If the
decree is in favor of the plaintiff only, the execution may issue as in
ordinary cases, but if it be in favor of different persons, not united in
interest, it shall issue upon the joint request of such persons, or upon
the order of the court or judge thereof on the motion of either of them.

2. "When the degree is also against the defendants or any one of
them in person, and the proceeds of the sale of the property upon
which the lien is foreclosed is not suiiicient to satisfy the decree, as the
sum remaining unsatisfied, the decree may be enforced by execution
as in ordinary cases. Vfhen in such cases the decree is in favor of
different persons not united in interest, it shall be deemed a separate
decree as to such persons and may be enforced accordingly.

SEC. 414. A decree of foreclosure shall have the effect to bar the
equity of redemption, and property sold on execution issued upon a.
decree may be redeemed in like pianner and with like effect, as property sold on an execution issued on a judgment, and not otherwise.

SEC. 415. When any of the proceeds of the sale remains with the
clerk unclaimed by the person who is entitled to the same for the
period of two months, the court or judge thereof shall direct that the
same be put at interest by the clerk, subject to the order of the court,

for the benefit of such person, his representatives, or assigns.

SEC. 416. During the pendency of an action at. law, for the recovery of a debt secured by any lien mentioned in section 410, a suit cannot be maintained for the foreclosure of such lien, nor thereafter,
unless judgment be given in such action that the plaintiff recover such
debt or some part thereof, and an execution thereon against the property of the defendant in the judgment, is returned unsatisfied in whole

or in part.

SEC. 417. When a suit is commenced to foreclose a lien, by which
any debt is secured, which debt is payable in instalments either of
interest or principal, and any of such instalments is not then due, the
court shall decree a foreclosure of the lien, and may also decree a sale
of the property for the satisfaction of the whole of such debt, or so
much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the instalment then due
with costs of suit; and in the latter case the decree of foreclosure as
to the remainder of the property, may be enforced by an order ‘of sale
in whole or in part, whenever default shall be made in the payment of
the instalments not then due.

SEC. 418. If beforea decree is given the amount then due with the
costs of suit is brought into court and paid to the clerk, the suit shall
be dismissed, or if the same be done after decree and before sale, the
effect of the decree as to the amount then due and paid, shall be terminated, and the execution if any have issued be recalled by the clerk.
When an instalment not due is adjudged to be paid, the court shall
determine and specify in the decree what sum shall be received in satisfaction thereof, which sum may be equal to such instalment or otherwise, according to the present value thereof. The provisions of this title, as to liens upon personal property, are not to be construed, so as
to exclude a person having such , lien, from any other remedy or right,

in regard to such property.

SEC. 419. When several persons hold and are in possession of real
property as tenants in common, in which one or more of them have
an estate of inheritance, or for life or years, a suit may be maintained
by one or more of such persons, for a partition thereof according to
the respective rights of the persons interested therein, and for a sale
of such property or a part of it, if it appear that a partition cannot be
made without great prejudice to the owners.

SEC. 420. The interest of all persons in the property, whether such
persons be known or unknown, shall be set forth in the complaint,
specifically and particularly as far as known to the plaintiff, and if one
or more of the parties, or the share or quantity of interest of any of
the parties, be unknown to the plaintiff, or be uncertain, or contingent, or the ownership of the inheritance depend upon an executory devise, or.the remainder be a contingent remainder, so that such
parties cannot be named, that fact shall be set forth in the complaint.

SEC. 421. The plaintiff may at his option, make creditors having a
lien upon the property or any portion thereof, other than by judgment
or decree, defendants in the suit. When the lien is upon an undivided interest or estate of any of ' the parties, such lien, if a partition
be made, is theuceforth alien only on the share assigned to such party;
but such share shall be first charged with its just proportion of the

costs of the partition, in preference to such lien.

SEC. 422. The summons shall be directed by name to all the
tenants in common, who are known, and in the same manner to all
lien creditors who are made parties to the suit, and generally to all
persons unknown, having or claiming an interest or estate in the
property.

SEC. 423. If a party having a share or interest in, or lien upon the
property be unknown, or either of the known parties reside out of the
state or cannot be found therein, and such fact be made to appear by
affidavit, the summons may be served on such absent or unknown
party, by .publication, directed by the court or judge as in ordinary
cases. When service of the summons is made by publication, it must
be accompanied by a brief description of the property, which is the
subject of the suit.

SEC. 424. The defendant shall set forth in his answer the nature
and extent of his interest in the property, and if he be a lien creditor,
how such lien was created, the amount of the debt secured thereby,
and remaining due, and whether such debt is secured in any other
way, and if so the nature of such other security.

SEC. 425. The rights of the several parties, plaintiffs as well as
defendants, may be put in issue, tried and determined in such suit,
and where a defendant fails to answer, or where a sale of the property
is necessary, the title shall be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction
of the court, before the decree for partition or sale is given. '

SEC. 426. If it be alleged in the complaint and established by
evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation in the
complaint, to the satisfaction of. the court, that the property or any
part of it, is so situated that partition cannot be made without great
prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof, and for
that purpose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise upon the
requisite proofs being made, it shall decree a partition according to
the respective rights of the parties as ascertained by the court, and
appoint three referees therefor, and shall designate the portion to
remain undived, for the owners whose interests remain unknown or
not ascertained.

SEC. 427. In making the partition, the referees shall divide the
property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties,
quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective
rights of the parties as determined by the court, designating the

several portions by proper land marks, and may employ a surveyor
with the necessary assistants to aid them therein. The referees shall
make 'a report of their proceedings, specifying therein the manner of
executing their trust, describing the property divided and the shares
allotted to each party, with a particular description of each share.

SEC. 428. The court may confirm or set aside the report in whole
or in part, and if necessary appoint new referees. Upon the report
being confirmed, a decree shall be given that such partition be effectual
forever, which decree shall be binding and conclusive:

1. On all parties named therein, and their legal representatives
who have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any part
thereof as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years, or as entitled
to the reversion, remainder, or inheritance of such property or any
part thereof‘, after the termination of a particular estate therein, or who
by any contingency may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who have an interest in any undivided share thereof‘, as tenants
for years or for life;

2. On all persons interested in the property, who may be
unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of the application for
partition by publication, as directed by section 423 ; and

3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons, or
either of them.

SEC. 429. But such decree and partition shall not affect any tenants,
for years or for life of the whole of the property which is the subject
of partition ; nor shall such decree and partition preclude any person,
except such as are specified in the last section, from claiming title to
the property in question, or from controverting the title of the parties
between whom the partition shall have been made.

SEC. 430. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor and his assistants, when employed, shall be ascertained and
allowed by the court, and the amount thereof, together with the fees
allowed by law to the referees, shall be paid by the plaintiff, and may

be allowed as part of the charges.
SEC. 431. If the referees report to the court, that _the property, of

which partition shall have been decreed, or any seperate portion thereof,
is so situated, that a partition thereof’ cannot be made, without great

prejudice to the owners; and the court is satisfied that such report is '

correct, it may thereupon, by an order, direct the referees to sell the
property or seperate portion thereof, so situated.

SEC. 432. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold,
if there be an estate for life or years in an undivided share of the property, the whole of such estate may be set off in any part of the property not ordered to be sold.

SEC. 433. Before making an order of sale, if lien creditors, other
than those by judgment or decree, have not been made parties, the
court on motion of either party shall order the plaintiff to file a supplemental complaint, making such creditors parties defendant to the suit.

SEC. 434. If an order of sale be made, and before a distribution of

-the proceeds thereof, the plaintiff shall produce to the court the certificate of the clerk of the county where the property is situated, showing
the liens remaining unsatisfied, if any, by judgment or decree upon
the property or any portion thereof, and unless he do so, the court
shall order a reference to ascertain them.

SEC. 435. If it appear by such certificate, or reference, in case the
certificate is not produced, that any such liens exist, the court shall
appoint a referee to ascertain what amount remains due thereon, or
secured thereby respectively, and the order of priority in which they
are entitled to be paid out of the property.

SEC. 436. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served at least ten
days before the time for appearance on each person having such lien
by judgment or decree, to appear before the referee at a specified time
and place, to make proof by his own afridavit or otherwise, of the true
amount due, or to become due contingently or absolutely on his judgment or decree.

SEC. 437. The referee shall receive the evidence, and report the
names of the creditors whose liens are established, the amounts due
thereon, or secured thereby, and their priority respectively, and whether
contingent or absolute. He shall attach to his report the proof service
of the notices and the evidence before him.

SEC. 438. The report of the referee may be excepted to, by either
party to the suit, or to the proceedings before the referee in like
manner and with like effect as in ordinary cases. If a lien creditor be
absent from thestate, or his residence therein be unknown, and that
fact appear by aflidavit,‘the court or judge thereof may by order direct

that service of the notice may be made upon his agent or attorney of

record, or by publication thereof, for such time and in such manner as
the order may prescribe.

SEC. 439. If the report of the referee be confirmed, the order of
confirmation is binding and conclusive upon all parties to the suit and
upon the lien creditors who have been duly served with the notice to
appear before the referee as provided in section'486.

SEC. 440. The proceeds of the sale of the incumbcred property,
shall be distributed by the decree of the court, as follows :
1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the suit;
2. To pay the costs of the reference;
3. To satisfy the several liens in their order of priority, by payment of the sums due, and to become due, according to the decree.
4. The residue among the owners of the property sold, according
to their respective shares.

SEC. 441. VVhenever any party to the suit who ‘holds a lien upon
the property or any part thereof, has other securities for the payment
of the amount of such lien, the court may, in its discretion, order such
securities to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale,
or may order a just deduction to be made from the amount of the lien
on the property on account thereof.

SEC. 442. The proceedings to ascertain the amount of the liens,
and to determine their priority as above provided, or those hereinafter
authorized to determine the rights of parties to funds paid into court,
shall not delay the sale, nor affect any other party, whose rights are not
involved in such proceedings.

SEC. 443. The proceeds of sale, and the securities taken by the
referees, or any part thereof, shall be distributed by them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the court so directs. But if no such
direction be given, all such proceeds and securities shall be paid into
court, or deposited as directed by the court.

SEC. 444. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or parcel
belonging to persons who are parties to the suit and who are known,
are paid into court, the suit may be continued as between such parties,
for the determination of their respective claims thereto, which shall be
ascertained and adjudged by the court. Further testimony may be
taken in court, or by a referee at the discretion of the court, and the
court may, if necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law
in controversy, by pleadings as in an original suit.

SEC. 445. All sales of real property made by the referees shall be
made by public auction to the highest bidder, in the manner required

for the sale of real property on execution. The notice shall state the

made a party to the suit, such estate may be iirst set off out of any
part of the property, and a sale made of such parcel, subject to the

such estate be also sold, the sale may be so ordered.

SEC. 449. Any person entitled to an estate for life or years in any
undivided part of the property, whose estate shall have been sold,

principles of law applicable to annuities, a reasonable satisfaction for

instead thereof, by an instrument duly acknowledged or proved in
the same manner as deeds for the purpose of record, and filed with
the clerk.

SEC. 450. If such consent be not given, as provided in the last section, before the report of sale the court shall ascertain and determine

secured or paid over in such manner, as to protect the rights and
interests of the parties. ‘

SEC. 457. The report of sale may be excepted to by any party
entitled to a share of the proceeds, in like manner and with like effect
as in ordinary cases. If the sale be confirmed the order of confirmation shall direct the referees to execute conveyances and take
securities pursuant to such sale, which acts they are hereby authorized
to do. Such order shall have the effect to discharge the property of
the estate or interest of every person mentioned in section 428 and of
tenants for life or years of the property sold, and shall be binding and
conclusive upon all such persons, as if the same were a decree for the
partition of such property, and upon all persons whomsoever as to the
regularity of the proceedings concerning such sale, except as provided

in section 455.

SEC. 458. When aparty entitled to a share of the property, or an

taken, and keep an account, in a book provided and kept for that
purpose in the clerk's office, free for inspection by all persons, of

investments and moneys received by him thereon, and the disposition

between the parties, according to their respective rights, without
prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, the court may
adjudge compensation to be made by one party to another, on account
of the inequality of partition; but such compensation shall not be

SEC. 468. The provisions of title VI. of chapter IV. of this code
shall apply to suits by and against executors and administrators,
except as in this title otherwise or specially provided. Sections 365,
366, and 367, of such title shall not so apply. All causes of suit, by
one person against another however arising, survive to the personal
representatives of the former and against the personal representatives
of the latter. When the cause of suit survives as herein provided,
the executors or administrators may maintain a suit in equity thereon,

against the party, against whom the cause of suit accrued, or after his
death against his personal representatives.

SEC. 469. The next of kin of a deceased person are liable to a suit
in equity by a creditor of the estate to recover the distributive shares,
received out of such estate, or to so much thereof as may be necessary
to satisfy his debt. The.suit may be against all of the next of kin
jointly, or against any one or more of them severally. ‘

SEC. 470. In such suit, the plaintid‘ may recover the value of all
the assets received by all the defendants in the suit if necessary to
satisfy his debt; and the amount of the recovery shall be apportioned
among the defendants, in proportion to the value of the assets received
by each; and no allowance or deduction shall be made from such
amount, on account of there being other next of kin to Whom assets
have also been delivered.

SEC. 471. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a recovery is

had pursuant to section 470, may maintain a suit against all the other
next of kin of the deceased person, to whom any such assets have been
delivered, jointly, or against any of them separately, for a just and
equal contribution, and may recover of each defendant such an amount
as shall be in the same proportion to the whole sum collected of the
plaintiff, as the value of the assets delivered to such defendant bore
to the value of all the assets delivered to all the next of kin of
the deceased.

SEC. 472. Legatees are liable to a suit in equity by a creditor of
the testator to recover the value of any legacy received by them. The
suit may be maintained against all the legatees jointly, or against any
one or more of them severally. In such suit the plaintiff shall not
recover unless he shows:

1. That no assets were delivered by the executor or administrator of the testator, to his next of kin: or

2. That the value of such assets has been recovered by some
other creditor‘:

3. That such assets are not sutiicient to satisfy the demand of
the plaintiff. ‘

And in the last case he shall recover only the deficiency. The
Whole amount which the plaintiff shall recover, shall be apportioned
among all the legatees of the testator, in proportion to the value of their

legacies respectively, and his proportion shall only be recovered of
each legatee.

SEC. 473. In a suit against several next of kin or legatees jointly,
for assets delivered to them, if a recovery be had against such next of
kin or legatees, the cost of such suit shall be apportioned among the
several defendants, in proportion to the amount recoved against each

of them,

SEC. 474. A decree against several next of kin or legatees, shall be
satisfied as to any one of them, by the payment or satisfaction of the
amount recovered against such defendant.

SEC. 475. Heirs and devisees are liable to a suit by a creditor of a
deceased person, to recover the debt of their ancestor or testator to the
extent of the value of any real property inherited by, or devised to,
them. If such suit be against the heirs, all the heirs who are liable
shall be made parties to the suit.

SEC. 476. But the heirs are not liable for the debt, unless it appear
that the personal assets of the deceased were insufiicient to discharge
it, or that after due proceedings the creditor has been unable to collect
the debt from the personal representatives of the deceased, or from his
next of kin or legatees. If the personal assets were suilicient to pay a
part of the debt, or in case a part thereof shall have been collected, the
heirs of such deceased persori are liable for the residue. '

SEC. 477. Section 476.shall not affect the liability of heirs for a
debt of their ancestor, where such debt was, by his will expressly
charged exclusively on the real property descended to such heirs, or
where such debtis by the will expressly directed to be paid out of the
real property descended before resorting to the personal property.

SEC. 478. In cases where the next of kin, legatees, heirs, and
devisees, are liable for the debts of their ancestors, as herein provided,
they shall be liable therefor without other priority or preference than
such ansestors would be. The word debt as used in this title shall be
construed to include all claims for the payment of money whether
liquidated or otherwise, which survive against the personal representatives of the deceased as provided in section 468.

SEC. 479. A decree against an heir or devisee on account of the

debt of his ancestor or tcstator, may be enforced by execution against
the real property shown to have descended to the heir or devisee, and

not otherwise. Such decree shall have preference as a lien on such
real property to any judgment or decree obtained against such heir or
devisee on account of a debt or demand due in his own right.

SEC. 480. When it appears in the suit, that before the commencement thereof, the heir or devisee has aliened the real property
descended to him, or any part thereof, he shall be personally liable
for the value of the property so aliened, and a decree may be given
against him therefor, to be enforced by execution, as if the decree
were for his own debt. No real property aliened in good faith and
for a valuable consideration by an heir or devisee before suit commenced against him, is liable to an execution for the debt of his
ancestor or testator, or in any manner affected by a decree therefor

against such heir, or devisee.

SEC. 481. In a suit against several heirs jointly, or several devisees
jointly, the amount which the plaintiff recovers, must be apportioned
among all the heirs of the ancestor, or devisees of the testator, in proportion to the value of the real property descended or devised, and
such proportion only can be recovered of each heir or devisee.

SEC. 482. A devisee shall not be liable to the creditor of his
testator, unless it appear that the personal assets of the testator, and
the real property descended to his heirs were insutiicient to discharge
the debt, or unless it appear that after due proceedings the creditor has
been unable to recover the debt or any part thereof from the personal
representatives of the testator, or from his next of kin, legatees,
or heirs.

SEC. 483. In either of the cases specified in section 482, the
amount of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the real
property descended, to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, or the amount
which such plaintiff may have failed to recover from the personal
representatives of the testator, his next of kin, legatees and heirs, may
be recovered of the devisees of such testator, to the extent of the
value of the real property devised to them respectively.

SEC. 484. Sections 482 and 483 shall not affect the liability of
devisees, for a debt of their testator, where such debt was by his will
expressly charged exclusively upon the real property devised, or by
the terms of the will made payable by the devisee. or out of the real
property devised, before resorting to the personal property or to any
other real property descended or devised.

SEC. 525. A judgment or decree may be reviewed as prescribed in
this title and not otherwise. An order affecting a substantial right,
and which in effect determines the action or suit so as to prevent a
judgment or decree therein, or a final order affecting a substantial
right and made in a proceeding after judgment or decree, for the
purpose of being reviewed shall be deemed a judgment or decree.

SEC. 526. Any party to a judgment or decree, other than a judgment or decree given by confession or for want of answer, may appeal

therefrom. The party appealing is known as the appellant, and the
adverse party as the respondent, but the title of the action or suit is
not changed in consequence of the appeal.

SEC. 527. An appeal shall be taken and perfected in the manner
prescribed in this section, and not otherwise.

1. The appellant shall cause a notice to be served on the adverse
party and file the original, with proof of service endorsed thereon,
with the clerk where the judgment or decree is entered. Such notice
shall state that the appellant appeals from the judgment or decree or
some specified part thereof, and shall contain the certi’dcate of an
attorney of the court to the effect, that he has examined the judgment
or decree and that the same is substantially erroneous and in what
particulars.

2. Within ten days from the service of notice of the appeal the
appellant shall file with the clerk an undertaking as hereinafter

provided. Within five days thereafter the adverse party shall except‘
to the sufiiciency of the sureties in the undertaking, or he shall be

deemed to have waived his right thereto.

3. The qualifications of sureties in an undertaking on an 'appeal,
shall be the same as in bail on arrest, and if excepted‘ to, they shall
justify in like manner.

4. From the expiration of the time allowed to except to the
sureties in the undertaking, or from the justification thereof, if excepted
to, the appeal shall be deemed perfected. When a party in good faith
gives due notice of an appeal from a judgment or deeree, and thereafter omits through mistake to do any other act necessary to perfect
the ‘appeal, or to stay proceedings, the court or judge thereof may
permit an amendment, or performance of such act, on such terms as
may be just. , ‘

5. An appeal to the supreme court shall be taken by serving and
filing the notice of appeal, within one year from the entry of the
judgment or decree appealed from or to the circuit court within six
months after such entry, and not otherwise.

SEC. 528. The undertaking of the appellant shall be given with
one or more sureties, to the effect that the appellant will pay all damages, costs and disbursements which may be awarded against him on
the appeal; but such undertaking does not stay the proceedings, unless
the undertaking further provides to the effect following:

1. If the judgment or decree appealed from be for the recovery

of money, or of personal property, or the value thereof; that if the
same or any part thereof be arliirnred, the appellant will satisfy it so

far as &rmed.
2. If the judgment or decree appealed from be for the recovery

of the possession of real property, for a partition thereof, or the foreclosure of a lien thereon; that during the possession of such property
by the appellant he will not commit, or suffer to be committed any
waste thereon, and that if such judgment or decree or any part thereof

be amrmed, the appellant will pay the value of the use and occupation ‘

of such property so far as adirmed, from the time of the appeal until
the delivery of the possession thereof, not exceeding a sum therein
specined, to be ascertained and fixed by the court or judge thereof.

a 3. If the decree appealed from require the transfer -or delivery of
any personal property, unless the things required to be transferred or
delivered, be brought into court or placed in the custody of such officer
or receiver as the court may appoint; that the appellant will obey the
decree of the appellate court. The amount of such undertaking shall
be specified therein, and be fixed by the court or judge thereof.

4. When the decree appealed from is for the foreclosure of a lien,
and also against the person for the amount of the debt secured thereby,
the undertaking shall also be to the effect that the appellant will pay
any portion of such decree, remaining unsatisfied after the sale of the
property, upon which the lien is foreclosed.

W'hen the decree appealed from requires the execution of a conveyance or other ipstmment, execution of the decree is not stayed by the
appeal, unlessfthe instrument is executed and deposited with the clerk,
within the time allowed to file the undertaking, to abide the decree of

the appellate court.

SEC. 529. When the proceedings are stayed, if perishable property
has been seized to satisfy or secure the judgment or decree, or has been
directed to be sold thereby, the court or judge thereof may order the

property to be sold, as if the proceedings were not stayed, and the proeeeds thereof to be deposited or invested to abide the decision of the
appellate court. The court or judge thereof in its discretion may dispense with or limit the further undertaking required by subdivisions 1,
2, 3 and 4 of section 528, when the appellant is an executor, administrator, trustee, or other person acting in another’s right. In cases not

provided for in such subdivisions, when an appeal is perfected, with an

undertaking for the appeal only, proceedings shall be stayed as if the
further undertaking therefor had been given.

SEC. 530. If the judgment or decree has been given in an action or
suit upon a contract, notwithstanding an appeal, and undertaking for
the stay of proceedings, the respondent may proceed to enforce such
judgment or decree, if within ten days from the time the appeal is perfected, he iile with the clerk an undertaking with one or more sureties,
to the effect, that if the judgment or decree be reversed or modiiied,
the respondent will make such restitution as the appellate court may
direct. Such undertaking may be excepted to by the appellant in like
manner and with like effect as the undertaking of an appellant, and
the sureties therein shall have the same qualifications.

SEC. 581. Upon the appeal being perfected, the appellant shall
within twenty days thereafter if the appeal be to the supreme court,
or if to the circuit court within ten days thereafter, file with the clerk
of the appellate court the transcript of the cause, as provided in this section and thereafter the appellate court has jurisdiction of the cause,
and not otherwise.

1. The transcript is a copy, certified by the clerk, of the roll or
iinal record, or the pleadings, orders, papers and journal entries that
constitute such roll or record, together with a copy of the notice of
appeal and any order enlarging the time to file the transcript, and a
statement of the filing of the undertaking, whether by the appellant
or respondent, the names of the sureties therein, the amount thereof
if the same is specified, and if given by the appellant whether the
undertaking is given for an appeal only, or a stay of proceedings also.

2. If the appeal is from a decree, the clerk shall attach together
the depositions and other papers on file in his office, containing the
evidence heard or offered on the trial in the court below, and append
thereto his certificate to that e&'ect, and deliver them to the appellant
with the transcript, taking therefor his receipt in duplicate, one of
which he shall file in his office and deliver the other to the respondent
when so requested. For the purpose of acquiring jurisdiction by the
appellate court, such evidence shall be deemed a part of the transcript,

~ and shall be filed therewith.

3. If the transcript is not filed with the clerk of the appellate
court within the time provided, the appeal is to be deemed abandoned
and the effect thereof terminates, but the court or judge thereof, may
upon notice to the respondent and such terms as may be just, by order

enlarge the time for filing the same, but such order shall be made
within the time allowed to file the transcript, and shall not extend it
beyond the term of the appellate court next following the appeal.

4. If the appeal be abandoned as provided in subdivision 3 of
this section, thereafter the judgment or decree so far as it is for the
recovery of money may be enforced against the sureties in the undertaking for a stay of proceedings as if they were parties to such judgment or decree.

SEC. 532. Then it appears by affidavit to the satisfaction of the
court, that the transcript is incomplete in any particular substantially
affecting the merits of the judgment or decree appealed from, on
motion of the respondent the court shall make a rule upon the clerk
of the court below, requiring him to certify as to such alleged
omission, and if true, to transmit to the appellate court a certified
copy of the pleading, entry, order or other paper, omitted in the
transcript; or, in such case the respondent may move to dismiss the
appeal, and the court shall allow such motion, unless, on the cross
motion of the appellant it makes a rule upon the clerk concerning such
omission as provided in this section upon such terms as may be just.
At any time before the hearing or trial, the court, on motion of the
appellant, may dismiss the appeal; and thereupon the court shall atlirm
the judgment or decree appealed from as a matter of course.

SEC. 533. Upon an appeal from a judgment, the same shall only
be reviewed as to questions of law appearing upon the transcript, and
shall only be reversed or modified for errors substantially affecting the
rights of the appellant; but, upon an appeal from a decree the suit
shall be tried anew upon the transcript and evidence accompanying it.

SEC. 534. Upon an appeal the appellate court may aflirm, reverse,
or modify the judgment or decree appealed from, in the respect mentioned in the notice, and not otherwise; as to any or all of the parties
joining in the appeal, and may include in such decision any or all of
the parties not joining in the appeal, except a co-defendant of the
appellant, against whom a several judgment or decree might have
been given in the court below; and may if necessary and proper order

a new trial.
SEC. 535. Upon an appeal the appellate court may review any

intermediate order involving the merits, or necessarily affecting the
judgment or decree appealed from; and when it reverses or modifies

such judgment or decree may direct complete restitution of all
property and rights lost thereby.

SEC. 536. The decision of the appellate court shall be given and
enforced as provided in this section,

1. Upon an appeal to the supreme court its decision shall be
entered in the journal, and the cause remitted by mandate to the court
below for further proceedings as therein directed. If a new trial be
ordered, upon .the receipt of the mandate by the clerk of the court
below, the decision and order shall be entered in the journal, and
thereafter the cause shall be deemed pending and for trial in such
court, according to the directions of the appellate court.

2. If a new. trial is not ordered, upon the receipt of the mandate
by such clerk,.a judgment or decree shall be entered in the journal
and docketed in pursuance of the direction of the appellate court, in
like manner and with like effect as if the same was given in the court
below.

3. Upon an appealto the circuit court, its decision shall be given,
entered, docketed and enforced in like manner and with like effect as
if the cause had been commenced in that court; unless a new trial is
ordered, in which case, the order may be in the discretion of the court,
either, that the cause be remitted to the court below, or that the new
trial be had in the circuit court.

4. If judgment or decree be given against the appellant, it shall
be entered against his sureties also, in like manner and with like effect,
according to the nature and. extent of their undertaking. An appeal
shall not discharge the lieu of a judgment or decree, and unless the
same be reversed, the lien thereof shall be merged. and continue in the
athrmed or modified judgment or decree given on appeal, from the
time of the entry and docketing of the same in the court below.

SEC. 537. Whenever a judgment or decree is aflirmed on appeal,
and the same be for the recovery of money or personal property or the
value thereof, the judgment or decree shall be given for ten per cent.
on the amount thereof for damages for the delay, unless it appear
evident to the appellate court, that there was probable cause for taking
the appeal.

the commencement thereof, be tendered to the plaintid’ a certain
amount of money in full payment or satisfaction of the cause of
action or suit, and now brings the same into court and deposits it with
the clerk for the plaintiff; if such allegation of tender be found true,

and for the use of the state, or any county or other public corporation
therein, the state, or public corporation shall be liable for and may

such costs shall not be recovered from the state, until after execution
issued therefor against such person and returned unsatisfied in whole

from such liability, by filing an undertaking, at the commencement of

for the payment to the defendant of the costs and disbursements that
may be adjudged to him, executed by one or more suflicient sureties.

SEC. 557. The sureties in such undertaking shall possess the qualifications of sureties in an undertaking for bail on arrest, and their
sufficiency may be excepted by the defendant at any time Within five
days from notice of filing the same, and if so, they shall justify in an
amount not less than two hundred dollars in like manner and with like
effect as such sureties for bail on arrest. Until the time for excepting
to the sufficiency of the sureties has expired, or if excepted to, until
they be found sufiicient the attorney is liable as if no undertaking had
been given. A deposit of two hundred .dollars or other sum, which
the court or judge may direct, with the clerk, may be made in lieu of
such undertaking.

SEC. 558. A sum not exceeding live dollars as costs, may be allowed

to the prevailing party on a motion, in the discretion of the court, and
may be absolute, or directed to abide the event of the action or suit.
In any action suit or proceeding, as to which the allowance and recovery of costs may not be provided for in this title, or elsewhere in this
code; costs may be allowed or not, according to the measure herein

prescribed, and apportioned among the parties in the discretion of
the court.

ofiicer, or person to compel the performance of an act, which the law
specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust _or station.

or person to exercise its or his judgment, or proceed to the discharge
of any of its or his functions, it shall not control judicial discretion.
The writ shall not be issued in any case, where there is a plain, speedy,
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.

SEC. 584. The writ shall be allowed, by the court or judge thereof
upon the petition, verified as a complaint in an action, of the party
beneficially interested. It may be allowed with or without notice to
the adverse party as in the case of a writ of review. Upon the filing
of the petition and order of allowance, the writ shall be issued by the

clerk in accordance therewith.

SEC. 585. The writ shall be directed to the court, corporation, -board
officer or person mentioned or designated in the order of allowance,
and may be served thereon, by any oflicer or person authorized to
serve a summons, by delivery of the original to such oflicer or person,
or to any member of such court, or to any oflicer of such corporation
upon whom this code authorizes a summons to be served. The proof
of service shall be the same as in a writ of review, and obedience to
the writ may be enforced in such manner as the court or judge thereof
shall direct.

SEC. 586. The writ is either alternative or peremptory: when in
the alternative, it shall state concisely the facts, according to the petition, showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and
his omission to perform it, and command him, that immediately after
the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, he do the act
required to be performed, or shew cause before the court or judge
thereof by whom the ,writ was allowed,‘ at a time and place therein
specified, why he has not done so; and that he then and there return
the writ, with his certificate annexed of having done as he is commanded, or the cause of his omission thereof. When peremptory the
writ shall be in a similar form, except that, the words requiring the defendant to shew cause why he hasjnot done as commanded, and to
return the cause therefor, shall be omitted.

SEC. 587. When the right to require the performance of the act is
clear, and it is apparent, that no valid excuse can be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus shall be allowed in the first instance ; in all other cases, the alternative writ shall be first issued.

SEC. 588. On the return day of the alternative writ, or such further
day as the court or judge thereof may allow, the defendant on whom
the writ shall have been served, may show cause by demurrer or answer to the writ, in the same manner as to a complaint in an action.

proof, either in direct denial or by way of avoidance. ‘

SEC. 590. The pleadings in the proceeding by mandamus are those

mentioned in sections 588 and 589, and none other are allowed. They
are to have the same effect, and to be construed and may be amended,
in the same manner as pleadings in an action. Either party may move
to strike out, or be allowed to plead over, after motion or demurrer allowed or disallowed, and the issues joined shall be tried and the further proceedings thereon had in like manner and with like effect as in
an action.

SEC. 591. If judgment be given for the plaintiff he shall recover
the damages which he shall have sustained by reason of the premises,
to be ascertained in the same manner as in an action, together with

costs and disbursements, and a peremptory mandamus shall be awarded
without delay. ‘

SEC. 592. A recovery of damages by virtue of this title against a
party who shall have made a return to a writ of mandamus, is a bar to
any other action or suit against the same party, for the same cause.

SEC. 593. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed to a public officer or body commanding the performance of any public duty,
specially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court or judge thereof
that such oflicer, or any member of such body, has without just excuse, refused or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court
or judge may impose a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars upon
every such officer or member of such body ; and the payment thereof
is a bar to any action for any penalty incurred by such oiiicer or memher, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.

SEC. 594. The circuit court or judge thereof of the county wherein
the defendant, if a public oflicer or body, exercises his or its functions,
or if a private person or corporation, wherein such person resides or
may be found, or such private corporation might be sued in an action,

except that, the supreme court shall have jurisdiction of such proceeding in all cases arising in the state Where it may be necessary or proper
to enable such court to maintain its appellate jurisdiction.

SEC. 595. In the circuit court the writ may be made returnable,
either in term time or vacation, and if the latter, may be tried and determined before the judge thereof in like manner and with like effect
as in term time. In the supreme court, the writ may be allowed by
the court or any judge thereof, but shall only be tried and determined
by the court; and all issues of either fact or law therein, shall be tried
by the court.

SEC. 596. From the judgment of the circuit court or judge thereof
refusing to allow a mandamus, or directing a peremptory mandamus,
an appeal may betaken to the supreme court in like manner and with
like effect as in an action.

SEC. 611. It shall be the duty of the court or judge forthwith to
remand such party, if it shall appear that he is legally detained in custody, either:

1. By virtue of process issued by any court or judge or commissioner or other oiiicer thereof’ ofthe United: States, in a case where

such judge or court or oflicer thereof have conclusive jurisdiction; or

2; By virtueof the judgment or decree of any competent court
of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or of any execution issued upon such
judgment or decree ; or

3. For any contempt, ‘specially and plainly charged in the commitment, by some court, officer or body having authority to commit for
the contempt so charged; and

4. That the time during which such party may be legally
detained has not expired.

SEC. 612. If it appear on the return that the prisoner is in custody
by virtue of an order or civil process of any court legally constituted,
or issued by an officer, in the course of judicial proceedings before him,
authorized by law, such prisoner shall only be discharged in one of the

following cases : _
1. \Vhen the jurisdiction of such court or oiiicer has been

exceeded, either as to matter, place, sum or person; i

2. "When, though the original imprisonment was lawful, yet by
some act, omission or event which has taken place afterwards, the party
has become entitled to be discharged;

3. When the order or -process is defective in some matter of
substance required by law, rendering such process void;

4. When the order or process, though in proper form, has been
issued in a case not allowed by law; I 5. When the person having the custody of the prisoner under
such order or process, is not the person empowered by law to detain
him; or

6. Vv'hen the order or process is not authorized by any judgment
or decree of any court, nor by any provision of law.

SEC. 613. But no court or judge, on the return of a writ of habeas
corpus, has power to inquire into the legality or justice of any order
judgment or process speeitied in section 598, nor into the justice, propriety or legality of any commitment for a contempt made by a court
oflicer or a body, according to law, and charged in such commitment,
as provided in this code.

SEC. 614. If it appear that the party has been legally committed
for a criminal offence, or if he appear by the testimony offered with

the return, or upon the hearing thereof, to be probably guilty of such
offence’; although the commitment be irregular, he shall forthwith be

remanded to the custody, or placed under the restraint from
which he was taken, if the officer or person under Whose custody or
restraint he was, be legally entitled thereto : if not so entitled, he shall
be committed to the custody of the officer or person so entitled.

SEC. 615. Until judgment be given upon the return, the party may
be either committed to the custody of the sheriff of the county or
placed in such care, or under such custody as his age and other circumstances may require.

SEC. 616. When it appears from the return to the writ, that the
party named therein is in custody on an order, or process under which
an other person has an interest in continuing his imprisonment or restraint, no. order shall be made for his discharge, until it shall appear
that the party so interested, or his attorney, shall have had notice of
the time and place at which such writ shall have been made returnable‘.

SEC. 617. When it appears from the return, that the party is imprisoned or restrained on a criminal accusation, the court or judge
shall make no orderfor his discharge until notice of the return is given
to the district attorney of the county, where the party is imprisoned or
restrained.

SEC. 618. The plaintiff in the proceeding on the return of the writ
may, by replication, verified as in an action, controvert any of the material facts set forth in the return, or he may allege therein any fact, to
show, either that his imprisonment or restraint is unlawful, or that he
is entitled to his discharge; and, thereupon, the court or judge shall
proceed in a summary way to hear such evidence as may be produced
in support of . the imprisonment or restraint, or against the same, and
to dispose of the party, as the law and justice of thecase mayrequire.

SEC. 619. The plaintiff may demur to the return, or the defendant
may demur to the .new matter, if any, set forth in the replication of
the plaintiff, or by proof controvert the same, as upon a direct denial
or avoidance. The pleadings herein provided for shall be made Within
such time as the court or judge shall direct, and they shall be construed
and have the same effect as in an action.

SEC. 620. VVhenever from the sickness or infirmity of the party,
he cannot, Without danger, be produced, the oiiicer or person in whose
custody he is, may state that fact in his return to the Writ, and if satisfied of the truth of the allegation, and the return be otherwise suiiicient, the court or judge shall proceed to decide on the return, and to

dispose of the matter in the same manner  if the party had been
produced. '

SEC. 621. If it appear that the party detained is illegally imprisoned
or restrained, judgment shall be given that he be forthwith discharged;
otherwise judgment shall be given that the proceeding be dismissed
and the party remanded. ~

SEC. 622. Notwithstanding the issuing of the writ without requiring the production of the person, the court or judge before whom the
same was returnable, may. before final decision, issue a precept to the
oflicer or other person to whom the writ was directed, requiring the
production of the person.

SEC. 623. Obedience to a judgment, for the discharge of a person
imprisoned or restrained, pursuant to the provisions of this title may
be enforced by the court or judge, by proceedings for a contempt. No
officer or other person is liable to any action or proceeding, for obeying
such judgment of discharge.

SEC. 624. No person who has been iinally discharged, upon a proceeding by habeas corpus, pursuant to the provisions of this title, shall
be again imprisoned, restrained or kept in custodyfor the same cause;
but it is not to be deemed the same cause:

1. If he have been discharged from a commitment on a criminal
charge, and be afterwards committed for the same offence, by the legal
order or process of the court, wherein he is bound, by recognizance
or undertaking to appear, or in which he is indicted or convicted for
the same offence; or

' 2. If, after a judgment of discharge for a defect of evidence, or
for a material defect in the commitment, in a criminal case, the party
he again arrested, on suihcient evidence, and committed by legal
process, for the same offence; or, ,

3. If, in a civil action or suit the party have been discharged for
any illegality in the judgment, decree or process herein before specified,
and be afterwards imprisoned for the same cause of action or suit; or,

5. If, in a civil action or suit, he have been discharged from commitment on a writ of arrest, and be afterwards committed on execution,
in the same action or suit, or on a writ of arrest in another action or
suit, aiter the dismissal of the first one.

SEC. 625. Whenever it appears by satisfactory evidence that any
person is illegally imprisoned or restrained and that there is good reason to believe that he will be carried out of the state or suffer some
irreparable injury before he can be relieved by the issuing of a habeas
corpus, any court or judge authorized to issue such writ, may issue a
warrant reciting the facts, and directed to any sheriff, or other person,
therein designated, commanding such oiiicer or person to take such
person, and forthwith to bring him before such court or judge, to be

dealt with according to law.

SEC. 626. When the proof mentioned in the last section, shall also
be sutiicient to justify an arrest of the person having the party in his
custody, as for a criminal offence, committed in the taking or detaining
of such party, the warrant may also contain an order for the arrest of
such person for such offence.

SEC. 627. Any oliicer or person to whom such warrant shall be

directed, shall execute the same by bringing the party therein named,
and the person who detains him, if so commanded by the warrant, before the court or judge issuing the same; and thereupon the person
detaining such party shall make a return in like manner, and the like
proceedings shall be had thereon as if a writ of habeas corpus had
been issued in the first instance.

SEC. 628. If the person having such party in his custody, be
brought before the court or judge as for a criminal offence, he shall be
examined, committed, bailed or discharged by the court or judge in
like manner as in other criminal cases of the like nature.

SEC. 629. Any oiiicer or other person, refusing to deliver a copy of
any order, warrant, process or other authority, by which he shall detain
any person, to any one who shall demand such copy, and tender the
fees therefor, shall forfeit two hundred dollars to the person so detained.

SEC. 630. Whenever a writ of habeas corpus is required, in any
action, suit or proceeding, civil or criminal, to which the state is a party,
the application therefor may be made by the district attorney having
charge thereof, and whenever so issued, the court or judge shall state
in the order of allowance that it was issued on such application.

SEC. 631. A writ of habeas corpus may be served by the sheriff of
any county in the state,‘ within his county, or by any other person
therein designated in any county within the state, and the service
thereof, shall not be deemed complete, so as to require the prisoner to
be brought up before the court or judge issuing the same, unless the

party serving the same, shall tender to the person in whose custody the

prisoner may be, if such person be a sheriff, or other omcer, the fees
allowed by law for bringing up such prisoner‘; nor unless he shall also
enter into an undertaking to such sheriff, or other ofiicer, as the case
may be, in a penalty double the amount of the sum for which such
prisoner may be detained, 'if he be detained for any specific sum of
money; and if not, then in such a sum as the judge granting the writ
shall direct, not exceeding one thousand dollars, to the effect that such
person shall pay the charges for carrying back such prisoner if he shall
be remanded, and that such prisoner will not escape by the way, either
in going to or returning from the place to which he is to be taken. If
such fees be not paid, or such security be not tendered, the ethcer to
whom the writ is directed, shall make return thereto, in the manner
required by section 604, and shall state therein the reason why such
prisoner is not produced, and thereupon the court or judge granting
the Writ, may proceed as if the prisoner were produced. But this section from and inclusive of the words “and the service thereof,” does
not apply to a case wherein the writ is issued on the application of the
district attorney.

SEC. 632. The writ of habeas corpus may be served by delivery of
the original to the omcer or person to Whom it is directed, or if he
cannot be found by leaving it at the jail or other place in which the
partyis imprisoned or restrained, with any under oilicer or other person having charge for the time of such party.

SEC. 633. If the officer or person on whom the writ ought to be
served, conceal himself, or refuse admittance to the person attempting
to serve it, it may be served by ailixing it in some conspicuous place
on the outside, either of his dwelling house or the jail or other place
where the party is confined.

SEC. 634. It is the duty of every sheriff or other ofiicer upon whom
a. writ of habeas corpus has been served, whether such Writ be directed
to him or not, upon payment or tender of the fees allowed by law, and
the delivery or tender of the undertaking herein prescribed, to obey
and return the writ according to the exigency thereof; and it is the
duty of every other person, upon whom the writ is served, having the
custody of the person, for whose benefit it is‘i‘ssued to obey and return
it in like manner, without requiring the payment of any fees, unless
the payment of such fees has been required by the court or judge
allowing such Writ. ’ '

SEC. 635. Every court or judge allowing a writ of habeas corpus
directed to a person other than a sheriff or other ofiicer, may, in its
discretion, require in order to render the service etfectual, that the
charges of producing the party be paid by the applicant; and in such
case the court or judge shall, in the order allowing the writ, specify
the amount of such charges, which shall not exceed the fees allowed
by law to sheriffs for similar services.

SEC. 636. The proof of service of the writ of habeas corpus shall
be the same as in the service of a summons, except that the same shall
be endorsed upon a copy of the writ made by the oflicer or person
serving it, and returned to the clerk who issued the writ.

SEC. 637. Ifthe writ be returnable at a certain time, such return
shall be made, and the party produced if required, or there be no
valid excuse therefor, as herein provided, at the time and place specitied therein, if it be returnable forthwith, and the place of return be
within twenty miles of the place of service-, the return must be made
and the party produced within twenty-four hours, and the same time
is allowed for every additional twenty miles.

SEC. 638. The circuit court of the judicial district wherein the
party is imprisoned or restrained, shall have exclusive jurisdiction of
the proceeding by habeas corpus herein provided for: except that, the
county court of the county wherein the party is imprisoned. or
restrained, may allow the writ or the warrant in lieu thereof provided for
in section 6:25, and in such case such writ or warrant shall be made
returnable before the circuit court, at the next term thereof for such
county. At any time after the allowance of such writ or warrant by
the county court or judge, the plaintiff therein, or the person applying
therefor on his behalf, may give notice thereof to the judge of such
circuit court, and thereupon if necessary to avoid delay, such judge
shall by order require that the return he made, and the party produced
before him at such ‘time and place within the.dist.rict as may be
convenient.

SEC. 639. Any party to a proceeding by habeas corpus, including
the state when the district attorney appears ‘therein, may appeal from

' the judgment of the circuit court refusing to allow_s11el1 writ, or any
' nnal judgment therein, either in term time or vacation, to the supreme

court, in like manner and with like effect as in an action. No ques- tion once finally determined upon a proceeding by habeas corpus, shall

be re-examined upon another or subsequent proceeding of the same
kind.

SEC. 640. The following acts, or omissions, in respect to a court of
justice, or proceedings therein, are deemed to be contempts of the

authority of the court:
1. Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the

judge ‘While holding the court, tending to impair its authority, or to
interrupt the due course of a trial, or other judicial proceeding;

3. A breach of the peace, boisterous conduct, or violent disturbance, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial
proceeding:

3. Misbehavior in oiiice, or other wilful neglect or violation of
duty, by an attorney, clerk, sheriff, or other person appointed or selected
to perform a judicial or ministerial service;

4. Deceit, or abuse of the process or proceedings of the court, by
a party of an action, suit or special proceeding; '

5. Disobedience of any lawful judgment, decree, order or process of the court;
6. Assuming to be an attorney or other ofiicer of the court, and

acting as such without authority in a particular instance ;
7. Rescuing any person or property in the custody of an oflicer

by virtue of an order or process of such court;
8. Unlawfully detaining a witness orparty to an action, suit or
proceeding, while going to, remaining at, or returning from the court,

Where the same is for trial ;

9. Any other unlawful interference with the process or proceedings of a court;

10. Disobedience of a subpaana duly served, or refusing to be
sworn or answer as a witness; _

11. When summoned as a juror in a court, improperly conversing
with a party to an action, suit or proceeding to be tried at such court,
or with any other person in relation to the merits of such action, suit
or proceeding, or receiving a communication from a party or other
person in respect to it, without immediately disclosing the same to
the court;

12. Disobedience by an inferior tribunal, magistrate, or ofiicer of
the lawful judgment, decree, order or process of a superior court, or
proceeding in an action, suit, or proceeding contrary to law, after such
action, suit or proceeding shall have been removed from the jurisdiction
of such inferior tribunal, magistrate, or officer.

The conduct specined in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this section, when
committed before a judicial ofiicer, or disobedience of the lawful order
or process of such officer, made in the cases specified in section 890, is
also to be deemed a contempt of the authority of such ofiicer.

SEC. 641. Every court of justice, and every judicial ofiicer, has
power to punish contempts: by fine or imprisonment, or both. But
such line shall not exceed three hundred dollars, nor the imprisonment
six months ; and when the contempt is not one of those mentioned in
the first and second subdivisions of the last section, or in the first subdivision of section 890, it must appear that the right or remedy of a
party to an action, suit or proceeding was defeated or prejudiced
thereby, before the contempt can be punished otherwise than by a fine
not exceeding one hundred dollars.

SEC. 642. Then a contempt is committed in the immediate View
and presence of the court or ofiicer, it may be punished summarily, for
which an’ order must be made reciting the facts as occurring in such
immediate view and presence, determining that the person proceeded
against, is thereby guilty of a contempt, and that he be punished as
therein prescribed.

SEC. 643. In cases other than those mentioned in section 642,

before any proceedings can be taken therein, the facts constituting the
contempt must be shown by an affidavit presented to the court or
judicial officer, and thereupon such court or oiiicer, may either make
an order upongthe person charged to show cause why he should not be

arrested to answer, or issue a warrant of arrest to bring such person to
answer in the first instance.

SEC. 644. If the party charged be in the custody of an officer, by
virtue of a legal order or process, civil or criminal, except upon a.
sentence for a felony, an order may be made for the production of such
person by the ofhcer having him in custody, that he may answer and
he shall thereupon be produced and held, until an order be made for

his disposal. _

SEC. 645. In the proceeding for a contempt, the state is the plaintiff. In all cases of public interest the proceeding may be prosecuted
by the district attorney on behalf of the state and in all cases where

the proceeding is commenced, upon the relation of a private party,
such party shall be deemed a co-plaintiff with the state.

SEC. 646. Whenever a warrant of arrest is issued, pursuant to this title, the court or judicial ofiicer shall direct therein, whether the person charged may be let to bail for his appearance upon the warrant, or
detained in custody without bail, and if he may be bailed, the amount
in which he may be let to bail. Upon executing the warrant of arrest,
the sheriff must keep the person in actual custody, bring him before

-the court or judicial ofiicer, and detain him until an order be made in

the premises, unless the person arrested entitle himself to be discharged,
as provided in section 647.

SEC. 647. The defendant shall be discharged from the arrest, upon
executing and delivering to the sheriff, at any time before the return
day of the warrant, an undertaking, with two sufficient sureties, to the
effect that the defendant will appear on such return day, and abide the

order or judgment of the court or ofiieer thereupon, or pay, as may be
directed, the sum specified in the warrant. ‘

SEC. 648. The sheriff shall return the warrant of arrest, and the
undertaking, if any, given him by the defendant, by the return day
therein specified. \Vhen the defendant has been brought up or
appeared, the court or judicial oiiicer, shall proceed to investigate the
charge by examining such defendant, and witnesses for or against him,
for which an adjournment may be had from time to time, if necessary.

SEC. 649. Upon the evidence so taken, the court or judicial ofiicer
shall determine whether or not the defendant is guilty of the contempt
charged, and if it be determined that he is so guilty, shall sentence
him to be punished as provided in this title. 6

SEC. 650. If any loss or injury to a party in an action, suit or proceeding, prejudicial to his rights therein, have been caused by the contempt, the court or judicial otlicer, in addition to the punishment
imposed for‘ the contempt, may give judgment that the party aggrieved recover off the defendant a sum of money sufficient to indemnify him, and to satisfy his costs and disbursements, which judgment,
and the acceptance of the amount thereof, is a bar to any action, suit
or proceeding by the aggrieved party for such loss or injury.’

SEC. 651. When the contempt consists in the omission or refusal
to perform an act which is yet in the power of the defendant to perform, he may be imprisoned until he shall have performed it, and in
such case the act must be specified in the warrant of commitment.

SEC. 652. Persons proceeded against, according to the provisions of
this title, are also liable to indictment for the same misconduct, if it
be an indictable offence, but the court before which a conviction is had
on the indictment in passing sentence, shall take into consideration the
punishment before inflicted.

SEC. 653. When the warrant of arrest has been returned served, if
the defendant do not appear on the return day, the court or judicial
officer may issue another Warrant of arrest, or may order the under-‘
taking to be prosecuted, or both. If the undertaking be prosecuted,
and the aggrieved party join in the action, and the sum specified
therein be recovered; so much thereof as will compensate such party
for the loss or injury sustained by reason of the misconduct for which
the warrant was issued, shall be deemed to be recovered for such party

exclusively.

SEC. 654. Either party to a judgment in a proceeding for a contempt, may appeal therefrom, in like manner, and with like effect as
from a judgment in an action, but such appeal shall not have the effect
to stay the proceeding, in any other action, suit or proceeding, or upon
any judgment, decree or order therein, concerning Which, orfwherein
such contempt was committed. ' Contempts of justices’ courts are
punishable in the manner specially provided in the procedure before

them.

662. Definition of direct evidence.

SEC. 655. Judicial evidence is the‘means, sanctioned by law, of
ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a question of
fact. Proof is the effect of evidence, the establishment of a fact by
evidence.

Sec. 656. The law of evidence which is the subject of this chapter
and chapters IX. and X. is a collection of general rules established by
law :
1. For declaring what is to be taken as true without proof ;

2. For declaring the presumptions of law, both those which are
disputable and those which ‘are conclusive; and ' 3. For the production of legal evidence;
. 4. For the exclusion of whatever is not legal;
5. For deterniining in certain cases the value and effect of
evidence.

SEC. 657. The law does not require demonstration, that is, such a
degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error produces absolute
certainty ; because such proof is rarely possible. Moral certainty only
is required, or that degree of proof, which produces conviction in an
unprejugliced mind. .

SEC. 658. There are four kinds of evidence:

1.. The knowledge of the court;

2. The’ testimony of witnesses;

3. Writings;

4. Other material objects presented to the senses.

SEC. 659. There are ‘several degrees of evidence:

1. Original and secondary ;
2. Direct and indirect;

3. Primary, partial, satisfactory, indispensable and conclusive.

SEC. 660. Original evidence is an original writing or material
object introduced in evidence.

SEC. 661. Secondary evidence is a copy of such-o1fi_ginal',wr_iti.ng or
object or oral evidence thereof.
SEC. 662. Direct evidence is that which proves the fact in ilispute,
directly, without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if
true, conclusively establishes that fact. For example: If the fact in
dispute be an agreement, the evidence of a witness’ who was préisent

and witnessed the making of it, is direct.

SEC. 663. Indirect evidence is that which tends to establish the
fact in dispute by provinganother, and which, though true, does not

of itself, conclusively establish that fact, but which affords an inference or presumption of its existence. For examplei A witness proves
an admission of the party to the fact in dispute. This proves a fact,
from which the fact in dispute is inferred.

SEC. 664. Primary evidence is that, which suffices for the proof of
a particular fact, until contradicted and overcome by other evidence.
For example, the certificate of a recording ofheer  primary evidence
of a record; but it may be afterwards overcome upon proof that there
is no such record.

SEC. 665. Partial evidence is that, which goes to establish a
detached fact, in a series tending to the fact in dispute. It may be
received, subject to be rejected as incompetent, unless connected with
the fact in dispute, by proof of other facts. For example, on an issue
of title to real property, evidence of the continued possession of a
remote occupant is partial, for it is of a detached fact, which may or
may not be afterwards connected with the main fact in dispute.

SEC. 666. That evidence is deemed satisfactory, which ordinarily
produces moral certainty, or conviction in an unprejudiced .mind.
Such evidence alone will justify a verdict. Evidence less than this is
denominated insuiiicient evidence.

SEC. 667. Indispensable evidence is that, without which a particular
fact cannot be proved.

SEC. 668. Conclusive or unanswerable evidence is that, which the
law does not permit to be contradicted. For example, the record
of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be contradicted by the
parties to it.

SEC. 669. Cumulative evidence is additional evidence of the same

character, to the same point.

SEC. 670. Corroborative evidence. is additional evidence of a different character, to the same point.

SEC. 671. The direct evidence of one witness,-who is entitled to
full credit, is suiiieient for proof of any fact, except usage, peljury
and treason.

SEC. 672. A witness can be heard only upon oath or aiiirmation,
and he can testify of those facts only which he knows of his own
knowledge, that is, which are derived from his own perceptions;
except in those few express cases, in which his opinions, or inferences
or the declarations of others, are admissable. I

SEC. 673. A witness is presumed to speak the truth. This presumption, however, may be overcome by the manner in which he
testifies, by the character of his testimony, or by evidence affecting his
character or motives, or by contradictory evidence; and where the
trial is by the jury, they are the exclusive judges of his credibility.

SEC. 674. The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced ‘by the
declaration, act or omission of another, except by virtue of a particular
relation between them.

SEC. 675. Where, however, one derives title, to real property from
another, the declaration, act or omission of the latter, while holding
the title, in relation to, the property is evidence against the former.

SEC. 676. Where, also, the declaration, act or omission, forms part
of a transaction, which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that
fact, such declaration, act or omission, is evidence as part of the
transaction.

SEC. 677. And where the question in dispute between the parties,
is the obligation or duty of a third person, whatever would be evidence
for or against such person, is’ primary evidence between the parties.

SEC. 678. The declaration, act or omission of a member of a family,
who is deceased, or out of the state, is also admissable as evidence of

common reputation, in cases where, on questions of pedigree, such
reputation is admissable.

SEC. 679. The declaration, act or omission of a deceased,,person,
having sutiicient knowledge of the subject, against his pecuniary
interest, is also admissable as evidence to that extent, against his
successor in interest. ,

SEC. 680. When part of an act, declaration, conversation or

writing, is given in evidence by one party, the whole, on the same
subject, may be inquired into by the other; when a letter is read the

answer may be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, eonversation or writing, which is necessary to make it understood, may
also be given in evidence.

SEC. 681. There shall be no evidence of the contents of a writing,
other than the writing itself, except in the following cases: '

1. When the original is in the possession of the party against
whom the evidence is offered, and he withholds it under the circumstances mentioned in section 749;

2. When the original cannot be produced, by the party by whom
the evidence is offered, in a reasonable time, with proper diligence,
and its absence is not owing to his neglect or default;

3. When the original is a- record, or other document, in the
custody of a public oflicer;

4. When the original is a record or other document, of which a
certified copy is expressly made evidence by this code or some other
statute of the state ;

5. VVhen the originals consist of numerous accounts, or other
documents, which cannot be examined in court, without great loss of
time, and the evidence sought from them, is only the general result of
the whole.

In the cases mentioned in subdivisions 3 and 4 a copy of the original
shall beproduced; in those mentioned in subdivisions 1 and 2, either
a copy or oral evidence of the contents.

SEC. 682. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to
writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those
terms, and therefore there can be, between the parties and their
representatives, or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of
the agreement, other than the contents of the writing, except in the
following cases: ‘

1. VVhere a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in
issue by the pleadings;

2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.
But this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances
under which the agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined
in section 686, or to explain an ambiguity, intrinsic or extrinsic, or to
establish illegality or fraud. The term agreement includes deeds "and
wills, as well as contracts between parties.

SEC. 683. The language of awriting is to be interpreted, according
to the meaning it bears in the place of its execution, unless the parties

have reference to a diiferent place.

SEC. 684. In the construction of a statute or instrument, the ofhce

of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare, what is, ‘in terms or in
substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or
to omit what has been inserted; and, where there are several provisions or particulars, such construction is, if possible, to be adopted. as

will give effect to all.

SEC. 685. In the construction of ‘a. ‘statute, the intention of thelegislature, and in the construction of an instrument, the intention of!’

the parties, is to be pursued if possible ; and when. a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former.
So a particular intent shall control a general one, that is inconsistent

with it.

SEC. 686. For the proper construction of an instrument, the circumstances under which it was made, including the situation of the
subject of the instrument, and of the parties to it, may also be shown,
so that the judge be placed in the position of those, whose language
he is to interpret.

SEC. 687. The terms of a writing are presumed.to- have been used
in their primary and general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless
admissible, that they have a. technical, local, or otherwise peculiar
signification, and were so used‘ and understood in the particular
instance, in which case the agreement shall be construed accordingly.

SEC. 688. When an instrument consists partly of written words,
and partly of a printed form, and the two are inconsistent, the former
controls the latter.

SEC. 689. When the characters, in which an instrument is Written,
are difficult to be deeyphered, or the language of the instrument is not
understood by the court, the evidence of persons skilled in decyphering
the characters, or who understand the language, is admissible to declare

the characters or the meaning of the language.

SEC. 690. When the terms of ‘an agreement have been intended‘
in a different sense by the different parties to it, that sense is to prevail,
against either party, in which be supposed the other understood it;
and when different constructions of a provision are otherwise equally

proper, that is to be taken which is most favorable to the party, in
whose favor the provision was made.

SEC. 691. A written notice, is to be construed according to the
ordinary acceptation of its terms. Thus a notice to the drawers or
endorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note, that it has been
protested for want of acceptance or payment, shall be held to import
that the same has been duly presented for acceptance or payment, and
the same refused, and that the holder looks for payment, to the person

to whom the notice is given.

SEC. 692. Where a statutq is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natural right, and the other against it, the
former is to prevail.

SEC. 693. None but a material allegation need be proved.

SEC. 694. Evidence shall correspond with the substance of the
material allegations and be relevant to the questions in dispute. Collateral questions shall therefore be avoided. It is however within the
discretion of the court to permit inquiry into a collateral fact, when
such fact is directly connected with the question in dispute, and is
essential to its proper determination, or when it affects the credibility

of a witness.

SEC. 695. Each party shall prove his own afiirmative allegations.
'Ex'idence need ‘not be given in support of a negative allegation, except
when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of
the right or title, on which the cause of action or defence is founded,

I nor even in such case when the allegation is the denial of the existence

of a document, the custody of which belongs to the adverse party.

Sac. 696. In conformity with the preceding provisions, evidence
may be given on the trial, of the following facts:

1. The precise fact. in dispute; ,

2. The declaration, act or omission of a party as evidence against
sucll party ; _

3. A declaration or act of another, in the presence and within
the observation of a party, and his conduct in relation thereto ;

4. The declaration or act, verbal or written, of a deceased person,
in respect to the relationship, birth, marriage or death of any person
related by blood or marriage to such deceased person ; the declaration
or act of a deceased person, made or done against his interest in respect
to his real property; and also in criminal actions, the declaration or

act of a dying person, made or done under a sense of impending death,
respecting the cause of his death;

5. After proof of a partnership or agency, the declaration or act
of a partner or agent of the party, within the scope of the partnership
or agency, and during its existence; the same rule applies to the declaration or act of a joint owner, joint debtor or other person jointly
interested with-the party;

6. After proof of a conspiracy, the declaration or act of a conspirator against his co-conspirator, and relating to the conspiracy:

7. The declaration, act or omission forming part of the transaction, as explained in section 676. , A

8. The testimony of a witness, deceased, or out of the state, or
unable to testify, given in a former action, suit or proceeding, or trial
thereof between the same parties, relating to the same matter":

9. The opinion of a witness respecting the identity or handwriting of a person, when he has knowledge of the person or handwriting; his opinion on a question of -science, art or trade, when he is
skilled therein; . i

10. The opinion of a subscribing witness to a writing, the validity
of which is in dispute, respecting the mental sanity of the signer, and
the opinion of an intimate acquaintance, respecting the mental sanity
of a person, the reason for the opinion being given;

11. Common reputation, existing previous to the controversy,
respecting facts of a public or general interest, more than thirty years

old, and in cases of pedigree and boundary;
12. Usage, to explain the true character of an act, contract or

instrument, where such true character is not otherwise plain, but .

usage is never admissable except as a means of interpetration; . p . p

13. Monuments and inscriptions in public places, as evidence of
common reputation, and entries in family bibles or other family books
or charts, engravings on rings, family portraits, and the like as evidence of pedigree; ' _

14. The contents of a writing when oral evidence thereof is
admissable; ,

15. Any other facts from which the facts in issue are presumed,

or are logically inferrable;
16. Such facts as arve to shew the credibility of’ a witness, as

explained in section 673.

TITLE II.

SIC. 697. Certain facts, sssumedto be true. I 698. Specification of such facts.

SEC. 697. There are certain facts of such general notoriety, that
they are assumed to be already known to the court. Of those facts
evidence need not be produced. ' '

SEC. 698. The following facts are assumed to be thus known:

Sec. 700. All persons without exception, except as otherwise

a person cannot be examined as a Witness in the following cases:

‘I. A husband shall not be examined, for or against his wife,
without her consent, nor a wife, for or against her husband, Without
his consent, nor can either, during the marriage or afterwards, be,

SEC. 708. Every public oflicer, having the custody of a public
Writing, which a citizen has a right to inspect, is bound to give him on
demand, a certified copy of it, on payment of the legal fees therefor,
and such copy is primary evidence of the original writing.

SEC. 709. Public Writings are divided into four classes:
1. Laws;
2. Judicial records; .

3. Other oflieial documents;
4. Public records, kept in this state, of private Writings;

SEC. 710. Laws Whether organic or ordinary, are either written or
unwritten.

SEC. 711. A written law is that which is promulgated in writing,
and of which a record is in existence.

SEC. 712. The organic law is the constitution of the United States
and of this state, and is altogether written. Other written laws are
denominated statutes. The written law of this state is therefore contained in its constitution and statutes, and in the constitution and
statutes of the United States.

SEC. 713. Statutes are public or private. A private statute, is one
which concerns only certain designated persons, and affects only their

private rights. All other statutes are public, in which are included,
statutes creating or affecting corporations.

SEC. 714. Unwritten law is the law not promulgated and recorded,
as mentioned in section 711, but which is nevertheless observed and
administered in the courts of the state. It has no certain repository ;

but is collected from the reports of the decisions of courts and the
treatises of learned men.

SEC. 715. Books, printed or published, under the authority of a

sister state, or foreign country, and purporting to contain the statutes,
code, or other written law, of such state or country, or proved to be
commonly‘ admitted in the tribunals of such state, or country, as
evidence of the written law thereof, are admissible in this state, as

evidence of such law.

SEC. 716. The public seal of the state or county, afiixed to a copy
of a Written law, is also admissible as evidence of such law or writing.

SEC. 717. The oral testimony of witnesses skilled. therein, is
admissible as evidence of the unwritten law, of a sister state or foreign
country, as are also printed and published books of reports ofdeeisions
of the courts of such state, or country, or proved to be commonly
admitted in such courts.

SEC. 718. The recitals in a public statute, are conclusive evidence of
the facts recited for the purpose of carrying it into effect, but no
further. The recitals in a. private statute, are conclusive - evidence of
the facts recited, between parties who claim under its provisions, but

nocfurther.

SEC. 719. A judicial record, is the record, official entry or files of
the proceedings in a court of justice, or of the oiiicialact of a judicial
officer, in an action, suit or proceeding.

SEC. 720. A judicial record of this state or of the United States,
may be proved by the production of the original, or by aeopy thereof,
certified by the clerk, or other person having the legal custody thereof,
with the seal of the court afiixed thereto, if there be a seal. That of
a sister state may be proved by the production of a copy thereof,
certified by the clerk or other person having the legal custody of the
record, with the seal of the court affixed thereto, if there be a. seal,
together with the certificate of the chief judge, or presiding magistrate
that the certificate is in due form and made by the clerk or other
person having the legal custody of the original.

SEC. 721. A judicial record of a foreign country, may be proved
by the production of a copy thereof, certified by the clerk or other
person having the legal custody of the record, with the seal of the
court afiixed thereto, if there be a seal, together with the certificate of
the chief judge, or presiding magistrate that the certificate is in due
form and made by the clerk or other person having the legal custody
of the original, and also, together with the certificate of tlie Secretary
of State or other officer of the government, having the custody of the

great or principal seal of such government, to the effect that the court
or oflicer, whose judicial act or proceeding is certified, had jurisdiction
to perform the same, specifying generally the nature of the jurisdiction
and verifying the signature of the clerk or other legal keeper of the
record, and also the signature of the chief judge or presiding
magistrate.

SEC. 722. A copy of the judicial record of a foreign country is

also admissible in evidence upon proof:
1. That the copy offered has been compared by the witness with

the original, and is an exact transcript of the whole of it;

2. That such original was in the custody of the clerk or other
legal keeper of the same ; and

3. That the copy has affixed to it a seal, which is proved to be
the seal of the court Where the original record remains, or if there be
no such seal, the signature of the legal keeper of the record.

SEC. 723. The effect of a judgment, decree or final order, in an
action suit or proceeding, before a court or judge thereof of this state
or of the United States, having jurisdiction to pronounce the same, is
as follows : _

1. In case of a judgement, decree, or order, against a specific
thing, or in respect to the probate of a will or the administration of
the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political,
or legal condition or relation of a particular person, the judgment,
decree, or order, is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or
administration, or the condition or relation of the person ;

2. In other cases, the judgment, decree, or order is, in respect to
the matter directly determined conclusive between the parties and
their representatives and successors in interest by title subsequent to
the commencement of the action suit or proceeding, litigating for the
same thing, under the same title, and in the same capacity.

SEC. 724. Other judicial orders of a court or judge thereof of this
state or of the United States, create a disputable presumption concerning the matter directly determined, between the same parties and their
representatives and successors in interest by title subsequent to the
commencement of the action suit or proceeding, litigating for the same
thing, under the same title, and in the same capacity. .

SEC. 725. The parties are deemed to be the same, when those,
between whom the evidence is offered, were adverse to each other in

the former case, and a judgment, decree or other determination, could
in that case have been made between them alone, though other parties
were joined with both oreithcr. ‘

SEC. 726. That only is deemed to have been determined by a
former judgment, decree or order, which appears upon its face to have
been so determined, or which was actually and necessarily included
therein, or necessarily thereto.

SEC. 727. Wlienever, pursuant to the last four sections a party is
bound by a record, and such party stands in the relation of surety for
another, the latter is also bound, from the time that he has notice of
the action suit or proceeding, and a request from the surety to defend

against the same.

SEC. 728. The effect of a judicial record of a sister state, is the
same in this state as in the state where it was made, except that it can
only be enforced here by an action, suit or proceeding, and except
also, that the authority of a guardian or committee, or of an executor
or administrator, does not extend beyond the jurisdiction of the government, under which he Was invested with his authority.

SEC. 729. The effect of the judicial record of a. court of admiralty
of a foreign country, is the same as if it were the record of a court of
admiralty of the United States.

SEC. 730. The effect of the judgment, decree or final order of any
other tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to pronounce
the same, is as follows :

1. In case of a judgment, decree or order against a specific
thing, the same is conclusive, upon the title to the thing;

2. In case of a judgment, decree or order against a person, the
same creates a. disputable presumption of a right, as between the.
parties, and their representatives -and successors in interest by title
subsequent, and can only be overcome by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake
of law or fact.

SEC. 731. Any judicial record may be impeached, and the presumption arising therefrom overcome, by evidence of a want of jurisdiction in the court or judicial oiiicer, or collusion between the
parties, or of fraud in the party offering the record, in respect to the
proceedings.

SEC. 732. The jurisdiction suilicient to sustain a record, is jurisdiction over the cause, over the parties, and over the thing when a specific
thing is the subject of the determination.

SEC. 733. Other official documents may be proved as follows:

1. Acts of the executive or administrative departments of this
state and of the United States by the records of such departments,
certified by the heads thereof respectively; they may also be proved
by public documents, prepared or printed by order of the legislative
assembly, or Congress, or either house thereof;

2. The proceedings of the legislative assembly of this state, or
of Congress, by the journals of those bodies respectively, or either
house thereof‘, or by statutes or resolutions, published by their order,

sovereign thereof, or by a recognition thereof, in or by some public act
of the executive of the United States;

5. Acts of a public corporation of this state, or of a board or
department thereof, by a copy certified -by the legal keeper thereof, or

by a printed copy published by the authority of such corporation or
department thereof.

6. Documents of any other-class in this state, or the United
States, by the original, or by a -copy certified by the legal keeper
thereof. . »

7. Documents of any other class in a sister state, by the original
or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, together with the
certificate of the Secretary. of State, judge of a court of record or
mayor of a city, of such state, that the copy is duly certified by the
officer having the legal custody of the original;

8. Documents of any other class in a foreign country, by the
original, or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, together
with a certificate under the great or principal seal of the country or

having the legal custody of the original.

SEC. 734. A public record of a private writing, may be proved by
the original record, or, by a copy thereof certiiied by the legal keeper
of the record. '

SEC. 735. Entries in public, or other oflicial books or records,
made in the performance of his duty, by a public oilieer of this state,
or of the United States, or by another person in the performance of a
duty specially enjoined by the law of either, are primary evidence of
the facts stated therein.

SEC. 736. A transcript from the record or docket of a justice of
the peace of a sister state, of a judgment given by him, of the
proceedings in the action or proceeding before the judgment, and
subsequent thereto, if any, verified in the manner prescribed in the
next section, is primary evidence of the facts stated therein.

SEC. 737. There shall be attached to the transcript, a certificate of
the justice, having the legal custody of the record or docket, that the
transcript is in all respects correct and complete, and that the justice
who gave the judgment had jurisdiction of the action, together with
the certiheate of the clerk of the county, having official cognizance of
the fact, in which the justice resided at the time of giving the judgment, under the seal of his ofliee, that the person certifying the
transcript was at the date thereof a justice of the peace in the county,
and that the signature is genuine. ‘

SEC. 738. VVhenever a copy of a writing is certified to be used as
evidence, the certificate shall state that the copy has been compared
by the cl:-rtifying oflicer with the original, and that it is a correct
transcript therefrom, and of the whole of such original, or of a
specified part thereof. The ofiicial seal, if there be any, of the certifying officer, shall also be affixed to such certificate or any other
certificate except when the certificate of a clerk of a court is used in
the same court or before an oilicer thereof.

SEC. 739. The provisions of this title, applicable to the public
writings of a sister state, are in like manner applicable to the public
writings of the District of Columbia or a territory of the United
States.

SEC. 740. Private writings are either,
1. Sealed; or
2. Unsealed.

SEC. 741. A seal is a particular sign, made to attest in the most
formal manner, the execution of an instrument.

SEC. 742. A public seal in this state is a stamp or impression made
upon Wax, wafer, paper, or any other like substance, upon which a
visible and permanent impression can be made. A private seal may
be made in the same manner, or it may be made without an impression, by a Wafer or Wax attached to the instrument, or by a paper
attached to it by an adhesive substance. A scroll or other sign made
in a sister state, territory of the United States, district of Columbia or
a foreign country, and there recognized as a seal, shall be so regarded
in this state, except so far as the same may affect any interest in real
property, in this state.

SEC. 743. The seal afiixed to a writing is primary evidence of a consideration. In other respects there is no difference between sealed or
unsealed writings, except as to the time of commencing actions or suits
thereon. A writing under seal may therefore be modified, or discharged, by a writing not under seal or by an oral agreement otherwise valid.

SEC. 744. The execution of a writing is the subscribing and
delivering it, with or without aiiixing a seal.

SEC. 745. An agreement in Writing, without a seal, for the compromise or settlement of a debt or controversy, is as obligatory, as if a’

seal were atiixed.

SEC. 746. The last three sections shall not be construed to dispense
with a seal to a deed or other writing, where the same is required by
any statute of this state.

SEC. 747. A subscribing witness, is one who sees a writing executed,
or hears it acknowledged, and at the request of the party, thereupon
signs his name-as a witness.

SEC. 748. Historical works, books of science or art, and published
maps or charts, when made by persons indifferent between the parties,
are primary evidence of facts of general notoriety and interest.

SEC. 749. The original writing shall be produced and proved except
as provided in section 681. If the writing be in the custody of the
adverse party he must first have reasonable notice to produce it. If he
then fail to do so, the contents of the writing may be proved as in case
of its loss. But the notice to produce it, is not necessary where the
writing itself is a notice, or where it has been wrongfully obtained or
withheld by the adverse party.

SEC. 750. Though a Writing, called for by one party, is produced
by the other, and is thereupon inspected by the party calling for it, he
is not obliged to offer it as evidence in the case.

SEC. 751. If there be a subscribing witness to a writing, offered in
evidence, its execution shall be proved by him, if he be living and
within the state, and can testify. If there be more than one subscribing witness the evidence of one is sufiicient. If all the subscribing
witnesses be dead, or out of the state, or incapable of testifying, the
handwriting of one of them, and that of the party shall be proved.

SEC. 752. If the subscribing witness denies, or does not recollect,
the execution of the writing, its execution may then be proved by
other evidence.

SEC. 753. VVhere however, evidence is given that the party, against
whom the writing is offered, has at any time admitted its execution,
no other evidence of the execution need be given, if the instrument
be one mentioned in section 756, or one produced from the custody of
the adverse party, and has been acted upon by him as genuine.

SEC. 754. The handwriting of a person may be shown, by any one

who believes it to be his, and who has seen him write, or has seen
writing purporting to have been his, upon which he has acted or been
charged, and who has thus acquired a knowledge of his hand writing.

SEC. 755. Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given,
by a comparison, made by a witness skilled in such matters, or the
jury, with writings, admitted or treated as genuine by the party
against whom the evidence is offered.

SEC. 756. VVhen a writing" is more than twenty years old, the
comparision may be made with writings, purporting to be genuine,
and generally respected and acted upon as such, by persons having an
interest in knowingthe fact.

SEC. 757. The entries or other writings of a like character of a
person deceased, or without the state, made at or near the time of the
transaction, and in a positioif to know the facts stated therein, may be
read, as primary evidence of the facts stated therein, in the following
cases:

1. When the entry was made against the interest of the person
making it; or _

2. “Then it was made in a professional capacity, and in the
ordinary course of professional conduct; or

3. VVhen it was made in the performance of a duty specially
enjoined by law.

SEC. 758. Then an entry is repeated, in the regular course of

business, one being copied from another, at or near the time of the
transaction, all the entries are equally regarded as originals.

SEC. 759. Whenever an object, cognizable by _‘the senses, has such a
relation to the fact in dispute, as to afford reasonable grounds of belief
respecting it, or to make an item in the sum of the evidence, such
object may be exhibited to the jury, or its existence, situation and
character may be proved by witnesses. The exhibition of such object

to the jury shall be rugulated by the sound discretion of the court.

TITLE VII.

Indirect eviclence ; inferences and presumptions.

propensities or passions of the person whose act is in question, the
course of business, or the course of nature.

may be overcome by other evidence, direct or indirect; but unless so
overcome, the jury are bound to find according to the presumption.

such opportunity it may be used as evidence with like effect.

8. Any other presumption which by statute, is expressly made
conclusive.

SEC. 766. All other presumptions are satisfactory, unless overcome.
They are denominated disputable presumptions, and may be controverted by other evidence. The following are of that kind:

1. That a person is innocent of crime or wrong;

2. A That an unlawful act was done with an unlawful intent;

3. That a person intends the ordinary consequence of his
voluntary act.

delivery to the purchaser, and every assignment of such property, by
way of mortgage or security, or upon any condition Whatever, unless

SEC. 783. A sheriif, his deputy, or some person specially appointed

SEC. 787. Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be sworn, or
to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an aflidavit or deposition when
required, may be punished as a contempt by the court or oiiicer before

witness be a party, his complaint, answer or reply may be stricken out.

SEC. 788. A witness disobeying a subpcnna duly served shall also

tends.

SEC. 820. The order of proof shall be regulated by the sound discretion of the court. Ordinarily the party, beginning the case, shall
exhaust his evidence before the other begins. '

SEC. 821. If either party require it, the judge may exclude from the
court room any witness of the adverse party not at the time under
examination, so that he may not hear the testimony of other witnesses.

SEC. 822. When a witness does not understand and speak the English language, an interpreter shall be sworn to interpret for him.

SEC. 828. The court may exercise a reasonable control over the
mode of interrogation, so as to make it as rapid, as distinct, as little
annoying to the witness, and as effective for the extraction of the truth,
as may be, but subject to this rule, the parties may put such legal and
pertinent questions as they see tit. The court, however, may stop the
production of further evidence, upon any particular point, when the
evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reasonable doubt.

SEC. 824. The examination of a witness by the party producing
him, is denominated the direct examination ; the examination of the
same witness, upon the same matter, by the adverse. party, the ('I‘()ssexamination. The direct cxamination, must be completed before the
cross-examination begins, unless the court otherwise direct.

SEC. 825. A question which suggests to the witness the answer
which the examining party desires, is denominated a leading or suggestive question. ()n a direct examination, leading questions are not
allowed, unless merely formal or preliminar ’, except in the sound diseretion of the court, under special circumstances, making it appear
that the interests of justice require it.

SEC. 826. A witness is allowed to refresh his memory, respecting
a fact, by anything written by himself, or under his direction, at the
time when the fact occurred or immediately thereafter, or at any other
time when the fact was fresh in his memory, and he knew that the
same was correctly stated in the writing. But in either case the writing
must be produced, and may be inspected by the adverse party, who
may, if he choose, cross-examine the witness upon it, and may read it
to the jury. So also, a witness may testify from such a writing,
though he retain no recollection of the particular facts; but such

evidence shall be received with caution.

SEC. 827. The adverse party may cross-examine the witness, as to
any matter stated in his direct examination, or connected therewith,
and in so doing, may put leading questions, but if he examine him, as
to other matters, such examination is to be subject to the same rules as

a direct examination.

SEC. 828. The party producing a witness, is not allowed to impeach
his credit by evidence of bad character, but he may contradict him by
other evidence, and may also show that he has made at other times
statements inconsistent with his present testimony, as provided in section 830.

SEC. 829. A witness once examined, shall not be re-examined as to
the same matter, without leave of the court; but he may be re-examined as to any new matter, upon which hehas been examined by the
adverse party. After the examinations on both sides are concluded,
the witness shall not be recalled without leave of the court. Leave is
granted or withheld, in the exercise of a sound discretion.

SEC. 830. A witness may be impeached by the party against whom
he was called, by contradictory evidence, or by evidence that his general reputation for truth is bad, or that his moral character is such as
to render him unworthy of belief, but not by evidence of particular
wrongful acts ; except that it may be shewn by the examination of the
witness, or the record of the judgment, that he has been convicted

of a crime.
SEC. 831. A witness may also be impeached, by evidence that he

has made, at other times, statements inconsistent with his present testimony; but before this can be done, the statements must be related

to him, with the circumstances of times, places, and persons present;
and he shall be asked whether he has made such statements, and if so,
allowed to explain them. If the statements be in writing, they shall
be shown to the witness, before any question is put to him
concerning them.

SEC. 832. Evidence of the good character of a party, is not admissible in a civil action, suit or proceeding, unless the issue therein
involve his character, nor of a witness in any action, suit or proceeding
until the character of such witness has been impeached.

SEC. 833. Whenever a writing is shewn to a witness it may be
inspected by the adverse party, and if proved by the witness, shall be
read to the jury before his testimony is closed, or it shall not be read,
except on recalling the witness.

SEC. 834. The judge himself or any juror may be called as a witness
by either party, but in the former case it is in the discretion of the
court or judge to order the trial to be postponed or suspended, and
to take place before another judge.

TITLE IX.
Of the cfect of evidence.

SIC. 835. Jury, judges of the effect. of evidence, to be instructed on certain points.

SEC. 835. The jury subject to the control of the court in the cases
specified in this code, are the judges of the effect or value of evidence
addressed to them, except when it is thereby declared to be conclusive.
They are however to be instructed by the court, on all proper
occasions : g

1. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not
arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discretion, and in subordination
to the rules of evidence.

2. That they are not bound to iind in conformity with the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do not produce conviction in
their minds, against a less number, or against a presumption or other
evidence satisfying their minds;

3. That a witness, false in one part of his testimony, is to be
distrusted in others ;

4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with

distrust, and the oral admissions of a party with caution ;
5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue shall be proved,

and when the evidence is contradictory, the finding shall be according
to the preponderance of evidence; that in criminal cases, guilt shall

shall be established beyond reasonable doubt.
6. That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its own intrinsic

weight, but also according to the evidence which it is in the power of
one side to produce, and of the other to contradict, and therefore,

7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered, when
it appears that stronger and more satisfactory was within the power of
the party, the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust.

SEC. 836. It is the duty of a witness, duly served with a subpoena,
to attend at the time appointed, with any papers, books, documents,

or other thing under his control, required by the subpcena, to answer
all pertinent and legal questions, and unless sooner discharged, to
remain till the testimony is closed. But a witness at the end of each

day’s attendance, may demand of the party or his attorney the payment of his legal fees for the next following day, and if not then paid,
he is not obliged to remain longer in attendance.

SEC. 837. A witness shall answer questions legal and pertinent to
the matter in issue, though his answer may establish a claim against
himself. But he need not give an answer, which will have a direct
tendency to subject him to punishment for a felony, or to degrade his
character, unless, in the latter case, it be as to the very fact in issue,
or to a fact from which the fact in issue would be presumed. This
privilege is the privilege of the witness, and the objection cannot be
made by a party or his attorney; but a witness must answer as to the

fact of his previous conviction for felony. _
SEC. 838. It is the right of a witness to be protected from irrelevant,

insulting or improper questions, and from harsh or insulting demeanor;
to be detained only so long as the interests of justice require it; to be
examined only as to matters legal and pertinent to the issue.

SEC. 839. Every person who has been in good faith, served with a
subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge, commissioner,
referee or other oiiicer, is exonerated from arrest, in a civil case, while
going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and
returning therefrom. The arrest of a witness contrary to this section
is void, and when wilfully made is a contempt of the court; and the
oiiicer making it, is responsible to the witness arrested, for double the
amount of the damages which may be assessed against him therefor,
and is also liable to an action at the suit of the party serving the witness with the subpmna, for the damages sustained by him in
consequence of the arrest.

SEC. 840. But the ofiicer making the arrest is not liable in any way
therefor, unless the person claiming the exemption make, if required,
an aflidavit, stating:

I. That he has been served with a subpcnna, to attend as a witness
before a court, judge or other oflicer, specifying the same, the place of
attendance, and the action, suit, or proceeding in which the subpoena
was issued; and,

2. That he has not been thus served by his own procurement,
with the intention of avoiding an arrest.

The afiidavit may be taken by the oflicer, and exonerates him from
liability for not making the arrest or for discharging the witness when
_arrested.

SEC. 841. The court, judge or ofiicer, before whom the attendance

of the witness is required, may discharge a witness from an arrest
made in violation of section 839. ‘

SEC. 842. An offer in writing, to pay a particular sum of money,
or to deliver a written instrument or specific personal property, is, if
not accepted, equivalent to the actual production, and tender of the
money, instrument or property.

SEC. 843. Whoever pays money or delivers an instrument or
property, is entitled to a receipt therefor, from the person to whom the
payment or delivery is made, and may demand a proper signature to
such receipt as a condition of the payment or delivery.

SEC. 844. The person to whom a tender is made, shall at the time
specify any objection he may have to the money, instrument or property, or he must be deemed to have waived it; and if the objection be
to the amount of money, the terms of the instrument, or the amount
or kind of property, he must specify the amount, terms or kind which
he requires, or be precluded from objecting afterwards.

SEC. 845. The following are the rules, for construing the
descriptive part of a conveyance of real property, when the construction is doubtful, and there are no other sutlicient circumstances
to determine it:

1. Where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars
in the description, the addition of others, which are indefinite,
unknown, or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be

construed by such particulars, if they constitute a suiiicient description, to ascertain its application.

2. When permanent and visible, or ascertained boundaries or
monuments, are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines,
angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount;

3. Between different measurements, which are inconsistent with
each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that
of lines paramount to both ;

4. When a road or a stream of water not navigable, is the
boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the
thread of the stream, are included in the conveyance, except where
the road or bed of the stream is held under another title;

5. When tide water is the boundary, the rights of the grantor
to low Water mark are included in the conveyance, and also the right
of this state between high and low Water mark;

6. When the description refers to a map, and that reference is
inconsistent with other particulars, it controls them, if it appear that
the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise the map is
subordinate to other definite, and ascertained particulars.

SEC. 846. An oifer of compromise is not an admission that anything is due, but admissions of particular facts, made in negotiation

for compromise, may be proved, unless otherwise specially agreed at
the time.

SEC. 847. In a suit for the dissolution of the marriage contract on
the ground of adultery, a confession of adultery, whether in or out of
the pleadings, is not of itself sufficient to justify a decree of dissolution.

TITLE II.
Proceedings to perpetuate testimony.

848. Evidence may be perpetuated. 85?. Papers filed with deposition, primary

SEC. 848. The testimony of a witness may be taken conditionally
and perpetuated, as provided in this title.
SEC. 849. The order for taking ‘the testimony may be made by any

judge of the circuit or supreme courts upon the application of the
party desiring it, when it appears from the petition of such party
verified as a complaint:

1. That the applicant is a party or expects to be a party to an
action, suit or proceeding in a court in this state, or that he has an
interest i11 real property or some easement or franchise therein, about
which a controversy may arise, which would be the subject of such an
action, suit or proceeding;

2. That the testimony of a witness, whose name and place of
residence is stated, is material to the prosecutionor defence as the case
may be, of such action, suit or proceeding, or possible controversy, and
generally the question involved therein, and the facts expected to be
proved by the witness

3. The names and residence of the adverse parties or persons
adversely interested, so far as the applicant knows or can ascertain them.

The judge may thereupon in his discretion make an order, allowing
the examination, prescribing therein the place thereof, and how long
before the examination the order and notice of the time and place
therefor shall be served.

SEC. 850. If it appear that the adverse parties or persons adversely
interested or any of them reside out of the state or are unknown, the
judge shall direct, that as to such parties or persons, service of the
order and notice shall be made by publication, in the same manner as
a summons. Upon proof of the service, the deposition may be taken

conditionally, by the judge who made the order of examination, or by
any other officer or person therein designated.

SEC. 851. Every interrogatory or answer or declaration of the witness shall be taken down, unless the parties otherwise agree. The
deposition, when completed, shall be carefully read to, and subscribed
by the witness, and then certified by the judge or other oiiicer or person taking the same, and immediately thereafter filed in the oflice of
the clerk of the county where it was taken together with the order for
the examination of the witness, the petition on which the same was
granted, the notice, and the proof of service of the order and notice.

SEC. 852. The papers filed with the deposition as required by the
last section, or certified copy thereof, are primary evidence of the facts
stated therein, to show compliance with the provisions of this title.

SEC. 858. If t.hercafter a trial be had, between the persons named

in the petition as parties actual, expectant, or possible, or their representatives or successors in interest, upon proof of the death or insanity
of the witness, or that he is beyond the state and his residence
unknown, or of his inability to attend the trial by reason of age, sickness, or settled infirmity, the deposition or a certified copy thereof,
may be given in evidence by either party, but in a trial in a suit in
equity it may be given in evidence without such proof.

SEC. 854. The deposition so taken, when produced in evidence

thereafter come into the county ;

a. \\''hen real property, devised by the testator, is situated in the

county, and no other county court has gained jurisdiction, under
either of the preceding subdivisions of this section.

SEC. 1052. When a will is proven, letters testamentary shall be
issued to the persons therein named as executors, or to such of them
as give notice of their acceptance of the trust and are qualified. If all
the persons therein named decline to accept or be disqualified, letters
of administration with the will annexed shall be issued to the person,
to whom the administration would have been granted, if there had

been no will.

SEC. 1053. Administration of the estate of an intestate shall be
granted by the county court, authorized to take proof of a will,

SEC. 1054. The persons named in the subdivisions of the last section, if qualified and competent for the trust, shall be entitled to the
administration in the order therein named. If those named in subdivision 1 do not apply for the administration within thirty days from
the decease of the intestate, they shall be deemed to have renounced
their right thereto, but the court or judge thereof in its discretion may,
if they reside within the county, direct that a citation issue to them,
requiring them within such period to apply for or renounce their right

of administration; and if the persons named in subdivision 2 do not

make such application within forty days from such decease, they shall
be deemed to have renounced their right to the administration also.

SEC. 1055. If the deceased were a married woman, the administration of her estate, shall in all cases be granted to her husband, if

such, until he shall file with the clerk an undertaking, with one or
more sutlicient sureties, in a sum not less than twice the probable value

or judge thereof may appoint a special administrator, to take charge
of the estate; who shall qualify in like manner, and have the powers
and perform the duties of an administrator generally, except that he is
not authorized to pay the debts of, or otherwise discharge any obligation against the deceased. Upon the issuing of letters testamentary or
of administration, the powers of the special administrator cease.

been issued thereon, such will should be set. aside, declared void, or
inoperative, such letters shall be revoked, and letters of administration
issued.

SEC. 1062. Any heir, legatee, devisee, creditor, or other person
interested in the estate, may apply for the removal of an executor or
administrator, who has become of unsound mind, or been convicted
of any felony, or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or who

SEC. 1064. Whenever the amount of an exeeutor’s or administrator’s
undertaking is insutlicient, or the sureties therein, or either of them,

give a new and suflicient undertaking. The application for such new
undertaking may be made by any heir, legatee, devisee, creditor, or
other person interested in the estate, and in the manner prescribed in section 1062, for the removal of executors and administrators.

account of their principal, arising from his acts or omissions subsequent thereto. Wlien a new undertaking is ordered, if the executor

he shall be deemed removed and his letters revoked.

or be removed, if there be a co-executor or administrator, he shall
thenceforward exercise the powers and perform the duties of the trust;

removed, administration of the estate remaining unadministered, shall
be granted to those next entitled, if they be competent and qualiiied.

show cause why he should not be removed, and if he fail to appear, or
to show sufhcient cause, an order shall be made removing him and
revoking his letters; and it is the duty of the court or judge thereof
to exercise a supervisory control over an executor or administrator, to
the end, that he faithfully and diligently perform the duties of his

liabilities of the partnership.

SEC. 1070. After the inventory is taken the partnership property
shall be in the custody and control of the executor or administrator for
the purposes of administration, unless the surviving partner shall,

same effect as the undertaking of a general administrator.

or administrator of a deceased partner, shall exhibit and give information concerning the property of the partnership at the time of the

and the sum appearing then to be due thereon.

SEC. 1082. Before the inventory is filed, the property therein specified, shall be appraised at its true cash value, by three disinterested and
competent persons, who shall be appointed by the court or judge
thereof; but if any part of the propert_v shall be in a county, other
than that where the administration is granted, the appraisers thereof

may be appointed by such court or judge, or the court or judge thereof
of the county Where the property shall be ; in the latter case a certified
copy of the order of appointment, shall be filed with the inventory.

SEC. 1083. Before making the appraisement, the appraisers shall
each take and subscribe, an aflidavit, to be tiled with the inventory, to
the effect, that he will honestly and impartially appraise the property
which shall be exhibited to him, according to the best of his knowledge and ability.

SEC. 1084. The appraisers shall appraise each article of property
separately, and set down the value thereof in dollars and cents, opposite the entry of the article in the inventory. Money, of whatever
nature, that is a legal tender, is to be appraised at its nominal value;
but debts of all descriptions or kinds are to be appraised at that sum,
which in the judgment of the appraisers, may be realized from them,

by due process of law. When the appraisement is completed, the
inventory shall be signed by the appraisers.

SEC. 1085. The naming any one executor in a will, shall not
operate to discharge such executor from any claim which the testator
had against him, but the claim shall be included in the inventory, and,
if the person so named, afterwards take upon himself the administration of the estate, he shall be liable for such claim as for so much
money in his hands at the time the claim became due and payable,
otherwise he is liable for such claim as any other debtor of the deceased.

SEC. 1086. The discharge or bequest in a will, of any claim of the .

testator against a person named as executor therein, or against any
other person, shall as against the creditors of the deceased be invalid.
Such claim shall be included in the inventory, and for all the purposes
of administration, is to be deemed and treated as a specific legacy of
that amount.

SEC. 1087. If after the filing of the inventory, property not mentioned therein shall come to the knowledge or possession of the
executor or administrator, it is his duty immediately to make an

inventory thereof, and cause the same to be appraised in the manner
prescribed in this title, and tile the same with the clerk.

Sec. 1088. The executor or administrator is entitled to the possession and control of the property of the deceased, both real and personal, and to receive the rents and profits thereof, until the administration is completed, or the same is surrendered to the heirs or devisees,

by order of the court or judge thereof; but where such property or
any portion thereof is in the possession of a third person by virtue of
a.valid subsisting lease or bailment the possession and control of the
executor or administrator is subordinate to the right of the lessee or
bailee. During the time the property is in the possession or control
of the executor oradministrator, it is his duty to keep the same in
repair, and preserve it from loss or decay as far as possible.

SEC. 1089. Whenever it appears probable from the aiiidavit of an
executor or administrator, or that of an heir or other person interested
in the estate, that any person has concealed, or in any way secreted or
disposed of any property of the estate, or any writing relating or pertaining thereto, or that such person has knowledge of any such property
or writing being so concealed, secreted or disposed of, and refuse to
disclose the same to the executor or administrator, the court or judge
thereof upon the application of such executor or administrator, may
cite such person to appear and answer under oath concerning the matter charged.

SEC. 1090. Such examination may be oral or upon written interrogatories filed by the applicant, but in either case the answers of the
person cited shall be reduced to writing, and subscribed by him and
filed. If such person be not in the county, where administration is
granted, the proceeding may be either before the court or judge
thereof of such county, or before the court. or judge thereof of the
county where such person resides or may be found. In the latter case,
a certified copy of the written interrogatories, if any, and the examination or other proceeding thereon or connected therewith, shall be
filed with the clerk of the court where administration is granted.

SEC. 1091. If the person so cited refuse to appear, or to answer
such interrogatories as may be allowed to be put to him, touching the
matter charged, he may be punished for a contempt, or may at once be
committed, by the warrant of the judge to the county jail there to
remain in close custody until he submits to the order of the court
or judge.

SEC. 1092. The court or judge thereof, upon the application of the
executor or administrator, may cite any person who has been entrusted
with any of the property of the deceased, to appear and answer concerning the same, when it appears probable that such person refuses or
neglects to render to the executor or administrator at true account

thereof. The application shall be made and the proceeding conducted
in the manner prescribed in sections 1089, 1090, and 1091 concerning
property or Writings alleged to be concealed, and with like effect.

SEC. 1093. If any person shall, before administration is granted,
embezzlc, alien or in any way convert to his own use, any of the
property of a deceased person, he is liable to the executor or administrator, in double the amount of damages which may be assessed therefor.

SEC. 1094. Until administration of the estate has been granted and
the inventory filed, the widow and minor children of the deceased, are
entitled to remain in the possession of the homestead, all the wearing
apparel of the family, and household furniture of the deceased, and
also to have a reasonable provision for their support, during such
period, to be allowed by the court or judge thereof.

SEC. 1095. Upon the filing of the inventory, the court or judge
thereof‘, shall make an order, setting apart, for the widow or minor
children of the deceased, if any, all the property of the estate, by law
exempt from execution. The property thus set apart, if there be a
widow, is her property, to be used or expended by her in the maintenance of herself and minor children, if any ; or if there be no widow,
it is the property of the minor child; or if more than one, of the
minor children in equal shares ; to be used or expended in the nurture
and education of such child or children, by the guardian thereof as
the law directs.

SEC. 1096. If the property so exempt, is insufficient for the support
of the widow and minor children, according to their circumstances
and condition in life, for one year after the filing of the inventory, the
court or judge thereof may order that the executor or administrator
pay to such widow, if any, and if not, then, to the guardian of such
minor children an amount sufficient for that purpose ; but such order

shall not be made unless it appear probable that the estate is sufiicient

to satisfy all the debts and liabilities of the deceased and pay the
expenses of administration in addition to the payment of such amount.

SEC. 1097. If, from the inventory of an intestate’s estate, who died
leaving a widow or minor children, it appears that the value of the
estate does not exceed one hundred and hfty dollars over and above

property exempt from execution, upon the tiling of the inventory the
court orjudge thereof shall make a decree providing, that the Whole
of the estate, after the payment of funeral expenses and expenses of
administration, be set apart, for such Widow or minor children, in like
manner and with like effect, as in case of property exempt from execution. There shall be no further proceeding in the administration of
such estate, unless further property be discovered.

SEC. 1098. If an intestate leave neither widow or minor children,
all the property of the estate is assets in the hands of the administrator, for the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of administration,
payment of the debts of the deceased, or distribution according to law.

barred not to be allowed.

SEC. 1099. Every executor or administrator, shall, immediately
after his appointment, publish a notice thereof, in some newspaper
published in the county, if there be one, or otherwise, in such paper
as may be designated by the court or judge thereof, as often as once a
week, for tour successive weeks, and ottener if the court or judge shall
so direct. Such notice shall require all persons having claims against
the estate, to present them, with the proper vouchers, within six months
from the date of such notice, to the executor or administrator, at a

place within the county therein specified.

SEC. 1100. Before the expiration of the six months mentioned in
the last section, a copy of the notice as published, with the proper
proof of publication, shall be filed with the clerk. A claim not presented within six months after the first publication of the notice, is not
barred, but it cannot be paid until the claims presented within that
period have been satisiied; and if the claim be not then due, or if it
be contingent, it shall nevertheless be presented as any other claim.
Until the administration has been completed, a claim against the
estate not barred by the statute of limitations, may be presented,
allowed and paid out of any assets then in the hands of the executor
or administrator not otherwise appropriated or liable.

SEC. 1101. Every claim presented to the executor or administrator,
shall be verified by the affidavit of the claimant, or some one on his
behalf, who has personal knowledge of the facts, to the effect that the
amount claimed is justly due, that no payments have been made
thereon, except as stated, and that there is no just counter-claim to
the same to the knowledge of the ailiant. When it appears or is
alleged that there is any written evidence of such claim the same may
be demanded by the executor or administrator, or that its non-production be accounted for.

SEC. 1102. When a claim is presented to the executor or administrator, as prescribed in the last section, he shall indorse upon it his
allowance or rejection, with the date thereof; and if he allow it, shall
pay it in due course of administration. No claim shall be allowed by
the executor or administrator which is barred by the statute of
limitations.

SEC. 1103. The effect of a judgment or decree against an executor
or administrator, on account of a claim again st the estate of his testator
or intestate, is only to establish the claim, as if it had been allowed by
him, so as to require it to be satished in due course of administration,
unless it appear that the complaint alleged assets in his hand applicable
to the satisfaction of such claim, and that such allegation was admitted
or found to be true, in which case the judgment or decree may be
enforced against such executor or administrator personally.

SEC. 1104. A claim established by judgment or decree against the
deceased in his life time, need not be verified by affidavit, but it is suflicient to present a certified copy of the judgment docket thereof, to
the executor or administrator for allowance or rejection, as in other

cases; but this section is not to be construed to prevent an execution

from being issued upon such judgment or decree as elsewhere provided
in this code.

SEC. 1105. If the executor or administrator doubt the validity of
any claim presented to him, he may agree in writing with the claimant
that an order of reference be made by the court or judge thereof, concerning the same. Upon the filing of such agreement, such court or
judge shall make the order accordingly.

SEC. 1106. The referee shall proceed to hear and determine the
matter, and report thereon to the court, where the order of reference
was made, in the same manner and with like effect as if the order was
made in an action or suit upon such claim.

SEC. 1107. If the executor or administrator is himself a creditor of
the testator or intestate, his claim, duly verified, may be presented to
the court or judge thereof, for allowance or rejection, but the allowance of such claim by such court or judge, does not conclude a creditor, heir or other person interested in the estate, in any action, suit or
proceeding between such executor or administrator, and such creditor,
heir or other person.

SEC. 1108. If the court or judge thereof, reject the claim of the
executor or administrator, either in whole or in part, or in case the
same is not presented for allowance as provided in the last section, the
executor or administrator may retain the amount thereof until the final
settlement of his accounts, when, if the same is controverted or
objected to by any person interested in the estate, the right of the
executor or administrator to have the allowance claimed, shall be tried
and determined by the court. If the claim is not presented to the court
or judge, as provided in section 1107, before it is barred by the statute
of limitations, such claim cannot be allowed, retained or recovered.

SEC. 1109. No sale of the property of an estate is valid unless made
by order of the court or judge thereof, as in this title prescribed, unless
herein otherwise provided. The application for an order of sale shall
he by the petition of the executor or administrator, and in case of real
property, a. citation to the heirs and others interested in such property.

SEC. 1110. Upon the filing of the inventory or at the next term of
court, the executor shall make an application to sell the personal property of the estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the
funeral charges, expenses of administration and the claims, if any,
against the estate; and it shall be the duty of the court or judge to
grant such order, and to direct and prescribe therein the terms of sale
upon which such property shall be sold, whether for cash or on credit,
or both.

SEC. 1111. Thereafter, the executor or administrator shall sell such
personal property from time to time for the purposes specified in the
last section‘, and as often and as much thereof as may be necessary.
Such sale shall be conducted in the same manner as a sale of personal
property on execution, unless otherwise provided in this title.

SEC. 1112. If upon the application for an order of sale, or upon a
subsequent application for that purpose, it appears to the court or judge
that it would be for the interest of the estate, it may order that the

‘executor or administrator may sell all the personal property of the
estate or any article thereof at private sale. If any articles of personal
property have been specially bequeathed, they are to be exempt from
the operation of the order of sale, so long as any property of the
estate not specially devised or bequeathed, remains unsold, or appropriated to the purposes specified in section 1110.

SEC. 1113. Wlien the proceeds of the sale of personal property
have been exhausted, and the charges, expenses and claims specified
in section 1110 have not all been satisfied, the executor or administrator shall sell the real property of the estate or so much thereof, as may
be necessary for that purpose. If any of such real property have been
specially devised, it shall be exempt from the operation of the order of
sale, in the same manner as personal property specially bequeathed.

SEC. 1114. The petition for the order of sale of real property, shall
state the amount of the sales of personal property, the charges, expenses
and claims still unsatisfied so far as the same can be ascertained, a description of the real property of the estate, the condition and probable
value of the different portions or lots thereof, the amount and nature.
of any liens thereon, the names, ages and residence of the devisees, if
any, and of the heirs of the deceased, so far as known.

SEC. 1115. Upon the nling of the petition, a citation shall issue to
the devisees and heirs therein mentioned and to all others unknown,
if any such there be, to appear at a term of court therein mentioned,
not less than ten days after the service of such citation, to show cause
if any exist, why an order of sale should not be made as in the petition

prayed for.

SEC. 1116. Upon an heir or devisee, known, and resident Within
this state, such citation shall be served and returned as a summons,
and upon an heir or devisee unknown, or non-resident, it may be
served by publication, not less than four weeks, or for such further
time as the court or judge may prescribe. When service of the citation is made by publication, there shall be published with it a brief

description of the property described in the petition.

SEC. 1117. If upon the hearing, the court nnd that it is necessary
that the real property or any portion thereof should be sold, it shall
make the order accordingly and prescribe the terms thereof, whether
of cash or credit, or both ; and if the court find that such property cannot be divided without probable injury and loss to the estate, it may

order that it, or any specinc lot or portion thereof shall be sold wholly,
whether otherwise necessary or not.

SEC. 1118. Upon the order being made, the executor or administrator shall sell the property therein speciiied upon the terms therein
directed, and in the manner herein otherwise provided. Such sale
shall be made in the same manner as like property is sold on execution. When the sale is upon credit, the executor or administrator,
shall take the note of the purchaser for the purchase money, with a
mortgage upon the property to secure the payment thereof.

SEC. 1119. At the term of court next following the sale of real
property, the executor or administrator, shall make a return of his
proceedings concerning such sale. At such term any of the persons
cited to appear on the application for the order of sale may file his

objections to the conhrmation of such sale.

SEC. 1120. Upon the hearing the court shall conhrm the sale and
decree that the executor or administrator make a conveyance to the
purchaser, unless it appear that there were irregularities in the sale, or
that the sum hidden for the property is disproportionate to the value
thereof, and that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per cent., exclusive of the expenses of a new sale, may be obtained therefor, in either
of which cases the court shall make an order vacating the sale and
directing that the property be resold ; and upon such second sale, the
property or any specific portion or lot thereof ordered to be "re-sold,
shall be sold as if no previous sale had taken place. In case no objections are made to the confirmation of the sale as provided in section
1119, the court shall nevertheless examine the proceedings concerning
such sale, and if it appear proper, may make the order of resale provided for in this section in the same manner and with like effect as if

objections had been iiled thereto.

SEC. 1121. A conveyance executed by the executor or administrator shall set forth the original order of sale and the order confirming
the same and directing the conveyance, and shall operate to convey all
the estate right and interest of the testator or intestate in the premises

at the time of his death.

SEC. 1122. When a testator shall have specially bequeathed any
specific article of personal property, or given any legacy by will, and
there shall not be sufficient personal property, besides such specific article, or the value of such legacy, to pay the funeral charges, expenses

of administration, and claims against the estate, the executor or administrator shall obtain an order to sell the real property sufiicient to make
up the deficiency, in the manner hereinbefore provided.

SEC. 1123. VVhen the testator shall make provision in his will for
the sale or disposition of all, or any particular portion of his estate, for
t.he payment of funeral charges, expenses of administration, or of
claims against the estate, the property so appropriated may be sold or
disposed of as directed by the executor or administrator with the will
annexed, without an order of the court therefor; but he shall be
bound to conduct the sale, and make a return thereof in all respects,
as if it were made by order of the court, unless there are special directions in the will concerning the manner and terms of sale, in which
case he shall be governed by such directions in such respects.

SEC. 1124. If the provision made by the Will, or the property
thereby appropriated, be insuflicient for the purpose intended, the
remaining portion of the estate may be sold for that purpose according

to the provisions of this title.

SEC. 1125. The property, real and personal, given by the will to
any devisee or legatee, is liable for the payment of the funeral charges,
expenses of administration, and of claims against the estate, and if
there be more than one such devisee or legatee, then in proportion to
the value or amount of the several devises or legacies; except that
specific devises and legacies shall be exempt from such liability, if
such appear to have been the intention of the testator, and there be
other sufficient property to satisfy such charges, expenses and claims.

SEC. 1126. If the deceased was, at the time of his death, a party
to a contract for the purchase of real property, his interest in such real

property by virtue of such contract, may be sold in the same manner,
as if such contract had been executed in the life time of the deceased

by a conveyance to him of such property according to the legal effect
and terms of such contract.

SEC. 1127. If there be any payments due or to become due on such
contract to the vendor of the deceased, the sale is made subject thereto,

and before the same can be confirmed or the contract assigned to the
purchaser, such purchaser shall execute an undertaking with one or
more suiiicient sureties, in an amount not less than double the value of
all the payments then due or to become due, for the benefit of whom
it may concern, to be void upon the condition that such purchaser will

make all such payments according to the terms of such contract, and
indemnify the executor or administrator or others Whom it may concern, against all damages, costs and expenses, by reason of any covenant or agreement contained in such contract.

SEC. 1128. The order of confirmation of such sale shall direct the
executor or administrator to make an assignment of such contract to
the purchaser, which assignment shall vest in the purchaser, his heirs
and assigns, all the estate, right and interest of the deceased at the time
of his death in such real property ; and give to the purchaser the same
rights and remedies against the vendor thereof, as the deceased would

have had or been entitled to, if living.

SEC. 1129. If the deceased left any property real or personal, under
mortgage, and did not devise or provide for the redemption of the
same by Will, the court or judge thereof upon the application of the
executor or administrator, or the application of an heir or creditor or
other person interested in the estate, may order the executor or administrator to redeem such property out of the proceeds of the other personal property; if it appear that such redemption would be for the

interest of the estate, and not prejudicial to creditors.

SEC. 1130. If upon such application such redemption be deemed
not proper, or inexpedient, the court shall order such property to be
sold in like manner and with like effect, as is provided in other cases

of the sale of real property by this title; and the conveyance to the purchaser shall operate to convey to him all the estate, right and interest,
which the deceased would have had in the property, had _not the same

been mortgaged by him.’

SEC. 1131. Ten days before making an order for the application of
the proceeds of such sale, the mortgagee or other person to Whom the

debt which is secured by such mortgage is payable shall be cited to
appear and show the amount of his debt and make his objections if
any to the report of the expenses of the proceeding and sale as claimed
by the executor or administrator, and thereupon the court shall order
that the proceeds of the sale, be first applied to be payment of the
proper expenses of the proceeding and sale, and secondly to the satisfaction of such debt, and the residue, if any, in due course of

administration.

SEC. 1132. Sections 1129, 1130 and 1131, shall not be construed to
include a mortgage which has been foreclosed or upon which a suit has

been commenced for foreclosure, before the.application for the order
of redemption or sale is made, nor to any other lien arising upon judgment or decree given against the deceased in his life time.

SEC. 1133. If the debt secured by the mortgage mentioned in section 1129, be not due at the time of the making of the order for
redemption or application of the proceeds of sale, the party to Whom
it is payable shall be entitled to receive in satisfaction thereof such sum
as may be ascertained to be equal to the present value thereof.

SEC. 1134. The order of confirmation of sale in this title mentioned,
is conclusive as to the regularity of the sale, and no further. All purchases of the property of the estate by an executor or administrator,
however made, whether directly or indirectly, are prohibited; and if
made, are void.

SEC. 1135. Whenever the assets of the estate are insufficient to
satisfy the funeral charges, expenses of administration, and the claims
against the estate, and the deceased shall in his life time have made or
suffered any conveyance, transfer, or sale of any property real or personal, or any right or interest therein, with intent to delay, hinder or
defraud creditors, or when such conveyance, transfer or sale has been
so made or suffered, that the same is void in law as against creditors,
or when the deceased in his life time, has suffered, consented, or procured any judgment or decree to be given against him with such
intent, or in such manner as to be likewise void, it is the duty of such
executor or administrator to make application by petition to the county
court or judge thereof, for leave to commence and prosecute to final
judgment or decree, the necessary and proper actions, suits or proceedings, to have such conveyance, transfer, sale, judgment or decree,
declared void, and the property affected thereby, discharged from the
effect thereof.

SEC. 1136. If upon the application it appear to such court or judge
that the assets are insutlicient for the purposes specified in the last section, and that it is probable that the conveyance, transfer, judgment,
or decree was made, suffered, consented to, or procured with the intent
or in the manner specified in the last section, it shall make the order
directing the proceedings to be commenced and prosecuted as to any
or all of the matters alleged in the petition and necessary to supply
the deficiency in the assets.

SEC. 1137. The property recovered by means of any proceeding

in pursuance of the -last two sections, is to be sold and appropriated to
supply the deficiency mentioned in section 1134, in the same manner
as other like property, but the right to, or interest in, the surplus, if
any, remains as if such proceeding had not been allowed or commenced.

from the date of the notice of his appointment, and every six months
thereafter, until the administration is completed, and he is discharged
from his trust, render an account verified by his own oath and file the
same with the clerk, showing the amount of money received and
expended by him, from whom received and to whom paid, with the
proper voucher for such payments; the amount of the claims
presented against the estate, and allowed or disallowed, and the name
of the claimants of each, and any other matter necessary to shew the

condition of the affairs thereof.

SEC. 1139. An executor or administrator who shall fail to file an
account as required in the last section, may be required by a citation
ordered by the court or judge to appear and do so, either upon the
application of an heir or creditor or other person interested in the
estate, or without it. If the executor or administrator refuse or neglect
to appear when cited, or to file the account as required, he may be
punished for a contempt, or by warrant of the j udgc be committed at
once to close custody in the jail of the county until he consent to do so.

Sec. 1140. At the first term of the court after the filing of the
first semi-annual account and each semi-annual account thereafter, the

court shall ascertain and determine if the estate be suflicient to satisfy
the claims presented and allowed by the executor or administrator
within the first six months or any succeeding period of six months
thereafter, after the date of the notice of his appointment, after paying
the funeral charges, and expenses of administration, and if so, it shall
so order and direct, but if the estate be insufiicient for that purpose,
it shall ascertain what per cent. of such claims it is sufiicient to satisfy,
and order and direct accordingly.

SEC. 1141. When the estate is fully administered, it shall be the
duty of the executor or administrator to file his final account. Such
account shall be verified by his own oath, and contain a detailed statement of the amount of money received and expended by him, from
whom received and to whom paid and refer to the vouchers for such
payments, and the amount of money and property, if any, remaining
unexpended or appropriated. Upon the filing of the final account the
court or judge thereof shall make an order directing notice thereof to
be given in the same manner as the notice of an appointment of an
executor or administrator, and appoint a day at some term subsequent
thereto for the hearing of objections to such final account and the
settlement thereof.

SEC. 1142. Any heir, creditor or other person interested in the
estate, may on or before the day appointed for such hearing and settlement file his objections thereto, or to any particular item thereof,
specifying the particulars of such objections ; but no creditor shall be
allowed to object to such account, whose claim has been satisfied as
allowed by the executor or administrator, or ‘established by judgment
or decree.

Sec. 1143. Upon the hearing the court shall give a decree allowing
or disallowing the iinal account either in whole or in part as may be
just and right, and such decree in any other action, suit or proceeding
between the parties interested or their representatives is primary evidence of the correctness of the account, as thereby allowed and settled.

SEC. 1144. An executor or administrator, is chargeable in his

account with all the property of the estate which may come°into his
possession, at the value of the appraisement contained in the inventory,
except as in this title otherwise provided.

property of the estate ; nor-suffer loss for the decrease in value or the

destruction thereof, without his fault; and if any of the property of
the estate sell for more than its appraised value, he shall account for
the excess, and if any such property sell for less than its appraised
value, he shall not be responsible for the loss, unless occasioned by his
fault. He shall not be accountable for the debts due the estate, if it
appear that they remain uncollected without his fault. He shall not
purchase any claim against the estate which he represents, and if he
satisfies any such claim for less than its nominal value, he is only entitled to charge in his account the sum actually paid.

SEC. 1146. An executor or administrator shall be allowed in the
settlement of his account, all necessary expenses incurred in the care,
management and settlement of the estate, including reasonable attorney fees in any necessary litigation, or matter requiring legal advice or
counsel. For his services, he shall receive such compensation as the
law provides; but when the deceased by his will, has 1nade special
provision for the compensation of his executor, such executor is not
entitled to any other compensation for his services, unless he shall
within ten days after his appointment, subscribe and tile with the
clerk a written declaration renouncing the compensation provided by
the will.

SEC. 1147. Notwithstanding the provision in the will for the compensation of an executor, if the estate be insufficient to satisfy the
claims against it, the court shall reduce such compensation, so far as
may be necessary to satisfy such claims, to an amount equal to what
the executor would have been entitled, if no such provision had
been made. .

SEC. 1148. The compensation provided by law for an executor or
administrator is a commission upon the whole estate accounted for by
him as follows :

1. For the first thousand dollars, or any less sum, at the rate of
seven per cent. thereof;

2. For all above that sum and not exceeding two thousand dollars, at the rate -of five per cent. thereof;

3. ' For all above two thousand and not exceeding four thousand
dollars, at the rate of four per cent. thereof;

4. For all above the last mentioned sum, at the rate of two per
cent. thereof.

In all cases such further compensation as is just and reasonable, may
be allowed by the court or judge thereof, for any extraordinary and

unusual services, not ordinarily required of an executor or administrator in the discharge of this trust.

Sec. 1149. Before the time appointed for the hearing and settlement of a final account, the executor or administrator shall tile with
the clerk a copy of the notice thereof, with the proper proof of its
publication as directed. An executor or administrator who shall fail

against in like manner, and with like effect as provided in section 1139,

in case of failure to file a semi-annual account.

pay all his debts, an executor or administrator, by order of the court
or judge thereof, may compound with him and give him a discharge
upon receiving a fair and just proportion of his effects; but if such
compounding is procured or induced by the fraudulent representations
or conduct of such debtor, such payment shall only operate to discharge
a like amount of the debt.

SEC. 1151. The charges and claims against the estate which have
been presented and allowed, or presented and disallowed, but subsequently established by judgment or decree, within the first six months
after the date of the notice of appointment of the executor or administrator, shall be paid in the following order, and those presented and

allowed or established in like manner within each succeeding period of
six months thereafter, during the continuance of the administration, in

public corporation therein;

5. Debts preferred by the laws of the United States;

6. Debts which, at the death of the deceased, were a lien upon
his real property or any right or interest therein according to the priority of their several liens;

7. All other claims against the estate.

SEC. 1152. The preference given by subdivision 6 of the last section, shall only extend to the proceeds of the property upon which the
lien exists, and as to such proceeds such debt is to be preferred to any
of the classes mentioned in such section, other than the taxes upon
such property.

Sim. 1153. If such debt has been established by judgment or
decree against the deceased in his life time, such judgment or decree,
if the proceeds of the personal property be not sufficient to satisfy it,
may, in the discretion of the court or judge thereof, be either satisiied
from the proceeds of the sale of the property, by the executor or
administrator, upon which it is a lien, or enforced by execution against
such property. Such sale by the executor or administrator discharges
the property from the lieu of the judgment or decree, but the same
attaches to the proceeds thereof, after deducting therefrom the expenses
of sale.

SEC. 1154. Except as specially provided in the last three sections,
if the estate be insuflicient to pay all the claims and charges of any
one class, payable Within any period of six months during the administration as provided in section 1151, each creditor of such class shall

SEC. 1155. The executor named in the will, or if there be none or

- if he do not attend to it, then the husband, Widow, or next of kin, in

the order herein named, are authorized to incur funeral charges on
account of the estate in the burial of the deceased, before administration of the estate is granted; and the burial of the deceased may be
in a manner and at a cost, according to his circumstances and condition

in life, but no funeral charges, except those necessary to give the

_deceased a plain and decent burial, shall be allowed out of the estate,

where the assets are not sufiicient to satisfy all other claims against it,
including legacies and devises, if there be any.

SEC. 1156. The executor or administrator may retain in his hands,
in preference to any claim or charge against the estate, the amount of
his own compensation and the necessary expenses of administration.

SEC. 1157. A debt, due and payable, is not entitled to preference
over one of the same class not due, if the latter be presented. within
the same period. A debt not due Whether contingent or absolute,
upon being presented, shall, if absolute be satisfied by the payment of
such sum as the court or judge thereof may prescribe by order to be
equal to its present value, and if contingent, by the payment into
court, for the benetit of the creditor subject to the contingency, of a.
sum, to be ascertained in like manner, equal to its present value.

‘ executor or administrator is personally liable to each creditor included

in such order, for such amount.

SEC. 1159. If all the charges and claims shall have been satisfied

may be, the court or judge thereof shall direct the payment of legacies and the distribution of the remaining proceeds of the personal
property among the heirs or other persons entitled thereto.

satisfaction of claims against the estate, as by this chapter provided;
but upon the settlement of the estate, and the termination of the
administration thereof’, so much of such real property as remains
unsold or unappropriated, is discharged from such possession and liability Without any order or decree therefor, but if there be any surplus
of the proceeds of the sale of such real property, or any part thereof,
the court or judge thereof shall order and direct a distribution of such
surplus among those who would have been entitled to such land if the
same had not been sold.

SEC. 1161. At any time after the filing of the first semi-annual

account, any heir, devisce or legatee, may apply to the court by petition, for an order that he have the possession and rents and profits
thereof of the portion of the real property to which he may be entitled,
and that payment be made to him of his legacy or distributive share
of the personal property of such estate, as the case may be.

SEC. 1162. Notice of the application shall be given to the executor
or administrator ten days before the term at which it is made. If
upon the hearing it appear that the estate is but little in debt, the
court in its discretion may grant the petition or some part thereof, upon
the condition that such applicant file with the clerk within a time in
the order specified, an undertaking with one or more suflicient sureties
for the benefit of whom it may concern, in a sum double the value of

condition that such heir, legatee or devisee, will pay, when required,
his proportion towards satisfying any claim against the estate.

qualihcations as sureties in bail upon arrest, and shall justify before the
court or judge thereof in like manner. The costs of the proceeding
shall be paid by the applicant.

necessary to satisfy any claim against the estate to require the payment
of all or any part of the sum therein specified it shall be the duty of
the executor or administrator to apply by petition to the court for a
decree to that effect. Notice of the application shall be given to the
party filing the undertaking, ten days before the term at which the

application is made.

SEC. 1165. If upon the hearing, it appear necessary and proper that
such payment should be made the court shall decree accordingly,
specifying therein the amount to be paid, and within what time ; and
if the amount be not paid within the time specified, the decree may be
enforced against such party and the sureties in the undertaking by
execution, in the same manner as a decree in the circuit court.
