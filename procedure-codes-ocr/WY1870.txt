lien of any judgment creditor who shall fail to take out execution and cause a levy to be made as herein provided,

sheriff and coroner, or the inability of such oliicer, until one

reason of the delinquency. The action may be instituted
and proceeded in a certified copy of the bond, which copy
shall be furnished by the person holding the original thereof.

SEC. 651. The writ of mandamus may be issued to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person, to compel the
performance. of an act which the law specially enjoins as a
duty resulting from an office, trust or station. But, though
it may require an inferior tribunal to exercise its judgment,
or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions, it cannot
control judicial discretion.

SEC. 652. This writ may not be issued in any case
where there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of the law; It may issue on the information of the
party beneficially interested.

SEC. 653. The writ is either alternative or peremtory.
The alternative Writ must state ccncisely the facts showing
the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his
omission to perform it, andcommand him that immediately
upon receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, he
‘do the act required to be performed or show cause before
the court whence the writ issued, at a specified time and

place, why he has not done so; and that he then and there
return the writ with his certificate of having done as he is
commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a similar
form, except that the words requiring the defendant to
show cause why he has not done as commanded, must be
omitted.

SEC. 654. When the right to require the performance
of the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse
can be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus
may be allowed in the first instance; in all other cases the
alternative writ must be first issued.

SEC. 655. The motion for the writ must be made upon ‘
afiidavit, and the court may require a notice of the application to be given to the adverse party, or may grant an order
to show cause why it should not be allowed, or may grant
the writ without notice.

SEC. 656. The allowance of the writ must be indorsed
thereon, signed by the judge of the court granting it, and
the writ must be served personally upon the defendant; if

such further day as the court may allow, the party on
whom the writ shall have been served, may show cause by
answer made in the same manner as an answer to a petition
in a civil action.

SEC. 658. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandamus must be allowed against the defendant; if answer be
made containing new matter, the same shall not, in any
respect, conclude the plaintiff, who may, on the trial or other
proceeding, avail himself of any valid objections to sumcibncy, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct.
denial or by way of avoidance.

SEC. 659. No other pleading or written allegation is
allowed than the writ and answer; these are the pleadings
in the case, and have the same effect, and are to be construed
and may be amended in the same manner as pleadings in a
civil action; and the issues thereby joined must be tried,

and the further proceedings thereon had, in the same
manner as in a civil action.

SEC. 660. If judgment be given for the plaintif, he
shall recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to
be ascertained by the court or jury, or by referees, as in a
civil action, and costs; and a peremptory mandamus shall,
also, be granted to him without delay.

SEC. 661. A recovery of damages by virtue of this title, against a party who shall have made a return to a writ
of mandamus, is a bar to any other action against the same
party for. the making of such return.

SEC. 662. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is
directed to any public officer, body or board, commanding
the performance of any public duty, specially enjoined by
law, if it appear to the court that such oflicer or any member
of such body or board, has, without just excuse, refused or
neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may
impose a fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon every
such oliicer or member of such body or board. Such fine,
when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the county
where the duty ought to have been performed; and the
payment thereof is a bar to an action for any penalty
incurred by such omcer or member of such body or board,
by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty
so enjoined.

or doubtful, these facts must be set forth in the petition with
reasonable certainty.

SEC. 665. Creditors having a speclhc or general lien
upon all or any portion of the property may or may not be
made parties at the option of the plaintiff.

SEC. 666. If the lien‘ is upon one or more undivided
interests of any of the parties it shall, after partition or‘
sale,.remain a charge upon those particular interests or the
proceeds thereof. But the due proportion of costs is a
charge upon those interests paramount to all other liens. V

SEC. 667. The answers of the defendants must state
among other things, the amount and nature of their respective interests. They may deny the interests of any of the
plaintiffs, and by supplemental pleading, if necessary, may
deny the interests of any of the other defendants.

SEC. 668. When there are two or more plaintid’s they
may reply jointly, or either of them may reply to any or
all the answers of the defendants»

SEC. 669. Issues may, thereupon, be joined and tried
