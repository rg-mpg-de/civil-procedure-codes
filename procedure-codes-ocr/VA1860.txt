newed as herein before prescribed, shall be prosecuted by and against

of twenty-one years, or from the termination of the guardian's or cura-
tor's office, whichever shall happen first; nnd upon the bond of any per-
sonal representative of a decedent or committee of an insane person, the
right of action of a person obtaining execution against such representa-
tive or committee, or to whom payment or delivery of estate in the hands 
of such representative or committee, shall be ordered by a court acting
upon his account, shnll be deemed to have first accrued from the return 
day of such execution, or from the time of the right to require payment
or delivery upon such order, whichever shall happen first. And as tog
any suit against such fiduciary himself, or his representative, which could~ 
have been maintained if he had given no bond, there shall be no other
limitation than would exist if the preceding section was not passed. 
7. If any person, against whom the right shall have so accrued on
an award, or on any such contract, shall, by writing signed by him or his
agent, promise payment of money on such award or contract, the person to~ 
whom the right shall have so accrued may maintain an action for the ~o-
ney so promised, within such number of years after tho said promise, as it 
might originally have been maintained within upon the award or OORtract,

action, and in the latter case, in answer to a plea under the fifth section,
may, by way of replication, state such promise, and that such action was 
brought within the said number of years thereafter i but no premise,
except by writing u aforesaid, shall take any case out of the operation of
the said fifth section, or deprive any party of the benefit thereof. An
o.oknowledgment in writing u aforesaid, from which a promise of pay­
ment may be implied, shall be deemed to be such promise in the meaning
of this section. 
8. No acknowledgment or promise, by any personal representative of
a decedent, or by one of two or more joint contractors, shall charge the 
estate of such decedent, or charge any other of such contractors, in any 
case in which, but for such acknowledgment or promise, the decedent's
estate or another contractor could hnve been protected under tho fifth 
section.
9. No provision in the will of any testator, devising his real estate, or 
any part thereof, suhject to the payment of bis debts, or charging the

so operate.
10. Every action, or scire faeias upon a recognizance, shall be eom­

next after the right to bring the same shall have first accrued ; and if the
recognizance be of such bail, within three years after the right to sue ont
execution upon the judgment in such suit shall have accrued, omitting in
the computation of time such part of said three years, as the right to sue
such execution shall have been suspended by injunction, aupersedeas or
other legal process. 
11. Every personal action, for which no limitation is otherwise pre­
scribed, shall be brought within five years next after the right to bring
the same shall have accrued, if it be for a matter of such nature, that in
case a party die, it can be brought by or against his representative, and
if it be for a matter not of such nature, shall be brought within one ye.ar
next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued, unless it be 
against a master or skipper of a vessel for carrying a slave out of the 
statoi to which this chapter shall not extend.
12. Every action upon a judgment or decree, rendered in any other 
state or country, shall be barred, if by the Jaws of such state or country
such action would there be barred, and the judgment or decree be inca­
pable of being otherwise enforced there. And whether so barred or not,
no action against a person who shall have resided in this state, during the
ten years next preceding such action, shall be brought upon any such
judgment or decree, rendered more than ten years before the commence­
ment of such action.

void by the second section of the one hundred and eighteenth chapter. 
14. A bill in equity to repeal, in whole or in part, any grant of land 
by the commonwealth, shall be brought within ten years next after the
date of such grant. 
When limitation does not apply or is qualified.
15. If any person, to whom the right accrues to bring any such per- 
aonal action, or scire faclas, or any such bill to repeal a grant, shall be, at
the time the same accrues, an infant, mnrried woman or insane, the same
may be brought within the like number of years after his becoming of;·~}/wm. 
full age, unmarried or sane, that is allowed to a person, having no such
' di b · h ti h · h ft h 
nnpe iment, to rmg t e same a ter t e ng t accrues, or a er sue ae-
knowledgmcnt as aforesaid, except that it shall in no case be brought, 
after twenty years from the time when the right accrued.
16. If a person die before the time, at which any right mentioned in 
this chapter would have accrued to him, if he had continued alive, and
there be an interval of more than five years between the death of such
person and the qualification of his personal representative, such personal
representative shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to have 
qualified on the last day of the said fire years.
17. Where any such right as is mentioned in this chapter shall accrue 
against a person who had before resided in this state, if such person
shall, by departing without the same, or by absconding or concealing
himself, or by any other indirect ways or means, obstruct the prosecution 
of such right, the time that such obstruction may have continued shall
not be computed as any part of the time within which the said right~~:~~
might or ought to have hem prosecuted. But this section shall not avail 
against any other person than him so obstructed, notwithstanding another
might have been jointly sued with him, if there had been no such ob- 
struction. And upon a contract which was made and was to be performed
in another state or country, by a person who then resided therein, no
action shall be maintained, after the right of notion thereon is barred by
the laws of such state or country.

action for the same cause, or if there be occaslon to bring a new suit, by
reason of the loss or destruction of any of the papers or records in a
former suit which was in doc time; in every such case, notwithstanding
the expiration of the time within which a new action or suit most other-
wise have been brought, the same may be brought within one year after
such abatement or such arrest or reversal of judgment, or such loss or
destruction, but not after.

How issued and proceeded on to judgment. 
j 1. Any claim to property, or to any debt, fine, or other money, which
Id b bl b . I it . . if f 
wou e reeovera e, y action at aw or sm m equity, 1 o greater
value or amount than fifty dollars (exclusive of interest), shall, when the 
claim is to a fine, if it be limited to an amount not exceeding twenty dol-
lars, and in other cases, if the claim be not of greater value or amount
than fifty dollars (exclusive of interest), be cognizable by a. justice; e.od
even if the claim be for or against the town or county in which such jus- 
tice resides. But in every case where the sum or thing in controversy
exceeds the amount or value of twenty dollars, the justice shall, upon the
application of the defendant, a.t any time before trial, remove the cause
to the court of the county or corporation wherein the same shall be
brought, and the clerk of the said court shall <locket the same, and it
shall be proceeded in as if it were a motion in said court, under the sixtlt
section of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven, of which the notice was
docketed at the time such case is so docketed. 
2. A justice, when applied to by any person, shall issue a warrant
to tabl 
. . hi h . h h
a cone e, rcqmrmg m to summon t e person agaiust w om t o 
claim is made, to appear before him or some other justice, on a certain
day, not exceeding thirty days from the date thereof, to answer such
claim. It shall be made returnable to some place within the constable's
district in which the defendant resides, unless the justice, for good cause
shown on oath, direct it to be returned to some other place within his
county or corporation. t 
3. Subpcenas for witnesses may be issued by a. justice, directed to a
constable of nuy county or corporation. Any person, summoned to attend§ 
as a witness before a justice, who shall fail so to attend, shall, unless he
show a reasonable excuse therefor, within ten days after being summoned
to state such excuse, be fined, by the justice before whom the failure oc-
curred, a sum not exceeding five dollars, for the use of the party on whose
behalf he was summoned'. 
4. The justice shall try such warrant, according to the principles of
law and equity, and give judgment for the sum due to either party, with§
interest, or for the property to which the plaintiff is entitled (or its value), 
with damages. Costs shall be awarded or refused to either party, on the
like principles. 
5. The justice rendering any such judgment, shall, in a book kept for
such purpose, enter the date thereof, the name of the person for, and of 
the person against, whom it is, and its a.mount; also, the date of any
execution issued thveon, and to whom delivered. If he fail to do so, he
shall forfeit twenty dollars. The cost of such book shall be chargeable
on the county or corporation. The justice shall also write on the face of
the paper or writing on which the warrant issued, or on any writing al-
lowed as a set-off, the date and amount of the judgment and costs, and
affix his name thereto. 
~. After thirty days from any such judgment, no new trial shall be
granted in the case; nor shall it be granted within the thirty days, unless 
the opposite party be present at the time of the application, or unless
after five days' notice to him (if in the county or corporation), of the time
and place of the application for such new trial. The justice who ren-
dered the judgment' shall alone have power to grant such new trial, while
he is in office; if he die, resign, be absent from the county, or be re-
moved, it may be granted by another justice. 
-:::!1, If a judg~ent of a justice of the pe~ce be f~r a sum exceeding ten
nnd not excec<lmg twenty dollars, exclusive of mterest and costs, the 
justice rendering it may l.ltay execution on it forty days from ita date. If
the judgment be for a sum exceeding twenty and not exceeding thirty
dollars, he may stay execution on it sixty days from its date. If the judg­
ment be for a sum exceeding thirty dollars, he may stay execution on it 
ninety days from its date; on such security being given in either case for
d ffi . . 
its payment, as he may eem su cient, From any such Judgment the
justice rendering it may, within ten days, on such security being given as 
he approves, for the payment of the same, and all costs and damages (if
it be affirmed), allow an appeal where the case involves the constitution­ 
ality or validity of an ordinance or by-law of a corporation, or where the
matter in controversy, exclusive of interest, is of greater' amount or 
value than ten dollars. The verbal acknowledgment of any surety taken
under this section shall be sufficient, and the endorsement by the justice
of the name of the surety upon the warrant on which the judgment is
rendered, shall be conclusive evidence of such acknowledgment. The
court in which the appeal is cognizable may, on motion, for good cause
shown, require the appellant to give new or additional security, reasonable
notice of such motion having been given to said appellant; and if he fail
to give such security, the appeal shall be dismissed with costs, and the
court shall award execution on the judgment rendered by the justice.
with eosta, against the appellant and his surety. 
How execution is is&ued, directed, and returnable. 
f 8. The justice rendering any judgment may issue a writ of fieri facias
thereon immediately, if there be not a new trial granted, nor an appeal
allowed, nor a stay of execution. And where there is such stay of exe­
cution, if the judgment be not paid within the forty or sixty clays, as tho
case may be, a writ of fieri faeias shall thereupon be issued hy a justice
against the party and bis surety jointly, on which no security shall be 
taken.
9. A writ of fieri faeias issued by a justice, shall be directed to a con­ 
stable. It may be directed to and executed by a constable for any county
or corporation which the plaintiff may designate, and shall be returnable 
within sixty days. If not wholly satisfied, it may, within one year from
the judgment, be returned to and renewed by a justice, notwithstanding 
the provisions of chapter forty-nine. But every execution issued by a
justice, which is not so returned and renewed, shall he returned by the
constable to the clerk's office of the court by which he was appointed,
And when for any cause it is unfit for a writ of fieri facias to be directed
to a constable, such writ shall ho directed to and executed by a sheriff' or
sergeant of the county or corporation. 
10. The clerk shall <locket all executions returned by a constable, and
index the same in the name of both plaintiff and defendant, and file them
alphabetically, in a separate bundle for each year; for which servlces tho
clerk shall he entitled to a fee, to be paid by the plaintiff in each case, of 
twenty cents. Such further executions may be issued for the recovery of
the amount cftte on any execution so returned, as if the judgment on which 
it issued had been rendered in court. The same may, at the option of
the plaintiff, be directed to and executed either by a. constable, or by a
sheriff or sergeant; and the same proceedings shall be had upon executions
issued under this section, as upon executions issued upon judgments of 
courts.
Motion, against constables, 
11. A copy from the entry in the justice's book, of the date of any
execution issued by him, and to whom delivered, shall be evidence in any 
proceeding against the officer to whom it is entered as delivered, for fail-
ing to make duo return thereof, or for failing to pay over money received
thereon. If a justice, upon being applied to for a copy of any entry,
shall refuse it, and afterwards, upon being summoned to produce the
book in which such entry is or ought to have been made, shall fail to
produce such entry, be shall forfeit twenty dollars to the person on whose
behalf he is summoned. 
12. If an officer fail to make due return of any execution issued by n.
justice, he may, after ten days' notice, be fined from time to time by a!~~:~~- 
justice, on the motion of the plaintiff in such execution, in like manner
as a court may fine an officer, who foils to make due return of an execu-
tion issued from such court. And if an officer shall make such return
upon an execution issued by a justice, as would, on a motion against the
officer, authorize judgment to be entered against him for the amount of
such execution, or any part thereof, if the execution had issued from a
court, the creditor on whose behalf such execution issued, or his personal
representative, may, on a motion before a justice, after like notice, obtain
such judgment against the officer, his sureties and others, as could be given
by a court, if the execution had issued from a court. This section shall 
not prevent a motion in court under chapter forty-nine, or under the
fifth section of chapter one hundered and sixty-seven. 
13. If a constable collect money mentioned in an execution after the
return day thereof, he and his sureties shall be liable for the money so 
11
d
. lik if h 11 . had bee b r: h 
co ecte , m e manner as 1 t e co ection n erore t e return
day. And if a constable receive money on account of any claim en- 
trusted to him to warrant for, and recoverable by warrant, he and his
sureties shall be liable for the money so received, as for money collected
under execution ; and after six months from the date of any receipt for
such claim, signed in his official character, such receipt shall be prima
facie evidence of the receipt of the money. 
Where distress or lev.ff on. properl!J not exceeding t:alue of twenty dol-
lars ; and title disputed. 
.::Ill. When an execution on a judgment of a. justice, or a warrant of
distress, is levied upon property not of greater value than twenty dollars,§ 
which is claimed by any person other than the party against whom it
issued, such perf!on may apply to n. justice of the county or corporation
in which the levy is, for a warrant to n constable, requiring him to sum-
mon both the creditor and debtor, to show cause why the property should
not be discharged from the levy. The justice shall issue such warrant,
returnable in not less than five days ; and if an earlier day shall have 
been fixed for the sale of the property, he shall make an order on the
warrant, requiring the postponement of the sale until after return day.
Upon hearing the parties, or such of them as may attend after being
summoned, he shall order the officer to deliver the property to the claim­
ant, or the person from whom it was taken, or shall dismiss the sum­
mons, as may seem most proper, and may give such judgment for costs
as he may deem just. If the property be of the value of ten dollars, the
justice shall, within five days, allow an appeal from such order and judg­
ment, on security being given as in the appenle before mentioned in this
chapter. 
O 
When appeal from judgment of juatice. 
~5. The justice, from whose judgment an appeal is allowed, shall im-
mediately deliver to the clerk of the court which bas cognizance of the
appeal, the original warrant, with the judgment 8Il(1 the name of the
surety endorsed thereon, and the clerk shall docket the same. 
~6. When an appeal is allowed from any order or judgment of a jus-
tice, it shall be cognizable liy the court to which such justice belongs, un- 
less it be in a cnse involving the constitutionality or validity ?f an ordi­
nance, or by-law of a corporation, in which case it shall be cognizable by
the circuit court having jurisdiction over the county or corporation in
which the judgment is rendered. 
~7. Every such appeal shall be tried in a summary way, without plead­
ings in writing. The court trying it sba11 hear all the evidence produced 
by either party, whether the same were produced before the justice from
whose decision the appeal is taken or not, and determine it according to 
the principles of law and equity. If the decision be affirmed, execution
shall issue against the principal and his surety, jointly, or separately, for
the amount of the original judgment, including interest and costs, with
damages on the aggregate, at the rote of ten per ccntum per annum, from
the date of that judgment till payment, and for the costs of the appeal;
and the execution shall be endorsed " no security to be taken." If the
decision be reversed, the appellant shall recover his costs; and such order
or judgment shall be made or given as ought to have been made or given
by the justice. Where the appeal is from an order or judgment under
the fourteenth section, the court shall give such judgment, respecting the
property, the expense of keeping it, and any injury done to it, as may be
equitable among the parties. 
-:18. Either party to an appeal, may give ten days' notice to the other
party, that o. motion will be made to try the appeal, and the court shall,
on the do.y named in the notice, whether at n quarterly or monthly term,
try the appeal, without regard to its place on the docket, unless good cause
be shown by the adverse party for a. continuance, and, if so continued,
shall try it as soon as may be thereafter.

19. Nothing contained in this chapter, in conflict with the act entitled 
an act concerning the jurisdiction of tho mayor's court of the city of

When and hoio sued out;" 
t I. When any suit is instituted for a.ny debt, or for damages for breach
of any contract, on affidavit stating the amount and justice of the claim,
that there is present cause of action therefor, that the defendant or one
of the defendants is not a. residep.t of this state, and that the afliant be­
lieves he has estate or debts due him within the county or corporation in
which the suit is, or that he is sued with n. defendant residing therein, the
plaintiff may forthwith sue out of the clerk's office an attachment against
the estate of the non-resident defendant for the amount so stated. 
2. On affidavit at the time of, or after the institution of any suit, that
the plaintiff's claim is believed to be just, and, where the suit is to recover
specific personal property, stating the nature, and, according to the
affiant's belief, the value of such property, and the probable amount of
damages the plaintiff will recover for the detention thereof, or where it
is to recover money for any claim or damages for any wrong, stating a
certain sum which (at the least) the affiant believes the plaintiff is enti­
tled to, or ought to recover, and an affidavit also, that the affiant believes
that the defendant is removing or intends to remove such specific pro­
perty or his own estate, or the proceeds of the sale of his property, or a
material part of such estate or proceeds out of this state, so that process
of execution on a judgment in said suit, when it is obtained, will be
unavailing, in any such case the clerk shall issue an attachment as the
case may require. If the suit be for specific property, the attachment
may be against the specific property sued for, and against the defendant's
estate for so much as is sufficient to satisfy the probable damages for its
detention; or at the option of the plaintiff, against the defendant's estate 
for the value of such specific property and the damages for its detention.
If the suit be to recover money for a claim, or damages for a wrong, the
attachment shall be against the defendant's estate, for the amount spe­
cified in the affidavit as that which the afflant believes the plaintiff is
entitled to or ought to recover.

when judgment is obtained therefor, should only the ordinary process of 
law be used to obtain such judgment, if such person or bis agent make
oath to the truth of such complaint, to the best of his helief, as well as

son of his suing out the attachment, the said officer shall take possession
of the property specified in the attachment, or where no such property is
specified, of any estate or effects of the defendant, or so much thereof as
is sufficient to pay the plaintiff's claim. When such bond is given, the
fact shall he endorsed on the attachment, or certified by the clerk or jus-
tice to the officer, who shall return the said certificate with the attach-
ment; and the bond, when taken by a justice, shall be returned by him

Attachments in tquity.
11. A claim to any debt, or to damages for breach of any oontraet

debts due him within the same, may, if such claim exceed twenty dollars, 
exclusive of interest, he maintained in any court of equity for a county
or corporation in which there may be any such estate, or a defendant
owing nny debt to such non-resident. When a person has such claim, or
when 8 person claims to be entitled in equity to any money _or property 
from a. person against whom and for which an attachment might be sued
out of a clerk's office, if tho claim were recoverable at Jaw, there may be 
an affidavit according to the nature of the case, confonning as near as its
nature will admit, to what is specified in previous sections ; and such
affidavit may be at the time of or after the institution of the suit. Upon
such affidavit, the plaintiff mny require the clerk to endorse on a sum­
mons an order to the officer to whom it is directed to attach the specific
property (if any be mentioned in the affidavit), and tho debts clue, or to 
become due by other defendants (if any), to the defendant ngainst whom
the claim is, and also any other estate of that defendant, whether in his
own hands or in the hands of other defendants. Any attachment under
this section shall be executed in the same manner, and 8hn11 have tho
same effect as at law, but the proceedings therein shall 1,e the same as in
other suits in chancery. And the court, or in tho vacation thereof, a
judge of a circuit court may interpose by injunction, or the nppointment
of a receiver, or otherwise, to secure the forthcoming of the specific pro­
perty sued for, and so much other estate as will probnbly he required to
satisfy any future order or decree that will be made in the cause."

tion to have the same forthcoming at such time and place as the court
may require; or the defendant, against whom the claim is, may release 
from lny attachment the whole of the estate attached, by giving bond,
with condition to perform the judgment or decree of-the court. The bond, 
in either case, shall be taken by the officer serving the attachment, with
security payable to the plaintiff, and in a penalty in the latter case nt 
least double tho amount or value for which the attachment issued, and 
in the former either double the same, or double the vnlue of the property
retained or returned, at the option of tho person giving it. 
14. Every such bond shall be returned by the officer to, and filed by,
the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending, or to which the attach- 
ment is returnable, and the plaintiff may, within thirty days after the
return thereof, file exceptions to the same, or to the sufficiency of the
security therein. If such exception be sustained, the court shall rule the
said officer to file a good bond, with sufficient security, to be approved by 
it, on or before a certain day to be fixed by the court. If he foil to do so,
be and his sureties in his official bond, shall be liable to the plaintiff as
for a breach of such bond. But the officer shall have the same rights and
remedies against the parties to any bonds so adjudged bad, as if he were
a surety for them. 
15. When any attachment is sued out, either at law or in equity, on
such affidavit as is mentioned in the second or third section, although the
property or estate attached be not replevied as aforesaid, the interests and
profits thereof, pending the suit and before judgment or decree, may be
paid to the defendant, if the court deem it 11roper, and at any time during
such period the court, or a judge of a circuit court in vacation, may dis­
charge the attachment, as to the whole of the estate of the def end ant
against whom the claim is, on his giving bond, with security payable to
the plaintiff, in a penalty double the value of such estate, with condition, 
if judgment or decree be rendered for the plaintiff in said suit, to pay tho
said value, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the same. 
~6. All property, seized under any attachment, and not replevled or
lold before judgment, shall be kept in the sarue manner as similar pro-
perty taken under execution. But such as is expensive to keep or perish-

until the time it is payable, or such other time as the court or judge may
direct, and for the proceeds of sale, bond, with good security, shall be
taken, payable to the officer, for the benefit of the party entitled, and

goods, chattels, money, securities or other effects, belonging to the said 
defendant, the court may order him to pay the amount so due by him,
and to deliver such effects to such person as it may appoint as receiver ,
or such garnishee, with the leave of the court, may give bond, with suffi-
cient security, payable to such person and in such penalty as the court
shall prescribe, with condition to pay the amount due by him, and have
such effects forthcoming, at such time and place as the court may there- 
after require.
18. If any garnishee, summoned as aforesaid, fail to appear in an at- 
tachment at law, the court may either compel him to appear, or hear proof
of any debt due by him to, or of effects in his hands of, the defendant in
such attachment, and make such orders in relation thereto, as if what is
so proved had appeared on his examination. ~ 
19. When it is suggested by the plaintiff in any attachment a.t law,
that the garnishee has not fully disclosed the debts due by him to, or 
effects in his hands of, the defendant in ~uch attachment, the court shall
cause a jury to be impnnncled, without any formal pleading, to enquire 
as to such debts and effects, and proceed, in respect to any such found
by the jury, in the same manner as if they had been confessed hy the
garnishee. If the verdict be in favor of the garnishee, he shall have
judgment for his costs against the plaintiff. 
Order of publication; defence to the auachment ; conflicting claims; and
· judgment. 
20. ,vhen any attachment, except under the third or fourth section, is
returned executed, an order of publication shall be made against the de· 
fondant against whom the claim is, unless he has been served with a copy
of the attachment, or with process in the suit in which the attachment
issued. 
21. Either the defendant in any such attachment, or any garnishee,
or any party to any forthcoming or replevy bond given as aforesaid, or
the officer, who may be liable to the plaintiff by reason of such bond
being adjudged bad, may make defence to such attachment, but tho
attachment shall not thereby be discharged, or the property levied on
released. 
22. The right to sue out any such attachment may be contested; and
when the court is of opinion that it was issued on false suggestions, or
without sufficient cause, judgment shall be entered that the attachment
be abated. When the attachment is properly sued out, and the case
heard upon its merits, if the court be of opinion that the claim of the
plaintiff is not established, final judgment shall be given for the defen­
dant. In either case he shall recover his costs, and there shall be an
order for the restoration to him of the attached effects. 
23. If the claim of the plaintiff be established, judgment or decree
shall be rendered for him, and the court shall dispose of the specific pro­ 
perty mentioned in the second section as may be right, and order the
'sale of nny other effects or real estate, which shall not have been pre· 
viously replevied or sold under this chapter, and direct the proceeds of
sale, and whatever else is subject to the attachment, including what is
embraced by such replovy or forthcoming bond, to be applied in sntisfao- 
tion of the judgment or decree. But no real estate shall be sold, until
all other property and money subject to tho attachment has been ex-
hausted, and then only so much thereof as is necessary to pay the judg-
ment or decree. 
24. But if the defendant, against whom the claim Is, has not appeared
or been served with a copy of the attachment sixty days before such
decree, the plaintiff shall not have the benefit of the preceding section,
unless or until he shall have given bond, with sufficient security, in such 
penalty as the court shall approve, with condition to perform such future
order as may be made upon the appearance of the said defendant and
his making defence. If the plaintiff fail to give such bond, in a reason­
able time, the court shall diepose of the estate attached or the proceeds
thereof, as to it shall seem just. 
25. Any person may file his petition, at any time before the property 1 
attached as tho estate of a defendant is sold, or the proceeds of sale paid §

it be found that the petitioner has title to, or a lien on, or any interest
in, such property .or its proceeds, the court shall make such order as is
necessary to protect his rights; the coats of which enquiry shall be paid
by either party, at the discretion of the court.

or judgment, if he be not so served, petition to have the proceedings re-
heard. On giving security for costs, he shall be admitted to ma!te de-
fence against such judgment or decree, as if he had appeared in the case
before the same was rendered, except that the title of any bona fide pur-
chaser to any property, real or personal, sold under such attachrnent,
shall not be brought in question or impeached. But this section shall not
apply to any case in which the petitioner or his decedent was served with
a copy of the attachment, or with process in the· suit wherein it issued, 
more than sixty days before the (late of the judgment or decree, or to
any case in which he appeared and made defence. 
28. On any rehearing or new trial had under the preceding section tho
court may order the plaintiff in the original suit to restore uny money,
paid to him under such judgment or decree, to the heir or representative
of such defendant as tho same may be the proceeds of real or personal
estate, and enter a judgment or decree therefor against him, or it may
confirm the former judgment or decree; and in either case adjudge the 
costs to the prerniling party. 
Attachments for debts under twenty dollars.
"f--29. .Any creditor whose claim, whether legal or equitable, does not ex- 
eeed twenty dollars, exclusive of interest, upon complaint on oath in the
manner prescribed by the first, second, third and efeventh sections, as the 
case may be, may obtain from any justice of any county or corporation
in which any property or effects of the defendant ma.y be, or in which any 
person indebted to him may reside, an attachment against the estate of 
10 
such defendant, directed to any sheriff, sergeant or constable of his county
or corporation, and returnable before any justice thereof; and thereupon
such proceedings may be had before the justice as would. if the claim ex­
ceeded twenty dollars, be had before a court, except that the proceedings
shall be in all cases without any formal pleading, and an order of publi­
cation need not be published in a newspaper, and the justice shall try
and decide all questions without a jury. All bonds taken under such
attachment shall be filed with the clerk of the court to which the justice
belongs. 
Where damages against plaintiff; or appeal from judgment; h01D
bonds are given in attachment cases. 
30. If, upon defence being made, in any case in which property is
seized under an attachment, that the attachment was sued out without
sufficient cause, it be found either by the court or by the jury, if one be
impanneled, that the defence is well founded, judgment may be entered
for the defendant against the plaintiff for the damages sustained by the
defendant by reason thereof. 
31. Where judgment or decree in favor of the plaintiff is rendered in
any case in which an attachment is sued out, and on appeal therefrom,
an appeal bond is given with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect,
or pay the debt, interest, costs and damages, as well as the costs of the
appeal, the officer in whose custody any attached property may be, shall
deliver the same to the owner thereof. 
How bonds may be given.
32. Any bond authorized or required by any section of this chapter 
may be given either by the party himself, or by any other person,
 Bail required of defendants leaning state ; form of tori: ; wlte1' 
arrest and commitment to be made.
33. If a plaintiff in any action or suit shall by affidavit show to the 
satisfaction of tho court in which it is pending, or to any judge or justice
of the peace, that he has cause of action or suit ago.inst a defendant, and 
that there is probable cause for believing that the said defendant is about
to quit this state, unless he be forthwith apprehended, it shall be lawful
for such court, judge or justice to direct that such defendant shall be held
to bail for such sum as the said court, judge, or justice may think fit;
and thereupon the said plaintiff may sue out of the clerk's office, in such
action or suit, a writ of capias ad respondendum against said defendant,.
the form of which writ shall, in a suit in equity, as well as in an action
at law, be as nearly as may be assimilated to the form of such writ as it
was used at law before the commencement of the Code of Virginia. 
34. Under such capias, the defendant against whom it issues shall be 
arrested and committed to jail, unless bond be given in the sum afore­
said, with sufficient security, that in case there shall in the action or suit 
be any judgment, decree or order, on which a writ of fieri fucias may 
issue, and within four months after such judgment, decree or order, inter- 
rogatories be filed under the fifth section of chapter one hundred and
eighty-eight, with a commissioner of the court wherein such judgment,
decree or order is, the said defendant will at the time the commissioner
issues a summons to answer such interrogatories, be in the county or cor­
poration in which such commissioner may reside, and will within the time
prescribed in such summons file proper answers, upon oath, to such inter­
rogatories, and make such conveyance and delivery as is required by the
said chapter, or in case of failure to file such answers and make such
conveyance and delivery, that the said defendant will perform and satisfy
the said judgment, decree or order. 
How party may proceed to obtain discharge; process to compel dis­
closure of estate. 
35. The defendant arrested under a capias may, at any time pending
the case, give bond to the officer making the arrest. Such bond shall be 
taken by said officer and returned by him to the clerk of the court from
which the capias issued, and the same shall be filed in said clerk's office. 
36. If the defendant give such bond, or be committed to jail for want
of it, the court in which the case is pending, or if it be a circuit court,
the judge thereof in vacation, may, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff
or his attorney or counsel, quash the eapies and discharge the defendant
from custody, or discharge the bond, on being satisfied that there was not
probable cause for believing that the defendant was about to quit the
state; and whether there was such cause or not, mny discharge him from
custody when the plaintiff is cast in the action or suit.
. 37. While a defendant is in custody, whether under an arrest made 
heretofore or hereafter, the plaintiff without having a judgment against
the defendant, may file interrogatories to him in like manner as might be
done under the fifth section of chapter one hundred and eighty-eight, if
such judgment had been obtained and e. fieri facias thereon delivered to
an officer. And the court wherein the case is pending, or a judge of a
circuit court, or a commissioner of a circuit, county or corporation court,
or a justice of the peace, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff or his
attorney or counsel, may discharge a defendant from custody, unless in­
terrogatories be filed within such time as the said court, judge, commis­
sioner or justice may deem reasonable; or though interrogatories be filed,
may discharge him when proper answers thereto are filed and proper con­
veyance and delivery made. A county or corporation court may act
under this or the preceding section, either at a monthly or quarterly term. 
38. The officer making the arrest shall be the officer to whom the con-
veyance shall be made. The interrogatories, answers and report of the
commissioner shall be returned to the court in which the case is pending,
and filed with the papers of such case. And the said court may make
such order as it may deem right as to the sale and proper application of
the estate conveyed and delivered under the preceding section. 
39. Before a capias is sued out of the clerk's office in any action or
suit, the plaintiff in such action or suit or some other person shall file in
the clerk's office bond with security, approved by the clerk, in a penalty
equal to the sum in which the defendant is directed to be held to bail,
payable to said defendant, and conditioned to pay him all costs nnd da­
mages which may be awarded against the plaintiff, or sustained by tho 
defendant by reason of the arrest of the defendant under said capias.

in the t1ubject matter of the suit, but that some third party has a claim 
thereto, and that he does not collude with such third party, but is ready 
to pay or dispose of the sulljcct matter of the action as tho court may
direct, the court may make an order requiring such third party to appear
nnd state the nature of his claim, and maintain or relinquish it, and in
the mean time stay the proceedings in such nction. If such third part.y,
on being served with such order, shall not nppear, tho court may, on proof
of the pluiutiff's right, render judgment for him, and declare such third
party to be forever barred of any claim in respect of the subject matter,
either against the plaintiff, or the original defendant, or his personal re­
presentative, If such third party, on being so served, shall appear, the
court shall allow him to make himself defendant in the n.ction, and, either
in said action or otherwise, cause such issue or issues to be tried as it. may
prescribe, and may direct which party shall be considered the plaintiff in
the issues, and shall give judgment upon t110 verdict rendered on such
trial, or if a jury be waived by the parties interested, shall determine their
claims in a summary way.

issued, claims such property, or the proceeds or value thereof, the circuit
court, or the court of the county or corporation in which the property is
taken, or the judge of such circuit court in vacation, upon the application
of the officer, where no indemnifying bond has been given, or if ono has
been given, on the application of the person who claims such property
and has given such suspending bond ns is herein after mentioned, may 
cuuse to appcnr before such court as well the party issuing such proc<'s~, as
the party making such claim, and such court may exercise, for the decision 
of their rights, all or any of the powers and authority prescribed. in the
preceding section.

of the property or any part thereof, on such terms as the court or judge
may deem advisable, and for the proper application of the proceeds ao-
eordiug to the said rights. In any case before mentioned in this chapter, 
the court may make all such rules and orders, and enter such judgment as 
to costs and all other matters as may be just and proper.

person from whose possession it was taken, as the case may be. If it be 
given, where there has hem no levy, within a rensonable time, or after a
levy, before the property is so restored, it shall be returned within twenty
days to the clerk's office from which the execution issued, or if tho exe-
cution was not issued by a clerk, to the office of the court by which such 
officer was appointed, or in which he qualified.

in a penalty equal to double tho value thereof, payable to said officer,
conditioned to pay to all persons, who may be injured by suspending tho 
sale thereof until the claim thereto can be adjusted, such damages as
they may sustain by such suspension. Upon any such bond as is men-
tioned in this or the preceding section, snit may be prosecuted, in tho
name of the officer, for the benefit of the claimant, creditor, purchaser
or other person injured, and such damages recovered iu said suit as a jury 
may nsse~~. The same may be prosecuted and execution had, in the
name of such officer when he is dead, in like manner 88 if he were alive. 
7. The sheriff or other officer levying a. writ of neri facias or distress
warrant on property. the sale of which is suspended under this chnptcr at 
the instance of n claimant thereof, may, if such claimant desire the pro-
perty to remain in such possession as it was immediately before the levy, 
and if the case be one in which a bond for the forthcoming of the pro­
perty is not prohibited from being taken from the debtor by the sixth sec­
tion of chapter one hundred and eighty-nine, take from the claimant a
bond with sufficient surety, payable to the creditor, with such recital as
is required in a forthcoming bond taken from the debtor, and with condi­
tion that the property shall be forthcoming at such day and place of sale
as may be thereafter lawfully appointed : whereupon, such property may
be permitted to remain at the risk of such claimant in such posseseion as
it was immediately before the levy; and the second, third, fifth, sixth and
seventh sections of chapter one hundred and eighty-nine shall apply to 
such forthcoming bond in like manner as to a forthcoming bond taken 
from the debtor. 
'js. When property, the sale of which is indemnified, sella for more
than enough to satisfy the execution or distress warrant, under which it
is taken, the surplus shall be paid by the officer into the court to tho of­
fice whereof the indemnifying bond is required to be returned, or as such
court may direct. The said court may take such order for the disposi­
tion thereof, either temporarily until the question 88 to the title to the
property .sold is determined, or absolutely, as in respect to the rights of
those interested may seem to it proper.

of the same circuit or district shall, by an order entered in such court, or 
by a warrant directed to the clerk, appoint a special term thereof, and
prescribe in such order or warrant whether a grand jury or any venire is

pointed for it, he may, by warrant under his hand, directed to the clerk
of the court, acljourn it to such other day ea he may deem proper. Such
warrant shall be transmitted by the judge to the clerk, who shall imme-

the same had stood for trial at the next preceding term, and the court had
adjourned without disposing thereof. 
33. At any such special term any civil cause may be tried which could
lawfully have been, but was not tried at the last preceding term that was
or should have been held; and any motion cognizable by such court may 
 
be heard and determined, whether it was pending at the. preceding term
or not; and any criminal cause may be tried at such special term as if it 
were a regular term, and although at the regular term next preceding,
the same may have been continued: and any cause or matter of contro­ 
versy in chancery then ready for hearing, may be heard and determined,
with the consent of the parties to such cause or controversy, although it

or should have been held. Every such special term may be held by the
judge of the circuit; or, if he be dead or absent, by the other judge of
the same circuit or district; or, if neither be present, by any other circuit
jndge who may be present; and it may be held, part of its session by one 
judge and part of it by another: and such special terms may be adjourned

first sit under such exchange; and without a formal exchange of circuits,
if any judge of a circuit court fail to attend a regular term of hie. court,
or be prevented from sitting during the whole term, or be so situated in 
respect to any cause pending in said court, as in his opinion to make it
improper for him to try it, any other circuit judge may hold said court
either for the whole term or any part thereof.

General provisions as to the rules, 
.:::::J. In the clerk's office of every circuit, county and corporation court.
roles shall be held on the first Monday in every month, except when a
term of a circuit court or a quarterly term of a county or corporation
court happens to commence on the first Monday in a month, or either off 
the two following days, or on the preceding Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-
day, Friday or Saturday, the rules which otherwise would have been held
for the said month on the first Monday, shall be held on the last Monday
in the next preceding month ; and, when in any county or corporation,
the said courts shall commence on the Monday before the first Tuesday
of any month, the rules shall in said county or corporation be held on the
Monday before the commencement of said courts. The rules may con-
tinue three days ; but when in any case such continuance would interfere
with the term of the court for which the roles are held, they shall not con-
tinue in such case beyond the day preceding the commencement of the
term of such court. 
2. There shall be a docket of the caaes at rules, wherein the rules shall
be entered; and the books in which rules and orders are entered, in 
chancery cases, sha11 be separate from those in which rnles and orders are
entered in other cases. 
3. When there is no clerk to take a rnle in ~ case, it shall stand con-
tinued until the next rule day after there is a clerk. 
4. The rules may be to declare, plead, reply, rejoin, or for other pro-
ceedings ; they shall be given from month to month. 
Wlun the ,uit will abate or be dismissed. 
5. A defendant may appear at the rule day at which the process against
hi 
. bl if . b bl . th fi I d ft 
m is retuma e, or 1t e returns e m term, at e rat ru e ay a er~;
the return day, and if the declaration or bill be not then filed, may give::
a rnle for the plaintiff to file the same. If the plaintiff' fail to do this at 
the succeeding rule day, or shall, at any time after the defendant's ap-: 
pearance, fail to prosecute his suit, he shall be non-suited, and pay to the
defendant, besides his costs, :five dollars. 
6. If three months elapse after the process is returned executed as to
any one or more of the defendants, without the declaration or bill being
filed, the clerk shall enter the suit dismissed, although none of the de­
fendants may have appeared. 
7. When a summons to answer an action or bill is against a defendant,
h h ffi ( . . . ) kn id  hi ty 
w om t e o cer recemng It ows not to rest e m s conn or corpo-
ration, he shall, unless he :find him therein before the return day, return 
him a non-resident; whereupon, if the court from which such pl'00088
issued have jurisdiction of the case only on the ground of such defen­
dant's residence in such OQunty or corporation, the suit shall ab~te as to 
him. 
General rules as to immaurial allegation.,.
8. It shall not be necessary in any declaration or other pleading to set 
forth th~ place in which any contract was made, or act done, unless when,
from the nature of the case, the place is material or traversable, and
then the allegation may be as to a deed, note or other writing bearing
date at any place, that it was made at such place, or as to any other act,
according to the fact, without averring or suggesting that it was at or in 
the county or corporation in which the action is brought, unless it was in
fact therein. 
9. It shall not be necessary in any action to aver that the cause of
action arose, or that the matter is within the jurisdiction of the court, or
to make profcrt of any deed, letters testamentary or commission of ad­
ministration ; but a defendant may have oyer in like manner as if profert
were made. 
10. All allegations which are not traversable, and which the party
could not be required to prove, may be omitted unless when they are re­
quired for the right understanding of allegations that are material. 
Of the declaration.
I I. No action shall abate for want of form, where the declaration sets 
forth sufficient matter of substance for the court to proceed upon the
merits of the cause. 
12. In actions of trespass, general avermenta that the defendant com­
mitted other wrongs, and that the acts charged were done with force and
arms and against the p;ace, may be omitted; and the plaintiff may
prove all that he could have done if such averments had been inserted in
the declaration. 
13. In every action of assumpeit the plaintiff shall file with his decla­
ration an account stating distinctly the several items of hie claim, unlees
it be plainly described in the deolaratiou.] 
Amended or supplemental bill, bill of revivor and cross bill.
14. The plaintiff may of right amend his declaration or bill before the 
defendant's appearance, and notwithstanding such appearance, a plaintiff 
' 
in equity may, at any time in the vacation of the court wherein the suit
is pending, file in the clerk's office an amended or supplemental bill or 
bill of revivor; whereupon the same proceedings may be had es if leave 
t.o file it had been previously obtained in court, but the court on the mo-
tion of a defendant, made at the term to which process to answer the
1&me is returned executed on him, or if it be returnable to rules, at the
first term after it ie so returned, may dismiss such amended or supple- 
mental bill, or bill of revivor.
15. When a cross bill is filed, the defendants in the first bill shall an- 
swer it, before the defendants in the cross bill are compelled to answer 
that. 
Guardian ad litem to inf ant or in,cme defendant.
16. The proceedings in a suit, wherein an infant or insane person is a 
party, shall not be stayed because of such infancy or insanity, but the
court in which the suit is ponding, or the clerk at rules, may appoint a
guardian ad litem to nny infant or insane defendant, whether such defen-
dant shall have been served with process or not. The court may compel~ 
the person so appointed to act, but he shall not be liable for costs, and
shall be allowed his reasonable charges, which the party on whose motion 
he was appointed shall pay.
Matter of abatement. 
17. No plea. in abatement for a misnomer shall be allowed in ~y ac- 
tion, but in a case wherein, but for this section, a misnomer would have
been pleadnble in abatement, the declaration may, on the defendant's
motion, and on affidavit of the right name, be amended by inserting the
right name. 
18. In other cases, a defendant, on whom the process, summoning
him to answer, appears to have been served, shall not take advantage of
any defect in the writ or return, or any variance in the writ from the de­
claration, unless the same be pleaded in abatement. 
t 19. Where the declaration or bill shows on its face proper matter for
the jurisdiction of the court, no exception for want of such jurisdiction
shall be allowed, unless it be taken by plea in abatement, and the plea 
shall not be received after the defendant has demurred, pleaded in bar,
or answered to the declaration or bill, nor after a rule to plead, or a con-
ditional judgment or decree nisi, 
20. No plea in abatement, for the non-joinder of any person as a co-
defendant, shall be allowed in any action, unless it be stated in the plea 
t.hat such person is a resident of this state, and unless the place of resi-
dence of such person be stated with convenient certainty in an affidavit
verifying the plea. 
21. If u defendant plead in abatement that any other persons ought to
be jointly sued, and at the trial of an issue joined on such plea, it appear 
that tho action could not, by reason of chapter one hundred and forty-
th.rec, or chapter one hundred and forty-nine, be maintained against such 
other persons, or any of them, suoh iasue shall be found against the de,. 
fendant BO pleading.
22. After such plea in abatement, the plaintiff', without prooeeding 1IO 
trial upon an issue thereon, may amend hie declaration, and make the
persons named in such plea as joint contractors, defendants in the cue 
with the original defendants, and cause proeese to be served upen the
new defendants ; and if it appear by the subsequent pleadings in the
action, or at the trial thereof, that all the original defendan~ are liable,
but that one . or more of the other persons named in such plea are not
liable, the plaintiff' shall be entitled to judgment, or to verdict and judg­
ment as the case may be, against the defendants who appear liable; and
such as are not liable, shall have judgment and recover costs as against
the plaintiff', who shall be allowed the same as costs against the def an­
dante who BO pleaded. 
General rules as to pleas and subsequent pleadings.
23. The defendant in any action may plead as many several matters, 
whether of law or fact, as he shall think necessary.
24. In a plea, replication or subsequent pleading, intended to be 
pleaded in bar, or in maintenance of the action, it shall not be necessary to 
use any allegation of "actionem non," or "precludi non," or to the like
effect, or any prayer of judgment. 
25. No party shall be prejudiced by omitting a protestation in any 
pleading.
26. All special traverses, or traverses with an inducement of affirma­ 
tive matter, shall oonclude to the country. But this regulation shall not
preolude the opposite party from pleading over to the inducement when
the traverse is immaterial. 
27. When the plaintiff' takea iasue on the defendant's pleading, or tra­
verses the same or demurs, so that the defendant is not let in to allege
any new matter, the plaintiff may, without giving a rule to i:ejoin, proceed
as if there were a similiter or joinder in demurrer. 
Particularly as to pleas and demurrers.
28. No formal defence shall be required in a plea ; it shall commence 
as follows : " the defendant says that."
29. It shall not be necessary to state in a second or other plea, that it 
is pleaded by leave of the court, or according to the form of the statute,
or to that effect. 
30. The form of a demurrer or joinder in demurrer shall be: "the
defendant ( or plaintiff) says that the declaration ( or plea, &c.) is not ( or
is) sufficient in law." 
31. On a. demurrer (unless it be to a plea. in abatement) the court shall
not regard any defect or· imperfection in the declaration or pleadings,
whether it has been heretofore deemed mispleading or insufficient plead­ 
ing or not, unless there be omitted something so essential to the action or
defence that judgment, according to law and the very right of the cause, 
cannot be given. No demurrer shall be sustained, because of the omis-

e opposite party may e excus om rep ymg, emurnng, or ot erwise 
answering to any pleading which ought to have, but has not, such words
therein, until they be inserted. 
32. A plaintiff in equity may have any plea. or demurrer set down to 
be argued. If the same be overruled, no other plea or demurrer shall
afterwards be received, but there shall be a rule upen the defendant to
answer the bill. 
33. A plaintiff in equity may take issue upon a plea, and have such
issue tried by jury. If the plea be found false, he shall have the same
advantages as if it llad been so found by a verdict at law. 
.Answers and exceptions thereto.
34. At any time before final decree a defendant may be allowed to file 
his answer, but a cause shall not be sent to the rules or continued, because
an answer is filed in it, unless good cause be shown therefor. 
35. When the plaintiff files exceptions to an answer, they shall be set

dant put in a second answer, which is adjudged insufficient, he may be

he believes it to be true. 
Judgment or decree by confession.
41. In any suit a defendant may confess a judgment or decree in the 
olerk's office, for 110 much principal and interest as the plaintiff may be
willing to accept a judgment or decree for. The same shall be entered

so returned, the plaintiff', if he has filed his declaration or bill, may have 
conditional judgment or decree nisi as to such defendant. No service
of such decree nisi or conditional judgment shall be necessary. But at 
the next rule day after the same is entered, if the defendant continue in
default, or at the expiration of any rule upon him with which he fails to 
comply, if the case be in equity, the bill shall be eatered as taken for
confessed as to him, and if it be at law, judgment shall be entered against
him, with an order for the damages to be enquired into, when such en­
quiry is proper. 
"'f-43. Thero need be no such enquiry in an action of debt upon any bond
or other writing for the payment of money, or against the drawer or en­ 
dorsers of a bill of exchange or negotiable note, or in an action of debt
or seire facias upon a judgment or recognizance. 
H<YW office judgment is set aside OT becomes final ; its effect. 
--44. Every judgment entered in the office in a case wherein there is no 
order for an enquiry of damages, and every non-suit or diamission entered
therein, shall, if not previously set aside, become a final judgment, if the 
case be in the general or a circuit court, of the last day of the next term,
(whichever shall happen first), and if it be in 
f
county or corporation court of the last day o the next quarterly term, 
and have the same effect by way of lien or otherwise as a judgment ren­
dered in the court at such term. Every such judgment for any plaintiff'

shall, before it becomes final, appear and plead· to issue, it shall be set
aside, unless an order for enquiry of damages has been executed; in 
which case it shall not be set aside without good cause. Any such issue
may be tried at the same term, unless the defendant s'how good cause for 
continuance.

is adjudged' insufficient, the plaintiff may go on with the subsequent pro-
cess of contempt as if no answer had been filed. 
When a suit in equity may be set for hearing. 
48. A plaintiff in equity may, at or after the rule day at which the 
bill is taken for eonfeesed as to any defendant, or at which his answer is
filed, have the cause set for hearing as to such defendant ; and it may be 
BO set for hearing on the answer, or upon a general replication thereto, as
the plaintiff may prefer. ff four months elapse after the answer of a de­
fendant is filed, without the case being so set, and without exceptions being
filed to his answer, he may have the case set for hearing as to himself. 
Where a ccue is ready only aa lo part of defendanu.
49. Where, in an action against two or more defendants, the process 
is served on part of them, the plaintiff may proceed to judgment as to any
so served, and either discontinue it as to the others, or from time to time, 
as the process is served as to such others, proceed to judgment as to them
until judgments be obtained against all. 
:::&a. ff a suit in equity be set for hearing as to any defendant, it shall
be heard as to him, unless his interests be so connected with those of:
other defendants in the suit, that it would. be improper to decide upon
their interests separately. And though there be such connection, a de-
fendant as to whom the case has been set for hearing, may have an order
upon the plaintiff to use due diligence to mature the cause for hearing as
to the other defendants, and, unless it be so matured within such time as
the court may deem reasonable, shall be entitled to a hearing or dismis-
sion of it as to him.

8. Whfln plea or eetoff' goes to part only of
demand. 
9. Defendant clnlmlnt a 11etoff' put on the
footlng of a plalntUf. 
I. In any action of debt, the defendant may plead payment of the
debt ( or of so much as is due by the condition) before action brought. 
2. In any personal action, the defendant may pay into court to the
clerk a sum of money on account of what is claimed, or by way of com-
pensntion or' amends, and plead that he is not indebted to the plaintiff 
( or that tho plaintiff has not sustained damages) to a greater amount
than the said sum. 
3. The plaintiff may accept the said sum either in full satisfaction, and 
then have judgment for his costs, or in part satisfaction, and reply to the
plea generally, and if issue thereon be found for the defendant, judgment
shall be given for the defendant, and he shall recover his costs. 
4. In a suit for any debt, the defendant may at the trial prove, and
b 11 d . h d b ff hi h . d 
ave a owe agamst sue e t, any payment or seto w ic 1s so e-
scribed in his plea, or in an account filed therewith, as to give the plaintiff 
notioe of its nature, but not otherwise. Although the claim of the plain­
tiff be jointly against several persons, and the setoff is of a debt not t.o
all but only to a part of them, this section shall extend to such setotf, if
it appear that the persons, against whom such claim is, stand in the relation
of principal and surety, and the person entitled to the set.off' is the prin­ 
eipal.s
5. In any action on a contract, the defendant may file a plea, alleging 
any such failure in the consideration of the contract, or fraud in its pro­
curement, or any such breach of any warranty to him of the title or the
sonndnesa of personal property, for the price or value whereof he entered
into the contract, as would entitle him, either to recover damages at law
from the plaintiff', or the person under whom the plaintiff' claims, or t.o 
relief in equity, in whole or in part, against the obligation of the contraot;
or if the contract be by deed, alleging any such matter existing before
its execution, or any such mistake therein, or in the execution thereof, aa
would entitle him to such relief in equity ; and in either case alleging the
amount to which he is entitled by reason of the matters contained in the
plea. Every such plea shall be verified by affidavit. 
6. If a defendant, entitled to such plea. as is mentioned in the prece-
ding section, shall not tender it, or though he tender it, if it be rejected 
for not being offered in due time, he shall not be precluded from such
relief in equity as he would have been entitled to if the preoeding section
had not been enacted. If any such plea be rejected by the court as bad,
or adjudged insufficient on demurrer, or if, when issue in fact is joined
thereon, such issue be found against the defendant, he shall be barred of
relief in equity upon the matters alleged in the plea, unless upon such
ground as would entitle a party to relief against a judgment in other 
cases. Every such issue in fact shall be upon a, general replication that 
the plea is not true ; and the plaintiff' may give in evidence, on such issue,
any matter which could be given in evidence under a special replication,
if such replication were allowed. 
7. Nothing in this chapter shall impair or affect the obligation of any
bond or other deM deemed voluntary in law upon any party thereto, or
his representatives. 
8. If the defendant file a plea or account of setoff which covers or ap­
plies to part of the plaintiff's demand, judgment may be forthwith ren­
dered for the part not controverted and the costs accrued until the filing
of the plea or account, and the case shall be proceeded with for the resi­
due, as if the part for which judgment was rendered had not been in­
cluded therein. And if, in addition to such plea or account, the defen­
dant plead some other plea, going to the whole or residue of the demand, 
the case shall not be continued 88 to the part not controverted by the plea
or account of setoft's, unless the additional plea. be also verified by affidayit,
or good cause be shown for such continuance. 
9. A defendant who files a plea or account under this chapter shall be
deemed to have brought an action against the plaintiff (at the time of§l;eo. 
filing the same), for the matters mentioned in such plea or account, and
the plaintiff shall not, after the plea or account is filed, dismiss his case
without the defendant's consent, but shall be entitled to every ground of
defence against the defendant's demand, of which he might have availed 
hi If b ·a1 l h . . . b h . 
imse y any speer p ea or ot erwrse m any action roug t aguinst
him upon the same demand. On the trial of the issue in such case, the
jury shall ascertain the amount to which the defendant is entitled, and 
apply it as a setoff against the plaintiff;s demand, and, if the said amount
be more than the plaintiff is.entitled to, shall ascertain the amount of the
excess, and fix the time from which interest is to be computed on the
same, or any part thereof. Judgment, in such case, shall be for the de­
fendant against the plaintiff for said excess, with such interest from the
said time till payment.

person or persons to whom a commission is so directed, may administer
an oath to the witness, and take and certify the deposition with his official
seal annexed; and if he have none, then the genuineness of his signature
shall be authenticated by some officer of the same state or country, under
his official seal, unless the deposition is taken by a justice out of this 
state but in the United States ; in which case his certificate shall be re­
ceived without any seal annexed, or other authentication of his signature.

trial, or in any public office or service the duties of which prevent his at-~ 
tending the court, or be unable to attend it from sickness or other infirmity,~~~~-~
or be more than a hundred miles from the place of trial. Bot where the 
only ground of reading a deposition is, that the witness is more than a hun-
dred miles from the place of trial, on motion to the court, before the com-
mencement of the trial, it may, for good cause shown, require such wit-
ness to attend in person. 
33. When a deposition bas been filed, if not read on the trial by the
party taking it, it may be rend by the other party. 
34. In any case wherein there has been a judgment, decree or order,
from or to which an appeal, writ of error or supersedeas has been, or 
might be allowed, a deposition may be taken for any -party to suoh case
or for or against his or her husband, personal representative, heirs or de-
visoes, in like manner, and by such persons, as is before prescribed for
pending cases ; and it may be read in any future trial that may be di-
rected, if the same could properly be read had there been no such judg-
ment, decree or order.

35. A person desirous of perpetuating the testimony of witnesses 88 to 
n matter in respect to which there is no suit, may file with a commissioner

timony, such bill might be filed, a petition stating such matter, and what
persons may he affected by the testimony. Whereupon the commissioner
shall appoint for proceeding on the petition a time and place, whereof
reasonable notice shall be given to the persons who may be so affected.
If any of them be an infant or insane person, the commissioner shall ap­
point a guardian ad litem to attend on his behalf. At such time and
place the commissioner shall take in writing the evidence of any witnesses
adduced in respect to the said matter by the petitioner, or by the person
so affected. He may ncljourn from time to time, and shall return a re­
port of bis proceedings, with the testimony taken by him, to the clerk's
office of the court by which he was appointed, and such testimony shall
have the same effect as if it had been taken on a bill to perpetuate testi­
mony. Such court mny mnke such order as to the costs as may seem to 
it right. 
Allowance to witnesses f o-r attendance.
36. A person attending 88 a witness under a summons, shall have fifty

yond ten miles necessarily traveled to the plooo of attendance, and the!~~
same for returning, besides the tolls at the bridges and· ferries which he
ik h O hi th f h 
crosses, or turnpi e gates e may pass. n 1s oa on entry o t e anrn
he is entitled to, and for what, and by what party it is to be paid, shall be 
made, when the attendance is before either house, or a committee of the
general assembly, by the clerk of such house or committee, and in other
cases by the clerk of the court in which the case is, or the person before·
whom the witness attended. A witness summoned to attend in several
cases may have the entry made against either of the parties by whom be
is summoned ; but no witness shall be allowed for his attendance in more
than one case at the same time. 
37. The sum to which a witness is entitled shall be paid out of the
treasury in any case of attendance before either house or a committee of 
the general assembly, and in any other case in which the attendance is
for the commonwealth, except where it is otherwise specially provided.
In all other cases it shall be paid by the party for whom the summons
issued. The payment shall be on a certificate of the person required by
the preceding section to make the entry. The certificate shall exprest1
by letters and not by figures, the separate amounts to which the witnese
is entitled for his attendance, traveling and tolls and ferriages which he
may have to pay, and the aggregate thereof. No clerk or other person
authorized to make such entry, or give such certificate, shall become in­
terested by purchase in any claim payable out of the public treasury,
which by law he is authorized to certify. And it shall be the dutyof such
clerk, immediately after the expiration of sixty days from the adjournment
of any court, to make out a list of all entries made, on behalf of witnesses
attending for the commonwealth, and certify such list to the auditor of
public accounts. Any dispute (before or after issuing the certificate) be-­
tween the witness and the party against whom his claim is made, 1111 to its
justice or amount, may, when the ease is in a court or before ajusticc, be
determined by such court or justice. 
38. The court or justice may restrict the taxation in the costs for wit- 
b d d . 11,.T ti . I II
nesses, to so many as may e eeme just, ..1., o entry or a witness s ,a

such party; and in no case shall there be an entry of a witness for atten­
dance at a term, after sixty days from the end of such term. 
Compelling party to discocer or produce a document.
39. In a case at law, a party may file in the clerk's office, and in a 
ease or matter before a commissioner of a court, any person interested
may file with such commissiouer interrogatories to any adverse party or
claimant. The clerk or commissioner shall issue a summons, directed as
prescribed in the second section of chapter one hundred nod seventy, re­
quiring the officer to summon the proper party to answer said interroga-
tories, and make return thereof within such time, not exceeding sixty
days, as may be prescribed in the aummons. ,vith the sumrnona, there
shall be a copy of the interrogatories, which shall ho delivered to the per­ 
son served with the sununons, at the time of such service; if the sum­ 
mons be against a plaintiff who is not a resident of this state, tho service
may be on his attorney at law. ,vhcn the court in which the ease is, or
whose commissioner issued the summons, is satisfied that the interrogato- 
ries are relevant, and such as the person to whom they are propounded,
would be bound to answer upon a bill for discovery, and sees also that the
interrogatories have not been unreasonably delayed, it may, if the said
person do not, in a reasonable time, file answers thereto upon oath, or, if
be file answers which are evasive, attach him and compel him to answer
in open court, or to answer more explicitly. It may, also, if it see fit, set
aside a plea of his, and give judgment against him by default, or, if he
be plaintiff, order his suit to be dismissed with coats, or, if he be claiming
a debt before a commissioner, disallow such claim. Answers to such in­
terrogatories may be used as evidence at the trial of the cause, in the same
manner and with the same effect as if obtained upon a bill of discovery. 
40. In any case at law, a party may file in the clerk's office, and in
any case or matter before a commissioner of a court, any person in- 
~rested may file with such commissioner an affidavit, setting forth that
there is, he verily believes, a book of accounts or other writing, in pos- 
session of an adverse party or claimant, containing material evidence for
him, specifying with reasonable certainty such writing, or the part of
such book. The clerk or commissioner shall issue a summons, directed
as under the preceding section, requiring him to summon the proper party
to produce such writing, or an exact copy of such part of the said book,
and make return thereof as under that section. ,vith the summons,
there shall be a copy of the affidavit, which shall be delivered to the per-
son served with the summons at the time of such servlce ; if the summons
be against a plaintiff who ie not a resident of this state, the service may
be on his attorney at law. ,vhen the court in which the case is, or whose
commissioner issued the summons, is satisfied that tho person filing such
affidavit has no means of proving the contents of such writing, or of
such part of the book, but by the person summoned producing what is
required by the summons, and that· the same is relevant and material,
and sees also that the call therefor has not been unreasonably delayed, it
may, unlesa the person summoned shall, in a reasonable time, either pro-
duce what is so required, or answer in writing, upon oath, that he has not
under his control such book or writing, or any of the like import, attach
him and compel him to do the one or the other. It may, also, if it see
fit, set aside a plea of such person, and give judgment against him by
default, or, if he be plaintiff, order his suit to be dismissed, with costs, or,
if he be claiming a debt before a commissioner, disallow such claim. 
41. The two preceding sections shall not preclude a person who doe~
net file such interrogatories or affidavit, from exhibiting his bill in 
chancery for a discovery, as he might have done if th1 said sections had
not been enacted. But a person filing such interrogatories or affidavit,
shall not afterwards exhibit a bill in equity against the same party for the
discovery or production of the same matters. 
Effect of evidence of party's absence for seven years.
42. If any person who shall have resided in this state go from, and do 
not return to, the state for seven years successively, he shall be presumed
to be dead in any case wherein his death shall come in question, unless 
proof be made that he was alive within that time.
43. If the person so presumed to be dead be found to have been living, 
any person injured by snob presumption shall be restored to the right.a of 
which he shall have been deprived by reason of such presumption.
Excluding eoidenee for want of particulars of claim or defence. 
4t. In any action or motion, the court may order a statement to be
filed of the particulars of the claim, or of the ground of defence ; and if
a party fail to comply with such order, may, when the case is tried or
heard, exclude evidence of any matter not described in the notice, decla­
ration or other pleading of such party so plainly as to give the adverse
party notice of its character. 
Evidence in 1nitigation of damages,
45. In any action for defamation, the defendant may justify by alleg­ 
ing and proving that the words spoken or written were true, and ( after
notice in writing of hie intention to do so, given to the plaintiff at the
time of, or for pleading to such action), may give in evidence, in mitiga­
tion of damages, that he made or offered an apology to the plaintiff for
such defamation before the commencement of the action, or as soon af­
terwards as he had an opportunity of doing so, in case the action shall
have been commenced before there was an opportunity of making or
offering such apology.

cedent, for which he does not appear to have made out fee bills in his
lifetime ; except that such of these aa appear to said successor to be for
more than is allowed by law, shall be reduced by him so far as, in his 
judgment, is necessary, to make them legal.
22. The fee bills made out under the preceding section shall show on 
their face that they are for fees due the decedent, and shall be signed by
his successor, and delivered to the personal representative of such dece- 
dent, as soon as practicable. Such successor shall receive, for his ser-
vices under this and the preceding section, such compensation as the
court, whereof he is clerk, shall adjudge to be reasonable, which shall be
paid by said personal representative, or by the officer who may collect
said fee hills, out of the first proceeds of said collection. 
23. In any case in which fees are chargeable by a clerk, for services
performed before the first day of July next, the person entitled to said
fees, although not reappointed clerk, shall after that day have free access
to the books and papers in the clerk's office, for the purpose of making
entries in a fee book and making out fee bills for said services, and shall
have the same power to make out and sign such fee bills, and tho same 
means to enforce the collection thereof, and the same remedy against
officers for failing to collect and account for said fee bills, as if said per-
son wore still in the office of clerk." 
How fee bills are collected and accounted for.
::::::24. Any officer mentioned in this chapter, or the personal representa- 
___________________________ 
tive of a deceased clerk, may, after the first day of January, and before
the first day of August in any year, deliver fee bills, duly signed, to any
sheriff or collector of the public taxes, who shall receive and endeavor to 
collect the same. A sheriff or collector may distrain therefor or for any
bills due himself, such property of the person to whom the fees are charged,
as might be levied on, under a writ of fieri facias against him, except as
herein after mentioned: and the ninth, tenth. and eleventh sections of the
thirty-sixth chapter shall apply to such fee bills in like manner as to taxes.
-::::.25. Every sheriff' or collector to whom such fee bills are so delivered, 
shall, on or before the :fifteenth day of December next after such deli-
very, account therefor with the officer or personal representative entitled
thereto, by returning such as he may not have collected, with an endorse­
ment thereon that the person charged with the fees has no estate in his
county or corporation, out of which the same could be made, and by pay­ 
ing to such officer or representative the amount of all not so returned,
deducting a. commission for himself of seven and a. half per centum on
said amount. If he fail so to do, judgment may be obtained, on motion,
against said sheriff or collector and his sureties, and his and their per­
sonal representatives, or against any deputy who may have signed the
receipt for said fees, or his personal representative, for the amount with
which such sheriff, collector or deputy is chargeable, and damages thereon
not exceeding fifteen per centum per annum, from the said fifteenth day
of December till payment. Such judgment may be, on motion in the cir­
cuit, county or corporation court, of the county or corporation in which
said sheriff or collector resides, and if the fees be due to the clerk of the
court of appeals held at the seat of government, it may be in any circuit,
county or corporation court there holden. On such motion, any receipt
for fees mentioned in the notice, as signed by any person, shall be deemed 
to be his signature, unless an affidavit be filed denying it.
26. No fee bill shall be collected by distress, warrant or suit, after five 
years from the end of the year in which the service was performed that
is charged therein, unlesa, within fire years before the institution of such 
proceeding, it was returned by an officer, with such endorsement thereon
(properly dated) as is mentioned in the preceding section. 
27. An officer or witness to whom, for fees or attendance, any thing is
due that is taxed in costs for which there is judgment or decree, may,
within one month after such judgment or decree, lodge in the clerk's
office of the court wherein the same is rendered, his fee bills for such fees,
or certificate for such attendance. The amount due each officer or wit­
ness for what is so lodged, shall, and the amount due the clerk himself
for fees so included, may, within the said month, be noted in the margin
of the order or execution book, opposite the entry of the case. An officer
or witness, whose fees or certificate may be so noted, shall be paid the 
same out of the costs, by the person against whom the judgment or de­
cree is; and the right to such payment shall be valid against any assignee
of the judgment or decree. When the clerk issues execution in such case,
he shall endorse thereon how much of said costs is for each officer or wit­
ness whose fees or certificate may be so noted ; and the officer collecting
said costs, shall pay the same accordingly to those entitled thereto. 
28. No officer mentioned in this chapter shall be obliged to perform
. f id f th" 1 f hi " " 
services or a non-resi ent o is state, un eBB payment o 18 ,ees ,or
said services be secured ; nor to perform services for any person againBt 
whom he has had fee bills returned which remain unaatisfied, unless he
be secured payment of his fees for the eervieee desired, or performance of
laid services be directed by a court. 
29. Each clerk of the court of appeals shall annually render to the
auditor of public accounts an account of all money received by him within

1. A poor person may be allowed hy a court to sue or defend n. suit 
therein, without paying fees or costs; whereupon he shall have, from any
counsel whom the court may assign him, and from all officers, all needful
services and process, without any fees to them therefor, except what may
be included in the costs recovered from the opposite party. 
Security for costs.
2. In any suit ( except where such poor person is plaintiff) there may 
be a suggestion on the record in court, or ( if the case be at rules) on the
role docket, by a defendant or any officer of the court, that the plaintiff 
. id f hi d h    d f hi A "' 
ts not a resi ent o t is state, an t at security 1s require· o rm. After
sixty days from such suggestion, the suit shall, by order of the court, be 
dismissed, unless before the dismiesion the plaintiff be proved to be a resi-
dent of the state, or security be given before said court or the clerk
thereof, for the payment of the costs and damages which may be awarded
to the defendant, and of the fees due, or to become due, in such suit, to
the officers of the court. The security shall be by bond payable to the 
commonwealth; but there need only be one obligor therein, if he be suf-
ficient. The court, before which or before whose clerk such bond is given,
may, on motion by a defendant or officer, give judgment for so much as
he is entitled to, by virtue of said bond. 
3. On the motion of an obligor in such bond, after reasonable notice
to the plaintiff, his attorney at law or agent, the court may order bond to 
be given, with sufficient security, in a penalty equal to the penalty of
the former bond, payable to the applicant, and conditioned to indemnify
and save harmless the applicant against all loss or damage, in conse-
quence of executing the former bond. If the bond, required under this
section, be not given within such time as the court may prescribe, it may
order the suit to be dismissed.

any interlocutory order or proceeding, tho court may give or refuse costs,

murrer is sustained to a plea in abatement, give judgment for the plaintiff
for bis full costs to the time of sustnining it, an attorney's fee only ex-
cepted; and when any other part of the pleading is a<ljudged insufficient, 
order all costs occasioned by such insufficient pleading to be paid by him
who committed the fault. 
5. The party to whom a new trial is granted shall, previous to such
new trial, pay the costs of the former trial, unless the court enter that§ 
the new trial is granted for misconduct of the opposite party, who, in
such case, may he ordered to pay any costs which seem to the court rea-
sonable. If the party who is to pay the costs of the former trial, fail to
pay the same at or before the next term after the new trial is granted,
the court may, on the motion of the opposite party, set aside the order
granting it, and proceed to judgment on tho verdict, or award execution
for said costs, as may seem to it best. 
6. In any personal action not on contract, if a verdict be found for the
plaintiff, on an issue or otherwise, for less damages than ten dollars, lie 
shall not recover, in respect to such verdict, nuy emits, unless the court
enter of record that the ohject of the action was to try a right, besides 
the mere right to recover damages for the trespass or grievance in respect
of which the action wns brought, or thnt the said trespass or grievance
was willful or malicious. 
7. In any personal action on contract, wherein it is ascertained that

seem right.

dants, unless the court enter of record that there was reasonable cause
for making defendants, those for whom there is such judgment, or as to 
whom there is such discontinuance (and order otherwise), they shall re­
cover their costs. 
9. When a suit is in the name of one person for the benefit of any 
other, if there be judgment for the defendant's costs, it shall be against
such other. 
IO. The laws of costs shall not be interpreted as penal laws ; nor shall
any thing in this chapter take away or abridge the discretion of a court

judgment be not in his court or office, an authenticated abstract of it.
In such docket there shall be stated, in separate columns,' the date and
amount of the judgment, the date of docketing it, the alternative value
of any specific property recovered hy it, and the amount and date of any
credits on the judgment, with the names, description and residence of
the parties so far as they appear in his office or in such abstract. Every

ment of the term at which it was so rendered, except as follows : 
7. A.judgment rendered before the commencement of this act shall, 
as against a. purchaser or creditor, claiming under a. deed made or judg­

on the day before this chapter takes effect. 
8. No judgment shall be a lien on real estate as against a purchaser
thereof for valuable consideration without notice, unless it be docketed 
according to the third and fourth sections of this chapter, in the county
or corporation wherein such real estate is, either within a year next after·
the date of such judgment, or ninety days before the conveyance of said
estate to such purchaser. 
f9. The lien of a judgment may always be enforced in a court of equity.
If it appear to such court that the rents and profits of the real estate,
subject to the lien, will not satisfy the judgment in five years, the court
may decree the said estate or any part thereof to be sold, and the pro­
ceeds applied to the discharge of the judgment. 
IO. Where the real estate liable to the lien of o. judgment is more than
sufficient to satisfy the same, and it or any part of it has been aliened, as
between the allenees for value, that which was aliened last shall, in equity,
be first liable, anc.l so on with other successive alienations, until the whole 
judgment is satisfied. And as between alieuees who are volunteers under

person ; and as against purchasers for valuable consideration withou~
notice, and creditors, shall bind what it may be levied on only from the
time that the writ is delivered to the officer to be executed. 
t 12. If the levy be upon gold or silver coin, the same shall be accounted
for at its par value as so much money made under the execution. If it
be upon bank notes, and the creditor will not take them at their nominal
value, they shall be sold and accounted for as any other property taken 
under execution.
13. Every officer shall endorse on each writ of fieri facias the year,

under a new advertisement, or return that tho property was not sold for
want of bidders. If, on a resale, the property be sold for less than it
sold for before, the first purchaser shall be liable for the difference to the
creditor, so far as is required to satisfy him, and to the debtor for the
balance. This section shall not prevent the creditor from proceeding aa
he might have done if it had not been enacted.

surplus remain in his hands after satisfying the execution, such surplus
shall be repaid to the debtor ; and if the debtor or his personal repre- 
sentative, obtain an injunction or auperaedeae to an execution, in whole
or in part, before money received under it, or any part of it, is paid over

right of action on such bond, the person having such judgment or execu- 
tion, or his personal representative may, by scire facias, or motion after
reasonable notice to the person, or the personal representative of the
person, against whom the judgment or execution was, obtain a new exe­
cution against him in the latter case, for the amount for which the pro­

5. To ascertain the estate on which a writ of fieri fucias is a lien, and 
to ascertain any real estate in or out of this state, to which a debtod~tt~:
named in such fieri faeiae is entitled, the judgment creditor may file inter-
rogatories to the debtor, and a copy of the judgment, with a commissioner 
of the circuit, county or corporation court, who shall issue a summons as
in the cases provided for by the thirty-ninth§ section of chapter one hun-
dred and seventy-six, except that it shall not be served out of the county
or corporation in which the commissioner resides. The debtor served
with such summons shall, within the time prescribed therein, file answers
upon oath to said interrogatories. If he fail so to do, or file any answers 
which are deemed by the commissioner to be evasive, the commissioner, 
after the service and return day of a notice to or a role upon the debtor,
issued by such commissioner, and returnable to a day and place indicated
in the process, to show cause against it, may issue any attachment against
such debtor, returnable before him on a day and place certain, set out in
it, to compel such debtor to answer before the commissioner the interro­
gatories aforesaid, or any others which he may deem pertinent. But the
said commissioner shall enter in his proceedings and report to the court,
any and all the objections taken by such debtor against answering such
interrogatories, or any or either of them ; and if the court shall after­
wards sustain any one or more of such objections, the answers given to
such interrogatories as to which objections are sustained, slmll ha hold for
naught in that or any other cause. 
6. Any real estate out of this state, to which it may appear by such
answers the debtor is entitled, shall be forthwith conveyed by him to the 
officer to whom was delivered the said fieri faeias ; and any money, bank
notes, securities, evidences of debt or other personal estate, which it may 
appear by such answera are in the possession or under the control of the
debtor, shall be delivered by him, as far as practicable, to the same officer,
or to such other, and in such manner as may be ordered by the court,
when the answers are in court, or by the commissioner when the answers
are not in court. Unless such conveyance and delivery be made, a. writ
shall be issued by the court's order, or if the answers be not in court, by
the commissioner, directed to the sheriff of any county or the sergeant of
any corporation, requiring such sheriff' or sergeant to take the debtor and
keep him safely, until he shall make such conveyance and delivery; upon
doing which he shall be discharged by the court under whose order the
writ issued, or if the answers were not in court, by the court by which the
commissioner was appointed, or in either case, if the court be not sitting, 
by the commissioner.
7. Tho commissioner shall return the interrogatories and answers filed 
with him, and a report of the proceedings under the two preceding sec­
tions, to the court in which the judgment is, or if the judgment be of a
justice, to the court to which such justice belongs. 
8. Where a debtor named in a writ of fieri faolaa, after being served
with a. summons issued by a commissioner, shall fail, within the time pre­
scribed therein, to file answers upon oath to said interrogatories, or shall
file answers which are deemed by the commissioner to be evasive, if the
judgment creditor shall by affidavit show to the satisfaction of the com­
missioner that there is probable cause for believing that the said debtor is
about to quit this state, unless he be forthwith apprehended, a writ shall
be issued by the commissioner, directed to the sheriff of any county or
the sergeant of any corporation, requiring such sheriff or sergeant to take
the debtor, and keep him safely, until such answers to the interrogatories
as the commissioner deems proper shall be filed, and such conveyance and
delivery as he deems proper shall be made, or until a circuit, county or
corporation court or a circuit judge shall direct the debtor's discharge. A 
county or corporation court may act under this section, either at a monthly
or quarterly term. 
As to recovery, sale and application of debtor', estate,
9. Any order may be made by such court which it may deem right, 88 
to the sale and proper application of the estate conveyed and delivered
under sections six and aeven.  
IO. Real estate conveyed to an officer under this chapter, shall, unless
saeh oourt direct otherwise, be sold after such notice as in the case
slaves levied on, and be conveyed to the purchaser by the officer or his 
deputy. An officer to whom there is delivery under this chapter, when!~·
the delivery is of money, bank notes, or any goods or chattels, shall dis- 
pose of the same as if levied on by him under a fieri facias; and when
the delivery is of evidences of debts (other than such bank notes), may 
r.eceive payment of such debts within sixty days after such delivery.
Any evidence of debt or other security remaining in his hands at the end
of said sixty days, shall be returned by him to the clerk's office of such
court. For a failure to make such return, he may be proceeded against
as if an express order of said court for such return bad been disobeyed. 
II. On a suggestion by the judgment creditor that by reason of tho
lien of his writ of fieri facias, there is a liability on any person other
than the judgment debtor, a summons may be sued out of the said office 
against said person to answer such suggestion ; the return day of which
summons may be the next term of the court, although more than ninety
days after the date of the summons. 
12. The person summoned shall be examined on oath. If it appear
on such examination that there is any such liability on him, tho court
may order him to pay any debts, or deliver any estate for which there
such liability, or pay tho value of such estate, to any officer whom it may
designate ; nnd the levy of an execution on such order shall be valid,
although levied by such officer. 
13. If such person, after being served with the summons twenty days,
fail to appear, or if it be suggested that he has not fully disclosed his 
liability, the proceedings shall be according to the eighteenth and nine-
teenth sections of chapter one hundred and fifty-one, mutatis mutandis. 
14. Any person summoned under the eleventht section, may, before the
return day of the summons, deliver and· pay to the officer serving it, what 
he is liable for; and the officer shall give a receipt for, and make return
of, what is so paid and delivered. 
15. Unless such person appear to be liable for more than is so delivered
and paid, there shall be no judgment ago.inst him for costs. In other 
cases, judgment under the twelfth and thirteentht: sections may be for
such costs, and against such party, as the court may deem just. 
16. For the recovery of any estate, real or personal, on which a writ
of fieri facias is a lien under this chapter, or on which the judgment on 
which such writ issues, is a lien under chapter one hundred and eighty-
six, or for the enforcement of any liability in respect to any such estate,
a suit may be maintained at law or in equity, as the case mny require, in
the name of the officer to whom such writ was delivered, or in the name
of any other officer who may be designated for the purpose by an order
of the court in which the judgment is, or if the judgment be of a justice, 
by an order of the court to which such justice belongs. No officer shall
be bound to bring such suit, unless bond with sufficient security be given
him to indemnify him against all expenses and costs which he may incur
or become liable for by reason thereof. But any person interested may 
bring such suit at his own costs in the officer's name.
17. An officer receiving money under this chapter shall, within thirty 
days after receiving it, make return thereof to the court or the clerk's
office of the court in which the judgment is, or to which, if it was ren­
dered by a justice, such justice belongs, and for failing so to do, shall be
liable as if he had acted under an order of said court. After deductimg
from said money a commission of five per cent. and his necessary expenses
and costs, including reasonable fees to counsel, he shall pay the net pro­
ceeds, and he and his sureties and their representatives shall be liable
therefor, in like manner as if the same had been made under a writ of
fieri facias on the judgment, returnable at the end of said thirtr days  
.As to creditor's right to issue other executions,
18. Although a judgment creditor avail himself of the benefit of this 
chapter, he may nevertheless (without impairing his lien under it), from
time to time, according to chapters one hundred and eighty-six and one
hundred and eighty-seven, issue other executions upon his judgment
until the same be satisfied.
