they may be intelliginy distinguished.

it shall appear upon the face thereof, either: First, That the
court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, or
the subject of the action; or, Second, That the plaintiif has
not legal capacity to sue; or, Third, That there is another
action pending between the same parties, for the same cause,
in this State; or, Fourth, That there is a defect of parties,
plaintiff or defendant; (a) or, Fafth, That several causes of
action have been improperly united; or, Sixth, That the petition does not state facts squicient to constitute a cause of
action; (1)) or, 'event/t, That a party, plaintid‘ or defendant,

action.

may be disregarded.

the clerk of the circuit court of the county where the proceedings were had.

SEC. 8. The notice shall state the time and place of applying for the injunction, and shall be proved by the return
of an ofiicer, the evidence of a witness,'or the acknowledgment of the adverse party, his agent_or attorney, endorsed
thereon.

SEC. 9. No injunction shall be granted to stay any ‘
judgment or proceeding, except so much of the recovery ;
or cause of action as the plaintiif shall show himself equi '

tany entitled to be relieved against, and so much as will
cover costs.

SEC. 10. Every such injunction shall operate as a release of all errors in the proceedings that are prayed to be 1
enjoined.

SEC. 11. No injunction (unless on final hearing or judgment) shall issue in any case until the plaintiff execute a
bond, with suflicient security, to the other party, in such sum
as the court or judge shall deem sufficient to secure the
amount or other matter to be enjoined, and all damages that
may be occasioned by such injunction, conditioned that the
plaintiif will abide the decision which shall be made thereon,
and pay all sums of money, damages and costs, that shall be
adjudged against him, if the injunction shall be dissolved.

SEC. 12. Such bond shall be filed with the clerk of the
circuit court of the county to which the injunction is returnable, and the bond may be entered into before said clerk, if

the court or judge granting the injunction shall first approve
of the security.

SEC. 13. Upon the dissolution of an injunction, in whole.
or in part, damages shall be assessed by a jury, or, if neither
party require a jury, by the court; but if money, or any proceedings for the collection of any money or demand, shall
have been enjoined, the damages thereon shall not exceed

ten per centum on the amount released by the dissolution,
exclusive of legal interest and costs.

SEC. 14. The court shall enter judgment against the
obligors in the bond, according to the circumstances of the
case, including the damages so assessed, and may award exe 

cution thereon, or otherwise enforce such judgment, according
to the rules and practice of the court.

SEC. 15. When an injunction to stay proceedings is
prayed in the same court where the proceedings were bad, no
notice of the application shall be necessary unless prescribed
by rules of court.

SEC. 16. When any application for an injunction shall
be overruled by a county court, or by any two justices thereof, or by the judge of the circuit court, in vacation, such
county court, or justices, or judge, shall grant to the defend‘
ant a certificate thereof, and neither shall afterwards grant
an injunction in such case. 

SEC. 17. If any person disobey or violate an injunction
after it is served on him, the circuit court to which it is returned, or any judge thereof in vacation, shall issue an attachment against him for a contempt; and unless he shall
disprove or purge the contempt, if in vacation, the judge may
commit him to jail until the sitting of the court in which the
injunction is pending, or take bail for his appearance in said
court at the next term thereof, to answer for the contempt,
and abide the order of the court, and in the mean time to
observe and obey the injunction.

SEC. 18. After the answer is filed, a motion may be made
at any time in term to dissolve the injunction; and, upon such
motion, the parties may introduce testimony to support the
petition and answer, and the court shall decide the motion
upon the weight of testimony, without being bound to take
the answer as true.

SEC. 19. If, after a motion for a dissolution of the injunction is made, either party will satisfy the court by his
own affidavit, or that of any other person for him, that any
material specified part of the bill or answer to which be objects is untrue, that he has witnesses whose testimony he believes he can procure at the next term, or other material testimony, which will disprove the same, and that he has not
been able to procure such testimony by using due diligence,
the court may continue the motion until the next term.

SEC. 20. The testimony to be heard on such motion
shall be taken as in other cases, except the afiidavits which
may have been filed with such petition or answer, which may
be read on the hearing of such motion; and depositions taken
to support or dissolve an injunction may be read on the final V
trial or other proceedings in such cause.

SEC. 21. When an application shall be made for an injunction, as herein before provided, and no notice of such
application is required by this article, and no notice is in fact
given, and the court, justices or judge, to which the application is made, shall deem it proper that the defendant, or any
of several defendants, should be heard before granting the
injunction, such court, justices or judge, may, by an order,
require cause to be shown, at a specitied time and place, why
the injunction should not be granted, and he may in the
mean time restrain the defendant, or make such other order
as the case may require.

SEC. 22. Any married woman may file her petition in
the circuit court, setting forth that her husband, from habitual
intemperance, or any other cause, is about to squander and
waste the property, money, credits and choses in action, to
which she is entitled in her own right, or any part thereof,
or is proceeding fraudulently to convert the same, or any
part thereof, to his own use, for the purpose of placing the
same beyond her reach, and depriving her of the benefit
thereof; and the court, upon the hearing of the case, may
enjoin the husband from disposing of, or otherwise interfering with, such property, moneys, credits and choses in action,
and may appoint a receiver to control and manage the same,
for the benefit of the wife; and may, also, make such other
order in the premises as they may deem just and proper; and,
upon 'the filing of such petition, an injunction may be allowed as in other cases, and such petition shall be filed in
the county where said petitioner resides, and the husband of
said petitioner shall be made a party defendant to said
petition.

SEC. 23. If the applicant for an injunction, in the
county of St. Louis, except to stay legal proceedings, shall
accompany his application with an atlidavit, that he has good
reason to believe, and does believe, that the relief he prays
for would be eminently endangered unless immediately
granted, his application shall be heard without notice and
unreasonable delay. If the injunction be granted, the defendant may, within five days after being enjoined, and upon
reasonable notice to the other party, he heard in opposition
to it by the court, judge or justice, granting it, or the court
to which it is returnable, or the judge thereof in vacation;
and, upon such hearing, the injunction may be dissolved.
Such hearing shall be governed by the same rules as a hearing upon notice in other cases; and in said county the answer may be tiled in the case at any time after granting the
injunction, and thereupon shall be had the same proceedings
provided for in section eighteen of this article, in open court,
to which the writ was returnable, if term time, but before the
judge thereof, if in vacation, upon reasonable notice to the
opposite party.

SEC. 7. Every application by a party for the continuance of a cause shall be accompanied by his aflidavit, or the

proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied, by aHidavits or
otherwise, that the opposite party could not be ready for trial
in consequence thereof, a continuance may be granted to some

SEC. 11. A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact.

SEC. 12. An issue of fact in an action for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property, must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived, or a reference ordered, as hereinafter provided.

money.

SEC. 27. Whenever, in the progress of any trial, in any civil suit, depending in any court of record, either party shall except to the opinion of the court, and shall write his exceptio, and pray the court to allow and sign the same, the person composing the court shall, if such bill be true, sign the same.

SEC. 28. Such exception may be written and filed at the time, or during the term of the court at which it is taken, and not after. All exceptions taken during the trial of a cause or issue before the same jury, shall be embraced in the
same bill of exceptions.

account that it is untrue, he shall certify thereon, under his
hand, the cause of such refusal.

judgment.

by a jury, of the amount of damages which ought to be paid
in lieu of the performance of the judgment, and may render

a judgment for the damages so assessed, and award execution
thereon.

SEC. 35. When any document, book, voucher or other

writing, called for by any interrogatory, contains any matters not pertinent to the subject matter of the action, the answer may so state, and that such part has been sealed up, or
otherwise protected from examination, and thereupon such
part shall not be inspected by the party interrogating; but
such party may apply to the court, and obtain an order to

the parties, (or, if necessary, by inspecting the part so pro‘ tected,) was improperly withheld and concealed.

manner in which, he proposes to prove his own case.

or shall not be full and clear, or if any interrogatory shall
not be answered, and the party interrogated shall refuse to
strike out or amend, or to answer a particular interrogatory,

stricken out, or such imperfect answer to be made full and
clear, or such interrogatory to be answered within such time
as may seem reasonable.

SEC. 38. When an answer shall be adjudged irrelevant
or insuiiicient, or when a party shall be ordered to answer any
interrogatory, the court may make such order respecting costs,
either in the action or otherwise, as may be deemed just.

SEC. 39. If a party shall neglect or refuse to strike out,
amend or answer, according to the provisions of this article,
the court may enter a [judgment of] nonsuit or [by] default,
as the case may require, and proceed thereon according to law.

SEC. 40. The answer may be read at the trial, by the interrogating party, as evidence, and the party interrogated
shall be entitled to require the reading of the entire answer,
if any part thereof is read ; but the court or jury trying the
issue, or the court hearing the motion, shall not be required
to give it any other or greater weight than, under all the circumstances, it may be entitled to; but if no part of such answer be read by the interrogating party, the party interrogated shall not read, nor in any manner avail himself of, his
examination, or of the fact that he has been examined.

SEC. 41. During the trial of any action, the court may
allow interrogatories to be filed and answered, with as little ‘
delay as practicable, and may suspend the trial for the purpose of having the same answered; but such interrogatories
must be accompanied by an ailidavit, stating the reasons why
they were not filed earlier; and, unless the court upon the
whole matter, shall find that due diligence has been used, the
interrogatories shall not be tiled.

SEC. 42. When the [an] order to examine a party residing out of the State shall be made, a commission may issue,
having the interrogatories annexed, and authorizing any person or oilicer named in the commission to take the signature
and oath to the answer. ,

SEC. 43. The provisions of this act shall not extend to

actions and proceedings pending when it takes eil‘ect, but they

SEC. 2. Writs of error shall issue on demand, as a matter of right, on the final decision or judgment of the county
court, from the circuit court, in term time or vacation, except
in relation to probate matters, within ninety days from such
judgment or decision.

SEC. 3. All writs of error upon any judgment or decision of any court, in any case, whether civil or criminal, shall
be brought within three years after the rendering of such judgment or decision, and not thereafter. But persons within the
age of twenty one years shall be allowed to bring their writs

of error in civil cases within three years after such disability
is removed.

SEC. 4. If a judgment shall be rendered against several
persons, and one or more of them die, a writ of error may be
brought thereon by the survivors.

SEC. 5. If there be several persons, against whom any
judgment shall have been recovered, and entitled to bring a
writ of error thereon, living at the time of bringing such T
writ, they shall all join in such writ, except where it is other i
wise provided by law; and if any are omitted, the writ shall 3

be quashed, on motion of the defendant in error, made at any
time before joinder in error, upon due proof of the facts, by
aiiidavits, unless one or more of such persons be allowed to
proceed by the Supreme Court. ’

SEC. 6. To the allegations of there being other persons
living who ought to join in such writ of error, if it be established or admitted, the party prosecuting such writ may answer, by due proof, on aflidavit, that any of such persons not
joined are either incapable of consenting to join in such writ,
by reason of insanity or imbecility of mind, or that their consent could not be obtained, by reason of their being absent
out of this State; and if the court shall be satisfied of the
truth of such answer, such party shall be allowed to prosecute such writ, without joining such person, in the same
manner as if they were joined.

SEC. 7. To such allegation, the party prosecuting the
writ may, also, answer, by due proof, on aflidavit, that application has been made to any of the persons, not named in
such writ, to join therein, and that they have refused; in such

case, the court shall stay further proceedings on such writ,
and on the motion to quash the same, until an order shall
have been duly served upon the person so refusing, as hereinafter provided. ‘

SEC. 8. The court shall thereupon cause an order to be
entered on its record, directing the persons so refusing to
join in such writ to appear in such court, within such time as
shall be prescribed therein, and there join in such writ of
error, and in the proceedings thereon, or to be forever
precluded from bringing another writ of error on the same
judgment.

SEC. 9. A copy of such order shall be served on the
parties named therein, at least ten days previous to the time
of appearance therein specified, in like manner as an original
writ of summons.

SEC. 10. Upon the application of any person named in
such order, he may be permitted to join in such writ of error,
and in the proceedings thereon, upon the payment of the
costs of the proceedings to bring him into court, including
the motion to quash the writ of error, if it shall appear that
he refused to join in such writ on application, and without
just cause; and the writ and proceedings shall be amended by
inserting the name of such person.

SEC. 11. If any person named in such order do not appear by the time therein specified, and join in such writ of

error, upon due proof of the service of such order, the de' fault of such person shall be entered, and he shall thereby
be forever precluded from bringing any writ of error on the
same judgment, and the cause shall proceed in the same manner as if such person had been named in such writ, and in
the proceedings thereon.

SEC. 12. When the name of any person out of this State,
or incapable of giving consent to the bringing of a writ of“
error, shall be omitted in such writ, and the cause shall pro 
ceed without such name, the rights of such person shall not
be impaired by the judgment on such writ, but he may bring
his writ of error in the same manner, separately, as if no
such former writ had been brought.

SEC. 13. Any person who ought to join in a writ of
error may be permited to do so, on his application, on such

terms as the court shall impose; and the writ and proceedings
shall be amended by inserting his name, and shall proceed as
in other cases. ‘ ‘

SEC. 14. No writ of error shall stay execution, unless
the Supreme Court, or some judge thereof in vacatiOn, be
satisfied, upon an inspection of a copy of the record, that
there is error therein, and shall make an order allowing such
writ of error to stay the execution; and no such order shall
be made by a judge in vacation, after the expiration of ninety
days from the rendering of the judgment or decision complained of.

SEC. 15. No order, allowing a writ of error to stay the
execution, shall be made by the Supreme Court, or by any
judge thereof in vacation, except in the following cases:
First, Where the plaintiff in error was executor or administrator in the original action, and such action was by or
against him as such; or, Second, Where the plaintiif in
error, or some responsible person for him, together with two
sufiicient sureties, to be approved by the court or judge, or
by the judge of the circuit court, in which the judgment was
rendered, shall enter into a recognizance, before such court
or judge, to the adverse party, in a penalty sufiicient to secure
