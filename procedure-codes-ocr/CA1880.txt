or his attorney ; and when the complaint is verified, or
when the State, or any officer of the State, in his official ca
pacity, is plaintiff, the answer must be verified, unless an
admission of the truth of the complaint might subject the
party to a criminal prosecution, or unless an officer of the
State, in his official capacity, is defendant. In all cases of
a verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the party
must state that the same is true of his own knowledge,
except as to the matters which are therein stated on his
information or belief, and as to those matters that he be
lieves it to be true; and where a pleading is verified, it
must be by the affidavit of a party, unless the parties
are absent from the county whete the attorney resides,
or from some cause unable to verify it, or the facts are
within the knowledge of his attorney or other person ver
ifying the same. When the pleading is verified by the
attorney, or any other person except one of the parties,
he must set forth in the affidavit the reasons why it is not
made by one of the parties. When a corporation is a
party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof.

pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the
name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the
name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect ; and

be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in
other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this Code ;
and may, also, upon such terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his legal representative from a judgment, order,
or other proceeding taken against him through his mis
take, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; pro
vided, that application therefor be made within a reasona
ble time, but in no case exceeding six months after such
judgment, order, or proceeding was taken. When from
any cause the summons in an action has not been person
ally served on the defendant, the court may allow, on
such terms as may be just, such defendant or his legal
representative, at any time within one year after the ren
dition of any judgment in such action, to answer to the
merits of the original action. When, in an action to
recover the possession o£ personal property, the person
making any affidavit did not truly state the value of the
property, and the officer taking the property, or the sure
ties on any bond or undertaking, is sued for taking the
same, the officer or sureties may in their answer set up the
true value of the property, and that the person in whose
behalf said affidavit was made was entitled to the posses
sion of the same when said affidavit was made, or that the
value in the affidavit stated was inserted by mistake, the
court shall disregard the value as stated in the affidavit,
and give judgment according to the right of possession of
said propertv at the time the affidavit was made. [In

§ 585. Judgment may be had, if the defendant fail to
answer the complaint, as follows :
1. In an action arising upon contract for the recovery of
money or damages only, if no answer has been filed with
the clerk of the court within the time specified in the sum
mons, or such further time as may have been granted, the
clerk, upon application of the plaintiff, must enter the de
fault of the defendant, and immediately thereafter enter
judgment for the amount specified in the summons, in
cluding the costs, against the defendant, or against one or
more of several defendants in the cases provided for in
section four hundred and fourteen.
2. In other actions, if no answer has been filed with the
clerk of the court within the time specified in the sum
mons, or such further time as may have been granted,
the clerk must enter the default of the defendant; and
thereafter the plaintiff may apply at the first or any sub
sequent term of the court for the relief demanded in the
complaint. If the taking of an account, or the proof of
any fact, is necessary, to enable the court to give judg
ment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may
take the account or hear the proof; or may, in its discre
tion, order a reference for that purpose. And where the
action is for the recovery of damages, in whole or in part,
the court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury;
or if, to determine the amount of damages, the examina
tion of a long account be involved, by a reference as above
provided.
3. In actions where the service of the summons was by
publication, the plaintiff, upon the expiration of the time
for answering, may, upon proof of the publication, and
that no answer has been filed, apply for judgment ; and
the court must thereupon require proof to be made of the
demand mentioned in the complaint; and if the defend

taken upon which the party relies. Within ten days after
such service the adverse party may propose amendments
thereto, and serve the same, or a copy thereof, upon the
other party. The proposed bill and amendments must,
within ten days thereafter, be presented by the party
seeking the settlement of the bill, to the judge who tried
or heard the case, upon five days' notice to the adverse
party, or be delivered to the clerk of the court for the
judge. When received by the clerk he must immediately
§ 651
deliver them to the judge; if he be in the county; if he
he absent from the county, and either party desire the
papers to be forwarded to the judge, the clerk must, upon
notice in writing of such party, immediately forward
them by mail, or other safe channel; if not thus for
warded, the clerk must deliver them to the judge imme
diately after his return to the county. When received
from the clerk, the judge must designate the time at
which he will settle the bill, and the clerk must imme
diately notify the parties of such designation. At the
time designated, the judge must settle the bill. If the
action was tried before a referee, the proposed bill, with
the amendments, if any, must be presented to such ref
eree for settlement within ten days after service of the
amendments, upon notice of five days to the adverse
party, and thereupon the referee shall settle the bill. If
no amendments are served, or if served are allowed, the
proposed bill may be presented, with the amendments, if
any,- to the judge or referee, for settlement, without
notice to the adverse party. It is the duty of the judge
or referee, in settling the bill, to strike out of it all redun
dant and useless matter, so that the exceptions may be
presented as briefly as possible. When settled, the bill
must be signed by the judge or referee, with his certificate
to the effect that the same is allowed, and shall then be
filed with the clerk. [In effect J uly 1st, 1874.]

quired to be presented to, settled, and signed by a court
or judge. A judge or judicial officer may settle and sign a
bill of exceptions after as well as before he ceases to be
such judge or judicial officer. If such judge or judicial
officer, before the bill of exceptions is settled, dies, is re
moved from office, becomes disqualified, is absent from
tlie State, or refuses to settle the bill of exceptions, or if
no mode is provided by law for the settlement of the
same, it shall be settled and certified in such manner as

§ 659. The party intending to move for a new trial
must, within ten days after the verdict of the -jury, if the
action were tried by a jury, or after notice of the decision
§ 659
of the court or referee, if the action were tried without a
jury, file with the clerk and serve upon the adverse party
a notice of his intention, designating the grounds upon
which the motion will be made, and whether the same
will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court,
or a bill of exceptions, or a statement of the case :
1. If the motion is to be made upon affidavits, the mov
ing party must, within ten days after serving the notice,
or such further time as the court in which the action is
pending, or a judge thereof, may allow, file such affidavits
with the clerk, and serve a copy upon the adverse party,
who shall have ten days to file counter affidavits, a copy
of which must be served upon the moving party.
2. If the motion is to be made upon a bill of exceptions,
and no bill has already been settled as hereinbefore pro
vided, the moving party shall have the same time after
service of the notice to prepare and obtain a settlement of
a bill of exceptions as is provided after the entry of judg
ment, or after receiving notice of such entry by sec. 650,
and the bill shall be prepared and settled in a similar
manner. If a bill of exceptions has been already settled
and filed, when the notice of motion is given, such bill
shall be used on the motion.
3. If the motion is to be made upon a statement of the
case, the moving party must, within ten days after service
of the notice, or such further time as the court in which
the action is pending, or the judge thereof, may allow,
prepare a draft of the statement, and serve the same, or
a copy thereof, upon the adverse party. If such pro
posed statement be not agreed to by the adverse party, he
must, within ten days thereafter, prepare amendments
thereto, and serve the same, or a copy thereof, upon the
moving party. If the amendments be adopted, the state
ment shall be amended accordingly, and then presented
to the judge who tried. or heard the cause, for settlement,
or be delivered to the clerk of the court for the judge. If
not adopted, the proposed statement and amendments
shall, within ten days thereafter, be presented by the
moving party to the judge, upon live days' notice to the
adverse party, or delivered to the clerk of the court for
the judge; and thereupon the same proceedings for the
settlement of the statement shall be taken by the parties,
and clerk, and judge, as are required for the settlement of
bills of exception by sec. 050. If the action was heard by
a referee, the same proceedings shall be had for the settle
ment of the statement by him as are required by that
section for the settlement of bills of exception by a ref
eree. If no amendments are served within the time des
§ 659
ignated, or, if served, are allowed, the proposed statement
and amendments, If any, may be presented to the judge
or referee, for settlement, without notice to the adverse
party. When the notice of the motion designates, as the
ground of the motion, the insufficiency of the evidence to
justify the verdict or other decision, the statement shall
specify the particulars in which such evidence is alleged
to be insufficient. When the notice designates, as the
ground of the motion, errors in law occurring at the trial,
and excepted to by the moving party, the statement shal 1
specify the particular errors upon which the party will
rely. If no such specifications be made, the statement
shall be disregarded on the hearing of the motion. It is
the duty of the judge or referee, in settling the statement,
to strike out of it all redundant and useless matter, and
to make the statement truly represent the case, notwith
standing the assent of the parties to such redundant or
useless matter, or to any inaccurate statement. When
settled, the statement shall be signed by the judge or ref
eree, with his certificate to the effect that the same is
allowed, and shall then be filed with the clerk.
4. When the motion is to be made upon the minutes of
the court, and the ground of the motion is the insuffi
ciency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other de
cision, the notice of motion must specify the particulars
in which the evidence is alleged to be insufficient; and, if
the ground of the motion be errors in law occurring at the
trial, and excepted to by the moving party, the notice
must specify the particular errors upon which the party
will rely. If the notice do not contain the specifications
here indicated, when the motion is made on the minutes
of the court, the motion must be denied. [In effect July

§ 662. The verdict of a jury may also be vacated, and
a new trial granted by the court in which the action is
pending, on its own motion, without the application of
either of the parties, when there has been such a plain
disregard by the jury of the instructions of the court, or the
evidence in the case, as to satisfy the court that the verdict
was rendered under a misapprehension of such instruc
tions, or under the influence of passion or prejudice. The
order of the court may be reviewed on appeal in the same
manner as orders made on motions for a new trial, and a
statement to be used on such appeal may be prepared in
the same manner as statements after a motion is heard
upon the minutes of the court, as provided in sec. 661.

§ 682. The writ of execution must be issued in the
name of the people, sealed with the seal of the court, and
subscribed by the clerk, and be directed to the sheriff, and
it must intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the
court, the county where the judgment roll is filed, and if
it be for money, the amount thereof, and the amount
actually due thereon, and if made payable in a specified
kind of money or currency, as provided in section six
hundred and sixty-seven, the execution must also state
the kind of money or currency in which the judgment is
payable, and must require the sheriff substantially as fol
lows:
1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor,
it must require the sheriff to safisfy the judgment, with
interest, out of the personal property of such debtor, and
if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out
of his real property; or if the judgment be a lien upon
real property, then out of the real property belonging to
him on the day when the judgment was docketed, or at
any time thereafter; or if the execution be issued to a
county other than the one in which the judgment was re
covered, on the day when the transcript of the docket
was filed in the office of the recorder of such county, stat
ing such day, or any time thereafter.
2. If it be against real or personal property in the hands
of the personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees,
tenants, or trustees, it must require the sheriff to satisfy
the judgment, with interest, out of such property.
3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it
must require the sheriff to arrest such debtor and commit
him to the jail of the county until he pay the judgment,
with interest, or be discharged according to law.
4. If it be issued on a judgment made payable in a
specified kind of money or currency, as provided in sec
tion six hundred and sixty-seven, it must also require the
sheriff to satisfy the same in the kind of money or cur
rency in which the judgment is made payable, and the
sheriff must refuse payment in any other kind of money
or currency; and in case of levy and sale of the property
§ 683
of the judgment debtor, he must refuse payment from
any purchaser at such sale in any other kind of money or
currency than that specified in the execution. The sher
iff, collecting money or currency in the manner required
by this chapter, must pay to the plaintiff or party entitled
to recover the same, the same kind of money or currency
received by him, and in case of neglect or refusal so to
do, he shall be liable on his official bond to the judgment
creditor in three times the amount of the money so col
lected.
5. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or
personal property, it must require the sheriff to deliver
the possession of the same, describing it, to the party en
titled thereto, and may, at the same time, require the
sheriff to satisfy any costs, damages, rents, or profits, re
covered by the same judgment, out of the personal prop
erty of the person against whom it was rendered, and the
value of the property for which the judgment was ren
dered to be specified therein if a delivery thereof can
not be had; and if sufficient personal property cannot
be found, then out of the real property, as provided in the
first subdivision of this section.

other act than as above designated, a certified copy of the
judgment may be served upon the party against whom

§ 694. All sales of property under execution must be
made at auction to the highest bidder, between the hours
of nine in the morning and five in the afternoon. After
sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution,
no more can be sold. Neither the officer holding the exe
cution nor his deputy can become a purchaser or be inter
ested in any purchase at such sale. When the sale is of
personal property, capable of manual delivery, it must
be within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold
in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price;
and when the sale is of real property, consisting of sev
eral known lots or parcels, they must be sold separately;
or, when a portion of such real property is claimed by a
third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such
portion must be thus sold. The judgment debtor, if pres
ent at the sale, may also direct the order in which prop
erty, real or personal , shall be sold, when such property
consists of several known lots or parcels, or of articles
which can be sold to advantage separately, and the sheriff
must follow such directions.

§ 697. The two preceding sections must not be con
strued to make the officer liable for any more than the
amount bid by the second or subsequent purchaser, and
the amount collected from the purchaser refusing to pay.
§ 698. When the purchaser of any personal property,
capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase-money,
the officer making the sale must deliver to the purchaser
the property, and, if desired, execute and deliver to him
a certificate of the sale. Such certificate conveys to the
purchaser all the right which the debtor had in such prop
erty on the day the execution or attachment was levied.
Certificate of sale—see next section.
§ 699. When the purchaser of any personal property,
not capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase-money,

veys to the purchaser all the right which the debtor had
in such property on the day the execution or attachment

§ 703. If property be so redeemed by a redemptioner,
another redemptioner may, within sixty days after the
last redemption, again redeem it from the last redemp
tioner, on paying the sum paid on such last redemption,
with four per cent, thereon in addition, and the amount
of any assessment or taxes which the last redemptioner
may have paid thereon after the redemption by him, with
interest on such amount, and in addition the amount of
any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own,
with interest; but the judgment under which the property
was sold need not be so paid as a lien. The property may
be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed,
redeemed from any previous redemptioner, within sixty
days after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid
on the last previous redemption, with four per cent,
thereon in addition, and the amount of any assessments
or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after
the redemption by him, with interest thereon, and the
amount of any liens, other than the judgment under
which the property was sold, held by the last redemp
tioner previous to his own, with interest. Written notice
of redemption must be given to the sheriff, and a dupli
cate filed with the recorder of the county; and if any
taxes or assessments are paid by the redemptioner, or if
he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which
the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like
manner be given to the sheriff, and filed with the recorder;
and if such notice be not filed, the property may be re
deemed without paying such tax, assessment, or lien. If
no redemption be made within six months after the sale,
the purchaser, or his assignee, is entitled to a conveyance;
or, if so redeemed, whenever sixty days have elapsed,
and no other redemption has been made, and notice
thereof given, and the time for redemption has expired,
the last redemptioner, or his assignee, is entitled to a
sheriff's deed; but in all cases the judgment debtor shall
have the entire period of six months from the date of the
sale to redeem the property. If the judgment debtor re
deem, he must make the same payments as are required
to effect a redemption by a redemptioner. If the debtor
redeem, the effect of the sale is terminated, and he is
restored to his estate. Upon a redemption by the debtor,
the person to whom the payment is made must execute
and deliver to him a certificate of redemption, acknowl
edged or proved before an officer authorized to take ac
knowledgments of conveyances of real property. Such
certificate must be filed and recorded in the office of the
recorder of the county in which the property is situated,
and the recorder must note the record thereof in the mar
gin of the record of the certificate of sale. [In effect July

§ 706. Until the expiration of the time allowed for re
demption, the court may restrain the commission of waste
on the property, by order granted with or without notice,
on the application of the purchaser or the judgment cred
itor. But it is not waste for the person in possession of

redemption, and a redemptioner, from the time of his re
demption until another redemption, is entitled to receive,
from the tenant in possession, the rents of the property
sold, or the value ofthe use and occupation thereof. But
when any rents or profits have been received by the judg
ment creditor or purchaser, or his or their assigns, from
the property thus sold preceding such redemption, the
amounts of such rents and profits shall be a credit upon
the redemption money to be paid ; and if the redemptioner
or judgment debtor, before the expiration of the time al
lowed for such redemption, demands in writing of such
purchaser or creditor, or his assigns, a written and veri
fied statement of the amounts of such rents and profits '
thus received, the period for redemption is extended five
days after such sworn statement is given by such pur
chaser or his assigns to such redemptioner or debtor.
If such purchaser or his assigns shall, for a period of
one month from and after such demand, fail or refuse
to give such statement, such redemptioner or debtor may
bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction, to
compel an accounting and disclosure of such rents and
profits, and until fifteen days from and after the final de
termination of such action, the right of redemption is ex
tended to such redemptioner or debtor.

ment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from
the judgment creditor. If the purchaser of property at
sheriff's sale, or his successor in interest, fail to recover
possession, in consequence of irregularity in the proceed
ings concerning the sale, or because the property sold was
not subject to execution and sale, the court having juris
diction thereof must, after notice and on motion of such
party in interest, or his attorney, revive the original judg
ment in the name of the petitioner, for the amount paid
by such purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from

ment is against several, and is upon an obligation of one
of them, as security for another, and the surety pays

of the county where the judgment roll is filed, is returned
unsatisfied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at

apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such
judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to
appear, at a specified time and place, before such judge,
or a referee appointed by him, to answer concerning the
same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for
the application of the property of the judgment debtor
toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided
upon the return of an execution. Instead of the order
requiring ' the attendance of the judgment debtor, the
judge may, upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his
agent, or attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger
of the debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the
debtor and bring him before such judge. Upon being
brought before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into
an undertaking, with sufficient surety, that he will attend
from time to time before the judge or referee, as may be
directed during the pendency or proceedings and until
the final termination thereof, and will not in the mean
time dispose of any portion of his property not exempt
from execution. In default of entering into such under

§ 720. If it appear that a person or corporation, alleged
to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted
to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him,
or denies the debt, the court or judge may authorize, by
an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor to in
stitute an action against such person or corporation for
the recovery of sucn interest or debt; and the court or
judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition
of such interest or debt, until an action can be commenced

§ 726. There can be but one action for the recovery of
any debt, or the enforcement of any right secured by
mortgage upon real estate or personal property, which
action must be in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. In such action, the court may, by its judgment,
direct a sale of the incumbered property (or so much
thereof as may be necessary), and the application of the
proceeds of the sale to the payment of the costs of the
court and the expenses of the sale, and the amount due
to the plaintiff; and if it appear from the sheriff's return
that the proceeds are insufficient, and a balance still re
mains due, judgment can then be docketed for such bal
ance against the defendant or defendants personally lia
ble for the debt, and it becomes a lien on the real estate
of such judgment debtor, as in other cases on which exe
cution may be issued. No person holding a conveyance
from or under the mortgagor of the property mortgaged,
or having a lien thereon, which conveyance or lien does
not appear of record in the proper office at the time of
the commencement of the action, need be made a party
to such action; and the judgment therein rendered, and
the proceedings therein had, are as conclusive against the
Earty holding such unrecorded conveyance or lien as if
e had been made a party to the action.

§ 728. If the debt for which the mortgage, lien, or in

more becomes due, for principal or interest, the court
may, on motion, order more to be sold. But if the prop
erty cannot be sold in portions, without injury to the par
ties, the whole may be ordered to be sold in the first in
stance, and the entire debt and costs paid, there being a
rebate of interest where such rebate is proper.

Partition,
Final judgment—sec.
sec. 763n. 766, and note.
§ 760. Whenever from any cause it is, in the opinion
of the court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to
make a complete partition, in the first instance, among all
the parties in interest, the court may first ascertain and
determine the shares or interest respectively held by the
original cotenants, and thereupon adjudge and cause a
partition to be made, as if such original cotenants were
the parties and sole parties in interest, and the only
parties to the action, and thereafter may proceed in like
manner to adjudge and make partition separately of each
share or portion so ascertained and allotted, as between
those claiming under the original tenant to whom the
same shall have been so set apart, or may allow them to
remain tenants in common thereof, as they may desire.
§ 761. If it appears to the court, by the certificate of
the county recorder or county clerk, or by the sworn or
verified statement of any person who may have examined
or searched the records, that there are outstanding liens
or incumbrances of record upon such real property, or
any part or portion thereof, which existed and were of
record at the time of the commencement of the action,
and the persons holding such liens are not made parties
to the action, the court must either order such persons to

whether or not such liens or incumbrances have been paid,
or if not paid, what amount remains due thereon, and
their order among the liens or incumbrances .severally
held by such persons and the parties to the action, and
whether the amount remaining due thereon has been
secured in any manner, and if secured, the nature and
extent of the security.
§ 762. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served,
a reasonable timo previous to the day for appearance be
fore the referee appointed as provided in the last section,
on each person having outstanding liens of record, who U
not a party to the action, to appear before the referee at
a specified time and place, to make proof, by his own affi
davit or otherwise, of the amount due or to become due
contingently or absolutely thereon. In case such person
be absent, or his residence be unknown, service may be
made by publication, or notice to his agents, under the
direction of the court, in such manner as may be proper.
Tho report of the referee thereon must be made to the
court, and must be confirmed, modified, or set aside, and
a new reference ordered, as the justice of the case may
require.
§ 763. If it be alleged in the complaint and established
by evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without such
allegation in the complaint to the satisfaction of the court,
that the property or any part of it is so situated that par
tition cannot be mado without great prejudice to the
owners, the court may order a sale thereof; otherwise,
upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a
partition according to the respective rights of the parties
as ascertained by the court, and appoint three ref
erees therefor, and must designate the portion to remain
undivided for the owners whose interests remain un
known, or are not ascertained; provided, that when the
site of an incorporate city or town is included within the
exterior boundaries of tho property to be partitioned,
then, on said fact being established by evidence, tho fol
lowing proceedings shall be had: The court shall there
upon direct tho referees to survey and appraise the entire
property to bo partitioned by actual lots and subdivisions
then existing in tho actual possession of the several ten
ants in common, exclusive of the value of improvements
thereon, first setting apart necessary portions of the prop-
erty for ways, roads, and streets, as in section seven
hundred and sixty-four of this Code provided, and to re
port such survey and separate appraisement on each lot
and subdivision to tho court. The court may confirm,
change, modify, or set aside the report in whole or in part,
and if necessary appoint new referees. When, after the
final confirmation of the report of such survey and ap
praisement, it shall appear by evidence to the satisfaction
of the court that an equitable partition of the whole prop
erty is impracticable, and a sale of the site of such city
or town, or any portion thereof, will be for the best inter
ests of the owners of tlie whole property, it shall order a
sale thereof; provided, that within sixty ctays thereafter
any tenant in common, or tenants in common, having im
provements erected on any town or city lot or subdivis
ion included in such order of sale, shall have the prior
right to purchase the same at such appraised valuation,
and may pay into court the amount so appraised as the
value thereof, and upon such payment the title shall vest
in such purchaser or purchasers, and the court shall cause
to be executed by said referees a deed for such lot or sub
division in fee and in severalty to such purchaser or pur
chasers; such further proceedings shall then bo had as to
the remainder of the property, and the money so paid to
the court, as by this chapter provided. If, during the
pendency of the action, any of the parties die, or become
insane or otherwise incompetent, the proceedings shall
not for that cause be delayed or suspended, but tho attorney
wli o has appeared for such party may continue to repre
sent sucli interest; and in case any such party has not
appeared by an attorney, the court shall appoint an
attorney to represent the interest which was held by such
party, until his heirs or legal representatives, or success
ors in interest, shall have appeared in the action; and an
attorney so appointed shall be allowed by the court a
reasonable compensation for his services, which may be
taxed as costs against the share or interest represented
by such attorney, and may bo adjudged a lien there
on, in the discretion of the court. [In effect April 12th,
1880.]

§ 764. In making partition, the referees must divide the
property, and allot the several portions thereof to the
respective parties, quality and quantity relatively consid
ered, according to the respective rights of the parties as
determined by the court, pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, designating the several portions by proper
landmarks, and may employ a surveyor with the neces
sary assistants to aid them. Before making partition or
sale, the referees may, whenever it will be for the advan
tage of those interested, set apart a portion of the prop
erty for a way, road, or street, and the portion so set
apart shall not be assigned to any of the parties or sold,
but shall remain an open and public way, road, or street,
unless the referees shall set the same apart as a private
way for the use of the parties interested, or some of them,
their heirs and assigns, in which case it shall remain such
private way. Whenever the referees have laid out on any
tract of land roads sufficient in the judgment of said ref
erees to accommodate the public and private wants, they
shall report that fact to the court, and upon the confirma
tion of their report all other roads on said tract shall cease
to be public highways. Whenever it shall appear, in an
action for partition of lands, that one or more of the ten
ants in common, being the owner of an undivided interest
in the tract of land sought to be partitioned, has sold to
another person a specific tract by metes and bounds out of
the common land, and executed to the purchaser a deed of
conveyance, purporting to convey the whole title to such
specific tract to the purchaser in fee and in severalty, the
land described in such deed shall be allotted and set apart
in partition to such purchaser, his heirs or assigns, or in
such other manner as shall make such deed effectual as a
conveyance of the whole title to such segregated parcel,
if such tract or tracts of land can be so allotted or set
apart without material injury of the rights and interests
of the other cotenants who may not have joined in such
conveyance; provided, that in all cases the court shall
direct the referees, in making partition of land, to allot
the share of each of the parties owning an interest in the
whole or in any part of the premises sought to be parti
tioned, and to locate the share of each cotenant, so as to
embrace as far as practicable the improvements made by
such cotenant upon the property, and the value of the im
provements made by the tenants in common must be ex
cluded from the valuation in making allotments, and the
land must he valued without regard to such improve
ment, in case the same can be done without material in
jury to the rights and interests of the other tenants
in common owning such land. [Approved April 3rd,
1876.]

§ 766. The court may confirm, change, modify or set
aside the report, and if necessary, appoint new referees.
Upon the report being confirmed, judgment must be ren

terest in the property divided, or any part thereof, as
owners in fee or as tenants for life or for years, or as en
titled to the reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of
such property, or any part thereof, after the determination
of a particular estate therein, and who by any contingency .

for partition by publication;
3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or
persons, or either of them.

of any party before final judgment or decree; but such
judgment or decree is as conclusive against the heirs, legal
representatives, or assigns of such decedent, as if it had
been entered before his death.

the different parties to the action, equitably.
Referee's fees—sec. 1028.
§ 769. When a lien is on an undivided interest or estate
of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made,
shall thenceforth be a charge only on the share assigned
to such party; but such share must be first charged with
its Just proportion of the costs of the partition, in prefer
ence to such lien.
§ 770. When a part of the property only is ordered
to i)e sold, if there be an estate for life or years, in an un
divided share of the whole property, such estate may be
set off in any part of the property not ordered to be sold.
§ 771. The proceeds of the sale of incumbered prop
erty must be applied under the direction of the court, as
follows :
1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the
action;
2. To pay the costs of the reference ;
3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens in
their order of priority, by payment of the sums due and
to become due ; the amount due to be verified by affidavit
at the time of payment;
4. The residue among the owners of the property sold,
according to their respective shares therein.
§ 772. Whenever any party to an action, who holds a
lien upon the property, or any part thereof, has other
securities for the payment of the amount of such lien, the
court may, in its discretion, order such securities to be ex
hausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or
may order a just deduction to be made from the amount
of the lien on the property, on account thereof.
§ 773. The proceeds of sale and the securities taken by
the referees, or any part thereof, must be distributed by
them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the court
so directs. But in case no direction be given, all of such
proceeds and securities must be paid into court, or depos
ited therein, or as directed by the court.

parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by
pleadings, as in an original action.
§ 775. All sales of.real property, made by referees un
der this chapter, must be made at publio auction to the
highest bidder, upon notice published in the manner re
quired for the sale of real property on execution. The

contained, to be invested for the benefit of unknown own
ers, infants, or parties out of the State.
§ 777. The referees may take separate mortgages and
other securities for the whole, or convenient portions of
the purchase-money, of such parts of the property as are
directed by the court to be sold on credit, for the shares of

years, whose estate has been sold, is entitled to receive
such sum as may be deemed a reasonable satisfaction for
such estate, and which the person so entitled may consent
to accept instead thereof, by an instrument in writing,
filed with the clerk of the court. Upon the filing of such
consent, the clerk must enter the same in the minutes of
the court.
§ 779. If such consent be not given, filed, and entered,
as provided in the last section, at or before a judgment of
sale is rendered, the court must ascertain and determine
what proportion of the proceeds of the sale, after deduct

him, as the case may require.
§ 780. If the persons entitled to such estate for life or
years be unknown, the court must provide for the protec
tion of their rights, in the same manner, as far as may be,

in such manner as to protect the rights and interests of
the parties.
§ 782. In all cases of sales of property the terms must
be made known at the time ; and if the premises consist
of distinct farms or lots, they must be sold separately.
§ 783. Neither of the referees, nor any person for the
benefit of either of them, can be interested in any pur
chase ; nor can a guardian of an infant party be interested
in the purchase of any real property, being the subject of
the action, except for the benefit of the infant. All sales
contrary to the provisions of this section are void.
§ 784. After completing a sale of the property, or any
part thereof ordered to be sold, the referees must report

§ 785. If the sale be confirmed by the court, an order
must be entered, directing the referees to execute convey
ances and take securities pursuant to such sale, which
they are hereby authorized to do. Such order may also

taken, or when an investment of any such proceeds is
made, it must be done, except as herein otherwise pro
vided, in the name of the clerk of the county where the
papers are filed, and his successors in office, who must

judgment, on the appeal from which the proceedings were
not stayed ; and for relief in such cases the appellant may
have his action against the respondent, enforcing the judg
ment for the proceeds of the sale of the property, after
deducting therefrom the expenses of the sale. When it
appears to the appellate court that the appeal was made
for delay, it may add to the costs such damages as may be
just.

§ 978. An appeal from a Justice's or Police Court is
not effectual for any purpose, unless an undertaking be
filed with two or more sureties in the sum of one hundred
dollars for the payment of the costs on the appeal;) or, if
a stay of proceedings be claimed, in a sum equal trrtwice
the amount of the judgment, including costs, when the
judgment is for the payment of money ; or twice the value
of property, including costs, when the judgment is for the
recovery of specific personal property, and must be con
ditioned, when the action is for the recovery of money,
that the appellant will pay the amount of the judgment
appealed from, and all costs, if the appeal be withdrawn
or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment and all
costs that may be recovered against him in the action in
the Superior Court. When the action is for the recovery
of or to enforce or foreclose a lien on specific personal
property, the undertaking must be conditioned that the
appellant will pay the judgment and costs appealed from,
and obey the order of the court made therein, if the ap
peal he withdrawn or dismissed, or any judgment and
costs that may be recovered against him in said action
in the Superior Court, and will obey any order made by
the court therein. When the judgment appealed from
directs the delivery of possession of real property, the
execution of the same cannot be stayed unless a written
undertaking be executed on the part of the appellant,
with two or more sureties, to the effect that during the
possession of such property by the*appellant, he will not
commit, or suffer to be committed, any waste thereon,
and that if the appeal be dismissed or withdrawn, or
the judgment affirmed, or judgment be recovered against
him. in the action in the Superior Court, he will pay the
value of the use and occupation of the property from the
time of the appeal until the delivery of possession there
of; or that he will pay any judgment and costs that may
be recovered against him in said action in the Superior
Court, not exceeding a sum to be fixed by the justice of
the court from which the appeal is taken, and which sum
must he specified in the undertaking. A deposit of the
amount of the judgment, including all costs appealed
from, or of the value of the property, including all costs
in actions for the recovery of specific personal property,
with the justice or judge, is equivalent to the filing of the
undertaking, and in such cases, the justice or judge must
transmit the money to the clerk of the Superior Court, to
he by him paid out on the order of the court. The adverse
party may except to the sufficiency of the sureties within
five days after the filing of the undertaking, and unless
they or other sureties justify before the justice or judge
within five days thereafter, upon notice to the adverse
party, to the amounts stated in their affidavits, the ap
peal must be regarded as if no such undertaking had been
given. [In effect March 26th, 1880.]

§ 979. If an execution be issued on the filing of the
undertaking staying proceedings, the justice or judge
must, by order, direct the officer to stay all proceedings
on the same. Such officer must, upon payment of his
fees for services rendered on the execution, thereupon re
linquish all property levied upon, and deliver the same to
the judgment debtor, together with all moneys' collected
from sales or otherwise. If his fees be not paid, the offi
cer may retain so much of the property or proceeds thereof
Cons Civ. Pkoc—30.
as may be necessary to pay the same. [In effect March
26th, 1880.]
Stay of proceedings—sec. 946n.
§ 980. Upon an appeal heard upon a statement of the
case, the Superior Court may review all orders affecting
the judgment appealed from, and may set aside, or con
firm, or modify any or all of the proceedings subsequent
to and dependent upon such judgment, and may, if neces
sary or proper, order a new trial. When the action is
tried anew on appeal, the trial must be conducted in all
respects as other trials in the Superior Court. The pro
visions of this Code as to changing the place of trial, and
all the provisions as to trials in the Superior Court, are
applicable to trials on appeal in the Superior Court. Tor
a failure to prosecute an appeal, or unnecessary delay in
bringing it to a hearing, the Superior Court, after notice,
may order the appeal to be dismissed, with costs; and if
it appear to such court that the appeal was made solely
for delay, it may add to the costs such damages as may
be just, not exceeding twenty-five per cent, of the judg
ment appealed from. Judgments rendered in the Su
perior Court on appeal shall have the same force and
effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as judg
ments in actions commenced in the Superior Court. [In

§ 1161. A tenant of real property, for a term less than

1. When he continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, of the property, or any part thereof, after the
expiration of the term for which it is let to him, without
the permission of his landlord, or the successor in estate oj
his landlord, if any there be ; but in case of a tenancy at
will, it must first be terminated by notice, as prescribed
in the Civil Code.
2. Where he continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, without permission of his landlord, or the suc
cessor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, after default
in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement
under which the property is held, and three days' notice,
in writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount
which is due, or possession of the property, shall have
been served upon him, and if there be a subtenant in

actual occupation of the premises, also upon such sub
tenant. Such notice may be served at any time within
one year after the rent becomes due. In all cases of ten
ancy upon agricultural lands, where the tenant has held
over and retained possession for more than sixty days
after the expiration of his term without any demand of
possession or notice to quit by the landlord, or the succes
sor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, he shall be
deemed to be holding hy permission of the landlord, or
the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, and
shall he entitled to hold under the terms of the lease for
another full year, and shall not be guilty of an unlawful
detainer during said year, and such holding over for the
period aforesaid shall be taken and construed as a consent
on the part of a tenant to hold for another year.
3. When he continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, after a neglect or failure to perform other con
ditions or covenants of the lease or agreement under
which the property is held, including any covenant not to
assign or sublet, than the one for the payment of rent, and
three days' notice, in writing, requiring the performance
of such conditions or covenants, or the possession of the
property, shall have been served upon him, and if there
be a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also
upon such subtenant. Within three days after the ser
vice of the notice, the tenant, or any subtenant in actual
occupation of the premises, or any mortgagee of the term,
or other person interested in its continuance, may perform
the conditions or covenants of the lease, or pay the stip
ulated rent, as the case may be, and thereby save the
lease from forfeiture;* [provided, if the covenants and con
ditions of lease, violated by the lessee, cannot afterward
be performed, then no notice, as last prescribed herein;
need be given to said lessee or his subtenant demanding
the performance of the violated covenant or conditions^
the lease.] A tenant may take proceedings, similar to
those prescribed in this chapter, to obtain possession of
the premises let to an under-tenant, in case of his unlaw
ful detention of the premises underlet to him.

to property not actually taken but injuriously affected,
in all cases -where such damages are allowed as provided
In section twelve hundred and forty-eight. If an order
be made letting the plaintiff into possession, as provided
in section twelve hundred and fifty-four, the compensa
tion and damages awarded shall draw lawful interest
from the date of such order. No improvements put upon

sation or damages.
Compensation—on condemation: generally, 
Damages—when not special, 50 Cal. 90.
§ 1250. If the title attempted to be acquired is found

§ 1251. The plaintiff must, within thirty days after

at the time of or before payment, elect to build the fences
and cattle guards, and if he so elect, shall execute to the
defendant a bond, with sureties to be approved by the
court in double the assessed cost of the same, to build
such fences and cattle guards within eighteen months
from the time the railroad is built on the land taken, and
if such bond be given, need not pay the cost of such
fences and cattle guards. In an action on such bond, the
plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney's fees.
§ 1252. Payment may be made to the defendants en
titled thereto, or the money may be deposited in court
for the defendants, and be distributed to those entitled
thereto. If the money be not so paid or deposited, the
defendants may have execution as in civil cases, and if
the money cannot be made on execution, the court, upon
a showing to that effect, must set aside and annul the en
tire proceedings, and restore possession of the property to
the defendant, if possession has been taken by the plaint
iff.
Payment made—to whom, 6 Cal. 639.
§ 1253. When payments have been made, and the
bond given, if the plaintiff elects to give one, as required
by the last two sections, the court must make a final
order of condemnation, which must describe the property
condemned, and the purposes of such condemnation. A
copy of the order must be filed in the office of the recorder
of the county, and thereupon the property described
therein shall vest in the plaintiff for the purposes therein
specified.
§ 1254. At any time after trial and judgment entered,
or pending an appeal from the judgment to the Supreme
Court, whenever the plaintiff shall have paid into court,
for the defendant, the full amount of the judgment, and
such further sum as may be required by the court as a
fund to pay any further damages and costs that may be
recovered in said proceeding, as well as all damages that
may be sustained by the defendant, if, for any cause, the
property shall not be finally taken for public use, the Supe
rior Court in which the proceeding was tried may, upon
notice of not less than ten days, authorize the plaintiff, if
already in possession, to continue therein, and, if not,
then to take possession of and use the property during
the pendency of and until the final conclusion of the liti
gation, and may, if necessary, stay all actions and pro
ceedings against the plaintiff on account thereof. The
defendant, who is entitled to the money paid into court
for him upon any judgment, shall be entitled to demand
and receive the same at any time thereafter upon obtain
ing an order therefor from the court. It shall be the duty
of the court, or a judge thereof, upon application being
made by such defendant, to order and direct that the
money so paid into court for him be delivered to him upon
his filing a satisfaction of the judgment, or upon his filing
a receipt therefor, and an abandonment of all defenses to
the action or proceeding, except as to the amount of dam
ages that he may be entitled to in the event that a new
trial shall be granted. A payment to a defendant, as
aforesaid, shall be held to be an abandonment by such
defendant of all defenses interposed by him, except
ing his claim for greater compensation. In ascer
taining the amount to he paid into court, the court
shall take care that the same be sufficient and adequate.
The payment of the money in court, as hereinbefore
provided for, shall not discharge the plaintiff from lia
bility to keep the said fund full and without diminution;
but such money shall he and remain, as to all accidents,
defalcations, or other contingencies, (as between the
parties to the proceedings) at the risk of the plaintiff, and
shall so remain until the amount of the compensation or
damages is finally settled by judicial determination, and
until the court awards the money, or such part thereof as
shall be determined upon, to the defendant, and until he
is authorized or required by rule of court to take it. If,
for any reason, the money shall at any time be lost, or
otherwise abstracted, or withdrawn, through no fault of
the defendant, the court shall require the plaintiff to
make and keep the sum good at all times until the litiga
tion is finally brought to an end, and until paid over or
made payable to the defendant by order of court, as above
provided ; and until such time or times the county clerk
shall be deemed to be the custodian of the money, and
shall be liable to the plaintiff upon his official bond for
the same, or any part thereof, in case it be for any reason
lost or otherwise abstracted or withdrawn. The court
may order the money to be deposited in the State treas
ury, and in such case it shall be the duty of the State
treasurer to receive all such moneys, duly receipt for and
safely keep the same in a special fund, to be entered on
his books as a condemnation fund for such purpose, and
for such duty he shall be liable to the plaintiff upon his
official bond. The State treasurer shall pay out such
money so deposited in such manner and at such times as
the court or a judge thereof "may, by order or decree,
direct. In all cases where a new trial has been granted
upon the application of the defendant, and he has failed
upon such trial to obtain greater compensation than was
allowed him upon the first trial, the costs of such new trial
shall be taxed against him. [In effect April 26th, 1880.]

demned, (if not already in possession, as provided in sec
tion twelve hundred and fifty-four) and devote the same

trial or appeal shall, after such payment and filing of
sucli bond, as aforesaid, in any manner retard the con
templated improvement. Any money which shall have

money assessed, and the remainder, if any there be, shall

(any two of whom may act) who are entitled to receive a
reasonable compensation for their services, not to exceed
rive dollars per day, to be allowed by the court or judge.
The appraisers must, with the inventory, file a verified
account of their services and disbursements. If any part
of the estate is in any other county than that in which
letters issued, appraisers thereof may be appointed, either
by the court or judge having jurisdiction1 of the estate, or
by the court or judge of such other county, on request of
the court or judge having jurisdiction. [In effect April

Appraisers—duty as to homestead, sees. 1476, 1486: appointed at

§ 1445. Before proceeding to the execution of their
duty, the appraisers, before any officer authorized to ad
minister oaths, must take and subscribe an oath, to be
attached to the inventory, that they will truly, honestly,
and impartially appraise the property exhibited to them,
according to the best of their knowledge and ability.
They must then proceed to estimate and appraise the
property ; each article must be set down separately, with
the value thereof in dollars and cents, in figures, opposite
to the articles, respectively ; the inventory must contain
all the estate of the decedent, real and personal, a state
ment of all debts, partnerships, and other interests, bonds,
mortgages, notes, and other securities for the payment of
money belonging to the decedent, specifying the name of
the debtor in each security, the date, the sum originally
payable, the indorsements thereon, (if any) with their
dates, and the sum which, in the judgment of the ap
praiser, may be collected on each debt, interest, or secu
rity ; the inventory must show, so far as the same can be
ascertained by the executor or the administrator, what
portion of the property is community property, and what
portion is the separate property of the decedent.
§ 1446. The inventory must also contain an account of
all moneys belonging to the decedent which have come to
the hands of the executor or administrator; and if none,
the fact must be so stated in the inventory. If the whole
estate consists of money, there need not bo an appraise
ment, but an inventory must be made and returned as in
other cases.
§ 1447. The naming of a person as executor does not
thereby discharge him from any just claim which the
testator has against him, but the Claim must be included
in the inventory, and the executor is liable for the same,

the county jail, there to remain until the order is com
plied with, or he is discharged according to law; and all
such interrogatories and answers must be in writing,
signed by the party examined, and filed in the court.
The order for such disclosure made upon such examina
tion shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the ex
ecutor or administrator to such property in any action
brought for the recovery thereof; and any judgment re
covered therein must be for double the value of the prop
erty as assessed by the court or jury, or for return of the

§ 1495. Any judge of a Superior Court may present
a claim against the estate of a decedent for allowance
to the executor or administrator thereof, and if the ex
ecutor or administrator allows the claim, he must in
writing designate some other judge of tho Superi'or Court
of the same or an adjoining county, who, upon the pre
sentation of such claim to him, is vested with power to
allow or reject it, and the judge presenting such claim, in
case of its rejection by the executor or administrator, or
by such judge as shall have acted upon it, has the same
right to suo in a proper court for its recovery as other per
sons have when their claims against an estate are rejected.
[In effect April 10th, 1880.]
§ 1496. When a claim, accompanied by the affidavit
required in this chapter, is presented to the executor or
administrator, he must indorse thereon his allowance or
rejection, with the day and date thereof. If he allow the
claim, it must be presented to a judge of the Superior
Court for his approval, who must in the same manner in-
dorse upon it his allowance or rejection. If the executor
or administrator, or the judge, refuse or neglect to in
dorse such allowance or rejection for ten days after the
claim has been presented to him, such refusal or neglect
may, at the option of the claimant, be deemed equivalent
to a rejection on the tenth day; and if the presentation

due course of administration, the amount ascertained to
be due. A certified transcript of the original docket of
the judgment must be filed among the papers of the
estate in court. No execution must issue upon such
judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property
of the estate, or give to the judgment creditor any pri
ority of payment. [In effect April 16th, 1880.]

§ 1507. If the executor or administrator doubts the
correctness of any claim presented to him, he may enter
into an agreement, in writing,- with the claimant, to refer
the matter in controversy to some disinterested person,
to be approved by the Superior Court, or a judge thereof.
Upon tiling the agreement and approval of such court or
judge, in the office of the clerk of the court for the county
in which the letters testamentary or of administration
were granted, the clerk must enter a minute of the order
referring the matter in controversy to the person so
selected; or, if the parties consent, a reference may be had
in the court; and the report of the referee, if confirmed,
establishes or rejects the claim the same as if it had been
allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator and
judge. [In effect July 16th, 1880.]
§ 1508. The referee must hear and determine the mat
ter, and make his report thereon to the court in which his
appointment is entered. The same proceedings shall be
had in all respects, and the referee shall have the same
powers, be entitled to the same compensation, and subject
to the same control, as in other cases of reference. The
court may remove the referee, appoint another in his
place, set aside or confirm his report, and adjudge costs,

§ 1509. "When a judgment is recovered, with costs,

Allowed him in his administration accounts—6 Cal. 669.
§ 1510. If the executor or administrator is a creditor
of the decedent, his claim duly authenticated by affidavit
must be presented for allowance or rejection to a judge of
the Superior Court, and its allowance by the nudge is
sufficient evidence of its correctness, and must be paid as
other claims in due course of administration. If, how
ever, the judge reject the claim, action thereon may be
had against the estate by the claimant, and summons
must be served upon
attorney, at the expense of the estate, to defend the
action. If the claimant recover no judgment, he must
pay all costs, including defendant's reasonable attorney's
fees, to be fixed by the court. [In effect April 16th,
1880.]

§ 1512. At the same time at which he is required to
return his inventory, the executor or administrator must
also return a statement of all claims against the estate
which have been presented to him, if so required by the
court, or a judge thereof, and from time to time thereafter
he must present a statement of claims subsequently pre
sented to him, if so required by the court, or a judge there

petition must be filed and an order thereupon made,
directing all persons interested in the estate to appear
before the court, at a time and place specified, not less

§ 1542. If it appears necessary to sell a part of the
real estate, and that by a sale thereof the residue of the
estate, real or personal, or some specific part thereof,
would be greatly injured or diminished in value, or sub
jected to expense, or rendered unprofitable, or that after
any such sale the residue would be so small in quantity
or value, or would be of such a character with reference
to its future disposition among the heirs or devisees, as
clearly to render it for the best interest of all concerned
that the same should be sold, the court may authorize the
sale of the whole estate, or of any part thereof necessary
and for the best interest of all concerned.
Sale of whole of real estate —order for, when not collaterally

§ 1543. If -the court is satisfied, after a full hearing
upon the petition and an examination of the proofs ana
allegations of the parties interested, that a sale of the
whole or some portion of the real estate is necessary, for
any of the causes mentioned in thii article, or if such sale
be assented to by all the persons interested, an order
must be made to sell the whole, or so much and such
parts of the real estate described in the petition, as the
court shall judge necessary or beneficial.

installments, and in such kind of money, with interest, as
the court may direct. The land may be sold in one parcel
or in subdivisions, as the executor or administrator shall
judge most beneficial to the estate, unless the court other
wise specially directs. If it appears that any part of
such real estate has been devised, and not charged in
such devise with the payment of debts or legacies, the
court must order the remainder to be sold before that so
devised. Every such sale must be ordered to be made
at public auction, unless, in the opinion of the court, it
would benefit the estate to sell the whole or some part of
such real estate at private sale. The court may, if the
same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such
real estate, or any part thereof, to be sold at either pub
lic or private sale, as the executor or administrator shall
judge to be most beneficial for the estate. If the executor
or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale under
the order, and as directed therein, he may be compelled
to sell, by order of the court, made on motion, afteT due
notice, by any party interested.

apply for an order of sale when it is necessary, any per
son may make application therefor, in the same manner
as the executor or administrator, and notice thereof must
be given to the executor or administrator, before the heariug. The petition of such applicant must contain as
many of the matters set forth in section fifteen hundred
and thirty-seven as he can ascertain, and the decree of
sale must fix the period of time within which the execu
tor or administrator must make the sale.
§ 1546. Eepealed July 1st, 1874.
§ 1547. "When a sale is ordered, and is to be made at
public auction, notice of the time and place of sale must

in which the land is situated, and published in a newspa
per, if there be one printed in the same county, but if
none, then in such paper as the court may direct, for
three weeks successively next before the sale; the lands
and tenements to be sold must be described with com

1557, 1558.
§ 1549. When a sale of real estate is ordered to be
made at private sale, notice of the same must be posted
up in three of the most public places in the county in
which the land is situated, and published in a newspaper,
if there be one printed in the same county ; if none, then
in such paper as the court or a judge thereof may direct,
for two weeks successively next before the day on or after
which the sale is to bo made, in which the lands and tene
ments to be sold must be described with common cer
tainty. The notice must state a day on or after which the
sale 'will be made, and a place where offers or bids 'will be
received. The day last referred to must be at least fifteen
days from the first publication of notice; and the sale
must not be made before that day, but must be made
within six months thereafter. The bids or offers must be
in writing, and may be left at the place designated in the
notice, or delivered to the executor or administrator per
sonally, or may be riled in the office of the clerk of the
court to which the return of sale must be made, at any
time after the first publication of the notice and before the
making of the sale. If it be shown that it will be for the
best interest of the estate, the court or judge may, by an
order, shorten the time of notice, which shall not, how
ever, be less than one week, and may provide that the
sale may be made on or after a day less than fifteen, but
not less than eight days from the first publication of the
notice, in which case the notice of sale, and the sale, may
be made to correspond with such order. [In effect April
16th, 1880.]
§ 1550. No sale of real estate at private sale shall be
confirmed by the court, unless the sum offered is at least
ninety per cent, of the appraised value thereof, nor unless
such real estate has been appraised within one year of the
time of such sale. If it has not been so appraised, or if the
court is satisfied that the appraisement is too high or too
low, appraisers must be appointed, and they must make
an appraisement thereof in the same manner as in case of
an original appraisement of an estate. This may be done
at any time before the sale or the confirmation thereof.
§ 1551. The executor or administrator must, when the
sale is made upon a credit, take the notes of the pur
chaser for the purchase-money, with a mortgage on the
property to secure their payment.
Credit sale—interest, 9 Cal. 181.
Payment by offset—on mortgage claim, 39 Cal. 306.
§ 1552. The executor or administrator, after making
any sale of real estate, must make a return of his pro
ceedings to the court, which must be filed in the office of
the clerk, at any time subsequent to the sale. A hearing
upon the return of the proceedings may be asked for in
the return or by petition subsequently, and thereupon the
court or judge must fix the day for the hearing, of which
notice of at least ten days must be given by the clerk, by
notices posted in three, public places in the county, or by
publication in a newspaper, or both, as the court or judge
Code Crv. Paoc—43.
shall direct, and must briefly indicate the land sold, the
sum for which it was sold, and must refer to the return
for further particulars. Upon the hearing, the court must
examine the return and witnesses in relation to the same,
and if the proceedings were unfair, or the sum bid dispro
portionate to the value, and if it appear that a sum ex
ceeding such bid at least ten per cent., exclusive of the
expenses of a new sale, may be obtained, the court may
vacate the sale and direct another to be had, of which
notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted
as if no previous sale had taken place. If an offer of ten
per cent, more in amount than that named in the return
be made to the court in writing, by a responsible person,
it is in the discretion of the court to accept such offer and
confirm the sale to such person, or to order a new sale. [ In

produce witnesses in support of his objections.
Objection by person interested—sureties on additional bond alleged.

§ 1554. If it appears to the court that the sale was le

not disproportionate to the value of the property sold,
and that a greater sum, as above specified, cannot be ob
tained, or if the increased bid mentioned in section
fifteen hundred and fifty-two be made and accepted by
the court, the court must make an order confirming the
sale, and directing conveyances to be executed. The
sale, from that time, is confirmed and valid, and a certi
fied copy of the order confirming it and directing con
veyances to be executed, must be recorded in the office
of the recorder of the county in which the land sold is situ
ated. If, after the confirmation, the purchaser neglects
or refuses to comply with the terms of sale, the court may,
ou motion of the executor or administrator, and after
notice to the purchaser, order a resale to be made of the
property. If the amount realized on such resale does
not cover the bid and the expenses of the previous sale,
such purchaser is liable for the deficiency to the estate.

§ 1555. Conveyances must thereupon be executed to
the purchaser by the executor or administrator, and they
must refer to the orders of the court authorizing and con
firming the sale of the property of the estate, and directing
conveyances thereof to be executed, and to the record of
the order of confirmation in the office of the county re
corder, either by the date of such recording, or by the date,
volume, and page of the record, and such reference shall
have the same effect as if the orders were at large in
serted in the conveyance. Conveyances so made convey
all the right, title, interest, and estate of the decedent in
the premises, at the time of his death ; if prior to the sale,
by operation of law or otherwise, the estate has acquired
any right, title, or interest in the premises, other than or
in addition to that of the decedent at the time of his
death, such right, title, or interest, also passes by such
conveyances. [In effect April 16th, 1880.]

three months.
§ 1558. In case of a postponement, notice thereof must
be given, by a public declaration, at the time and place
first appointed for the sale, and if the postponement be
for more than one day, further notice must be given, by
posting notices in three or more public places in the
county where the land is situated, or publishing tbe same,
or both, as the time and circumstances will admit.

§ 1563. The estate,*real and personal, given by will to
legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of
administration, and family expenses, in proportion to the
value or amount of the several devises or legacies; but
specific devises or legacies are exempt from such liability,
it it appears to the court necessary to carry into effect the
intention of the testator, and there is other sufficient es
tate.

§ 1564. When an estate given by will has been sold
for the payment of debts or expenses, all the devisees and
legatees must oontribute according to their respective in
terests to the devisee or legatee whose devise or legacy
has been taken therefor, and the court, when distribution
is made, must, by decree for that purpose, settle the
amount of the several liabilities, and decree the amount
each person shall contribute, and reserve the same from
their distributive shares, respectively, for the purpose of
paying such contribution. [In effect April 16th, 1880.]
§ 1565. If a decedent, at the time of his death, was
possessed of a contract for the purchase of lands, his in
terest in such land and under such contracts may be sold
on the application of his executor or administrator, in the
same manner as if he had died seized of such land ; and
the same proceedings may be had for that purpose as are
grescribed in this chapter for the sale of lands of which
e died seized, except as hereinafter provided.
§ 1566. The sale must be made subject to all payments
that may thereafter become due on such contracts, and if
there are any such, the sale must not be confirmed by the
court until the purchasers execute a bond to the execu
tor or administrator for the benefit and indemnity of him
self and of the persons entitled to the interest of the de
cedent in the lands so contracted for, in double the whole
amount of payments thereafter to become due on such
contract, with such sureties as the court or judge shall
approve. [In effect April 16th, 1880.]
§ 1567. The bond must be conditioned that the pur
chaser will make all payments for sucli land that become
due after the date of the sale, and will fully indemnify the
executor or administrator and the persons so entitled,
against all demands, costs, charges, and expenses, by
reason of any covenant or agreement contained in such
contract.
§ 1568. Upon the confirmation of the sale, the executor
or administrator must execute to the purchaser an assign
ment of the contract, which vests in the purchaser, his
heirs and assigns, all the right, title, and interest of the
estate, or of the persons entitled to the interest of the de
cedent, in the lands sold at the time of the sale; and the
purchaser has the same rights and remedies against the
vendor of such land as the decedent would have had if he
were living.
§ 1569. When any sale is made by an executor or ad
ministrator, pursuant to provisions of this chapter, of lands
subject to any mortgage or other lien, which is a valid
claim against the estate of the decedent, and has been
presented and allowed, the purchase-money must be ap
plied, after paying the necessary expenses of the sale,
first, to the payment and satisfaction of the mortgage or
lien, and the residue, if any, in due course of administra
tion. The application of the purchase-money to the sat
isfaction of the mortgage or lien must be made without
delay ; and the land is subject to such mortgage or lieu
until the purchase-money has been actually so applied.
No claim against any estate, which has been presented
and allowed, is affected by the Statute of Limitations,
pending the proceedings for the settlement of the estate.
The purchase-money, or so much thereof as may be suffi
cient to pay such mortgage or lien, with interest, and anylawful costs and charges thereon, may be paid into the
court, to be received by the clerk thereof, whereupon the
mortgage or lien upon the land must cease, and the pur
chase-money must be paid over by the clerk of the court
without delay, in payment of the expenses of the sale,
and in satisfaction of the debt to secure which the mort
gage or other lien was taken, and the surplus, if any, at
once returned to the executor or administrator, unless
for good cause shown, after notice to the executor or ad
ministrator, the court otherwise directs. [In effect April

thereof, an amount sufficient to pay such expenses. [In

is necessary for the settlement of the estate to require
the payment of any part of the money thereby secured,
the executor or administrator must petition the court for
an order requiring the payment, and have a citation issued
and served on the party bound, requiring him to appear
and show cause why the order should not be made. At

ecutor or administrator, if any, among the persons who
by law are entitled thereto; and if the decedent has left
a surviving child, and the issue of other children, and
any of them, before the close of the administration, have
died while under age and not having been married, no
administration on such deceased child's estate is neces
sary, but all the estate which such deceased child was
entitled to by inheritance must, without administration,
be distributed to the other heirs-at-law. A statement of
any receipts and disbursements of the executor or admin
istrator, since the rendition of his final accounts, must
be reported and filed at the time of making such distribu
tion, and a settlement thereof, together with an estimate

§ 1675. AVhen the estate, real or personal, assigned by
the decree of distribution to two or more heirs, devisees,
or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respect
ive shares are not separated and distinguished, partition
or distribution may be made by three disinterested per
sons, to be appointed commissioners for that purpose by
the court, who must be duly sworn to the faithful dis
charge of their duties, a certified copy of the order of
their appointment, and of the order or decree assigning
and distributing the estate, must be issued to them as
their warrant, and their oath must be indorsed thereon.
Upon consent of the parties, or when the court deems it
proper and just, it is sufficient to appoint one commis
sioner only, who has the same authority and is governed
by the same rules as if three were appointed, [in effect
July 16th, 1880.]
Attorney appointed by the court—sec. 1718.
§ 1676. Such partition may be ordered and had in the
Superior Court on the petition of any person interested.
But before commissioners are appointed, or partition
ordered by the court as directed in this chapter, notice
thereof must be given to all persons interested who reside
in this State, or to their guardians, and to the agents,
attorneys, or guardians, if any in this State, of such as
reside out of this State, either personally or by public
notice, as the court may direct. The petition may be filed,
attorneys, guardians, and agents appointed, and notice
given at any time before the order or decree of distribu
tion, but tbe commissioners must not be appointed until
the order or decree is made distributing the estate. [In
effect July 16th, 1880.]
§ 1677. If the real estate is in different counties, the
court may, if deemed proper, appoint commissioners for
all, or different commissioners for each county. ,The
estate in each county must be divided separately among
the heirs, devisees, or legatees, as if there was no other
estate to be divided; but the commissioners first appointed
must, unless otherwise directed by the court, make divi
sion of such real estate wherever situated within this
State. [In effect July 10th, 1880.]
§ 1678. Partition or distribution of the real estate may
be made as provided in this chapter, although some of
the original heirs, legatees, or devisees, may have con
veyed their shares to other persons, and such shares must
be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same
manner as they otherwise would bave been to such heirs,
legatees, or devisees.
Person holding the same—extends to assignees of alienees, 18 Cal.
99; direct distribution to assignee of deceased heir, My. P. Rep. 232.
§ 1679. When both distribution and partition are made,
the several shares in the real and personal estate must be
set out to each individual in proportion to his right, by
metes and bounds, or description, so that the same can be
easily distinguished, unless two or more of the parties in
terested consent to have their shares set out so as to be
held by them in common and undivided.
§ 1680. When the real estate cannot be divided with
out prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the court
may assign the whole to one or more of the parties en
titled to share therein, who will accept it, always pre
ferring the males to the females, and among children,
preferring the elder to the younger. The parties accept
ing the whole must pay to the other parties interested
their just proportion of the true value thereof, or secure
the same to their satisfaction, or in case of the minority
of such party, then to the satisfaction of his guardian;
and the true value of the estate must be ascertained and
reported by the commissioners. When the commissioners
appointed to make partition are of the opinion that the
real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or incon
venience to the owners, they must so report to the court,
and recommend that the whole be assigned as herein pro
vided, and must find and report the true value of such
real estate. On filing the report of the commissioners,
and on making or securing the payment as before pro
vided, the court, if it appears just and proper, must con
firm the report, and thereupon the assignment is com
plete, and the title to the whole of such real estate vests
in the person to whom the same is so assigned. [In effect
July 16th, 1880.]
§ 1681. When any tract of land or tenement is of
greater value than any one's share in the estate to be
divided, and cannot be divided without injury to the same,
it may be set off by the commissioners appointed to make
partition to any oj the parties who will accept it, giving
preference as prescribed in the preceding section. The
party accepting must pay or secure to the others such
sums as the commissioners shall award to make the par
tition equal, and the commissioners must make their
award accordingly; but such partition must not be es
tablished by the court until the sums awarded are paid
to the parties entitled to the same, or secured to their sat
isfaction.
§ 1682. "When it appears to the court, from the com
missioners' report, that it cannot otherwise be fairly di
vided and should be sold, the court may order the sale of
the whole or any part of the estate, real or personal, by
the executor or administrator, or by a commissioner ap
pointed for that purpose, and the proceeds distributed.
The sale must be conducted, reported, and confirmed, in
the same manner and under the samo requirements pro
vided in article four, chapter seven, of this title.
§ 1683. Before any partition is made or any estate di
vided, as provided in this chapter, notice must be given
to all persons-interested in the partition, their guardians,
agents, or attorneys, by the commissioners, of the time and
place when and where, they shall proceed to make parti
tion. The commissioners may take testimony, order sur
veys, and take such other steps as may be necessary to
enable them to form a judgment upon the matters before
them.
§ 1684. The commissioners must report their proceed
ings, and the partition agreed upon by them, to the court,
in writing, and the court may, for sufficient reasons, set
aside the report and commit the same to the same com
missioners, ' or appoint others; and when such report is
finally confirmed, a certified copy of the judgment, or de
cree of partition made thereon, attested by the clerk under
the seat of the court, must he recorded in the office of the
recorder of the county where the lands lie. [In effect Julv
16th, 1880.]
§ 1685. "When the court makes a judgment or decree
assigning the residue of any estate to one or more per
sons entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint
commissioners to make partition or distribution thereof,
unless the parties to whom the assignment is decreed, or
some of them, request that such partition be made. [In
effect July lGth, 1880.]
§ 1686. All questions as to advancements made, or al
leged to have been made, by the decedent to his heirs,
may be heard and determined by the court, and must be
specified in the decree assigning and distributing the es
tate; and the final judgment or decree of the court, or in
case of appeal, of the Supreme Court, is binding on all
parties interested in the estate. [In effect July 16tn, 1880.]
§ 1691. "When any estate is assigned or distributed by
a judgment or decree of the court, as provided in this
chapter, to any person residing out of, and having no
agent in this State, and it is necessary that some person
should be authorized to take possession -and charge of the
same for the benefit of such absent person, the court may
appoint an agent for that purpose, and authorize him to
take charge of such estate, as well as to act for such ab
sent person in the distribution.
§ 1692. The agent must execute a bond to the State of
California, to be approved by the court, or a judge thereof,
conditioned that lie shall faithfully manage and account
for the estate. The court appointing such agent may al
low a reasonable sum out of the profits of the estate for
his services and expenses. [In effect July 16th, 1880.]
§ 1693. When personal property remains in the hands
of the agent unclaimed for a year, and it appears to the
court that it is for the benefit of those interested, it shall
be sold under the order of the court, and the proceeds,
after deducting the expenses of the sale allowed by the
court, must be paid into the State treasury. When the
payment is made, the agent must take from the treasury
duplicate receipts, one of which he must file in the office
of the controller, and the other in the court. [In effect
July 16th, 1880.]
Paid into the State treasury—But not distributed among the other
heirs, 6 Cal. 418.
§ 1694. The agent must render the court appointing

him, what portion thereof is still on hand, whafesold, and
for what;
2. The income derived therefrom ;
3. The taxes and assessments imposed thereon, for
what, and whether paid or unpaid;
4. Expenses incurred in the care, protection, and man
agement thereof, and whether paid or unpaid. When
filed, the court may examine witnesses and take proofs
in regard to the account; and if satisfied from such ac
counts and proofs that it will be for the benefit and ad
vantage of the persons interested therein, the court may,
by order, direct a sale to be made of the whole or such
parts of the real or personal propefty as shall appear to
be proper, and the purchase-money to be deposited in the
State treasury. [In effect July 16th, 1880.]
§ 1695. The agent is liable on his bond for the care
and preservation of the estate while in his hands, and for
the payment of the proceeds of the sale as required in
the preceding sections, and may be sued thereon by any
person interested.

money paid into the treasury, the court making the dis
tribution must inquire into such claim, and being first sat
isfied of his right thereto, must grant him a certificate to
that effect, under its seal; and upon the presentation of
the certificate to him, the controller must draw his war
rant on the treasurer for the amount. [In effect July 16th,

of its contents, is secondary evidence of the instrument

§ 1831. Direct evidence is that which proves the fact
in dispute directly, without an inference or presumption,
and which in itself, if true, conclusively establishes that
fact. For example: if the fact in dispute be au agree
ment, the evidence of a witness who was present and
witnessed the making of it, is direct.
§ 1832. Indirect evidence is that which tends to estab
lish the fact in dispute by proving another, and which,
though true, does not of itself conclusively establish that
fact, but which affords an inference or presumption of its
existence. For example : a witness proves an admission
of the party to the fact in dispute. This proves a fact,

§ 1833. Prima facie evidence is that which suffices for
the proof of a particular fact, until contradicted and over
come by other evidence. For example: the certificate of
a recording officer is primafacie evidence of a record, but
it may afterward be rejected upon proof that there is no
such record. [In effect July 1st, 1874.]

fl834. Partial evidence is that which goes to establish
etached fact, in a series tending to the fact in dispute.
It may be received, subject to be rejected as incompetent,
uuless connected with the fact in dispute by proof of
other facts. For example: on an issue of title to real
property, evidence of the continued possession of a re
mote occupant is partial, for it is of a detached fact,
which may or may not be afterward connected with the
fact in dispute.
Connected with the fact in dispute—sec. 1868.
§ 1835. That evidence is deemed satisfactory which
ordinarily produces moral certainty or conviction in an
unprejudiced mind. Such evidence alone will justify a

§ 1915. The effect of the judgment of any other tribu
nal of a foreign country having jurisdiction to prono.unce
the judgment, is as follows:
1. In case of a judgment against a specific thing, the
judgment is conclusive upon the title to the thing;
2. In case of a judgment against a person, the judgment
is presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties
and their successors in interest -by a subsequent title, and
' can only be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdic
tion, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear
mistake of law or fact.
§ 1916. Any judicial record may be impeached by ev
idence of a want of jurisdiction in the court or judicial
officer, of collusion between the parties, or of fraud in the
party offering the record, in respect to the proceedings.

§ 1960. An inference must be founded—
1. On a fact legally proved ; and,
2. On such a deduction from that fact as is warranted
by a consideration of the usual propensities or passions of
men, the particular propensities or passions of the person
whose act is in question, the course of business, or the
course of nature.

conclusive) may be controverted by other evidence, direct

ing another.
2. The truth of the facts recited, from the recital in a
written instrument between the parties thereto, or their
successors in interest by a subsequent title ; but this rule
does not apply to the recital of a consideration.
3. Whenever a party has, by his own declaration, act,
or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to
believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such be
lief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such
declaration, act, or omission, be permitted to falsify it.
4. A tenant is not permitted to deny the title of his land
lord at the time of the commencement of the relation.
5. The issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband,
who is not impotent, is indisputably presumed to be
legitimate.

this Code to be conclusive; but such judgment or order
must be alleged in the pleadings, if there be' an opportu
nity to do so ; if there be no such opportunity, the judg
ment or order may be used as evidence.
7. Any other presumption which, by statute, is ex
pressly made conclusive.

or other things under his control, which he is bound by
law to produce in evidence.
§ 1986. The subpoena is issued as follows :
1. To require attendance before a court, or at the trial
of an issue therein, it is issued under the seal of the court
before which the attendance is required, or in which the
issue is pending;
2. To require attendance out of the court, before a judge,
justice, or other officer authorized to administer oaths or
take testimony in any matter under the laws of this
State, it is issued by the judge, justice, or any other officer

try, or of the United States, or of any other State in the

the laws of the United States to take testimony, it may
be issued by any judge or justice oi the peace in places
within their respective jurisdiction; with like power to
enforce attendance, and, upon certificate of contumacy to
said court, to punish contempt of their process, as such
judge or justice could exercise if the subpcana directed
the attendance of the witness before their courts in a
matter pending therein.
§ 1987. The service of a subpoena is made by showing
the original and delivering a' copy, or a ticket containing
its substance, to the witness personally, giving or offering
to him at the same time, if demanded by him, the fees to
which he is entitled for travel to and from the place
designated, and one day's attendance there. The serv
ice must be made so as to allow the witness a reasonable
time for preparation and travel to the place of attend
ance. Such service may be made by any person.
§ 1988. If a witness is concealed in a building or vessel,
so as to prevent the service of a subpcana upon him, any

upon proof by affidavit of the concealment, and of the
materiality of the witness, make an order that the sheriff
of the county servo the subpcana; and the sheriff must
serve it accordingly, and for that purpose may break into
the building or vessel where the witness is concealed.
§ 1989. A witness is not obliged to attend as a witness
before any court, judge, justice, or any other officer, out
of the county in which he resides, unless the distance be
less than thirty miles froru his place of residence to the
place of trial.
§ 1990. A person present in court, or before a judicial
officer, may be required to testify in the same manner as
if he were in attendance upon a subpoena issued by such
court or officer.
§ 1991. Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be
Rworn, or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affi
davit or deposition when required, may be punished as a
contempt by the court or officer issuing the subpoena or
requiring the witness to be sworn ; and if the witness be
a party, his complaint or answer maybe stricken out.

§ 1992. A witness disobeying a subpoena also forfeits
to the party aggrieved the sum of one hundred dollars,
and all damages which he may sustain by the failure of
the witness to attend, which forfeiture and damages may
be recovered in a civil action.
§ 1993. In case of failure of a witness to attend, the
court or officer issuing the subpoena, upon proof of the serv
ice thereof, and of the failure of the witness, may issue a
warrant to the sheriff of the county to arrest the witness
and bring him before the court or officer where his at
tendance was required.
§ 1994. Every warrant of commitment, issued by a
court or officer pursuant to this chapter, must specify
therein, particularly, the cause of the commitment, and

witness may be, and must be executed by him in the
same manner as process issued by the Superior Court.

moval and production before a court or officer, for the
purpose of being orally examined, may be made as fol
lows:

ceeding is pending, unless it be a Justice's Court;
2. By a justice of the Supreme Court, or a judge of the
Superior Court of the county where the action or proceed
ing is pending, if pending before a Justice's Court, or
before a judge or other person out of court. [In effect
April 16th, 1880.]
§ 1996. Such order can only be made on the motion
of a party, upon affidavit showing the nature of the ac
tion or proceeding, the testimony expected from the wit
ness, and its materiality.

Subpama—sec. 19S5 ei seq.
§ 2037. If a commission has not been issued, and it

the peace, by affidavit satisfactory to him:
1. That the testimony of the witness is material to
either party;
2. That a commission to take the testimony of such wit
ness has not been issued ;
3. That, according to the law of the State where the

Cal. 622 : effect of disobeying order for, 20 Cal. 436.
§ 2044. The court must exercise a reasonable control
over the mode of interrogation, so as to make it as rapid,
as distinct, as little annoying to the witness, and as effect
ive for the extraction of the truth as may be; but subject
to this rule—the parties may put such pertinent and legal
questions as they see fit. The court, however, may stop
the production of further evidence upon any particular
point when the evidence upon it is already so full as to
preclude reasonable doubt.
Control of court—over examination, 47 Cal. 194: answer of witness,
sees. 2065, 2066: stopping further testimony, 39 Cal. 38.
§ 2045. The examination of a witness by the party
producing him is denominated the direct examination;
the examination of the same witness, upon the same
matter, by the adverse party, the cross-examination.
The direct examination must be completed before the
cross-examination begins, unless the court otherwise
direct.
§ 2046. A question which suggests to the witness the
answer which the examining party desires, is denominated
a leading or suggestive question. On a direct examina
tion, leading questions are not allowed, except in the
sound discretion of the court, under special circumstances
making it appear that the interests of justice require it.
§ 2047. A witness is allowed to refresh his memory
respecting a fact, by anything written by himself or under
his direction at the time when the fact occurred or imme
diately thereafter, or at any other time when the fact was
fresh in his memory and he knew that the same was cor
rectly stated in the writing. But in such case, the writ
ing must be produced and may be seen by the adverse
party, who may, if he choose, cross-examine the witness
upon it, and may read it to the jury. So, also, a witness
may testify from such a writing, though he retain no
recollection of the particular facts, but such evidence
must be received with caution.
Refreshing memory—4 Cal. 260 ; 43 CaL 166.
Inspection of writing—shown to witness, sec. 2054.
§ 2048. The opposite party may cross-examine the
witness as to any facts stated in his direct examination or
connected therewith, and in so doing may put leading
questions, but if he examine him as to other matters,
such examination is to be subject to the same rules as a
direct examination.

§ 2061. The jury, subject to the control of the court,
in the cases specified in this Code, are the judges of the
effect or value of evidence addressed to them, except
when it is declared to be conclusive. They are, however,
to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions—
1. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence
is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discretion,
and in subordination to the rules of evidence.
2. That they are not bound to decide in conformity with
the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do not
produce conviction in their minds, against a less number
or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying
their minds.
3. That a witness false in one part of his testimony is to
be distrusted in others.
4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be
viewed with distrust, and the evidence of the oral admis
sions of a party with caution.
5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue must
be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory the
decision must be made according to the preponderance of
evidence; that in criminal cases guilt must be established
beyond reasonable doubt.
b'. That evidence is to be estimated not only by its own
intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence which
it is in the power of one side to produce, and of the other
to contradict; and, therefore,
7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is
offered, when it appears that stronger and more satisfac
tory was within the power of the party, the evidence
offered should be viewed with distrust.

establish a claim against himself; but he need not give an
answer which will have a tendency to subject him to pun
ishment for a felony ; nor need he give an answer which
will have a direct tendency to degrade his character—un
less it be to the very fact in issue, or to a fact from which
the fact in issue would be presumed. But a witness must
answer as to the fact of his previous conviction for felony.

§ 2069. An officer is not liable to the party for making
the arrest in ignorance of the facts creating the exonera

party, if such party claim the exemption and make an
affidavit stating—
1. That he has been served with a subpoena to attend as
a witness before a court, officer, or other person, specify
ing the same, the place of attendance, and the action or
proceeding in which the subpoena was issued ; and,
2. That he has not thus been served by his own procure
ment, with the intention of avoiding an arrest;
3. That he is at the time going to the place of attend
ance, or returning therefrom, or remaining there in obe
dience to the subpoena.
The affidavit may be taken by the officer, and exonerates
him from liability for discharging the witness when ar
rested.
§ 2070. The court or officer issuing the subpoena, and
the court or officer before whom the attendance is re
quired, may discharge the witness from an arrest made
in violation of section two thousand and sixty-seven.

the person to whom the payment or delivery is made,
and may demand a proper signature to such receipt as a
condition of the payment or delivery.
§ 2076. The person to whom a tender is made, must, at
the time, specify any objection he may have to the money,
instrument, or property, or he must be deemed to have
waived it ; and if the objection be to the amount of money,
the terms of the instrument, or the amount or kind of
property, he must specify the amount, terms, or kind
which he requires, or be precluded from objecting after
ward?
§ 2077. The following are the rules for constructing the
descriptive part of a conveyance of real property, when
the construction is doubtful and there are no other suffi
cient circumstances to determine it :
1. Where there are certain definite and ascertained par
ticulars in the description, the addition of others which
are indefinite, unknown, or false, does not frustrate the
conveyance, but it is to be construed by the first men
tioned particulars ;
2. When permanent and visible or ascertained bounda
ries or monuments are inconsistent with the measure
ment, either of lines, angles, or surfaces, the
or monuments are paramount;
3. Between different measurements which are incon
sistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to
that of surfaces, and that of lines paramount to both;
4. When a road, or stream of water not navigable, is the
boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the
road or the thread of* the stream are included in the con
veyance, except where the road or thread of the stream
is held under another title ;
5. When tide-water is the boundary, the rights of the
grantor to ordinary high-water-mark are included in the
conveyance. When a navigable lake, where there is no
tide, is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to lowwater-mark are included in the conveyance;
G. When the description refers to a map, and that ref
erence is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls
them if it appear that the parties acted with reference to
the map; otherwise, the map is subordinate to other defi
nite and ascertained particulars. [In effect July 1st, 1871.]

to prove their respective debts ; and the assignee shall be
chosen by the creditors of the copartnership, and shall also
keep separate accounts of the joint stock or property of
the copartnership, and of the separate estate of each

partners who do not join in the petition shall be ordered
to show cause why they should not be adjudged to be in
solvent, in the same manner as other debtors are required
to show cause upon a creditor's petition, as in this act
provided.
