garnishment. .

oath-

indebted to the defendant; if so, how and to what amount. 
2. Whether he had in his possession, or under his control,
any property, debts, or effects belonging to the defendant,
at the time of serving the notice, or bas at the time of an­
swering, or has had at any time between the date of ser­
vice and the time of answering; and, if so, the kind and
amount. 
§ 3088. Whether there are, to his knowledge or belief, any and
what property, debts, and effects in the possession or under

ment. 
§ 3091. If the garnishee fails to appear or answer, a condi-
tional judgment may be entered against him for the plain- 
tiff's debt, upon which a notice shall issue to the garnishee,
returnable at such time as the court or Justice may require,
to show cause why judgment final should not be rendered
against him; and on failure of the garnishee to appear
and show cause, the conditional judgment shall be made 
final, and execution awarded for the plaintiff's entire debt,
and costs. 
§ 3092. If, upon the examination of the garnishee, it appears

effects, as the case may be, or so much thereof as will be
sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's debt and costs, and all
charges incident to the proceedings.

any property, debts, or effects of the defendant are probably 
in the hands of other persons, the court or Justice shall, on
the application of the plaintiff, issue notice to such persons
to come forward and answer as garnishees, and the same pro-
ceedings may be had as in other cases. 
§ 3094. So soon as the property is declared to be the pro-
perty of the defendant, under the provisions of the two 
preceding sections, it shall be delivered up to the officer
serving the garnishment, on demand, and on failure to de-
liver the same, and return made on the execution of that 
fact, jud~ent shall be entered immediately against the gar­
nishee, for the debt and cost. 
§ 3095. When the property consists of an interest in land,
if the garnishment proceedings are before a Justice, he 
shall return the papers to the Circuit Court of the county for
condemnation, as in other cases of the levy of a Justice's exe­
cution on land. 
§ 3096. The garnishee against whom judgment is rendered
by a Justice of the Peace, for money, shall be entitled to stay
the execution as in other cases. 
§ 3097. The words "property, debts and effects," include

judgments before a Justice of the Peace, also money, stocks,
and any interest in an incorporated company. 
§ 3098. Execution of the garnishment judgment may be
stayed until choses in action fall due, and the court may 
order them to be collected, if necessary, or sold for what
they will bring, as may be deemed just and proper. 
§ 3099. The garnishee against whom judgment has been
rendered, is entitled to a certificate from the clerk or Justice, 
stating the date and amount of the garnishment judgment,
in whose favor and in what case rendered, which certificate
shall have all the force and effect of a receipt against the
original debt, and entitle the garnishee to a credit to the
amount thereof on the original judgment, or on the execution,
if already issued, to be entered by the Justice or officer. 
§ 3100. The provisions of this Code in regard to garnish­
ment on attachments, and attachments, regulate also pro­ 
ceedings under this article whenever applicable. 
§ 3101. The officer having an execution shall not summon a
garnishee under the provisions of this Code,. if he can find 
property of the debtor in his county sufficient to satisfy such
execution. 
§ 3102. The garnishee shall have the pay and be entitled to
the privilege of a witness, and shall recover costs against the
plaintiff if the garnishment is not successfully prosecuted,
unless the court or Justice should be of opinion that the gar­ 
nishee has been guilty of fraud or combination with the
judgment debtor, and order otherwise. 
§ 3103. Where the sum in controversy is less than fifty 
dollars, the answer of the garnishee is not conclusive, but

therein. Upon the trial, the answer of the garnishee is testi­
mony.

as herein provided. 
§ 3111. The writ of error coram nobis may be had within
one year from the rendition of the judgment, bi petition
presented to the Judge at chambers or in open court, who
may order it to operate as a supersedeas or not. 
§ 3112. Before such order shall operate as a supersedeas, the
party applying shall giYc bond, with good security, in double 
the amount of the Judgment, conditioned to abide by and
perform the judgment or decree. of the court. 
§ 3113. Notice of the suing out of the writ shall be served on

take, or fraud, without fault on his part. 
§ 3117. Thus, infancy at the rendition of the judgment, not
appearing on the record sought to be corrected, or a real
defence to an action by mot.ion, of which the party aggrieved
had no notice, and so of like cases, are good grounds for
relief under this writ. 
§ 3118. If the matter is not tried at the first term after the
writ is sued out, the court may discharge the superaedeas, 
upon the motion of the adverse party, and his denial on oath
of the facts alleged in the petition, upon taking a refunding

thereof, may recover the same by an action of ejectment. 
§ 3230. The action is commenced by summons and declara-
tion, in which the name of the real claimant is used as plain- 
tiff, and the pro:per name of the defendant is inserted.
§ 3231. The action is brought against the actual occupant, 
if any, and if no such occupant, then against any person
claiming an interest therein, or exercising acts of ownership 
at the commencement of the suit.
§ 3232. When the suit is against a tenant by a party claim- 
ing adversely to the title of his landlord, the landlord mav
appear and be made a defendant with, or in the place of, the
tenant. 
§ 3233. A copy of the declaration shall be left with the
defendant at the time the summons is served upon him. 
§ 3234. It is sufficient for the plaintiff to allege in his decla-
ration, that he was possessed of the premises sued for at the
time specified, which should be after his title accrued, and
being so possessed thereof, the defendant afterwards, on
a day stated, entered thereon, and unlawfully withholds the
same, to the plaintiff's damage, naming the sum. 
§ 3235. The plaintiff's declaration shall specify the quantity
of his estate, and the extent of his interest, according to the 
truth, and describe the premises with convenient certainty, 
by metes and bounds, or other appropriate description.
§ 3236. The declaration may contain several counts, and 
several parties may be named as plaintiffs jointly in one
count, and separately in others, but not without the consent 
of the party in person, or by a duly authorized agent,
unless he be tenant in common with the party commencing
the suit. And if the name of a person be used as a plaintiff
contrary to this provision, the suit shall be dismissed at the
cost of the plaintiff, on motion of the defendant, and proof
of want of authority. · 
§ 3237. The pleading-sin this action may be amended under
the provisions of this Code, so as to conform to the truth
and attain the ends of justice. · 
§ 3238. If the defendant conceive the plaintiff's declaration
to be fata11y defective upon its face, he may demur as in
other cases. 
§ 3239. The defendant may plead that he is not guilty of
unlawfully withholding the premises claimed by the plaintiff,
and upon such plea may avail himself of all legal defence. 
§ 3240. Such plea admits that the defendant is in possession
of the premises sued for, unless he states distinctly upon the 
record the extent of his possession.
§ 3241. If the defendant fails to appear and defend within 
the first three days of the return term, judgment by default
may be taken, and such judgment executed as in · other
cases. 
§ 3242. Upon the trial, the plaintiff need not prove an actual
entry on or possession of the premises demanded, or receipt 
of any profits thereof, nor any lease, entry or ouster, except
as herein provided; but it is sufficient for him to show a
ri_e;ht to the possession of the premises at the commencement
ot the suit. · 
§ 3243. If the action be brought by one or more tenants in
common, coparceners, or jomt owners, against their co­
tenants, the plaintiff shall prove actual ouster, or some other
act by the defendant amounting to a denial of the plaintiff's
right as co-tenant. 
§ 3244. When therearemoredefendantsthan one, thejurymay
find the defendants jointly or severally guilty of detaining all
or any distinct parcels of the premises, and plaintiff may have 
judgment against all or any defendant, according to the facts
of the case. 
§ 3245. The plaintiff may recover any specific part or share
of the premises embraced in the declaration, though less than 
he claims.
§ 3246. The verdict may be for the plaintiffs, or such of them 
as appear to ave rig t to t e possession o t e premises, or
any part thereof, and against such of the defendants as were 
in possession thereof, or claimed title thereto at the com­
mencement of the action . 
§  3247. The verdict may specify the extent and quality of
the plaintiff's estate, and the premises to which he is entitled, 
with reasonable certainty, by metes and bounds, or other suf-
ficient description, according to the facts as proved. 
§ 3248. And if the right of the plaintiff expire after the
commencement of the suit and before trial, the verdict shall 
be -according to the facts, and judgment shall be entered
for damages for the withholding of the premises by the
defendant; and as to the premises, the judgment shall be
that the defendant go thence without day. 
§ 3249. A general verdict in favor of the plaintiff, without
such specifications, entitles the plaintiff to the quantity of 
interest, or estate, and the premises, as set. forth and de­
scribed in the declaration. 
§ 3250. The judgment for the plaintiff is that he recover the
possession of the premises according to the verdict, or, ·if by 
default or on demurrer, according to the description in the
declaration. 
§ 3251. The judgment is executed by a writ of possession
issued to the sheriff, and directing him to put the plaintiff in
possession of the premises. 
§ 3252. Any such judgment is conclusive upon the party
against whom it is recovered, not under disability at the time 
of the recovery, and all persons claiming under him by title
accruing after the commencement of the action. 
§ 3253. If the v.erson against whom the recovery is had is
under the disability of infancy, coverture, or unsoundness of 
mind at the time of the recovery, the judgment is no bar to
an action commenced within three years after the removal
of such disability. 
§ 3254. Nothing in the last section shall be held to affect the
general provisions of this Code, touching the limitation of
actions, or to extend the time within which suits must be in-
stituted by those provisions. 
§ 3255. The death of either party does not abate the action,
but it may be revived in favor of the heirs or devisees of the 
plaintiff; and against the heirs and terre-tenants of the de-
fendant. . 
§ 3256. If the heirs are non-resident, the court may order
publication to be made for them, as in the case of other non­
resident defendants; and if they fail to appear and defend,
judgment by default may be taken, subject to the rules and
regulations of this Code, touching judgments against non­
resident defendants. 
§ 3257. If any of the defendant's heirs are infants, either
resident or non-resident, without regular guardian in this
State, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for such
infants after suit has been revived against them by service of
process, or publication as aforesaid. 
§ 3258. Should such non-resident heirs appear, the court
may, at any time before the trial, upon satisfactory ground
shown, change the guardians, and appoint others to defend in
behalf of such defendants. 
§ 3259. Nothing in this chapter contained deprives the plain-
tiff of his right to an action for mesne profits, a.ft.er verdict
and judgment in his favor, nor the defendant of the right to
file a bill in equity for the value of his improvements, but
those rights are suhject to the general provisions of this Code
regulating actions. 
§ 3260. A tenant in possession in good faith, under a. lease
or license from another, is not liable beyond the rent in
arrear at the time of suit brought for the recovery of the land,
and that which may afterwards accrue during the continuance
of his possession. 
§ 3261. Persons holding possession in good faith under color
of title, are entitled to have the value of their permanent 
improvements set off against the rents and profits which the
plaintiff may recover.

§ 3276. The court may allow any amendment of the plead-
ings or proceedings, so as to make a party thereto any person

mises, and give judgment that partition be made between
such of them as have any right therein, according to such 
right.

tion cannot be made without material injury to the parties,

facts.

for good cause shown, upon exception, the court shall con­

tion, and then by the party failing to disclose.

or the qualification of a successor, the applicant sur~ty is
exonerated from all liability accruing subsequently. 
§ 3677. The exoneration of the applicant surety does not
affect the previous liability of any of the obligors in the
original bond; nor are any of the obligors, who have not
joined in such application, discharged from any liability
accruing after the filing of such additional bond; and the
obligors, who are not exonerated, are liable to any person
injured by a breach of such bonds, in the same or separate 
actions. ·
§ 3678. The sureties in either bond, who have been com­ 
pelled to make payments thereon for the principal, have the
same remedies against the sureties in all the bonds in force
at the time of default, as co-sureties in the same bond have
against each other, the recovery being properly proportioned
according to the penalties of the several bonds.

STATE OF TENNESSEE, } 
--- county.
To the Sheriff; etc., ( or to .A. B., as the case may be : ) 
You are hereby commanded to have· the body of C. D.,
who is alleged to be unlawfully detained by you, before the 
Court, ( or before me, or before E. F ., Judge,
etc., as the case may be,) at on (or 
immediately after being served with this writ.) to be dealt
with according to law, and have you then and there this
writ with a return thereon of your doings in the premises. 
This day of 18 . 
G. II., Judge, etc. 
§ 3728. When the writ is allowed by a court in term, it is
issued· by the clerk, but, in other cases, the Judge or Chan- 
cellor issues thewrit himself, signing it officially. 
§ 3729. It is the duty of the court or Judge to act upon such 
app ications mstanter, an a wrong u an wi u re usa to
grant the writ, when properly applied for, is a· misdemeanor 
m office, besides subjectim.g the Judge to damages at the suit
of the party aggrieved. 
§ 3730. Whenever any court or· J udge, authorized to grant
hi it h id f  a· 9 l di h 
t is wri , as evi ence, rom a JU icia procee mg, t at any
person within the jurisdiction of such court or officer 
is illegally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, it is the
duty of such court or Judge to issue, or cause to be issued,
the writ as aforesaid, although no application be made there-
for. 
§ 3731. The writ may be served by the sheriff, coroner, or
constable, or any other person appointed for that purpose by 
the court or Judge by whom it is issued or allowed. If 
served by any other person than the sheriff, he possesses the
same power, and is liable to the same penalty for nonper­
formance of his duty, as though he were the sheriff. 
§ 3732. The proper mode of service is by leaving a copy of
the original writ with the defendant, and making the return 
upon the original. 
§ 3733. If the defendant cannot be found, or if he have not
the plaintiff in custody, the service may be made upon any
person having the plaintiff in his custody, in the same manner,
and with the same effect, as though he had been made a de- 
fendant therein.
§ 3734. If the defendant refuse admittance to the person 
attempting to serve the writ, conceal himself, or attempt
wrongfully to carry the plaintiff out of the county or State, 
he may be arrested by the person having the writ, and
brought, together with the plaintiff, immediately before the
officer or court before whom the writ is returnable. 
§ 3735. In order to make such arrest, the sheriff, or other
person having the writ, has the same power as is given to a 
sheriff for the arrest of a person charged with a felony. 
§ 3736. If the person in whose name the application is 
made, can be found, and no one appear to have the charge
or custody of him, the person having the writ may take him 
into custody, and make return accordingly; and to get pos-
session of the plaintiff's person in such case, he possesses the
same power as is given by the last section for the arrest of 
§ 3737. The court or Judge to whom the application for the 
writ is made, if satisfied that the plaintiff is likely to suffer
irreparable injury before he could be relieved by the pro­
ceedings as above authorized, may issue a precept to the
sheriff or other person selected, commanding him to bring
the plaintiff forthwith before such Judge or court. 
§ 3738. When the evidence is further sufficient to justify the
arrest of the defendant, for a criminal offence committed in 
connection with the ille~al detention of the plaintiff, the
precept shall also contam an order for the arrest of the 
defendant. 
§ 3739. The officer, or person to whom the precept is directed,
shall execute the same by bringing the defendant, and also 
the plaintiff if required, before the court or Judge issuing it,
and thereupon the defendant shall make return to the writ
of habeas corpus, in the same manner as if the ordinary
course had been pursued. 
§ 3740. The defendant may also be examined and committed,
.bailed, or discharged, according to the nature of the case. 
§ 3741. The writ of habeas corpus shall not be disobeyed for
any defect of form, or misdescription of the plaintiff or 
defendant, provided enough is stated to show the meaning
and intent of the writ. 
§ 3742. Any person served with the writ is presumed to be
the person for whom it is intended, although it may be directed 
to him by a wrong name or description, or to another person.
§ 3743. Service being made in any of the modes herein­ 
before provided, the defendant shall appear at the proper
time, and make due return of the writ, and answer the peti­ 
tion, if required.
§ 3744. The person served with the writ, shall state in his 
return, plainly and unequivocally,
1. Whether he then has, or at any time has had, the party 
in his control or restraint, and, if so, the authority and cause
thereof, setting out the same fully. 
2. If the party is detained under a writ, warrant, or other
written authority, a copy thereof shall be annexed to the re­
turn, and the original shall be produced and exhibited to the
court or Judge, if required. 
3. If the person on whom the writ has been served, has
had the plaintiff in his custody or power, or under his re­
straint, at any time before or after the date of the writ, but
has transferred him to another person, he shall state the facts
explicitly, and to whom, at what time, for what cause, and
by what authority such transfer was made. 
§ 3745. The return shall be signed by the person making it,
and verified by his oath; unless he is a sworn public officer,
and makes the return in his official capacity. 
§ 3746. At the time of making the return, the person on
whom the same has been served shall also produce the body
of the person detained, according to the command of the
writ, or show good cause for not doing so. 
§ 3747. If the cause shown for not producing such person
be sickness or infirmity, the fact shall be verified by affidavit, 
and other evidence if required. 
§ 3748. The court may thereupon proceed as if the party were
produced, or adjourn to the place where such party then is, or 
to some other time and place, according to circumstances. 
§ 3749. The plaintiff may demur or reply to the return, and
all issues shall be tried b, the court or Judge in a summary 
way, the examination bemg adjourned from time to time, if
necessary to the proper administration of justice, and all such
orders being made for the custody of the plaintiff, in the 
meantime, as the nature of the case requires.
§ 3750. The plaintiff may also, in any case, be committed, 
let to bail, or his bail diminished or increased, as justice may
require. 
§ 3751. If no sufficient legal cause of detention is shown,
the plaintiff shall be discharged. 
§ 3752. Although the commitment of the person detained
may have been irregular, still, if the court or Judge is satis- 
fied, from the examination, that he ought to be held to bail,
or committed, either for the offence charged, or any other,
the order should be made accordingly. 
§ 3753. The plaintiff, in writing, or his attorney, may waive
his right to be present at the examination, in which case the 
proceedin~s may be had in his absence.
§ 3754. Disobedience of the original writ, or any subsequent 
order thereon, subjects the defendant to commitment for
contempt, and also to a forfeiture of one thousand dollars to
the party aggrieved, besides rendering him liable for all dam­ 
ages sustained in consequence of such disobedience.
§ 3755. The attempt to elude the service of the writ ofOrattemp~to 
habeas corpus, or to avoid the effect thereof by transferring
the plaintiff to another, or by concealing him, is a high mis­ 
demeanor, for which the guilty person, and any one know- 
ingly aiding or abetting him therein, shall be fined, on con-
viction, not more than one thousand dollars, and imprisoned
not more than one year. 
§ 3756. Subpama for witnesses in all proceedings under this chapter, may be issued by the court or Judge granting the
writ, or before whom the same is returnable, or by any
Justice of the Peace. 
§ 3757. Witnesses thus summoned are subject to the same
penalties, and entitled to the same privileges and fees, as
other witnesses. 
§ 3758. Upon failure of the witness to attend, the fact shall 
be noted by the officer before whom the subpcena is returned,
on the back thereof, and transmitted to the Clerk of the
Circuit Court of the county, who shall issue scire facias as
in other cases. 
§ 3759. Any officer refusing to deliver a copy of any legal
process by which he retains a party in custody, to a person 
who demands such copy, and tenders the fees therefor, for­
feits two hundred dollars to the person so detained. 
§ 3760. The proceedings under a writ of habeas corpus, in­
eluding all the papers in the cause, and the final order, shall
be returned by the Judge to his nearest court, to be there
filed by the clerk as other records, a brief memorandum
thereof duly indexed, being made upon the judgment or
execution docket, and such clerk taxing the costs and issuing
execution therefor, as in other cases. 
§ 3761. The party detained shall be remanded to custody, if 
it appears he is detained, 
1. By virtue of process issued by a court or Judge of the
United States, in a case where such court or Judge has ex­
clusive jurisdiction.

detained has not expired. 
3. In every case in which the detention is authorized by
law. 
§ 3762. The costs of proceedings under this chapter, except

court or Judge may think right, and taxed and collected 
as in other cases.
§ 3763. Where the defendant in a criminal prosecution, is 
brought before any Circuit or Criminal Judge on a writ
of habeas corpus, and discharged by the Judge, the costs
shall be paid as in other State cases, when the defendant is

preceding section is charged with a felony, the Judge shall

paid out as in other cases.

the J udgc shall deliver the bill of costs, made out and certi­ 
fied as before, to the County Court of the county in which

any person acquainted with the facts, stating the contents 
thereof, as near as may be, and that such instrument has
been unintentionally lost or mislaid, and is still the property
of the person claiming under it, unpaid and unsatisfied. 
§ 3902. So, also, if such instrument is wrongfully in the
possession of the opposite party, who fails to produce it upon 
notice, its place may be supplied by the affidavit of any
person acquainted with the facts, stating the contents as
near as may be, the wrongful possession of the opposite 
party, notice to produce, and that such instrument rs the
property of the person claiming under it, unpaid and unsatis- 
fied. 
§ 3903. If the instrument is one which the law requires should
be denied under oath, the affidavit produced before or at the 
trial, will be sufficient to establish the claimant's right,
whether he is plaintiff or defendant; and, if denied under
oath, or otherwise legally put in issue, may be established
by competent evidence of its contents. 
§ 3904. The court or Justice before whom the action is
tried, may, in case recovery i9 had upon a lost instrument, 
require the party claiming under it, to give bond with good
security, in double the amount of the claim, payable to the
opposite party, and conditioned to indemnify such party
against any demand by action on such lost instrument; and
execution shall be stayed until such bond is given. 
§ 3905. The person recovering on such lost instrument may,
however, after the lapse of two years from the maturity of 
such instrument, enforce his recovery without giving the
bond prescribed in the last section ; in which case the per- 
son from whom the recovery is had, may plead the judg-
ment in bar of an action by the actual holder of such lost
instrument. 
§ 3906. If the actual holder of such lost instrument brings
his action thereon after the recovery had as aforesaid, the 
true owner may intervene, and defend the action.

either at law or equity, if l?st or mislaid un~ntcntionally, ~r
fraudulently made away with, may be supphed, upon appli-

the nature of the case will admit of. 
§ 3908. If the lost papers consist of depositions, the court
may, in its discretion, order the testimony to be retaken, if
the witnesses are alive.

§ 4312. Suite are commenced in the Court of Chancery by
bill or petition, addressed to the Chancellor of the division
in which the same is filed, specifying the particular court in
which it is filed, or by motion in open court, where that
mode of procedure is allowed by law. 
§ 4313. The address should be followed by the names and
residences of the parties, and may be substantially as follows: 
"To the Honorable S. D. F., Chancellor, etc., holding the
Chancery Court at 
A. B., Citizen of complainant. }
vs. 
C. D. and E. F., Citizens of defendants.
The complainant respectfully shows to the court.".
§ 4314. The bill should contam a clear and orderly statement 
of the facts on which the suit is founded, without prolixity or
repetition, and conclude with a prayer for the required
process and appropriate relief, without averring any formal
combination or confederacy by the defendants or others, the
insufficiency of the remedy at law, or other mere formal
matter. 
§ 4315. The answer should, in like manner, contain a clear
and orderly statement of the facts on which the defence is
founded, without prolixity or repetition, and with a prayer of
dismissal or counter relief, according to the nature of the case. 
§ 4316. It is the duty of the court to discountenance pro­
lixity, and unnecessary and false allegations, in all Chancery 
pleadings; and for this purpose the court may, of its own
motion, or upon application of the opposite party, refer the
pleadings to the master to be revised, or order particular
parts to be stricken out, and charge the party in. fault with 
the unnecessary costs.
§ 4317. The plaintiff may, in his bill, waive an answer from 
the defendant under oath, in which case the answer will be
entitled to no more weight than the bill as evidence. 
§ 4318. The defendant may incorporate all matters of de-
fence in his answer, and is not required to plead specially in 
any case, except to the jurisdiction of the court.
§ 4319. Neither is he required to demur, except for the want 
of jurisdiction of the subject-matter, or of the person, but he
may have all the benefit of a demurrer by relymg thereon in
his answer. . 
§ 4320. And either party may, upon such answer, set down
the matters of demurrer for argument at the next term of the 
court, but not so as "to prevent preparing the cause for a
hearing; and the court may charge the defendant with any
costs occasioned by the failure to rely upon the formal plea
or demurrer, or to set down the sameat the proper time. 
§ 4321. The filing of an answer is a waiver of objection to
the jurisdiction of the court, and the cause shall not be dis- 
missed, but heard and determined upon its merits, although
the court may be of opinion that the matters complained of
are of legal cognizance. 
§ 4322. No replication or other pleading, after answer filed,
is required or allowed, but all cases will be heard as if repli- 
cation had been filed, unless set for hearing expressly on bill
and answer. 
§ 4323. The defendant may, by proper allegations, file his
answer as a cross-bill, and require a discovery from the com- 
plainant, in which case demurrer or pleas may be filed, or
other proceedings had upon the answer as upon a-crose-bill. 
§ 4324. And the court shall act upon all the matters properly
involved in the pleadings, and give such relief, either for the
plaintiff or the defendant, as the nature of the case requires, 
to do complete justice.
§ 4325. Multifariousness, misjoinder, or nonjoinder of parties, 
is no sufficient cause for the dismission of a bill in equity,
unless objection is made by motion to dismiss or demurrer. 
§ 4326. If a demurrer for multifariousness is sustained, the
court may authorize amendments, by directing separate bills 
to be filed without new process as to the parties before the
court, and by the addition of new parties, or otherwise, as
may be deemed necessary for the attainment of justice. 
§ 4327. The uniting in one bill of several matters of equity,
distinct and unconnected, against one defendant, is not mul- 
tifariousness.
§ 4328. If the ~lain tiff do not except to the answer within 
the time prescribed by law, the issue shall be regarded as
made in the same way as if replication had been filed, and
the cause shall stand for trial at the first term of the court
after answer· :filed ; and if at that or any other term the 
cause is continued, it shall stand for hearing at the next term.
