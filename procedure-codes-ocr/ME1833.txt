6. But if it is, no review can be had of either one of the judgments in
partition, without the other. Therefore, where the judgment quod partitio
fiat was rendered upon demurrer, the title of the petitioners not being con
tested, but a mistake was made by the commissioners, which was not dis
covered till after the final judgment; it was held that a review could not be
granted, for the correction of this error. lb.
7. By the subsequent statute of Feb. 7, 1828, judgments upon petitions
for partition are open to review. See ch. 384, vol. 3, p. 233. But the ap

5. The design of the legislature appears to have been, that a defendant
should not be called to answer out of his own county, except in n county
where a plaintiff lived, or where a defendant lived, unless all the plaintiffs
lived out of the State; in which case, the plaintiff or plaintiffs might elect
their county. Day If al. vs. Jackson If al. 5 Mass. 239.

AN ACT respecting tlie Attachment of Property on Mesne Process, and directing

Sect. 1. JL>K it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives, in Legislature assembled, That all goods and

estate attached (a) upon mesne process for the security of the

Ch. 60.

(a) 1. The right of attaching property, as security for the judgment a plain
tiff may finally recover, is a provision not known to the common law. Lind
say vs. Larned, 17 Mass. 196.
2. Property attached on mesne process may be sold with consent of partics, as on execution, by ch. 508, vol. 3, p. 356.
3. Estate holilcn by virtue of a bond to convey, is liable to attachment and
may be sold in the same manner as an equity of redemption, by eft. 431,
vol. 3, p. 274.
4. An actual entry, by the officer, on real estate, seems not to be neces
sary to constitute a valid attachment. Crosby vs. Allyn, 6 Glf. 453.
5. Nor need he enter a meeting house to attach a pew.
Leavitt, 13 Mass. 128.

Perrin vt.

6. To constitute an attachment of goods, the officer must have the actual
possession and custody of them. Lane $■ al. vs. Jackson, 5 Mass. 163;
Watson If al. vs. Todd fy al. ib. 271.
7. Where an officer, who had attached personal property on an original
writ delivered the same to a stranger, taking an accountable receipt for the
same, a return by him of an attachment of such property in a second suit
against the same person, without an actual seizure of it, does not bind the
property. Knap vs. Sprague, fl Mass. 258.
But in Luddon vs. Leavitt, 9 Mass. 104, and Perley vs. Foster, ib.
114, and Warren vs. Leland, ib. 265, the special property and constructive
possession, seems to have been considered as remaining in the officer after
the goods had been delivered over by him to the bailee; the bailee being con
sidered as his servant. So in Bond vs. Padelford, 13 Mass. 394, and Com
monwealth vs. Morse, 14 Mass. 217. And in Brownell vs. Manchester, 1
Pick. 232, where the goods attached were delivered to a bailee and after
wards came into the possession of the debtor, it was held, that the officer
had such possession as to maintain trespass against him, who took them from
the bailee and delivered them to the debtor. In Lyman vs. Lyman, 11 Mass.
319, it was held, in an action against the bailee on his promise to deliver the
goods attached, that it was not competent for him, or the debtor, to object
to the validity of the attachment for want of actual seizure or possession of
the goods by the officer. And in Whittier vs. Smith, 11 Mass. 311, in a
like action where goods attached had been delivered to the bailee, and be
fore the return day, were demanded to be taken on another suit; and after
wards the first suit was abandoned, and another instituted by the same plain
tiff, whereon the goods were attached and sold on execution, which issued
on the judgment in that suit; held that these facts furnished no defence to the
suit. So in Jewell vs. Tony, 11 Mass. 219, it was held in a like action that
the bailee could not orject to the wont of seizin or possession by the officer.
The only ground, upon which the case of Knap vs. Sprague can be supported
is that stilted in Cooper vs. Morey & al 16 Mass. 6, viz. that "the officer
bus no action against the receiptors, if he made no demand of the chattels

ATTACHMENT OF PROPERTY.

debt or damages sued for, shall be held for the space of
within thirty days after the judgment; where the goods shall have been in
the possession of the debtor." But such demand has been held not to be
necessary, where the debtor has sent the property out of the Commonwealth,
or where a demand would have been nugatory. Wtbtter vs. Coffin, 14
Mass. 196.
8. Where an officer attaches a debtor's cattle, the debtor is bound to
support them, after notice to him by the officer that they are attached. If
he neglects to do it, and they perish from that cause, the loss will be his.
They are at his risk. And the officer who attaches them is answerable to
the creditor for them ; and his apprehension in incurring expense in their
maintenance furnishes no excuse for his neglect. Sewall If als. vs. Maltoon,
9 Mass. 536.
9. Nor can the deputy in such case shew in mitigation of damages, that
the expense of keeping the cattle between the attachment and the execution
would have exceeded the value of the cattle. Tyler vs. {Timer, 1 2 Mass. 163.
1 0. The value ofthe cattle at the time the execution should have been levied ,
and not at the time of the attachment, forms the true measure of damages. lb.
11. When chattels have been attached by a deputy sheriff, it is not in the
power of another deputy of the same sheriff to make a second attachment of
the same chattels; although the amount first attached is more than sufficient
to secure the attaching creditor. Vinton vs. Bradford, 13 Mass. 114.
See below, 13; also onward, § 20, 21.
12. In such case no overt act of the first deputy is necessary to constitute
a second attachment. Turner vs. Austin, 16 Mass. 185.
1 3. Where a deputy sheriff attached goods, and within thirty days after
judgment seized them in execution but failed to sell them; another deputy
was justified in seizing them on another execution, in the hands of the bailee,
notwithstanding he had notice of the first seizure. Warren vs. Lcland, 9
Mats. 265; Gibbs vs. Chase, 10 Mass. 129.
14. If a deputy sheriff has attached goods on mesne process, and after
judgment has been recorded for the plaintiff, and execution has issued, the
latter require the deputy to deliver the goods attached to him, so that he may
procure his execution to be levied upon them, the deputy is not bound to de
liver them, he being alike accountable to the debtor for them as to the cred
itor, until sold on execution. Blake vs. Shaw, 7 Mass. 506.
15. Goods attached on mesne process may be lawfully sold by the sher
iff on execution, the judgment debtor dying insolvent after the judgment and
before the salo. Grosvenor vs. Gould, 9 Mass. 211; See § 32, of this
chapter, and notes thereto.
16. But when there was no attachment on the mesne process, and the
sheriff had not begun to execute the execution, the debtor having died after
the issuing the execution, the sheriff cannot seize goods thereon after such
death. Jewett vs. Smith, 12 Mass. 309.
17. Where two creditors caused the same land of the debtor to be attach-

ed at the same time, and their several executions to be duly levied within
thirty days after judgment, each was adjudged to take a moiety of the land
so attached and levied upon. Shove vs. Dow, IS Mats. 629.
(o) 1. Judgment is presumed to be entered on the last day of the term, onless on notice it be in fact entered previously, in which case the time is min
uted; and the "thirty days" are to be reckoned accordingly. Herring If
ul. et. Polley, 8 Mass. 113.
2. The day after the last day of the term is the first day of the thirty.
Portland Sank vs. Maine Bank, 11 Mass. 204.
3. Where the " thirty days" expire on Sunday, the lien does not extend
into the following day. Alderman vs. Phelps, 15 Mass. 225.
4. If land attached on mesne process be seized on execution within thirty
days from the judgment, it is sufficient although the proceedings on the exe
cution are not completed until after thirty days have expired; and in such
case the officer may date his return as of the day of the seizure, to which
day all the after proceedings have relation. Heytcood vs. Hildreth, 9
Mass. 393. See onward, note j 2.
5. See note to § 8, ch. 67, in this volume.
(r) In real actions, no lien can be created by attachment. The provision
of § 1, does not extend to real actions. Holmes vs. Fernald, 7 Glf. 232.
(d) 1. The sheriff cannot retain goods attached on mesne process, after judg
ment is rendered for the defendant on an appeal, although the plaintiff re
views the action. Clap vs. Bell, 4 Mass. 99.
2. The submission of an action, and all demands existing between the
parties, to the determination of referees, dissolves any attachment of proper
ty made in that action; and this whether other demands are in fact exhibited
to the referees or not. Mooney If ux. vs. Kavanagh If al. 4 Glf. 277.
3. So where in an action of assumpsit a settlement of all accounts was
made by the parties and judgment rendered for the plaintiff on the balance due
him, which included some demands for which there was no proper count in
the writ, it was held that the lien created by his attachment was thereby dis
solved in toto, so far as the rights of subsequent attaching creditors wero
concerned. Clark vs. Foxcroft, 1 Glf. 348.

2. Where one of two or more judgment creditors die after judgment and
before execution issues, the execution ought regularly to issue in the name of
all the creditors; but if it issue in the name of the survivor only, it is not
therefore void. Hamilton vs. Lyman, 9 Mass. 15.
(ft) A Justice of the Peace who issued an execution in two or three
hours after he had rendered judgment, was holden liable to the party against
whom such execution issued, and who was imprisoned thereon, in an action
of trespass. Briggs vs Wardwell, 10 Mass. 856.

Mass. 477.
(j ) 1. After the time when an execution is to be returned, it cannot be exe
cuted by taking the body, goods or estate of the debtor. When it is return
able in three months, it may be executed on the last day of these months.
When returnable to a court to be holden at a certain day, it may be execut
ed at any time on that day, while the court is setting, but not after the court
is adjourned to the next day. Prescott vs. Wright, 6 Mass. 22.
2. But if the officer has begun to execute it at any time before it is re

2. If one of two judgment debtors elect an appraiser to appraise land be
longing to both, nr to him only, it is sufficient; otherwise if the land belong

Herring vs. Polley, 8 Mais. 113.

3 . If the real estate to be extended upon lay in different parts of the counly, different appraisers may be selected and employed. Boylsten vs. Car

4. In levying upon these several tracts of land belonging to the debtor it
is not necessary that a several appraisement be made of each. Barnard vs.
Fisher, 7 Mass. 71; Bond vs. Bond, 2 Pick. 382.
(q) 1. Six hours notice to the judgment debtor, of an extent about to be

his last and usual place of abode. Cut whether any notice in such case is
necessary — Qucre. Buck vs. Hardy, 6 Glf. 1G2. See above, notep, I.
(r) When a sheriff returns upon an execution that he has appointed two

creditors, bis or their attorney. And when the real estate of
the debtor or debtors shall be held in joint (x) tenancy, in co
parcenary or tenancy in common with the real estate of other
reason must be given why the third did not. Whitman vs. Tyler & als. S
Mass. 2S4 ; Maffit vs. Jaqains & al. 2 Pick. 3S1. Where the officer's re
tain states that A. B. and C. were appraisers, and A. B. and D. were in fact
the persons who acted as appraisers, and whose names are signed to the ap
praisement, the return is invalid. Nye vs. Drake, 9 Pick. 35. But in Bar
rett vs. Porter, 14 Mass. 143, it was holden, that where it appeared on the
return of the officer, that three appraisers were appointed and sworn, and
that all the three had acted in the appraisement ; although the certificate was
subscribed by two only, and no reason given why the third did not subscribe,
the return might be sustained.
2. The power of setting oil' the estate comprehends the power of giving
access to it ; so where land of a debtor is set off, to which there is no access
bnt over other lands of the debtor, the sheriff and appraisers may set off to
tho creditor, a right of passage over such other lands, either separately or
with the debtor. Taylor vs. Townsend, 8 Mats. 411. See ante, m, 1.

may bo a sufficient description of the lands. Boylston vs. Carver, 11 Mass.
516. See Carpenter If ux. vs. Sutton, 7 Pick. 49.
2. A reference for a description of land levied upon, to an inventory of
an estate, was held insufficient. Tate tr al. vs. Anderson, 9 Mass. 92. See
McGregor If al.vs. Brown, 5 Pick. 170.
(u>) 1. A return of the sheriff that he delivered seizin and possession of the
land taken, to the agent, instead of the attorney of the creditor, is sufficient.
Pratt & al. vs. Putnam, 13 Mass. 361.
2. An attorney for such purpose need not be constituted by deed. lb.
3. The neglect of the creditor for a month after the seizure and appraise
ment, to receive seizin, was adjudged an unreasonable delay, and such la

4. An execution duly levied on land of the debtor, and possession by the
creditor, is a satisfaction of the judgment, although the same be not recorded

of § 7, the trustee is bound by the result of the ulterior litigation in the suit
between the creditor and assignee, in the same manner as they are, though
he had no agency in making up the issue. Fisk 4' «'• vs. Weston 4" tr. 5
Glf. 410.
3. An assignee of a chose in action, iu order to avail himself of the as
signment, in case the debtor should be summoned as the trustee of the as
signor, must notify the debtor and exhibit to him the evidence of the assign
ment, that the debtor may be able to disclose the whole matter to the court.
Wood vs. ParlriJge, 11 Mass. 488; otherwise the trustee will be protect
ed in submitting to be adjudged the trustee of the debtor. lb ; Corns! nek vs.
Farnum 4- tr. 2 Mass. 97; Foster vs. Sinkler 4- tr. 4 Mass. 450.
4. It seems, that where a debtor is summoned as trustee of his creditor,
the court cannot compel him to disclose an assignment of the debt to a third
person, where the trustee does not know the fact of the assignment. Hawes
4- al. vs. Langton Sr trs. 8 Pick. 67. See Adams If al. vs. Cordis, ib.
270.
5. Whether the assignment is regarded as invalid, by the default of the
assignee to become a party, or in consequence of its being found so upon tri
al, it is not expressly provided that the trustee shall be no longer answerable
to the assignee. But this results necessarily from the proceedings. "And
we entertain no doubt that these proceedings, properly pleaded, would be
holden to be an effectual bar against any action, subsequently bronght by the
assignee against the trustee." Fisk 4* al. vs. Weston, 5 Glf. 412.
(s) Where'a trustee upon his examination discloses an assignment of his
debt to a third person, the court will not yield to a suggestion from the at
taching creditor that the assignment is fraudulent. For such a purpose the
assignee should have been made trustee. Garden vs. Webb Sf tr. 13 Mass.

(u) The reason for providing that the scire facias may be sued against the
trustees jointly or severally, undoubtedly was, that they would frequently
have no connexion with each other, and the creditor might find it expedient

Thorndike vs. DeWolf, If trs. 6 Pick. 123. In this case, Parker, C. J.
stated the rale as abovo, and remarked : "This was settled in tho caso of
Howell vs. Freeman & tr. 3 Mass. 121. It had been better perhaps origi
nally, that the commencement of a sait against the debtor should havo ex
empted him from the trustee process, and it was so determined in the case of
Gridley vs. Ilarraden, found in the appendix of 14 Mass. p. 496. This case
was decided in the year 1780, under the old provincial trusteo act passed in
32 Geo. 2. Under the present existing statute, it has never been determined,
that the mere commencement of a suit for a debt prevents the operation of
the statute. On the contrary, this process has been maintained, after such
suit commenced, as in the case of Locke vs. Tippets & trs. 7 Mass. 14S;
Kidd vs. Shepherd, 4 Mass. 238, and Foster vs. Jones, 15 Mass. 185."
2. It is no cause to abate a writ, that the defendant has been sued as the
trustee of tho plaintiff, and that the process is still pending: but it is ground
for a continuance while the process is pending: and during such continuan
ces the plaintiff may not tax costs for travel and attendance. Winthrop vs.
Carlton jr. 8 Mass. 456. See ante, note k, 2, p. 362. Yet a trustee judg
ment is no protection to the trustee, against the claims of the person whoso
effects or credits were in his hands, unless it has been satisfied. Wise vs.
Hilton, 4 Olf. 435.
3. It is competent for one, whose debtor attempts to discharge himself by
shewing that ho has paid on a trustee process, or that he had discharged him
self from that action on oath, to prove thai tho debt still remains due. Groves

to be a forgery; but said, if it could be proved that he signed the note, he

AN ACT directing the Process in Habeas Corpus.
Whereas the writ commonly called the Writ of Habeas Corpus is a writ of right Preamble. to which the citizens of this State, by the constitution and the law of the land are
at all times entitled, to obtain relief from every wrungful imprisonment, or un
lawful restraint of personal liberty:

Sect. 1. _I5k it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives, in Legislature assembled, That any person
imprisoned in any common gaol, or otherwise restrained of
his personal liberty by any officer or officers, or any other
person or persons for any cause or upon any pretence whatever, he, or any (a) person in his behalf, may complain, in
writing, to* the Supreme Judicial Court of this State, or to any
one Judge of said Court, in term time in any county, or to
any one or more of the Judges thereof in the vacation time
of the said Court ; and upon such complaint, and upon view
of the copy of the warrant, (if any there be,) by which such
person stands committed, or upon his affidavit certified by a
Justice of the Peace, or on the oath of the person applying
on bis behalf, or any other credible witness, or upon the affi(o) 1. If a minor is withheld from bis parents or guardians against their will,
the court willput him at liberty from such restraint, although the minor may
not wish it. Com. vs. Harrison, 11 Mass. 65.
2 . Where a female child, between eleven and twelve years of age, whoso
father was dead, was committed by her mother to the respondent, a member
of the society of Shakers, on a verbal contract for her support and education ,
and afterwards a guardian was appointed who claimed the custody of the
child, and obtained a writ of habeas corpus directed to the respondent, the
court refused to determine in this summary process, npon the rights of tho
mother and of the guardian, and ordered that the child might remain with the
respondent or go at large, at her election. Com. vs. Hammond, 10 Pick.
274.
3. A husband and wifo having separated, pursuant to articles previously
entered into, in which he had stipulated that in the event of such separation
the children should remain with her ; the court, on habeas corpus sued out
at bis request, ordered the children into the custody of the mother, pursuant
to the articles of separation; she living with her father, and they being of an
age to require her care. State vs. Smith, 6 Glf. 462.
4. Independent of such articles, the court in such cases, will exercise its
sound discretion, the father having no vested right, in any case, to tho ex
clusive custody of his children, lb.

in execution.

the case be one where legal process has been abused, and injuriously em

Sect. 1. 15 E it enacted by

Representatives, in Legislature assembled, That when any
persons who may have a dispute, of what nature soever, shall
agree to have the dispute determined by referees mutually
chosen by the parties for the purpose, it shall and may be

his or their hands in writing, and to lodge the same with some
one Justice of the Peace (c) ; and the said Justice of the
Peace, upon application of the parties for the purpose, shall
make out an agreement to be annexed (d) to the aforesaid
(a) 1. Though the power of referees appointed under this statute, does not
extend to cases in which the title to real estate conies in question, [Fowler
vs. Bigelow If at. S Matt. 1.] yet a claim of damages occasioned by the
making of a canal, not being of that character, comes within the scope of
their authority. Fryeburg Canal vs. Frye, 5 Glf. 38.
2. The submission of an action, and all demands existing between the
parties, to the determination of referees, dissolves any attachment of proper
ty made in that action ; and this, whether their demands are in fact exhib
ited to the referees or not. Moonty !f ux. vs. Kavanagh tf al. 4 Glf. 277.
See onward, note c, 7.
3. Such submission also operates as a waiver of all exceptions to the forms
of process, or may be considered as a release of errors, or as an estoppel to
the assignment of errors, in the proceedings anterior to such submission.
Fursuit h vs. Shaw, 10 Muss. 253.
(o) 1. Where a submission is of divers subjects distinctly enumerated, if it
appears from the whole award that all matters submitted have been adjudica
ted upon by the arbitrators it is sufficient, though each particular is not speci
fied in the award. Dolbearvs. IVing, 3 Glf. 421.
2. A submisson, once made a rule of court, is no longer countermandable by either party. Cumberland vs. JV. Yarmouth, 4 Glf. 459.
(c) The justice who takes the acknowledgment of the parties to such rule
cannot himself be one of the referees. Drew vs. Canady, 1 Mass. 158.
(rf) 1. The demand must be annexed to the rule, or it will be void.

2. So, if the demand annexed is not subscribed by the persons making it

of —— in the count; of —— [addition] and C D of

[addition] have agreed to submit the demand made by the said A B against the
said C D which is hereunto annexed, (and all other demands, as the cause may be,)

Pleas, to be holden in and for the said county of S

proper notice being given them, of the time and place appointed by the referees, for
hearing the parties in this action, the referees shall have power to proceed ex parte.

shall be made to the next (/) Circuit Court of Common [lb. § 3.]
*c. without being subscribed by liim. Humphrey vs. Strong, 14 Mas*.
262. So, where a demand on which a writ had been sued out and endorsed
by the plaintiff, was referred, the annexation of the writ to the rule was holden a sufficient demand in writing, &c. Jnman vs. Wheeler, 1 Pick. 50 1.
3. If a copartnership demand be signed by one of the copartners, it is a
sufficient compliance with the statute. Shillings vs. Coolidge $■ at. 14 Mats.
43.
4. The report of referees cannot be made respecting any matters not con
tained in the agreement of submission. Tudor vs. Peek, 4 .Mass. 242.
5. The statement of the demand must shew on what account and for
what cause it is made, or the report will be void. Junes vs. Haekir 5 Mass.
264.
6. Where demands made by one party only are submitted to arbitratora, if a sum be awarded to the other party, no remedy lies on such award.
Worthen If al. vs. Stevens, 4 Mass. 448.
7. When parties have submitted all demands, and judgment has been en
tered on the report of the referees including all the demands submitted to
them, it is still competent for one of the parties to show that a particular de
mand, not being in dispute, was not laid before the referees, and to maintain
an action on such demand. Webster vs. Lee, 5 Mass. 334.
(f ) The reference must be to three referees.

Monosiet vs. Post fy al.

be void. Molt vs. Anthony, 5 Mass. 489 ; Southworth vs. Bradford,

If the court had commenced

its session previous to making the award, the report of the referees cannot be

Pleas to whom the report of the referees may be made as
aforesaid, shall have cognizance thereof in the same way and
manner, and the same doings shall be had thereon (»), as

'

ed thereon, such judgment will bo reversed on writ of error.
Merrill, 1 Mass. 411.

Durrell vs.

2. Bat if the report be seasonably made, and recommitted, it may be re
ceived again either with, or without an amendment, at the same, or any sub
sequent term. JVhitney, atlm. vs. Cook, 5 Mass. 142 ; Buardmom vs.
England, 6 Mass. 71.
•' • ■
3. If the referees agree upon their report during a session of the court,
sne.h report is regularly to be returned at the next succeeding term of the
court. Walker vs. Melcher, 14 Mass. 148.
4. Where the referees agreed npon their report before the sitting of the
court to which it was returned, but had signed and dated it on the second
day of the term, they were not allowed to airuind, by altering the date so ns
to make it returnable at the time intended. A'oyes vs. JVoycs, 1 Pick. 269.
See Gerrishvs. Morss, 2 Pick. 625.
(g) 1. It is no valid objection to a report of referees, that one of them had
formed a previous opinion upon the case submitted to them, if his mind ap
pears to have been still open to conviction, and no imputation of unfairness
rests upon him. Graves vs. Fisher if al. 5 Olf. 69. Nor is the partiality
of a referee a valid objection, if known and not objected to by the party be
fore the hearing was had. .Foartif. Hazelton, 10 Pick. 275.
2. Reports of referees, whether made under a rule of court, or under a
submission before a justice, pursuant to the statute, may be recommitted by
the court at their discretion, as well for the revision of the whole case, as for
the amendment of matters of form. Cumberland vs. A1". Yarmouth, 4 Gff.
459.
3. If the report be recommitted the referees are not obliged to alter it,
but may again return it, without hearing the parties ; if they are fully satis
fied of the correctness of it. May $• al. vs. Haven, 9 Mass. 325.
4. If a report made by three referees be recommitted, and one of them
neglect or refuse to sit again, the other two are competent to make a newaward similar to the former, with additional costs. Peterson vs. Loring,
1 Off. 64.
5. If the referees, or one of them in case of a recommitment, should re
fuse to re-examine the subject, the court may enforce obedience to the order
of recommitment, by mandamus, or attachment. Cumberland vs. A'orth
Yarmouth, 4 Glf. 459.
6. After the recommitment of a report, it is not competent for two of the

REFEREES.

though the same had been made by referees appointed by a
rule of the same Court.
Sect. 3. Be it further enacted, That where the parties
shall agree that the determination of the referees may be
.
'
made known, prior to its being made to the Circuit Court of
Common Pleas as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for
the referees to make known the determination to the parties,
without its affecting in any degree the validity thereof ; and
if the determination shall be so made known to the parties, it
shall and may be lawful for the party who may be found indebted agreeably to the determination aforesaid, to discharge
him or themselves therefrom, and thereby prevent any further
process thereon, by paying the same unto the person or per
sons to whom it may be so awarded.
Sect. 4. Be it further enacted, That the referees who
may be appointed in pursuance of this act, shall be vested
with all the authority, which is possessed by referees appointed by a rule of Court. And witnesses (h) shall be summoned
to appear before them, and be sworn in the same manner* as
witnesses before referees appointed by a rule of Court as
aforesaid.
Sect. 5. Be it further enacted, That upon any report
of referees returned into any Circuit Court of Common Pleas,
• ,.
, .
in pursuance ot this act, and also upon any report made by
referees, in the absence of the third, to revise the essential merits of the
ease. Ib ; Short vs Pratt, 6 Mass. 496.
7. If arbitrators erroneously refuse to consider a particular demand laid
before them, on the mistaken ground that it is not within the submission, the
bond and award are no bar to subsequent action upon the demand thus re
jected. Sixby vs. Whitney, 6 Glf. 192.
8. A report of referees may be good in part, and bad in part.
P. Proprietors, 7 Mass. 420.

Com. vs.

9. If the court refuse to accept a report for defect of authority in the re
ferees, they cannot award costs, but must order the parties to go thereof with
out day. Jones vs. Hacker, 5 Mass. 264.
10. An award that the defendant recover the costs of action, is a suffi
cient determination of the matter submitted ; and warrants a judgment that
the plaintifftake nothing by his writ. Buckland vs. Conway, 16 Mass. 396.

2. The action of replevin is local in its nature, and must be brought in
the county where the goods and chattels are taken or attached. Robinson

3. It is no sufficient plea to a writ of replevin, that the chattels replevied
had been before delivered to the defendant upon his writ of replevin against

[*386]
Court explaining to them its understanding of questions of
law, if any should be proposed, and re-stating what any wit

send them out again for further deliberation ; and if the Jury
should return a second time without being able to agree on a
verdict, they shall not be liable to be sent out a third time,
unless they shall state some legal difficulties for explanation,
which had not been previously attended to by the Court.
And if any person obtaining a verdict in his favour in any Party prcvaiiCourt in this State, shall, during the session of the said Court, the Jury,
in which such verdict shall be obtained, give to any of the
Jurors in said cause, knowing him or them to be such, any
victuals, drink or entertainment (h), or other article by way
of treat or gratuity, whether before or after such verdict, on
due proof thereof, it shall be a sufficient reason, at the dis

to have operated upon any juror so far as to impair his reasoning powers,
inflame his passions, or leave an improper influence upon his opinions, the
verdict would probably be set aside. lb.
