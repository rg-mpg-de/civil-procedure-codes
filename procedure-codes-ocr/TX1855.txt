SEC. 2. Proceedings in civil cases are divided into:
1. Suits.
2. Special proceedings in civil cases.

SEC. 3. A suit is an ordinary proceeding in a Court of justice, by one party against another, for the enforcement or protection of a private right, or the redress or prevention of a private wrong. It may also be brought for the recovery of a penalty, forfeiture, or escheat.

SEC. 5. Where the violation of a right involves both a private and a public wrong, a proceeding for the former is not merged in the latter.

SECTION 1. In general.

SEC. 224. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party or his attorney.

SEC. 225. In all cases of more than on distinct cause of action, defense, counterclaim or reply, the same shall be separately stated and numbered, in default whereof every allegation not essential to a single cause of action, or defense shall on motion be stricken out as redundant. 

SEC. 226. In answering or demurring to a petition which contains several causes of action, and in replying or demurring to an answer which contains several defenses or counterclaims, the cause of action or defense to which each answer, demurrer or reply is intended to relate, shall be designated by its proper number.

SEC. 227. The place and time, if known, or about the time if the exact time be not known, where and when each material fact happened or was done, or, where a fact is continuous, the time within which, it happened or was done, shall be stated.

SEC. 228. The mode in which a material fact was done or took place, where it differs from the general mode of such facts, shall be stated. But the allegations shall not be required to be more specific than the evidence. For example, if the defendant have a receipt which acknowledges payment of the claim sued on, it is sufficient for him to plead payment, although the payment may have been made in labor, merchandize or the like. 

SEC. 229. Every material allegation of the complaint, not controverted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter in the answer, not controverted by the reply, shall for the purposes of the suit be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter in the reply, shall be deemed to be controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial or avoidance. 

SEC. 230. A material allegation is an allegation of fact, which is required by statute to be made, or which could not be stricken out, without rendering the pleading insufficient as a cause of action or ground of defense.

SEC. 231. The facts which are required to be alleged, are the facts to which the law is to be applied in the particular case, as distinguished from mere conclusions of law on the one hand, and mere evidence of the facts on the other.

SEC. 232. If redundant or irrelevant matter, surplusage or tautology be inserted in any pleading, it must, on motion of the adverse party, be stricken out.

SEC. 233. Neither presumptions of law, nor matters of which judicial notice is taken, except private statutes, need to be stated in pleading. 

SEC. 234. The allegations of every pleading shall be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.

SECTION 2. For pleading certain facts. 

SEC. 235. If the complaint or new matter in an answer or reply be founded on an account or written instrument as evidence of indebtedness, the original account or written instrument, or a copy thereof, must be attached to and filed with the pleading; or, if not so attached and filed, a sufficient reason therefore must be shown in the pleading. 

SEC. 236. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the facts, conferring jurisdiction, but it shall be sufficient to state that such judgment or determination, stating the date thereof, was duly given or made by the particular Court or officer, describing them so as to distinguish them from other similar courts and officers. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading it must prove the facts conferring jurisdiction on the court or officer. A certified copy of such judgment or determination must be filed with the pleading.

SEC. 237. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent, it shall be sufficient to state that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading it must prove the facts showing such performance.

SEC. 238. In pleading a private statute of this state, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer such statute by its title and the day of its passage; and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

Chapter V. Mistakes in pleading, and amendments. 

SEC. 239. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof, shall be deemed material, unless it have actually mislead the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his suit or defense upon the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been so misled; and thereupon the court shall order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as shall be just. 

SEC. 240. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the preceding article, the court shall direct an immediate amendment without costs. 

SEC. 241. Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance within the two preceding articles, but a failure of proof. 

SEC. 242. No judgment shall be impaired or deemed erroneous or defective, by reason of any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings, which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party.

SEC. 243. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course, without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before a demurrer thereto shall have been sustained and before the parties shall have announced themselves ready for trial. In such case a copy of the amendment must be delivered to the adverse party or his attorney, except where such party is absent from the county and has not attorney of record.

SEC. 244. No cause shall be delayed by reason of an amendment, except so long as may be required to make up the issues, unless the adverse party show good cause therefore, by affidavit, stating distinctly therein in what respect he has been prejudiced in his preparation for trial, by the amendment. 

SEC. 245. The court, for good cause shown and upon such terms as may be just, must allow an answer or reply to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarge such time.

SEC. 246. Where an amendment or pleading is filed by leave of the court, the adverse party shall have until the next day after the day fixed by law or by the order of the court for the filing of the amendment or pleading, to demur, answer or reply, as the case may be.

SEC. 247. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding, by any name; and when his true name shall be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly. 

SEC. 248. A demurrer shall be determined without respect to amendments made after the demurrer was filed, unless the amendment expressly confess the demurrer and notice thereof be given to the adverse party or his attorney. 

SEC. 249. Where an amendment does not confess the demurrer or notice thereof is not given, if the demurrer is sustained, and the pleading has been perfected by the amendment, the order sustaining the demurrer shall require the pleading as amended, to be answered or replied to on or before the next day.

SEC. 250. Where an amendment confesses the demurrer and is served on the adverse party or his attorney, unless such adverse party answer or reply to the pleading, as amended on or before the next day after such service, the demurrer shall be deemed to apply to such pleading. 

SEC. 251. Where a demurrer is overruled the court may, if it appear that the same was interposed in good faith, allow the party to answer or reply, upon such terms as may be just. 

SEC. 252. Where a demurrer is sustained and the party has not previously perfected the pleading, the court may allow an amendment upon such terms as may be just.

SEC. 253. Where a demurrer is sustained for the cause mentioned in the seventh subdivision of article 203, the court shall, upon such terms as may be just, on motion to that effect, order the suit to be divided into as many suits as may be necessary to the proper determination of the causes of action stated in the complaint.

SEC. 254. Where a demurrer to a counterclaim is sustained on the ground that the cause of action stated therein is not the proper subject of a counterclaim in that particular suit, the court shall upon such terms as may be just on motion to that effect, order it to be separated from the answer and docketed as a complaint against the plaintiff, to be answered within a time to be fixed by the court. 

SEC. 255. Where a party has leave to amend or to plead, after the decision of a demurrer, the amendment or pleading shall be filed on or before the next day, unless the court order it to be filed sooner, or for cause shown, allow further time. 

SEC. 256. The court must, in furtherance of justice, before or after judgment and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party; or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case; or, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. 

SEC. 257. The court may at any time within five years after judgment and one year after notice thereof, upon such terms as may be just, relieve a party from a judgment, order or other proceeding taken against him, or in a manner prejudicial to his rights, through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission in any proceeding. But such relief shall not impair the title of any purchaser under such judgment. 

Title VI. Provisional remedies.

Chapter I. Attachments.

SECTION 1. Grounds of attachment.

SEC. 258. The plaintiff may, in a suit for the recovery of money at or after the commencement thereof, have an attachment against the property of the defendant in the cases and upon the grounds herein after stated as a security for the satisfaction of such judgment as may be recovered.

2. Against a person who is about to leave the state and reside beyond its limits.
3. When the defendant is about to remove his property, or a material part thereof, out of this state, not leaving enough to satisfy the plaintiff’s claim. 
4. When the defendant so conceals himself, that a citation cannot be served upon him, and a sufficient proof of this shall be the return of the sheriff or other officer, that the said defendant is not to be found in his county.
5. When the defendant has sold or otherwise disposed of his property, or suffered or permitted it to be sold or disposed of, with the fraudulent intent to cheat, hinder or delay his creditors, or is about to sell or otherwise dispose of his property with such intent.

SEC. 259. In either of the cases mentioned in the third and fifth subdivisions of the preceding article, the plaintiff may institute suit and have an attachment against the property of his debtor before the debt is due; but final judgment shall not be rendered against the defendant before the maturity of the debt. 

SECTION 2. How an attachment is obtained.

SEC. 260. A writ of attachment shall be issued by the clerk in every case in the two preceding articles mentioned, when there is filed in his office an affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, stating:

2. That it is just.
3. The amount which the affiant believes the plaintiff ought to recover.
4. The existence in the suit, of some one or more of the grounds for an attachment, mentioned in the two preceding articles. But the affidavit required by this subdivision shall be unnecessary in the case mentioned in subdivision four, of article 258, provided the return of the officer be made as therein prescribed. 

SEC. 261. The writ of attachment shall not issue, until a bond shall be executed, payable to the defendant by one or more sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, in double the amount of the plaintiff’s claim, conditioned the plaintiff shall pay the defendant all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, in case it be decided it was wrongfully obtained.

SEC. 262. When such affidavit and bond are filed, it shall be the duty of the Clerk to issue a writ of attachment, against the property of the debtor, subject to execution, wherever the same may be found, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s claim, the amount of which shall be stated in the writ, and the probably costs of the suit not exceeding fifty dollars.

SEC. 263. Several writs of attachment may, at the option of the plaintiff be issued at the same time or in succession, and sent to different counties. But the costs of one only shall be taxed, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

SECTION 3. Execution and Return of attachment.

SEC. 264 When there are several writs of attachment against the same defendant, they shall be executed in the order in which they are received by the Sheriff.

SEC. 265. The writ of attachment shall be executed without delay, in the following manner:
1. Upon real property, by leaving with the occupant thereof, or if there be no occupant, by posting up in a conspicuous play thereon, a copy of the writ, with a notice thereon, designating the property attached.
2. Upon personal property capable of manual delivery, by taking it into his custody and holding it until replevied or disposed of by the order of the Court or of the Judge.
3. Upon other personal property, by delivering a copy of the writ, with the notice of specifying the property attached, to the person in possession of, or holding the same.

The officer shall deliver copies, to, and cite such persons as garnishees as the plaintiff may direct.

SEC. 266. It shall be the duty of every person mentioned in the fourth subdivision of the preceding Article, to whom the Sheriff may apply therefor, to furnish him with a certificate of the number of shares of the defendant, in the stock of the corporation, or a description of the property held by such corporation or person belonging to or held for the defendant, or the amount of the debt owing to the defendant by such corporation or person, whether due or not; and a failure to perform this duty may be punished by the Court as a contempt. 

SEC. 267. When the property to be attached is a fund in Court, the execution of the writ of attachment shall be by leaving with the Clerk of the Court a copy thereof, with a notice specifying the fund; and where several writs of the attachment are executed upon such fund on the same day, they shall be satisfied out of a ratably.

SEC. 268. The Sheriff in executing a writ of attachment upon personal property, held by the defendant as a part owner with another person, shall not take possession of such property until there has been executed a bond to such other person, by one or more sufficient securities of the plaintiff, to the effect that he shall pay to such person the damages he may sustain by the wrongful suing out the writ, not exceed double the amount of the value of the interest of such person in the property so taken.

SEC. 269. The Sheriff shall return upon every writ of attachment, what he has done under it. The return must show the property attached, the time when it was attached, and the disposition made of it; when garnishees are cited, their names and time at which each was cited, must be stated; and where real property is attached, it shall be described with sufficient certainty to identify it. He shall return with the writ all bonds taken under it.

SECTION 4. Disposition of Attached Property.

SEC. 270. It shall be the duty of the Sheriff to attach, and safely keep any such property of the defendant, until final judgment unless the same be previously replevied.

SEC. 271. The defendant shall have the right to replevy the property at any time within twenty days after it has been attached. But should he fail so to do, the plaintiff shall then have the right to replevy the same.

SEC. 272. Either party replevying shall cause a bond to be executed, payable to the other, with one or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by the Sheriff, in double the amount of the value of the property attached, conditioned for the faithful administration and forthcoming of the property to abide the result of the suit. 

SEC. 273. In all other cases in which the writ of attachment has issued, if the defendant, at any time before judgment, causes a bond ot be executed to the plaintiff by one or more sufficient sureties to be approved by the Sheriff, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of the Court, which shall be rendered in the suit, the attachment shall be discharged, and restitution made of the property taken under it or the proceeds thereof. 

SEC. 274. If the property be not replevied, the Court and in vacation the Judge, shall make proper orders for the preservation and use thereof during the pendency of the suit, and for bringing into Court or securing the debts and funds attached.

SEC. 275. A sale of the property attached, other than real estate or slaves, if the same be not replevied, may be ordered by the Court, or in vacation by the Judge, when by reason of its perishable nature or the cost of keeping it, a sale would be for the benefit or the parties.

SEC. 276. The sale shall be public, after advertisement and shall be made in such manner and upon such credit as the Court or Judge, having regard to the probably duration of the suit, may direct. The Sheriff making such sale, shall take bond with one or more sufficient sureties, for the payment of the purchase money.

SEC. 277. The proceeds when collected by the Sheriff, together with the money received from garnishees shall be held and paid over by him, under the same requirements and responsibilities of himself and his sureties, as are prescribed in respect to money collected under execution.

SEC. 278. The Sheriff shall be allowed by the Court, the necessary expense of keeping the attached property

SEC. 281. The Sheriff may deliver any property attached to the person in whose possession it was found, upon the execution in his presence of a bond to the plaintiff by such person, for a sum equal to double the value of such property, with one or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgement of the Court in the suit, or that the property or its value shall be forthcoming and subject to the order of the Court for the satisfaction of said judgment. In any proceeding on said bond it shall not be defence that the property was not subject to the attachment.

SECTION 5. Of Garnishees.

SEC. 282. Each garnishee summoned shall appear; when he resides in the county in which the suit is pending, the appearance must be in person ; when the garnishee resides in any other than said county, his appearance may be by affidavit made before some officer authorized to take depositions in the county in which the garnishee may reside, disclosing fairly the amount owing by him to the defendant, whether due or not, and the property of the defendant in the possession or under the control of the garnishee; and in case of a corporation, any shares of stock therein held by or for the benefit of the defendant, at or after the service of the writ of attachment.

SEC. 283. When a garnishee, or officer of a corporation summoned as a garnishee, appears in person, he may be examined on oath; and if it appear that at or after the service of the writ upon him, he or the corporation was possessed of any property of the defendant, or was indebted to him, the Court may order the delivery of such property, and the judgment or security for the payment of the amount owing by the garnishee, into the Court, or to such person as it may direct, who shall give bond with security for the same.

SEC. 284. Either the plaintiff or the defendant in the attachment may controvert the answer of a garnishee.

SEC. 285. The plaintiff wishing to controvert said answer, may do so by making the affidavit that he believes the same to be incorrect whereupon if the garnishee or officer cited as a garnishee, resides in the county in which the original suit was instituted, an issue shall be formed under the direction of the Court, and tried as in other suits.—When the plaintiff is absent from the county, and affidavit may be made by his agent or attorney.

SEC. 286. But if the garnishee is a resident of another County, the plaintiff may file a copy of the judgment in the original suit, together with a copy of said controverted answer and oath, in any Court of the county in which the garnishee resides, that has jurisdiction of the amount; whereupon it shall be the duty of the Justice of the Peace or of the Clerk of the Court in whose office such copies are filed, to docket the same as an original suit, and issue citation against the garnishee as in other cases. 

SEC. 287. Upon the return of such citation served an issue shall be formed under the direction of the Court or Justice of the Peace, as the case may be, and tried in like manner as the same might have been tired in the Court of the county in which the original suit was instituted, had the garnishee resided therein.

SEC. 288. When such garnishee or officer shall be duly cited, and shall fail to appear and answer on oath, as required by the provisions of this Chapter, before final judgment shall be rendered against the defendant in the attachment, it shall be lawful for the Court to render as interlocutory judgment by default against the garnishee, or against said corporation for the sum for which judgment has been rendered against the defendant in said attachment.

SEC. 289. After such interlocutory judgment has been rendered, the said garnishee or officer shall be cited to appear on or before the second day of the next term of the Court, and show cause, if any he can, why said judgment shall not be made final. The citation shall contain a copy of the interlocutory judgment, and shall be served as citations in original suits. And if such garnishee or officer shall fail to appear and answer, or show such cause on or before the said second day of said term, such interlocutory judgment shall be made final. 

SEC. 290. The Court may permit the garnishee to retain the property or the amount of wing, upon the execution of a bond with one or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the amount shall be paid, or property shall be forthcoming as the Court may direct. 

SEC. 291. A garnishee may pay the money he owes the defendant to the Sheriff, or he may pay it into the hands of the Court; and he shall be discharged from liability to the defendant for any money so paid, not exceeding the plaintiff’s claim.

SEC. 292. When judgment is rendered against a garnishee it shall be his duty, within ten days thereafter, to pay the money or deliver the effects for which the judgment was rendered, to the officer authorized to receive the same.

SEC. 293. The garnishee shall not be subjected to the costs beyond those caused by the resistance of the claim against him; and if he discloses the property of the defendant in his hands, or the true amount owing by him, and delivers or pays the same according to the order of the Court, he shall be allowed his costs.

SECTION 5. Miscellaneous Provisions respecting attachments

SEC. 294. In any case in which a writ of attachment has been issued because the defendant conceals himself or cannot be found, such writ shall, upon motion, be vacated, and the property released at any time before the trial, where the defendant has by himself or by his attorney, appeared and answered; and not otherwise.

SEC. 295. At any time before the sale of any attached property, or before the payment to the plaintiff of the proceeds thereof or of any attached debts, any person may present his complaint verified by oath, to the Court or to the Judge in vacation, denying that the property was liable to the attachment, and stating a claim to the property or to an interest in or lieu on it, and setting forth the facts upon which such claim is founded.

SECTION 3. Trial by Jury.

SEC. 380.  When the jury have been sworn, the trial shall proceed in the following order, unless the Court, for special reasons, which shall be stated in the record, may otherwise direct: 
1.	The plaintiff must briefly state his claim, and my briefly state the evidence by which he expects to prove it.
2.	The defendant must then briefly state his defence, and may briefly state the evidence he expects to offer in support of it.
3.	The intervener, if there be one, must briefly state his claim, and may briefly state the evidence by which he expects to prove it.
4.	The party plaintiff or defendant on whom rests the burthen of proof in the whole suit, must first produce his evidence; the adverse party will then produce his evidence; after which the intervener, if any will produce his evidence.
5.	The parties will then be confined to rebutting evidence, unless the Court, for reasons in furtherance of justice, permit them to them to other evidence in their original case.
6.	 When the evidence is concluded, either party may request instructions to the jury on points of law, which shall be given or refused.  Such instructions shall be written out by the party, before they are requested; the Judge shall note thereon which are given and which refused, and sign his name thereto; and they shall be filed as part of the record.
7.	The parties may then submit or argue the case to the jury.  In the argument, the party having the burthen of proof, shall have the conclusion, and the adverse party the opening.  If there be more than one speech on either side, or if several defendants having separate defences, appear by different counsel, the Court shall arrange their relative order.
8.	The Court may then instruct the jury, having first reduced the instructions to writing, unless the parties consent that they may be given without writing.  In instructing the jury, the Judge must state to them all matters of law which he thinks necessary for their information in giving their verdict, and shall not instruct nor comment on the weight of evidence.  Such instructions shall be signed by the Judge, and filed.
	A material departure from the foregoing provisions, if objected to at the time and exception be taken, shall be good cause of reversal.

SEC. 381.  Papers read in evidence may be carried by the jury to their retirement; but not where part only of a paper has been read, unless the part which was read be separated from that which was not.  And where instructions asked have been partly given and partly refused, the parts refused cannot be taken out with the parts given.

SEC. 382.  At any time before the jury have rendered their verdict, the Court may, for reasons in furtherance of justice, permit either party to supply an omission in the evidence.

SEC. 383.  Whenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is proper for the jury to have a view of real property which is the subject of litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, such property or place being within the county, it may order them to be conducted in a body under the charge of an officer to the place, which shall be shown to them by some person appointed by the Court for that purpose.  While the jury are thus absent, no person other than the person so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with the trial.  Such view shall be refused, where, owing to the distance to be travelled, or other cause, it would be inconvenient to make it.

SEC. 384.  When the case is finally submitted to the jury, they may decide in Court or retire for deliberation.  If they retire, they must be kept together in some convenient place, under the charge of an officer, until they agree upon a verdict or be discharged by the Court, subject to the discretion of the Court to permit them to separate temporarily at night, and at their meals.  The officer having them under his charge, shall not suffer any communication to be made to them or make any himself, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, unless by order of the Court; and he shall not, before their verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon.

SEC. 385.  If the jury are permitted to separate either during the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admonished by the Court, that it is their day not to converse with, or suffer themselves to be addressed by any other person, on any subject of the trial; and during the trial, the Court may admonish the jury, that it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon, until the cause is finally submitted to them.

SEC. 386.  After the jury have retired for deliberation, if they desire to be informed as to any point of law arising in the case, they may request the officer to conduct them into Court, where the information required, being first reduced to writing, shall be given in the presence of, or after notice to the parties or their council.  And if the jury disagree, as to any part of the testimony, the Court may in the presence of, or after notice to both parties or their counsel, permit the witness to recapitulate the testimony touching such fact; and the Court may instruct them as to the law touching the same, reducing the instruction to writing as in other cases.

SEC. 387.  The jury may be discharged by the Court on account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or calamity requiring their discharge, or by consent of the parties, of after they have been kept together until it satisfactorily appears that there is not probability of their agreeing.

SEC. 388.  Where the jury are discharged during the trial or after the cause is submitted to them, it may be tried again immediately or at a future time, as the Court may direct.

SEC. 389.  When the jury have agreed upon their verdict, they must be conducted into Court, their names called by the Clerk, and the verdict rendered by their foreman.

SEC. 390.  When the verdict is announced, either party may require the jury to be polled, which is done by the Clerk or Court asking each juror if it is his verdict.  If any one answers in the negative, the jury must again be sent out for further deliberation.

SEC. 391.  The verdict shall be written, signed by the foreman, and read by the Clerk to the jury, and the inquiry made whether it is their verdict.  If any juror disagrees, they jury must be sent out again; but if no disagreement is expressed, and neither party requires the jury to be polled, the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged from the case.

SECTION 4. Verdict.

SEC. 392.  The verdict of a jury is either general or special.  A general verdict is that by which they pronounce generally, upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.
	A special verdict is that by which they find the facts only.  It must present the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them; and they must be so presented, as that nothing remains to the Court, but to draw from them conclusions of law.

SEC. 393.  The jury, in their discretion, may render a general or special verdict, but may be required by the Court, in any case in which they render a general verdict, to find specially upon particular questions of fact to be stated in writing.  But such questions shall be substantial abridgements of the material or controlling issues of fact.  This special finding is to be recorded with the verdict.

SEC. 394.  When the special finding of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and the Court may give judgment accordingly.
	After the jury have announced their verdict, they may alter and correct if, before it is received and recorded; and the Court may also send them out again to reconsider their verdict before it is received, if it appear to be a mistaken one.
	When, by the verdict, either party is entitled to recover money of the adverse party, the jury, in their verdict, must assess the amount of recovery.

SEC. 395.  If the jury find a verdict for an amount exceeding the amount claimed by the complaint or answer, the excess may be remitted and judgment rendered accordingly, or the party may submit to a new trial.

SEC. 396.  In suits for the recovery of specific personal property, whenever, by the verdict, there will be a judgment for the recovery or return of the property, the jury must assess the value; and such assessment shall specify the separate value of each article, unless, owing to the nature of the property, such specification would be tedious and inconvenient.

SEC. 397.  The verdict must comprehend the whole issue or issues submitted to the jury.

SEC. 398.  In case of several issues, the jury may find some for the plaintiff and some for the defendant.

SEC. 399.  Where there are several defendants, the jury may find in favor of the plaintiff against some of the defendants, and against the plaintiff in favor of the other defendants.

SEC. 400. In a suit for an injury independent of contract, against several defendants, if the defendants be found jointly guilty, the jury cannot sever the damages; otherwise they may.

SEC. 401.  Where the defendant is in default as to one or more of several causes of action stated in the complaint, the jury must assess the damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover thereon, unless they shall have been previously assessed under Article 444.

SEC. 402.  Where one or more of several defendants are in default, and the jury find a verdict on the issue, for the plaintiff, they shall assess the damages against all the defendants; and if the jury find a verdict on the issue for the defendants, they shall nevertheless assess the damages against those who are in default, unless the answer of one of the defendants be such as shows that the plaintiff could have no cause of action against any of them.  This Article does not apply where the damages have been assessed under Article 444.

SECTION 5. Trial by the Court.

SEC. 403.  The trial by jury may be waived by the parties in suits arising on contract, and, with the assent of the Court, in other suits, in the following manner:
1.	By failing to appear at the trial
2.	By written consent in person, or by attorney, filed with the Clerk
3.	By oral consent in open Court, entered on the record.  

SEC. 404.  Upon trial of issues of fact by the Court, it shall not be necessary for the Court to state its finding, except generally for the plaintiff or defendant, unless one of the parties request it, with a view of excepting to the decision of the Court upon questions of law involved in the trial; in which case the Court shall state in writing the conclusions of fact found, separately from the conclusions of law.

SEC. 405.  The provisions of this Title, respecting trials by jury, apply, so far as they are in their nature applicable to trials by the Court.

SECTION 6. Trial by Referees.

SEC. 406.  All, or any of the issue in the suit whether of law or fact, or both, may be referred, upon the written consent of the parties.

SEC. 407. In all cases of reference, the parties may agree upon a suitable person or persons, not exceeding three, being an odd number, and the reference shall be ordered accordingly; and if the parties do not agree, the Court shall appoint the referee or referees, who shall be free from exception.

 SEC. 408.  The Clerk of the Court or other officer authorised to administer an oath, shall administer to the referee or referees an oath, fairly and impartially to try the issues referred to them; such oath shall be in writing, signed by the referee or referees, and shall be attached to the copy of the order for their appointment.

SEC. 409.  The trial by referees is conducted in the same manner as a trial by the Court.  They have the same power to grant adjustments as the Court, upon such trial.  If required, they must state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately, and their decision must be given and may be expected to and reviewed in like manner.  The report of the referees upon the whole issue, stands as the decision of the Court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the suit had been tried by the Court.  When the reference is to report the facts, the report has the effect of a special verdict.

SEC. 410. Subpoenas for witnesses shall be issued by the Clerk, and if a subpoena be disobeyed, the fact shall be reported to the Court by the referees, and the witness shall be punished for contempt of Court, and be liable to the party injured, as in other cases.

SEC. 411.  The order of reference may be made by the Judge in vacation, with the written consent of the parties; the consent and order being filed with the papers.

SEC. 412.  Oaths to the witnesses shall be administered by the Clerk of the Court, or some other officer competent to administer the same.

SEC. 413.  The Court may allow proper compensation to the referees, which shall be taxed as part of the costs of the suit.

SECTION 7. Auditors

SEC. 414.  Whenever it shall appear to the Court that an investigation of accounts or examination of vouchers is necessary, for the purposes of justice between the parties, the Court shall appoint an auditor or auditors to state the account between the parties and to make report so made shall, under the direction of the Court, be given in evidence to the jury, subject, however, in trials by a jury or by the Court, to be impeached by evidence from either party.  And the Court shall award reasonable compensation to such auditors, which shall be allowed and taxed in the bill of costs, to be recovered as in others cases.

SEC. 415.  The report of the auditor shall be verified by his affidavit, stating that be has examined carefully the state of the account between the parties, and that his report contains a true statement thereof, so far as the same has come to his knowledge.

SECTION 8. Exceptions.

SEC. 416.  An exception is an objection taken to a decision of the Court upon a matter of law.

SEC. 417.  The party objecting to the decision is made, but time may be given to reduce the exception to writing; but not beyond the term, unless by special leave entered of record.

SEC. 418.  No particular form of exception is required.  The objection must be stated, with so much of the evidence as is necessary to explain it and no more, and the whole as briefly as possible.

SEC. 419.  It shall not be necessary to copy a written instrument or any documentary evidence, or deposition, into a bill of exceptions; but it shall be sufficient to refer to such evidence, if its appropriate place be designated by the words “here insert.”

SEC. 420.  Where the decision objected to is entered on the record, the exception may be taken by the party causing to be noted, at the end of the decision, that he excepts.

Aut. 421.  The ruling of the Court, in giving, refusing, or qualifying instructions to the jury, shall be regarded as excepted to in all cases.

SEC. 422.  Where the decision is not entered on the record, the party excepting must reduce his exception to writing, and present it to the Judge for his allowance and signature.  If true, it shall be the duty of the Judge to allow and sign it; whereupon it shall be filed with the pleadings, as part of the record, but not spread at large on the minutes.  If the writing is not true, the Judge shall suggest the correction to be made and sign it.  If the party excepting is not satisfied with the correction, upon his procuring the signatures of two by-standers attesting the truth of his exception as by him prepared, in the particular points disputed, the same shall be filed as part of the record; but the truth of the exceptions may be controverted and maintained by affidavits, not exceeding five in number on each side, to be filed with the Clerk within ten days after the filing of the exception.

Chapter III.  New Trial.

SEC. 423.  A new trial is a re examination in the same Court of an issue of fact, after a verdict by a jury, report of referee or referees, or a decision by the Court.  The former verdict, report, or decision, may be vacated and a new trial granted, on the application of the party aggrieved, for any of the following causes affecting materially the substantial rights of such party:
1.	Irregularity in the proceedings of the Court, jury or prevailing party, or any order of Court, or abuse of discretion, by which the party was prevented from having a fair trial.
2.	Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party.
3.	Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.
4.	Excessive damages, or damages manifestly too small, appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.
5.	Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery, whether too large or too small, where the suit is upon a contract, or for the injury or detention of property.
6.	That the verdict or decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence, or is contrary to law.
7.	Newly discovered evidence material for the party applying, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial.
8.	Error of law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the party making the application.

SEC. 424.  Not more than two new trials shall be granted to either party, unless the jury have been guilty of some misconduct, or erred in matter of law.

SEC. 425.  The application for a new trial must be made at the term the verdict or decision is rendered, and except for the cause mentioned in sub-division seven of Article 423 shall be made within three days after the verdict or decision was rendered, unless unavoidably prevented; and when so made shall be decided at same term, or stand discharged.

SEC. 426.  The application must be by motion, upon written grounds filed at the time of making the motion the grounds mentioned in the second, third, and seventh subdivisions of Article 423 must be sustained by affidavits showing their truth, and may be controverted by affidavits.

SEC. 427.  Where grounds for a new trial are discovered after the term at which the verdict or decision was rendered, the application may be made by a complaint field with the Clerk not later than the second term after the discovery, on which a citation shall issue, as on other complaints, requiring the adverse party to appear and answer it on or before the next term.  The application shall stand for hearing at the term to which the citation is returned executed, and shall be summarily decided by the Court.  The evidence may be either by depositions or by witnesses examined in Court.  But no such application shall be made more than two years after the final judgment was rendered.


Chapter IV. Judgment.

SECTION 1. Judgment in General.

SEC. 428.  A judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in a suit; but, where there are several plaintiffs or defendants, such judgment may be final as to one party and not as to the others.  An interlocutory judgment is the determination of an application to grant or set aside a provisional remedy, or other determination of the rights of the parties, which by its terms shows that it is not final.

SEC. 429.  A suit may be dismissed without prejudice to either party:
1.	By the plaintiff, before the final submission of the case to the jury, or to the Court where the trial is by the Court.
2.	By the Court, where the plaintiff fails to appear on the trial; or,
3.	Fails to make the necessary parties, after having been ordered by the Court; or
4.	On the application of some of the defendants, where there are other necessary parties whom the plaintiff fails to prosecute with diligence; or,
5.	For disobedience by the plaintiff, after due warning, of an order concerning the proceedings in the suit, 
	In all other cases, upon the trial of the suit, the decision must be upon the merits.

SEC. 430.  In any case where a counterclaim has been presented, the defendant shall have the right of proceeding to the trial of his claim, although the plaintiff may have dismissed his suit or failed to appear.

SEC. 431.  Judgment may be given for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several defendants; and it may determine the rights of the parties on each side, as between themselves; and it may grant to the defendant any affirmative relief to which he may be entitled.  But the main judgment, as between the plaintiffs and defendants, shall not be embarrassed or delayed by the proceedings to determine the rights of the parties on either side, as between themselves.

SEC. 432.  In a suit against several defendants, the Court may render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the suit to proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment may be proper.

SEC. 433.  In a suit to recover the possession of personal property, the judgment for the plaintiff may be for the delivery of the property, or the value thereof, in case a delivery cannot be had, and damages for the detention.  Where the property has been delivered to the plaintiff, and a return thereof is claimed, judgment may be for the return of the property, or its value in case a return cannot be had, and damages for the taking and withholding of the property.

SEC. 434.  Where the party against whom judgment is rendered, shall have given a bond at the commencement or during the progress of the suit, with sureties, for a provisional remedy or other purpose incidental to the suit, the judgment shall include the sureties in a form consistent with the tenor of the bond.

SEC. 435.  Where the judgment is for the conveyance of real estate, or the delivery of personal property, the judgment may pass the title of such property, without any act to be done on the part of the party against whom the judgment is rendered.

SEC. 436.  When judgment is given against executors or administrators for the recovery of money due from, or damages incurred by their testator or intestate, or for the foreclosure of a mortgage or enforcement of other lien, such judgment shall state that it is to be paid in due course of administration; and no execution or order of sale shall issue in such judgment.

SEC. 437.  Judgments for the enforcement of specific liens, against persons other than executors or administrators, shall be that the plaintiff recover his debt, damages and costs, and that an order of sale issue to the Sheriff of the county where the property, or any part thereof, can be found, directing him to sell the same if found, as under execution; and if the proceeds of such sale or sales be insufficient to pay the judgment, or it the property cannot be found, further execution may be issued for such balance, or for the debt, against such defendant, as the case may be.

SEC. 438.  The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, cannot exceed, or vary substantially from that which he shall have demanded in his complaint; but in any other case, the Court may grant him any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint, and embraced within the issue.  Where there is a defect in the demand for relief, and the defendant has not appeared, the plaintiff may amend, and cite the defendant anew.

SEC. 439.  The Clerk, immediately after the adjournment of the Court, shall attach together and file the following papers, which shall constitute the judgment roll:
1.	In case the complaint be not answered by any defendant, the citation and complaint, proof of service, the verdict or report and statement of the facts, if any, and a copy of the judgment.
2.	In all other cases, the citation, pleadings, and a copy of the judgment, with any verdict or report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions, statement of facts, if any, and all orders and papers in any way involving the merits, and necessarily affecting the judgment.

SECTION 2.  Judgment where all the Defendants are not cited.

SEC. 440.  Where the suit is against two or more defendants, and the citation is served on more or more, but not on all of them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows:
1.	If the suit be against defendants jointly indebted upon contract, he may proceed against the defendant served unless the Court otherwise direct, and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only that it may be enforced against the joint property of all, and the separate property of the defendants served; or,
2.	If the suit be against defendants severally liable, he may proceed against the defendants served in the same manner as if they were the only defendants named; and my afterwards proceed in the same suit against those not served.
3.	This Article shall not authorise the entry of judgment against an indorser, surety, or guarantor, liable as such only, unless judgment shall have been or shall at the same time be entered against the principal who is jointly sued, except in cases where the principal resides beyond the limits of the State, or is dead, or insolvent, or a transient person beyond the limits of the county.

SEC. 441.  When a judgment shall be recovered against one or more of several persons jointly indebted upon contract, as provided in the foregoing Article, those who were not originally cited to answer the complaint, may be cited to show cause why they should not be bound by the judgment, in the same manner as if they had been originally cited.

SECTION 3. Judgment upon Failure to Answer.

SEC. 442.  Where the defendant fails to file his answer within the time prescribed by law, or to obtain an enlargement of the time for answering, he shall be deemed to be in default, and the plaintiff may take judgment at any time.

SEC. 443.  Where a defendant is in default he cannot demur or answer, without leave of the Court first had, on motion for that purpose; and a demurrer or answer so filed, without leave, may be treated as a nullity.

SEC. 444.  Where there has been personal service of the citation, or the defendant has appeared, and the defendant is in default, judgment may be had as follows:
1.	In any suit arising purely on contract, in writing, for an amount ascertainable by calculation, the Clerk shall enter judgment for such amount against the defendant of defendants, or against one or more of several defendants.
2.	In other suits, the plaintiff may apply to the Court for the relief demanded in the complaint.  If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact be necessary to enable the Court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the Court may take the account or hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that purpose.  And where the suit is for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages for the withholding thereof, the Court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury, or if the examination of a long account be involved, by a reference as above provided.  The defendant, notwithstanding his default, may appear and assist the Court and jury or referees, in ascertaining the proper judgment, assessment or computation.

SEC. 445.  Where there has been personal service of the citation, or an appearance, and the defendant is in default, whether judgment has been entered or not, the defendant may, on motion at the same term of the Court, be permitted to make a defence on the following terms:
1.	The defendant, his agent or attorney, shall make affidavit that he is advised and verily believes that he has a good and substantial ground of defence to the whole suit, or to part thereof, stating such part.
2.	The defendant shall pay all costs previously incurred.

SEC. 446.  Where service is made by publication and no appearance is entered within the time allowed for pleading, the Court shall appoint an attorney to defend the suit; but the rights of the absent defendant cannot be prejudiced by the acts of an attorney so appointed.

SEC. 447.  In suits where the service of the citation was by publication, and the defendant has not appeared, the plaintiff may, at the second term of the Court, apply for the relief demanded in the complaint, and the Court must thereupon require proof to be made of the demand or material facts mentioned in the complaint, and must require the plaintiff, or his agent, where the suit is for the recovery of money, to be examined on oath respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any one for his use, on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover.  But where the plaintiff files with the petition his own affidavit, stating that any of the allegations thereof recited in the affidavit are true, and known to be so by the defendant, and that they cannot be proved or shown otherwise than by his testimony so far as affiant knows or believes, such allegations unless denied by the answer, shall be taken as true.  Before rendering judgment, the Court shall require the plaintiff to cause to be filed satisfactory security, to abide the order of the Court, touching the restitution of any estate or effect which may be directed by such judgment to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money that may be collected under, or by virtue of such judgment, in case the defendant or his representative shall apply and be admitted to defend the suit, and shall succeed in such defence.

SEC. 448.  Where the citation shall have been served by publication only, except in suits for divorce, the defendant or his representatives may, upon good cause shown, be allowed to defend after judgment, at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within five years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just; and if the defence be successful, and the judgment or any part thereof, shall have been collected, or otherwise enforced, such restitution shall thereupon be compelled, as the Court may direct; but the title to property sold under such judgment, to a purchaser in good faith, other than the plaintiff in the judgment, or his attorney, shall not be thereby affected.  The exception in this Article as to suits for divorce applies to the issue of divorce only, and not to any issues as to the division or right of property, or custody of children.

SEC. 449.  On the rendition of judgment in a suit wherein service of the citation was by publication only, where there has been no appearance by the defendant, a statement of the facts on which the judgment is rendered shall be incorporated with the record.

SEC. 450.  Where, in a suit against the owners of a steamboat or other vessel without naming them, under Article 73, there is no answer filed, the statements of the complaint are not to be taken as true, but are to be established by proof on the trial, as in Article 447.

SECTION 4. Judgment by Confession.

SEC. 451.  Any person indebted or against whom a cause of action exits, may appear, in person or by attorney, in Court, and confess judgment therefor; whereupon judgment shall be entered accordingly, provided that the debtor, or person against whom the cause of action exists, shall first file with the Clerk a statement signed by him and verified by his oath, to the following effect:
1.	It must state the amount for which judgment may be entered, and authorize the entry of judgment therefor.  
2.	It must state concisely the facts out of which the cause of action arose, and must show that the sum confessed therefor is justly due.
3.	It must state that the judgment is not confessed for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding the affiant’s creditors.	
	Such statement shall be made a part of the entry of judgment.

SEC. 452.  Where the judgment is confessed by attorney, the power of attorney shall be filed, and shall be made a part of the entry of judgment.

SEC. 453.  A confession of judgment is a waiver of errors.

SEC. 454.  Such judgment shall have the same effect and authorize the same proceedings as judgments rendered in suits regularly brought and prosecuted.

SECTION 5. Judgments on agreed Cases.

SEC. 455.  Parties may in all cases, either with or without process, by an agreement to that effect, submit any matter of controversy between them to the Court, upon an agreed statement of facts to be made out and signed by the parties; but it must appear by affidavit that the controversy is real and the proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights of the parties; whereupon the Court shall proceed to try the same and render judgment as in other cases.

SEC. 456.  The statement of the case, the submission, and the judgment, shall constitute the record.

SEC. 457.  The judgment may be enforced in the same manner as if it had been rendered in, suit, and, in like manner, shall be with costs, subject to an appeal or writ of error, unless otherwise provided in the submission.

SECTION 6. Docketing and Lien of Judgment.

SEC. 458.  The Clerk shall keep a book to be called “the judgment docket,” in which he shall docket all the judgments, in whole or in part, for the recovery of money, other than judgments for costs alone, within twenty days after each term of the Court, in the order in which they were rendered.  The date of the rendition of each judgment shall be stated in such entries, or at the end thereof.

SEC. 459.  The Clerk shall also keep an index to the judgment docket; and, where a judgment is against several persons, it shall be indexed in the name of each person.

SEC. 460.  Every Clerk who shall fail to keep a judgment docket, or index thereto, or who shall fail to docket any judgment and properly index the same, shall be liable to any person injured, for the amount of damages sustained by such failure, to be recovered in a suit against the Clerk alone, or upon his official bond, against him and his sureties.

SEC. 461.  The judgment docket and index thereto, shall be a record, and open, and subject to examination as other records.

SEC. 462.  Sufficient space shall be left for the entry of credits, and satisfaction, at the foot of each judgment in the judgment docket, and it shall be the duty of each Clerk to enter such credits and satisfaction, whenever the same appear by return of execution or other paper on file in his office.  And whenever it shall appear to the Court on motion, after notice to the party or his attorney of record, that credits or satisfaction ought to be entered, the Court shall order it to be done accordingly.

SEC. 463.  A judgment in whole or in part for the recovery of money, shall, for five years after its rendition, be a lien on all the real property situated in the county, which the person against whom it is rendered, may then own by title legal or equitable, or may acquire within said period.  But whenever an appeal from any judgment shall be pending, and the bond requisite to stay execution on such judgment shall have been given, and the appeal perfected as provided by law, the Court in which such judgment was recovered may, on special motion, unless there be a stipulation to the contrary in the appeal bond, after notice to the person owning the judgment, or to his attorney of record, direct an entry to be made by the Clerk on the docket of said judgment, that the same is “secured on appeal;” and thereupon it shall cease, during the pendency of the appeal, to be a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor, as against purchasers and mortgages in good faith.

SEC. 464.  Judgments on bonds and recognizances taken in criminal cases, shall bind the real estate of the debtor from the date of the first judgment of forfeiture.

SEC. 465.  If a motion for leave to issue execution be made within five years from the date of the judgment, and the motion be afterwards sustained, the original lien shall continue; but third persons shall not be affected thereby, between the time of the expiration of the five years, and the docketing of the judgment on the motion, unless a note of the motion be made on the margin, or at the foot of the judgment in a judgment docket.  The Clerk in making such note shall state the date of making the same.

SEC. 466.  When such motion is made the Clerk shall make a note thereof on the margin, or at the foot of the judgment, on the judgment docket.

SEC. 467.  Where a judgment debtor dies, the lien of the judgment extends beyond the five years, until on year after the final close of the administration, or sale of the property in due course thereof.

SECTION 7. Proceedings to Reverse, Vacate, or Modify Judgments.

SEC. 468.  A judgment of the District Court may be reversed, vacated or modified either by the Supreme Court, of by the Court in which the judgment was rendered.

SEC. 469.  A judgment may be reversed or modified by the Supreme Court, for errors appearing in the record, whether of law or fact.  This includes the interlocutory judgments mentioned in subdivision three of Article 13.

SEC. 470.  The proceedings to obtain such reversal or modification shall be by appeal prosecuted as prescribed by law.

SEC. 471.  A misprison of the Clerk shall not be a ground for an appeal or writ of error, until the same has been presented and acted upon in the District Court.

SEC. 472.  The Court in which judgment has been rendered shall have power, after the expiration of the term to vacate or modify such judgment, 
1.	By granting a new trial for the cause and in the manner prescribed in Article 423.
2.	By a new trial granted in proceedings against defendants cited by publication, as prescribed in Article 448.
3.	For misprisons on the Clerk.
4.	For fraud practised by the successful party.
5.	For erroneons proceedings against an infant or person of unsound mind, where the condition of such defendant does not appear on the record, nor the error in the proceedings.
6.	For the death of one of the parties before the verdict, of if not a trial by jury, before judgment.
7.	For unavoidable casualty preventing the party from appearing or defending.
8.	In cases contemplated by Article 257.

SEC. 473.  The proceeding to correct misprisons of the Clerk, shall be by motion upon reasonable notice, to the adverse party, or his attorney in the suit.

SEC. 474.  The proceeding to vacate or modify the judgment on the grounds mentioned in subdivisions two, four, five, six, seven and eight of Article 472, shall be complaint on oath, setting forth the judgment, the grounds to vacate or modify it, and the defence to the suit, if the party applying was defendant.  On the complaint, a citation shall issue and be served, and proceedings had as in other cases.

SEC. 475.  A judgment shall not be vacated until it is adjudged that there is a valid defense to the suit in which the judgment is rendered, or if the plaintiff seeks its vacation, that there is a valid cause of action; and where a judgment is modified, all liens and securities obtained under it, shall be preserved to the modified judgment.

SEC. 476.  The Court must first try and decide upon the grounds to vacate or modify a judgment, before trying or deciding upon the validity of the defence or cause of action.

SEC. 477.  The party seeking to vacate or modify a judgment may obtain an injunction suspending proceedings on the whole or part thereof, upon its being rendered probably by affidavit of by exhibition of the record, that the party is entitled to have such judgment vacated or modified.

SEC. 478.  Where a judgment is vacated or reversed and the same, or any part thereof, shall have been collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution shall thereupon be compelled as the law may direct; but the title to property sold under such judgment, to a purchaser in good faith, other than the plaintiff in the judgment or his attorney shall not be thereby affected.

SEC. 479.  After the trial of any cause when a party intends to appeal, he may make out of statement of the facts given in evidence on the trial of the cause, and submit the same to the opposite party or his attorney, for his inspection, during the term; and if the parties or their attorneys agree as to the facts given in evidence, they shall sign the same, and file it as part of the record.

SEC. 480. But if, on inspection of such statement, the parties cannot agree, they shall submit their respective statements to the Judge presiding at the trial, who, from the statements as furnished him, and his own knowledge, shall, during the term at which the trial was had, make out a correct statement of such facts, and sign the same, and cause it to be filed as part of the record.

SEC. 481.  When a party intends to appeal he may make a suggestion of the fact in open court, during the term; and such suggestion shall be entered of record, and shall be sufficient notice of the appeal, provided that an appeal bond be filed within twenty days after the expiration of the term of the Court as fixed by law.

SEC. 482. Every direction of a Court or Judge, entered upon the minute book or made in writing, in a suit, and not included in a judgment, is denominated an order.  An order is sometimes called an interlocutory judgment.

SEC. 483.  An application for an order is a motion.

SEC. 484.  There shall be a motion docket, wherein the Clerk shall enter all motions filed; the number of the suit, where the motion relates to a suit pending; the names of the parties, and their attorneys, and a brief statement of the nature of the motion.

SEC. 485.  Where it is not otherwise specially provided, one day’s notice of every motion shall be given to the adverse party or his attorney.  An entry of the motion in the motion docket within two days after judgment, is sufficient notice of a motion for a new trial.

SEC. 486.  Whenever in the commencement or progress of a suit, it is necessary or permitted to serve a notice, such notice may be served, either by an officer authorized by law to serve original process of the Court in which the suit is pending, or by any person who is not a party to, or interested in the suit.

SEC. 487.  Every such notice may be served in the same manner as a citation, on the party or his attorney of record, except as provided in Article 489; and the return of such notice, when made by an officer, or when made by any other person and verified by the affidavit of such person, shall be received as evidence of the facts therein stated, subject however, to be repelled by contrary proof.

SEC. 488.  Where a party has no known place of abode in this State, and no attorney in the county where the suit is pending, or where the parties, plaintiffs or defendants, are numerous, the Court may direct the mode of serving notices, and to what persons they shall be given.

SEC. 489.  Where a party has an attorney of record, in the suit, the service of papers must be made on the attorney, instead of the party.

SEC. 490. It shall be the duty of the Sheriff, where a notice is delivered to him for service within his county, to serve and return such notice to the party who delivered it to him.  A failure to perform this duty may be punished as a disobedience of the process of the Court.

SEC. 491.  The attorney of record continues to be the attorney of the party for the purpose of receiving notice, until the adverse party has been notified that he has retired from the case or been discharged.

Title IX.  Of the Costs.

SEC. 492.  Each party shall be responsible to the officers of the Court for the costs incurred by him.

SEC. 493.  Any person who shall file with the  Clerk an affidavit in writing that he is unable to pay costs, shall be permitted to prosecute or defend any suit or proceeding, free of costs.

SEC. 494.  No security for costs shall be required from the State; nor from executors, administrators or guardians in any suit to recover money due, or property belonging to the estate they represent.

SEC. 495.  Except in cases named in the two preceding Articles, the plaintiff in any suit or proceeding, on motion of the defendant, or any officer of the Court interested in the costs, may be ordered to give security for the payment of all the costs, which have accrued or may accrue in the suit, in the Court where it is then pending, provided that he motion be filed one day before the cause is called for trial; and if he fails to comply with such order on or before the first day of the next term of the Court, or make the affidavit provided for by article 493, the suit shall be dismissed.

SEC. 496.  Like security may be required of an intervener, for the payment of all costs which have accrued or which may accrue in that Court by reason of his claim or intervention.  Such security may also be required by the plaintiff; and if the intervener fail to comply with such an order before the trial of the suit commences, or make the affidavit provided for in Article 493, the claim in intervention shall be dismissed.  But further time may be allowed where the trial is afterwards postponed.

SEC. 497.  An order for security for costs shall not delay the suit, if the defendant will give the security; nor, where the order is obtained by the defendant, if it declare that the suit shall not be delayed thereby.

SEC. 498.  Security for costs may be given by the acknowledgement of one surety, to be approved by the Clerk, in open Court, or by an obligation of such surety filed with the Clerk.  Such acknowledgement or obligation shall be deemed to be a judgment, on which execution may issue for costs, properly taxable against the principal, at any time after the termination of the suit in that Court.

SEC. 499.  Additional security for costs may be required where it is made to appear to the Court that the former security is insufficient.

SEC. 500.  Where a plaintiff shall commence in the same Court, several suits against the same defendant or defendants, for causes of action that might have been joined, he shall recover his costs, in one of such suits only, if objection be made, unless sufficient reasons be shown to the Court for commencing several suits.

SEC. 501.  In suits for the injuries mentioned in Article 22, if the jury find a verdict for damages less than twenty-dollars, each party shall pay his own costs.

SEC. 502.  Where a defendant recovers judgment on a counterclaim which he obtained by assignment after the commencement of the suit the plaintiff shall recover his costs, unless the defendant would have had judgment without pleading such counterclaim.

SEC. 503.  The defendant shall recover the costs of the suit, 
1.	Where the claim of the plaintiff has been reduced by payment, to less than one hundred dollars.
2.	Where, in cases not included in Article 22, the judgment is for less than one hundred dollars, and has not been reduced below that amount by a counterclaim.

SEC. 504.  The defendant in a suit for the recovery of money only, may, at any time before the trial, serve upon the plaintiff or his attorney an offer in writing, to allow judgment to be taken against him for the sum specified therein.  If the plaintiff accept the offer, and give notice thereof to the defendant or his attorney within five days after the offer was served, the offer and an affidavit that the notice of acceptance was delivered in the time limited, may be filed by the plaintiff, or the defendant may file the acceptance, with a copy of the offer verified by affidavit; and, in either case, the offer and acceptance shall be noted on the record, and judgment shall be entered accordingly.  If the notice of acceptance be not given in the period limited, the offer shall be deemed withdrawn, and shall not be given in evidence or mentioned on the trial.  If the plaintiff fail to obtain judgment for more than was offered by the defendant, he shall pay his own and the defendant’s costs from the time of the offer.

SEC. 505.  In a suit for the recovery of money only, the defendant having answered, may serve upon the plaintiff or his attorney, an offer in writing, that, if he fail in his defence, the amount of the recovery shall be assessed at a specified sum.  If the plaintiff accept the offer and give notice thereof to the defendant or his attorney within five days after it is served, and the defendant fail in his defence, the judgment shall be for the amount so agreed upon.  If the plaintiff do not accept the offer, he shall prove the amount to be recovered, as if the offer had not been made; the offer shall not be given in evidence or mentioned on the trial; and if the amount recovered by the plaintiff do not exceed the sum mentioned in the offer, the defendant shall recover his costs incurred in the defence in respect to the question of amount, to be taxed under the direction of the Court.

SEC. 506.  The making of any offer pursuant to the provisions of either of the two preceding Articles, shall not be a cause for a continuance of a suit or postponement of a trial.

SEC. 507.  Where there are several defendants not united in interest, and making separate answers, and the plaintiff fails to recover judgment against all, the Court may award costs to such of the defendants as have judgment in their favor, or any of them.

SEC. 508.  On motions the Court may allow or refuse costs to the party prevailing.

SEC. 509.  On all issues of law the party prevailing shall recover his costs.

SEC. 510.  Where a new trial is granted, the costs shall abide the even of the suit unless otherwise directed by the Court, at the time the new trial is granted.

SEC. 511.  The party in whose favor the final judgment is rendered, shall recover costs, except in cases where it may be otherwise expressly provided by law, or directed by the Court, subject to appeal or writ of error.

SEC. 512.  The costs shall be taxed by the Clerk, subject to revision by the Court on motion.

SEC. 513.  All taxes and fees imposed on suits shall be included in the bill of costs.

SEC. 514.  There shall not be allowed in the bill of costs, the fees of more than two witnesses to the same fact.

Title X.  Suits in Particular Cases.

Chapter 1. To recover the possession of real property, and to determine conflicting claims thereto.

SECTION 1.  In General.

SEC. 515.  The plaintiff in a suit to recover the possession of real property or to determine conflicting claims to such property, shall, in his complaint particularly describe the premises, so as to distinguish the same from other like property in the vicinity, and state the particulars of his title, and that the defendant is unlawfully in possession of the premises, of that he claims to have a title thereto.

SEC. 516.  Where a suit is commenced against a tenant in possession, the landlord may enter himself, as a defendant, and shall be entitled to make such defence as if he had been the original defendant.

SEC. 517.  The defendant in his answer, in addition to the matters enumerated in Article 203, where the same are not apparent on the face of the complaint, 
1.	May deny that he is in possession of the premises described in the complaint; or
2.	May deny that he claims to have any title to the premises; or
3.	May deny that the plaintiff hath good title to the premises, or to part thereof; or
4.	May claim title to the premises or to part thereof, or to the possession thereof, stating the particulars of his title or claim; or
5.	Where the defendant is in possession by himself or tenant, he may allege that the title to the premises or to part thereof of which he is in possession, is in a third person, stating the particulars of such title.

SEC. 518.  Where the defendant denies that he claims to have any title to the premises described in the complaint, and he is not alleged to be in possession thereof, the controversy becomes a question of costs simply, and the plaintiff may proceed or discontinue the suit at his option; but in either event, the effect as to the title, shall be that of a recovery by the plaintiff.

SEC. 519.  In a suit by a tenant in common of real property, against his co-tenant, if the defendant admit the right of the plaintiff as alleged in the complaint, the controversy shall become a question of costs merely, and shall depend on whether the defendant had denied the right of the plaintiff, or did some act amounting to such denial, of which the plaintiff had information at the times of commencing the suit.

SEC. 520.  The plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title; but where both parties claim under the same person, the party who exhibits the better title shall recover, unless the other party, being plaintiff, show a paramount title in himself, or being defendant, show a paramount title in himself or another.

SEC. 521.  Where the defendant has claimed too much, or misdescribed the part which he intended to claim, he may amend at any time before jury retire; but if the plaintiff will admit the defence, after such amendment is made, the defendant shall pay all costs incurred after the answer was filed.

SEC. 522.  Where the defendant claims part of the premises only, the answer is equivalent to a disclaimer of the balance.

SEC. 523.  Where the defendant claims the whole premises, and the plaintiff shows himself entitled to recover part, he shall recover such part and costs.

SEC. 524.  Either party shall have the right to go upon the land for the purpose of making a survey thereof; and if either party hinder or prevent the other by force or threats, he may be proceeded against as for a contempt of Court.

SEC. 525.  If the interest of the plaintiff expire before the time at which he could be put in possession, he shall obtain a judgment for damages only.

SEC. 526.  Where there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants, any one or more of the plaintiffs may recover against one or more of the defendants, the premises or any part thereof, or any interest therein, or damages according to the right of the parties.

SEC. 527.  Where it is alleged and proved that one of the parties is in possession of the premises, the jury, if they find for the adverse party, shall assess the damages for the mesne profits; and if special injury to the property be alleged and proved, the jury shall assess the damages accordingly.  But such assessment shall not be made, where the party in possession has availed himself of the law for the benefit of claimants in good faith.

SEC. 528.  Where one party in a suit of this nature, is entitled to damages for withholding or useing or injuring his property, the adverse party may set off the value of any permanent improvements madet here on by him or those under whom he claims, to the extent of such damages, unless he proposes to avail himself of the law for the benefit of claimants in good faith.

SEC. 529.  The Court rendering the judgment, upon the application of the party against whom judgment is rendered, his heirs or assigns or representatives, filed within one year after the judgment, and upon the payment of all costs, and of the damages if the Court so direct, shall vacate the judgment and grant a new trial.  But one new trial can be granted without cause.

SEC. 530.  After a new trial granted to the plaintiff without cause, if the suit be dismissed, or the plaintiff take a non-suit, the defendant shall have a judgment in his favor for the land in controversy.

SEC. 531.  If the application for a new trial be made after the close of the term at which the judgment was rendered, the party applying shall give the adverse party, or his attorney of record, ten days notice thereof, before the first day of the next term after the application is made.

SEC. 532.  The result of the new trial, if application therefor be made after the close of the term at which the judgment was rendered, shall in no case affect the interest of third persons, acquired in good faith, for a valuable consideration, since the former trial, and before the application for a new trial.

SEC. 533.  But the party who, on such new trial, shows himself entitled to lands which have thus passed to the hands of a purchaser, may recover the proper amount of damages against the other party, either in the same or in a subsequent suit.  But such party shall not be required to prove that the purchase was made in good faith.

SECTION 2.  Claimants in good faith.

SEC. 534.  In any suit to recover the possession of real property or to determine conflicting claims thereto, either party may allege in his pleadings, that he and those persons under whom he claims, have had adverse possession in good faith, of the property in controversy, for at least one year next before the commencement of such suit; and that he and those persons under whom he claims, have made permanent and valuable improvements on the lands sued for, during the time he or they have had such possession of the same, stating the improvements and their value respectively; and stating also the grounds of his or their claim.

SEC. 535.  If the party who makes such allegation, be found by the Court or jury not to be the rightful owner of the property, the issues joined on such allegation shall thereupon be tried as in other cases, and the Court or jury shall assess:
1.	The present value of all permanent improvements made as aforesaid, previous to the commencement of the suit; 
2.	The damages, if any, which the premises may have sustained by waste or cultivation, to the time of rendering judgment;
3.	The fair value of the use and occupation of the premises, without the improvements made as aforesaid; and
4.	The value of the estate which the successful party has in the premises, without the improvements made as aforesaid.
	If the trial be by jury, the above issues shall be tried by the same jury, which tried the main issue, unless prevented by accident or other unavoidable cause.

SEC. 536.  If the value of the use and occupation, and the damages exceed the value of the improvements, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the successful party for the excess.

SEC. 537.  If the value of the use and occupation, and the damages do not equal the value of the improvements, the successful party may pay the value of the improvements, deducting the value of the use and occupation and the damages sustained, and take the property.

SEC. 538.  Should he fail to do so, after a reasonable time, to be fixed by the Court, the adverse party may take the property upon paying the assessed value of the land aside from the improvements.

SEC. 539.  If this be not done within a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, the parties will be held to be tenants in common of all the lands, including the improvements, each holding an interest proportionate to the value of his property, as ascertained by the assessment aforesaid.

SEC. 540.  A purchaser at any judicial or tax sale, made by the proper person or officer, is a claimant in good faith, within the meaning of this Section, whether such person or officer had sufficient authority to sell or not, unless the want of authority was known to the purchaser at the time of the sale, or at the time of making the improvements.  And the rights of such purchaser shall pass to his assignees or representatives.

SEC. 541.  Whenever any real property sold by an executor, administrator, guardian, sheriff, tax collector, or other officer, shall be afterwards found to be the property of any person originally liable, or in whose hands the real property would be liable, to pay the demand or judgment for which, or for whose benefit the land was sold, or any one claiming under such person, the successful party not be entitled to the possession of the property, unless he refund the purchase money, with interest, deducting therefrom the value of the use and occupation, and injury done by waste and cultivation, to be assessed as aforesaid; and the judgment in such case may order a sale of the property to pay such purchase money and interest, if the same be not paid by a day to be fixed by the Court.

SEC. 542.  In such case the value of the use and occupation, and injury done by waste and cultivation, shall first be set off against the assessed value of the improvements; and if the value of the use and occupation exceed the value of the improvements, such excess shall be deducted from the purchase money.

Chapter II. Suits for partition of real or personal property.

SEC. 543.  Suits may be brought for the partition of real or personal property, by one part owner or tenant in common against another, in all cases; and the pleadings and practice in such suits, shall conform to the provisions of this Code.

SEC. 544.  Partition may be demanded in one suit, of all the several parcels of real property, to which the parties have title, and execution thereupon had by the Sheriff and three special commissioners to be appointed by the Court, by allotment to each party, of part in each parcel, or of part in one or more parcels, or of one or more individual parcels, with or without the addition of a part or parts of other parcels, as shall be most for the interest of the parties in general.

SEC. 545.  When it shall appear to the commissioners, in making partition, that a particular part or parcel ought to be assigned to a particular party, to be compensated by parts or parcels of equal value, or by the payment of money, they shall make the partition accordingly, returning their reasons therefor; and the Court may either confirm the report or set it aside, or grant an issue of fact to be tried by a jury.

SEC. 546.  Where the commissioners find that they cannot make a division of the property into the necessary parts and parcels, without greatly diminishing the value thereof, they shall report the fact; and unless an issue be demanded and the report proved to be untrue, the Court shall order a sale of the property, on such terms as shall appear to be most for the advantage of the parties.

SEC. 547.  Where it appears, from the nature of the property itself, that it cannot be divided, the Court may order a sale, without the appointment of commissioners.

SEC. 548.  In a suit for partition, where one party has been in possession, or made improvements, the value of the use or rent, and the increased value of the property caused by the improvements, shall be computed in favor of the respective parties.

Chapter III. Suits for waste.

SEC. 549.  In suits for waste, judgment of forfeiture and eviction shall only be given in favor of the person entitled to the reversion, against the tenant in possession, when the injury to the estate in reversion, shall be adjudged in the suit, to be equal to the value of the tenant’s estate or unexpired term, or to have been done in malice.

Chapter IV.  Suits for nuisance.

SEC. 550.  A suit to enjoin, or abate a nuisance, and for damages, may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance, or who is impeded thereby in the exercise of any right which he has.

Chapter V.  Suits for forfeitures and escheats.

SEC. 551.  Whenever any property shall escheat or be forfeited to the State, a suit shall be commenced by the District Attorney, in the county where the property is situated, for the recovery thereof; and like proceedings and judgment shall be had as in other suits to recover similar property.

Chapter VI.  Suits for divorce.

SEC. 552.  In a suit for divorce, the admission by the defendant, of any fact alleged in the complaint, except the fact of marriage, shall not dispense with the proof thereof; but all the facts essential to constitute a ground for divorce, must be sustained by proof, although not denied by the answer.

Chapter VII.  Suits respecting offices, franchises and trusts.

SEC. 553.  A suit may be commenced against any person or corporation in the following cases:
1.	When any person shall usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold or exercise any public office, or any franchise within this State, or any office in any corporation created by the authority of this State.
2.	Whenever any public officer shall have done or suffered any act which, by the provisions of law, shall work a forfeiture of his office.
3.	Where any association or number of persons shall act within this State as a corporation, without being legally incorporated.
4.	Where any corporation shall do or omit acts which amount to a surrender of their charter, or when they exercise powers not conferred by law.
5.	Where a private corporation is insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency.
6.	Where a corporation, board, or person, refuses to perform an act which the law specially enjoins, or a duty resulting from an office, trust or station; or,
7.	Where a corporation, board, or person, is about to do an acat which the law specially forbids, or which is in violation of a duty resulting from an office, trust or station.
SEC. 554. Such suit may be commenced by the District Attorney, in the name of the State of Texas, upon his own relation, whenever he shall deem it his duty to do so, or shall be directed by the Court or other competent authority, where the public have an interest; or by any person in his own name, whenever he claims an interest in the office, franchise, corporation or trust, which is the subject of the suit.

SEC. 555.  Damages may be claimed and recovered in such suit, as in other cases.

SEC. 556.  When several persons claim to be entitled to the same office, all should be made parties.

SEC. 557.  Where a corporation is dissolved, or its charter declared forfeited by the judgment of the Court, or, being a private corporation, is insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency, or where any association or number of persons are found guilty of having acted as a corporation without having been legally incorporated, the Court may appoint a receiver of its property and effects, take an account, and make a distribution thereof among the creditors and other persons entitled thereto.

Chapter VIII.  Suits for foreclosure of mortgages, and enforcement of other liens.

SEC. 558.  When default is made in the performance of any condition contained in a mortgage, the mortgage or his assigns, may proceed to foreclose the equity of redemption contained in the mortgage.

SEC. 559.  In rendering judgment of foreclosure, the Court shall order the mortgaged property, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be sold to satisfy the mortgage and costs of the suit.  The payment of the mortgage debt, with interest and costs, at any time before sale, shall satisfy the judgment.

SEC. 560.  The Court shall direct in the order of sale, that the balance due on the mortgage, and costs which may remain unsatisfied after the sale of the mortgaged property, shall be levied of any property of the mortgage debtor, not exempt from execution.

SEC. 561.  A copy of the judgment and order of sale shall be issued and certified by the Clerk, under the seal of the Court, to the Sheriff of the county where the property or any part thereof may be, who shall thereupon proceed to see the mortgaged property, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment, interest and costs as upon execution; and if any part of the judgment, interest and costs remain unsatisfied, execution may be issued, as in other cases, which may be levied upon any property of the mortgagor not exempt from execution.

SEC. 562.  Where the mortgage is on personal property, if the property, or enough thereof to satisfy the judgment, interests and costs, cannot be found, the Sheriff shall state the fact in his return, and thereupon execution shall issue as in other cases, which may be levied upon any property of the mortgagor not exempt from execution.

SEC. 563.  The plaintiff shall not proceed by separate suit to foreclose his mortgage, while he is prosecuting any other suit for the same debt or matter which is secured by the mortgage, or while he is seeking to obtain execution of any judgment in such other suit; nor shall he prosecute any other suit for the same matter, while he is foreclosing his mortgage, or prosecuting a judgment of foreclosure.

SEC. 564.  Whenever a complaint is filed for the foreclosure of a mortgage, upon which there shall be due any interest, or instalment of the principal, and there are other instalments not due, if the mortgagor, or any person for him, pay into Court the principal and interest due, with costs, at any time before final judgment, the complaint shall be dismissed; if such payment be made after final judgment, proceedings thereon shall be stayed, subject to be enforced on a subsequent default in the payment of any instalment of the principal or interest thereafter becoming due.  In the final judgment, it shall be directed at what time, and upon what default, any subsequent execution shall issue.

SEC. 565.  In such cases, after final judgment, the Court shall ascertain whether the property can be sold in parcels, and if it can be done without injury to the interest of the parties, the Court shall direct so much only of the premises to be sold as will be sufficient to pay the amount then due on the mortgage, with costs; and the judgment shall remain and may be enforced upon any subsequent default, unless the amount due shall be paid before a sale.

SEC. 566.  If the mortgaged property cannot be sold in parcels, the Court shall order the whole to be sold; and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied first to the payment of the principal due, interest and costs, and then to the residue secured by the mortgage and not due; and if the residue do not bear interest, a deduction shall be made there from discounting the legal interest, or if conventional interest was included in the principal sum, such conventional interest.  And in all such cases where the proceeds of the sale are more than sufficient to pay the amount due and costs, the surplus shall be paid to the mortgage debtor, his heirs or assigns, unless the same be claimed by the holder of a subsequent lien.

SEC. 567.  Whenever an execution shall issue upon a judgment recovered for a debt secured by mortgage, other than the judgment of foreclosure herein provided, the plaintiff shall endorse thereon a brief description of the mortgaged property, and the equity of redemption shall in no case be sold on such execution.

Chapter IX. Remedies of sureties.

SEC. 568.  Any person bound as surety upon any contract for the payment of money or the performance of any act, when the right of action has accrued, may require, by notice in writing, the creditor or obligee forthwith to institute a suit upon the contract.

SEC. 569.  If the creditor or obligee, not being under legal disability, shall fail to bring his suit to the first term of the Court thereafter, or to the second term, showing good cause why he did not bring it to the first term, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution, the surety giving such notice, shall be discharged from all liability theron.

SEC. 570.  When any suit is brought against two or more defendants upon a contract, any one or more of the defendants being surety for the others, the surety may, upon a written complaint to the Court, cause the question of suretyship to be tried and determined upon the issue made for the parties defendant, at the trial of the cause, or at any time before or after the trial, or at a subsequent term; but such proceedings shall not delay the suit of the plaintiff.

SEC. 571.  If the finding of such issue be in favor of the surety, the Court shall make an order direction the Sheriff to levy the execution first upon and exhaust the property of the principal, before a levy shall be made upon the property of the surety; and the Clerk shall endorse a memorandum of the order on the execution.

SEC. 572.  When any person being surety in any undertaking whatever, shall be compelled to pay any judgment, or any part thereof, or shall make any payment which is applied upon such judgment, by reason of such suretyship, or when any Sheriff or other officer, or any surety upon his official bond, shall be compelled to pay any judgment or any part thereof, by reason of any default of such officer, except for failing to pay over any money collected, or for wasting property levied on, the judgment shall not be discharged by such payment, but shall remain in force for the use of the surety, officer, or other person making such payment; and after the judgment creditor is paid, so much of the judgment as remains undischarged, may be prosecuted to execution for the use of such surety, officer or other person.

SEC. 573.  Any one of several sureties having paid and satisfied the judgment creditor, shall have the remedy provided in the preceding Article, against the co-sureties, to collect of them the ratable proportion each is equitably bound to pay.

SEC. 574.  The remedy provided for sureties by this Chapter, extends to endorsers, guarantors, drawers of bills, which have been accepted and every other suretyship, whether created by express contract or by the operation of law.

Chapter X.  Trial of right to property seized on attachment, sequestration, or execution.

SEC. 575.  Where personal property which is levied on under attachment, sequestration, or execution, is claimed by any person who is not a party to the writ, such person may reclaim possession, by making affidavit of his title thereto, stating the grounds of such title, and delivering such affidavit to the Sheriff, together with a bond to the effect indicated in the preceding Article.  The affidavit may be made by any person who has personal knowledge of the facts.

SEC. 576.  The bond to be given by such claimant or some person for him, shall be signed by one or more sureties to be approved by the Sheriff, shall describe the property, and state the separate value of each article, and be to the effect that the surety or sureties are bound unto the person at whose instance the writ was issued, in an amount equal to double the value of the property, for the delivery thereof to the Sheriff, if such delivery be adjudged, and all damages and costs that may be awarded against the claimant.

SEC. 577.  The affidavit shall be endorsed on the bond, and may refer thereto for a description of the property.

SEC. 578.  The Sheriff, upon the receipt of such affidavit and bond, shall deliver the property to the claimant.

SEC. 579.  The Sheriff shall endorse on the writ, that such claim has been made, and affidavit and bond given, stating by whom, and shall forthwith deliver the oath and bond to the Clerk of the District Court of his county.

SEC. 580.  Where the writ was issued from the District Court of another country, or from the Supreme Court, the Sheriff shall deliver with the oath and bond a copy of the writ, and endorsement thereon; the endorsement being signed by him officially.

SEC. 581.  Where the Sheriff shall have taken an indemnifying bond, he shall state the fact in his return, and deliver the bond with the oath and bond of the claimant, to the Clerk of the District Court.

SEC. 582.  The giving of the bond to try the right of property, shall discharge the levy upon the property claimed; but the writ may be levied upon any other property of the defendant, not exempt from execution, liable thereto.

SEC. 583.  The Clerk, on the receipt of the oath and bond, or of the oath, bond, and copy of the writ, as the case may be, shall immediately docket the proceeding, as a suit, in which the claimant shall be the plaintiff, and the person for whose benefit the writ issued shall be the defendant.

SEC. 584.  Such suit shall be disposed of at the first term of the Court, like suits in which citation has been duly served.

SEC. 585.  The statement of the plaintiff’s claim or title, as contained in the affidavit, shall stand as a complaint, subject to amendment as in other cases, and must be answered by the defendant, as in other suits.

SEC. 586.  The defendant in execution, attachment, or sequestration, shall be deemed to be a party, so far that he may demand any relief to which he may appear to be entitled against either the plaintiff or defendant, or apply for any order that is proper to protect his own rights; but the trial of the main issue shall not be delayed thereby.

SEC. 587.  Where such claim shall be made to property levied on by attachment at the commencement of, or during the progress of a suit, the trial may be suspended by order of the Court, until the suit in which the attachment was obtained shall have been determined.  

SEC. 588.  Where such claim shall be made to property levied on by sequestration, the trial thereof may be suspended by order of the Court, until the suit in which the sequestration was obtained, shall have been determined, or said suits may be consolidated.

SEC. 589.  In the absence of any proof on the trial, judgment shall be rendered for the defendant.

SEC. 590.  If the plaintiff prove that the property was in his possession, or in the possession of his agent, or bailee, at the time of the levy, it shall devolve on the defendant to rebut the presumption of ownership arising from such possession.

SEC. 591.  Where the presumption of ownership arising from possession is rebutted, the burden of proof again rests on the plaintiff.

SEC. 592.  Either party may allege and prove that the property or part thereof, was not appraised at its true value, whereupon the jury or the Court trying the facts, shall find the value of such property.

SEC. 593.  When the plaintiff fails to establish his right to the property or any part thereof, damages shall be awarded in favor of the defendant, not exceeding ten percent on the value of such property nor on the amount claimed in the writ.

SEC. 594.  The presumption shall be that the amount which appeared to be due on the execution, or the amount of the judgment in the suit, in which the attachment of sequestration was obtained, is still due, unless the amount be reduced by proper allegations and proof.

SEC. 595.  If the judgment be in favor of the defendant, it shall show, 
1.	The amount of principal, interest, and costs, still due and unpaid on the original judgment, or judgment in the suit in which the attachment was obtained.
2.	The property as to which the plaintiff failed to establish his right, and the separate value thereof.
3.	It shall require such property or enough thereof to satisfy said principal, interest, and costs, to be delivered to the Sheriff to be sold, to satisfy said amount.
4.	It shall provide that in case of the failure of the plaintiff or any person for him, to deliver such property, in like good condition as when received, or any part thereof, or enough thereof to satisfy the said amount of principal, interest, and costs, the Sheriff shall levy and collect of any property of the plaintiff or his sureties not exempt from execution, an amount equal to the ascertained value or the property not delivered, not exceeding the balance due.
5.	It shall be to the further effect that the defendant recover of the plaintiff and his sureties, the damages assessed, if any, and the costs.

SEC. 596.  Where the property has been levied on by a writ of sequestration, if the writ was obtained in a suit for the enforcement of a lien, or claim for money, the judgment for the defendant shall be the same as provided in the preceding Article; but if the suit be for the recovery of specific property, the suit shall be as follows:
1.	It shall show the judgment in the suit in which the sequestration was obtained.
2.	The property as to which the plaintiff failed to establish his right, and the separate value thereof.
3.	It shall require such property to be delivered to the Sheriff, to be by him delivered to the defendant.
	It shall provide that in case of the failure of the plaintiff or any person for him, to deliver such property in like good condition as when received, or any part thereof, the Sheriff shall levy and collect of any property of the plaintiff or his sureties, not exempt from execution, an amount equal to the value of the property not delivered.
5.It shall be to the further effect, that the defendant recover of the plaintiff and his sureties, the damages assessed, if any, and the costs.
	Where the main suit and the suit for the trial of the right of property have been consolidated, the fact mentioned in subdivision one is sufficiently shown by the judgment in the case, without the necessity of repeating it.

SEC. 597.  Where the Sheriff shall have taken and returned an indemnifying bond, or if the defendant shall appear and contest the claim of property, the plaintiff may claim damages for the unlawful taking of the property, and if he establish his right thereto, the jury or court trying the facts shall assess the damages, for which the plaintiff shall have judgment against the defendant, and after citation, against his sureties, as in the case of persons jointly bound.

SEC. 598.  Where the defendant in execution or attachment makes affidavit that personal property levied on is exempt from the execution of attachment, and gives the forthcoming bond as provided in Article 575, he shall be entitled to recover possession of the property; and the like proceedings shall be had to try the question, as is provided in this Chapter, for the trial of the right of property claimed by a third person.

SEC. 599.  A person interested and desiring to have the proceedings of the County Court, pertaining to the estates of decedants and wards, or any other matter, revised and corrected, may file his complaint as in other cases, together with a certified copy of the proceedings to be revised, and cause the adverse party to be cited to answer the same, as in other cases.

SEC. 602.  Where a certified copy of the proceedings, owing to the emergency of the case, is not filed with the complaint, it may be filed afterwards; or the District Court or Judge thereof may grant an order for a writ of certiorari to be directed to the county Court, to certify a copy of the proceedings complained of to the District Court.

In order to constitute sufficient cause, the facts stated must show either that the Justice of the Peace had not jurisdiction, or that injustice was done to the applicant, by the final determination of the suit or proceeding, and that such injustice was not caused by his own inexcusable neglect.

If, in the opinion of the Sheriff, the property so designated will not sell for enough to satisfy the execution and costs of sale, he shall notify the defendant or his agent thereof; whereupon the latter may make an additional designation.

Where the Court house or house used by the court has been destroyed by fire or other cause, and another has not been designated by the proper authority, the place shall nevertheless be deemed to be the Court house door.

SEC. 680.  Personal property, other than slaves, taken in execution shall be sold on the premises where it is taken in execution or at the Court house door of the county; or at some other public place, if owing to the nature of the property, it is inconvenient to exhibit it to purchasers, at the Court house door.

SEC. 685.  In case the purchaser of any real estate or slaves upon execution, having paid the purchase money therefor, shall die before a deed of conveyance shall have been executed to him, the Sheriff shall convey such real estate or slaves to the purchaser nevertheless; and the conveyance shall have the same effect as if it had been executed in the lifetime of the purchaser.

SEC. 690.  Or the Sheriff may re-expose and sell the property, on the same day if there be sufficient time; if not, he may re advertise the same; and if the amount bid at the second sale, shall not equal the amount bid at the first sale, and the costs of the second sale, the first purchaser shall be liable for the deficiency and damages thereon, not exceeding ten per cent and interest and costs, to be recovered by a like notice and motion, as provided in the preceding Article; provided, that if the execution has been satisfied, the motion shall be made by the defendant in execution.

SEC. 694.  Money made on execution, out of personal property, must be first applied to the execution first delivered to the Sheriff, except where such creditor refused to give an indemnifying bond, and the same was given by one having a later execution; money made out of real estate, shall be applied to the execution under which the sale is made.

SEC. 695.  When the Sheriff has collected money on execution, he shall pay over the same at the earliest opportunity.

SEC. 696.  If any Sheriff shall neglect or refuse to levy upon or sell any property justly liable to execution, when the same might have been done, he and his sureties shall be liable to the execution creditor, in a suit on his official bond, for the value of such property, not be exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the execution and costs.

SEC. 697.  If any Sheriff shall neglect or refuse to return any execution, as required by law, or shall make a false return thereon, he and his sureties shall be liable to the execution creditor, in a suit on his official bond, for such amount as he might and should have levied by virtue of the execution, and damages thereon not exceeding ten percent.

The Clerk shall keep an execution docket, in which he shall enter a statement of all executions, as they are issued by him, specifying the names of the parties, the amount of the judgment, the amount due thereon, the rate of interest where it exceeds eight per cent, the costs, the date of issuing the execution, to whom delivered, and the return of the Sheriff thereon, with the date of such return; and such docket entries shall be taken and deemed to be a record.

SEC. 703.  Any Clerk who shall fail to keep such a docket, or shall neglect to make the entries, shall be liable to any person injured, for the amount of damages sustained by such neglect, to be recovered in a suit against him and his sureties, on his official bond.

Chapter VII.  Proceedings supplementary to execution.

SEC. 704.  When an execution which requires the Sheriff to satisfy the same out of the property of the debtor is returned unsatisfied after a demand on the defendant or his agent to point out property, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return made, is entitled to an order from the Judge of the Court, requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property, before such Judge, at a time and place specified in the order, within the county where such judgment debtor resides, or where the execution issued.

SEC. 705.  After the issue of an execution which requires the Sheriff to satisfy the same out of the property of the debtor, and upon proof by affidavit of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge, that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such Court or Judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property, before such county where such judgment debtor resides, or where the execution issued.

SEC. 706.  On an examination under the two preceding Articles, either party may examine witnesses in his behalf, and the judgment debtor may be examined in the same manner as a witness.

SEC. 707.  Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the Judge may, upon proof by affidavit or other wise, to his satisfaction, that there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the State, or concealing himself, and that there is reason to believe that he has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, issue a warrant requiring the Sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such Judge, in the country where the execution issued, or where such debtor resides.  Upon being brought before the Judge he may be examined on oath, and if it then appear that there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the State, and that he has property which he has unjustly refused to apply to such judgment, he may be ordered to give bond, with one or more sureties, that he will from time to time attend before the Judge as he shall direct, and that he will not, during the pendency of the proceedings, dispose of any portion of his property, not exempt from execution.  In default of entering into such bond, he may be committed to prison by warrant or the Judge, pending the adjournments of such examination, until the same be finished.

SEC. 708.  If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such person or the chief officer or managing agent of such corporation may be ordered to be and appear at the next term of the Court, when called, to form an issue and try the fact, and in the meantime to refrain from transferring or otherwise disposing of such property or interest; but such order may be modified or dissolved by the Judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he shall direct.  The proceedings in such cases shall be similar to the proceedings on return of a writ of garnishment on original attachment.

SEC. 709.  No personal shall, on examination pursuant to this Chapter, be excused from answering any question, on the ground that his examination will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud; but his answer shall not be used as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution.

SEC. 710.  After the issue of an execution which requires the Sheriff to satisfy the same out of the property of the judgment debtor, any person indebted to such judgment debtor may pay to the Sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as shall be necessary to satisfy the execution; and the Sheriff’s receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid.

SEC. 711.  Where the defendant in execution fails to point out property sufficient to satisfy the execution, the plaintiff in execution, his agent or attorney, may make an affidavit and deliver it to the Sheriff, that such affiant has just reason to believe that another person or persons, is, or are, indebted to said defendant or defendants or one of them or hath, or have, effects of such defendant, or defendants, or one of them, in his or her hands; whereupon the Sheriff shall prepare a copy of such affidavit, for each person and endorse thereon as follows: [name of the person.] - “Take notice, that unless you appear at the next term of the District Court in and for the county of [county whence the execution issued] to answer touching the matters herein, execution will issue against you for [amount due on the execution] that being the amount due from [defendant in execution] to [plaintiff in execution.]  And you are further notified to retain said amount, or property to the value of said amount, of the property of said [defendant in execution] now in your possession, to satisfy said execution,” and sign the same officially, and deliver it to such person, and make return accordingly; and thereupon the Court shall examine and proceed against said garnishee or garnishees in the same manner as prescribed by law, against garnishees in original attachments.

SEC. 712.  Where the garnishee resides in a county other than that from which the execution issues, the notice to him to appear shall state that he must appear in person by affidavit stating whether or not he is indebted to the defendant or defendants in execution or either of them and how much; and whether or not he has any and what effects of such defendant or defendants, or either of them, in his hands.

SEC. 713.  Witnesses may be required to appear and testify on any proceedings under this Chapter, in the same manner as upon the trial of an issue.

SEC. 714.  All examinations and answers under this Chapter, shall be on oath; and when a corporation answers, the answer shall be on oath of an officer thereof.

SEC. 715.  The Judge may order any property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment.

SEC. 716.  The Judge may allow to the judgment creditor, or to any party so examined, whether a party to the suit or not, witness fees and disbursements.

SEC. 719.  A family is dissolved by the divorce of husband and wife, or by the death, coming of age, or marriage, of any member, after which the constituents required by the preceding Article do not remain.

SEC. 720.  When a family is dissolved, the property exempt from execution or forced sale, passes to the constituents or to the survivors, exempt from any liability incurred pending the existence of the family.  The said property thereupon ceases to be exempt from execution and forced sale, for liabilities afterwards incurred unless those to whom it passes can claim such exemption under Article 717 or 721.

SEC. 721.  The following property shall be reserved to persons who are not constituents of a family, exempt from execution and every species of forced sale, except for the purchase money, or a part thereof:

SEC. 722.

SEC. 723.  Such sale, although ordered, shall not be made, unless the amount bid exceed the value of the homestead exempted from forced sale; and the surplus only shall be applied to the judgment or judgments or other lien, according to their priority, as in other cases.

SEC. 724.  The two thousand dollars, or the one thousand, as the case may be, shall belong to the family or person whose homestead was sold, exempt in the same manner as the homestead, while it continues the same.

SEC. 725.  Where a husband is the head of a family, or where children under twenty one years of age and unmarried, constitute a part thereof, the Court shall make such order as will ensure the investment of the two thousand dollars in another homestead.

SEC. 726.  Where there is more personal property of the same kind than is exempt from execution, the head of the family or other person may point out the parts to be levied on; but if he fail to do so, the officer making the levy may select, taking care to leave the amount of each sort, exempt from forced sale.

SEC. 727.  The provisions of this Chapter, so far as they extend the exemption beyond that heretofore established by the law and the Constitution, shall apply to such liabilities only as shall be incurred after this Act shall take affect.

SEC. 733.  The subpoena may require the witness to bring with him any books, writing, or other thing, under his control, which he may be bound by law to produce in evidence.

SEC. 734.  A subpoena may be served by a Sheriff or his deputy, a Coroner or Constable, whose return shall be proof of service; or it may be served by any white person over sixteen years of age, whose affidavit shall be presumptive evidence of service; or the witness may acknowledge service, in waiting on the subpoena.

SEC. 735.  Service of a subpoena may be made by reading it to the witness, or by delivering to him an attested copy, or a ticket containing its substance.

SEC. 736.  A person, present before any Court or officer who has power to take his testimony or affidavit, may be required to testify as though he had been regularly subpoenaed.

SEC. 737.

But he shall be discharged from imprisonment by the final deposition of the cause.

SEC. 748.  A female shall not be compelled to attend in Court for oral examination as a witness, unless it be made to appear by the affidavit of the party, and the written statement of his attorney, that her testimony is important and that the just and proper effect thereof cannot in a reasonable degree be obtained without an oral examination before the jury.

SEC. 754.  Every person for whose immediate benefit a suit is prosecuted or defended, though not a party to the suit, may, at the instance of the adverse party, be examined as a witness, in the same manner, and shall be subject to the same rules, as if he were a party to the suit.

	The party desiring to take such deposition, may file his interrogatories to the witness, with said Clerk, who shall cause a notice to be published in the newspaper published nearest to the place at which the suit is pending, for at least once each week for four successive weeks, stating the number of the suit, the names of the original parties, in what Court the suit is pending, the names and residences of the witnesses to whom the interrogatories are propounded, and that a commission will issue on or after the thirtieth day after the last publication is required to be made, to take the deposition of such witnesses, to be read as evidence in the cause, in behalf of the party asking the same.  On or after said thirtieth day, the commission shall issue as in other cases; and the depositions when taken, shall be as valid as those taken after personal service of the notice and interrogatories.

SECTION 5.  Depositions to perpetuate evidence.

SEC. 787.  When a person may anticipate the institution of a suit in which he may be interested, and shall desire to perpetuate the testimony of any witness or witnesses to be read upon the trial thereof, such person, his agent or attorney, may present a statement in writing, supported by affidavit, to the Judge of the District Court of the district in which such suit is required or permitted to be instituted, setting forth the name and residence of the witness, the subject of the expected controversy, the names of the persons known to be adversely interested therein, and asking that the deposition of the witness or witnesses be taken and perpetuated.

SEC. 788.  Before such deposition can be taken, the persons named in the statement as the expected adverse party, shall be personally served with a copy of the statement, of the order of the Judge made thereon, and of the interrogatories to be propounded to the witnesses, and with a notice that application will be made to the Clerk of the Court, with whom such statement and order required to be filed, for the commission to take such deposition.

SEC. 791.  When the person to be notified is out of this State, but is within the United States, such notice with a copy of the statement, order, interrogatories and proof of service, may be made and proved in the same way that the service of a notice and copy of the complaint is permitted to be made and proved by Article 193; and when no other time is prescribed by the order of the Judge, the commission may issue after the expiration of sixty days after such service.

SEC. 795.  If a witness cannot write, his name may be written by another person at the end of his deposition, and he shall make his mark near thereto.

SEC. 796.  No person who is a party to the suit, nor the agent or attorney of such person, shall be present when the answers of a witness are taken.

SEC. 799.  After the deposition has been filed, it may be opened by the Clerk, at the request of either party, his agent or attorney.

The deposition shall remain on file for the inspection of either party.

SEC. 800.  Exceptions to depositions shall be writing, specifying the grounds of objection, and filed with the papers of the suit, and notice thereof given to the adverse party or his attorney.

SEC. 801.  No objection to the form of a deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the answers because the questions may be leading, or for any other cause, except incompetency of the witness or incompetency or irrelevancy of the testimony, shall be taken after the parties have announced themselves ready for the trial of the cause.  And all such as are previously taken shall be decided by the Court, before the party, that sued out the commission, shall be required to announce whether he is ready for trial.

SEC. 802.  If depositions be on file and among the papers of the cause when it may be called and continued, or if they be filed at any time before or during a term of the Court, and reasonable notice thereof be given to the adverse party, before its final adjournment, all the objections thereto, enumerated in Article 801, or contemplated by it, must be taken in time to try the same during the term of the Court, or they shall be deemed to be waived.

Chapter VIII.  Depositions to be used in other states.

A party desiring to take depositions in this State, to be used in judicial proceedings in other States or countries, may produce to any offer in this State authorized to take depositions in the county where the witness resides, or is staying, a commission authorizing the taking of such depositions, whereupon it shall be the duty of such officer to issue a subpoena for the witnesses to attend at a specified time and place for examination; and, in case of their failure to attend, or refusal to testify, the same proceedings shall be had as in like cases for taking depositions to be used in this State.
	
Chapter IX.  General rules for the examination of witnesses.

SEC. 808.  The Court shall exercise a reasonable control over the mode of interrogation, so as to make it rapid, distinct, as little annoying to the witness, and as effective for the extraction of truth, as may be; but, subject to this control, the parties may put such legal and pertinent questions as they may see fit.  The Court, however, may stop the production of further evidence on a particular point, where the evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reasonable doubt.

SEC. 809.  The examination of a witness by the party producing him, is the direct examination; the examination of the same witness upon the same matter, by the adverse party, is the cross-examination.  The direct examination must be completed before the cross-examination begins, unless the Court otherwise direct.

SEC. 810.  A question that suggests to the witness  the answer which the examining party desires, is a leading question.

SEC. 811.  On the direct examination, leading questions are not allowed, except under special circumstances making it appear that the ends of justice require it.

SEC. 812.  On cross examination, the adverse party may put leading questions; but if he examines the witness on new matters, such examination becomes direct, and subject to all the rules respecting the same.

SEC. 813.  The party producing a witness is not allowed to impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, unless it be a case in which it was indispensable that the party should produce him; but he may contradict him by other evidence, and may show that he has made statements different from his present testimony.

SEC. 814.  A witness may be impeached by the party against whom he is called, by contradictory evidence, or by evidence that his reputation for truth is bad, or that his moral character is such as to render him unworthy of belief; but not by evidence of particular wrongful acts, except that it may be shown by the record of a judgment, that he has been convicted of felony.

SEC. 815.  A witness may also be impeached by evidence that he has made at other times, statements inconsistent with his present testimony.  But before this can be done, his previous statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of the times, places and persons present, and he must be asked whether he made such statements, and if so, he must be allowed to explain them.  If the statements be in writing, they must be shown to the witness before any question is put to him concerning them.

SEC. 816.  Evidence of the good character of a witness is inadmissible until his character has been impeached.

SEC. 817.  A witness once examined, cannot be re-examined as to the same matter, without leave of the Court.  But he may be re-examined as to any new matter upon which he has been examined by the adverse party.  After the examination on both sides is concluded, the witness cannot be recalled without leave of the Court.

SEC. 818.  If either party require it, the Court or officer before whom the examination is had, may exclude from the room any witnesses of both parties, not at the time under examination, so that they may not hear the testimony of the other witnesses.

SEC. 819.  Where an attorney has any cause to believe that a question which he is about to put to a witness will be objected to by the counsel for the adverse party, it shall be his duty first to reduce his question to writing and hand it to such counsel; if objected be made it shall be submitted to the Court, and if the Judge desires to hear argument, he may send the jury out of the Court room charge of a bailiff, until the argument is concluded.

SEC. 820.  The Judge or a juror may be called as a witness by either party; but in such case, it is in the discretion of the Court to suspend the trial, and order it to take place before another Judge or jury; and where a party knows, at the time the jury are sworn, that a juror is to be called by him as a witness, he shall then disclose it, and such person shall be excluded from the jury.

SEC. 821.  Whenever a writing is shown to a witness, it may be inspected by the adverse party; and, if proved by the witness, it must be read to the jury before his testimony is closed; otherwise it cannot be read, unless the witness be recalled.

Chapter X.  Of the proof of instruments offered in evidence.

SEC. 822.  When any part of the pleadings in a cause shall be founded, in whole or in part, upon any obligation, contract, conveyance, or any other instrument in writing, charged to have been executed by the opposite party, or by his authority, and not alleged therein to be lost or destroyed, such obligation, contract, conveyance, or other instrument or note in writing, shall be received as evidence, without the necessity of proving its execution, unless the party by whom or by whose authority such obligation, contract, conveyance, or other instrument in writing, is charged to have been executed, shall, in his pleading, supported by affidavit, deny the execution thereof; and the like rule shall prevail in all suits against endorsers, and securities upon any obligation, contract, or other instrument in writing.

SEC. 823.  When any such contract, obligation, conveyance, or other instrument, shall be charged as aforesaid to have been executed by any testator, or interstate, it shall also by received in evidence in like manner, unless some suspicion is cast upon it, before the trial begins, by the affidavit of the executor or administrator, of such testator or intestate.

SEC. 824.  All written assignments, transfers, or endorsements of the instruments mentioned in the two preceding Articles, shall be received as evidence in like manner, unless the party, against whom they are to be used, shall, in his pleading, supported by affidavit, allege that he believes some one or more of such assignments, transfers, or endorsements are forged.  The affidavit may be made by a party who is not alleged to have made such assignment, transfer or endorsement, at any time before the commencement of the trial.

SEC. 825.  The party holding such obligation, contract, conveyance, or other instrument, shall be compelled to exhibit the same on request of the opposite party or his attorney; and if he fail or refuse to make such exhibition within a reasonable time, he shall be required to prove its execution, assignments, transfers, and endorsements, although the answer denying the same be not supported by affidavit. – This Article controls the second subdivision of Article 208, and the first subdivision of Article 221.

SEC. 826.  If any pleading be founded upon any obligation, contract, or other instrument of writing, which may be filed in a suit in any other Court of this State, a certified copy of the same, under the hand of the Clerk and seal of the Court in which the original may be filed, shall be admitted in like manner as the original could be.  But if the defendant should plead and file an affidavit in support thereof, that such other obligation, contract, or other instrument, was not executed by him or by his authority, the Clerk of the Court having the custody of such original, shall, on being summoned as a witness, attend with the same on the trial of the issue, and the execution of such original shall be proved as in other cases.

SEC. 827.  Copies of the records of all public offices, and Courts of this State, certified under the hand and seal, (if there be one,) of the lawful keeper of such records, shall be admitted in all cases where the records themselves would be admissible, with or without further proof as the originals would be.

SEC. 828.  Translated copies of records in the Land Office, certified under the hand of the translator, with the certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office that he is such translator, attested with the seal of said office, shall be prima facie evidence, in all cases where the original records would be evidence.
SEC. 829.  Every instrument of writing, which has been legally recorded in the office of the Clerk of the county Court, or has been duly authenticated for registration, and has been filed among the papers of the cause, and two days notice thereof been given to the adverse party, or his attorney, before the commencement of the trial, shall be admitted as evidence, without the necessity of proving its execution, unless the adverse party or some person for him, file an affidavit, stating that he believes such instrument of writing to be forged.

SEC. 830.  When a party to a suit shall, two days before the trial, file among the papers of a cause, a certified copy of the record of an instrument recorded as set forth in the preceding Article, and shall give two days notice thereof to the opposite party, his agent or attorney, and shall file an affidavit stating that such original has been lost, or that he cannot procure the same, such copy shall be admitted in like manner as the original could be, unless the opposite party or some person for him, file an affidavit before the commencement of the trial, stating that he believes the original was forged.

SEC. 831.  Copies of all conveyances and instruments of writing, between private individuals, where the originals were filed or deposited in the office of any Alcalde or Judge in Texas, before the first Monday in February, 1837, shall be admitted in like manner as the originals might be, and shall have the force and effect of such originals, provided such copies shall be certified to under the hand and seal of the officer with whom such conveyance or instruments of writing may be deposited.

SEC. 832.  Nothing contained in any of the three preceding Articles, shall be so construed as to prevent a party from proving the execution of any of the instruments there in referred to, in any other mode permitted by the laws of evidence.

SEC. 833.  Whenever an affidavit shall be filed under the provisions of any Article in this Chapter, denying the execution of any instrument on file, or produced in evidence, it shall be the duty of the Clerk to retain such instrument, and not permit it to be taken away without an order of the Court, for that purpose.

SEC. 834.  When it becomes necessary to prove the execution of an instrument to which there is one or more subscribing witnesses, none of whom reside in the county where the cause is pending, or if they reside in the county but are incapable of attending or testifying at the trial, the execution of the instrument shall be regarded as proved by proof of the handwriting of the party who made it, and of one of the subscribing witnesses thereto.

SEC. 835.  When any officer to whom the legal custody of any record, instrument, or paper shall belong, shall certify under his hand and official seal, that he has made diligent examination in his office for such record, document or paper, and that it cannot be found, such certificate shall be presumptive evidence of the facts so certified, in all cases, matters and proceedings, in the same manner, and with like effect, as if such officer has personally testified to the same in the Court, or before the officer before whom such cause, matter, or proceeding may be pending.

SEC. 836.  Either party may exhibit to the adverse party, or his attorney of record, any paper material to the suit, and request a written admission of its execution.  If the party so requested, or his attorney, shall fail to make such admission for two days, the party making such request may proceed to procure evidence to prove its execution, and if the execution thereof be proven or admitted at the trial, the party failing previously to make the admission, shall pay reasonable costs for obtaining such evidence, unless it appear to the satisfaction of the Court, that there was good reason for withholding such admission.

SEC. 837.  The Court before which a suit is pending, may, in its discretion, upon motion duly served, order either party to give to the other, within a specified time, an inspection or copy, or permission to take a copy, of any books, papers, or documents, in his possession, or under his control, containing evidence relating to any cause pending in Court.  If compliance with the order be refused, the Court, on motion, may exclude such books, papers or documents from being given in evidence by the party refusing, and in a proper case may also punish such party for contempt.

SEC. 838.  Where an instrument is partly written and partly printed, the written shall control the printed portion, when the two are inconsistent.

SEC. 839.  When a subscribing witness denies or does not recollect the execution of an instrument to which his name appears, the execution may be proved by other evidence.

SEC. 840.  It is competent in every case to give evidence of handwriting, by comparison, made by experts, or by the jury; but proof by comparison only shall not  be sufficient to establish the handwriting of a witness, or party, who denies his signature under oath.

Chapter XI.  Of the proof of the private acts of this state and of the laws of other states.

SEC. 841.  Any private Act of this State may be proved,
1.	By the statute books of the State, containing private Acts.

2.	By proving that such copies of volumes, codes, or digests, have been commonly admitted as evidence of the existing law, in the Courts or judicial tribunals of such States, territories, or governments; or
3.	When books purporting to be printed or published under the authority of such State, territory or foreign country, are deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, certified copies of any laws therein contained, under the hand of the Secretary or of his Clerk, attested by the seal of said office, may, in like manner, be admitted as evidence; or
4.	The public seal of such State, territory, or country, affixed to a copy of a written law, shall also be admissible in evidence.

SEC. 843.  The books of the reports of cases adjudged in the Courts of any other State, territory, or country, may also be admitted as presumptive evidence of their laws, in the Courts of this State.

SEC. 844.  The rate of interest allowed by the laws of any State of the United States, may be proved by the testimony of any witness acquainted with such rate of interest.

Chapter XII.  Miscellaneous provisions on evidence.

SEC. 845.  In all suits by the State against revenue officers, and other persons accountable for public money, a transcript from the books and proceedings of the office of the Comptroller, certified under his hand and seal of office, shall be admitted and read as evidence upon the trial; and all copies of bonds, contracts or other papers relating to or connected with such transcript, when certified under the hand and seal of the Comptroller, to be true copies of the original on file in his office, may be annexed to such transcript, and shall have equal validity, and be entitled to the same degree of credit, which would be due to the original papers if produced and authenticated in Court.  But where such suit is brought on a bond or other instrument in writing, the original, if it be not lost, must be produced at the trial, provided the defendant deny the execution of the instrument in his answer, and such denial be supported by affidavit.

SEC. 846.  When part of an act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence, by one party, the whole act, declaration, conversation or writing, on the same subject, may be enquired into by the other: as when a letter is read, all other letters on the same subject, between the same parties, may be given in evidence.  And when a detailed act, conversation or writing, is given in evidence, any other act, conversation or writing, which is necessary to make it fully understood, or to explain the same, may also be given in evidence.

SEC. 847.  When the terms of an agreement have been intended in a different sense by the different parties to it, that sense is to prevail against either party, in which he supposed the other understood it; and when different constructions of a provision are equally proper, that is to be taken which is most beneficial to the party in whose favor the provision was made.

SEC. 848.  The following testimony shall be prima facie evidence of an account:

SEC. 897.  A simple appeal is taken by giving notice thereof in writing to the adverse party or his attorney of record, and causing a copy of such notice to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court below, together with the proof of the service thereof, and a bond signed by one or more sureties to be approved by the Clerk, in the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, to the effect that the appellant will pay all costs that may be adjudged against him on the appeal.  Where notice of appeal has been given as prescribed in Article 481, if the bond herein required be filed within twenty days after the day fixed by law for the adjournment of the term at which the judgment was rendered, the notice required by the first part of this Article shall not be necessary.

SEC. 898.  Instead of the bond provided in the preceding Article, the appellant may deposit with the Clerk, with whom the judgment was entered, two hundred and fifty dollars, as security for the costs of the appeal.  A certificate by the Clerk, of the fact of such deposit, shall take the place of the bond in all cases where the latter or a copy thereof, is mentioned.

SEC. 899.  Where the appellant makes affidavit that he is unable to give the bond or deposit the amount, as provided in the two preceding Articles, he may take a simple appeal without such bond or deposit.

A suspensive appeal is taken in the same manner as a simple appeal, except that instead of a bond for costs only, the appellant must cause to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court below, a bond signed by one or more sureties to be approved by the Clerk, in double the amount of the debt or damages, or the value of the personal property adjudged, to the effect that the appellant will perform any judgment which the Supreme Court may render against him on the appeal.

SEC. 904.  If the judgment appealed from directs the execution of a conveyance, assignment or other instrument, the appeal is not suspensive, unless the instrument be executed and deposited with the Clerk of the Court below, to abide the judgment of the Supreme Court.

SEC. 905.

Where such order is entered, the bond must be filed, signed by one or more sureties to be approved by the Clerk, in the amount fixed by the order to the effect that during the possession of such property by the appellant, he will not commit, or suffer to be committed, any waste thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed, he will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property, from the time of the appeal until the delivery of possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment.

SEC. 906.  An appeal under the third subdivision of Article 13, is taken by giving notice thereof as provided in Article 481 and filing the bond for costs, as provided in Article 897; and, when so taken, suspends the interlocutory judgment.  If not so taken, the party may claim a revision of such interlocutory judgment, after final judgment rendered, as contemplated in Article 893.

SEC. 907.  When notice of an appeal from an interlcutory judgment, under the third subdivision of Article 13, is entered of record, it may also be entered, if both parties agree, that the appeal shall await the final judgment in the suit; in which case, the notice shall have the effect to suspend the interlocutory judgment; and if the party taking such appeal, should take an appeal after final judgment, the latter appeal shall include the former, provided it be perfetced within twenty days after the day fixed by law for the adjournment of the term at which such final judgment is rendered; or, such party may, within said twenty days, perfect his appeal from such interlocutory judgment alone.

SEC. 908.  An appeal from a final judgment may be taken within two years after the same was rendered, but not after; provided that an appeal may be taken by infants persons or unsound mind, and persons imprisoned on execution under the sentence of a Court, for a term less than for life within one year after the removal of such disability; and in case of the death of such person within the time allowed, the appeal may be taken by his representative.

An appeal is said to be perfected, when proof of notice on the adverse party or his attorney of record, together with the bond required, and the instrument (where one is necessary under Article 904) have been duly filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court in which judgment was rendered.

SEC. 912.  When a suspensive appeal is perfected, it stays all further proceedings in the Court below, upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter embraced therein; but the Court below may proceed upon any other matter included in the suit, and not affected by the judgment appealed from.

SEC. 913.  Where execution shall have been issued before the perfecting of a suspensive appeal, it shall be the duty of the Clerk to deliver a written notice thereof to the Sheriff or other officer; or to mail it to such Sheriff or other officer, if the execution shall have been issued to another county; or, if the party request it, the notice may be delivered to him, to be served on the Sheriff or other officer, by any disinterested person.

SEC. 1049.  The property reserved from forced sale by Article 717, does not form any part of the estate of a deceased person, where a constituent of the family survives.

SEC. 1050.  When a person dies, the estate vests in the persons entitled under the law regulating wills, and the descent and distribution of estates; but, upon the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, the executor or administrator becomes entitled to the possession of it, for the purpose of administration; and for that purpose only.

SEC. 1051.  A person is deemed to die, or to be dead, or deceased, within the meaning of this Part of this Code, 
1.   When he dies or is dead, in the ordinary sense.
2.   When he is a convict under sentence of imprisonment for life.

SEC. 1052.  No absence for any length of time, without being heard from will authorize an administration to be commenced on the estate of such absentee.

SEC. 1053.  The object of administration is, 
1.	To apply as much of the estate as may be necessary to the payment of the debts of the deceased.
2.	To distribute the estate, or the balance after the payment of debts, to the persons entitled to receive it.
3.	To preserve the estate; and if there be no creditors, or if after the payment of creditors, there be no person present in person or by attorney who is entitled to receive it, to preserve it until such person appear.

SEC. 1054.  It follows from the preceding Article, that if the persons entitled to receive the estate be present, and can agree as to the distribution thereof, and there no creditors, there is no necessity for administration.

SEC. 1055.  Incidental to administration is the recovery of the possession of the property, and partition between the estate and other part owners.

SEC. 1056.  Administration is effected by the aid of, 
1.	An executor appointed by the last will of the deceased and confirmed by the Court.
2.	An administrator appointed by the Court on application therefor.

SEC. 1057.  Where the wife dies, her husband surviving, administration is unnecessary, except as to any separate estate which may have belonged to her.  The husband continues to have the same power of disposition over the community property, which he possessed during the continuance of the marriage.  But he shall be required, on application of any one interested in the community, to return an inventory and appraisement of all such property, and to file a bond signed by one or more sureties, to be approved by and payable to the Chief Justice of the County, in an amount equal to the value of the whole of the community property, to the effect that he will faithfully administer the same and pay over one half of the surplus after the payment of the debts with which the whole is property chargeable, to such person or persons as shall be entitled to receive.

SEC. 1058.  The husband, in such case, is liable to be called to account at any time after one year form the date of the bond.

SEC. 1059.  Such bond is sueable, recoverable and in every other respect the same as the bond of an administrator.

SEC. 1060.  Where the husband or wife dies, intestate, leaving no child or children, and no separate estate, the common property passes to the survivor, charged with the debts of the community, and no administration is required.

SEC. 1061.  The distributees only of an estate are said to be “interested in the estate;” the distributes, creditors and the executor or administrator, are said to bes “intereted in the administration.”

SEC. 1062.  A distributee of an estate is one who is entitled to receive the whole or a part thereof, after the payment of the debts and compliance with all other obligations not created by will.  The term distributee includes legatees and devisees.

SEC. 1063.  The order of Court confirming the appointment of the executor, and the entry made during term or in vacation, of the fact that such executor has given bond and taken the oath, are called granting letters testamentary.

SEC. 1065.  When any thing is prescribed with reference to “the original grant of letters testamentary or of administration,” it refers to the time when an executor or administrator of the estate first gave bond and took the oath.  And if the word “original” be omitted, it refers to the time when the present executor or administrator gave bond and took the oath.

Chapter II. Of the time of commencing the administration of estates, and of the continuance thereof.

SEC. 1066.  The administration of an estate must be commenced within four years after the decease of the testator or intestate, and not after.

SEC. 1067.  The presumption is, after that time has elapsed, that there were no debts, or if any, that they are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the property if any, has gone into the possession of the person entitled to receive it.  If the contrary be the fact, either the creditor or the heir, or the State, if there be no heir, has a remedy in the District Court.

SEC. 1068.  But where letters testamentary or of administration shall have once been granted, no presumption is admissible, which is contrary to the record; and the persons interested in the administration may proceed after any lapse of time, to compel a settlement of an estate, which does not appear from the record, to have been closed.

Chapter III. Of the parties to administration.

SECTION 1 Who is entitled to Administer.

SEC. 1071.  Where a person named as executor in a will, shall have renounced, he shall not be afterward appointed administrator of the same estate.  An executor is said to renounce when, being present or cited, he fails to claim letters testamentary.

SEC. 1072.  Where the husband appoints an executor or executors, and there is any community property, the surviving wife shall nevertheless have letters of administration as to the community property; and she and the executor or executors shall administer the same jointly, except that the power of the wife shall be equal to that of the executors, as to the community property.

SEC. 1075.  Where one who is under twenty-one years of age at the time of proving the will, has been appointed executor, and has not qualified, he is entitled after coming of age, to demand letters testamentary, and a revocation of any letters of administration which may have been granted.

SEC. 1076.  An executor of an executor shall not, in consequence thereof, be executor of the first testator.

SEC. 1077.  Where a person named as executor was absent from the State, or confined by sickness, when the testator died, or when the will was proved, or had not actual notice of the appointment, whereby he was prevented from presenting the will for proof, within thirty days after the death of the testator, or from accepting and qualifying within twenty days after the proof of the will, he shall be allowed to accept and qualify as executor, at any time within sixty days after his return to the State, or his recovery from sickness, or notice of his appointment; and if in the meantime letters of administration have been granted to any other person, they shall be revoked.

SEC. 1078.  Where letters of administration shall have been granted, and it shall afterwards be discovered that the deceased left a lawful will, if such will be proved in the manner provided in this Act, and an executor be named therein, he shall be entitled to demand letters testamentary, and a revocation of the previous letters of administration.

SEC. 1079.  When a will of a person not a resident of this State at the time of his death, has been admitted to probate in any State or Territory of the United States, or in the District of Columbia, or in any other country, and the executor named in such will, has qualified, such executor or either of them, may file a copy of such will and of the probate thereof, and demand letters testamentary thereon, and the revocation of any letters of administration which may have been previously granted.  Bond shall be required in all such cases notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the will.

SEC. 1080.  Where letters of administration have been granted to one, and other whose right is prior, makes application therefor, the letters shall be revoked, and granted to the person thus entitled.

SECTION 2 Where there is a contest about a will or the right to administer

SEC. 1081.  If the validity of a will, or the right to letters testamentary or of administration be contested, the Court shall without delay decide in favor of what appears to be the right of the case.  If an appeal be taken, or a certiorari and supersedeas be obtained, the person in whose favor the decision is made shall, notwithstanding, qualify and receive letters testamentary or of administration, as the ease may be.

SEC. 1082.  But if on appeal or certiorari by one of the applicants, the decision be that the person appealing or obtaining the certiorari was entitled in preference to the person appointed, he shall recover from the latter and his sureties, after citation in the County Court, all the fees which the latter may have received as executor or administrator.

SECTION 3 Of other parties to administration.
SEC. 1083.  All persons who are interested in the administration are necessary parties thereto.

SEC. 1084.  It follows that any person who is interested in the administration, can appear in his own right, and contest any proceeding which he deems prejudicial to his interest, or institute any proceeding which he deems necessary to protect his interest, unless it be a proceeding in which the distributees only are interested.

SEC. 1166.  Where one of the parts is the homestead and a sale takes place, the proceeds are to be held, or disposed of by the Court, in the manner provided by Articles 724 and 725 of this Code.

Chapter X. Of general mode of administering estates.

SECTION 1 Of the general power and duties of executors or administrators, as to the property of estates.

SEC. 1168.  The personal property, except slaves, passes to the executor or administrator, to be disposed of as provided in Articles 1186, 1190 and 1191, unless otherwise ordered by the Court; and a sale of such property cannot be attacked, except for fraud in the purchaser.

SEC. 1169.  Real property, and slaves on the other hand, merely pass to the possession of the executor or administrator, to be preserved and hired or rented as provided in Articles 1174, 1175 and 1176, to be sold by order of Court, if necessary for the payment of debts under Article 278. and if not required to be sold for the payment of debts, to be distributed or delivered up to the persons entitled to the remainder of the estate.

SEC. 1170.  It follows from the preceding Article, that executors and administrators may sue and be sued for the possession of real property or slaves, but that the title to such property cannot be affected by any suit, to which the persons entitled to receive the remainder of the estate are not parties.

SEC. 1171.  The power of the executor over the testator’s estate, before grant of letter testamentary, shall extend to the burial of the deceased, in a manner suitable to his condition, the payment of the necessary funeral expenses, and the taking care of the estate; and, if the will be rejected; or if the Court decide that such person is disqualified to act as executor, or if he never qualify as executor, he shall not be liable as an executor of his own wrong, unless he refuse to deliver up the estate to the person authorized to receive the same; but shall in all cases be liable for waste or mismanagement.

SEC. 1172.  It is the duty of the executor or administrator, to take care of the property, real and personal, of the estate, as a prudent man would take care of his own property; and, if there be any buildings belonging to the estate, it shall be his duty to keep the same in tenantable repair, extraordinary casualties excepted.

SEC. 1173.  All reasonable expenses incurred by the executor or administrator, in making such repairs, on sufficient proof thereof, shall be allowed by the Court.

SEC. 1174.  If there be slaves belonging to an estate, which are not attached to a plantation or manufactory, and it be not necessary to sell them at once for the payment of debts, and no other disposition of them directed to be made by the will, it shall be the duty of the executor or administrator to hire them to a responsible person or persons, for the best price that can be obtained, having in view their proper treatment.

SEC. 1175.  If there be a plantation and slaves, or a manufactory and slaves belonging to the estate, and the disposition thereof be not specially directed by will, and if the same be not required to be at once sold for the payment of debts, it shall be the duty of the executor or administrator to carry on such plantation or manufactory, or rent the same and hire out the slaves, as shall appear to him to be most for the interest of the estate.  In coming to a determination he shall take into consideration the condition of the estate, and the necessity that may exist for future sale of such property for the payment of claims or legacies, and shall not extend the time of renting or hiring any of the property beyond what may consist with the speedy settlement of the estate.  And any one who is interested in the estate, may upon good cause shown, after citation to the executor or administrator, obtain an order controlling his action in this particular.

SEC. 1176.  If there be other improved real property belonging to the estate, the executor or administrator shall lease it, subject to the necessities of the administration; and so, of any real property, that may produce an income, except by the cutting of timber.

SEC. 1177.  If the deceased has left a crop ungathered or in an unfinished state, so that the estate would suffer loss from the want of additional labor, the executor or administrator may procure such labor to be performed as may be indispensable to the saving of such crop; and all sums of money paid for any such labor, if approved by the Court shall be allowed as expenses of administration.

SEC. 1178.  The executor or administrator is not allowed to take any of the property of the estate at its appraised value, but is responsible for the appraised value, unless he show that it was sold for a less amount lawfully and in good faith.

SEC. 1179.  The executor or administrator shall use such diligence as a prudent man would use were it his own property, to collect every claim due to the estate, and to recover the possession of all property to which the state hath a right, provided there is a reasonable prospect that such claim can be collected or such property recovered; and in default thereof, he and his sureties are liable for the amount of the claim and value of the property lost by his neglect.

SECTION 2 Where there are directions in a will, as to the administration of the estate.

SEC. 1180.  Directions in a will for the management of the estate, or part thereof, of for the sale of property, must be confirmed by an order of the Court, before the executor or administrator will be authorized, as against creditors and forced heirs, to pursue the same, where they differ from the mode of administration prescribed by this Part of this Code.

SEC. 1181.  Where there are such directions in a will, notice shall be given by citation published at least once a week for four weeks successively, or if there be no newspaper printed regularly in the county, by citation duly posted, to all persons interested in the administration, and by citation duly served on the forced heirs of the deceased, if any, to appear and show cause why such directions should not be pursued.

SEC. 1182.  At the trial, if it appear that the estate is solvent, and that the directions of the will, will not materially delay the creditors, any objections made by creditors shall be disregarded; and if there be no forced heirs, or if they do not object, or if the directions can be pursued without diminishing, or incumbering the portion of the forced heirs, an order shall be made confirming the directions in the will, and the estate shall be administered accordingly; otherwise an order shall be made either wholly annulling the directions of the will, or confirming the directions therein to one quarter of the residue of the estate, after the payment of debts and discharge of all obligations not created by the will itself.

SEC. 1183.  A testator may direct by his will, that no action be had in the County Court in the administration of his estate, except,
1.	To prove and record the will.
2.	To prove and record the will and return an inventory and appraisement of the estate.
3.	He may direct that the person named as his executor shall not be required to give bond.
4.	If the direction contained in the third subdivision of this Article, be not expressed, the direction contained in the first or second, shall not exempt the executor rom giving bond as in other cases.
5.	If the will merely direct that no administration be had on the estate, it shall be construed to mean no administration except to prove and record the will.

SEC. 1184.  Objection cannot be made by a forced heir or creditor, to any direction mentioned in the preceding Article, except as to the bond; and such objection when made by a creditor or creditors, may be obviated in the manner provided by Articles 1115 and 1116.

SEC. 1185.  When a will contains directions that no action be had in the County Court in the administration of the estate, except to prove and record the same, or to prove and record it and return an inventory and appraisement, no other provisions of this Part of this Code, except as declared in subdivision four of Article 1183, shall apply to such estate; but the same shall become like any other property to be administered under a power, chargeable in the hands of the trustee, and liable to execution in any Court having jurisdiction.

SECTION 3 All the personal property, except slaves to be sold, unless otherwise ordered by will.

SEC. 1186.  The executor or administrator, as soon as practicable after the appraisement, shall sell at public sale all the personal property belonging to the estate, except slaves and specific legacies, and personal property necessary to carry on a plantation or manufactory, giving such credit as he may deem most advantageous to the estate, not exceeding six months, and taking notes with one or more sufficient sureties for the purchase money.

SEC. 1187.  If any testator direct his personal estate, or any part thereof, not to be sold, the same shall be reserved from sale, unless such sale be necessary for the payment of debts.

SEC. 1188.  The executor or administrator shall keep or cause to be kept a true account of the sales made, making a list thereof, specifying each article sold, the price for which it was sold, and the name of the purchaser, and shall annex to such list an affidavit, stating that it is a true account of the sales made by him at the time specified, and shall file it within thirty days after the sale.  Such accounts shall be recorded, after allowing one term for objections to be made thereto.

SEC. 1189.  The provisions of Chapter four, Title thirteen, of the second Part of this Code, commencing at Article 675, so far as the same relate to the advertisement and sale of personal property other than slaves, and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter, shall apply to the advertisement and sale of such property by an executor or administrator; the executor or administrator being substituted for the Sheriff, the estate for the debtor, and persons interested in the administration only for the creditor.

SEC. 1190.  The executor or administrator may sell any of the personal property of the estate, except slaves, at private sale, if it appear to him to be for the interest of the estate; but he shall be responsible for its being sold for a fair price, and shall make return of such sale within thirty days.

SEC. 1191.  If the executor or administrator shall represent to the Court on oath, that there is wild stock belonging to the estate which he is nanable to collect or command, the Court may order that the same be sold at public auction, without taking an inventory or making appraisement thereof, on such credit as the Court may deem reasonable, not exceeding six months, taking notes with good and sufficient security for the purchase money.

SEC. 1192.  Such sale shall be advertised, made, returned and confirmed the same as sales of real property and slaves

SECTION 4 Miscellaneous provisions respecting the duties and liabilities of the executor or administrator.

SEC. 1193.  The executor or administrator may cause an entry to be made on the record, that a certain person who resides in the county is his attorney, and as such authorized to transact for him all business of the administration, or the power may be for a limited purpose; and in such case, the attorney shall have power accordingly.

SEC. 1194.  If such power be general, all citations and notices required to be served on the executor or administrator, may be served on such attorney.  If it be limited, all citations and notices which relate to the business which the attorney is authorized to transact, may be served on him.

SEC. 1195.  Where there are several executors or administrators, a majority may do any act required to be done; but less than a majority cannot do any set except, 
1.	Reject a claim
2.	Any set which is for the advantage of the estate.
3.	Resist a wrong doer.
4.	Apply to the Court for an order to compel the other executor or administrator to join in doing an act which ought to be done.

SEC. 1196.  The preceding Article does not apply to any return, report or account which the executors or administrators are required to make, nor to any act which they are expressly ordered by the Court to perform; but the executor or administrator who fails or neglects to join or do a like act, liable, according to the circumstances of the case, be such neglect or failure.

SEC. 1197.  Where are several co-executors, one is not responsible for the acts of the others, unless they give a joint bond; but each is responsible for such assets as come to his hands, or are lost by his neglect.

SEC. 1199.  Where an executrix or administratrix is a married woman she shall nevertheless act in the discharge of her duties as such, in all respects the same as if she were unmarried.

SEC. 1200.  The executor or administrator may, when he thinks it will be for the interest of the estate, receive property or other claims in payment of a debt due the estate; but he and his sureties will be required, if called to account for such debt, to prove that the receipt of the property or claim in payment thereof, was at the time a prudent exercise of the discretion hereby conferred.

SEC. 1201.  When a mortgagee dies, his executor or administrator, on receipt of the amount due on the mortgage, is authorized to release the mortgage.

SEC. 1202.  The executor or administrator shall account for any claim due from him to the testator or intestate, in the same manner as if it were so much money come into his hands since the commencement of the administration.

SEC. 1203.  If the executor or administrator, directly or indirectly, purchase any part of the estate, upon the application of any person interested in the administration, an order shall be made that such part shall be held in trust for the estate; and the executor or administrator shall only be entitled to retain in lieu thereof, the amount he shall prove to have been paid by him therefor.  This includes the purchase of claims.

SEC. 1204.  All interest received by the executor, or administrator, is assets in his hands; and if he lend the money of the estate, or use it for his private purposes, he shall be chargeable with interest thereon, to be compounded every six months.

SEC. 1205.  The Court shall exercise equitable control, in making the executor or administrator accountable for interest accruing to the estate; and for that purpose may take testimony and examine the executor or administrator on oath.

SEC. 1206.  When the deceased shall have made a contract for the purchase of property, and died without having completed the payment, or provided by will for the completion thereof, or the will has been annulled under Article 1182, and the completion thereof would be beneficial to the estate, and not injurious to creditors, the executor or administrator may, by order of the Court, complete such payment out of the assets in his hands but if the Court should be of opinion, that after the payments debts, there will not be sufficient assets to pay for such property, the Court may order the executor or administrator to sell at public sale, all the right, title, interest and claim of the deceased in and to such property; to be sold in same manner as like property belonging wholly to the estate.

SEC. 1207.  The rights, powers, and duties of executors and administrators, shall be governed by the principles of the common law, where the same do not conflict with the provisions of this Act.

Chapter XI.  Of claims for money against estates.

SECTION 1 Of the exhibition and establishment of claims for money.

SEC. 1208.  Within fifteen days after filing bond and taking the oath, the executor or administrator, if such notice shall not have been previously given by a former executor or administrator, shall cause to be published in some newspaper regularly printed in the county, if there be one, a notice that all claims for money not presented to him for allowance within one year from a certain day (which shall be the day on which the filing of the bond and taking the oath were complete) will be postponed until the claims presented within that time are paid; and he shall also, within said time, cause the same notice to be posted in three of the most public places in the county, not within the same city or town, one of which shall be the Court-house door.  Such notice shall be published at least once a week for six successive weeks.

SEC. 1209.  If a newspaper be not regularly printed in the county, such notice shall be published in the newspaper printed (in the State) nearest the county seat of the county where the administration is pending, if there be one printed regularly within one hundred miles.  And, in such case the notice shall also be posted as prescribed in the preceding Article.

SEC. 1210.  If there be no newspaper printed regularly as often as once a week, in the State, within one hundred miles of the county seat of the county where administration is pending, such notice shall only be posted as prescribed in Article 1208.

SEC. 1211.  If the executor or administrator fail to cause notice to be given, as prescribed in the three preceding Articles, he shall be liable for any damage which any person may sustain by reason of the failure of such person to present his claim for allowance within the year, unless it appear that such person had notice of the death of the deceased.  If notice be published by one of several co-executors or co-administrators, it shall be sufficient.

SEC. 1212.  The term “within the year,” and “after the year,” as used in this Chapter, mean within or after a year from the original grant of letters testamentary or of administration.

SEC. 1213.  The provisions of this Chapter apply only to claims for money; but they apply to claims for uncertain damages for injury or breach of contract, as well as to claims the amount of which are susceptible of being ascertained by calculation.

SEC. 1214.  The provisions of this Chapter do not apply to legacies or to claims acknowledged by will.  But a claim acknowledged by will, may be resisted by a creditor, and reduced to the class of a legacy, if proved not to have been really due.

SEC. 1215.  A claim is said to be “allowed” or “rejected” by the executor or administrator, and to be “approved” or “disapproved” by the Court; those terms referring, when used by the Court, to the claim and not to the action of the administrator.

SEC. 1216.  The executor or administrator shall not allow, and the Court shall not approve any claim, unless it be accompanied by an affidavit of the claimant, “that nothing has been paid or delivered towards the satisfaction of such claim, except what is mentioned or credited, (if any,) that there are no counter-claims known to affiant, which have not been allowed, (if any,) and that the sum claimed is justly due.”

SEC. 1217.  Where the claim is not founded on an instrument in writing or an account, in addition to the statements required by the preceding Article, the affidavit must state the facts on which the claim is founded.

SEC. 1218.  Where a claim belongs to a corporation, the cashier, treasurer or managing agent, shall make the affidavit required to authenticate it.

SEC. 1219.  When an affidavit is made by an officer of a corporation, executor, administrator, trustee, assignee, or attorney, it shall be sufficient to state in such affidavit, “that he has made diligent enquiry and examination, and that he does verily believe that nothing has been paid or delivered towards the satisfaction of such claims, except the amount credited, (if any,) that there are no counter-claims which have not been allowed, (if any,) and that the sum claimed is justly due,”

SEC. 1220.  Where a claim is assigned after the decease of the debtor, the affidavit shall be made by the person who held the debt at the death of the debtor, as well as by the assignee.

SEC. 1221.  A claim which the executor or administrator held against the deceased at the time of his death, or which has since accrued under the second subdivision of Article 1247, is exhibited by being filed, verified by the affidavit of the executor or administrator; after which, it takes the same course as other claims.

SEC. 1222.  The provisions of Chapter six, Title fourteen, of the Second Part of this Code, commencing at Article 762, apply to affidavit to authenticate claims.

SEC. 1223.  The mode of presenting a claim to the executor or administrator is, 
1.	If it be founded upon an instrument in writing, by delivering to him a written statement of the amount claimed together with a copy of the instrument and of the affidavit required by Article 126, and exhibiting the original.
2.	If it be founded on an account, by delivering to him a copy of the account and of the affidavit required by Article 1216.
3.	If it be not founded on a written instrument or account, by delivering to him a copy of the affidavit required by Articles 1216 and 1217, and exhibiting the original.
	When the affidavit is not made by the claimant, the affidavit under Article 1219 is substituted for the one under 1216; and if the claim has been assigned since the decease of the debtor, the affidavit mentioned in Article 1220 must accompany either of the others.

SEC. 1224.  When a claim is presented to the executor or administrator, authenticated in the manner prescribed in Articles 1216, 1217, 1219, or 1220, he shall endorse thereon, or annex thereto, a memorandum in writing signed by him, stating the time of its presentment, and that he allows or rejects it, or what portion thereof he allows, if any.

SEC. 1225.  The failure or refusal of an executor or administrator to endorse on or annex to, any claim presented to him, his allowance or rejection thereof, shall be deemed to be a rejection; and in such case, the costs, if the claim be established, shall be adjudged against the executor or administrator, to be paid out of his own estate.

SEC. 1226.  A rejection by one of several executors or administrators, is a rejection of the claim; and, where there are several executors or administrators, the claim is rejected, if it be not allowed by a majority.

SEC. 1227.  After a claim has been presented to the executor or administrator, and allowed or rejected, the claimant shall file it.

SEC. 1228.  When a claim, or part thereof has been rejected, the claimant, if he do not submit thereto, shall cause the executor or administrator to be cited to appear at the next term of the Court, and show cause why it should not be approved.

SEC. 1229.  At each term of the Court, all claims which have been allowed and filed shall be examined, and approved or disapproved by an order duly entered; and whether a claim is approved or not, the order shall assign to it its proper class.

SEC. 1230.  At each term of the Court, in like manner, all claims which the executor or administrator shall have been cited to answer, shall be examined, and approved or disapproved, and classed.

SEC. 1231.  When the executor or administrator is cited to show cause why a claim should not be approved, the endorsement thereon or annexed thereto, of its rejection, shall be taken to be true without proof, unless it be denied under oath.

SEC. 1232.  Any person interested in the administration, may appear and contest any of the claims, and shall be entitled to process to compel the attendance of witnesses, as in ordinary suits in the District Courts.

SEC. 1233.  Although a claim be properly authenticated and allowed, if the Court be not well satisfied that it is just, it shall send for persons and papers, and may examine the claimant and the executor or administrator under oath.  The same examination may be made where the claim has not been allowed.  If the Court be not entirely convinced, in such case, by evidence other than the testimony of the claimant, that the claim is just, it shall be disapproved.

SEC. 1234.  The order of approval or disapproval of a claim, has the force and effect of a judgment.

SEC. 1235.  A claim is said to be legally exhibited, 
1.	When it is properly presented to the executor or administrator, and after being allowed by him is filed; or,
2.	After being rejected by him is filed, and the executor or administrator cited to answer it; or,
3.	Without being presented to the administrator, is duly authenticated and filed, and the executor or administrator cited to answer it.  Provided, in any case, that if a claim be disapproved, an appeal has been taken or certiorari obtained.

SEC. 1236.  A claim is said to be established, when it has been allowed by the executor or administrator, and approved by the Court; or when it has been approved by the Court, after citation to the executor or administrator to appear and answer it; or when, on appeal or certiorari by the claimant, it has been sustained by the District Court; or when, on appeal or certiorari by any person interested in the administration, it has been sustained by the District Court, or the appeal or certiorari has been dismissed.

SEC. 1237.  It is the duty of the executor or administrator to report to the Court a list of all judgment and special liens, whether presented to him for allowance or not; and in like manner, all suits for money pending against the deceased at the time of his death.

SEC. 1238.  The executor or administrator, or any person interested in the administration, or the Court of Re OW motion, may cause any person who claims a judgment or recorded special lien against the estate, to be cited to appear and establish the same.  And on return of such citation duly served, such claim shall be supported by affidavit and approved or disapproved, according to the evidence, like other claims.

SEC. 1239.  Any such claimant, who, when cited to appear and establish his claim, fails to do so, shall be deemed to admit that the same is not just, or that it has been paid, and shall be forever barred from prosecuting the same; and judgment shall be entered to that effect.  The clamint retains, however, his right to appeal or obtain a writ of certiorari.

SEC. 1240.  Claims which have not been legally exhibited within the year, may be exhibited at any time afterwards, before the estate is closed, or suit on such claims would be barred by the general law of limitations.

SEC. 1241.  The general law of limitations is interrupted.
1.	By filing a claim which has been allowed.
2.	By filing a claim, and causing a citation to be issued to the executor or administrator.

SEC. 1242.  Where a claim is lost or cannot be produced, the claimant may make an affidavit of the facts and present it to the administrator, or cause it to be be filed, with the same effect as the claim itself; but, in such case, the claim must be proved by disinterested testimony produced in Court or taken by deposition, before it shall be approved.

SEC. 1243.  Where, by reason of a claim being a claim against another person, or other like sufficient cause, it is inconvenient for a claimant to permit the same to remain on file, the Court may, after such claim shall have been approved, order a copy thereof to be retained and the original to be delivered to the claimant or his attorney.

SEC. 1244.  If any person shall bring a suit for money against an executor or administrator, in the District Court, in any case not provided for by Article 17, he shall pay all the costs of the suit.

SEC. 1245.  A docket shall be kept which shall be known as the Claim Docket.  It shall be ruled at proper intervals from top to bottom, with a short note of the contents at the top of each column.  One or more pages shall be assigned to each estate, in proportion to the probable number of claims which will be exhibited against it.  In the marginal column shall be entered the names of the claimants, in the order in which their claims are filed, and when they are filed.  The second column shall contain the amount of the claim; the third, the date form which it bears interest; the fourth, the rate of interest; the fifth, whether allowed or rejected, in whole or in part, by the executor or administrator; the sixth, date of filing; seventh, whether approved or disapproved, in whole or in part; eighth, the class to which the claim belongs; ninth, appeal, and by whom, with date; tenth, certiorari, by whom obtained, and date; eleventh, established in the District Court.  When the entry is of any act in Court, the docket and page shall be stated.  An index shall be kept showing the names of the decease persons, and the page on which the abstract of claims against them will be found.

SECTION 2  Of the classification of Claims and the order in which they shall be paid.

SEC. 1246.  The claims against an estate shall be classed and have priority of payment as follows, except as provided in Article 1248.  
1.	Funeral expenses.
2.	Expenses of last sickness, including medicines.
3.	Special liens, according to their priority, so far as the same can be paid out of the specific property to which the lien attached.
4.	Wages of white servants not earned during lasts ickness.
5.	Medical attendance during last sickness.
6.	Judgments rendered against the deceased in his lifetime, which are liens on the real property of the estate, according to their priority, so far as the same can be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of such real property.
7.	All claims legally exhibited within one year.
8.	All claims and parts of claims not paid under some one of the preceding subdivisions of this Article.
Where there is a deficiency of assests to pay all claims of the same degree, they shall be paid pro rata.

SEC. 1247.  The expenses of administration are:
1.	The costs of Court.
2.	Reasonable expenses incurred by the executor or administrator in the collection, preservation and management of the estate, including reasonable attorney’s fees, where the executor or administrator is not a practicing attorney, and the service was necessary and actually rendered.
3.	Commissions to the executor or administrator, at the rate of five per cent on all sums actually received by him in cash, and five per cent on all sums actually received by him in cash, and five per cent on all sums paid to creditors, and legatees or to the State Treasurer; but not on the remainder of the estate, delivered up to the persons entitled to receive the same, unless a sale become necessary in order to make distribution.

SEC. 1248.  The expenses or administration, have priority of all charges except funeral expenses, subject however, to this explanation, that the expenses of administration as to a particular class of charges and the property to be applied to the payment thereof, have priority over that and subsequent classes, but are postponed to prior classes.

SEC. 1249.  The attorney fees which are allowable as part of the expenses of administration, are those only which were for services in a controversy or controversies between the estate and other persons, and do not include fees for advice or assistance in administering the estate, where there is no such controversy.  There may be a controversy without a suit.

SEC. 1250.  Where the judgment of the Court is appealed from, or taken to the District Court within the year by certiorari, by the claimant, if the claim be established in that Court, it retains its proper class, and on receipt of a certified copy of the judgment, the same shall be entered of record and observed accordingly.

SEC. 1251.  Where the judgment of the Court is appealed from or a certiorari is taken to the District Court, at any time before a claim is paid, by the executor or administrator, or any one interested in the administration, the payment shall not be made until a certified copy of the judgment of the District Court, establishing the same, or dismissing the appeal or certiorari, shall have been received and entered of record; but the claim if finally established retains its proper class.

SEC. 1252.  All suits pending against any person at the time of his death, which, by law, survive against his executor or administrator, shall be considered claims legally exhibited against such estate, from the time such suit shall be revived; and shall be classed accordingly.

SEC. 1253.  The allowance and filing of a claim without the affidavit prescribed in Article 1216 or 1217, if done in good faith, has the effect to prevent the claim from being postponed under Article 2246, or barred by the general law of limitations.

SEC. 1254. All claims except legacies, and claims acknowledged by will or included in subdivisions one and three of Article 1247, must be legally exhibited against the estate; and are classed accordingly, subject to Articles 1252 and 1256.

SEC. 1255.  A claim which in its nature belongs to the first, second, fourth or fifth class, becomes postponed, if it be not legally exhibited within the year.

SEC. 1256.  Claims which belong to the sixth class, and recorded liens and liens preserved by possession, which belong to the third class, retain their priority as to the property to which they attach, although they be not legally exhibited within the year.

SEC. 1257.  But, as to all property, the claims mentioned in the preceding Article stand upon the same footing as claims in the seventh and eighth classes.

SEC. 1258.  It is the duty of the Court, when there are any funds which should properly be applied to claims mentioned in Article 1256, which have not been legally exhibited, to cite the claimants to appear and establish or abandon them.

SECTION 3 Of the payment of claims against estates.

SEC. 1259.  The executor or administrator shall pay the claims mentioned in subdivisions one, two, four and five, of Article 1246, according to their priority, whenever he has funds of the estate; and if he fail to do so, the creditor, after notice to the executor or administrator, shall be entitled to an order for such payment.

SEC. 1260.  It shall be the duty of the executor or administrator, at the first term of the Court after the expiration of one year from the original grant of letters of administration, to return an account showing – 
1.	Any property that may have come to his knowledge or possession by discovery, increase or otherwise, belonging to the estate, which has not been previously inventoried.
2.	Any changes in the property of the estate, by sale destruction or otherwise, which have not been previously reported.
3.	Any judgments which are a lien on the real property of the estate, which have not been legally exhibited.
4.	Any recorded specific liens, which have not been legally exhibited.
5.	Any suits for money in the District Court, pending at the decease of the testator or intestate, and not yet decided; and whether revived, or not; and if revived, the date thereof.

1.	Whether there are funds enough in the hands of the executor or administrator to pay all claims which have been legally exhibited.
2.	If not, how many of the classes there are funds enough to pay in full, and the excess, if any, to be applied to the payment of the next class.

SEC. 1263.  If the enquiry be found in the affirmative, an order shall be made that the executor or administrator immediately pay all claims which have been established.

SEC. 1264.  If such enquiry be found in the negative, an order shall be made for the immediate payment of certain claims to be specified, which shall include all of each class which is to be paid in full; and, if there will be any surplus after such payment, the order shall fix the per centage which each claim of the next class is entitled to at that time, and shall order the same to be paid immediately.  In making the order required by this Article, regard shall be had to the fact, that the third and sixth classes have priority over the seventh and eighth as to the proceeds of the particular property only; and the amount apportioned for claims which remain on file undecided, or on appeal or certiorari, shall be reserved until such claims are decided.

SEC. 1265.  Proceedings similar to those prescribed by the three preceding Articles shall be had at any subsequent term of the Court, when there are any funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, and any established claims unpaid.

SEC. 1266.  No claim against an estate shall be paid until it shall have been established in the manner provided by the first Section of this Chapter.

SEC. 1269.  Such citation may be issued to any country in the State; and upon the return thereof, duly served, if good cause to the contrary be not shown, the Court shall render judgment against the sureties for, the amount of the claim ordered to be paid as aforesaid and remaining unpaid, and ten per cent damages thereon, together with interest and costs; and issue execution thereon.

SEC. 1270.  At any time after the first term after the year, any person interested in the administration may cause the executor or administrator to be cited to return additional accounts similar to the one mentioned in Article 1261; but if it do not appear that there was good cause therefor, such person shall pay the costs.

SEC. 1271.

Chapter XII. Of claims against estates other than for money, and of other controversies.

SEC. 1272.  When the deceased shall have entered into any contract for the conveyance of real property or slaves, which was not executed during his lifetime, and shall not have given power by will to carry the same into execution, or such power has been annulled under Article 1180, the party wishing a specific performance must bring his suit in the District Court, and make the heirs and executor or administrator parties thereto.

SEC. 1273.  If any person desire to contest the title of the estate to land or slaves, he must bring his suit in the District Court, and make the executor, or administrator and the heirs parties thereto.

SEC. 1274.  If any person desire to obtain the possession, merely, of real property or slaves, or to recover other personal property, it is sufficient to make the executor or administrator a party.  But the title to land or slaves cannot be affected by a recovery in such suit.

SEC. 1275.  If the executor or administrator desire to recover possession merely, of real property or slaves belonging to the estate, or to recover personal property other than slaves, he must bring suit in the District Court, but need not make the heirs parties.  The defendants in such suit may cause the heirs to be made parties, upon a showing under oath that they have a real and not merely a pretended claim to the property.

SEC. 1276.  The county Court has the power, by summary process, to put the executor or administrator in the possession of all property, both real and personal, which was in the possession of the deceased at the time of his death.

SEC. 1277.  If the executor or administrator deems it important for the benefit of the estate, not merely to obtain the possession of real property or slaves, but to settle the title thereto, he must bring suit in the District Court, and make the adverse claimants and the heirs defendants.

Chapter XIII.  Sales of real property and slaves for the payment of debts or legacies.

SEC. 1278.  Whenever it shall appear that the personal property or proceeds of previous sales, are insufficient to pay the claims of creditors and legatees, and expenses of administration, an order shall be made, on the application of the executor or administrator, or of any person interested in the administration, for the sale of enough real property or slaves, to supply the probable decfiency.

SEC. 1279.  Such sale shall be ordered to be made of the property which may be deemed most advantageous to the estate to be sold; provided, however, that slaves shall not be sold until all other property has been exhausted, unless it be manifest that the estate is insolvent, or it be necessary to sell one or more of them in satisfaction of a special lien.

SEC. 1282.  It is the duty of the executor or administrator to apply for such order, whenever it appears that the proceeds of the personal property and previous sales of real property, or slaves, will be insufficient to pay the debts and legacies and expenses of administration.

SEC. 1283.  Any person holding a claim against the estate, secured by mortgage or other special lien, may obtain an order for the sale of the property upon which he has such mortgage or other special lien, or so much thereof as may be required to satisfy the claim, by causing citation to be posted, and the executor or administrator to be cited to appear at the next term of the Court and show cause why such order should not be made.

SEC. 1284.  If it should appear to the Court that the discharge of such special lien, out of the general assets, would be beneficial to the estate, the payment may be ordered to be so made, instead of ordering a sale of the property.

Before any order for the sale of real property shall be entered, the executor or administrator shall be required to give a bond, with one or more sufficient sureties, payable to, and approved by the Chief Justice, in double the appraised value of the property, to the effect that he will faithfully discharge his duties as executor or administrator in making the sale, and collecting the purchase money, and that he will pay the same, when collected, according to the order of the Court.

SEC. 1286.  All sales of real property or slaves, for the payment of debts, shall be made on a credit of six months, except where such sales are ordered for the satisfaction of a mortgage or other lien on the very property: in which case, such sales shall be made on such terms as the Court may direct, which shall be stated in the order of sale.

SEC. 1287.  All sales of real property or slaves shall be made in the county where the administration is pending, unless the real property is situated, or the slaves were left by the deceased and are staying, in another county; in which case, the Court may order the sale to take place in such county.  And in all such cases, the sale shall be advertised in both counties.

SEC. 1288.  The order of sale shall require the sales to be made at the next regular sale day, allowing time for the advertisement.

SEC. 1295.  If, from any cause, the executor or administrator should fail to sell any real property or slaves, ordered to be sold, at the time specified in the order, he shall report the facts to the Court, accompanied by his affidavit of the truth thereof; and the Court may appoint another day for such sale; and so on, from time to time, until the property is disposed of.

SEC. 23.  Any one or more of the transfers in a chain of title or color of title, may be voidable; but none of them must be void, and in no case shall a patent from the Republic or State of Texas be deemed to be void, within the meaning of this Article.

SECTION 2 Time of commencing suit, where relation of landlord and tenant or vendor and vendee exists.

SEC. 32.  Whenever the relation of landlord and tenant shall have existed between any persons, a suit to recover the property may be commenced by the landlord and those claiming under him, at any time within ten years after the termination of the tenancy; or where there has been no written lease, within ten years from the time of the last payment of rent; notwithstanding that such tenant may have acquired another title, or may have claimed to hold adversely to his landlord; but such suit cannot be brought after the period herein limited.

SEC. 33.  There is no limit within which a suit for a specific performance must be brought by a vendee against his vendor, under an agreement in writing to convey, 
1.	Where the vendee has entered  into and continued in possession nnder the contract; or,
2.	Where the vendee has paid the purchase money according to the terms of the contract, or in payments which have been accepted.

SEC. 34.  In all cases not provided for in the preceding Article, the question whether a specific performance ought to be decreed shall depend upon the equality of the case, taking into consideration the terms of the agreement, the situation of the parties, the laches or diligence of the parties, and all equitable considerations which are usually considered in Courts of Equity, in determining the question of specific performance; but where the equity of the case is clearly on the side of the vendee, lapse of time of itself cannot defeat the suit.
SEC. 35.  A suit by the vendor to recover back the land on the ground that the purchase money has not been paid, where there was only an agreement to convey, may be commenced at any time, without limit, unless the vendee take possession and give notice to the vendor that he claims adversely to him; in which case the suit may be brought within five years from the date of the notice of adverse possession, but not afterwards.

SEC. 38.  Those who possess for others, and not in their own name, cannot plead limitation; but the possession of the former is the possession of the latter.

SEC. 39.  Where possession of personal property shall have commenced in the name of another, it cannot be changed except by proving that the real owner had knowledge of the adverse possession.

Chapter IV. General provisions as to the time of commencing suits to recover real and personal property, other than money.

SEC. 40.  The actual possessor, when he proves that he has formerly been in possession, shall be presumed also to have been in possession in the intermediate time, until the contrary is shown.

SEC. 41.  The possessor is allowed to make the sum of possession necessary to avail in a plea of limitation, by adding to his own possession that of the persons from whom he derives his right, in whatever manner he may have succeeded him.  Thus the possession of the heir may be joined to that of the ancestor, and the possession of the buyer to that of the seller.  But to enjoy this advantage, the different possessions must have succeeded each other without interval or interruption.  Nor can the period of limitation under one Article of this Title be added to the period of limitation under another.

SEC. 42.  An interval or interruption of less than three months shall not defeat a plea of limitation under the preceding Article, nor under Articles 15 and 25, provided there be a general residence, and not merely periodical visits with a view to claim the benefit of limitation.
