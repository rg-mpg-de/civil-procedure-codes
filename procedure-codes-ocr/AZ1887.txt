the facts found by the jury, that the will was duly executed, and that the

property and its value; and the judge must, at the same time, cause a notice
to be issued to the executor or administrator, requiring his appearance on
the return of the citation, and on its return he may examine the sureties and
such witnesses as may be produced, touching the property of the sureties
and its value; and if upon such examination he is satisfied that the bond is insufiicient, he must require sufficient additional security. ~


SEC. 78. If sufficient security is not given within the time fixed
by the judge's order, the right of such executor or administrator to the
administration shall cease, and the person next entitled to the administration
-on the estate who will execute a sufficient bond, must be appointed to the
administration.

the court or judge may order.

the judge may, by order, suspend his powers until the matter can be heard
and determined.


SEC. 85. When it comes to his knowledge that the bond of any
executor or administrator is, from any cause, insufficient, the probate judge,
without any application, must cause him to be cited to appear and show
cause why he should not give further security, and must proceed thereon as

from the territory or if he cannot be found, after due diligence and inquiry,
service may be made as provided in section eighty-one.


SEC. 87. If new sureties be given to the satisfaction of the judge,
he may thereupon make an order that the sureties who applied for relief shall
not be liable on their bond for any subsequent act, default "or misconduct of
the executor or administrator. ‘ ..

give new sureties, to the satisfaction of the judge, on the return of the

court or judge must, by order, revoke his letters.

or is about to commit a fraud upon the estate, or is incompetent to act, or
has permanently removed from the territory, or has wrongfully neglected the

CHAPTER FOUR.

INVENTORY AND COLLECTION OF THE EFFECTS OF DECEDENTS.

ARTICLE I.

INVENTORY, APPRAISEMENT, AND POSSESSION OF ESTATE.


SEC. 114. Every executor or administrator must make and return
to the court, at its first term after his appointment, a true inventory and appraisement of all the estate of the decedent, including the homestead, if any,
which has come to his possession or knowledge.


SEC. 115. To make the appraisement, the probate judge or court
must appoint three disinterested persons (any two of whom may act), who
are entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their services. not to
exceed three dollars .per day, to be allowed by the court or judge. The appraisers must with the inventory his a verified account of their services and
disbursements. If only one day's services are charged, the bill need not be
sworn to. If any part of the estate is in any other county than that in which
letters issued, appraisers thereof may be appointed, either by the probate
judge having jurisdiction of the estate or by the probate judge of such other
county, on request of the judge having jurisdiction.


SEC. 116. Before proceeding to the execution of their duty, the
appraisers, before any oiiicer authorized to administer oaths, must take and
subscribe an oath, to be attached to the inventory, that they will truly, honestly and impartially appraise the property which is exhibited to them, according to the best of their knowledge and ability. They must then
proceed to estimate and appraise the property; each article must be set down
separately, with the value thereof in dollars and cents, in iigures, opposite
to the articles, respectively; the inventory must contain all the estate of the
decedent, real and personal, a statement of all debts, partnerships and other
interests, bonds, mortgages, notes and other securities for the payment of
money belonging to the decedent, specifying the name of the debtor in
each security, the date, the sum originally payable, the indorsements thereon (if any), with their dates, and the sum which, in the judgment of the appraiser, may be collected on each debt, interest or security; the inventory
must show, so far as the same can be ascertained by the executor or the administrator, what portion of the property is community property and what
portion is the separate property of the decedent.


SEC. 117. The inventory must also contain an account of all
moneys belonging to the decedent which have come to the hands of the executor or administrator; and if none, the fact must be so stated in the
inventory. If the whole estate consists of money, there need not be an
appraisement, but an inventory must be made and returned as in other
cases.


SEC. 118. The naming of a person as executor does not thereby
discharge him from any just claim which the testator has against him, but the
claim must be included in the inventory, and the executor is liable for the
same, as for so much money in his hands, when the debt or demand becomes
due.


SEC. 119. The discharge or bequest in a will, of any debt or demand of the testator against the executor named, or any other person, is not
valid against the creditors of the decedent, but is a specific bequest of the
debt or demand. It must be included in the inventory, and, if necessary,

applied in the payment of his debts. If not necessary for that purpose, it
must be paid in the same manner and proportion as other specific legacies.


SEC. 120. The inventory must be signed by the appraisers, and
the executor or administrator must take and subscribe an oath before an
oiiicer authorized to administer oaths, that the inventory contains a true
statement of all the estate of the decedent which has come to his knowledge
and possession, and particularly of all money belonging to the decedent, and
of all just claims of the decedent against the amant. The oath must be
indorsed upon or annexed to the inventory.


SEC. 121. If an executor or administrator neglects or refuses to
return the inventory within the time prescribed, or within such further time,
not exceeding two months, which the court or judge shall, for reasonable
cause, allow; the court may, upon notice, revoke the letters testamentary or
of administration, and the executor or administrator is liable on his bond for
any injury to the estate, or any person interested therein. arising from such
failure.


SEC. 122. Whenever property not mentioned in an inventory
that is made and filed, comes to the possession or knowledge of an executor
or administrator, he must cause the same to be appraised in the manner prescribed in this article, and an inventory thereof to be returned within two
months after the discovery; and the making of such inventory may be enforced, after notice, by attachment or removal from office.


SEC. 123. The executor or administrator is entitled to the possession of all the real and personal estate of the decedent, and to receive
the rents and profits of the real estate, until the estate is settled, or until delivered over by order of the probate court to the heirs or devisees; and must
keep in good tenantable repair all houses, buildings and fixtures thereon,
which are under his control. The heirs or devisees may themselves, or jointly
with the executor or administrator, maintain an action for the possession of
the real estate, or for the purpose of quieting the title to the same, against
any one except the executor or administrator. 
SEC. 124. Unless it satisfactorily appears to the probate court,
that the rents, issues and profits of the real estate for a longer period are
necessary to be received by the executor or administrator, wherewith to pay
the debts of the decedent; or that it will probably be necessary to sell the
real estate for the payment of such debts; at the end of ten months from
the first publication of the notice to creditors, the court must direct the
executor or administrator to deliver possession of all the real estate to the
heirs at law or devisees.

ARTICLE II.

EMBEZZLEMENT AND SURRENDER OF PROPERTY OF ESTATE.


SEC. 125. If any person, before the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, embezzles or alienates any of the moneys, goods,
chattels-or effects of a decedent, he is chargeable therewith and liable to an
action by the executor or administrator of the estate, for double the value of
the property so embezzled or alienated, to be recovered for the benefit of the
estate.


SEC. 126. If any executor, administrator or any other person interested in the estate of a decedent complains to the probate judge, on oath,
that any person is suspected to have concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away or disposed of any moneys, goods or chattels of the decedent, or
has in his possession or knowledge, any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts
-or other writings, which contain evidences of, or tend to disclose the right, title, interest or claim of the decedent to any real or personal estate, or ‘any

claim or demand, or any last will, the judge may cite such person to appear
before the probate court, and may examine him on oath upon the matter of
such complaint. If such person is not in the county where letters have been
granted, he may be cited and examined, either before the probate court of
the county where he is found, or before the court issuing the citation. But
if in the latter case he appears and is found innocent, his necessary expensesmust be allowed him out of the estate.


SEC. 127. If the person so cited refuses to appear and submit to
an examination, or to answer such interrogatories as may be put to him,
touching the matter of the complaint, the court may, by warrant for that
purpose, commit him to the county jail, there to remain in close custody
until he submits to the order of the court, or is discharged according to law.
If, upon such examination, it appears that he has concealed, embezzled,
smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any moneys, goods, or chattels of
the decedent, or that he has in his possession or knowledge, any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or other writings, tending to disclose the right, title, interest, or claim of the decedent to any real or personal estate, claim,
or demand, or any lost will of the decedent, the probate court may make an.
order requiring such person to disclose his knowledge thereof to the executor
or administrator, and may commit him to the county jail, there to remain
until the order is complied with, or he is discharged according to law; and
all such interrogatories and answers must be in writing, signed by the party
examined, and tiled in the probate court. The order for such disclosure,
made upon such examination, is prima. facie evidence of the right of such
administrator to such property in any action brought for the recovery thereof; and any judgment recovered therein must be for double the value of the

property as assessed by the court or jury, or for return of the property, and .

damages in addition thereto, equal to the value of such property. In addition to the examination of the party, witnesses may be produced and examined on either side.


SEC. 128. The probate judge, upon the complaint, on oath, of any‘
executor or administrator, may cite any person who has been entrusted with
any part of the estate of the decedent, to appear before such court, and require him to render a full account, on oath, of any moneys, goods, chattels,
bonds, accounts or other property or papers belonging to the estate, which
have come to his possession in trust for the executor or administrator, and of
his proceedings thereon; and if the person so cited refuses to appear and

render such account, the court may proceed against him as provided in the
preceding section.

wearing apparel of the family, and of all the household furniture of the decedent, and are also entitled to a reasonable provision for their support, to
be allowed by the probate judge.


SEC. 130. Upon the return of the inventory, or at any subsequent
time during the administration, the court or the probate judge may, on his
own motion or on petition therefor, set apart for the use of the surviving husband or wife, or the minor children of the ‘decedent, all property exempt from
execution, including the homestead selected, designated and recorded. If none
has been selected, designated and recorded, the judge of the court must select, designate, set apart and cause to be recorded a homestead for the use of
the persons hereinbefore named, in the manner provided in article two of
this chapter, out of the real estate belonging to the decedent.


SEC. 131. If the amount set apart be insufiicient for the support of
the widow and children, or either, the probate court or judge must make such
reasonable allowance out of the estate as shall be necessary for the maintenance
of the family according to their circumstances, during the progress of the settlement of the estate; which, in case of an insolvent estate, must not be
longer than one year after granting letters testamentary or of administration.


SEC. 132. Any allowance made by the court or judge, in accordance with the provisions of this article, must be paid in preference to all other
charges, except funeral charges and expenses of administration; and any
such allowance whenever made, may, in the discretion of the court or judge
take effect from the death of the decedent.


SEC. 133. When property is set apart for the use of the family,
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, if the decedent left a widow
or surviving husband, and no minor child, such property is the property of
the widow or surviving husband. If the decedent left also a minor child or
children, the one-half of such property shall belong to the widow or surviving husband, and the remainder to the child, or in equal shares to the children, if there be more than one. If there be no widow or surviving husband
the whole belongs to the minor child or children.


SEC. 134. If, upon the return of the inventory of the estate of an
intestate, it appears that the value of the whole estate does not exceed the
sum of two thousand dollars, the probate court must appoint a day for the
hearing, and cause notice to be given and proceedings had, in the same manner as provided in sections 260, 262 and 265, of article two, of chapter ten,
of this act, relating to the settlement of accounts. If, upon the hearing, the
court finds that the value of the estate does not exceed the sum of two thousand dollars, the probate judge, by a decree for that purpose, must assign for
the use and support of the widow and minor child or children, if there be a
widow or minor child; and if no widow, then for the children, if there be
any, the whole of the estate, after the payment of the expenses of his last illness, funeral charges and expenses of administration. And there must be no
further proceedings in the administration unless further estate be discovered ;
and when it appears, on the return of the inventory, that the value of the
whole estate does not exceed the sum of three thousand dollars, it is in the
discretion of the probate court to dispense with the regular proceedings, or
any part thereof, prescribed in this title, except as herein provided, and there
must be had a summary administration of the estate, and an order of distribntion thereof at the end of six months after the issuing of letters. The
notice to creditors must be given to present their claims within four months
after the first publication of such notice, and those not so presented are barred
as in other cases.


SEC. 135. If the widow has a maintenance derived from her own
property equal to the portion set apart to her by the preceding sections of
this article, the whole property so set apart, other than her half of the homestead, must go to the minor children.

ARTICLE II.

OF THE HOMESTEAD.


SEC. 136. If the homestead selected by the husband and wife, or
either of them, during their coverture, and recorded while both were living,
was selected from the community property, it vests, on the death of the
husband or wife, absolutely in the survivor. If the homestead was selected
from the separate property of either husband or wife, it vests, on the death
of the person from whose property it was selected, in his or her heirs, subject to the power of the probate court to assign it for a limited period to the
family of the decedent. In either case it is not subject to the payment of
any debt or liability contracted by or existing against the husband and wife,
or either of them, previous to or at the time of the death of such husband or
wife, except as provided in this code.


SEC. 137. If the homestead selected and recorded prior to the
death of the decedent be returned in the inventory appraised at not exceeding
four thousand dollars in value, or was previously appraised as provided in
this code, and such appraised value did not exceed that sum, the probate
court must, by order, set it off to the persons in whom title is vested by the
preceding section. If there be subsistingliens or incumbrances on the homestead, the claims secured thereby must be presented and allowed as other
claims against the estate. If the funds of the estate be adequate to pay all
claims allowed against the estate, the claims so secured must be paid out of
such funds. If the funds of the estate be not sutiicieut for that purpose, the
claims so secured shall be paid proportionally with other claims allowed, and
the liens or incumbrances on the homestead shall only be enforced against
the homestead for any deficiency remaining after such payment.


SEC. 138. If the homestead, as selected and recorded, be returned in the inventory appraised at more than five thousand dollars, the
appraisers must, before they make their return, ascertain and appraise the
value of the homestead at the time the same was selected, and if such value
exceeded five thousand dollars, or if the homestead was appraised as provided
in this code, and such appraised value exceeded that sum, the appraisers
must determine whether the premises can be divided without material injury,
and if they find that they can be thus divided, they must admeasure and set
apart to the parties entitled thereto, such portion of the premises, including
the dwelling house, as will amount in value to the sum of four thousand
dollars, and make report thereof, giving the metes, bounds and full description of the portion set apart as a homestead. If the appraisers iind that the
premises exceeded in value, at the time of their selection, the sum of four
thousand dollars, and that they cannot be divided without material injury,
they must report such finding, and thereafter the court may make an order
for the sale of the premises and the distribution of the proceeds to the parties
entitled thereto.


SEC. 139. Any two of the appraisers concurring may discharge
the duties imposed upon the three, and make the report. A dissenting report
may be made by the third appraiser. The report must state fully the acts
of the appraisers. Both reports may be heard and considered,by the court
in determining a confirmation or rejection of the majority report, but the minority report must in no case be confirmed.


SEC. 140. When the report of the appraisers is filed, the court
must set a day for hearing any objections thereto, from any one interested
in the estate. Notice of the hearing must be given for such time, and in such
manner as the court may direct. If the court be satisfied that the report

is correct, it must be connrmed, otherwise rejected. In case the report is rejected, the court may appoint new appraisers to examine and report upon
the homestead, and similar proceedings may be had for the confirmation or
rejection of their report as upon the first report. ,


SEC. 141. The costs of all proceedings in the probate court, provided for in this chapter, must be paid by the estate, as expenses of administration. Persons succeeding by purchase or otherwise to theinterests, rights
and title of successors 'to homesteads, or to the right to have homesteads set
apart to them, as in this chapter provided, have all the rights and benefits
conferred by law on the persons whose interests and rights they acquire.


SEC. 142. A certitied copy of every final order made in pursuance of this article, by which a report is confirmed, property assigned or
sale confirmed, must be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county
where the homestead property is situated.

UHAPTER SIX.
CLAIMS AGAINST ESTATE.


SEC. 143. Every executor or administrator must, immediately
after his appointment, cause to be published in some newspaper of the
county, if there be one, if not, then in such newspaper as may be designated
by the court, a notice to the creditors of the decedent, requiring all persons
having claims against him to exhibit them, with necessary vouchers, to
the executor or administrator, at the place of his residence or business, to be
specified in the notice; such notice must be published as often as the judge
or court shall direct, but not less than once a week for four weeks; the court
or judge may also direct additional notice by publication or posting. In
case such executor or administrator resigns, or is removed before the time
expressed in the notice, his successor must give notice only for the unexpired time allowed for such presentation. .


SEC. 144. The time expressed in the notice must be ten months
after its iirst publication, when the estate exceeds in value the sum of three
thousand dollars, and four months when it does not. 
SEC. 145. After the notice is given, as required by the preceding section, a copy thereof, with the aflldavit of due publication, or of publication and posting, must be filed, and upon such affidavit or other testimony to
the satisfaction of the court, an order or decree showing that due notice to
creditors has been given, and directing that such order or decree be entered
in the minutes and recorded, must be made by the court.


SEC. 146. If a claim arising upon a contract heretofore made, be
not presented within the time limited in the notice, it is barred forever, except as follows: If it be not then due, or if it be contingent; it may be presented within one month after it becomes due or absolute; if it be made to
appear by the aiiidavit of the claimant, to the satisfaction of the executor or
administrator, and the probate judge, that the claimant had no notice, as
provided in this chapter, by reason of being out of the territory, it may be
presented any time before a decree of distribution is entered. A claim for a
deficiency remaining unpaid after a sale of property of the estate mortgaged
or pledged, must be presented within one month after such deficiency is ascertained. All claims arising upon contracts hereafter made, whether the
same be due, not due, or contingent, must be presented within the time
limited in the notice; and any claim not so presented, is barred forever;
provided, however, that when it is made to appear by the ailidavit of the
-claimant, to the satisfaction of the executor or administrator, and the probate judge, that the claimant had no notice as provided in this chapter, by
reason of being out of the territory, it may be presented at any time before
a decree of distribution is entered.


SEC. 147. Every claim which is due when presented to the administrator, must be supported by the aflldavit of the claimant, or some one in
his behalf, that the amount is justly due, that no payments have been made
‘thereon which are not credited, and that there are no offsets to the same, to
the knowledge of the claimant or atllant. If the claim be not due when presented, or be contingent, the particulars of such claim must be stated. When
the atiidavit is made by a person other than the claimant, he must set forth
in the affidavit the reasons why it is not made by the claimant. The oath may
be taken before any officer authorized to administer oaths. The executor or
administrator may also require satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be produced
in support of the claim. If the estate be insolvent, no greater rate of interest shall be allowed upon any claim, after the first publication of notice to
-creditors, than is allowed on judgments obtained in the district court.
When it shall appear, upon the settlement of the accounts of any executor or
administrator, that debts against the deceased have been paid without the
affidavit and allowance prescribed in this section, and it shall be proven by
competent evidence to the satisfaction of the probate court that such debts
were justly due, were paid in good faith, that the amount paid was the true
amount of such indebtedness over and above all payments or set-offs, and
that the estate is solvent, it shall be the duty of the said court to allow the
said sums so paid in the settlement of said accounts. '


SEC. 148. Any probate judge may present a claimagainst the
estate of a decedent, for allowance, to the executor or administrator thereof;
-and if the executor or administrator allows the claim, he must, in writing,
designate some probate judge of an adjoining county, who, upon the presentation of such claim to him, is vested with the same power to allow or reject
it as he would have if the will had been proved or administration granted in
his own county; and the probate judge presenting such claim, in case of its
rejection by the executor or administrator, or by such probate judge as shall
have acted upon it, has‘ the same right to sue in a proper court for its re-covery as other persons have when their claims against an estate are re_jected.


SEC. 149. When a claim, accompanied by the aflidavit required in

‘this chapter, is presented to the executor or administrator, he must indorse

thereon his allowance or rejection, with the day and date thereof. If he
allows the claim, it must be presented to the probate judge, for his approval,
who must, in the same manner, indorse upon it his allowance or rejection.
If the executor or administrator, or the judge, refuse or neglect to indorse
such allowance or rejection for ten days after the claim has been presented
to him, such refusal or neglect is equivalent to a rejection on the tenth day;
and if the presentation be made by a notary, the certificate of such notary,
under seal, is prima facie evidence of such presentation and rejection. If
the claim he presented to the executor or administrator before the expiration
of the time limited for the presentation of claims, the same is presented in
time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator, and by the judge
after the expiration of such time. If the claim be payable in a particular
kind of money or currency, it shall, if allowed, be payable only in such
money or currency. 1


SEC. 150. Every claim allowed by the executor or administrator,
and approved by the probate judge, or a copy thereof, as hereinafter pro'vided, must within thirty days thereafter be filed in the probate court, and

‘be ranked among the acknowledged debts of the estate, to be paid in due
course of administration. If the claim is founded on a bond, bill, note or
any other instrument, a copy of such instrument must accompany the claim,
and the original instrument must be exhibited if demanded, unless it is lost
or destroyed; in which case, the claimant must accompany his claim by his
aflidavit, containing a copy or particular description of such instrument, and
stating its loss or destruction; if the claim or any part thereof is secured by
a mortgage or other lien, which has been recorded in the office of the re' 'corder of the county in which the land affected by it lies, in which case it is

sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien, and refer to the date, volume
and page of its record. If in any case the claimant has left any original
voucher in the hands of the executor or administrator, or suffered the same
to be filed in court, he may withdraw the same when a copy thereof has been
already, or is then attached to his claim. A brief description of every claim
tiled must be entered by the clerk in the register, showing the name of the
-claimant, the amount and character of the claim, rate of interest and date of
allowance.


SEC. 151. When a claim is rejected, either by the executor or. administrator, or the probate judge, the holder must bring suit in the proper
-court against theexecutor or administrator, within three months after date of
its rejection, if it be then due, or within two months after it becomes due,
otherwise the claim is forever barred.


SEC. 152. No claim must be allowed by the executor or administrator, or by the probate judge, which is barred by the statute of limitations. When a claim is presented to the probate judge for his allowance, he
‘may, in his discretion, examine the claimant and others, on oath, and hear
any other legal evidence touching the validity of,the claim.

1117. (Ste. 153. No holder of any claim against an estateshall maintain
any action thereon, unless the claim is first presented to the executor or administrator, except in the following case: an action may be brought by any
holder of a mortgage or lien to enforce the same against the property of the
estate subject thereto, where all recourse against any other property of the
«estate is expressly waived in the complaint; but no counsel fees shall be recovered in such action unless such claim be so presented.


SEC. 154. The time during which there shall be a vacancy in
the administration must not be included in any limitations herein prescribed.


SEC. 155. If an action is pending against the decedent at the
time of his death, the plaintiff must in like manner present his claim to the
executor or administrator for allowance or rejection, authenticated as required in other cases; and as recovery shall be had in the action unless proof
be made of the presentations required.


SEC. 156. Whenever any claim is presented to an executor or administrator, or to the probate judge, and he is willing to allow the same in
part, he must state in his indorsement the amount he is willing to allow. If
the creditor refuse to accept the amount allowed in satisfaction of his claim.
he shall recover no costs in any action therefor, brought against the executor
or administrator, unless he recovers a greater amount than that offered to be
allowed.


SEC. 157. A judgment rendered against an executor or administrator, upon any claim for money against the estate of his testator or intestate, only establishes the claim in the samemanner as if it had been allowed by
the executor or administrator and the probate judge, and the judgment must
be, that the executor or administrator pay in due course of adn£nistration
the amount ascertained to be due. A certified transcript of the judgment
-must be filed in- the probate oourt. N o execution must issue upon such judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property of the estate or give to
the judgment creditor any priority of payment.


SEC. 158. When any judgment has been rendered for or against
the testator intestate in his lifetime, no execution shall issue thereon after his
death, except as provided in this code. A judgment against the decedent
for the recovery of money must be presented to the executor or administrator
like any other claim. If execution is actually levied upon any property of
the decedent before his death, the same may be sold for the satisfaction»
thereof; and the officer making the sale must account to the executor or ad-'
-ministrator for any surplus in his hands. A judgment creditor having a
judgment which was rendered against the testator or intestate in his lifetime,
may redeem any real estate of the decedent from any sale under foreclosure
or execution in like manner, and with like effect, as if the judgment debtor
were still living. _


SEC. 159. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying after
verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment is rendered
thereon, is not a lien on the real property of the decedent, but is payable in
due.course of administration. 2

SEC. 160. If the executor or administrator doubts the correctness.
of any claim presented to him he may enter into an agreement, in writing,
with the claimant, to refer the matter in controversy to some disinterested
person, to be approved by the probate judge. Upon filing the agreement
and approval of the probate judge in the oflice of the clerk of the district
court for the county in which the letters testamentary or of administration
were granted, the clerk must, either in vacation or in term, enter a minute of
the order referring the matter in controversy to the person so selected; or,
of the parties consent, a reference may be had in the probate court; and the
report of the_ referee, if confirmed, establishes or rejects the claim the
same as if it had been allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator
and the probate judge. _


SEC. 161. The referee must bear and determine the matter, and
make his report thereon to the court in which his appointmentis entered.
The same proceedings shall be had in all respects, and the referee shall
have the same powers, be entitledto the same compensation and subject to
the same control, as in other cases of reference. The court may remove the
referee, appoint another in his place, set aside or confirm his report, and adjudge costs, as in actions against executors or administrators, and the judgment of the court thereon shall be as valid and effectual, in all respects, as
if the same had been rendered in a suit commenced by ordinary process.


SEC. 162. When a judgment is recovered, with costs, against any
executor or administrator, he shall be individually liable for such costs but
they must be allowed him in his administration accounts, unless it appears
that the suit or proceeding in which the costs were taxed, was prosecuted or
defended without just cause.


SEC. 163. If the executor or administrator is a creditor of the decedent, his claim, duly authenticated by affidavits, must be presented for allowance or rejection to the probate judge, and its allowance by the judge is
suflicient evidence of its correctness, and it must be paid as other claims, in
due course of administration. If, however, the probate judge rejects the’
claim, action thereon may be had against the estate by the claimant, and
summons must be served upon the probate judge, who may appointan attorney at the expense of the estate to defend the action. If the claimant recovers no judgment, he must pay all costs, including defendant’s attorney's
fees. ”


SEC. 164. If an executor or administrator neglects for two
months after his appointment to give notice to creditors, as prescribed by

this chapter the court must revoke his letters, and appoint some other person
in his stead, equally or the next in order entitled to the appointment.


SEC. 165. At the same term at which he is required to return
his inventory, the executor or administrator must also return a statement of
all claims against the estate which have been presented to him, if so required
by the court; and from term to term thereafter he must present a statement.
of claims subsequently presented to him. In all such statements he must
designate the names of the creditors, the nature of each claim, when it became due or will become due, and whether it was allowed or rejected by“
him. ‘


SEC. 166. If there be any debt of the decedent bearing interest,
whether presented or not, the executor or administrator may, by order of the
court, pay the amount then accumulated and unpaid. or any part thereof, at
any time_when there are sufficient funds properly applicable thereto, whether
said claim he then due or not; and interest shall thereupon cease to accrue
upon the amount so paid. This section does not apply to‘ existing debts,
unless the creditor consent to accept the amount.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

ARTICLE I.

SALES IN GENERAL.


SEC. 167. All the property of a decedent shall be chargeable
with the payment of the debts of the deceased, the expenses of administration, and the allowance to the family, except as otherwise provided in this

may direct, in the manner prescribed in this chapter. There shall be no
priority as between personal and real property for the above purposes. 1


SEC. 168. No sale of any property of an estate of a decedent is
valid, unless made underorder of the probate court, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter. All sales must be reported under oath, and confirmed by the probate court before the title to the property sold passes.


SEC. 169. All petitions for orders of sale must be in writing, set1 ting forth the facts showing the sale to be necessary, and, upon the hearing,

any person interested in the estate may file his written objections, which must
be heard and determined. A failure to set forth the facts showing the sale
to be necessary will not invalidate the subsequent proceedings, if the defect
be supplied by the proofs at the hearing, and the general facts showing the
necessity be stated in the order directing the sale.


SEC. 170. When it appears to the court that the estate is insolvent, or that it will require a sale of all the property of the estate, of every
character, to pay the family allowance, expenses of administration and debts,
there need be but one petition filed, but one order of sale made, and but one
sale had, except in the case of perishable property, which may be sold as
provided in section 171. The probate court, when a petition for the sale of
any property, for any of the purposes herein named, is presented, must inquire fully -into the probable amount required to make all such payments, and
if there be no more estate than sufficient to pay the same, may require but
one proceeding for the sale of the entire estate. In such case the petition
must set forth substantially the facts required by section 182.

ARTICLE II.

SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.


SEC. 171. At any time after receivingletters, the executor, administrator or special administrator may apply to the court or judge and obtain an order to sell perishable and all other personal property likely to
depreciate in value, or which will incur loss or expense by being kept, and
so much other personal property as may be necessary to pay the allowance
made to the family of the decedent. The order for the sale may be made
without notice; but the executor, administrator or special administrator is
responsible for the property, unless, after making a sworn return on a proper
showing, the court shall approve the sale. _


SEC. 172. If claims against the estate have been allowed, and a
sale of property is-necessary for their payment, or the expenses of administration, or for the payment of legacies, the executor or administrator may
apply for an order to sell so much of the personal property as may be necessary therefor. Upon tiling his petition, notice of at least five days must be
given of the hearing of the application, either by posting notices or by advertising. He may also make a similar application, either in vacation or term,
from time to time, so long as any personal property remains in his hands,
and sale thereof is necessary. If it appear for the best interest of the estate,
he may, at any time after filing the inventory, in like manner, and after
giving like notice, apply for and obtain an order to sell the whole of the
personal property belonging to the estate, whether necessary to pay debts or
not.


SEC. 173. Partnership interests or interests belonging to any
estate by virtue of any partnership formerly existing, interests in personal
property pledged, and choses ti action, may be sold in the same manner as
other personal property, when it appears to be for the best interest of the
estate. Before confirming the sale of any partnership interest, whether made‘
to the surviving partner or to any other person, the court or judge must carefully inquire into the condition of the partnership aHairs, and must examine
the surviving partner, if in the county and able to be present in court.


SEC. 174. If it appears that a sale is necessary for the payment
of debts or the family allowance, or for the best interest of the estate and the
persons interested in the property to be sold, whether it is or is not necessary
to pay the debts or family allowance, the court or judge must order it to be
made. In making orders and sales for the payment of debts or family allowance, such articles as are not necessary for the support and subsistence of
the family of the decedent, or are not specially bequeathed, must be first
sold, and the court or judge must so direct.


SEC. 175. The sale of personal property must be made at puliic
auction, for such money or currency as the court may direct, and after
public notice given for at least ten days, by notices posted in three public
places in the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both, containing
the time and place of sale, and a brief description of the property to be sold;
unless, for good reason shown, the probate court or judge orders a private
sale, or a shorter notice. Public sales of such property must be made at the
court house door, or at the residence of the decedent, or at some other public place, but no sale shall be made of any personal property, which is not
present at the time of sale, unless the court otherwise order. x

grounds upon which the sale is asked to be made.


SEC. 178. Upon the presentation of such petition, the probate
judge must make an order directing all persons interested to appear before
him at a time and place specified, not less than four nor more than ten weeks
from the time of making such order, to show cause why an order should not
be granted to the executor or administrator to sell such mines, mining interests, shares or stocks, as are set forth in the petition and belonging to the estate. A copy of the order to show cause must be personally served on all
persons interested in the estate, at least ten days before the time appointed

newspaper as the court shall specify. If all persons interested in the estate
signify in writing their assent to such sale, the notice may be dispensed
with.

SEC. 179. If, upon hearing the petition, it appears to the satisfaction of the probate judge that it is to the interest of the estate that such
mining property or interests of the estate should be sold, or if it appears to
his satisfaction that an immediate sale is necessary in order to secure the just
rights or interests of the mining partners or tenants in common, in which such
shares, stocks. or property are held, such probate judge must make an order
authorizing the executor or administrator to sell such mining interests,
mines or shares, as hereinafter provided.


SEC. 180. After the order of sale is made, all further proceedings for the sale of such mining property, and for the notice, report and
confirmation thereof, must be in conformity with the provisions of article four
of this chapter. ~

ARTICLE IV.

SALE OF BEAT. ESTATE, INTERESTS THEREIN, AND CONFIRMATION THEREOF.


SEC. 181. When a sale of property of the estate is necessary to
pay the allowance of the family, or the debts outstanding against the decedent, or the debts, expenses, or charges of administration, or legacies, the
-executor or administrator may also sell any real, as well as personal property
of the estate, for that purpose, upon the order of the probate court; and an
application for the sale of real property may also embrace the sale of personal property.


SEC. 182. To obtain an order for the sale of real property, he
must present a verified petition to the probate court, or to the judge at
chambers, setting forth the amount of personal property that has come to
his hands, and how much thereof, if any, remains undisposed of; the debts

outstanding against the decedent, as far as can be ascertained or estimated :
the amount due upon the family allowance, or that will be due after the same
has been in force for one year; the debts, expenses, and charges of administration already accrued, and an estimate of what will or may accrue during
the administration; a general description of all the real property of which

I the decedent died seized, or in which he had any interest, or in which the estate
has acquired any interest, and the condition and value thereof, and whether the
same be community or separate property ; the names of the legatee and devisees,
if any, and of the heirs of the decedent, so far as known to the petitioner.
If any of the matters here enumerated cannot be ascertained, it must be so
stated in the petition; but a failure to set forth the facts showing the sale to
be necessary, will not invalidate the subsequent proceedings, if the defect be
supplied by the proofs at the hearing, and the general facts showing such
necessity be stated in the decree.


SEC. 183. If it appears to the court orjudge, from such petition,
that it is necessary to sell the whole or some portion of the real estate for
the purposes and reasons mentioned in the preceding section, or any of them,
such petition must be filed and an order thereupon made, directing all persons interested in the estate to appear before the court, at a time and place
specified, not less than four nor more than ten weeks from the time of making such order, to show cause why an order should not be granted to the
executor or administrator to sell so much of the real estate of the decedent
as is necessary.


SEC. 184. A copy of the order to show cause must be personally
served on all persons interested in the estate, any general guardian of a
minor so interested, and any legatee, or devisee, or heir of the decedent,
provided they are residents of the county at least ten days before the time
appointed for hearing the petition, or be published four successive weeks in
such newspaper in the county as the court or judge shall direct. If all
persons interested in the estate join in the petition for the sale, or signify in
writing their assent thereto, the notice may be dispensed with, and the hearing may be had at any time.


SEC. 185. The probate court, at the time and place appointed in
such order, or at such other time to which the hearing may be postponed,
upon satisfactory proof of personal service or publication of a copy of the
order. by atiidavit or otherwise, if the consent-, in writing, to such sale of
all parties interested is not filed, must proceed to hear the petition, and hear
and examine the allegations and proofs of the petitioners, and of all persons
interested in the estate who may oppose the application. All claims against
the decedent not before presented, if the period of presentation has not
elapsed, may be presented and passed upon at the hearing.


SEC. 186. The executor, administrator and Witnesses may be examined on oath by either party. and process to compel them to attend and
testify may be issued by the probate judge, in the same manner and with like
effect as in other cases.


SEC. 187. If it appears necessary to sell a part of the real estate,
and that by a sale thereof the residue of the estate, real or personal, or some
specific part thereof, would be greatly injured or diminished in value, or subjectcd to expense, or rendered unprofitable, or that after any such sale the
residue would be so small in quantity or value, or would be of such a character with reference to its future disposition among the heirs or devise-es, as
clearly to render it for the best interest of all concerned that the same should
be sold, the court may authorize the sale of the whole estate or of any part
thereof necessary and for the best interest of all concerned.

SEC. 188. If the court is satisfied, after a full bearing upon the
petition, and an examination of the proofs and allegations of the parties

interested, that a sale of the whole or some portion of the real estate is necessary, for any of the causes mentioned in this article, or if such sale be assented
to by all the persons interested, an order must be made to sell the whole, or
so much and such parts of the real estate described in the petition, as the
court shall judge necessary or beneficial.


SEC. 189. The order of sale must describe the lands to he sold
and the terms of sale, which may be for cash, or on credit not exceeding
one year. payable in gross or installments, and in such kind of money, with
interest, as the court may direct. The land may be sold in one parcel or invsubdivisions, as the executor or administrator shall judge most beneficial to
the estate, unless the court otherwise specially directs. If it appears that
any part of such real estate has been devised and not charged in such devise
with the payment of debts or legacies, the court must order the remainder to
be sold before that so devised. Every such sale must be ordered to be made
at public auction, unless, in the opinion of the court, it would benefit the
estate to sell the whole or some part of such real estate at private sale; the
court may, if the same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such real
estate or any part thereof, to be sold at either public or private sale, as the
executoror administrator shall judge to be most beneficial for the estate.
If the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale under the
order and as directed therein, he may be compelled to sell, by order of the
court, made on motion, after due notice, by any party interested.


SEC. 190. If the executor or administrator neglects to apply for
an order of sale when it is necessary, any person may make application
therefor, in the same manner as the executor or administrator, and notice
thereof must be given to the execut )1’ or administrator, before the hearing.
The petition of such applicant must contain as many of the matters set forth.
in section one hundred and eighty-two as he can ascertain. and the decree of’
sale must fix the period of time within which the executor or administrator
must make the sale.


SEC. 191. “Then a sale is ordered, and is to be made at public
auction, notice of the time and place of sale must be posted up in three of
the most public places in the county in which the land is situated, and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed in the same county, but if none,
then in such paper as the court may direct, for three weeks successively next
before the sale; the lands and tenements to be sold must be described with
common certainty in the notice.

SEC. 192. Sales at public auction must be made in the county
where the land is situated, but when the land is situated in two or more counties, it may be sold in either. The sale must be made between the hours of
nine o'clock in the morning and the setting of the sun on the same day, and
must be made on the day named in the notice of sale, unless the same is postoned.
P 
SEC. 193. When the saleof real estate is ordered tobe made at private sale, notice of the same must be posted up in three of the most public
placesin the county in which the land is situated and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed in the same county——if none, then in such
paper as the court may direct— for two weeks successively next before theday on or after which the sale is to be made, in which the lands and tenements to be sold must be described with common certainty. The notice must
state a day on or after which the sale will be made, and a place where offers
or bids will be received. The day last referred to must be at least fifteen
days from the first publication of notice. and the sale must not be made before that day, but must be made within six months thereafter. The bids or
offers must be in writing. and may be left at the place designated in the no.
tice, or delivered to the executor or administrator personally, or may be filed

in the office of the clerk of the probate court, to which the return of sale must
be made, at any time after the first publication of the notice and before the
making of the sale. If it is shown that it will be for the best interest of the
estate, the court or judge may, by an order, shorten the time of notice, which
shall not, however, be less than one week, and may provide that the sale may
be made on or after a day less than fifteen but not less than eight days from
the first publication of the notice, in which case the notice of sale and the
sale may be made to correspond with such order.


SEC. 194. No sale of real estate at private sale shall be confirmed
by the court, unless the sum offered is at least ninety per cent of the appraised value thereof, nor unless such real estate has been appraised within
one year of the time of such sale. If it has not been so appraised. or if the
court is satisfied that the appraisement is too high or too low, appraisers must
be appointed, and they must make an appraisement thereof in the same manner as in case of an original appraisement of an estate. This may be done at
any time before the sale or the confirmation.


SEC. 195. The executor or administrator must, when the sale is
made upon a credit, take the notes of the purchaser for the purchase money,
with a mortgage on the property to secure their payment.


SEC. 196. The executor or administrator, after making any sale
of real estate, must make a return of his proceedings to the probate court,
which must be filed in the oflice of the clerk, at any time subsequent to the
sale, either in term or vacation. If the sale is made at public auction, and
the returns made and filed on or before the first day of the next term thereafter, no notice is required of such return or of the hearing thereof, but the
hearing may be had upon the first day of the term, or any subsequent day
to which the same may be postponed. If the sale be not made at public
auction, or if made at public auction a hearing upon the return of proceedings be asked for in the return, or is brought on for a bearing upon a day
before the first day of the next term thereafter, or upon any other day than
the first day of the next term after such sale, the court or judge must fix the day
for the hearing, of which notice of at least ten days must be given by the clerk,
by notices posted in three public places in the county, or by publication in a
newspaper, or both, as the court or judge shall direct, and must briefly indicate the land sold, the sum for which it was sold, and must refer to the return for further particulars. Upon the hearing, the court must examine the
return and witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings were unfair, or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and that a sum exceeding
such bid at least ten per cent exclusive of the expenses of a new sale, may be
obtained, the court may vacate the sale and direct another to be had, of which
notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted as if no previous
sale had taken place; if an offer ten per cent more in amount than that
named in the return, he made to the court in writing, by a responsible person, it is the discretion of the court to accept such offer and confirm the sale
to such person, or to ordera new sale.


SEC. 197. When return of the sale is made and filed, any person
interested in the estate may file written objections to the confirmation thereof,
and may be heard thereon, when the return is heard by the court or judge,
and may produce witnesses in support of his objections.


SEC. 198. If it appears to the court that the sale was legally
made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was not disproportionate
to the value of the property sold, and that a greater sum. as above specitled,
cannot be obtained,or if the increased bid mentioned in section one hundred and ninety-six be made and accepted by the court, the court must make
an order confirming the sale, and directing conveyances to be executed. The
sale, from that time, is confirmed and valid, and a certified copy of the order

confirming it and directing conveyances to be executed, must be recorded in ’

the oflice of the recorder of the county within which the land sold is situated. If, after the confirmation, the purchaser neglects or refuses to comply
with the terms of sale, the court may, on motion of the executor or administrator, and after notice to the purchaser, order a re-sale to be made of the
property. If the amount realized on such re-sale does not cover the bid and
expenses of the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the deficiency of
the estate.


SEC. 199. Conveyances must thereupon be executed to the purchaser by the executor or administrator, and they must refer to the orders of
the probate court authorizing and confirming the sale of the property of the
estate, and directing conveyances thereof to be executed, and to the record
of the order of confirmation in the office of the county recorder, either by
the date of such recording or by the date, volume and page of the record,
and such reference shall have the same effect as if the order were at large
inserted in the conveyance. Conveyances so made convey all the right, title,
interest and estate of the decedent in the premises, at the time of his death;
if prior to the sale, by operation of law or otherwise, the estate has acquired
any right, title or interest in the premises, other than in addition to that of
the decedent at the time of his death, such right, title or interest also. passes
by such conveyances.


SEC. 200. Before any order is entered confirming the sale, it
must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that notice was given of the
sale as prescribed, and the order of confirmation must show that such proof
was made.


SEC. 201. If, at the time appointed for the sale, the executor or
administrator deems it for the interest of all persons concerned therein that
the same be postponed, he may postpone it from time to time. not exceeding
in all three months.


SEC. 202. In case of a postponement, notice thereof must be
given, by a public declaration, at the time and place first appointed for the
sale, and if the postponement be for more than one day, further notice must
be given by posting notices in three or more public places in the county where
the land is situated, or publishing the same, or both, as the time and circumstances will admit.


SEC. 203. If the testator makes provision by his will or designates the estate to be appropriated for the payment of his debts, the
expenses of administration or family expenses, they must be paid according
to such provision or designation, out of the estate thus appropriated, so far
as the same is sufficient. '


SEC. 204. When property is directed by the will to be sold, or
authority is given in the will to sell property, the executor may sell any
property of the estate without the order of the probate court, and at
either public or private sale, and with or without notice, as the executor
may determine; but the executor must make return of such sales as in
other cases; and if directions are given in the will as to the mode of
selling, or the particular property to be sold, such directions must be observed. In either case no title passes unless the sale is confirmed by the
court.


SEC. 205. If the provision made by the will, or the estate appropriated therefor, is insufficient to pay the debts, expenses of administration
and family expenses, that portion of the estate not devised or disposed of by
the will, if any, must be appropriated and disposed of for that purpose, according to the provisions of this chapter.


SEC. 206. The estate, real and personal, given by will to legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of administration and family

expenses, in proportion to the value or amount of the several devises or legacies, but specilic devises or legacies are exempt from such liability if it
appears to the court necessary to carry into effect the intention of the testator and there is no other sufficient estate.


SEC. 207. When an estate given by will has been sold for the payment of debts or expenses, all the devisees and legatees must contribute
according to their respective interests to the devisee or legatee whose devise
or legacy has been taken therefor, and the probate court, when distribution
is made, must, by decree for that purpose, settle the amount of the several
liabilities and decree the amount each person shall contribute, and reserve
the same from their distributive shares respectively, for the purpose of paying
such contribution.


SEC. 208. If a decedent, at the time of his death, was possessed
of acontract for the purchase of lands, his interest in such land and under
such contracts may be sold on the application of his executor or administrator, in the same manner as if he had died seized of such land, and the
same proceedings may be had for that purpose as are prescribed in this chapter forthe sale of lands of which he died seized, except as hereinafter
provided.


SEC. 209. The sale must be made subject to all payments that
may thereafter become due on such contracts. any If there are any such, the
sale must not be confirmed by the probate judge until the purchasers execute
a bond to the executor or administrator, for the benefit and indemnity of himself and of the persons entitled to the interest of the decedent in the lands so
contracted for, in double the whole amount of payments thereafter to become
due on such contract, with such sureties as the probate judge shall approve.

SEC. 210. The bond must be conditioned that the purchaser will
make all p.a_\'ments for such land that become due after the date of the sale,
and will fully indemnify the executor or administrator and the persons so
entitled, against all demands. costs, charges and expenses, by reason of any
covenant or agreement contained in such contract.


SEC. 211. Upon the confirmation of the sale, the executor or administrator must execute to the purchaser an assignment of the contract,
which vests in the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, all the right, title and
interest of the estate, or of the persons entitled to the interest of the decedent, in the lands sold at the time of the sale, and the purchaser has the same
rights and remedies against the vendor of such land as the decedent would
have bad if he were living.

SEC. 212. When any sale is made by an executor or administrator, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, of lands subject to any
mortgage or other lien, which is a valid claim against the estate of the decedent, and has been presented and allowed, the purchase money must be
applied, after paying the necessary expenses of the sale, first to the payment
and satisfaction of the mortgage or lien, and the residue, if any, in due
course of administration. The application of the purchase money to the
satisfaction of the mortgage or lien must be made without delay,and the
land is subject to such mortgage or lien, until the purchase money has been
actually so applied. N 0 claim against any estate which has been presented
and allowed, is affected by the statute of limitations pending the proceedings
for the settlement of the estate. The purchase money, or so much thereof
as may be suiilcient to pay such mortgage or lien, with interest, and any lawful costs and charges thereon, may be paid into the probate court, to be received by the clerk thereof, whereupon the mortgage or lien upon the land
must cease, and the purchase money must be paid over by the clerk of the
court without delay, in payment of the expenses of the sale, and in satisfaction of the debt to secure which the mortgage or other lien was taken, and

/

the surplus, if any, at once returned to the executor or administrator, unless
for good cause shown, after notice to the executor or administrator, the court
otherwise directs.


SEC. 213. At any sale, under order of the probate court, of lands
upon which there is a mortgage or lien, the holder thereof may become the
purchaser, and his receipt for the amount due him from the proceeds of the
sale is a payment pro tanto. If the amount for which he purchased the property is insufficient to defray the expenses and discharge his mortgage or lien,
he must pay to the court or the clerk thereof an amount suflieient to pay such
expenses.


SEC. 214. If there is any neglect or misconduct in the proceedings
of the executor in relation to any sale, by which any person interested in the
estate suffers damage, the party aggrieved may recover the same in an action
upon the bond of the executor or administrator, or otherwise.


SEC. 215. Any executor or administrator who fraudulently sells
any real estate of a decedent contrary to or otherwise than under the provisions of this chapter, is liable in double the value of the land sold, as liquidated damages, to he recovered in an action by the person having an estate
-of inheritance therein. .


SEC. 216. No action for the recovery of any estate, sold by an
executor or administrator under the provisions of this chapter, can be maintained hy any heir or other person claiming under the decedent, unless it be
commenced within three years next after the sale. An action to set aside the
sale may be instituted and maintained at any time within three years from
the discovery of the fraud or other grounds upon which the action is based.


SEC. 217. The preceding section shall not apply to minors or
others under any legal disability to sue at the time when the right of action
first accrues ; but all such persons may commence an action at any time within
three years after the removal of the disability.


SEC. 218. When a sale has been made by an executor or administrator, of any property of the estate, real or personal, he must return to
the probate court. at its next term thereafter, an account of sales, verified by

’ his atiidavit. If he neglects to make such return, he may be punished by

attachment, or his letters may be revoked, one day's notice having been first
given him to appear and show cause why such attachment should not issue or
such revocation should not be made.


SEC. 219. No executor or administrator must, directly or indirectly, purchase any property of the estate he represents, nor must he be
interested in any such sale.

SEC. 220. The executor or administrator must take into his possession all the estate of the decedent, real and personal, and collect all debts
due to the decedent, or to the estate. For the purpose of bringing suits to
quiet titles or for partition of such estate, the possession of the executors or
administrators is the possession of the heirs or devisees; such possession by
the heirs or devisees is subject, however, to the possession of the executor
or administrator, for the purpose of administration, as provided in this title.


SEC. 221. Actions for the recovery of any property, real or personal, or for the possession thereof, and all actions founded upon contracts,

testators or intestates.


SEC. 222. Executors and administrators may maintain actions
against any person who has wasted, destroyed, taken or carried away, or‘
converted to his own use, the goods of their testator or intestate, in his lifetime. They may also maintain actions for tresspass committed on the real

SEC. 223. Any person or his personal representatives may maintain an action against the executor or administrator of- any testator or intestate who in his lifetime has wasted, destroyed, taken or carried away, or

SEC. 224. When a partnership exists between the decedent, at
the time of his death, and any other person, the surviving partner has the
right to continue in possession of the partnership, and to settle its business,
but the interest of the decedent in the partnership must be included in the
inventory, and be appraised and appropriated as other property. The surviving partner must settle the affairs of the partnership without delay, and
account with the executor or administrator, and pay over such balances asmay from time to time be payable to him, in right of the decedent. Upon
the application of the executor or administrator, the probate judge may,
whenever it appears necessary, order the surviving partner to render an account, and in case of neglect or refusal may, after notice, compel it by
attachment; and the executor or administrator may maintain against him any
action which the decedent could have maintained.


SEC. 225. Any administrator may, in his own name, for the useand benefit of all parties interested in the estate, maintain actions on thebond of an executor, or of any former administrator of the same estate.

SEC. 228. When there is a deficiency of assets in the hands of an
executor or administrator, and when the decedent, in his lifetime, has conveyed any real estate or any rights or interests therein, with intent to defraud
his creditors, or to avoid any right, debt or duty of any person, or has so
conveyed such estate that by law the deeds or conveyances are void as against
creditors, the executor or administrator must commence and prosecute to final
judgment any proper action for the recovery of the same; and may recover
for the benefit of the creditors all such real estate so fraudulently conveyed,
and may also, for the benefit of the creditors, sue and recover all goods,
chattels, rights or credits which have been so conveyed by the decedent in his
lifetime, whatever may have been the manner of such fraudulent conveyance.


SEC. 229. No executor or administrator is bound to sue for such
estate so mentioned in the preceding section, for the benefit of the creditors,
unless on application of creditors, who must pay such part of the costs and
expenses of the suit, or give such security to the executor or administrator
therefor, as the probate judge shall direct.

SEC. 230. All real estate so recovered must be sold for the payment of debts, in the same manner as the decedent had died seized thereof
upon obtaining an order therefor from the probate court; and the proceeds
of all goods, chattels, rights and credits so recovered must be appropriated

SEC. 231. When a person who is bound by contract, in writing,
to convey any real estate dies before making the conveyance, and in all cases
where such decedent, if living, might be compelled to make such conveyance,
the probate court may make a decree authorizing and directing his executor
or administrator to convey such real estate to the person entitled thereto.


SEC. 232. On the presentation of a verified petition by any person
claiming to be entitled to such conveyance from an executor or administrator,
setting forth the facts upon which the claim is predicated, the probate court
must appoint a time and place for hearing the petition, at a regular term of
the court; and must order notice thereof to be published at least four successive weeks before such hearing, in such newspaper in this territory as he may
designate.


SEC. 233. At the time and place appointed for the hearing, or at
such other time to which the same may be postponed, upon satisfactory proof
by affidavit or otherwise of the due publication of the notice, the court must
proceed to a hearing, and all persons interested in the estate may appear and
contest such petition by filing their objections in writing, and the court may
examine, on oath, the petitioner and all who may be produced before him for
that purpose.


SEC. 234. If, after a full hearing upon the petition and objections,
and examination of the facts and circumstances of the claim, the court is satisiied that the petitioner is entitled to a conveyance of the real estate described
in the petition, a decree authorizing and directing the executor or administrator to execute a conveyance thereof to the petitioner must be made, entered on the minutes of the court and recorded.


SEC. 235. The executor or administrator must execute the conveyance according to the directions of the decree, a certified copy of which
must be recorded with the deed in the office of the recorder of the county
where the lands lie, and is prima facie evidence of the correctness of the proceedings, and of the authority of the executor or administrator to make the
conveyance.


SEC. 236. If, upon the hearing in the probate court, as hereinbefore provided,jthe right of the petitioner to have a specific performance of the
contract is found to be doubtful, the court must dismiss the petition without
prejudice to the rights of the petitioner, who may, at any time within six
months thereafter, proceed, in the district court, to enforce a specific performance thereof.


SEC. 237. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a decree of
the probate court, as provided in this chapter, shall pass the title to the estate contracted for as fully as if the contracting party himself was still living

and executed the conveyance.

SEC. 238. A copy of the decree for a conveyance, made by the

probate court, and duly certified and recorded in the oflice of the recorder of
the county where the lands lie, gives the person entitled to the conveyance a
right to the possession of the lands contracted for, and to hold the same according to the terms of the intended conveyance, in like manner as if they
had been conveyed in pursuance of the decree.


SEC. 239. The recording of any decree, as provided in the preceding section, shall not prevent the court making the decree from enforcing‘

the same by other process.

SEC. 240. If the person entitled to the conveyance dies before the

commencement of proceedings therefor under this chapter, or before the completion of the conveyance, any person entitled to ‘succeed to his rights in the
contract, or the executor or administrator of such decedent may, for the benefit of the person so entitled, commence such proceedings or prosecute any
already commenced, and the conveyance must be so made as to vest the estate in the persons entitled to it, or in the executor or administrator, for their
benefit.


SEC. 241. The decree provided for in this chapter may direct the
possession of the property therein described to be surrendered to the person
entitled thereto, upon his producing the deed and a certified copy of the decree, when, by the terms of the contract, possession is to be surrendered.

ARTICLE I.

LIABILITIES AND COMPENSATION OF EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS.


SEC. 242. No executor or administrator is chargeable upon any

special promise to answer damages or to pay the debts of the testator or intestate out of his own estate, unless the agreement for that purpose, or some

administrator, or by some other person by him thereunto specially authorized.

- 
SEC. 243. Every executor and administrator is chargeable in his.
account with the whole of the estate of the decedent which may come into

SEC. 245. No executor or administrator is accountable for any
debts due to the decedent, if it appears that they remain uncollected without
his fault.


SEC. 246. He shall be allowed all necessary expenses in the care,

the executor or administrator to appear and show cause why an attachment
should not issue. Every account must exhibit all debts which have been presented and allowed during the period embraced in the account.

SEC. 256. When the authority of an executor or administrator
ceases or is revoked for any reason, he may be cited to account before the

for a final settlement, and a petition for the final distribution of the estate be
filed with said account, the notice of the settlement must state those facts,
which notice must be given by posting a publication as the court may direct
and for such time as may be ordered. On the settlement of said account,
distribution and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto may be immediately had, without further notice or proceedings.

contest the same.


SEC. 263. All matters, including allowed claims. not passed
upon on the settlement of any former account, or on rendering an exhibit,
-or on making a decree of sale, may be contested by the heirs, for cause
shown. The hearing and allegations of the respective parties may be post_poned from time to time, when necessary, and the court may appoint one or

more referees to examine the accounts and make report thereon, subject to
confirmation; and may allow a reasonable compensation to the referees, to
be paid out of the estate of the decedent.


SEC. 264. The settlement of the account and 'the allowance
thereof by the court or upon appeal, is conclusive against all persons in any
way interested in the estate, saving, however,,to all persons laboring under
any legal disability, their right to move for cause, to reopen and examine the
account, or to proceed by action against the executor, or administrator,
either individually or upon his bond, at any time before final distribution;
and in any action brought by any such person, the allowance and settlement

first proved that notice has been given as required by this chapter, and the
decree must show that such proof was made to the satisfaction of the court,
and is conclusive evidence of the fact.

an application for the sale of real property, that it would be for the interest
of the estate that personal property of the estate, or some part of such property should be first sold, the court may decree the sale of such personal

‘ any party interested therein, the probate court may order any moneys in the

in the order of their date.

6. All other demands against the estate.


SEC. 269. The preference given in the preceding section to a
mortgage only extends to the proceeds of the property mortgaged. Ifthe proceeds of such property are insufficient to pay the mortgage, the part
remaining unsatisfied must be classed with other demands against the estate.


SEC. 270. If the estate is insuflieient to pay all the debts of any
one class, each creditor must be paid a dividend in proportion to his claim;

and no creditor of any one class shall receive such payment until all those of ’

or administrator as required in this chapter, the court must make an order
for the payment of the debts, as circumstances of the estate require. If
there is not sufficient funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, the
court must specify in the decree the sum to be paid to each creditor. If the
whole property of the estate be exhausted by such payment or distribution
such account must be considered as a final account, and the executor or administrator is entitled to his discharge on producing and filing the necessary
vouchers and proofs showing that such payments have been made, and that
he has fully complied with the decree of the court.


SEC. 273. If there is any claim not due, or any contingent or
disputed claim against the estate, the amount thereof, or such part of the
same as the holder would be entitled to if the claim were due, established
or absolute, must be paid into the court, and there remain, to be paid
over to the party when he becomes entitled thereto; or, if he fails to establish his claim, to be paid over or distributed as the circumstances of the estate require. If any creditor whose claim has been allowed, but is not yet
due, appears and assents to a deduction therefrom of the legal interest for
the time the claim has yet to run, he is entitled to be paid accordingly. The
payments provided for in this section are not to be made when the estate is
insolvent, unless a pro rata distribution is ordered.


SEC. 274. When a decree is made by the probate court for the
payment of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally liable to
each creditor for his allowed claim, or the dividend thereon, and execution
may be issued on such decree, as upon a judgment in the district court, in
favor of each creditor, and the same proceeding may be had under such execution as if it had been issued from the district court. The executor or administrator is liable therefor, on his bond, to each creditor.


SEC. 275. When the accounts of the administrator or executor
have been settled, and an order made for the payment of debts and distribution of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not included in the order for
payment has any right to call upon the creditors who have been paid, or upon
the heirs, devisees or legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim;
but if the executor or administrator has failed to give the notice to the creditors, as prescribed in section one hundred and forty-four; such creditor may
recover on the bond of the executor or administrator the amount of his claim,
or such part thereof as he would have been entitled to had it been allowed.
This section shall not apply to any creditor whose claim was not due ten
months before the day of settlement, or whose claim was contingent and did
not become absolute ten months before such day.


SEC. 276. If the whole of the debts have been paid by the first
distribution, the court must direct the payment of legacies and the distribution of the estate among the heirs, legatees, or other persons entitled, as
provided in the next chapter; but if there be debts remaining unpaid, or if,
for other reasons, the estate be not in a proper condition to be closed, the
court must give such extension of time as may be reasonable for a final settlement of the estate.


SEC. 277. At the time designated in the last section, or sooner, if
within that time all the property of the estate has been sold, or there are sufficient funds in his hands for the payment of all the debts due by the estate,
and the estate be in a proper condition to be closed, the executor or administrator must render a final account and pray a settlement of his a dministration.

to which he is entitled, to be given to him upon his giving bonds, with security,
for the.payment of his proportion of the debts of the estate.


SEC. 280. Notice of the application must be given to the executor
or administrator, personally, and to all persons interested in the estate, in
the same manner that notice is required to be given of the settlement of the
account of an executor or administrator.

SEC. 281. The executor or administrator, or any person interested in the estate, may appear at the time named and resist the application,
or any other heir, devisee or legatee may make a similar application for
himself.

SEC. 182. If, at the hearing, it appears that the estate is but little
indebted, and that the share of the party applying, may be allowed to him
without loss to the creditors of the estate, the court must make an order in
conformity with the prayer of the applicant, requiring —

1. Each heir, legatee or devisee obtaining such order, before receiving his
share or any portion thereof, to execute and deliver to the executor or ad-ministrator a bond, in such sum as shall be designated by the probate judge,
with sureties to be approved by the judge, payable to the executor or administrator, and conditioned for the payment, whenever required, of his proportion of the debts due from the estate, not exceeding the value or amount 01
the legacy or portion of the estate to which he is entitled.

2. The executor oradministrator to deliver to the heir, legatee or devisee,
the whole portion of the estate to which he may be entitled, or only a part
thereof, designating it.

more of the parties interested, it must be made in the manner hereinafter
prescribed. The costs of these proceedings to be paid by the applicant, or
if there be more than one, to be apportioned equally amongst them.


SEC. 283. When any bond has been executed and delivered
under the provisions of the preceding section, and it is necessary
for the settlement of the estate to require the payment of any part of the
money thereby secured, the executor or administrator must petition the
court for an order requiring the payment, and have a citation issued and
served on the party bound, requiring him to appear and show cause why the
order should not be made. At the hearing, the court, if satisfied of the necessity of such payment, must make an order accordingly, designating the
amount and giving a time within which it must be paid. If the money is not
paid within the said time allowed, an action may be maintained by the executor or administrator on the bond.

ARTICLE II.

DISTRIBUTION ON FINAL SETTLEMENT.


SEC. 284. Upon the final settlement of the accounts of the executor
or administrator, or at any subsequent time, upon the application of the executor or administrator or of any heir, legatee or devisec, the court must proceed to
distribute the residue of the estate in the hands of the executor or administrator, if any, among the persons who by law are entitled thereto; and if the decedent has left a surviving child, and the issue of other children, and any of them
before the close of administration, have died while under age, and not having
been married, no administration on such deceased child's estate is necessary,
but all the estate which such deceased child was entitled to by inheritance must,
without administration, be distributed to other heirs at law. A statement of
any receipts and disbursements of the executor or administrator, since the
rendition of his iinal accounts, must he reported and filed at the time of
making such distribution, and a settlement thereof, together with an estimate
of the expenses of closing the estate, must be made by the court, and included in the order or decree; or the court or judge may order notice of the
settlement of such supplementary account, and refer the same as in other
cases of the settlement of accounts.


SEC. 285. In the order or the decree, the court must name the
persons and the proportions or parts to which each shall be entitled, and
such persons may demand, sue for, and recover their respective shares from
executor or the administrator, or any person having the same in possession.
Such order or decree is conclusive as to the rights of heirs, legatees or
devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, or modified on appeal.


SEC. 286. Upon application for distribution, after final settlement of the accounts of administration, if the decedent was a non-resident
of this territory, leaving a will which has been duly proved or allowed in the
territory of his residence, and an authenticated copy thereof has been admitted to probate in this territory, and it is necessary in order that the estate,
or any part thereof, may be distributed according to the will, that the estate
in this territory should he delivered to the executor or administrator in the
territory or place of his residence, the court may order such delivery to be
made, and, if necessary, order a sale of the real estate, and a like delivery of
the proceeds. The delivery in accordance with the order of the court is a
full discharge of the executor or administrator with the will annexed, in this
territory in relation to all property embraced in such order, which, unless
reversed on appeal, binds and concludes all parties in interest. Sales of real
estate ordered by virtue of this section must be made in the same manner as
other sales of real estate of decedents by order of the probate court.


SEC. 287. The order or decree may be made on the petition of
the executor or administrator, or of any person interested in the estate.
Notice of the application must be given by posting or publication, as the
court may direct, and for such time as may be ordered. If partition be ap’plied for, as provided in this chapter, the decree of distribution shall not
divest the court of jurisdiction to order partition, unless the estate is finally
closed.

SEC. 288. Before any decree of distribution of an estate is made,
the probate court must be satisfied, by the oath of the executor or administrator, or otherwise, that the territory, county and municipal taxes, legally

levied upon the property of the estate, have been fully paid.

ARTICLE III.

DISTRIBUTION AND PARTITION.


SEC. 289. When the estate, real and personal, assigned by the
decree of distribution to two or more heirs, devisees or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respective shares are not separated and distinguished, partition or distribution may be made by three disinterested persons, to be appointed commissioners for that purpose by the probate court
or judge, who must be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of their duties.
A certified copy of the order of their appointment, and of the order
or decree assigning and distributing the estate, must be issued to them as
their warrant, and their oath must he indorsed thereon. Upon consent of the
parties, or when the court deems it proper and just, it is suiilcient to appoint
one commissioner only, who has the same authority and is governed by the
same rules as if three were appointed.


SEC. 290. Such partition may be ordered and had in the probate
court on the petition of any person interested. But before commissioners
are appointed, or partition ordered by the probate court as directed in this chapter, notice thereof must be given to all persons interested, who reside in
this territory, or to their guardians, and to the agents, attorneys or guardians,
if any in this territory, of such as reside out of the territory, either personally or by public notice, as the probate court may direct. The petition may
be filed, attorneys, guardians and agents appointed, and notice given, at any
time before the order or decree of distribution, but the commissioner must
not be appointed until the order or decree is made distributing the estate.


SEC. 291. If the real estate is in different counties, the probate
court may, if deemed proper, appoint a commissioner for all, or different
commissioners for each county. The estate in each county must be divided
separately among the heirs, devisees or legatees, as if there was no other
estate to be divided, but the commissioner first appointed must, unless otherwise directed by the probate court, make division of such real estate, wherever, situated within this territory.


SEC. 292. Partition or distribution of the real estate may be
made as provided in this chapter, although some of the original heirs, legatees or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such
shares must be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same manner
as they otherwise would have been to such heirs, legatees or devisees.


SEC. 293. When both distribution and partition are made the
several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out to each individual in proportion to his right by metes and bounds or description, so that
the same can be easily distinguished, unless two or more of the parties interested consent to have their shares set out so as to be held by them in common and undivided.


SEC. 294. When the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the probate court may assign the whole
to one or more of the parties entitled to share therein who will accept it,
always preferring the males to the females, and among children preferring the
elder to the younger. The parties accepting the whole must pay to the other
parties interested their just proportion of the true value thereof, or secure
the same to their satisfaction, or, in case of the minority of such party, then
to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true value of the estate must be
ascertained and reported by commissioners. When the commissioners appointed to make partition are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be
divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, they must so report to the court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as herein provided, and must find and report the true value of such real estate. On filing
the report of the commissioners, and on making or securing the payment as
before provided for, the court, if it appears just and proper, must confirm
the report, and thereupon the assignment is complete, and the title to the
whole of such real estate vests in the person to -whom the same is soassigned.


SEC. 295. When any tract of land or tenement is of greater value
than any one's share in the estate to be divided, and it cannot be divided
without injury to the same, it may be set off by the commissioners appointed.
to make partition to any of the parties who will accept it, giving preference
as prescribed in the preceding section. The party accepting must pay or
secure to the others such sums as the commissioners shall award to make the
partition equal, and the commissioners must make their a'ward accordingly;
but such partition must not be established by the court until the sums
awarded are paid to the parties entitled to the same, or secured to their satisfaction.


SEC. 296. When it appears to the court, from the commissioners’
report, that it cannot otherwise be fairly divided, and should be sold, the
court may order the sale of the whole or any part of the estate, real or personal, by the executor or administrator, or by a commissioner appointed for
that purpose, and the proceeds distributed. The sale must be conducted,
reported and confirmed, in the same manner and under the same requirements provided in article four, chapter seven, of this title.


SEC. 297. Before any partition is made or any estate divided, as
provided in this chapter, notice must be given to all persons interested in the
partition, their guardians, agents or attorneys, by the commissioners, of the
time and place, when and where they shall proceed to make partition. The
commissioners may take testimony, order surveys and take such other steps.
as may be necessary to enable them to form a judgment upon the matters before them.


SEC. 298. The commissioners must report their proceedings, and
the partition agreed upon by them, to the probate court, in writing, and the
court may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the report and commit the same to
the same commissioners, or appoint others; and when such report is finally
confirmed, a certified copy of the judgment or decree of partition made
thereon, attested by the clerk, under the seal of the court, must be recorded
in the office of the recorder of the county where the lands lie.


SEC. 299. When the probate court makes a judgment or decree
assigning the residue of any estate to one or more persons entitled to the
same, it is not necessary to appoint commissioners to make partition or distribution thereof, unless the parties to whom the assignment is decreed, or_

some of them, request that such partition be made.


SEC. 300. All questions as to advancements made, or alleged to
have been made, by the decedent to his heirs, may be heard and determined
by the probate court, and must be specified in the decree assigning and distributing the estate; and the final judgment or decree of the probate court,
or, in case of appeal, of the supreme court, is binding on all parties interested

in the estate.

act for such absent person in the distribution. .


SEC. 307. The agent must first give a bond to the probate judge,
