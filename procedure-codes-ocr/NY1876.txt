might confine him in the jail of his own county.

§ 140. If a person confined in or removed to the jail of a
contiguous county, designated as prescribed in this article,

and not exceeding five hundred acres in quantity, must
be laid out as the jail liberties, in a square or rectangle as
nearly as may be; but a stream of Water, canal, street, or
highway, may be adopted as an exterior line, notwithstanding it is not in a straight line, or is not at right angles with
the other exterior lines of the liberties. A resolution
establishing or altering jail liberties, must contain a particular description of their boundaries; and as soon as may be
after its adoption, the boundaries must be designated by
monuments, inclosures, posts, or other visible and permanent marks, at the expense of the county.

§ 148. The county clerk must, Within one week after a,
resolution of the board of supervisors, establishing or alter-:

ing jail liberties, has been filed in his office, deliver an
exemplilied copy thereof to the keeper of the jail; who

public part of the jail, and exhibit it to each person admitted
to the liberties of the jail, at the time of his executing a

bond for that purpose.

§ 149. A person in the custody of a sheriE,. by virtue of
an order of arrest; or of an execution in a civil action; or

§ 150. The bond must be executed by the prisoner,;
and one or more sufflcient sureties, residents, and house-;
holders or freeholders of the county, in a penalty at leastj

twice the sum, in which the sheriff was required to hold the
defendant to bail, if he is in custody under an order of arrest,
or has been surrendered in exoneration of his bail, before
judgment; or directed to be collected by the execution, if
he is in custody under an execution; or remaining uncollected upon a judgment against him, if he has been surrendered after judgment; conditioned, that the person so
in custody shall remain a. prisoner, and shall not, at any

time, or in any manner, escape or go without the liberties

§ 151. A bond so taken is held for the indemnity of the
sheriff taking it, and of the party at whose instance the
prisoner executing it is confined.

§ 152. If a sheriff, who has taken such a bond, discovers that a surety therein is insufficient, he may commit the
‘prisoner who executed it to close confinement in the jail,
until another bond, with good and suiiicient sureties, is

offered.

§ 153. One or more of the sureties, in a bond given for
the liberties of a jail, may surrender the principal, at any
time before judgment is rendered against them in an action

liability incurred before making the surrender.

§ 154. The surrender must be made as follows. The

surrender.

§ 155. The going at large, Within the liberties of the jail
in Which he is in custody, of a prisoner who has executed
such a bond, or of a prisoner Who would be entitled to the
liberties upon executing such a bond, is not an escape. But
the going at large, beyond the liberties, by a prisoner, Without the assent of the party at Whose instance he is in custody, is an escape; and the sheriff in whose custody he. Was,
has the same authority to pursue and retake him, as if he

‘had escaped from the jail. Such an escape forfeits the

bond for the liberties, if any; subject to the provisions of
the next article of this title.

§ 156. Where a person, who has been indicted for a criminal offence, is held by a sheriff, by virtue of a mandate in
a civil action or special proceeding, the court, in which the
indictment is pending, may make an order, requiring the
officer, to whom the process for the arrest of the person
indicted is directed, to take him out of the custody of the
sheriff, and bring him before the court; whereupon the
court may make such disposition of the prisoner, as to it

seems proper. The sheriif must obey such an order.

contempt, or committed for misconduct in a case prescribed
by law, must be actually confined and detained Within the

prescribed by law. A sheriff or keeper of a jail, Who suffers such a prisoner to go or be at large out of his jail;
except by virtue of a Writ of habeas corpus, or by the special
direction of the court committing him, or in a case specially
prescribed by law; is liable to the party aggrieved, for his
damages sustained thereby, and is guilty of a misdemeanor.
If the commitment Was for the non-payment of a sum of
money, the amount thereof, with interest, is the measure of

damages.

§ 158. Where a prisoner, in a sheriff’s custody, goes or is
at large beyond the liberties of the jail, without the assent
of the party at whose instance he is in custody, the sheriff
is answerable therefor, in an action against him, as follows:

1. If the prisoner was in custody by virtue of an order
of arrest, or in consequence of a surrender in exoneration
of his bail, before judgment, the sheriff is answerable to the
extent of the damages sustained by the plaintiff.

mandate, or in consequence of a surrender in exoneration
of his bail, after judgment, the sheriff is answerable for the
debt, damages, or sum of money, for which the prisoner was

a reward, gratuity, or other valuable thing, to procure, assist,
connive at, or permit an escape of a prisoner in his custody,
is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished accordingly. A conviction also operates as a forfeiture of his

office, and disqualiiies him forever thereafter from holding
the same.

171. Defence of sheriff in action for escape.

§ 160. In an action brought by a sheriff on a bond for
the jail liberties, it is a defence, that the prisoner voluntarily

returned to the liberties of the jail from which he escaped,
or was recaptured by, or surrendered to the sheriff, from
whose custody he escaped, before the commencement of
the action. The defendants may make that or any other
defence to the action, which might be made by the sheriff,
to an action against him for the escape.

§ 161. But if judgment has been rendered against the:
sheriff, in an action brought for the escape, and due notice 5
of the pendency of the action was given to the prisoner and i
his sureties, to enable them to defend the same, the judg- 3
ment against the sheriff is conclusive evidence of his right 3
to recover against the prisoner and his sureties, to Whom
the notice was given, as to any matter which Was or might
have been controverted, in the action against the sheriff.

§ 162. In an action brought by a sheri:E on a bond for ;
the jail liberties, if it appears to the court, upon a motion 
made in behalf of the sheriff, that judgment has been rendered against him, for the escape of the prisoner, and that
due notice of the pendency of the action against him, was
given to the prisoner and his sureties, to enable them to
defend the same, the court must order a summary judgment for the plaintiE; and judgment must be entered
accordingly, with costs.

§ 163. But to entitle a sheriff to move for such a judgment, he must have served a copy of his complaint, and:
given twenty days‘ notice of the motion. a

§ 164. If it appears on the hearing of the motion, that»
the defendants have a meritorious defence, Which was not ’
controverted in the action against the sheriff, and which by 
law could not have been so controverted, the court may
stay proceedings on the judgment, with such limitations and
upon such terms, as it deems just,-until a trial in the action ;
but the judgment must stand as a security for the sheriff.

If the defence is established, the court must vacate the
judgment, and render judgment for the defendant.

§ 165. In an action brought by a sheriff on a bond for the
jail liberties, a judgment against him for the escape of the
prisoner, is evidence of the damages sustained by him, as
if it had been collected; and he may recover his reasonable
attorney’s and counsel fees, and other expenses in defending the action against him, as part of his damages.

§ 166. If a bond for the jail liberties is forfeited, the
party at Whose instance the prisoner Was confined, or, in
case of his death, his executor or administrator, is entitled
to an assignment thereof; Which must be executed by the
sheriff who took the bond, or, in case of a vacancy in his
oilice, by his under-sheriff, and acknowledged or proved, and
certiiied, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the

county.

§ 167. The person to whom such an assignment has been
made, may maintain an action on the bond, as assignee of
the sheriff taking the same, in a case Where an action might
be maintained by the sheriff ; and he may recover the same
damages for the breach of the condition, which he might
have recovered in an action against the sheriff, for the

escape.

§ 168. The acceptance of an assignment of such a bond,
is a bar to an action, by or in behalf of the assignee, against
the sheriff or other ofiicer making the same, for an escape
by the prisoner executing the bond, amounting to a breach
of the condition thereof, unless the escape Was with the

assent of the sheriff or other officer.

§ 169. In an action brought by the assignee of the bond,
the defendant may make any defence, which he might

make, if the action was brought in the name and for the
beneht of the sheriif. '

§ 170. If the person entitled to an assignment of a bond
for the jail liberties, in lieu of taking the same, brings
an action against the sheriff for the escape, the court may,
except Where the escape was made with the sheriffs
assent, stay proceedings upon a judgment recovered against
the sheriif, with such limitations and upon such terms as it

§ 173. In a case specilied in the last section, a mandate,
which would be directed to the sherili if he was not a

party, must be directed, either to a particular coroner, or
generally to the coroners of the county. Where a mandate is directed generally to the coroners of a county,
or requires them to do any act, it may be executed, and

be given to a sheriff; and‘ it has the like effect, and may be
assigned and proceeded upon in like manner.

§ 181. A coroner is answerable for an escape of a prisoner admitted by him to the liberties of the jail, in the

amount in controversy.

§ 192. An appeal from an order, under subdivision second

3. Where it is not necessary to the complete determination of the controversy, that all the parties thereto should
be subjected to the jurisdiction of the court, the action or
special proceeding may be discontinued or dismissed, as to

the parties over whom the court has not jurisdiction, and
proceed as to the others, as if they were the only parties
against whom it was brought.

§ 266. The jurisdiction of a superior city court, in an
action or a special proceeding brought therein, must always
be presumed. It is not necessary to set forth in a complaint in such an action, or in the petition or other statement
of the case in such a special proceeding, any of the jurisdictional facts specified in section 263 of this act; and where
the defendant in the action, or the person against whom
the special proceeding is instituted, appears, the want of
jurisdiction, by reason of the non-existence of any of those
facts, is matter of defence, and is waived by the appearance, unless it is pleaded in defence.

§ 267. Where a superior city court has jurisdiction of an
action or special proceeding, it possesses the same jurisdiction, authority, and power, in and over the same, and in the
course of the proceedings therein, which the supreme court
possesses in a like case; and it may render any judgment,
or grant either party any relief, which the supreme court
might render or grant in a like case, and may enforce its
mandates in like manner as the supreme court. And each
judge of the superior city court possesses the same power
and authority, in the action or special proceeding, which a
justice of the supreme court possesses, in a like action or
special proceeding, brought in the supreme court.

§ 268. Each judge of a superior city court also possesses
the same power and authority, in a special proceeding, which
can be lawfully instituted before him, out of court, which a

§ 269. The supreme court may, by an order, made at any
time after joinder of an issue of fact, and before the trial

thereof, remove to itself an action or a special proceeding
pending in a superior city court, for the purpose of changing the place of trial or hearing thereof. Where an order
for a removal is made, as prescribed in this section, the
place of trial or hearing must be changed by the same
order to another county. A certified copy of the order
must be filed in the office of the clerk of the court, in which
the action or special proceeding was commenced. Thereupon it is removed into the supreme court; and the subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if it had
been originally brought in the supreme court.

§ 270. An order for the removal of an action or special
proceeding, as prescribed in the last section, can he made
only upon notice, and by a special term of the supreme
court, where the motion might be made, if the action or
special proceeding was pending in the supreme court, and
brought in the county Where the superior city court is
located; and in a case, Where an order, changing in like
manner the place of trial or hearing, would be granted, if
the action or special proceeding Was pending in the supreme
court.

§ 271. An appeal from an order, made upon such a
motion, must be taken and heard in like manner, as if the
action or special proceeding was pending in the supreme
court, and triable in the county to which the place of trial
is changed. Such an appeal brings up to the general term,
and thence to the court of appeals, if the order is appealable to that court, all questions which were before the
special term, and the appellate tribunal must dispose of the
same, as if they were originally presented to it.

§ 272. An order to stay proceedings, for the purpose of
affording an opportunity to make such an application for
removal, may be made by a judge, authorized to make an

order to stay proceedings, either in the court Where the
action or special proceeding is pending, or in the supreme
court, and with like effect, and under like circumstances.

§ 273. If all the judges of a superior city court are, for
any reason, incapable of sitting upon the trial of an action,
or the hearing of a special proceeding, pending therein, or
if all, or all but one, of the judges of a superior city court
are incapable of sitting upon the hearing of an appeal
therein, the judges of the court, or a majority of them, must
make, and file in the oifice of the clerk of the court, a certificate of the fact. Thereupon the action or special proceeding is removed to the supreme court; and the subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if it had
been originally brought in the supreme court.

§ 274. The supreme court, Where the parties manifest in
Writing their consent, must make an order, directing that
an action or special "proceeding, pending in that court, and
triable in a county Where a superior city court is located, be
removed to the superior city court, or, in the city of NewYork, to either of those courts therein, as specified in the
consent. A certified copy of the order must be filed in the
ofiice of the clerk of the court, to which the action or special
proceeding is ordered to be removed. Thereupon it is
removed accordingly; and all subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if it had been originally brought in
the superior city court.

§ 275. Where an action or special proceeding is removed
from one court to another, as prescribed in this article, the
clerk of the court from which it is removed, must forthwith
deliver to the clerk of the court to which it is removed, all
papers filed therein, and certified copies of all minutes and
entries relating thereto; which must be filed, entered or
recorded, as the case requires, in the ofiice of the last mentioned clerk. If the action or special proceeding is removed

to the supreme court, and the place of trial or hearing
changed, the delivery must be made to the clerk of the
county, in which the order of removal directs the trial or

hearing to be had.

§ 276. The removal of an action or special proceeding, as
prescribed in this article, does not invalidate, or in any
manner impair, a process, provisional remedy or other
proceeding, or a bond, undertaking or recognizance in the
action or special proceeding so removed; each of which continues to have the same validity and effect, as if the removal
had not been made. Where bail has been given, the surrender of the defendant, in the court to which the action
or special proceeding was removed, has the same effect, as a
surrender in the court from which it was removed would
have bad, if the action or special proceeding had remained
therein.

§ 277. In an action or special proceeding, brought in a
superior city court, an order may be made Without notice,
or an order to stay proceedings may be made upon notice,
by the county judge of the county where the court is situated, or of the county where the attorney for the applicant
resides, in a case where a judge of the superior city court
might make the same out of court, and with like effect.

§ 278. A superior city court has power, in "an action or
special proceeding, of which it has jurisdiction, to send its
process and other mandates into any county of the State,
for service or execution, and to enforce obedience thereto,
with like power and authority as the supreme court.

the superior court of Buffalo, or the city court of Brooklyn,

as prescribed by law, With respect to like proceedings, before
a judge of a court of record in the city of New-York.

§ 280. The judges of each superior city court, or a majority of them, must, from time to time, appoint the times
for holding the general, special and trial terms of their
court. They must also assign the judges to hold each of the
terms, and designate the trial terms, at which issues of fact

chambers, and designate the judge to attend for that purpose. Each appointment, made as prescribed in this section. must be signed by the judges making the same, and
filed in the clerk’s office. A copy thereof must be published in the newspaper printed in Albany, in which legal
notices are required to be published, andin two newspapers

of the original, has, presumptively, the effect of the original.

special, or trial terms may be appointed to be held at the
same time. The concurrence of two justices is necessary to
pronounce adecision at a general term. If two do not concur, a re-argument must be ordered. The justices holding

be removed, at pleasure, by the justices thereof, or a majority
of them. He must, by a written instrument under his

the court which the deputy-clerk attends.

§ 330. The clerk may designate asmany of his assistants,
as the justices of the court, or a majority of them, deem necessary, as special deputy-clerks. Each special deputy-clerk

court which he attends, with respect to the business transacted thereat.

§ 331. The clerk must receive, for the use of the city of
N ew-York, the fees allowed by law. He shall not perform

§ 340. The jurisdiction of each county court extends to
the following actions and special proceedings, in addition
to the jurisdiction, power, and authority, conferred upon a
county court, in a particular case, by special statutory pro;
VISIOD :

1. To an action for the partition of real property; for

Who is so incompetent for either of the causes aforesaid, or
who is an infant; or for the sale or other disposition of the
real property, situated Within the county, of a domestic
religious corporation.

§ 341. For the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of

A a county court, in either of the cases specified in the last section, a domestic corporation or joint-stock association,
whose principal place of business is established, by or
pursuant to a statute, or by its articles of association, or is
actually located Within the county, is deemed a resident of
the county; and personal service of a summons, made Within
the county as prescribed in this act, or personal service of a
mandate, whereby a special proceeding is commenced, made
Within the county, as prescribed in this act for personal
service of a summons, is sufficient service thereof upon a
domestic corporation, wherever it is located.

§ 342. If the county judge is, for any cause, incapable to
act in an action or special proceeding, pending in the county
court, he must make, and file in the oiiice of the clerk, a certificate of the fact; and thereupon the special county judge
must act as county judge, in that action or special proceeding,
unless it is removed to the supreme court. If there is no
special county’ judge, the action or special proceeding is
removed to the supreme court, by the filing of the certificate.
The supreme court, at a term held within the judicial district
including the county, upon the application of either party,
made upon notice, and upon proof that the county judge is
incapable to act in an action or special proceeding, may, and,
if the special county judge is also incapable to act, must,
make an order, removing the action or special proceeding to
the supreme court. Where an action or special proceeding
is removed to the supreme court, as prescribed in this section,
the subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if
it had been originally brought in that court, except that an
objection to the jurisdiction may.be taken, which might have
been taken'in the county court.

§ 343. The supreme court may, by an order, made at any
time after joinder of an issue of fact, and before the trial
thereof, remove to itself an action brought in a county
court, under subdivision second or subdivision third of the
last section but two, for the purpose of changing the place
of trial thereof. Where an order for removal is made, as
prescribed in this section, the place of trial of the action
must be changed by the same order to another county, and
the subsequent proceedings therein must be the same, as if
the action had been originally brought in the supreme court.

§ 344. An order of removal, made as prescribed in either
of the last two sections, takes effect upon the entry thereof
in the ofiice of the county ‘clerk. Where the order directs
that the action be tried in another county, the clerk with
whom it is entered, must forthwith deliver to the clerk of
that county, all papers filed therein, and certified copies of

all minutes and entries relating thereto; which must be
tiled, entered, or recorded, as the case requires, in the oflice
of the last mentioned clerk. The provisions of section 271
of this act apply to an appeal taken from such an order.

§ 345. An order to stay proceedings, for -the purpose of
affording an opportunity to make the application for removal, may be made by the county judge, or by a judge
authorized to make such an order in the supreme court, and

prescribed in this title, does not invalidate, or in any manner
impair, a process, provisional remedy, or other proceeding, or a bond, undertaking, or recognizance in the action
or special proceeding so removed; each of which continues
to have the same validity and effect, as if the removal had
not been made. Where bail was given, the surrender of
the defendant in the supreme court has the same effect, as
a surrender in the county court would have had, if the action or special proceeding had remained therein.

§ 347. A county court has power, in an action or special

'proceeding of which it has jurisdiction, to send its process

and other mandates into any county of the State, for service
or execution, and to enforce obedience thereto, with like
power and authority as the supreme court.

§ 348. Where a county court has jurisdiction of an action or a special proceeding, it possesses the same jurisdiction, power and authority in and over the same, and in the
course of the proceedings therein, which the supreme court

possesses in a like case; and it may render any judgment, or
grant either party any relief, which the supreme court might
render or grant in a like case, and may enforce its mandates
in like manner as the supreme court. And the county

judge possesses the same power and authority, in the action
or special proceeding, which a justice of the supreme court
possesses, in a like action or special proceeding, brought in
the supreme court.

§ 349. The county judge also possesses the same power
and authority, in a special proceeding which can be lawfully
instituted before him out of court, which a justice of the
supreme court possesses in a like special proceeding, instituted before him in like manner.

§ 350. Upon the application of a person, who has been
fined by a court, or of a person whose recognizance has become forfeited, or of his surety, the county court of the
county in which the term of the court was held, where the
fine was imposed or the recognizance taken, may, except as
otherwise prescribed in the next section, upon good cause
shown, and upon such terms as it deems just, make an order
remitting the fine, wholly or partly, or the forfeiture of the
recognizance, or part of the penalty thereof; or it may discharge the recognizance. If a fine so remitted has been

paid, the county treasurer, or other ofiicer, in whose hands

the money remains, must pay the same, or the part remitted,
according to the order.

§ 351. The last section does not authorize a county court,
to remit any part of a fine, exceeding two hundred and
fifty dollars, imposed by a court of oyer and terminer, or
a court of sessions, upon a conviction for a criminal offence;
or a fine, to any amount, imposed by a court upon an omcer
or other person, for an actual contempt of court, or for disobedience to its process or other mandate ; or to remit or discharge a recognizance taken in its county, for
the appearance of a person in another county. In the latter case, the power of remitting or discharging the recognizance is vested in the county court of the county, in which
the person is bound to appear. =

§ 352. An application for an order, as prescribed in the
last section but one, cannot be heard, until such notice
thereof as the court deems reasonable, has been given to the
district-attorney of the county, and until he has had an
opportunity to examine the matter, and prepare to resist
the application. And upon granting such an order, the
court must always impose, as a condition thereof, the payment of the costs and ‘expenses, if any, incurred in an action
or special proceeding for the collection of the line, or the
penalty of the recognizance.

§ 353. Where a person has been fined by a court of special sessions, or by a justice of the peace, upon ‘a conviction
for an offence, and has been committed to jail for non-payment of the fine, the county court of the county may make
an order remitting the fine, wholly or partly, and discharging him from his imprisonment. The power conferred by
this section must be exercised in the manner prescribed, and
subject to the provisions contained, in the last three sections.

§ 354. In an action or special proceeding in a county
court, an order may be made without notice, or an order to
stay proceedings may be made upon notice, by a justice of
the supreme court, or by the county judge of the county
where the attorney for the applicant resides, in a case Where
the county judge, in whose court the action or special proceeding is brought, may make the same out of court, and
with like effect.

§ 355. The county court is always open for the transaction of any business, for which notice is not required to be
given to an adverse party, except where it is specially prescribed by law, that the business must be done at a stated

  term. The county judge must, from time to time, appoint
the times and places for holding terms of his court. At
least two terms, for the trial of issues of law or of fact, must
be appointed to be held in each year. Each term may continue as long as the county judge deems necessary. The
county judge may, by a new appointment, change the day
appointed for holding a term, or appoint one or more additional terms, or dispense with the holding of a term, Without aifecting any other term or terms theretofore appointed
to be held. As many terms as the county judge designates
for that purpose, in an appointment, may be held for the
hearing and decision of motions, and trials and other proceedings, without a 

§ 356. Each appointment, made as prescribed in the last section, must be filed in the county clerk’s oflice, and a copy
thereof published at least once in each week, for three successive weeks before a term is held, changed, or dispensed
with by virtue thereof, in the newspaper in the city of
Albany, in which legal notices are required to be published,
and also in at least one newspaper published in the county,
and as many additional newspapers published therein as
the county judge prescribes. The expense of the publication is a county charge.

§ 357. Jurors for the terms of the county court, at which
issues of fact are triable by jury, and of the court of sessions, must be drawn and notified in the same manner as

sessions; and, when his services are not required therein, he

must attend the surrogate’s court, upon the request of the
surrogate.

§ 360. The stenographer, appointed as prescribed in the
last section, may, with the consent either of the county judge
or of the surrogate, appoint an assistant-stenographer, to aid
him in the discharge of his duties, Whose compensation shall
be paid by the stenographer, and is not a county charge.

§ 361. The judge holding or presiding at a term of the
county court or court of sessions, in the county of Livingston

§ 400. The last section, excluding the provision requiring

therefor, and a judgment therein is reversed on appeal,
without awarding a new trial, or the action is terminated

in any other manner than by a voluntary discontinuance, a
dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the
action, or a final judgment upon the merits; the plaintiff,
or, if he dies, and the cause of action survives, his representative, may commence a new action for the same cause,

1. Where the right grows out of the receipt or detention

of money or property, by an agent, trustee, attorney; or

other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, the time must
be computed from the time, when the person, having the
right to make the demand, has actual knowledge of the
facts, upon which that right depends.

2. Where there was a deposit of money, not to be repaid
at a fixed time, but only upon a special demand, or a delivery
of personal property, not to be returned, specifically or in
kind, at a tixed time or upon a fixed contingency, the time
must be computed from the demand.

submission is revoked, so as to render it ineffectual, by the

against whom the action might have been brought; or the
execution thereof, or the remedy upon an award or other
determination thereunder, is stayed by injunction, or other

answer, in support of which he would be entitled to «rely, =

his favor, the remedy upon which, at the time of the com-=
mencement of the action, was not barred by the provisions
of this chapter; and the complaint is dismissed, or the
action is discontinued, or abates in consequence of the plaintiff’s death; the time which intervened, between the commencement and the termination of the action, is not a part
of the time, limited for the commencement of an action by
the defendant, to recover for the cause of action so interposed

as a defence, or to interpose the same defence in another
action brought by the same plaintiff, or a person deriving title from or under him.

§ 413. The objection, that the action was not commenced
within the time limited, can be taken only by answer. The
corresponding objection to a defence or counterclaim can be
taken only by reply; except where a reply is not required,
in order to enable the plaintiff to raise an issue of fact, upon
an allegation contained in the answer.

§ 414. The provisions of this chapter apply, and constitute the only rules of limitation applicable, to a civil action
or special proceeding, except in one of the following cases:

1. A case, where a different limitation is specially prescribed by law, or a shorter limitation is prescribed by the

any proceeding therein, «or to pursue a remedy upon a
judgment, where he commences, institutes, or otherwise
resorts to the same, before the expiration of two years after

of law applicable thereto, immediately before this act takes
effect, continue to be so applicable, notwithstanding the
repeal thereof.

4. A case, where the time to commence an action has
expired, when this act takes effect.

The word, “action,” contained in this chapter, is to be
construed, when it is necessary so to do, as including a
special proceeding, or any proceeding therein, or in an
action.

§ 415. The periods of limitation, prescribed by this chapter, except as otherwise specially prescribed therein, must be computed from the time of the acruing of the right to relief by action, special proceeding, defence, or otherwise, as the case requires, to the time when the claim to that relief is actually interposed by the party, as a plaintiff or defendant, in the particular action or special proceeding.

copy of his demurrer or answer upon the plaintiffs attorney,
before the expiration of the time, Within which the summons requires him to appear.

§ 423. Where a personal claim is not made against a
defendant, a notice, subscribed by the plaintiff’s attorney,
setting forth the general object of the action, a brief description of the property affected by it, if it affects specific

made against him, may be served with the summons. If
the defendant so served, unreasonably defends the action,
costs must be awarded against him.

§ 424. A voluntary general appearance of the defendant
is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

3. In any other case, to the defendant in person.

§ 427. If the defendant is an infant of the age of fourteen
years, or upwards, or if the court has, in its opinion, reason» able ground to believe, that the defendant, by reason of

habitual drunkenness, or for any other cause, is mentally
incapable adequately to protect his rights, although not
judicially declared to be incompetent to manage his affairs,
the court may, in its discretion, with or without an application therefor, and in the defendant’s interest, make an order,
requiring a copy of the summons to be also delivered, in
behalf of the defendant, to a person designated in the order,
and that service of the summons shall not be deemed complete, until it is so delivered.

§ 428. In a case specified in subdivision first or second of

that, for any reason, he is not a tit person to protect the
rights of the defendant, it may likewise make an order, as
prescribed in the last section. In a case specified in subdivision second, the court may, as a part of the same order, or
by a separate order, made, in like manner and upon like
ground, at any stage of the action, appoint a special guardian ad litem to conduct the defence for the incompetent
defendant, to the exclusion of the committee, and with the
same powers, and subject to the same liabilities, as a committee of the property.

§ 429. Where the defendant has been judicially declared
to be incompetent to manage his affairs, in consequence of
lunacy, and it appears satisfactorily to the court, by ailidavit, that the delivery of a copy of the summons to him, in
person, will tend to aggravate his disorder, or to lessen the
probability of his recovery, the court may make an order,
dispensing with such delivery. In that case, a delivery of a
copy of the summons, to a committee duly appointed for
him, is sufiicient personal service upon the defendant.

§ 430. A resident of the State, of full age, may execute,
under his hand, and acknowledge, in the manner required
by law to entitle a deed to be recorded, a written designation
of another resident of the State, as a person upon whom to
serve a summons, or any process or other paper for the commencement of a civil special proceeding, in any court or
before any oflicer, during the absence from the United
States of the person making the designation ; and may file
the same, with the written consent of the person so designated, executed and acknowledged in the same manner, in
the office of the clerk of the county, where the person making
the designation resides. The designation must specify the
occupation, or other proper addition, and the residence of the
person making it, and also of the person designated: and it
remains in force during the period specified therein, if any;
or, if no period is specified for that purpose, for three years
after the filing thereof. But it is revoked earlier, by the
death or legal incompetency of either of the parties thereto;
or by the filing of a revocation thereof, or of the consent,
executed and acknowledged in like manner. The clerk must
lile and record such a designation, consent, or revocation;
and must note, upon the record of the original designation,
the filing and recording of a revocation. While the designation remains in force, as prescribed in this section, a summons,
or any process or other paper for the commencement of a
civil special proceeding, against the person making it, in any
court or before any oflicer, may be served upon the person
so designated, in like manner and with like effect, as if it was
served upon the person making the designation, notwithstanding the return of the latter to the United States.

§ 431. Personal service of the summons upon a defendant, being a domestic corporation, must be made by delivering a copy thereof, as follows:

1. If the action is against the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New-York, to the mayor, comptroller,
or counsel to the corporation.

2. If the action is against any other city, to the mayor,
treasurer, counsel, attorney, or clerk; or, if the city lacks
either of those officers, to the omcer performing corresponding functions, under another name.

3. In any other case, to the president or other head of the
corporation, the secretary or clerk to the corporation, the
cashier, the treasurer, or a director or managing agent.

§ 432. Personal service of the summons, Within the State,
upon a defendant, being a foreign corporation, must be made
by delivering a copy thereof, as follows:

1. To the president, treasurer, or secretary; or, if the corporation lacks either of those officers, to the oiiicer performing corresponding functions, under another name.

2. To a person designated for the purpose by a writing,
under the seal of the corporation, and the signature of its
president, vice-president, or other acting head, accompanied
with the written consent of the person designated, and filed
in the omce of the secretary of State. The designation
must specify a place, within the State, as the office or residence of the person designated; and, if it is within a city,
the street, and street number, if any, or other suitable
designation of the particular locality. It remains in force,
until the filing in the same oiiice of a Written revocation
thereof, or of the consent executed in like manner; but the
person designated may, from time to time, change the place
specified as his oflice or residence, to some other place Within
the State, by a writing, executed by him. and filed in like
manner. The secretary of State may require the execution
of any instrument, specified in this section, to be authenticated as he deems proper, and he may refuse to file it without
such an authentication. An exemplified copy of a designation so filed, accompanied with a certificate that it has not
been revoked, is presumptive evidence of the execution
thereof, and conclusive evidence of the authority of the
officer executing it.

3. If such a designation is not in force, or if neither the
person designated, nor an officer specified in subdivision
first of this section,’ can be found with due diligence, and
the corporation has property within the State, or the cause
of action arose therein ; to the cashier, a director, or agent
of the corporation, or a person doing business for it, within
the State.

§ 433. The provisions of this article, relating to the mode
of service of a summons, apply likewise to the service of
any process or other paper, whereby a special proceeding is
commenced in a court, or before an ofiicer, except a proceeding to punish for contempt, and except where special provision for the service thereof is otherwise made by law.

§ 434. Proof of service, as prescribed in this article, must
be made by afhdavit, except as follows:

1. If the service was made by the sheriff, it may be
proved by his certificate thereof.

2. Ifthe defendant served is an adult, who has not been
judicially declared to be incompetent to manage his affairs,
the service may be proved by a written‘ admission, signed
by him, and either acknowledged by him, and certified in
like manner as a deed to be recorded in the county, or
accompanied with the aflidavit of a person, other than the
plaintiff, showing that the signature is genuine.

A certificate, admission, or affidavit of service of a summons, must state the time and place of service. A written
admission of the service of a summons, or of a paper accompanying the same, imports, unless otherwise expressly stated
therein, or otherwise plainlyto be inferred from its contents,

that a copy of the paper was delivered to the person signing
the. admission.

§ 435. Where a summons is issued from the supreme
court, an order for the service thereof, as prescribed in the
next section, upon a defendant residing Within the State,
may be made by the court, or a judge thereof, or the county
judge of the county Where the action is triable, upon satisfactory proof, by the aflidavit of a person, not a party to the
action, or by the return of the sheriff of the county Where
the defendant resides, that proper and diligent effort has
been made to serve the summons upon the defendant, and
that the place of his sojourn cannot be ascertained, or, if he
is within the State, that he avoids service, so that personal
service cannot be made.

§ 436. The order must direct, that the service of the

summons be made, by leaving a copy thereof, and of the

order, at the residence of the defendant, with a person

of proper age, if upon reasonable application, admittance
can be obtained, and such a person found who will receive

it; or, if admittance cannot be so obtained, or such a person found, by aiiixing the same to the outer or other door
of the defendant’s residence, and by depositing another copy

thereof, properly inclosed in a post-paid wrapper, addressed
to him, at his place of residence, in the post-office at the

place where he resides.

§ 437. The order, and the papers upon which it was
granted, must be filed, and the service must be made, within
ten days after the order is granted; otherwise the order
becomes inoperative. On filing an affidavit, showing service

according to the order, the summons is deemed served, and
the same proceedings may be taken thereupon, as if it had
been served by publication, or by delivery to the defendant
without the State, pursuant to an order for that purpose,
made as prescribed in the next section.

§ 438. An order, directing the service of a summons upon
a defendant, without the State, or by publication, may be
made in either of the following cases:

1. Where the defendant to be served is a foreign corporation; or, being a natural person, is not a resident of the

remains in force; or service upon the person so designated
cannot be made Within the State, after diligent effort.

4. Where the defendant is a resident of the State, and
the complaint demands judgment annulling a marriage, or
for a divorce, or a separation.

5. Where the defendant is a resident of the State, or a
domestic corporation, and the complaint demands udgment,
that the defendant be excluded from a vested or contingent
interest in, or lien upon, specific real or personal property
within the State; or that such an interest or lien in favor
of either party be enforced, 1'egula.ted, defined, or limited;
or otherwise affecting the title to such property.

6. Where the defendant is a resident of the State, or a
domestic corporation; and an attempt was made to commence the action against the defendant, as required in chapter fourth of this act, before the expiration of the limitation applicable thereto, as fixed in that chapter; and the
limitation would have expired, within sixty days next preceding the application, if the time had not been extended by
the attempt to commence the action.

7. Where the action is against the stockholders of a corporation, or joint-stock company, and is authorized by a law
of the State, and the defendant is a stockholder thereof.

§ 439. The plaintiff, when he applies for the order, must
present to the judge a verified complaint, showing that he
is entitled to the judgment demanded, against the defendant to be served; and, where the application is made
under subdivision fourth or fifth of the last section, that
the judgment is of the character therein specified. If a
material allegation of the complaint, entitling the plaintiff
to the judgment demanded, is not made upon the knowledge
of the person verifying, other satisfactory proof thereof
must be made by affidavit. Proof by aflidavit must also be
made of the additional facts, required by the last section;
and, where the application is made under subdivision first,
fourth, fifth or seventh thereof, the order shall not be
granted, unless the judge is satisfied, by the papers presented, that the plaintiff has been or will be unable, with
due diligence, to make personal service of the summons

within the State.

§ 440. The order may be made by a judge of the court,
or the county judge of the county where the action is triable. It must direct that service of the summons, upon the
defendant named or described in the order, be made by

publication thereof in two newspapers, designated in the
order as most likely to give notice to the defendant, for a
specified time, which the judge deems reasonable, not less
than once a week for six weeks; or, at the option of the

plaintiff, by service of the summons, and of a copy of the
complaint and order, upon the defendant personally, Without the State; or, if the defendant is a corporation, upon an
omcer thereof, specified in section 432 of this act. It must
also contain, either a direction, that, on or before the day
of the lirst publication, the plaintiff deposit in a specified
post-office, one or more sets of copies of the summons, complaint and order, each contained in a securely closed postpaid Wrapper, directed to the defendant, at a place specified
in the order; or a statement that the judge, being satisfied,
by the af1"1davits upon which the order was granted, that
the plaintiff cannot, with reasonable diligence, ascertain a
place or places, Where the defendant would probably receive
matter transmitted through the post-office, dispenses with

the deposit of any papers therein.

§ 441. The first publication, pursuant to the order, or the
service upon the defendant, Without the State, must be made
Within three months after the order is granted. For the
purpose of reckoning the time, Within Which the defendant
must appear or answer, service by publication is complete,
at the expiration of the time prescribed for publication,
reckoning from the first publication ; and service made Without the State is complete, upon the expiration thereafter of

a time equal to that prescribed for publication.

order Was made, must be filed With the clerk, on or before
the day of the first publication; and a notice, subscribed by

.day of , 18 , and filed with the complaint. The
service will be complete, at the expiration of from

the first day of publication.”

§ 443. Where service is made without the State, the papers
specified in the last section must be previously filed; and a
notice must be served with the summons, in all respects like
the notice required by the last section, except that the words,
“without the State of New-York ”, must be substituted for
the words, “by publication”; and the words, “ day of your
receipt of this notice”, must be substituted for the words,
“ first day of publication”.

§ 444. Proof of the publication of the summons and
notice must be made by the afhdavit of the printer or
publisher, or his foreman or principal clerk. Proof of deposit in the post-oflice, or of delivery, of a paper required
to be deposited or delivered by the provisions of this article,
must be made by the atlidavit of the person, who deposited
or delivered it.

§ 445. Where the summons is served, pursuant to an order
made as prescribed in this article, the defendant so served, or
his representative, on application and sufficient cause shown,
at any time before fmal judgment, must be allowed to defend the action; and, except in an action for divorce, the
defendant, or his representative, must, in like manner,

upon good cause shown, and upon just terms, be allowed
to defend, after linal judgment, at any time within one year
after service of written notice thereof; or, if such a notice has
not been served, within seven years after the liling of the
judgment-roll. If the defence is successful, and the judgment, or any part thereof, has been collected or otherwise
enforced, such restitution may thereupon be compelled, as
the court directs; but the title to property, sold, to a pur
chaser in good faith, pursuant to a direction contained

in the judgment, or by virtue of an execution issued upon
the same, shall not be affected thereby.

§ 446. All persons having an interest in the subject of

the action, and in obtaining the judgment demanded, may
be joined as plaintiffs, except as otherwise expressly prescribed in this act.

§ 447. Any person may be made a defendant, who has
or claims an interest in the controversy, adverse to the plaintiff, or who is a necessary party defendant, for the complete
determination or settlement of a question involved therein;
except as otherwise expressly prescribed in this act.

§ 448. Of the parties to the action, those who are united
in interest must be joined as plaintiffs or defendants, except
as otherwise expressly prescribed in this act. But if the consent of any one, who ought to be joined as a plaintiff, cannot
be obtained, he may be made a defendant, the reason therefor being stated in the complaint. And where the question
is one of a common or general interest of many persons; or
where the persons, who might be made parties, are very
numerous, and it may be impracticable to bring them all
before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the

benefit of all.

§ 449. An executor or administrator, a trustee of an
express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute,
may sue, without joining with him the person for whose
benefit the action is prosecuted. A person, with whom or

in whose name, a contract is made for the benefit of another,
is a trustee of an express trust, Within the meaning of this section.

§ 450. In an action or special proceeding, a married woman
appears, prosecutes, or defends, alone or joined with another,
as if she was single.

§ 451. Where the plaintiff is ignorant of the name or
lpart of the name of a defendant, he may designate that
- defendant, in the summons, and in any other process or proceeding in the action, by a fictitious name, or by as much of
his name as is known, adding a description, identifying the
person intended. Where the plaintiff demands judgment
against an unknown person, he may designate that person
as unknown, adding a description, tending to identify him.
In either case, the person intended is thereupon regarded as
a defendant in the action, and as sufiiciently described
therein, for all purposes, including service of the summons,
as prescribed in article second of the last title; and for
that purpose, an unknown person is deemed not to be a
resident of the State. When the name, or the remainder
of the name, or.the person, becomes known, an order must
be made by the court, upon such notice and such terms as
it prescribes, that the proceedings already taken be deemed
amended, by the insertion of the true name, in place of the

fictitious name or part of a name, or the designation as an
unknown person; and that all subsequent proceedings be
taken under the true name.

§ 452. The court may determine the controversy, as
between the parties before it, where it can do so without
prejudice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights;
but where a complete determination of the controversy
cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the
court must direct them to be brought in. And where a
person, not a party to the action, has an interest in the subject thereof, or in real property, the title to which may in
any manner be affected by the judgment, and makes application to the court to be made a party, it must direct him
to be brought in by the proper amendment.

§ 453. Where the court directs a new defendant to be
brought in, and the order is not made upon his own application, a supplemental summons must be issued, directed
to him, and in the same form as an original summons; except
that, immediately after the direction, it must briefly recite
the occasion of issuing it, and that, in the body thereof, it
must require the defendant to answer the original or the
amended complaint, and the supplemental complaint, or
either of them, as the case requires. And each provision
of this chapter, relating to personal service, or a substitute
for personal service of an original summons, applies to such
a supplemental summons. 5

brought upon the instrument, or by a party thereto to recover against other parties liable over to him; or severally
liable for the same demand, and, without reckoning offsets or
counterclaims, in the same amount, although upon different
instruments; may, all or any of them, be included as defendants in the same action, at the option of the plaintiff.

§ 455. The joinder of a person, as defendant in an action,
with another person, as prescribed in the last section, does

not affect his right to any order or relief, to which he would

have been entitled, if he had been separately sued in the
action.

§ 456. Where a summons, issued against two or more defendants, alleged to be severally liable, is served upon some,
but not upon all of them, the plaintiff may proceed against
those upon whom it is served, as if they were the only defendants named therein. Where it is served upon all of them, the
plaintiff may take judgment against one or more of them,
where he would be entitled to judgment, if the action was
against him or them alone. Where judgment is so taken,
the clerk must, upon the plaintiif’s application, enter an order,
directing that the action be severed, and that the plaintiff
may proceed against the other defendants.’ In any subsequent proceeding, the plaintiff may use, together with a
certified copy of such an order, a copy of a paper constituting a part of the judgment-roll, with like effect as if it
was the original.

§ 457. The last three sections do not affect a defence or
other objection of a defendant, growing out of the failure to join in the action two or more persons jointly liable;
and, as regards the other parties to the action, persons jointly

liable are regarded as one party, for every purpose contemplated by those sections.

that he has examined the case, and is of opinion that the
applicant has a good cause of action.

satisfied of the truth of the facts alleged, and that the applicant has a good cause of action, may, by order, admit him to
prosecute as a poor person, and assign to him an attorney
and counsel to prosecute his action, who must act therein
Without compensation.

§ 461. A person so admitted, may prosecute his action,

‘Without paying fees to any officer; and he shall not be prevented from prosecuting the same, by reason of his being
liable for the costs of a former action, brought by him
against the same defendant. If judgment is rendered
against him, or his complaint is dismissed, costs shall not
be awarded against him.

§ 462. If the person so admitted is guilty of improper
conduct in the prosecution of his action, or of wilful or
unnecessary delay, the court may, in its discretion, annul
the order admitting him to prosecute as a poor person; and
he shall thereafter be deprived of all the privileges con
ferred thereby.

§ 463. A defendant in an action involving his right, title,

the court, in which the action is pending, for leave to defend
the action as a poor person, and to have an attorney and

be appointed to appear as his guardian for the purpose of
the action, who shall be responsible for the costs thereof.

§ 470. The guardian must be appointed upon the application of the infant, if he is of the age of fourteen years, or
upwards; or, if he is under that age, upon the application
of his general or testamentary guardian, if he has one, or of
a relative or friend. If the application is made by a rela
tive or friend, notice thereof must be given to his general
or testamentary guardian, if he has one; or, if he has none,

after service of the summons; or, if he is under that age, or
neglects so to apply, upon the application of any other
party to the action, or of a relative or friend of the infant.

judge thereof, or, if the action is brought in the supreme
court, the county judge of the county where the action is

the appointment.

§ 473. In an action for the partition of real property, 01
for the foreclosure of a mortgage, where an infant defendant resides without the State, or is temporarily absent
therefrom, the court may, in its discretion, make an order
designating a person to be his guardian ad litem, unless he,
or some one in his behalf, procures such a guardian to be
appointed, as prescribed in the last two sections, within a
specified time after service of a copy of the order. The
court must give special directions in the order, respecting
the service thereof, which may be upon the infant.

§ 474. Except in a case where it is otherwise specially
prescribed by law, a guardian, appointed for an infant, as

given sufficient security, approved by a judge of the
court, or a county judge, to account for and apply the same,
under the direction of the court.

penalty as the judge directs, not less than twice the sum,

penalty; or the court may so direct, of its own motion.

§ 476. The last two sections do not apply to the general
guardian of the infant, who has been appointed his guardian
ad litem as prescribed in this article; but the court may, at
any time, require the general guardian to give additional

receiving money or property of the infant, under a judgment or order in the action.

§ 477. A person appointed guardian, as prescribed in this article, for an infant defendant in an action, is not liable for

486. When alternative legal or equitable judgment may he demanded.

§ 478. The first pleading, on the part of the p1aintiR, is

t the complaint.

§ 479. If a copy of the complaint is not delivered to a
defendant, at the time of the delivery of a copy of the summons to him, either within or without the State, his attorney may, at any time before the plaintiif is entitled to apply
for judgment against him, for want of an answer, serve upon
the plaintifs attorney a written demand of a copy of the
complaint, which must be served within twenty days thereafter. The_ demand may be incorporated into the notice of
appearance. But where the same attorney appears for two
or more defendants, only one copy of the complaint need be
served upon him; and if an attorney appears for a defendant,
after service of a copy of the complaint on him as attorney
for another defendant, the last defendant must answer the
complaint, within twenty days after his appearance.

§ 480. If the plaintiE’s attorney fails to serve a copy of
the complaint, as prescribed in the last section, the defendant may apply to the court for a dismissal of the complaint.

§ 481. The complaint must contain:

1. The title of the action, specifying the name of the
court in which it is brought; if it is brought in the supreme
court, the name of the county, which the plaintiff designates as the place of trial; and the names of all the parties
to the action, plaintiff and defendant.

2. A plain and concise statement of the facts, constituting
each cause of action, without unnecessary repetition.

3. A demand of the judgment to which the plaintiff supposes himself entitled.

§ 482. In an action triable by the court, without a jury,
the plaintiff may, in a proper case, demand an interlocutory
judgment, and also a final judgment, distinguishing them
clearly. In an action triable by a jury, he must demand a
final judgment only ; and, if judgment for a sum of money
only is demanded, the amount thereof must be stated.

§ 483. Where the complaint sets forth two or more causes
of action, the statement of the facts constituting each cause
of action must be separate and numbered.

§ 484. The plaintiif may unite, in the same complaint,
two or more causes of action, whether they are such as

were formerly denominated legal or equitable, or both,
where they are brought to recover as follows :

1. Upon contract, express or implied.

2. For personal injuries, except libel, slander, criminal
conversation, or seduction.

3. For libel or slander.

4. For injuries to real property.

5. Real property, in ejectment, with or without damages
for the withholding thereof.

6. For injuries to personal property.

7. Chattels, with or without damages for the taking or
detention thereof.

8. Upon claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract,
or by operation of law.

9. Upon claims arising out of the same transaction, or
transactions connected with the same subject of action, and
not included within one of the foregoing subdivisions of
this section.

But it must appear, upon the face of the complaint, that
all the causes of action, so united, belong to one of the foregoing subdivisions of this section; that they are consistent with
each other; and, except as otherwise prescribed by law, that
they affect all the parties to the action: it must not appear,
upon the face of the complaint, that they require different
places of trial: and the judgment demanded thereupon
must be such, that issues of fact, arising upon the allegations of the complaint, will not require different modes of

trial.

§ 485. Where all the relief, for which the complaint
demands judgment, might have been awarded, in one action,
by the court of chancery, on the 31st day of December,
1846, the cause of action is deemed single; although separate actions might be maintained, upon the facts set forth
in the complaint, in each of which a portion of the same
relief might be awarded.

§ 486. Where a plaintiff sets forth, in his complaint,
facts, showing that he has a good cause of action, but the
character of the judgment to which he is entitled, with
respect to its being of the kind formerly denominated legal
or equitable, depends upon facts, which, he alleges, by
reason of his imperfect knowledge thereof, he cannot set
forth, he may state those facts alternatively, and thereupon
demand each kind of judgment, in the alternative. In such
a case, the cause of action is deemed single; the complaint
must always be verified; and the statement of the facts,
upon which the character of the judgment thus depends,
must show, that the plaintiff is entitled to one of the alternative judgments: but the plaintiffs want of knowledge,
with respect to those facts, is not the subject of an issue.

ARTICLE SECOND.

§ 488. The defendant may demur to the complaint, where
one or more of the following objections thereto appear
upon the face thereof:

1. That the court has not jurisdiction of the person of
the defendant.

2. That the court has not jurisdiction of the subject of
the action.

3. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue.

constitute a cause of action.

9. That the facts stated in the complaint do not entitle
the plaintiff to the judgment demanded.

10. That the plaintiff demands judgment for two or more
inconsistent kinds of relief.

§ 489. But the last section does not allow a demurrer,
under subdivision ninth thereof, where it appears, from the
complaint, that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for a
greater or less sum of money than he has stated, or for
other greater or less relief, of the same general character
as that which he has demanded; or, under subdivision tenth
thereof, where he is allowed, by section 486 of this act, to
demand judgment in the alternative.

§ 490. The demurrer must distinctly specify the objections to the complaint; otherwise it may be disregarded.
An objection, taken under subdivision first, second, fourth
or eighth of the last section but one, may be stated in
the language of the subdivision; an objection, taken under
either of the other subdivisions, must point out specifically
the particular defect relied upon, and show how the case
comes within the subdivision.

§ 491. If the demurrer specifies objections, arising under
two or more subdivisions of section 488 of this act, and the
court determines that it was well taken, under one or more
of the subdivisions thus specified, but not under the others,

the judgment upon the demurrer must be for the defendant;
but neither party is entitled to the costs of the demurrer.

§ 492. The defendant may demur to the whole complaint, or to one or more separate causes of action, stated
therein. In the latter case, he may answer the causes of:

action not demurred to.

§ 493. The defendant may also demur to the reply, or to
a separate traverse to, or avoidance of, a defence or counter-‘

claim, contained in the reply, on the ground that it is insuf-t

ticient in law, upon the face thereof.

§ 494. The plaintiff may demur to a counterclaim or a
defence consisting of new matter, contained in the answer,
on the ground that it is insuflicient in law, upon the face

thereof.

§ 495. The plaintiff may also demur to a counterclaim:
upon which the defendant demands an affirmative judgment,

where one or more of the following objections thereto,

appear on the face of the counterclaim:

1. That the court has not jurisdiction of the subject:

thereof.
2. That the defendant has not legal capacity to recover

upon the same.
3. That there is another action pending between the

same parties, for the same cause.

4. That the counterclaim is not of the character specified
in section 501 of this act.

5. That the counterclaim does not state facts sufHcient to
constitute a cause of action.

6. That the facts stated in the counterclaim do not entitle the defendant to the judgment demanded.

7. That the defendant demands judgment for two or
more inconsistent kinds of relief.

§ 496. A demurrer, taken under the last section, must distinctly specify the objections to the counterclaim; otherwise
it may be disregarded. The mode of specifying the objections is the same, as where a demurrer is taken to a complaint ; and each provision of this chapter, relating to or
affecting a demurrer, based upon an objection to the demand
of judgment contained in a complaint, applies to a demurrer
taken under subdivision sixth or seventh of the last section.

§ 497. Upon the decision of a demurrer, either at a general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, allow

' the party in fault to plead anew or amend, upon such terms

as are just. If a demurrer to a complaint is allowed,
because two or more causes of action have been improperly
united, the court may, in its discretion, and upon such
terms as are just, direct that the action be divided into as
many actions, as are necessary for the proper determination
of the causes of action therein stated.

§ 498. The defendant may set forth, in his answer, facts,
which, if they appeared upon the face of the complaint,
would render it, or a separate cause of action contained
therein, subject to a demurrer, as prescribed in this article;
and thereupon he may have the same advantage thereof,
as if the objection was taken by demurrer. '

§ 499. If such an objection is not taken, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant is deemed to have waived it;
except the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, or
the objection that the complaint does not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a cause of action.

§ 500. Where the defendant controverts all the allegations of the complaint, his answer must contain a general
denial of each and every allegation thereof, or an allegation
that he has not sufiicient knowledge or information to form

a belief, with respect to any allegation contained therein.
Where he controverts a portion of the allegations thereof,

his answer must contain, either a specific denial of each
allegation controverted, or an allegation that he has not
suflicient knowledge or information, to form a belief, with
respect to any of the matters stated therein. The answer
may also. set forth new matter, constituting one or more
defences or counterclaims, in ordinary and concise language,
without repetition.

§ 501. The counterclaim, specified in the last section,
mustbe one of the following causes of action against the
plaintiff, or, in a proper case, against the person whom he
represents, and in favor of the defendant, or of one or more
defendants, between whom and the plaintiff a separate judgment may be had in the action:

1. A cause of action, arising out of the contract or transaction, set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the
plaintiff ’s claim, or connected with the subject of the

action.
2. In an action on contract, any other cause of action on

contract, existing at the commencement of the action.

§ 502. But the counterclaim, specified in subdivision
second of the last section, is subject to the following rules:

1. If the action is founded upon a contract, which has
been assigned by the party thereto, other than a negotiable
promissory note or bill of exchange, a demand, existing
against the party thereto, or an assignee of the contract, at
the time of the assignment thereof, and belonging to the
defendant, in good faith, before notice of the assignment,
must be allowed as a counterclaim, to the, amount of the
plaintiif’s demand, if it might have been so allowed
against the party, or the assignee, while the contract
belonged to him.

2. If the action is upon a negotiable promissory note or
bill of exchange, which has been assigned to the plaintiff
after it became due, a demand, existing against a person
who assigned or transferred it, after it became due, must
be allowed as a counterclaim, to the amount of the plaintiff ’s demand, if it might have been so allowed against the
assignor, while the note or bill belonged to him.

3. If the plaintiff is a trustee for another, or if the
action is in the name of a plaintiff, who has no actual interest in the contract upon which it is founded, a demand
against the plaintiff shall not be allowed as a counterclaim;
but so much of a demand existing against the person whom
he represents, or for whose benefit the action is brought, as
will satisfy the plaintiffs demand, must, except in a case
specified in the next subdivision, be allowed as a counterclaim, if it might have been so allowed in an action brought
by the person beneficially interested.

4. If the action is brought by a receiver, or by the
trustee of an insolvent or imprisoned debtor, a counterclaim shall not be allowed, except where it is specially prescribed by law, that the defendant may set off a demand in
his favor, against a demand in favor of the person or corporation, represented by the plaintiff.

§ 503. Where a counterclaim is established, which equals
the plaintiff ’s demand, the judgment must be in favor of

the defendant. Where it is less than the plaintiffs demand, ,
the plaintiff must have judgment for the residue only. 1
Where it exceeds -the plaintiif’s demand, the defendant 1
must have judgment for the excess, or so much thereof as
is due from the plaintiff. Where part of the excess is not
due from the plaintiff, the judgment does not prejudice the
defendant’s right to recover, from another person, so much
thereof as the judgment does not cancel. In a case specified in this section, the amount of the counterclaim established must be stated in the judgment.

§ 504. In a case not specified in the last section, Where a
counterclaim is established, Which entitles the defendant,
to an affirmative judgment, demanded in the answer, I
judgment must be rendered for the defendant accordingly.

§ 505. In an action against an executor or an administrator, or other person sued in a representative capacity,
the defendant may set forth, as a counterclaim, a demand
belonging to the decedent, or other person Whom he represents, Where the person so represented would have been
entitled to set forth the same, in an action against him.

§ 506. In an action brought by an executor or administrator, in his representative capacity, a demand against the
decedent, belonging to the defendant at the time of his death,
may be set forth by the defendant as a counterclaim, as if
the action had been brought by the decedent in his life.
time ; and, if a balance is found to be due to the defendant,
judgment must be rendered therefor against the plaintiE,
in his representative capacity. Execution can be issued
upon such a judgment, only in a case Where it could be
issued upon a judgment, in an action against the executor
or administrator.

§ 507. A defendant may set forth, in his answer, as
many defences or counterclaims, or both, as he has, Whether

they are such as were formerly denominated legal or equitable; but they must not be inconsistent with each other.
Each defence or counterclaim must be separately stated,
and numbered. Unless it is interposed as an answer to the
entire complaint, it must distinctly refer to the cause of
action which it is intended to answer.

§ 508. A partial defence may be set forth, as prescribed
in the last section; but it must be expressly stated to be a
partial defence to the entire complaint, or to one or more
separate causes of action, therein set forth. Upon a demurrer thereto, the question is, whether it is sufficient for that
purpose. This section does not apply to matters tending
only to mitigate or reduce damages, in an action to recover
damages for the breach of a promise to marry, or for a
personal injury, or an injury to property.

§ 509. Where the defendant deems himself entitled to
an aflirmative judgment against the plaintiff, by reason of
a counterclaim interposed by him, he must distinctly demand
the judgment in his answer; and he may demand judgment
in the alternative, in a case and subject to the regulations,
prescribed in this title, with respect to a like demand in the
complaint.

§ 510. If, upon a demurrer to a counterclaim, upon which

the defendant demands an afiirmative judgment, the court
determines, that the matter of the counterclaim is sufficient

to defeat the cause of action, but not to entitle the defendant to an aflirmative judgment, the demurrer must be sustained; but the court may, in its discretion, and upon such
terms as it deems just, permit the demand for an affirmative
judgment to be stricken out.

§ 511. Where a part of the plaintiff’s claim, which may be
severed from the remainder, is admitted upon the pleadings,
the court, upon the plaintifl:"s motion, must order that the

action be severed; that a judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the part so admitted; and, if the plaintiff so elects,
that the action be continued, with like effect, as to the
subsequent proceedings, as if it had been originally brought
for the remainder of the claim. The order must prescribe
the time and manner of the plaintiffs election. If the
plaintiff elects to continue the action, his right to costs upon
the judgment is the same, as if it was taken in an action
brought only for that part of the claim; but the defendant
is not entitled to costs in any event. If the plaintiff does
not elect to continue the action, costs must be awarded, as
upon final judgment in any other case.

§ 512. In an action upon contract, where the complaint
demands judgment for a sum of money only, if the defendant, by his answer, does not deny the plaintiff’s claim, but
sets up a counterclaim amounting to less than the plaintiffs
claim, the plaintiff, upon filing with the clerk an admission
of the counterclaim, may take judgment for the excess, as
upon a default for want of an answer. The admission
must be made a part of the judgment-roll.

§ 513. A defence, which does not involve the merits of
the action, shall not be pleaded, unless it is verified as
prescribed in title second of this chapter.

515. Judgment upon failure to reply.
516. Cases where the court may require a reply. .
517. Plaintiff may set forth several avoidances in reply.

§ 514. Where the answer contains a counterclaim, the
plaintiff, if he does not demur, may reply to the counterclaim. Where he controverts all the allegations of the
counterclaim, the reply must contain a general denial of
each and every allegation thereof, or an allegation that he

has not suiiicient knowledge or information, to form a belief,

with respect to any allegation contained therein. ‘ Where he
controverts a portion of the allegations, his reply must contain, either a specific denial of each allegation controverted
by him, or an allegation that he has not suiiicient knowledge
or information, to form a belief, with respect to any of the
matters stated therein. The reply may also set forth, in
ordinary and concise language, without repetition, new
matter, not inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a
defence to the counterclaim.

§ 515. If the plaintiff fails to reply or demur to the
counterclaim, the defendant may apply, upon notice, for
judgment thereupon; and,'if the case requires it, a reference
may be ordered, or a writ of inquiry may be issued, as prescribed in chapter eleventh of this act, where the plaintiif
applies for judgment.

§ 516. Where an answer contains new matter, constituting a defence by way of avoidance, the court may, in its

discretion, on the defendant’s application, direct the plaintiff to reply to the new matter. In that case, the reply, and
the proceedings upon failure to reply, are subject to the
same rules as in the case of a counterclaim.

§ 517. A reply may contain two or more distinct avoidances of the same defence or counterclaim; but they must
be separately stated and numbered, and must not be inconsistent with each other.

action in a court of record; and prescribes the form thereof,
and the rules by which the sufficiency thereof is determined,
except where special provision is otherwise made by law.

§ 519. The allegations of a pleading must be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the
parties.

§ 520. A pleading must be subscribed by the attorney
for the party. A copy of each pleading, subsequent to the
complaint, must be served on the attorney for the adverse
party, within twenty days after service of a copy of the
preceding pleading.

§ 521. Where the judgment may determine the ultimate
rights of two or more defendants, as between themselves, a
defendant, who requires such a determination, must demand

it in his answer, and must, at least ten days before the trial,
serve a copy of his answer upon the attorney for each of
the defendants, to be affected by the determination. The
controversy between the defendants shall not delay a judgment, to which the plaintiff is entitled ; unless the court
otherwise directs.

§ 522. Each material ‘allegation of the complaint, not
controverted by the answer, and each material allegation of
new matter in the answer, not controverted by the reply,
where a reply is required, must, for the purposes of the
action, be taken as true. But an allegation of new matter
in the answer, to which a reply is not required, or of new
matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted by the
adverse party, by traverse or avoidance, as the case requires.

§ 523. Where a pleading is verified, each subsequent
pleading, except a demurrer, or the general answer of an
infant by his guardian ad litem, must also be verified. But
the verification may be omitted, in a case where it is not
otherwise specially prescribed by law, where the party
pleading would be privileged from testifying, asxa witness,
concerning an allegation or denial contained in the pleading. A pleading cannot be used, in a criminal prohecution
against the party, as proof of a ‘fact admitted or alleged

therein.   
§ 524. The allegations or denials in a verified pleading

must, in form, be stated to be made by the party pleading.
Unless they are therein stated to be made upon the infor.

mation and belief of the party, they must be regarded, for

all purposes, including a criminal prosecution, as having
been made upon the knowledge of the person verifying the
pleading. An allegation that the party has not sufiicient
knowledge or information, to form a belief, with respect to
a matter, must, for the same purposes, be regarded as the
allegation of the person verifying the pleading.

§ 525. The verification must be made by the affidavit of
the party, or, if there are two or more parties united in
interest, and pleading together, by at least one of them,
who is acquainted with the facts, except as follows:

1. Where the party is a domestic corporation, the verification must be made by an oflicer thereof.

2. Where the people of the State are, or a public ofiicer,
in their behalf, is the party, the verification may be made by
any person acquainted with the facts.

3. Where the party is a foreign corporation; or where
the party is not Within the county where the attorney resides, and capable of making the afiidavit; or, if there are
two or more parties united in interest,~and pleading together,
where neither of them, acquainted with the facts, is within
that county, and capable of making the affidavit; or where

the action or defence is founded upon a written instrument
for the payment of money only, which is in the possession

of the agent or the attorney; or where all the material allegations of the pleading are Within the personal knowledge
of the agent or the attorney; in either case, the verification
may be made by the agent of or the attorney for the party.

§ 526. The afiidavit of verification must be to the effect,
that the pleading is true to the knowledge of the deponent,
except as to the matters therein stated to be alleged on
information and belief, and that as to those matters he
believes it to be true. Where it is made by a person, other
than the party, he must set forth, in the afiidavit, the grounds
of his belief, as to all matters not stated upon his knowledge, and the reason why it is not made by the party.

§ 527. Where the complaint is not verified, and the

answer sets up a counterclaim, and also a defence by way;
of denial or avoidance, the affidavit of verification may be;
made to refer exclusively to the counterclaim. In that case, ”

the last three sections are applicable to the ailidavit and the
counterclaim, as if the latter was a separate pleading.

§ 528. The remedy for a defective verification of a pleading is to treat the same as an unverified pleading. Where

the copy of a pleading is served without a copy of a sufiicient verification, in a case where the adverse party is
entitled to a verified pleading, he may treat it as a nullity,
provided he gives notice, with due diligence, to the attorney of the adverse party, that he elects so to do.

§ 529. A defendant is not excused from verifying his
answer to a complaint, charging him with having confessed

»or suffered a judgment, or executed a conveyance, assignment, or other instrument, or transferred or delivered money,
or personal property, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
his creditors; or with being a party or privy to such a
transaction by another person, with like intent towards the
creditors of that person ; or with any fraud whatever, affecting a right or the property of another.

§ 530. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived
therefrom, it is suiiicient to designate the statute by its title and the day of its passage, or in some other manner
with convenient certainty, without setting forth any of the
contents thereof.

§ 531. It is not necessary for a party to set forth, in a
pleading, the items of an account therein alleged; but in that
case, he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days
after a written demand thereof, a copy of the account,
which, if the pleading is verified, must be verified by his
afhdavit, to the effect, that he believes it to be true; or,
if the facts are within the personal knowledge of the
agent or attorney for the party. or the party is not within
the county where the attorney resides, or capable of making
the aflidavit, by the aiiidavit of the agent or attorney. If
he fails so to do, he is precluded from giving evidence of
the account. The court, or a judge authorized to make an
order in the action, may direct the party to deliver a further

account, -where the one delivered is defective. The court

may, in any case, direct a bill of the particulars of the claim
of either party to be delivered to the adverse party.

§ 532. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of i

a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary
to state the facts conferring jurisdiction; but the judgment or
determination may be stated to have been duly given or
made. If that allegation is controverted, the party pleading must, on the trial, establish the facts conferring jurisdiction

§ 533. In pleading the performance of a condition precedent in a contract, it is not necessary to state the facts constituting performance ; but the party may state, generally,
that he, or the person Whom he represents, duly performed
all the conditions on his part. If that allegation is controverted, he must, on the trial, establish performance.

§ 534. Where a cause of action, defence, or counterclaim,
is founded upon an instrument for the payment of money
only, the party may set forth a copy of the instrument, and
state that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse
party, a specified sum, which he claims. Such an allegation
is equivalent to setting forth the instrument, according to
its legal effect.

§ 535. It is not necessary, in an action for libel or slander,
to state, in the complaint, an extrinsic fact, for the purpose
of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter; but the plaintiff may state, generally, that it
was published or spoken concerning him; and, if that allegation is controverted, the plaintiff must establish it on the
trial. In such an action, the defendant may prove mitigating circumstances, notwithstanding that he has pleaded or
attempted to prove a justification.

§ 536. In an action to recover damages for the breach of
a promise to marry, or for a personal injury, or an injury
to property, the defendant may prove, at the trial, facts, not
amounting to a total or partial defence, tending to mitigate
or otherwise reduce the plaintiE’s damages, if they are
separately set forth in an answer, containing a defence to
the entire cause of action; but not otherwise. A defendant, in default for want of an answer, may, upon a reference
or inquiry to ascertain the amount of the plaintiffs damages, prove facts of that description.

§ 537. A party, who has demurred to a pleading, or to a

“ separate cause of action, counterclaim, or defence consisting of

new matter, may, before taking any other proceeding thereupon, serve upon the attorney for the adverse party, a notice
of at least five days, that the demurrer will be brought to
trial, upon the ground of the frivolousness of the pleading
or part of the pleading demurred to, before a judge of the
court, either in court.or out of court. A demurrer may be
noticed for trial in like manner, upon the ground of the
frivolousness of the demurrer. If the judge determines that
the pleading or part of the pleading demurred to, or the
demurrer, as the case requires, is frivolous, judgment must
be given upon the demurrer, as if the trial had taken place
at a term of the court. If the judge determines that it is
not frivolous, an appeal cannot be taken from his decision;
and the issue of law, arising upon the demurrer, must be
tried, upon full notice, at the proper term. Upon an appeal
from a judgment, rendered upon a determination that the
pleading, or part of the pleading, demurred to, or the
demurrer, is frivolous, the question is, whether the demurrer
was well taken.

§ 538. A sham answer or a sham defence may be stricken
out by the court, upon motion, and upon such terms as the
court deems just.

§ 539. A variance, between an allegation in a pleading
and the proof, is not material, unless it has actually misled

the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his
action or defence, upon the merits. If a party insists that
he has been misled, that fact, and the particulars in which
he has been misled, must be proved to the satisfaction of
the court. Thereupon the court may, in its discretion,
order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as it
deems just. 

§ 540. Where the variance is not material, as prescribed

in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found
according to the evidence, or may order an immediate
amendment, without costs.

§ 541. Where, however, the allegation to which the proof
is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or particulars
only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it is not a case
of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure of
proof.

§ 542. Within twenty days after a pleading, or the answer or demurrer thereto, is served, or at any time before the
period for answering it expires, the pleading may be once
amended by the party, of course, without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had. But if it is
made to appear to the court, that the pleading was amended
for the purpose of delay, and that the adverse party will
thereby lose the benefit of a term, for which the cause is
or may be noticed, the amended pleading may be stricken
out, or the pleading may be restored to its original form,
and such terms imposed as the court deems just.

§ 543. Where a pleading is amended, as prescribed in the
last section, a copy thereof must be served upon the attorney for the adverse party. A failure to demur to, or answer
the amended pleading, within twenty days thereafter,
has the same effect as a like failure to demur to, or answer

the original pleading.

§ 544. Upon the application of either party, the court
may, and, in a proper case, must, upon such terms as are
just, permit him to make a supplemental complaint, answer
or reply, alleging material facts which occurred after his
former pleading, or of which he was ignorant when it was
made; including the judgment or decree of a competent
court, rendered after the commencement of the action,
determining the matters in controversy, or a part thereof’.
The party may apply for leave to make a supplemental
pleading, either in addition to, or in place of, the former
pleading. In the latter event, if the application is granted,
a provisional remedy, or other proceeding already taken in
the action, is not affected by the supplemental pleading;
but the right of the adverse party to have it vacated or set
aside, depends upon the case presented by the original and
supplemental pleadings.

§ 545. Within twenty days after service of a copy of
the complaint, or within ten days after service of a copy of
an answer or reply, the adverse party may serve, upon the
attorney subscribing the pleading, an exception thereto, on
the ground that it contains irrelevant, redundant or scandal.
ous matter; or a denial or allegation which is so indefinite
or uncertain, that the precise meaning or application thereof
is not apparent; or that the form or contents of the pleading fail, in any respect, for which another remedy is not
expressly prescribed by law, to comply with a requirement
of this act, or of the general rules of practice. The exception must specify distinctly each objection to the pleading;
and, also, if an objection relates to a particular allegation or
denial contained therein, the particular paragraph or other
portion deemed objectionable. The exception does not
operate as a stay of proceedings, or an extension of the time
to answer the pleading, or to take any other proceeding in
the action, unless an order therefor is procured; and the
exception cannot be heard, after judgment in the action.

§ 546. The party, whose pleading is excepted to, may,
within ten days after service of the exception, amend the
pleading, and serve a copy of the amended pleading upon
the attorney for the exceptant. If he does not so amend it,
in all the particulars objected to, he may, Within the same
time, serve a notice, of not less than five days, that the
exception Will be heard upon the objections, or the remaining objections, as the case requires, at a special term, or
before a judge of the court, at a place where a motion may
be made in the action. If he notices the exception for
hearing, the attorney for the exceptant may serve a notice
of hearing, of not less than two days, for the same time and
place. After ten days have elapsed, if the party, whose
pleading is excepted to, has not amended it in all the particulars specified in the exception, and has not noticed the
exception for hearing, the exceptant may serve a like notice
of hearing, of not less than five days. An exception may
be taken to a pleading amended under this section, in like
manner and With like effect, as to the pleading first excepted to; but a pleading once so amended cannot be again
amended, Without the special leave of the court.

§ 547. Upon the hearing of the exception, the court may
direct, that the pleading excepted to, or any portion thereof
pointed out by the exception, be stricken out, upon such
terms, and With such privilege of amendment, as are just.
Costs, not exceeding the amount taxable upon a demurrer,
may be directed to be paid by either party; or, where scandalous matter is stricken out, by the attorney whose name
is subscribed to the pleading.

1. To recover a fine or penalty. ,

recover damages for so obtaining, receiving, paying, converting, or disposing of the same.

The cases, provided for in this section, are described in
this act, as cases where the right to arrest the defendant
depends upon the nature of the action.

§ 550. A defendant_ may also be arrested in an action, as
prescribed in this title, in either of the following cases:

1. Where it appears, from the complaint, that the action
is to recover a chattel; and, by allegations extrinsic to the
complaint, that the chattel, or a part thereof, has been

is to recover damages for the taking, detention, or conversion of personal property; and, by allegations extrinsic to
the complaint, that the defendant has fraudulently concealed or disposed of the property, or some part thereof.
But, in an action to recover a chattel, a claim for damages,

corporation or banking association, in the course of his
employment; or by a factor, agent, broker, or other person
in a fiduciary capacity. But this subdivision does not apply
to an action to recover a chattel.

5. Where it appears, from the complaint, that the judgment demanded requires the performance of an act, the
neglect or refusal to perform which would be punishable
by the court as for a contempt; and, by allegations extrinsic
to the complaint, that the defendant is not a resident of the
State, or, being a resident, is about to depart therefrom, by
reason of Which non-residence or departure, there is danger,
that a judgment or an order, requiring the performance of
the act, will be rendered ineffectual.

is always in its discretion; and may be granted or served,
either before or after final judgment, unless an appeal fron;

given, sufficient to stay the execution thereof. In either of
the other cases specified in the last two sections, the order
cannot be served after final judgment; but it must be
granted, wh ere a proper case therefor is presented, at any
time before final judgment. '

§ 552. The recovery of judgment in a court, not of the
State, for the same cause of action; or, where the action is
founded upon fraud or deceit, for the price or value of the
property obtained thereby ; does not affect the right of the
plaintiff to arrest the defendant, as prescribed in this title.

§ 553. A woman cannot be arrested, as prescribed in this title, except in a case where the order can be granted only
by the court; or where it appears, from the complaint, that

§ 556. To entitle the plaintiff to cause the defendant to
be arrested, as prescribed in the last article, he must procure
an order for the arrest of the defendant. Except in a case
specified in subdivision fifth of section 550 of this act, the
order may be granted, out of court or in court, by a judge
of the court in which the action is brought, or by any

county judge.

§ 557. The order may be granted, in a case Where the
right to arrest the defendant depends upon the nature of
the action, where it appears, by the aflidavit of the plaintiif, or of another person, that a sufiicient cause of action
exists against the defendant. In either of the other cases,
specified in the last article, the order may be granted,
Where it appears, upon the like proof, that a suiiicient
cause of action exists, and that the extrinsic allegations,
thereby required to be made, are true in fact. The adidavit may also contain any statement, tending to determine

the amount of bail to be required.

§ 558. Subject to the provisions of the last article,
the order may be granted at any time, after the commencement of the action. It may also be granted, to accompany
the summons; in which case, a complaint need not be presented upon the application therefor, but, for the purpose
of determining whether the order was properly granted, a
complaint, thereafter made, must be regarded as having
been made at the time of the application.

§ 559. Except Where the action is brought for a cause
specified in subdivision third of section 549 of this act, or
in a case where it is specially prescribed by law that security
may be dispensed with, or the security to be given is
specially regulated by law, the judge, before he grants the
order, must require a Written undertaking on the part of
the plaintiff, with or without sureties, to the eEect, that, if
the defendant recovers judgment, the plaintiff will pay all
costs which may be awarded to the defendant, and all
damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, not
exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which must
be at least one hundred dollars. ’

§ 560. Where the order can be granted only by the
court, an undertaking on the part of the plaintiff may
be dispensed With. If it is required, its form, and the
security to be given thereupon, must be such as the court

prescribes.

§ 561. The order, except Where it is granted by the court,
must be subscribed by the plaintiffs attorney, and by the
judge. It must briefly recite the ground of arrest. It
may be directed, either to the sheriff of a particular county,
or, generally, to the sheriff of any county. It must require
the sheriff forthwith to arrest the defendant, if he is found
within his county; to hold him to bail in a specified sum;
and to return the order, with his proceedings thereunder, as
prescribed by law. The plaintiff's attorney may, at his
option, by an indorsement upon the order, or, where it was

granted by the court, upon the copy thereof, delivered to the
sheriff, fix a time Within which the defendant must be
arrested. In that case, he cannot be arrested afterwards.

§ 562. The order of arrest, or, where it was granted by
the court, a certified copy thereof, subscribed by the
plaintiffs attorney; and, in either case, the papers upon
which the order was granted; must be delivered to the
sheriff, Who, upon arresting the defendant, must deliver
to him copies thereof. The papers, upon which the order
was granted, must be filed, with the order of arrest, or a
certified copy thereof, at the time prescribed for  the
same, in sections 577 and 590 of this act.

§ 563. The sheriff must execute the order by arresting
the defendant, if he is found Within his county, and keeping him in custody until discharged by law.

§ 564. This title does not abridge or affect an existing
privilege from arrest, or a right of action for a breach
thereof. A privileged person is entitled to be discharged
from arrest, Where other provision is not made therefor by
law, by the court, or a judge thereof; or by the county
judge of the county, or a judge of a superior city court of
the city, where the arrest was made. The order must be
made, upon proof, by aliidavit, of the facts entitling the
applicant to the discharge; and the arrest and discharge
are not a bar to a new arrest, after the privilege has ceased.
The court or judge may make the order Without notice, or
may require notice to be given to the sheriff, or to the
plaintiff, or to both.

§ 565. An officer of a court of record, appointed or elected
pursuant to law, is privileged from arrest, during the actual
sitting, which he is required to attend, of a term of the
court of which he is an officer, and no longer; but an
attorney or counsellor is not thus privileged, unless he is
employed in a cause, to be heard at that term.

§ 566. Except where an order of arrest can be granted;
only by the court, a defendant, arrested before answer, has:
twenty days, after the arrest, in which to answer the com-}
plaint; and judgment must be stayed accordingly. j

§ 567. Except where an order of arrest can be granted
only by the court, a defendant, arrested as prescribed in this title, may, at any time before final judgment, or, if he was
arrested within twenty days before final judgment, at any
time within twenty days after the arrest, apply to vacate
the order of arrest; or to reduce the amount of bail; or to
increase the security given by the plaintiff; or for one or
more of those forms of relief, together, or in the alternative.
If the application is for two or more of those forms of relief,
it must be regarded, for the purposes contemplated by the
next four sections, as so many separate motions. In a case
where the order of arrest can be granted only by the court,
a like application may be made, at any time within twenty
days after the arrest; and an application to increase the

security given by the plaintiff, may be made at any time
before final judgment. ‘

§ 568. An application, specified in the last section, may
be founded only upon the papers upon which the order was
granted; in which case, it must be made to the court, or, if
the order was granted by a judge out of court, to the same
judge, in court or out of court, and with or without notice,
as he deems proper. Or it may be founded upon proof, by
afiidavit, on the part of the defendant; in which case, it
must be made to the court, or, if the order was granted by
a judge, out of court, to any judge of the court, upon notice;
and it may be opposed by new proof, by affidavit, on the
part of the plaintiff, tending to sustain any ground of arrest
recited in the order, and no other, unless the defendant relies upon a discharge in bankruptcy, or upon a discharge or
exoneration, granted in insolvent proceedings; in which
case, the plaintiff may show any matter in avoidance
thereof, which he might show upon the trial.

§ 569. Upon the hearing of such an application, the
court or judge must assume the truth of each allegation of
the complaint, which is essential to sustain the order of
arrest, and respecting which there is conflicting evidence;
although a conflict of evidence may be taken into consideration, for the purpose of fixing the amount of bail, or of
the security to be given by the plaintiff.

§ 570. In a case, where the plaintiffs right to arrest the
defendant depends partly upon allegations extrinsic to the
complaint, the truth of those allegations must be determined,
as a question of fact, by the court or judge, upon the application to vacate the order of arrest. But the hearing may
be adjourned, to enable the parties to procure further evidence, either by afiidavit, or by deposition taken before a
referee, appointed for that purpose, by the court or judge.

§ 571. The granting or denial of such an application,
founded only upon the papers upon which the order of arrest
was granted, does not prejudice a subsequent application,
seasonably made, founded upon proof, by affidavit, on the
part of the defendant; and the granting or denial of either
application does not prejudice a subsequent application,
seasonably made, founded upon the failure of a complaint,
which had not been made at the time of the former application, to set forth a cause of action, sufficient to entitle
the plaintiff to the order of arrest, upon a ground recited
therein.

§ 572. Except In a case Where an order of arrest can be
granted only by the court, if the defendant is in actual
custody, and the plaintiff neglects to enter judgment in the
action, Within one month after it is in his power to do so; or
neglects to issue execution against the person of the defendant, within three months after the entry of judgment; the
defendant must, on his application, made upon notice to the
plaintiff, be discharged from custody, by the court in which
the action Was commenced, or by a judge thereof, Within

the county Where the defendant is in custody; unless it is
shown, that the neglect was with the express assent, or was
caused by the act or procurement, of the defendant or his
attorney. A defendant, discharged as prescribed in this section, shall_ not be arrested, upon an execution issued

upon a judgment in the action.

§ 573. The defendant, at any time before he is in contempt, where the order can be granted only by the court, or,
in any other case, at any time before execution against his
person, must be discharged from arrest, either upon giving
bail, or upon depositing the sum specified in the order of
arrest. The defendant may give bail, or make the deposit,
immediately upon his arrest, at any hour of the day or
night; and he must have reasonable opportunity to seek

for and to procure bail, before being committed to jail.

§ 574. Where the defendant is actually confined in the jail,
by virtue of an order of arrest and final or interlocutory

judgment has been rendered against him in the action, but
an execution against his person has not been issued, he may
elect, either to give a bond for the liberties of the jail, or to
give bail or make a deposit, as prescribed in this article.

§ 575. The defendant may give bail, by delivering to the
sheriff a written undertaking, in the sum specified in the
order of arrest, executed by two or more suliicient bail,
stating their places of residence and occupations, to the following effect:

1. If the order of arrest could be granted only by the
court, that the defendant will obey the direction of the
court, or of an appellate court, contained in an order or a
judgment, requiring him to perform the act specified in the
order; or, in default of his so doing, that he will, at all
times, render himself amenable to proceedings to punish
him for the omission.

2. If the action is to recover a chattel, that the defendant will deliver it to the plaintiff, if delivery thereof is
adjudged in the action, and will pay any sum recovered
against him in the action.

3. In any other case, that the defendant will, at all times,
render himself amenable to any mandate, which may be
issued to enforce a final udgment against him in the action.

§ 576. The officer, taking the acknowledgment of the
undertaking, must, if the sheriE so requires, examine under
oath, to a reasonable extent, the persons offering to become
bail, concerning their property and their circumstances.

The examination must be reduced to Writing, subscribed by

the bail, and annexed to the undertaking; and a copy thereof
must be delivered to the plaintiffs attorney, with a copy of
the undertaking, as prescribed in the next section.

§ 577. Within three days after bail is given, the sheriff

A must file with the clerk, the order of arrest, with his return

thereon indorsed; the papers upon which the order of arrest

was granted; and the undertaking of the bail. Within the
same time, he must deliver to the p1aintiii"s attorney, copies,
certified by him, of the order of arrest, return, and undertaking. The plaintiff ’s attorney, within ten days thereafter,
must serve upon the sheriff a notice that he does not accept
the bail ; otherwise he is deemed to have accepted them, and
the sheriff is exonerated from liability. Where an order of
arrest, directing the arrest of two or more defendants, has
been executed as to some, but not as to all of them, the
sheriff may file a copy of the order of arrest. instead of the

original.

§ 578. Within ten days after the receipt of the notice, the
sheriff or the defendant may serve upon the plaintiffs attorney, notice of the ‘justification of the same or other bail,
specifying the place of residence and occupation of each of the
latter, before a judgeof the court, or a county judge, at a
speciiied time and place; the time to be not less than five
nor more than ten days thereafter, and the place to be within
the county where one of the bail resides, or where the
defendant was arrested. If other bail are given, a new
undertaking must be executed, as prescribed in section 575
of this act.

§ 579. The qualifications of bail are as follows:

1. Each of them must be a resident of, and a householder
or freeholder within the State.

2. Each of them must be worth the sum specified in the
order of arrest, exclusive of property exempt from execution ; but the judge, on justification, may allow more than
two bail to ustify, severally, in sums less than that specified
in the order, if the whole justification is equivalent to that
of two sufficient bail. "

§ 580. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail
must attend before the judge, at the time and place mentioned in the notice, and be examined on oath, on the part
of the plaintiff, touching his sufliciency, in such manner as
the judge, in his discretion, thinks proper. The judge may,

in his discretion, adjourn the examination from day to day,
until it is completed; but such an adjournment must always
be to the next judicial day, unless by consent of parties.
If required by the plaintiff's attorney, the examination must
be reduced to writing, and subscribed by the bail.

§ 581. If the judge finds the bail suflicient, he must annex
the examination to the undertaking, indorse his allowance
thereon, and cause them to be filed with the clerk. The
sheriff is thereupon exonerated from liability.

§ 582. The defendant may, instead of giving bail, deposit
with the sherilf the sum specified in the order. The sheriff
must thereupon give the defendant a certificate of the
deposit, and discharge him from custody.

§ 583. The sheriff must, within four days afterlthe deposit,
pay it into court. He must take, from the ollicer receiving it, two certificates of the payment, one of which he must
deliver to the plaintiff, and the_other to the defendant. For
a default in making the payment, the official bond of the
sheriff may be prosecuted, as in any other case of delinquency.

§ 584. If money is deposited, as prescribed in the last two sections, bail may be given, and may justify upon notice, at
any time before the expiration of the right to be discharged
on bail. Thereupon the judge, before whom the justification
is had, must direct, in the order of allowance, that the
money deposited be refunded to the defendant, or his representative, and it must be refunded accordingly.

§ 585. If money deposited is not refunded, as prescribed
in the last section, it is, in a case where the order of arrest
could be granted only by the court, subject to the direction
of the court, as justice requires, before and after the judgment. In any other case, if it remains on deposit, when
final judgment is rendered for the plaintiff, it must be

applied, under the direction of the court, in satisfaction of
the judgment; and the surplus, if any, must be refunded
to the defendant, or his representative. If the final judgment is for the defendant, or the action abates, or is discontinued, the sum deposited, and remaining unapplied,
must be refunded to the defendant or his representative.

§ 586. At any time before the deposit is paid into court,
the defendant may deliver to the sheriff a written direction,
to pay it to a third person, therein specified, in the event
that the defendant becomes entitled to a return thereof; but
without expressing any other contingency. The direction
must be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in like
manner as a deed to be recorded; and the sheriff must
deliver it to the officer who receives the deposit, who must
note the substance thereof, with the entries of the deposit,
in his books, and upon the two certificates of payment into
court. The money thus deposited is deemed the property
of the third person, subject to the plaintiffs interest therein,
and subject to the rights of a creditor of the defendant,
where the direction was given for the purpose of hindering,
delaying, or defrauding creditors. The money, or the residue
thereof, must be paid to the third person, where, by the
provisions of the last two sections, it is required to be
refunded to the defendant, or his representative.

§ 587. If, after the defendant is arrested, he escapes or is ,

rescued, or the bail, if any, given by him, do not justify,

when they are not accepted, the sheriff is liable as bail. A
But the sheriE may, except in an action to recover a chattel, i
discharge himself from liability, by the giving and justification of bail, as follows:
1. If the case is one where the order could be granted
only by the court, at any time before the court directs the

performance of the act speciiied in the order.
2. In any other case, at any time before an execution is

issued against the person of the defendant, upon a judgment
in the action.

§ 588. If judgment is recovered against the sheriff, upon

, his liability as bail, and an execution thereon is returned

Wholly or partly unsatisfied, the official bond of the sheriff
may be prosecuted, as in any other case of delinquency.

§ 589. The bail taken upon the arrest, unless they justify,
or other bail are given and justify, are liable to the sheriff
for all damages, which he sustains by reason thereof.

§ 590. If the defendant does not give bail, Within ten
days after he is arrested, the sheriff must file with the clerk
the order of arrest, with his return thereon indorsed, and
the papers upon which the order of arrest was granted,

§ 591. Exceptin an action to recover a chattel, the bail
may surrender the defendant in their own exoneration, or
the defendant may surrender himself in exoneration of the
bail, before the expiration of the time to answer, in an
action against them. The surrender must be made to the
sheriff of the county, Where the defendant Was arrested.

§ 592. Where the bail surrender the defendant, the surrender must be made in the following manner:
1. They must take the defendant to the sheriff, and
require him, in writing, to take the defendant into his

custody.

2. A certified copy of the undertaking of the bail must
be delivered to the sheriff, who must detain the defendant
in his custody thereupon, as upon the original mandate, and
must, by a certificate in writing, acknowledge the surrender.
Upon the application of the bail, made upon notice to the
plaintiff’s attorney, and upon production of the sheriff’s
certificate and a copy of the undertaking, a judge of the
court, or the county judge of the county where the action is
triable, may make an order, directing that the bail be exonerated. On filing the order and the papers used on the
application therefor, the bail are exonerated accordingly.

§ 593. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the
bail may themselves arrest him, or, by a written authority,
indorsed on a certified copy of the undertaking, may empower another person to do so. The arrest may be made,
within or without the State; and one or more of the bail
may thus arrest and surrender the defendant, although the
others do not join with him or them, for that purpose.

§ 594. Where the defendant surrenders himself in exoneration of his bail, he must present himself to the sheriff, and
require the sheriff, in writing, to take him into custody, in
exoneration of his bail. The sheriff must detain him accordingly, as prescribed in subdivision second of section 592 of
this act; and, when requested by the bail, at any time after
the surrender, the sheriff must, by a certificate in writing,
acknowledge the surrender. An order for the exoneration
of the bail may be procured, as prescribed in section 592 of
this act.

§ 595. Where the sheritf is liable as bail, he has all the
rights and privileges, and is subject to all the duties and
liabilities of bail; and bail given by him, in order to discharge himself from liability, must be regarded as the hail
of the defendant in the action. But this section does not
apply to an action to recover a chattel; or to a case where a
defence arises to an action against the bail, in consequence
of an act or omission of the sheriff.

§ 596. In case of failure to comply with the undertaking,

the bail may be proceeded against by action, and not otherW136.

§ 597. An action may be brought, as prescribed in the
last section, in a case Where the order of arrest could 
granted only by the court, at any time after the bail have
failed to comply With their undertaking. Where the
undertaking was given in an action to recover a chattel,
an action may be brought thereupon, at any time after the
return, Wholly or partly unsatisfied, of an execution for the
delivery of the possession of the chattel, With respect to
which the order of arrest was granted. In any other case,
an action cannot be brought, as prescribed in the last section,
until the following requisites have been complied With:

1. An execution, against the property of the defendant,
must have been issued to the sheriff of the county in which
he was arrested, and returned by that sheriff, Wholly or
partly unsatisfied.

2. An execution, against the person of the defendant,
must have been issued to the same sheriff,‘ and by him
returned, not less than fifteen days after its receipt, to the
effect that the defendant could not be found Within his
county.

§ 598. The sheriff must diligently endeavor to serve an
execution issued and delivered to him, as prescribed in the
last section, notwithstanding any direction he may receive
from the plaintiff, or his attorney.

§ 599. In an action against bail, it is a defence, that an
execution, against the property, or against the person, of the
defendant in the original action, was not issued, as prescribed in the last section but one; or that it was not issued
in sufficient time to enable the sheriff to serve it; or that a
direction was given, or other fraudulent or collusive means

were used, by the plaintiff or his attorney, to prevent the
service thereof.

§ 600. If the defendant in the original action, after his
' discharge upon bail, is imprisoned, either within or without
the State, upon a criminal charge, or a conviction of a criminal offence, the court, in which an action against the bail is t

pending, may, before the expiration of the time to answer,
and upon notice to the adverse party, make such an order
for the relief of the bail, as justice requires.


§ 601. Except in an action to recover a chattel, the bail

must be exonerated where either of the following events 

occurs, before the expiration of the time to answer in an
action against them:

1. The death of the original defendant.

2. His legal discharge from the obligation to render himself amenable to the process, direction, or proceedings, with
respect to which the undertaking of the bail was made.

3. His surrender to the sheriff of the county where he
was arrested.

Where either event occurs, after the commencement of the
action against the hail, the court may, in its discretion, impose
the payment of the plaintiffs costs and expenses, incurred
after the return of the execution against the person, as a condition of allowing the exoneration. And the court may, by
an order, made upon notice to the adverse party, grant such
further time as it deems just, after answer, for the surrender
of the original defendant. In that case, his surrender,
within the time so granted, has the same effect, as if it had
been made before answer. ’

§ 626. Where the injunction order was granted Without
notice, the party enjoined may apply, upon the papers upon
which it was granted, for an order vacating or modifying
the injunction order. Such an application may be made,
Without notice, to the judge who granted the order, or who
held the term of the court Where it was granted; or to
the general term of the court. It cannot be made Without
notice, to any other judge or term, unless the applicant produces proof, by affidavit, that, by reason of the absence or
other disability of the judge who granted the order, the
application cannot be made to him; and that the applicant
will be exposed to great injury, by the delay required for an
application upon notice. The affidavit must be filed with
the clerk: and a copy thereof, and of the order vacating or
modifying the injunction order, must be served upon the
plaintiff's attorney, before that order takes effect.

§ 627. Where the injunction order was granted upon
notice, the party enjoined may also apply, upon notice, to
the judge who granted it, or to the court, at a term where
a contested motion in the action may be heard, for an order,
vacating or modifying the injunction order. Such an
application may be founded upon the papers upon which
the injunction was granted; or upon proof, by afiidavit, on
the part of the defendant; or both. Where it is founded
upon proof on the part of the defendant, it may be opposed

‘by new proof, by afhdavit, on the part of the plaintiff, tending to sustain any ground for the injunction, recited in the
order, but no other.

§ 628. The granting or denial of an application, made as
prescribed in the last section, founded only upon the papers
upon which_ the injunction order was granted, does not projudice a subsequent application, seasonably made, founded
upon proof, by aflidavit, on the part of the defendant. And
the granting or denial of either application does not prejudice a subsequent application, seasonably made, founded
upon the failure of a complaint, which had not been made
at the time of the former application, to set forth a cause of
action suflicient to entitle the plaintiff to the injunction
order, upon one or more grounds, recited therein.

§ 629. Upon the hearing of an application, upon notice,

‘to vacate or modify an injunction order, the court or judge

may require a new undertaking, in the same or in a different sum, to be given by the plaintiff, with the like sureties,
and to the like effect, as upon granting an original order.
The persons executing the new undertaking become liable
thereon, as if they had executed it upon the granting of the
original order. The persons who executed the original undertaking remain liable thereon, until the new undertaking
is given and approved, and no longer.

§ 630. Upon the hearing of a contested application for
:an injunction order, or to vacate or modify such an order, a
verified answer has the effect only of an affidavit.

§ 631. In a case where the right to an injunction depends
upon the nature of the action, the court or judge, upon an
application specified in the last section, must, if necessary
for the purposes of the motion, determine, as a question of
fact, the truth of each allegation of the complaint, essential
to granting or sustaining the injunction order.

§ 632. In any other case, the court or judge, upon an
application specified in the last two sections, must assume
the truth of each allegation of the complaint, which is essential to sustain the injunction, and respecting which there is
coniiicting evidence; although a coniiict of evidence may be
taken into consideration, for the purpose of nxing the
amount of the security to be given by the plaintiff.

§ 633. Where the plaintiif’s right to an injunction
depends partly upon allegations extrinsic to the complaint,
the truth of those allegations must be determined, as a
question of fact, by the court or judge, upon an application
to vacate or modify an injunction order.

§ 634. The determination of a question of fact, arising as
specined in the last section, may be made upon the proof
adduced on both sides; or the hearing may be adjourned
for the purpose of enabling the parties to procure further
evidence, either by aiiidavit, or by deposition taken before

a referee, appointed for that purpose by the court or judge.

judge, upon the application therefor; but, for the purpose
of determining Whether the Warrant Was properly granted,

been made at the time of the application. In the same case,
personal service of the summons must be made. upon the
defendant, against Whose property the Warrant is granted,
within thirty days after the granting thereof; or else, before
the expiration of the same time, service of the summons by

order obtained therefor, as prescribed in this act; and, if
publication has been, or is thereafter commenced, the service
must be made complete, by the continuance thereof.

§ 639. The plaintiff procuring the warrant must, within
ten days after the granting thereof, cause the afiidavits,
upon which it was granted, to be filed in the office of the

§ 643. The judge, who granted the Warrant of attach--‘
ment, has exclusive control over, and direction of, thei

§ 645. The real property, which may be levied upon by
virtue of a Warrant of attachment, includes any interest in

avoiding payment thereof.

§ 647. The rights or shares which the defendant has in
the stock of an association or corporation, together with the
interest and profits thereon, may be levied upon; and the

of action arising upon contract; including a bond, promissory
note, or other instrument for the payment of money only,
in terms negotiable, or payable to the bearer or holder

by a foreign or domestic government, state, county, public
officer, association, municipal or other corporation, or by a
private person, either Within or Without the State; which

upon, and a seizure and attachment of, the debt represented
thereby.

made as follows:

1. Upon real property, by filing with the clerk of the
county, where it is situated, a notice of the attachment,

§ 651. If a person, to whom application is made, as pre,scribed in the last section, refuses to give such a certificate;
or if it is made to appear, by amdavit, to the satisfaction of
the court, or a judge thereof, or the county judge of the
county to which the warrant is issued, that there is reason
to suspect that a certificate given by him is untrue, or that
it fails fully to set forth the facts, required to be shown

thereby; the court or judge may make an order, directing
him to attend, at a specified time, and at a place within the
county of his residence, and submit to an examination under
oath, concerning the same. The order may, in the discretion
of the court or judge, direct an appearance before a referee
named therein.

§ 652. Except as otherwise prescribed in the next section,

of a defendant, against whom a warrant of attachment is
issued, have been shipped for transportation, without reshipment or transshipment in the State, to a port or place without the State, may transport and deliver them according to
their destination, notwithstanding the Warrant; unless the
plaintiff, his agent or attorney, executes a bond, to the owner
or the master of the vessel, conditioned to pay him all
expenses, damages, and charges, which may be incurred by
him, or to which he may be subjected, for unlading the
goods from the vessel, and for all necessary detention of the
vessel, for that purpose. The bond must be approved, with
respect to its form, the amount of the penalty, and the
sufficiency of the sureties, by a judge of the court, or the
county judge of the county wherein the vessel is situated, or,
in the city and county of N ew-York, by a judge of the
court of common pleas for that city and county.

§ 653. The last section does not apply, where the owner
or master, before the shipment of the goods, had actual
information of the granting of the warrant, or where he has,
in any wise, connived at, or been privy to, the shipment
thereof, for the purpose of screening them from legal process, or of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors.

§ 654. The sheriff must, immediately after levying under
a warrant of attachment, make, with the assistance of two
disinterested freeholders, a description of the real property,
and a just and true inventory of the personal property, upon

papers taken into his custody, stating therein the estimated
value of each parcel of real property attached, or of the
interest of the defendant therein, and of each article of personal property, enumerating such of the latter as are perishable. The inventory must be signed by the sheriff and the

been unable to obtain possession. And he may discontinue
such an action or special proceeding, at such time and on
such terms, as the court or judge directs.

without notice, as the urgency of the case, in his opinion,
requires, direct the sheriff to sell it at public auction; and
thereupon the sheriff must sell it accordingly. The order
directing the sale must prescribe the time, place, and notice
thereof, and how notice shall be given. The sheriff must
retain in his hands the proceeds of the sale, after deducting
his expenses, as allowed by the court or judge.

§ 657. If goods or effects, other than a vessel, attached
as the property of the defendant, are claimed by or in
behalf of another person, as his property, the sheriff may,
in his discretion, impanel a jury to try the validity of the
claim.

§ 658. If, by their inquisition, the jury find the property 3
of the goods or effects to be in the claimant, the sheriff must j

undertaking is given, the sheriff must detain the goods or
effects, as the property of the defendant.

claimant or his agent may execute an undertaking to the3

sheriff, with sufficient sureties, approved by the court or
judge, who must justify in twice the appraised value, to the

the claimant will establish that he was the owner of the vessel, share, or interest, at the time of the levy thereupon ; and
that, in case of his failure to do so, he will pay the amount of
the valuation, with interest from the date of the undertaking, to the sheriff ; or, if the warrant is vacated or annulled,
to the defendant, or his personal representative.

or a demand attached, or upon an undertaking given as
prescribed in this title, by a person other than the plaintiff.
The sheriff must receive the proceeds of such an action,
but he is not liable for the costs or expenses thereof. Costs

the warrant, but not against the sheriii

§ 678. The court or judge must grant leave to bring such

§ 682. The defendant, or a person who has acquired alien
upon, or interest in, his property, after it was attached, may,
at any time before the actual application of the attached
property, or the proceeds thereof, to the payment of a judgment recovered in the action, apply to vacate or modify the
warrant, or to increase the security, given by the plaintiff, or
for one or more of those forms of relief, together, or in the
alternative. If the application is for two or more of those
forms of relief, it must be regarded, for the purposes contemplated by the next four sections, as so many separate
motions.

§ 683. An application, specified in the last section, may
be founded only upon the papers upon which the warrant
was granted; in which case, it must be made to the court,
or, if the warrant was granted‘ by a judge out of court,
to the same judge, in court or out of court, and with or
without notice, as he deems proper. Or it may be founded
upon proof, by afiidavit, on the part of the defendant; in
which case, it must be made to the court, or, if the warrant
was granted by a judge out of court, to any judge of the
court, upon notice; and it may be opposed by new proof,
by afiidavit, on the part of the plaintiff, tending to sustain
any ground for the attachment, recited in the Warrant, and
no other, unless the defendant relies upon a discharge in
bankruptcy, _or upon a discharge or exoneration, granted in
insolvent proceedings; in which case, the plaintiff may show
any matter, in avoidance thereof, which he might show upon

the trial.

§ 684. Upon the hearing of such an application, the
court or judge must assume the truth of each allegation of
the complaint, respecting which there is conflicting evidence; «
although a conflict of evidence may be taken into consideration, for the purpose of fixing the amount of the security
to be given by the plaintidl

§ 685. The truth of every other allegation of fact, arising
upon the application, must be determined, as a question of
fact, by the court or judge. But the hearing may be
adjourned, to enable the parties to procure further evidence.
either by aflidavit, or by deposition taken before a referee,
appointed for that purpose, by the court or judge.

§ 686. The granting or denial of such an application,
founded only upon the papers upon which the warrant of
attachment was granted, does not prejudice a subsequent

application, seasonably made, founded upon proof, by affidavit, on the part of the defendant: and the granting or denial
of either application does not prejudice a subsequent application, seasonably made, founded upon the failure of a complaint, which had not been made at the time of the former
application, to set forth a cause of action, sutlicient to entitle
the plaintiff to the Warrant of attachment, upon any ground
recited therein.

§ 687. The defendant may, at any time after he has
appeared in the action, and before final judgment, apply to
the judge who granted the warrant, or to the court, for an
order to discharge the attachment, as to the whole or a part
of the property attached.

§ 688. Upon such an application, a sole defendant must
give an undertaking, with at least two sufficient sureties, to
the effect that the sureties Will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the amount of any judgment which may be recovered
in the action against the defendant, not exceeding a sum
specified in the undertaking, with interest. The sum so
specified must be at least equal to the amount of the plaintiff’s demand, as specified in his ailidavit; or, at the option
of the defendant, equal to the appraised value, according to
the inventory, of the property attached; or, if the application is to discharge the attachment, as to a part only of the
property attached, to the appraised value of that portion.

§ 689. Where there are two or more defendants, and an
application is made, as prescribed in the last two sections, by
one or more, but not by all of them, the undertaking must
provide for the payment of any judgment, which may be
recovered against any of the defendants in the action,

unless the applicant makes proof, by affidavit, to the satis-‘

faction of the court or judge, that the property, with respect
to which the application is made, belongs to him separately;
in which case, the undertaking must provide for the payment of any judgment which may be recovered in the action
against the applicant, either alone, or jointly with any other
defendant. Where an application is made, as prescribed in
this section, at least two days notice thereof, with a copy of
the aiiidavit, must be served upon the plaintiff’s attorney,
who may oppose the application by proof, by aiiidavit, that
one or more of the other defendants own, or have an interest

a notice of the filing, must be forthwith served upon the

plaintiff ’s attorney; who may, within three days thereafter,‘
give notice to the sheriff, that he excepts to the suiiiciency

of the sureties. Thereupon the sureties must justify, upon
the like notice, and in like manner, as bail upon an arrest;
or a new undertaking must be given, with new sureties,
who must justify in like manner. If the plaintiff does not

§ 691. The sheriE is responsible for the sufficiency of the
sureties; and he may retain possession of the property

attached, and the proceeds thereof, until the objection to,

them is waived, as prescribed in the last section, or they, or

§ 692. The last five sections are applicable, Where a vessel, or a share or interest therein, is attached. If it is necessary, to enable the defendant to discharge the attachment,

to the court, upon an affidavit showing the facts, for an
order to discharge the attachment, as to that interest.

§ 694. Upon such an application, the applicant must give
an undertaking, with at least two suiiicient sureties, to the
effect that the sureties will pay to the sheriff, on demand, the
amount of any judgment, which may be recovered against
the partner Who is defendant in the action; or which may
be recovered against him, in any other action, wherein the
other partners are not defendants, and wherein a Warrant of
attachment, or an execution, may come to the sheriif’s hands,

§ 697. Where two or more warrants of attachment, against
the same defendant, are delivered to the sheriff of the same
county, to be executed, their respective preferences, and the
rules, Where a levy, or a levy and sale, have been made
under a junior warrant, are the same, as where two or more

executions, against the property of the same defendant, are
delivered to the sheriif of the same county, to be executed.

§ 698. Where a domestic vessel, or a share or interest
therein, has been attached, and afterwards released, as prescribed in this title; or where the personal property of a
partnership, of which the defendant was a member, has been
attached, and the attachment afterwards discharged, upon
the application of another partner, as prescribed in this title;
another warrant, against the same defendant, shall not be
levied on the same property, by the sheriff of the same or of
any other county, until after the first warrant has been
vacated or annulled. But, except as thus prescribed, where a
second warrant, against the same defendant, is delivered to
the same sheriff, he must execute it, by a levy upon property
within his county, and he must thereupon take the same
proceedings, as if the levy was made under the first warrant.

§ 699. If, after a Warrant of attachment, granted by a
judge out of court, has been placed in the hands of the
sheriff for execution, and before it has been vacated or
annulled, another warrant of attachment against the same
defendant, granted by the court, or by another judge, is
placed in the hands of the sheriff of the same county, the
judge granting the first warrant controls the subsequent warrant, and the proceedings thereunder, subject to the provisions of section 643 of this act; and, for that purpose, he is
deemed to be the judge granting the same, within the meaning of this title. And Where Warrants have been granted

in different actions, a motion, or other proceeding, relating
to the execution of either of them, which may be made or

taken, by or before the court, as prescribed in this title,
must be made or taken in the action, in which the first warrant was granted, except as prescribed in the next section.

§ 700. The last section does not apply to an application
to vacate or modify either of the warrants of attachment,
which must be made, as if no other warrant of attachment
had been granted. After the first warrant is vacated or
annulled, the provisions of the last section apply to the
warrant next in order, and to the judge who granted the

881119.

§ 701. Where a foreign vessel, or a share or interest therein,
has been attached and valued, as prescribed in article second
of this title, and the plaintiff, in the first Warrant of attachment, fails to give an undertaking to prevent the release
thereof, the court or judge may grant to the plaintiff in a
second warrant, then in the sheriff ’s hands for execution, an
extension, of not more than three days thereafter, Within
Which to furnish an undertaking, in all respects like the one
to be furnished by the first plaintiff. And if he furnishes
it, Within that time, he has the same rights and privileges,
and is subject to the same duties and liabilities, with
respect to the vessel and its proceeds, and the subsequent
proceedings relating thereto, as if his was the first warrant.

§ 702. If a foreign vessel, or a share or interest therein,
has been attached, and afterwards released, by reason of the A
failure of the plaintiff, in the first or the second warrant,
to give an undertaking to prevent the release, it shall not
be again attached, under awarrant against the same defendant, which had been delivered to the sheriff of the same
county, before the expiration of the time Within which the
undertaking should have been furnished. But it may be
again attached, under a subsequent warrant against the same
defendant; in which case, the plaintiff therein, and the plaintiff in each Warrant subsequently delivered to the sheriff,
have the same rights, and privileges, and are subject to the
same duties and liabilities, with respect to the vessel and its
proceeds, and the subsequent proceedings relating thereto,

as if the Warrant, under which it was attended, was the first
Warrant.

§ 703. Where the plaintiff in a Warrant of attachment
has commenced an action, in the name of himself and the
sheriff jointly, as prescribed in this title, a plaintiff in a
junior warrant may apply to the court or judge, to direct as
to the conduct, discontinuance, or settlement of the same, or
to impose terms, conditions, and regulations as to the continuance thereof, in the interest of the applicant; and such
order may be made thereupon, as justice requires. If the
first Warrant is vacated, or the attachment thereunder is
released or discharged, Without affecting the cause of action
prosecuted by the plaintiff therein and the sheriff jointly,
the plaintiff in the Warrant next in order, may, upon his
own application, be substituted as joint plaintiff with the
sheriff, by an order, made as upon an application for leave
to bring such an action. ’

§ 704. A plaintiff in a second Warrant may apply to
the court or judge, upon notice to the plaintiff in the first
warrant, and to the sheriff, for leave to bring and maintain,
in the name of himself and the sheriff jointly, any action,
which might be brought in the name of the senior plaintiff

and the sheriff. If it appears that the plaintiff in the first
warrant neglects or refuses to be joined with the sheriff in
such an action, or to comply with the terms, conditions, and
regulations, imposed, either upon granting him an order for
that purpose, or upon the hearing of an application, made
as prescribed in this section, the court or judge may grant
to the plaintiff in the second warrant, leave to bring and
maintain such an action, in the name of himself and the
sheriff jointly, with like effect, as if his was the first warrant. ‘

§ 705. Where there are more than two warrants of
attachment, against the same defendant, the plaintiffs in
the third and each subsequent warrant have, according to
their respective priorities, the same rights and privileges, as
against the plaintiffs in all senior warrants, which the plaintiff in the second Warrant has, as against the plaintiff in
the first, and are subject to the same duties and liabilities;
except that a second extension of the time, within which to
furnish an undertaking to prevent the release of a foreign
vessel, or a share or interest therein, shall not be granted.
And the plaintiffs in two or more junior warrants of attachment, may, by agreement among themselves, take jointly,
and for their common benefit, any proceeding, permitted by
this title to be taken, by the plaintiff in a second or subsequent warrant of attachment; provided that it does not
interfere with the preferential or other right of an intermediate plaintiff.

§ 706. Where a levy, under a Warrant of attachment in an
action, has been made, an execution against property, upon
a final judgment in favor of the plaintilf therein, recovered
after the expiration of the term of oilice of the sheriff, who
made the levy, must nevertheless be directed to and executed by that sheriff, unless another person is designated
by law to complete the unfinished business pertaining to his
office; or, in that case, to the person so designated.

§ 707. Where the summons was served upon the defendant, Without the State, otherwise than personally, pursuant
to an order obtained for that purp'ose, as prescribed in chapter fifth of this act, and he has not appeared in the
action, the judgment can be enforced only against the property which has been levied upon, under the Warrant of
attachment, at the time when it is entered. But this section does not declare the effect of such a judgment, with
respect to the application of any statute of limitation.

§ 708. Where an. execution against property is issued
upon a judgment for the plaintiff, in an action in which a
warrant of attachment has been levied, the sheriff must
satisfy it, as follows:

1. He must pay over to the plaintiff the money attached
by him, or in his hands, as the proceeds of the sale of perishable property, or of a vessel, or a share or interest therein,
sold by him, or of debts or other things in action collected
by him; or so much thereof as is necessary to satisfy the
judgment.

2. If it is insuilicient to satisfy the judgment, he must
sell, under the execution, the other personal property attached, or so much thereof as is necessary; including rights
or shares in the stock of an association or corporation, or a
bond or other instrument for the payment of money, executed
and issued, with interest coupons annexed, by a government,
state, county, public officer, or municipal or other corporation. Which is in terms negotiable, or payable to the bearer
or holder, the principal whereof is not then payable; but

not including any other debt or thing in action. If the

proceeds of that property are in sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and -the execution requires him to satisfy it out of
any other personal property of the defendant, he must sell
the personal property, upon which he has levied by virtue
of the execution. If the proceeds of the personal property,
applicable to the execution, are insuflicient to satisfy the
judgment, the sheriff must sell, under the execution, all the
right, title, and interest, which the defendant had in the
real property attached, at the time when the notice was
filed, or at any time afterwards, before resorting to any
other real property. '

3. If personal property attached, belonging to the defendant, has passed out of the hands of the sheriff, without
having been sold or converted into money, and the attach.
ment has not been discharged, as to that property, he must,
if practicable, regain possession thereof; and, for that purpose, he has all the authority which he had, to seize the
same under the warrant. A person, who wilfully conceals
or withholds such property from him, is liable to double
damages, at the suit of the party aggrieved.

4. Until the judgment is paid, he may collect the debts
and other things in action attached, and prosecute a bond or
undertaking, which he has taken in the course of the proceedings, and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of
the judgment.

5. Where six months have expired, since the rendering of
the judgment, the court, upon the petition of the plaintiff,
accompanied with an aliidavit, specifying fully all the proceedings of the sheriff, since the levy under the warrant, the.
property attached, and the disposition thereof; and the aifi-u
davit of the sheriff, showing that he has used diligence, in
endeavoring to collect the debts and other things in action
attached, and that a portion thereof remains uncollected;
may direct the sheriff to sell the remaining portion, upon
such terms, and in such manner, as it thinks proper. Notice
of the application must be given to the defendant’s attorney,
if the defendant appeared in the action. If the summons
was not personally served on the defendant. and he did not

appear, the court may direct service of notice, as it thinks
proper; or may grant the application without notice.

§ 709. Where a warrant of attachment is vacated, or annulled, or an attachment is discharged, upon the application
of the defendant, the sheriff must, except in a case where it
is otherwise specially prescribed by law, deliver over to the
defendant, or to the person entitled thereto, as the defendant’s representative, upon reasonable demand, and upon
payment of all costs, charges, and expenses, legally chargeable by the sheriff, all the attached personal property
remaining in his hands, or that portion thereof, as to which
the attachment is discharged, or the proceeds thereof, if it

has been sold by him.

§ 710. Where the sheri&' is required, by this title, to
deliver attached property, or the proceeds thereof, to the
defendant, he must also deliver to him, unless otherwise
specially directed by the court or judge, all books of
account, vouchers, evidences of debt, muniments of title,
or other papers, relating to the property, either real or
personal, or to its proceeds; together with all bonds or
undertakings, relating thereto, which he has taken in the
course of the proceedings, and which have not been fully
satisfied ; except undertakings, given by the defendant, upon
the discharge of property. He must also deliver a written
assignment, duly acknowledged, of each bond or undertaking, and of each other instrument, to which the defendant is
thus entitled, an assignment of which is necessary to perfect
or protect the defendant’s title thereto. -The defendant
must also, but upon '_his own application only, be substituted in place of the sheriff, or the sheriff and the plaintiff
jointly, in an action brought as prescribed in this title ; but
the court or judge may impose, as a condition of granting
the order of substitution, such terms as justice requires,
with respect to indemnity and payment of expenses. The
defendant’s rights, with respect to property attached and
not disposed of, and a bond, undertaking, or other instrument, to which he is thus entitled, are the same as those of
the sheriif, while the Warrant was still in force, except where
his rights are specially defined or regulated by law.

§ 711. At any time after the warrant of attachment has
been vacated or annulled, or the attachment has been discharged as to real property attached, the court may, in its
discretion, upon the application of any person aggrieved,
and upon such notice as it deems just, direct, that a notice,
filed for the purpose of attaching the property, be cancelled
of record, by the clerk of the county where it is filed and
recorded. The cancellation must be made by a note, to that
effect, on the margin of the record, referring to the order;

and, unless the order is entered in the same clerk’s office, a

certified copy thereof must, at the same time, be filed therein.

§ 712. Where a warrant of attachment has been vacated
or annulled, the sheriff must forthwith file, in the clerk’s
ofiice, the warrant, with a return of his proceedings thereon.
Upon the application of either party, and proof of the
sheriff’s neglect, the court may direct him so to do, forthwith, or within a specified time. 1

pleadings, a memorandum thereof° must be annexed to the
j udgment-roll. The plaintiff’s right to recover costs, and his
liability to pay ‘costs to the defendant, are determined by
the amount of the residue. —

§ 735. The attorney for a party may, at any time before
rthe trial, exhibit to the attorney for the adverse party, a
paper, material to the action, and request a written admission of its genuineness. If the admission is not given,
Within four days after the request, and the paper is proved
or admitted on the trial, the expenses, incurred by the party
exhibiting it, in order to prove its genuineness, must be
ascertained at the trial, and paid by the party refusing the
admission ; unless it appears, to the satisfaction of the court,
that there was a good reason for the refusal.

§ 736. In an action to recover damages for breach of a
contract, the defendant’s attorney may, with the answer,
serve upon the plaintiff’s attorney, a Written offer, that, if

the defendant fails in his defence, the damages may be
assessed at a specified sum. If the plaintiff serves notice,
that he accepts the offer, with or before the notice of trial,
and damages are awarded to him on the trial, they must be
assessed accordingly.

§ 737. If the plaintiff does not accept the offer, he cannot
prove it, upon the trial. But if the damages, awarded to
him, do not exceed the sum offered, the defendant is entitled
to recover the expenses, necessarily incurred by him in preparing for the trial, with respect to the question of damages.
The expenses must be ascertained, by the judge, or the
referee, by or before whom the cause is tried.

§ 738. The defendant may, before the trial, serve upon
the plaintiff’s attorney, a written offer, to allow judgment
to be taken against him, for a sum, or property, or to’ the
effect, therein specified, with costs. If there are two or
more defendants, and the action can be severed, a like offer
may be made by one or more defendants, against whom a
separate judgment may be taken. If the plaintiff, within
ten days thereafter, serves upon the defendant’s attorney,
notice that he accepts the offer, he may file the summons,
complaint, and offer, with proof of acceptance, and thereupon the clerk must enter judgment accordingly. If notice
of acceptance is not thus given, the offer cannot be given in
evidence upon the trial ; but, if the plaintiff fails to obtain
a more favorable judgment, he cannot recover costs from
the time of the offer, but must pay costs from that time.

§ 739. Where the defendant sets up a counterclaim, to an
amount greater than the plaintiff's claim, or sufficient to
reduce the plaintiff’s recovery below fifty dollars, the plaintiff may serve, upon the defendant’s attorney, a written offer,
to allow judgment to be taken against him, for a specified
sum, with costs, or against the defendant for a specified sum,
and against the plaintiff for costs. If the defendant, within

ten days thereafter, serves, upon the plaintiff’s attorney,
notice that he accepts the offer, either party may file the
summons, complaint, answer, and offer, or copies thereof,
and proof of acceptance; and thereupon the clerk must
enter judgment accordingly. If notice of acceptance is not
thus given, the offer cannot be given in evidence, upon the
trial; but, if the defendant fails to recover a more favorable judgment, he cannot recover costs from the time of the
offer, but must pay costs from that time.

§ 740. Unless an offer or an acceptance, made as prescribed in either of the last four sections, is subscribed by
the party making it, his attorney must subscribe it, and
annex thereto his afiidavit, to the effect, that he is duly
authorized to make it, in behalf of the party.

§ 741. If the adverse party moves the trial, before the
expiration of ten days, after an oifer is made, he is deemed

to have rejected the offer. The party making the offer cannot move the trial until the expiration of the ten days.

§ 742. Where it appears, to the satisfaction of the court,
in a case where judgment has been taken, upon the acceptance of an offer, as prescribed in this title, that the action
was commenced, upon an express or tacit, direct or indirect,
agreement or understanding between the parties, that an
offer should be made by one party, for the purpose of enabling the other party to take judgment thereupon; the
judgment must be set aside, within one year after it is entered, upon the application of a subsequent judgment
creditor of the party, against whom the judgment was
taken; or of a third person interested in property, affected
by the judgment; or, where the judgment was taken against
two or more persons as joint debtors, upon the application
of either of them, who did not join in, or consent to the
offer. But where a judgment is so set aside, the title to
property, sold to a purchaser, for value, and in good faith,

shall not be affected thereby.

verdict, report, or decision, or the interlocutory judgment,
is set aside.

recover damages for a personal injury, the action does not

decision is finally set aside. Until it is finally set aside,

former application is stated, and the proceedings thereupon,
and subsequent thereto, are fully set forth, in the papers
upon which the application is made.

§ 778. A person making an application, forbidden by the
last two sections, with knowledge of the previous application, shall be punished by the court, for a contempt.

§ 779. Where costs of a motion, directed by an order to
be paid, are not paid, within the time fixed for that purpose

nearly as may be, as an execution upon a judgment; omitting the recitals and directions, relating to real property.

abide the event of the action, or where costs of a motion,
awarded by an order, have not been collected, when final
judgment is entered, they may be taxed as part of the costs

not so subpoenaed or ordered by his own procurement, With
the intent of avoiding arrest. He must also either annex to

that it has been lost or destroyed, and specify before What
court, and at What term, or before what oflicer, and at What

of the original, instead of a transcript, is necessary.

§ 867. A person shall not be compelled, by a subpoena
duces tecum to produce a book of account, belonging to

him, or under his control. In an action, an order, requiring
the production of such a book, may be made by the court,
or a. judge thereof‘, or a county judge, or by a referee
appointed by the court. In a special proceeding, instituted
out of court, a like order may be made by the oflicer, before
Whom it is pending. The court, judge, referee, or other
officer, may, in its or his discretion, make such an order
Without notice, or require notice of the application for the
order, as it or he thinks proper, to be given to the person

having the control of the book. A justice of the peace,

or other judge of a co1n't not of record, may make such an

order, in an action brought in his court, at any time after
the commencement thereof.

§ 868. The production, upon a trial, of a book or paper,
belonging to or under the control of a corporation, may
be compelled, in like manner as if it Was in the hands,

directed to the president, or other head of the corporation,

or to the officer thereof, in Whose custody the book or
paper is.

§ 869. In a case specified in the last section, or where a
subpoena duces tecum, or an order, made as prescribed in section 866 or section 867 of this act, requires a public
ofiicer to attend, and bring a book or paper under his control, the subpoena or order is deemed to be sufficiently
obeyed, if the book or paper is produced by a subordinate
oflicer or employee of the corporation, or in the public oflice,
Who possesses the requisite knowledge to identify it, and to
testify respecting the purposes for which it is used. If the
personal attendance of a particular oflicer of the corporation

was not in all respects fair, and -conducted as prescribed in
this title; or, except where the order is for the examination
of a party at the instance of an adverse party, that the

upon a trial; and the judge ‘or referee may take his deposition, as if an order had been made by the court, directing

' it to be so taken.

§ 880. The judge or referee taking a deposition, as prescribed in this article, must insert therein every answer or
declaration of the person examined, which either party
requires to be inserted. The deposition, when completed;

taken at the instance of an adverse party, or a deposition

’ taken in pursuance of a stipulation, as prescribed in this

article, shall not be so read in evidence, until it has been
satisfactorily proved, that the witness is dead, or is unable
personally to attend, by reason of his insanity, sickness, or
other infirmity; or that he has been and is absent from the

State, so that his attendance could not, with reasonable
diligence, be compelled by subpoena.

§ 883. A deposition, so read in evidence, has the same
effect, and no other, as the oral testimony of the witness
Would have; and an objection to the competency or credibility of the witness; or to the relevancy or substantial
competency of a question put to him, or of an answer
given by him; may be made, as if the Witness was then
personally examined, and without being noted upon the
deposition.

§ 884. The original affidavits, filed with such a deposition, or certified copies thereof, are presumptive evidence
of the facts therein contained, to show a compliance with
the provisions of this article.

§ 885. Where a party intends to make or oppose a

: motion in a court of record, and it is necessary for him to

have the testimony of a person, not a party, to use upon

order in the cause, may, in its or his discretion, make an
order, appointing a referee to take the deposition of that
person. The order must be founded upon proof, by ailidavit, that the applicant intends to make the motion, or
that notice of a motion has been given, which the applicant
intends to oppose. The aiiidavit must specify the nature
of the motion, and must show that the testimony is necessary thereupon. The order may be made upon or without
notice; and it may, in the discretion of the court or judge,

require the adverse party to be notified to attend, and to
have the right of cross-examination, as justice requires.

The person to be examined may be subpoenaed, and com-_

pelled to attend, as upon the trial. The deposition, when
taken, must be delivered to the attorney for the party Who
procured the order, unless the order provides for a diiferent disposition thereof.

within the State, is material to the applicant; a commission
may be issued, to one or more competent persons, named
therein; authorizing them, or any one of them, to examine
the witness or witnesses named therein, under oath, upon
the interrogatories annexed to the commission; to take and
certify the deposition of each witness; and to return the
same, and the commission, according to the directions given
in or with the commission.

§ 888. Such a commission may be issued, in either of the
following cases:

1. Where a party to an action, brought in a court of
record, is in default for Want of an appearance or pleading,
and the testimony is required upon the assessment of damages, by writ of inquiry, or upon a reference; or otherwise,
to enable the court to render the proper final judgment.

2. VVhere final judgment has been rendered against the

in the prosecution or defence of the action, if a new trial
is granted.

4. Where the application is made before the joinder of
issue, in an action brought in either of the courts, specified
in the last subdivision; and there is reason to apprehend,
that before issue is joined, and an application for a commission can thereafter be made, the witness will die, or
become unable to give his testimony, or remove, so that his
testimony cannot be taken.

5. Where an issue of fact has been joined, in an action
pending in a court of record, and the testimony is material to the applicant, in the prosecution or defence thereof.

§ 889. In a case specified in subdivision third of the last section, if the appeal has been taken to another court,
the application must be made to the court in which the
judgment was rendered; and an order, directing the commission to be issued, may be granted or refused, in the
discretion of that court. In a case specified in either of the
other subdivisions of that section, the application may be
made to the court, or a judge thereof, or, in the supreme
court, to the county judge of the county, where the ‘action
is triable; and it must be granted, upon satisfactory proof
of the facts authorizing it, unless the court or judge has
reason to believe, that the application is not made in good
faith, or unless an order for an open commission, or for taking depositions, is made as prescribed in this article. Notice
of the application must be given to the adverse party,
unless he is in default for Want of an appearance. Upon
granting the order, the court or judge may, in any case, impose such terms as justice requires.

§ 890. Where the order is made by a judge, out of court,
it must be entered in the office of the clerk. It shall be
granted, only in a case, Where the court would grant it, and

upon the same terms: and it is subject to the control of the
court.

§ 891. Unless the interrogatories, to be annexed to the
commission, are settled by consent of the parties, they must
be settled, upon notice, by a judge of the court, or, in the
supreme court, by the county judge of the county, where
the action is triable, as prescribed in the general rules of
practice.

§ 892. The interrogatories, when settled, must be annexed
to the commission. Either party must be allowed to insert

therein any question, pertinent to the issue, Which he proposes. Unless the parties stipulate in Writing, or the order
granting the commission prescribes, how it shall be returned,
the judge must indorse, upon the commission, the proper
direction for that purpose. Unless the court or judge

§ 963. The issues, treated of in this chapter, are those
only Which are presented by the pleadings. They arise
where a fact, or a conclusion of law, is maintained by one
party, and controverted by the other. They are of two
kinds: .

1. Of law; and

2. Of fact.

§ 964. An issue of law arises only upon a demurrer. An
issue of fact arises, in either of the following cases:

1. Upon a denial, contained in the answer, of a material
allegation of the complaint; or upon an allegation, contained in the answer, that the defendant has not sufficient
knowledge or information to form a belief, with respect to
a material allegation of the complaint.

2. Upon a similar denial or allegation, contained in the
reply, with respect to a material allegation of the answer.

3. Upon a material allegation of new matter, contained
in the answer, not requiring a reply; unless an issue of law
is joined thereupon.

" 4. Upon a material allegation of new matter, contained
in the reply; unless an issue of law is joined thereupon.

§ 965. An issue, either of law or of fact, must be judicially examined by means of a trial, as prescribed in this chapter; unless it is disposed of upon a motion, or upon
exceptions, as prescribed in chapter sixth of this act.

§ 966. Where an- issue of law and an issue of fact arise
in one action, the issue ‘ of law must be first disposed of,
except as otherwise prescribed in the next section. Where
there are two or ‘more defendants, pleading separately, an
issue of law, arising upon a pleading of one or more, and
not of all the defendants, may be tried separately, at the
option of either party; but where all the issues of fact are
triable in the same manner, they must be tried at the same
time, except as otherwise prescribed in this article.

§ 967. A separate trial, between the plaintiff and one
or more defendants, of some or all of the issues of fact,
or one trial of some or all of the issues of law, or a change
in the order of disposition of the issues, prescribed in the
last section, may be directed by the court, whenever,
in its opinion, justice will be promoted thereby. Such a
direction may be given, in an. order, made upon notice;
or, except where an application for such an order has been
denied, it may be_ given, by the judge holding the term,
where those issues are regularly upon the calendar for
trial, either with or without the entry of an order.

§ 968. In each of the following actions, an issue of fact
must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or a
reference is directed:

1. An action to recover a sum of money only.

2. An action of ejectment; for dower; for waste; for a nuisance ; or to recover a chattel.

§ 969., An issue of law, in any action, and an issue of fact,
in an action not specified in the last section, or wherein
provision for a trial by a  is not expressly made by law,
must be tried by the court, unless a reference or a jury
trial is directed.

§ 970. Where a party is entitled, by the constitution, or j
by express provision of law, to a trial, by a jury, of one or;

more issues of fact, in an action not specified in section
968 of this act, he may apply to the court for an order,
directing all the questions, arising upon those issues, to be
distinctly and plainly stated for trial accordingly. Notice
of the application must be served, within twenty days after
joinder of issue. The party omitting to serve the notice
within that time, is deemed to have waived his right to a
trial by a jury, unless notice of such an application has been
seasonably served by the adverse party ; in which case, if
the party serving the notice fails to make the application,
at the term for which it is noticed, the adverse party may
serve a like notice, on his part, within twenty days after
the adjournment of the term. Upon the hearing of the
application, the court must cause the issues, to the trial of
which, by a jury, the party is entitled, to be distinctly and
plainly stated. The subsequent proceedings are the same,
as where questions, arising upon the issues, are stated for
trial by a jury, in a case where neither pa.rty can, as of right,
require such a trial; except that the finding of the jury,
upon each question so stated, is conclusive in the action,
unless the verdict is set aside, or a new trial is granted.

§ 971. In an action, not specified in section 968 of this
act, where a party is not entitled, as of right, to a trial by
a jury, or where a party has omitted to apply for a trial by
a jury, as prescribed in the last section, the court may, in
its discretion, upon the application of either party, direct
that one or more questions of fact, arising upon the issues,
be tried by a jury, and may cause those questions to be distinctly and plainly stated for trial accordingly.

§ 972. If the questions, directed to be tried by a jury, as
prescribed in the last two sections, do not embrace all the
issues of fact in the action, the remaining issues of fact
must be tried by the court, or by a referee, separately from
the trial by the jury, and either before or after the trial
by the jury, as the court directs.

§ 973. Where the complaint demands two kinds of judgment, in the alternative, as prescribed in chapter sixth of
this act, the plaintiff’s attorney may, vsgithin ten days after
the joinder of issue, serve upon the defendant’.s attorney, a
notice, that the plaintiff abandons the demand for one kind
of judgment, specifying it distinctly. In that case, the
subsequent proceedings in the action must be the same, as
if the demand for that kind of judgment had not been contained in the complaint. If the plaintiff’s attorney does not
serve such a notice, the court, upon the application of either
party, must direct the trial, by a jury, of specific questions of
fact, arising upon the issues. In settling them, the court must
provide for the trial, by the jury, of all the issues, the determination of which fixes the character of the judgment, to
which the plaintiff is entitled ; and, also, in a proper case,
for determining, by the verdict, the amount or extent
of the recovery, contingently or absolutely, as the case
requires.

§ 974. Where the defendant interposes a counterclaim,
and thereupon demands an aihrmative judgment against
the plaintiff, the mode of trial of an issue of fact, arising
thereupon, is the sa' :1e, as if it arose in an action, brought
by the defendant, against the plaintiff, for the cause of
action stated in the counterclaim, and demanding the same
judgment; and each provision of the last four sections
applies to such an issue of fact, and to the trial thereof;
except that, if the court directs one or more specific questions of fact, involved in that issue, to be tried by a jury,
it may, in a proper case, direct that the trial thereof, and
of the issue of fact, arising upon the complaint, take place
at the same time.

§ 975. An issue, the disposition of which is not necessary to enable the court to render the appropriate judgment, is not required to be tried.

§ 976. An issue of law, or an issue of fact, triable by a
‘jury or by the court, must be tried at a term held by one
judge only, except as otherwise prescribed in section 297
of this act. In the supreme court, an issue of fact, triable
by a jury, must be tried in the circuit court; and an issue of
fact, triable by the court, or an issue of law, may be tried
in the circuit court, or at a special term of the supreme
court, as prescribed in the general rules of practice.

§ 977. At any time after the joinder of issue, and at least
fourteen days before the commencement of the term, either
party may serve a notice of trial. The party serving the
notice must file with the clerk a note of issue, stating the title of the action; the names of the attorneys; the time
when the last pleading was served; the nature of the issue,
whether of fact or of law; and, if an issue of fact, whether
it is triable by a jury, or by the court, without a jury. The
note of issue must be filed, at least eight days before the
commencement of the term; unless'a different time is prescribed in the general rules of practice. The clerk must
thereupon enter the cause upon the calendar, according to
the date of the issue. In the city and county of N ew-York,
where a party has served a noticeof trial, and filed a note of
issue, for a term, at which the cause is not tried, it is not
necessary for him to serve a new notice of trial, or file a
new note of’ issue for a succeeding term; and the action
must remain on the calendar until it is disposed of.

§ 978. The issues on the calendar must be arranged by
the clerk, in the following order:

1. Issues of fact, to be tried by a 

2. Issues of fact, to be tried by the court.

3. Issues of law.

Where a jury is in attendance, the issues must be disposed
of in the same order; unless, for the convenience of parties,
or the dispatch of business, the judge holding the term
otherwise directs.

§ 979. Where a jury is not in attendance, issues of law
have a preference over issues of fact; unless the judge holding the term otherwise directs.

§ 980. Either party, who has served the notice, may bring
the issue to trial; and, in the absence of the adverse party,
unless the judge holding the term, for good cause, otherwise
directs, may proceed with the cause, and take a dismissal
of the complaint, or a verdict, decision, or judgment, as the
case requires.

§ 981. Where the issue is brought to trial by the plaintiff, he must furnish the court with copies of the summons
and pleadings, and of the offer, if any has been made.
Where the issue is brought to trial by the defendant, and

the plaintiff does not furnish those papers, they must be
furnished by the defendant.

be tried in the county, where the cause of action, or some

part thereof, arose:

1, To recover a penalty or forfeiture, imposed by static,
in a case not specified in the next subdivision of this s -‘
tion; except that, where the offence, for which it is imposed,

situated in two or more counties, the action may be tried
in any county, bordering on the lake, river, or stream, and

county, which the plaintiff designates, for that purpose, in
the title of the complaint.

§ 985. If the county, designated in the complaint, as the
place of trial, is not the proper county, the action may notwithstanding be tried therein; unless the place of trial is
changed to the proper county, upon the demand of the
defendant, followed by the consent of the plaintiff, or the
order of the court.

§ 986. Where the defendant demands that the action be
tried in the proper county, his attorney must serve upon
the plaintiif’s attorney, with the answer, or before service
of the answer, a Written demand accordingly. The demand
must specify the county, where the defendant requires the
action to be tried. If the plaintiff’s attorney does not
serve his written consent to the change, as proposed by the
defendant, within five days after service of the demand,
the defendant’s attorney may, within ten days thereafter,
serve notice of a motion to change the place of trial.

§ 987. The court may, by order, change the place of
trial, in either of the following cases: '

1. Where the county, designated for that purpose in the

2. Where there is reason to believe, that an impartial
trial cannot be had in the proper county.

3. Where the convenience of witnesses, and the ends of
justice, will be promoted by the change.

county, the effect of the change, with respect to the subsequent proceedings, is the same, as if that county had been

service, upon the attorney for the exceptant, of a copy of
the decision of the court, or report of the referee, and a
Written notice of the entry of judgment thereupon. If the
notice of exception is filed before the entry of final judgment, it must be inserted in the judgment-roll; if afterwards, it must be annexed to the judgment-roll. In either
case, it constitutes a part of the papers, upon which an
appeal from the judgment must be heard.

§ 995. In any other case, an exception must be taken,
at the time when the ruling is made, unless it is taken to
the charge given to the jury; in which case, it must be
taken before the jury have rendered their verdict. It
must, at the time when it is taken, be reduced to 
by the exceptant, or entered in the minutes.

§ 996. A ruling, to which an exception is taken, as prescribed in the last four sections, can be reviewed only upon

an appeal from the judgment, rendered after the trial;

except in a case, where it is expressly prescribed by law,
that a motion for a new trial may be made thereupon.

§ 997. Where a party intends to appeal from a judgment,
rendered after the trial of an issue of fact, or to move for a
new trial of such an issue, he must, except as otherwise
prescribed by law, make a case, and procure the same to be
settled and signed, by the judge or the referee, by or before
whom the action was tried, as prescribed in the general
rules of practice; or, in case of the death or disability of
the judge or referee, in such manner as the court directs.
The case must contain so much of the evidence, and other
proceedings upon the trial, as is material to the questions
to be raised thereby, and also the exceptions taken by the
party making the case. If it afterwards becomes necessary to separate the exceptions, the separation may be
made, and the exceptions may be stated, with so much of
the evidence and other proceedings, as is material to the
questions raised by them, in a case, prepared and settled,
as directed in the general rules of practice; or, in the
absence of‘ directions therein, by the court, upon motion.
It is not necessary to state, in a case, that a finding upon
the facts, or a ruling upon the law, was made, which appears
in a referee’s report, or in the decision of the court, upon a
trial by the court, without a jury.

§ 998. It is not necessary to make a case, for the purpose of moving for a new trial, upon the minutes of the
judge, who presided at a trial by a jury; or upon an allegation of irregularity, or surprise; or where a party intends
to appeal from a judgment entered upon a referee’s report,
or a decision of the court upon a trial, without a jury, and
to rely only upon exceptions, taken as prescribed in section 994 of this act.

§ 999. The judge, presiding at a trial by a jury, may, in his

discretion, entertain a motion, made upon his minutes, at

the same term, to set aside the verdict and grant a new
trial, upon exceptions; or because the verdict is for excessive
or insufficient damages; or otherwise contrary to the evidence, or contrary to law. If an appeal is taken from the
order, made upon the motion, it must be heard, upon a case,
prepared and settled in the usual manner.

§ 1000. Upon the application of a party who has taken
one or more exceptions, the judge, presiding at a trial by
a jury, may, in his discretion, at any time during the same
term, direct an order to be entered, that the exceptions so
taken be heard, in the first instance, at the general term ; and
that judgment upon the verdict be suspended, in the mean
time. At any time before the hearing of the exceptions,
the order may be revoked or modified, in court or out of
court, by the judge who made it; or it may be set aside for
irregularity, by the court, at any term thereof. Unless it is
so revoked or set aside, the exceptions must be heard upon
a motion for a new trial, which must be decided by the
general term. The motion is deemed to have been made,
when the order was granted; and either party may notice
it for hearing at the general term, upon the exceptions.

§ 1001. Where the decision or report, rendered upon the
trial of an issue of fact by the court, Without a jury, or by
a referee, directs an interlocutory judgment to be entered;
and further proceedings must be taken, before the court or
a judge thereof, or a referee, before a final judgment can be
entered ; a motion for a new trial, upon one or more exceptions, may be made at the general term, after the entry of
the interlocutory judgment, and before the commencement
of the hearing directed therein. The time Within which
the party must except, for that purpose, to a ruling of law,
made, upon such a trial, by the judge or the referee, after ‘
the close of the testimony, is ten days after service of a
copy of the decision or report, and notice of the entry of
the interlocutory judgment thereupon.

§ 1002. In a case, not specified in the last three sections,
a motion for a new trial must, in the first instance, be
heard and decided at the special term. But where it is
founded upon an allegation of error, in a finding of fact,
or ruling upon the law, made by the judge upon the trial,
it cannot be heard at a special term, held by another judge;
unless the judge, who presided at the trial, is dead, or his
term of ofiice has expired, or he specially directs the motion
to be heard before another judge. And a trial by a referee
cannot be reviewed, by a motion for a new trial, founded
upon such an allegation, except in a case specified in the

last section.

§ 1003. The provisions of this article, relating to the
proceedings to review a trial by jury, are applicable to the
trial, by a jury, of one or more specific questions of fact,
arising upon the issues, in an action triable by the court.
But, except in a case specified in section 970 of this act, a
new trial may be granted, as tosome of the questions so
tried, and refused as to the others; and an error, in the
admission or exclusion of evidence, or in any other ruling
or direction of the judge, upon the trial, may, in the discretion of the court which reviews it, be disregarded; if
that court is of opinion, that substantial justice does not
require that a new trial should be granted. VVhere the
judge, who presided at the trial, neither entertains a motion
for a new trial, nor directs exceptions, taken at the trial, to
be heard at the general term, a motion for a new trial can
be made only at the term, where the motion for final judgment is made, or the remaining issues of fact are tried, as

the case requires.

§ 1004. In an action triable by the court, where a reference has been made, to report upon one or more specific
questions of fact, involved in the issue, a motion for a new
hearing may be made at a special term, at any time before
the hearing of a motion for final judgment or the trial of

the remaining issues of fact. The motion must be made
upon aflidavits, unless the court, or a judge thereof, directs
a case to be prepared and settled.

§ 1005. The entry of‘ final judgment, and the subsequent
proceedings to collect or otherwise enforce it, are not stayed
by an exception, the preparation or settlement of a case, or
a motion for a new trial, unless an order for such a stay is
procured and served; and the entry, collection, or other
enforcement of a judgment does not prejudice a subsequent
motion for a new trial. Where a new trial is granted, the
court may direct and enforce restitution, as where a judgment is reversed upon appeal.

§ 1006. The taking of an exception, upon a trial by
jury, or the statement thereof in a case, as prescribed in
this article, does not prejudice a motion for a new trial, on
the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence; but
such a motion may be made, before or after the hearing of
the exception; or, in the discretion of the court before which
the exception is heard, at the time of the hearing.

§ 1007. The notes of an official stenographer or assistant-stenographer, taken at a trial, when written out at
length, may be treated, in the discretion of the judge, as
the minutes of the judge upon the trial, for the purposes of

this article. '

1025. Several referees may be appointed.

1026. Proceedings regulated where there are several referees.

§ 1008. In an action triable by a jury, if the parties
waive the trial, by a jury, of the issue of fact, the action
must be tried by the court, without a jury; unless a reference is directed, in a case prescribed by law. But an action,
other than to recover damages for breach of a contract,
cannot be tried by the court, Without a jury, unless the
judge, presiding at the term where it is brought on for trial,
assents to such a trial. If he does not so assent, either
party may revoke a Waiver, made as prescribed in subdivision second, third, or fourth of the next section.

§ 1009. A party may Waive his right to the trial of the
issue of fact, by a jury, in either of the following modes:

1. By failing to appear at the trial.

2. By filing with the clerk a written waiver, signed by
the attorney for the party. °

3. By an oral consent in open court, entered in the minutes.

4. By moving the trial of the action, Without a jury; or,
if the adverse party so moves it, by failing to claim a trial by
a jury, before the production of any evidence upon the trial.

§ 1010. Upon a trial, by the court, of an issue of fact or
of law, its decision, in writing, must be filed, in the clerk’s
office, Within twenty days after the final adjournment of
the term, Where the issue was tried. If it is not so filed,

either party may move, at a special term, for a new trial
upon that ground. If the decision has not been filed,
when the motion is heard, the court must make an order
for a new trial, either absolutely, or unless it is filed, within
a time specihed in the order. If an order for a new trial
is made, or a contingent order for a new trial becomes
absolute, the costs of the former trial abide the event.

§ 1011. Except in a case specified in the next section, the
whole issue, or any of the issues in an action, either of fact
or of law, must be referred, upon the consent of the parties,

manifested by a written stipulation, signed by their attorneys, and filed with the clerk. Where the stipulation does

not name the referee, he may be designated by the court, on
motion of either party. Where the stipulation names the

referee, the clerk must enter an order, of course, referring
the issue or issues for trial, to that person only.

§ 1012. But a reference shall not be made, of course,
upon the consent of the parties, in an action to annul a
marriage, or for a divorce or a separation; or an action
against a corporation, to obtain a dissolution thereof, the
appointment of a receiver of its property, or the distribution of its property, unless it is brought by the attorneygeneral; or an action wherein a defendant, to be affected
by the result of the trial, is an infant. In a case specined
in this section, where the parties consent to a reference, the
court may, in its discretion, grant or refuse a reference;
and, where a reference is granted, the court must designate
the referee.

§ 1013. The court may, of its own motion, or upon the
application of either party, without the consent of the
other, direct a trial of the issues of fact, by a referee, where

the trial will require the examination of a long account, on
either side, and will not require the decision of difficult
questions of law. In an action, triable by the court, without a jury, a reference may be made, as prescribed in this section, to decide the Whole issue, or any of the issues; or
to report the referee’s finding, upon one or more specific
questions of fact, involved in the issue.

§ 1014. Where a reference is made, as prescribed in the
last section, to report upon a specific question of fact, involved in the issue, and the determination of one or more
other issues is necessary, in order to enable the court to
render judgment, they must be tried, either before orafter
the filing of the report, as the court directs, and either by
a jury, or by the court, Without a jury, as the case requires.
Where they are tried by a jury, application for judgment
must be made upon the verdict and the report.

§ 1015. The court may likewise, of its own motion, or
upon the application of either party, Without the consent
of the other, direct a reference to take an account, and
report to the court thereon, either With or without the testimony, after interlocutory or final judgment, or Where it
is necessary to do so, for the information of the court; and
also to determine and report upon a question of fact, arising
in any stage of the action, upon a motion, or otherwise, except upon the pleadings.

§ 1016. A referee, appointed as prescribed in either of
the foregoing sections of this title, must, before proceeding to hear the testimony, be sworn faithfully and fairly
to try the issues, or to determine the questions referred to
him, as the case requires, and to make a just and true report, according to the best of his understanding. The oath
may be administered by an ofiicer specified in section 842
of this act. But Where all the parties, Whose interests will
be affected by-the result of the trial, are of age, and present,
in person or by attorney, they may expressly Waive the
referee’s oath. The Waiver may be made by written stipulation, or orally. If it is oral, it must be entered in the
referee’s minutes.

§ 1017. A Witness may be subpoenaed to attend before
a referee, appointed as prescribed in either of the foregoing sections of this title, to testify, and, in a proper case, to
bring with him a book, document, or other paper, as upon a
trial by the court.

§ 1018. The trial, by a referee, of an issue of fact, or of
an issue of law, must be brought on upon like notice, and
conducted in like manner, and the papers to be furnished
thereupon are the same, and are furnished in like manner,
as where the trial is by the court, without a jury. The
referee exercises, upon such a trial, the same power as the
court, to grant adjournments, to preserve order, and punish
the violation thereof. Upon the trial of an issue of fact,
the referee exercises also the same power as the court, to
allow amendments to the summons, or to the pleadings ; to
compel the attendance of a witness by attachment; and to
punish a witness for a contempt of court, for non-attendance, or refusal to be sworn, or to testify. Upon the trial
of an issue of law, the referee exercises the same power as
the court, to permit a party in fault to plead anew or amend;
to direct the action to be divided into two or more actions ; to
award costs, and otherwise to dispose of any question, arising upon the decision of the issue referred to him. The
powers, conferred by this section, are exercised in like manner, and upon like terms, as similar powers are exercised by
the court, upon a trial.

§ 1019. Upon the trial, by a referee, of an issue of fact,
or an issue of law, his written report must be either filed
with the clerk, or delivered to the attorney for one of the
parties, within sixty days from the time when the cause is
finally submitted ; otherwise either party may, before it is filed
or delivered, serve a notice, upon the attorney for the adverse
party, that he elects to end the reference. In such a case,
the action must thenceforth proceed, as if the reference

had not been directed; and the referee is not entitled to
any fees.

§ 1020. Where double, treble, or other. increased damages are given by statute, the decision of the court, or the
report of the referee, must specify the sum awarded as
single damages, and direct judgment for the increased
damages.

§ 1021. The decision of the court, or the report of a referee, upon the trial of a demurrer, must direct the judgment to be entered thereupon, or other disposition of the
cause, as prescribed in section 1018 of this act.

§ 1022. The decision of the court, or the report of the
referee, upon the trial of the whole issue of fact, must state
separately the facts found, and the conclusions of law; and

it must direct the judgment, to be entered thereupon. In an
action, where the costs are in the discretion of the court, the

decision or report must award or deny costs; and, if it
awards costs, it must designate the party to whom costs, to
be taxed, are awarded. Where the trial is by the court,
the decision must also fix the amount of the extra allowance, if any, to be added to the costs on taxation.

§ 1023. Before the cause is finally submitted to the
court or the referee, or within such time afterwards, and
before the decision or report is rendered, as the court or
referee allows, the attorney for either party may submit, in
writing, a statement of the facts, which he deems established
by the evidence, and of the rulings upon questions of law,
which he desires the court or the referee to make. The
statement must be in the form of distinct propositions of
law, or of fact, or both, separately stated; each of which
must be numbered, and so prepared, with respect to its
length, and the subject and phraseology thereof, that the
court or referee may conveniently pass upon it. At or
before the time, when the decision or report is rendered, the
court or the referee must note, in the margin of the statement, the manner in which each proposition has been disposed of, and must either file, or return to the attorney, the
statement thus noted; but an omission so to do does not
aifect, the validity of the decision or report.

§ 1024. A referee, appointed by the court, must be free
from all just objections; and no person shall be so appointed,
to Whom all the parties object, except in an action to annul
a marriage, or for a divorce, or a separation. A judge cannot be appointed a referee, in an action brought in the
court, of which he is a judge, except by the Written consent
of the parties; and, in that case, he cannot receive any compensation as referee.

§ 1025. Where the court is authorized to appoint a
referee, it may, in its discretion, appoint either one or three.
And Where a reference is made by consent of the parties,
they may select any number of referees, not exceeding iive.

§ 1026. Where the reference is to more than one referee,
all must meet together, and hear all the allegations and
proofs of the parties; but a majority may appoint a time
and place for the trial, decide any question which arises
upon the trial, sign a report, or settle a case. . Either of
them may administer an oath to a Witness ; and a majority
of those present, at atime and place appointed for the trial,
may adjourn the trial to a future day.

punishment, and the same proceedings must be taken, as if
he had failed to attend, at the time fixed in the notice
given to him.

§ 1086. Except as prescribed in the last section, a court
or a judge shall not excuse a person, liable to serve as a
trial juror, and duly drawn and notified, unless it is shown,

or a near relative of himself or his wife, has recently died

or is dangerously sick. Where a person liable to serve is
excused, in a case specified in this section, or where a person, notified to attend a term, as a trial juror, is entitled to,
and claims an exemption, he can be excused only by the
judge, holding the term, which he has been notified to
attend. Such an excuse does not extend beyond that term.

§ 1087. A person, who has been notified to attend, as a
trial juror, and who applies to be excused, as prescribed in
the last section, must bring the notice, if he has received it,
into court, and present it, in open court, to the judge; or, if

failure or refusal. One or more successive notices may be
served upon the same person, where he fails to attend, as
required by a former notice; and he is liable to the same

attendance of a person so notified, where another person,
cognizant of the facts, is produced and testifies in his

stead; and Where a person has so attended twice, he cannot be required to attend again, in the same jury year.

§ 1096. On or before the first day of October, in each

If a delinquent trtal juror, duly drawn, and returned by the
sheriff as personally notified to attend a term, or personally
notiiied to attend before the commissioner, as prescribed in
the last section but one, is, in the opinion of the board, able
to pay his fine, the board may make an order, directing the
sheriE to arrest him, and imprison him in the county jail,
until the fine is paid, not exceeding thirty days. The sheriff
must obey such an order. The board may make an order,
directing that a person, paying a fine imposed upon him,

fine, as prescribed in the last section but one, if the fine
has not been remitted or paid, the commissioner must issue

a warrant, under his hand, directed to the sheriff of the
city and county of New-York, reciting the facts, and commanding the sheriff to collect from each person, named in
the schedule annexed thereto, the sum, set opposite that
person’s name in the schedule, and to pay over the same to
the commissioner. The schedule must contain the names of
persons, fined and notified to show cause, Whose fines have
not been Wholly paid or remitted; it must show the amount
of each £ne, remaining unremitted or unpaid ; and the residence or usual place of business of each person fined, as far
as it can be conveniently ascertained. The sheriff‘ must
collect each fine, by a levy upon and sale of the personal
property of the person fined, as prescribed by law, Where
an execution against property is issued upon a judgment,
rendered in a court of record. The sheriff‘ is entitled, in
each case, to the same fees as upon such an execution, to be
collected in the same manner. He must return the Warrant
and schedule, with his proceedings thereupon, to the commissioner, Within thirty days after the delivery thereof to him;
and must then pay over the money collected, less his fees.
His return may be compelled by the supreme court, in the
same manner as the return of an execution against property, issued upon a judgment rendered in that court. For
his failure to collect a fine, an action may be maintained
against him, in a case Where such an action may be main-'
tained by a judgment creditor, against a sheriff failing to
collect an execution against property, and with like effect.
The provisions of section 1119 of this act apply to such an
action.

§ 1117. The commissioner must, Within thirty days after ,
the return of the Warrant to him, file with the clerk of

the court, by which each uncollected line Was imposed, a
certificate, to the effect that the Warrant has been returned,
and showing What fines remain uncollected. Thereupon the
clerk must make, in the docket-book of judgments, kept by
him, the same entries, as nearly as may be, with respect to
each uncollected fine, as if it was a final judgment, rendered
in an action. If the line was imposed by a court, other
than the supreme court, the clerk thereof must immediately
transmit a transcript of the entries, to the clerk of the city
and county of New-York, Who must file it, and make the
appropriate entries, in his docket-book of judgments. The
commissioner must pay the clerks’ fees, at the rate allowed
for similar services, With respect to judgments. When the
entries have been made, the fine, with interest, becomes a
lien upon the real property of the person fined, as if it Was
recovered by a judgment in the same court; and an execution to collect it may be issued, directed to the sheriff of
the city and county of New-York, as upon such a judgment.
The commissioner has, in relation to the execution, and the
satisfaction of the line, all the powers of the attorney for
a party recovering such a judgment, in relation to the 
ment, and the execution issued thereupon.

§ 1118. The commissioner of jurors must receive all
money, paid or collected for lines or penalties, as prescribed
in this article; and he may make all payments therefrom,
which he is authorized by this article to make. He must
give a receipt for. any money paid to him, for a nne or

penalty. He must keep a just and faithful account of all
receipts and payments, by items, showing the name of the
‘person, from whom each sum of money was received, and to
whom each sum of money was paid; and must, at all reasonable times, keep his account open to public inspection. At
the end of each calendar year, his account must be verified by
his afiidavit, to the effect, that it is, in all respects, just and
true; and that he has not received any sum of money, during the year, for which he has not charged himself in the
account. The account, thus verified, must be audited and
certified, by at least three other members of the board for
the enforcement of jury fines; and the commissioner must
thereupon pay over, to the chamberlain of the city, the balance, if any, in his hands. The account, thus audited and
certified, must immediately be transmitted by the commissioner, to the clerk of the board of aldermen; and must be
published in the newspaper, designated, as prescribed by
law, for the publication of the oiiicial proceedings of city
ofiicers.

§ 1119. The corporation attorney of the city of NewYork must, when required by the commissioner of jurors,
prosecute, in the proper court, an action for the collection of
each penalty, incurred as prescribed in this article; unless
he is satisfied, upon an examination of the case, that there

suitable persons to serve as trial jurors. In making the
returns or selection, the assessors and the commissioner
respectively must take the names of those persons only,
Whom they believe to be qualified to serve, and not exempt
from service, as trial jurors. A list of the names so selected
must be made, by the commissioner, in a book, specifying,
as nearly as he has ascertained the facts, the occupation,
the place of business, and the residence of each person,
including the town, or, in the city of Brooklyn, the Ward.
In the list, the towns must be arranged alphabetically, and

“ exempt ”, in the list, opposite the name of each person,
found to be disqualified to serve, or exempt from serving as
a trial juror, as the case requires. He must also record

§ 1137. On the first Monday of August in each year, or
earlier, if the corrections can be earlier made, the commissioner must prepare the list of trial jurors for the year,
by copying, from his book, the names of all persons, who
appear therein to be liable to serve as trial jurors, with the
proper additions of each. The commissioner must iile a
transcript of the list, verified by his affidavit, in the office

of the county clerk.

§ 1138. Supplemental lists, containing the names and
proper additions of persons, subsequently ascertained to be
liable to serve as trial jurors, may, from time to time thereafter, be made; and transcripts thereof, verified as presplribed in the last selcgtilcin, must be filed 111: like manner, by
t e commissioner. a ots, containing t ose names, must
be prepared, as prescribed in the next section, and used, in
like manner as the other ballots therein specified, for the
residue of the jury year.

§ 1139. The commissioner must prepare ballots, by writing the names, contained in the list, a transcript of which
was filed in the oiiice of the county clerk, with the proper
additions of each person, on separate pieces of paper, which
must be uniform, as nearly as may be, in appearance. On
the second Monday of August in each year, he must deposit
the ballots, in the box kept by him for that purpose, and
must place his seal upon the box; whereupon all jury ballots, previously in use, must be destroyed. The box must
be constructed with an aperture, large enough only to conveniently admit the hand of the person, by whom the ballots
are to be drawn; and the aperture must be provided with
a cover, so arranged as to be conveniently sealed, when
closed.

§ 1140. The commissioner must seasonably notify the
justices of the supreme court, residing in the county, the
judges of the city court of Brooklyn, the county judge, and
the justices of sessions of the county, to attend, at his office,
on a day designated by him, not less than fourteen nor more
than twenty days, before the day appointed for holding a
term of a court of record in the county, at which issues of
fact are triable by jury, in order to witness and assist in
the drawing of trial jurors, for that term. The number of
trial jurors, to be drawn for each term, may be fixed by
the judge who is to preside at or hold the term, by an order
under his hand, delivered to the commissioner. If the number has not been so fixed, at the time of the drawing, one
hundred and thirty-two trial jurors must be drawn for the
term.

§ 1141. If two or more of the judges, specified in the last section, attend with or without one or more justices of,

sessions, the commissioner must break the seal of the box,
containing the ballots, open it, and exhibit the ballots for

‘ their inspection; together with his original and each supple.

mental list of trial jurors, and also the verified transcripts
thereof, filed in the county clerk’s office. The ballots, containing the names of trial jurors, excused from service, for
the whole or a portion of a previous term of a court of
record in the county, which have not already been replaced
in the box, to be redrawn, must then be replaced therein;
and the judges, attending the drawing, must take care,
when the seal is broken, that they are so replaced. If
a supplemental list has been made, and a transcript iiled
since the last drawing, ballots, containing the names
appearing therein, must, at the same time, be placed in
the box. The judges and the commissioner, or a majority
of them, must appoint one of the attending oiiicers to draw
the ballots from the box, and another to checkmark the
drawing, as it proceeds, upon a copy of the lists, transcripts of "which have been filed with the county clerk.

§ 1142. The commissioner must then shake the box;
containing the ballots, so as thoroughly to mix them. The

person, appointed for that purpose, must then, without
seeing the name contained in any ballot, publicly draw one
ballot from the box, and read aloud the contents thereof.
If the drawing is for trial jurors, to serve in the city court
of Brooklyn, and the person drawn does not reside in that
city, the ballot must be returned to the box; but if he
resides in that city, or if the drawing is for trial jurors, to
serve in another court, the person, appointed to checkmark
the drawing, must place, opposite the name of the person
drawn, upon the copy of the lists, the figure 1. The ballot

Imust then be deposited in a second box, provided for that

purpose, and constructed like the first box. Another ballot must then be drawn, in like manner, from the first box:
and the same process must be repeated, until the requisite
number has been drawn; except that each name must be
checkmarked in its numerical order.

§ 1143. When the drawing is completed, the commisI sioner, and the judges by whom it Was conducted, must sign a
“ minute, at the end of the copy of the lists, upon which the

checkmarks have been made, setting forth that the trial
jurors, whose names are contained therein, were duly drawn
by them, for the court and the term therein specified, in the
order denoted by the figures. The -judges must then close
each box; and place, upon the cover thereof, their seals,
which must not be broken, except when necessary for a
subsequent drawing. ’

§ 1144. The proceedings, upon each subsequent drawing,
are the same; but the list, must be checkmarked with numbers, commencing with the number next in order, after the
last number used at the preceding drawing.

§ 1145. After all the ballots have been drawn from the
first box, and deposited in the second box, the commissioner
must make a new list, by copying the lists used upon the
preceding drawings, omitting the checkmarks. He must
then correct it, by properly indicating each person who has
been found to be disqualified, exempt, dead, or not resident
within the county; and each person, who has been excused,
and for what time. Thereafter, when trial jurors are drawn,
the ballots must be drawn from the second box ; the names
must be checkmarked on the corrected list; and the ballots
not used must be deposited in the first box; except that
where a ballot is drawn, containing the name of a person
indicated, on the corrected list, as disqualified, exempt, dead,
or non-resident, it must be destroyed; and a ballot, containing the name of a person Who has been excused, for a period
then unexpired, must be returned to the box from which it
was drawn, Without checkmarking.

§ 1146. Immediately after each drawing of trial jurors,
the commissioner must prepare a panel, verified by his ailidavit, containing the names of the jurors drawn, with the
proper additions of each, and stating for What court and for
What term, they Were drawn. He must transmit the panel
to the sheriif of the county, Who must keep it on hle, in his
ofiice, for public inspection. The sheriif must forthwith
notify each juror named therein, to attend the term for
Which he Was drawn, by serving upon him a notice to that
effect, addressed to him. The notice may be served personally, or by leaving it at the juror’s residence, or usual
place of business, with a person of proper age and discretion. It must specify the days, during Which the juror ls
required to be present; and it may contain copies of such
portions of this article, as the sheriff deems proper.

§ 1147. The thirty-six trial jurors, first drawn for a term,
or such other number as the judge, appointed to hold or.
preside at the term, directs, must be notified to be present,
during the first six days of the term; and the thirty-six.
trial jurors next drawn, or such other number as the judge 3
directs, must be notified to be present, during the next six 
days of the term; and a like number during each succeeding
six days. The judge, holding or presiding at the term, may,
in his discretion, on the application of a trial juror, excuse
him, from the Whole or a part of the time of service, required
of him. The judge may also change the time of service of
a juror to a later day, during the same, or a subsequent
term of the court. Each juror, Whose time of service is
changed to a day certain, must attend, at the opening of
court on that day, and thereafter until discharged, Without further notice. If he fails so to do, he is liable to the
same punishment, as if he had been personally notihed by
the sheriif, to attend the term, and to be present on that

“day. The clerk of the court must enter in a book, kept

for that purpose, the name of each juror, who is so excused,
or whose time of service is changed.

§ 1148. Before the commencement of each term of a
court, for which trial jurors have been drawn, as prescribed
in this article, the sheriff must file, with the clerk, the panel,
or a copy of the panel, with a return, under his hand, indorsed thereupon, or annexed thereto, showing the name and
additions of each juror notified, the days during which he
was notified to attend, and the manner in which he was
notified.

§ 1149. At any time during the sitting of a term of a
court of record in the county, the court may direct
an additional number of trial jurors, to be drawn for
that term. The order must specify the number to be drawn,
and the time of drawing. The drawing must be conducted
as prescribed in sections 1141, 1142, and 1143 of this act,
but without previous notice. The sheriif must forthwith
notify each juror drawn, in such manner as the court directs,
to attend the term, at the time specified in the order.

§ 1150. In a special proceeding, pending before the
county judge of Kings county, in which a trial jury is
necessary, the judge may impanel a jury, from the trial
jurors, who are serving, at the time, in the court of sessions of the county. In a special proceeding, pending
before a judge of the city court of Brooklyn, in which a
trial jury is necessary, the judge may impanel a jury,
from the trial jurors, who are serving, at the time, in
that court. If there are no jurors serving in the court
of sessions, or in the city court, as the case may be, the
judge may make an order, requiring the commissioner
of jurors to draw the number of trial jurors, designated
therein; whereupon the commissioner must draw the requi.
site number, and the sheriff must notify them, as prescribed
in this article, for drawing and notifying other trial jurors.

§ 1151. The board of supervisors of the county must

allow to each judge, including each justice of the supreme A

court, for the services performed by him, as prescribed in
this article, such compensation, as the board deems reasonable and proper.

§ 1152. Where a person, duly drawn and notified to
attend a term of a court of record, as a trial juror, fails to
attend, at the time specified in the notice, or from day to
day, the court, at that term, must impose upon him a fine
of twenty-five dollars, for each day that he fails so to
attend. This section applies to a special juror, as Well as
to an ordinary trial juror.

§ 1153. Where a person, duly drawn and notified, fails
to attend and serve, at a term of a court of record, as
required by law, Without having been excused, the court,
besides imposing a fine, as prescribed in the last section,
may direct the sheriE to arrest him, and bring him before
the court; and, when he has been so brought, it may, in its
discretion, compel him to serve.

§ 1154. The commissioner of jurors must cause a notice
to be served upon each delinquent trial juror, returned as
having been fined, stating the sum in which, and the term
at Which he was fined, and requiring him to show cause,
if he has any, before the board, specified in this section,
at the commissioner’s ofiice, on a day, not less than three
days thereafter, and at an hour specified in the notice,
Why the fine should be remitted. The commissioner must
notify the justices of the supreme court, residing in the
county, the county judge, and the chief-judge of the city
court of Brooklyn, to attend at the same time and place,
and act with him as a board, for the remission and enforcement of jury fines. It is their duty to attend, and act
accordingly. The commissioner, and two of those justices
or judges, constitute a quorum. The board may, in its discretion, hear testimony; and it may, from time to time,

adjourn the meeting, or the hearing or final disposition of
a particular case. It may remit the Whole or any part of a
fine; but a line shall not be remitted or reduced, unless the
person, upon Whom it has been imposed, or, if a reason
satisfactory to the board is given, why his afiidavit cannot
be furnished, another person in his behalf, makes, and files
with the commissioner, an affidavit, stating the grounds,
upon which a remission or reduction is claimed. Each ailidavit, so filed, must be kept open to public inspection. “

§ 1155. The commissioner of jurors must receive each
line, paid or collected, as prescribed in this article. When
ten days have expired, since the final disposition of a case
by the board, the commissioner must file, in the ofiice of the
clerk of the court, a return, containing the name of each
juror fined, Whose flue remains unpaid, and a statement of
the sum remaining unpaid. The clerk must thereupon issue
to the commissioner, a precept, under the seal of the court,
specifying the name of each person fined, and the amount
of his fine remaining unpaid; and commanding the commissioner to levy and enforce collection of each fine, and to
return the precept, With his doings thereupon, Within ninety
days after the receipt thereof. For the purpose of collecting a fine, the commissioner must levy upon and sell the
personal property of a person lined, with like effect, and
subject to the same provisions of law, as Where a sheriff
levies upon and sells personal property, by virtue of an
execution, issued upon a judgment of a court of record.

§ 1156. The commissioner must return the precept, ac
cording to its command, to the clerk of the court issuing it.‘
If he fails so to do, the court may enforce the return, by
attachment for contempt. When the precept is returned,
the clerk must make, in the docket of judgments kept by
him, the same entries, as nearly as may be, With respect to
each uncollected fine, as if it was a final judgment, rendered
in an action. If the ‘due was imposed at a term of the city
court of Brooklyn, the clerk thereof must immediately

transmit a transcript of the entries, to the clerk of the
county of Kings; who must ‘rile it, and make the appropriate entries in his docket of judgments. When the

entries have been made, the fine, with interest, becomes
a lien upon the real property of the person fined, as if it
was recovered by a judgment in the same court; and an
execution to collect it may be issued, directed to the sheriif
of the county of Kings, as upon a judgment. The commissioner has, in relation to the execution, and the satisfaction
of the line, all the powers of the attorney for a party recovering such a judgment, in relation to the judgment, and the
execution issued thereupon.

§ 1157. The lien, created by such a docket, must be discharged by the county clerk, on filing with him the commissioner’s certiiicate of payment.

§ 1158. If the commissioner of jurors, or either of his
assistants, or a clerk or other person, employed by him, corruptly and without sufficient cause, omits the name of a
person, duly drawn, from a panel of trial jurors, or the ballot, containing the name of such a person, from either of
the boxes prescribed in this article; or, directly or indirectly,
receives a fee, reward, compensation, or advantage, in consideration of, or as an inducement to such an omission; he
is guilty of a felony, and shall, on conviction, be punished
by imprisonment in a State prison, for a term not less
than two, nor more than five years.


§ 1159. A wilful omission, by the commissioner, of a
duty required of him by this article, other than that speci- 
fied in the last section, is a misdemeanor. ‘

§ 1160. A person, to whom application is made, withinj
the county of Kings, by an assessor, or by the commissioner
of jurors, or either of his assistants, for information, as to a_=
fact, upon which the liability of himself, or any other per- 
son, to serve as a trial juror, depends, and who refuses to5

give information relating thereto, which he can give, or
knowingly gives false information relating thereto; or a
person who knowingly makes to an assessor, or to the commissioner of jurors, or a person acting by his authority, a
false representation as to the identity, residence, or any
other matter, relating to a juror, duly drawn, and placed on
a panel to be notified ; or who knowingly retains, conceals.
suppresses, or wilfully destroys, a notice to attend, left at the
residence or place of business of another, who has been
drawn at trial juror, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1161. A physician, who knowingly gives a false certificate, or makes a false representation, for the purpose of
enabling or assisting a person, to be discharged, excused, or
exempted from service, as a trial juror in the county of
Kings, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1162. The commissioner of jurors must make a yearly
report to the board of supervisors, of all proceedings had
before him, or by him, in the discharge of his duties; and
he must pay over to the county treasurer, at least once in

each three months, all money in his hands, which he has
received as commissioner.

§ 1163. At the opening of a term of a court of record at

cause ballots, uniform, as nearly as may be, in appearance,
to be prepared, by writing the name of each person, returned
to the term as a trial juror, with his proper additions, on a
separate piece of paper. He must roll up or fold each
ballot, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, so as to
resemble the others, and so that the name is not visible.
The ballots must be deposited in a sufficient box, from

which they must be drawn, as prescribed in this article.

§ 1164. When an issue of fact, to be tried by a jury,
is brought to trial, the clerk, under the direction of the
court, must openly draw, out of the box, as many of the
ballots, one after another, as are sufficient to form a jury.

§ 1165. Before the first ballot is drawn, the box must de
closed and well shaken, so as thoroughly to mix the ballots;
and the clerk must draw each ballot, without seeing the
name written on any of them, through an aperture, made in
the lid of the box, large enough only to admit his hand

conveniently.

§ 1166. The first twelve persons who appear, as their
names are drawn and called, and are approved as indifferent

between the parties, and not discharged or excused, must ,

be sworn; and constitute the jury to try the issue.

§ 1167. The ballots, containing the names of the jurors
so sworn, must be then deposited in another box, and there
kept, apart from the other ballots, until that my is discharged.

§ 1168. After that  is discharged, the ballots containing their names must be again rolled up or folded, as
prescribed in section 1163 of this act, and returned to the
box, from which they Were hrsttaken; and the same course
must be pursued, as often as an issue is brought to trial by

a jury.

§ 1169. The ballot, containing the name of a juror, who
is absent, when his name is drawn or called, or is set aside,
or excused from serving on that trial, must be again rolled
up or folded, in the same manner as before, and returned
to the box, containing the undrawn ballots, as soon as the
jury is sworn.

§ 1170. If an issue is brought to trial by a jury, While
a jury is empanelled in another cause, at the same term,

and not then discharged, the court may order a jury, for

the trial of that issue, to be drawn, out of the box containing the ballots then undrawn; but, in any other case, the
ballots,containing the names of all the trial jurors, returned
at, and attending the term, must be placed together in the
same box, before a jury is drawn therefrom.

§ 1171. If a suiiicient number of jurors, duly drawn and
notified, do not attend, or cannot be obtained, to form a trial
jury, the court may, in any county except Westchester,
direct the sheriff to require the attendance of such a number
of talesmen, from the bystanders, or from the county at
large, qualified to serve as trial jurors, as it deems
sufficient for the purpose. In VVestchester county, the court
must, and in any other county, except New-York and Kings,

it may, in its discretion, instead of directing the sheriff to
require talesmen to attend, direct him to draw a sumcient
number of ballots from the third box, kept by the county
clerk, as prescribed in title third of this chapter, and‘ to
notify the persons thus drawn, to attend. If, for any
reason, a sumcient number of jurors to try the issue is
not obtained, from the persons notified, under an order
made as prescribed in this section, the court may make
another order, or successive orders, until a suiiicient number ‘is obtained; and in making each order, the court may
exercise the same discretion, as in making the first order.

§ 1172. In any county, except New-York, Kings, or
Westchester, the court may also direct the sheriff to require
the attendance of such a number of qualified talesmen, for
the trial of an issue of fact, as it deems sufficient, where,
by reason of one or more juries being empanelled, or for
any other reason, no ballot remains undrawn; or where,
in consequence of jurors being set aside, a juror cannot be
obtained, for the trial of that issue, from the list of those

returned.

§ 1173. If, in a case specified in the last two sections, the
sheriff is a party to the issue, the court must appoint a disinterested person, to act in place of” the sheriE. For that
purpose, the person so appointed possesses all the powers,

and is subject to all the duties and liabilities of the sheriff,
with respect to the matters specified in those sections.

§ 1174. The sheriE, or person appointed by the court,
must notify the requisite number of persons to attend, and
make return thereof, as prescribed in section 1048 of this
act; except that each person must be required to attend
forthwith. Each person so notified must attend forthwith,
and, unless excused by the court or set aside, must serve as
a juror upon the trial. For a neglect or refusal so to do,
he may be fined, in the same manner as a trial juror, reguilarly drawn and notified, as prescribed in this chapter; and
he is subject to the same exceptions and challenges, as any
other trial juror.

§ 1175. It is not a valid objection to a jury, procured as
prescribed in the last four sections, that it contains none of
the jurors originally returned to the term.

§ 1176. Upon the trial of an issue of fact, joined in a
1 civil action, in a court of record, or not of record, each party
may peremptorily challenge not more than two of the persons, drawn as jurors for the trial.

§ 1177. It is not a good cause of challenge, to the panel
or array of trial jurors, in an action in a court of record,
that the oflicer who drew them is a party to, or interested
.in the action, or counsel or attorney for, or related to, a.

party.

§ 1178. It is not a good cause "of challenge to the panel
or array of trial jurors, in an action in a court of record,
that they Were notified to attend by an oflicer, who is a
. party to, or interested in, the action, or related to a party;
unless it is alleged in the challenge, and is established, that
one or more of the jurors drawn were not notified, and that
the omission Was intentional.

§ 1179. In a penal action, in a court of record, or not of

record, to recover a sum of money, it is not a good cause
of challenge to a trial juror, or to an oflicer who notified

the trial jurors, that the juror or the officer is liable to pay
taxes, in a city, town, or county, which may be benefited

by the recovery.

§ 1180. A challenge of a juror, or a challenge to the
panel or array of jurors, must be tried and determined by

the court only. Either party may except to the determination, and it may be reviewed, upon a question of fact, or a
question of law, or both, as where an issue of fact presented
by the pleadings is tried by the court; except that where
one or more exceptions are taken, to the rulings of the court,
made after the jury is empanelled, an exception to the
determination of a challenge must be heard at the same
time; and the case must contain the matters necessary to
present it, upon the facts, or the law, or both.

before which, or the ofiicer before whom, they were empanelled, the court or officer may discharge them, and issue a
precept for a new jury, or order another jury to be drawn, as
the case requires; and the same proceedings must be had
before the new jury, as if it was the jury first empanelled.

§ 1182. It is not necessary, in an action in a court of

under the direction of the court, are tried by a jury, the
court may direct the jury to find a special verdict, upon all
or any of the issues. Where the jury finds a general ' verdict, the court may instruct it to find also specially, upon
one or more questions of fact, stated in Writing. The special verdict or special finding must be in Writing; it must
be filed with the clerk, and entered in the minutes.

§ 1188. Where a special finding is inconsistent with
a general verdict, the former controls the latter, and the

court must render judgment accordingly.

§ 1189. When the jury renders a verdict, or finds upon

minutes, specifying the time and place of the trial; the

questions and findings thereupon, as the case requires; and

the non-payment of which constitutes a cause of action,
stated in the complaint; and by ascertaining, by the examination of the plaintiff, upon oath, or by other competent
proof, the amount due to him for any other cause of action,
stated in the complaint. If an instrument, specified in this subdivision, has been lost, so that it cannot be produced

the clerk can enter final judgment, as prescribed in the last ‘

two sections, the plaintiff must apply to the court for judgment. Upon the application he must file, if the default
was in appearing, proof of service of the summons; or, if
the default was in pleading, proof of appearance, and of
service of a copy of the complaint upon the defendant’s
attorney; and, in either case, proof, by aflidavit, of the default which entitles him to judgment.

§ 1215. The court must thereupon render the judgment,
to which the plaintiff is entitled. It may make a computation or assessment, or take an account, or proof of a fact,
for the purpose of enabling it to render the judgment, or
to carry it into effect; or it may, in its discretion, direct a
reference, or a writ of inquiry, for either purpose; except
that where the action is brought to recover damages for a
personal injury, or an injury to property, the damages must
be ascertained by means of a writ of inquiry. Where a
reference or a writ of inquiry is directed, the court may
direct, that the report or inquisition be returned to the
court, for its future action; or it may, in its discretion,
except where special provision is otherwise made by law,
omit that direction; in which case, final judgment may be
entered, in accordance with the report of the referee, or for
the damages ascertained by the inquisition, without any
further application.

the complaint. Upon such an application, the court must
require proof of the cause of action, set forth in the complaint, to be made, either before the court, or before a referee, appointed for that purpose. If the defendant is a nonresident, and the complaint demands judgment for a sum
of money, as damages for the breach of a contract, with or

lien upon property, for a sum of money, or satisfying, or
enforcing, in any other manner, a demand for a sum of
money; the court must require the plaintiff, or his agent or
attorney, to be examined on oath, respecting any payments
to the plaintiff, or to any one for his use, on account of his
demand. Upon hearing the proof, or upon the report of
the referee, the court must render the judgment, to which
the plaintiff is entitled. But before rendering judgment,
the court may, in any case, in its "discretion, require the
plaintiff to file an undertaking, as prescribed in subdivision
third of the next section; or a like undertaking, With the
additional provision, that, in the contingency therein specified, the plaintiff will abide the direction of the court,
touching the restitution of any property, of Which the judgment directs the transfer or delivery.

money only, upon an application made pursuant to the last section, except in an action specified in section 635 of this
act. \Vhere the defendant is a non-resident, or a foreign
corporation, the plaintiff, upon the application for judgment in such an action, must produce and file the following papers:

the time and place of an assessment by the clerk, or of the
execution of a reference, or of a Writ of inquiry; and to
at least eight days’ notice of the time and place of an application to the court, for judgment.

2. In a case Where an application for judgment must be
made to the court, the defendant may serve upon the plaintiif’s attorney, at any time before the application for judgment, a Written demand of notice of the execution of any reference, or writ of inquiry, which may be granted upon the
application. Such a demand is not an appearance in the
action. It must be subscribed by the defendant, in person,
or by an attorney or agent, who must add to his signature
his office address, With the particulars, prescribed in section
417 of this act, concerning the office address of the plaintiff’s attorney. Thereupon at least five days’ notice of the

inquiry, must be given to the defendant, by service thereof
upon him, or upon his attorney or agent, Whose name is subscribed to the demand, as prescribed in this act, for service
of a paper upon an attorney in an action.

§ 1220. Where an issue of law and an issue of fact
arise, With respect to different causes of action, set forth in
the complaint, and final judgment can be taken, with respect
to one or more of the causes of action, without prejudice to
either party in maintaining the action, or a defence or

counterclaim, with respect to the other causes of action,
or in the recovery of fmal judgment upon the whole issue,
the court may, in its discretion, and at any stage of the
action, direct that the action be divided into two or more
actions, as the case requires.

§ 1221. Where one or more issues of law, and one or
more issues of fact, arise in the same action, and all the
issues have been tried, final judgment upon the whole issue
must be taken, upon an application therefor, founded upon
the interlocutory judgment, rendered upon the trial of the
issues of law, and the verdict, report, or decision, upon the
issues of fact, as follows:

1. Where an application must be made to the court, for
judgment upon the issue last tried, the application must
be for judgment, upon the whole issue; and judgment must
be rendered accordingly. _

last tried is tried at a term of the court, the application for
judgment, upon the whole issue, may be entertained, in the
discretion of the court, at that term, and with or without
notice ; if ' not so entertained, it must be heard as a motion.

3. Where the issue last tried is tried before a referee, his
report must award the proper judgment upon the whole

§ 1223. Upon an application, by either party, to the court,
for final judgment, after an interlocutory judgment upon
an issue of law, as prescribed in the last two sections, the
court has the powers specified in section 1215 of this act,

or proof of a fact, for the purpose of enabling him to award
the proper judgment, or enabling the court to carry it into
effect; and he may ascertain and fix the damages, as a jury
may do, upon the execution of a Writ of inquiry.

§ 1224. Where an interlocutory judgment is Wholly or
partly affirmed, upon an appeal to the general term, and no
issue of fact remains to be tried, the general term mu st, if
the interlocutory judgment was rendered upon the trial of
a demurrer, and, in any other case, it may, in its discretion,
render final judgment; unless it permits the appellant to
amend, or plead over. For the purpose of thus rendering
final judgment, the general term may direct any additional
papers in the action, to be brought before it; and it has the
power and authority of the court, upon an application for
judgment, Where the defendant has made default in pleading. It may also direct the proceedings, to determine the
final judgment, to be taken before a judge of the court, and
the final judgment to be entered, when so determined, as
of the term where the interlocutory judgment was affirmed.
In that case, the judge has the powers, conferred by this section on the general term, for the purpose of rendering
final judgment. ‘Where the general term does not render
‘dual judgment, upon such an affirmance, the proceedings to
take final judgment are the same, as if the appeal had not
been taken.

§ 1225. In an action triable by the court, Where one or
more specific questions of fact, arising upon the issues, have
been tried by a jury, judgment may be taken, upon the
application of either party, as follows :

1. If all the issues of fact in the action are determined
by the findings of the jury, or the remaining issues of fact
have been determined by the decision of the court, or the
report of a referee, an application for judgment, upon the
whole issue, may be made as upon a motion.

2. If one or_ more issues of fact remain to be tried, judgment may be rendered upon the whole issue, at the term of
the court where, or by direction of the referee by whom,
they are tried. '

§ 1226. Where a reference has been made, to report upon

and judgment must be rendered by the court.

§ 1230. In a case, not provided for in the foregoing sections of this article, where the decision, upon a trial by
the court, without a jury, or the report, upon a trial by a
referee, directs an interlocutory judgment to be entered,

motion. And where an interlocutory judgment, or a final
judgment, requires the appointment of a referee, to do any
act thereunder, the referee must be appointed by the court,
upon motion, except as otherwise prescribed in the next section.

§ 1231. In an action triable by the court, an interlocutory judgment, rendered upon a default in appearing or
pleading, or pursuant to the direction contained in a decision or report, may state the substance of the final judgment,
to which the party will be entitled. It may also direct,
that the final judgment be settled by a judge, or a referee.
In that case, final judgment shall not be entered, until a
settlement thereof, subscribed by the judge or referee, is
filed. Where an interlocutory judgment awards costs,
they may be awarded generally, without specifying the
amount thereof. Where the final judgment is directed to
be settled, and the costs have not been taxed, when the
settlement thereof is filed, a blank for the amount of the
costs must be left in the settlement; and the costs must
be taxed, and the blank filled up accordingly, by the clerk,

affidavit, that error was committed, to his prejudice, upon
the hearing, or in the report, or upon the execution of the
writ, or in the inquisition. In a proper case, the application may be granted, after judgment has been entered. In

that case, the judgment may be set aside, either then or
after the new hearing, or the execution of the new writ, as

and must be heard and decided at the general term.

§ 1235. Where iinal judgment is rendered for a sum of
money, awarded by a verdict, report, or decision, interest

any report, decision, or writ of inquiry, and return thereto.
If judgment is taken after a trial, the judgment-roll must
contain the verdict, report, or decision ; each offer, if any,
made as prescribed in this act; and each notice of exceptions or case, then on file.

§ 1238. The judgment-roll must be prepared, and furnished to the clerk, by the attorney, for the party, at
whose instance the nnal judgment is entered; except that
the clerk must attach thereto the necessary original papers,
on file. But the clerk may, at his option, make up the
entire judgment-roll.

§ 1239. The clerk must make a minute, upon the back
of each judgment-roll, filed in his office, of the time of
filing it, specifying the year, month, day, hour, and minute.

ejectment, or for dower.

3. In an action to recover a chattel, where it awards a
chattel to either party.

§ 1241. In either of the following cases, a judgment may
be enforced, by serving a certified copy thereof, upon the ‘
party against whom it is rendered, or the oiiicer or person,
who is required thereby, or by law, to obey it; and, if he §

1. Where the judgment is final, and cannot be enforced
by execution, as prescribed in the last section.

2. Where the judgment is final, and part of it cannot be
enforced by execution, as prescribed in the last section ; in
which case, the part or parts, which cannot be so enforced,

a judgment docketed as prescribed in the last section, must
furnish, to any person applying therefor, and paying the fees
allowed by law, one or more transcripts of the docket of the
judgment, attested by his signature. A county clerk, to
Whom such a transcript is presented, must, upon payment of
his fees therefor, immediately file it, and docket the judg
ment, as prescribed in the last section, in the appropriate
docket-book, kept in his oflice.

§ 1248. A clerk who omits, as soon as practicable, to
docket a judgment required to be docketed, or to furnish

damages sustained by reason of the omission.

§ 1249. A docket-book, kept by a clerk, must be kept
open, during the business hours fixed by law, for search
and examination by any person.

§ 1250. A judgment, required to be docketed, as prescribed in this article, neither affects real property or chat
tels real, nor is entitled to a preference, until the judgmentroll is filed, and the judgment docketed.

§ 1251. Except as otherwise specially prescribed by law,
a judgment, hereafter rendered, which is docketed in a
county clerk’s office, as prescribed in this article, binds,
and is a charge upon, for ten years after filing the judgment-roll, and no longer, the real property and chattels
real, in that county, which the judgment debtor has, at the
time of so docketing it, or which he acquires at any time
afterwards, and within the ten years.

§ 1252. When ten years after filing the judgment-roll
have expired, real property or a chattel real, which the
judgment debtor, or real property which a person, deriving

the property levied upon; and, if the interest levied upon is
that of an heir or devisee, specifying that fact, and the
name of the heir or devisee. The notice must be recorded

I and indexed by the clerk, as a notice of the pendency of

an action. For that purpose, the judgment debtor, or his
heir, or devisee, named in the notice, is regarded as a party
to an action. The judgment binds, and becomes a charge
upon, the right and title thus levied upon, of the judgment
debtor, or of his heir or devisee, as the case may be, only
from the time of recording and indexing the notice, and
until the execution is set aside, or returned.

§ 1253. The interest of a person, holding a contract for

A the purchase of real property, is not bound by the docketing of a judgment; and cannot be levied upon or sold, by

at the same time, a mortgage thereupon is given by the
purchaser, to secure the payment of the Whole or a part
of the purchase money, the lieu of the mortgage, upon that
real property, is superior to the lien of a previous judgment against the purchaser.

§ 1255. The time, during which a judgment creditor is
stayed, by an injunction or other order, or by the operation
of an appeal, or by express provision of law, from enforcing
a judgment, is not a part of the ten years, to which the lieu
of a judgment upon real property is limited by this article.
But this section does not extend the time of the lien, as
against a purchaser, creditor, or mortgagee in good faith.

§ 1256. Where an appeal from a judgment has been
perfected, and an undertaking has been given, sufficient to
entitle the appellant to a stay of the execution of the judgment, Without an order for that purpose, the court, in which
the judgment was recovered, may, in its discretion and upon
such terms as justice requires, make an order, upon notice
to the attorney for the respondent, and to the sureties in
the undertaking, exempting from the lien of the judgment,

as against judgment creditors, and purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, the real property or chattels real,
upon which the judgment is a lien, or a portion thereof,
specifically described in the order. If all the property, subject to the lien, is so exempted, the order must direct the
clerk, in Whose office the judgment-roll is iiled, to make an
entry, on the docket of the judgment, in each place where
it appears in the docket-book, substantially as follows:
“Lien suspended upon appeal. See order entered”; adding
the proper date. If a portion only is exempted, the order
must direct the clerk to make, in like manner, an entry,
substantially as follows: “Lien partially suspended upon
appeal. See order entered”; adding the proper date. The
clerk must, when he files the motion papers, and enters the
order, make the entry or entries in the docket-book, as
required by the order.

§ 1257. Where an order is made, as prescribed in the last section, by the supreme court or by a county court, it operates as a suspension of the lien upon property situated in
the county, Where the judgmentroll is filed, from the time
when the order is entered, and the proper entry made in
the docket-book. If the property exempted is situated in
another county, or if the order was made by a court, other
than the supreme court or a county court, the order operates
as a suspension, from the lien, when the proper entry is
made in the docket-book, kept by the clerk of that county,
as prescribed in the next section.

§ 1258. The clerk, with Whom the order is entered, must,
upon payment of his fees therefor, furnish to the party who
obtained the order, one or more transcripts, attested by his
signature, of the docket of the judgment, including the
entry made upon the docket. A county clerk, in Whose
office the judgment is docketed, must, upon payment of his
fees therefor, immediately file such a transcript; and make
an entry upon the docket of the judgment, in each place
Where it appears in his docket-book, substantially as follows: “ Lien suspended”, or, “ Lien partially suspended ”,
according to the entry upon the original docket, and also,
“ See transcript filed ”; adding the proper date.

§ 1259. At any time after a judgment, which has ceased
to be a lien, as prescribed in the last three sections, is affirmed,
or the appeal therefrom is dismissed, the lien thereof may
be restored, as follows:

1. The clerk, in whose oflice the judgment of afiirmance,
or the order dismissing the appeal, is entered, must, upon
the request of the judgment creditor, docket the judgment
anew, as it was originally docketed, but in the order of
priority of the new docket; and he must write, upon the
new docket, the words, “Lien restored by redocket”; adding the date of redocketing.

2. A transcript of the new docket must be furnished to
a county clerk, in whose ofiice an entry of the suspension
of the lien has been made, as prescribed in the last two sections; and thereupon the judgment must be docketed by
him anew, in the order of the priority of the new docket.
The clerk who so redockets the judgment, must make an
entry upon the new docket, substantially as follows: “Lien
restoi ed by redocket. See transcript filed ”; adding the date
of redocketing in his county.

The lien of the judgment is thereupon restored, for the
unexpired period thereof, as if the order had not been
made; but with like effect only, as against judgment
creditors, purchasers, and mortgagees in good faith, as if
the judgment had then been first docketed.

§ 1260. The docket of a judgment must be cancelled and
discharged by the clerk, in whose oflice the judgmentroll is filed, upon filing with hima satisfaction-piece, describ~
ing the judgment, and executed as follows:

1. Except as otherwise prescribed in the next subdivision,
the satisfaction-piece must be executed by the party, in
whose favor the judgment was rendered, or his executor or
administrator; or, if it is made within two years after the

filing of the judgment-roll, by the attorney of record of
the party. But where the authority of the attorney has been
revoked, a satisfaction by him is not conclusive, against the
person entitled to enforce the judgment, in respect to a
person, who had actual notice of the revocation, before a
payment on the judgment was made, or a purchase of property bound thereby was effected.

2. If an assignment of the judgment, executed by the
party in whose favor it was rendered, or his executor or
administrator, has been filed in the clerk’s oflice, the satisfaction-piece must be executed by the person, who appears,
from the assignment, or from the last of the subsequent
assignments, if any, so filed, showing a continuous chain of
title, to be the owner of the judgment; or by his executor
or administrator.

3. If the satisfaction-piece is executed by an attorney in
fact, in behalf of a person authorized to execute it, other
than the attorney of record, an instrument, containing a
power to acknowledge the satisfaction, must be filed with
the satisfaction-piece, unless it has been recorded, in the
proper book for recording deeds, in that or another county;
in which case, the satisfaction-piece must refer to the record,
and the clerk may, for his own indemnity, require evidence
of a record remaining in another office.

The execution of each satisfaction-piece or power of attorney must be acknowledged, before the clerk, or his
deputy, and certified by him thereupon; or it must be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a
deed to be recorded in the county where it is filed.

§ 1261. The person, entitled to enforce a judgment, must
execute, and acknowledge before the proper officer, a satisfaction-piece thereof, at the request of the judgment debtor,
or of a person interested in property bound by the judgment, upon presentation of a satisfaction-piece, and payment of the sum due upon the judgment, and the fees
allowed by law for taking the acknowledgment of a deed.

§ 1262. A person, who has heretofore executed, or hereafter executes, a Written assignment of a judgment, owned
by him, without acknowledging the execution thereof, before an oflicer authorized to take the acknowledgment of a
deed, must so acknowledge it, at the request of his assignee,
or of a subsequent assignee thereof, or of the judgment
debtor, upon presentation of the assignment, and payment
of the oi‘1icer’s fees.

§ 1263. A resident of the State, or a person having an
oflice within the State, for the regular transaction of business, in person, who becomes the owner of a judgment, by
virtue of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or of an appointment as a receiver, or trustee or assignee
of an insolvent debtor or bankrupt, may file with the clerk,
in whose office the judgment-roll is filed, a notice of the
assignment, or of his appointment, and of his ownership of
the judgment. The notice must be subscribed by him,
adding to his signature his place of residence, and also, if
he resides without the State, his ofiice address. A notice

so filed has the same force and effect, for the purposes of
this article, as if it was an assignment of the judgment.

§ 1264. VVhere an execution is returned, wholly or partly
satisfied, the clerk must make an entry of the satisfaction,
or partial satisfaction, in the docket of the judgment, upon
which it was issued. Thereupon the judgment is deemed
satisfied, to the extent of the amount returned as collected,
unless the return is vacated by the court.

§ 1265. Where an execution is returned wholly unsatistied, the clerk must immediately make, in the docket of the
judgment, upon which it was issued, an entry of the fact,
stating the time when the execution was returned.

§ 1266. A sheriff, upon being paid the full amount due
upon an execution in his hands, must immediately indorsc
thereupon a return of satisfaction tl1€I'POf. He m11st also

deliver, to the person making the payment, upon the latter’s
request, and payment of the fees allowed by law therefor,
a certified copy of the execution, and of the return of satisfaction thereupon; which may be filed with the clerk of the
same county, who must thereupon cancel and discharge the
docket of the judgment, as if the judgmentroll was filed
in his office, and the execution was returned to him, as satisfied. But this section does not exonerate the sheriff, from
his duty to return the execution, to the clerk with whom

the judgment-roll is ‘dled.

§ 1267. The clerk of a county, with whom a judgment
has been docketed, must cancel and discharge the docket
thereof, upon the filing, with him, of a certificate of the
clerk, with whom the judgment-roll is filed, showing that
the judgment has been reversed, vacated, or satisfied of
record; or the certificate of the clerk of the county, with
whom a copy of an execution, and of a return of satisfaction thereupon, have been filed, as prescribed in the last section, showing that they have been so filed, and the docket
cancelled and discharged accordingly.

§ 1268. At any time after two years have elapsed, since
a bankrupt was discharged from his debts, pursuant to the
acts of congress relating to bankruptcy, he may apply, upon

proof of his discharge, to the court in which a judgment
was rendered against him, for an order, directing the judgment to be cancelled and discharged of record. If it appears
that he has been discharged from the payment of that
judgment, an order must be made accordingly; and thereupon the clerk must cancel and discharge the docket thereof,
as if the proper satisfaction-piece of the judgment was filed.
Notice of the application, accompanied with copies of the
papers upon which it is made, must be given to the judgment creditor, unless his written consent to the granting of
the order, with satisfactory proof of the execution thereof,
and, if he is not the party in whose favor the judgment was
rendered, that he is the owner thereof, is presented to the
court, upon the application.

§ 1269. A court of record has the same power and jurisdiction, concerning the docket of its judgments, kept by a
county clerk, which it has concerning the docket, kept by
its own clerk. It may direct that such a docket be

amended; or that its judgment, there docketed, be docketed nunc pro tunc.

§ 1270. Upon the presentation, to the clerk of a court of
record, of an assignment of a judgment, entered in his office,
executed by a person entitled to satisfy the judgment, as prescribed in section 1260 of this act, and otherwise executed
as prescribed in that section, With respect to a satisfactionpiece, and upon payment of the fees, allowed by law, for
filing a transcript, and docketing a judgment thereupon, the
clerk must forthwith file the assignment in his office, and

_make, upon the docket of the judgment, an entry of the

fact, and of the day of filing: or, if he keeps a separate
book for the "entry of assignments of judgments, an entry,
referring to the page of the book, Where the filing of the
assignment is noted.

§ 1271. A transcript of a judgment, rendered, within the
State, by a court of the United States, duly certified by the
clerk of that court, may be filed With a county clerk; Who
must docket it, as if it had been rendered by the supreme
court of the State.

§ 1272. This article applies only to a judgment, wholly
or partly for a sum of money, or directing the payment of

a sum of money; and to an execution issued upon such
a judgment. ‘

1276. J udgment-roll ; docketing and enforcing the judgment.
1277. Execution, where the judgment is not all due.

§ 1273. A judgment by confession may be entered, Without action,.either for money due or to become due, or to
secure a person against contingent liability in behalf of the
defendant, or both, as prescribed in this article. A married
Woman may confess such a judgment, as if she was single.

§ 1274. A Written statement must be made, and signed
by the defendant, to the following effect:

1. It must state the sum, for which judgment may be
entered, and authorize the entry of judgment therefor.

2. If the judgment to be confessed is for money due or
to become due, it must state concisely the facts, out of Which
the debt arose; and must show, that the sum confessed therefor is justly due, or to become due.

3. If the judgment to be confessed is for the purpose of
securing the plaintiff, against a contingent liability, it must
state concisely the facts, constituting the liability; and must
show, that the sum confessed therefor does not exceed the
amount of the liability.

The statement must be verified by the oath of the defendant, to the effect, that the matters of fact therein set
forth are true.

§ 1275. At any time Within three years after the statement is verified, it may be filed with a county clerk, or
with the clerk of a superior city court, or, Where the sum,
for which judgment is confessed, does not exceed two
thousand dollars, exclusive of interest from the time of

making the statement, with the clerk of the marine court
of the city of New-York. Thereupon the clerk must enter,
in like manner as a judgment is entered in an action, a
judgment for the sum confessed, with costs, Which he must
tax, to the amount of fifteen dollars, besides disbursements
taxable in an action. If the statement is filed with a
county clerk, the judgment must be entered in the supreme
court; if it is filed With the clerk of another court, specified
in this section, the judgment must be entered in the court
of which he is clerk. But a judgment shall not be entered
upon such a statement, after the defendant’s death.

§ 1276. The clerk, immediately after entering the judgment, must attach together and file the statement, as verified, and a certified copy of the judgment, which constitute
the judgment-roll. The judgment may be docketed, and
enforced against property, in the same manner, and with the
same effect, as a judgment in an action, rendered in the same
court; and each provision of law, relating to a judgment in
an action, and the proceedings subsequent thereto, apply to
a judgment thus taken. ‘

§ 1277. Where the debt, for which the judgment is
rendered, is not all due, execution may be issued, upon the
judgment, for the collection of the sum which has become
due. The execution must be in the form prescribed by
law, for an- execution upon a judgment for the full amount
recovered; but the person, whose name is subscribed to it,
must indorse thereupon a direction to the sheriff, to collect
only the sum due, stating the amount thereof, With interest
thereon, and the costs of the judgment. Notwithstanding
the issuing and collection of such an execution, the judgment shall remain, as security for the sum or stuns to
become due, after the execution is issued. When a further sum becomes due, an execution may, in like manner,
be issued for the collection thereof; and successive executions may be issued, as further sums become due.

§ 1278. One or more joint debtors may confess a judgment for a joint debt, due or to become due. Where all
the joint debtors do not unite in the confession, the judgment must be entered and enforced against those only Who

joint debtors, upon the same demand.

1279. Controversy, how submitted without process.
1280. Papers to be filed; controversy thereupon becomes an action.

might be the subject of an action, being of full age, may
agree upon a case, containing a statement of the facts, upon

submission thereof to a court of record, which would have
jurisdiction of an action, brought for the same cause. The
case must be accompanied With the afiidavit of one of the
parties, to the effect, that the controversy is real; and that
the submission is made in good faith, for the purpose of
determining the rights of the parties. The submission must

a deed, to be recorded in the county Where it is uled.

§ 1280. The case, submission, and affidavit, must be filed
in the ofiice of the clerk of the court, to which the submission is made. If the submission is made to the supreme
court, they must be filed in the office of the county clerk,
if any, specified in the submission; if no county clerk is
so specified, they may be filed in the office of any county
clerk. The filing is a presentation of the submission ; and
thenceforth the controversy becomes an action; and each
provision of law, relating to a proceeding in an action,
applies to the subsequent proceedings therein, except as
otherwise prescribed in the next section.

§ 1281. An order of arrest, an injunction, or a Warrant
of attachment, cannot be granted in such an action: the
costs thereof are always in the discretion of the court, but
costs cannot be taxed, for any proceedings before notice of
trial: the action must be tried by the court, upon the case
alone: and the case, submission, affidavit, and a certified
copy of the judgment, and of any order or paper, necessw
rily affecting the judgment, constitute the judgment-roll.
If the action is in the supreme court, a superior city court,
or the marine court of the city of New-York, it must be
tried, and judgment rendered, at the general term. If the
statement of facts, contained in the case, is not éufiicient to
enable the court to render judgment, an order must be
made dismissing the submission, without costs to either
party; unless the court permits the parties, or, in a proper
case, their representatives, to file an additional statement,
which it may do, in its discretion, without prejudice to the
original statement.

latter event, the motion may be re-noticed for, and heard at,
the next term at which it can be made, held not less than

ten days after the day, when the nrst term was appointed
to be held.

§ 1283. A motion to set aside a final judgment, rendered
in a court of record, for error in fact, not arising upon the
trial, may be made by the party against whom it is rendered; or, if an execution has not been issued thereon,
and the judgment has not been wholly or partly satisfied or
enforced, by the party in whose favor it is rendered.

§ 1284. A like motion may be made, after the death of
a party entitled to make it, as prescribed in the last section,

by the following persons :

property, in which the person making the motion has an
estate, or interest, in reversion or remainder.

§ 1286. Where two or more persons are entitled to move
to set aside a judgment, as prescribed in the last three sections, one or more of them may move separately; but, in
that case, notice of the motion must be given to those who

do not join therein, in like manner as if they were adverse
parties.

§ 1287. Notice of a motion to set aside a final judgment,
for error in fact, not arising upon the trial, must be given
to the adverse party, or, in case of his death, to each person who might have moved, as against the moving party,

in this title. Where the motion is made by the party
against whom the judgment is rendered, or by his heir,
devisee, executor, or administrator, service of the notice,

the judgment is rendered, has the like effect, as if it was

In such a case, an undertaking required to perfect the appeal,
or to stay the execution of the judgment or order appealed
from, must recite the fact of the adverse party’s death;

appeal is heard, if an order, substituting another person in
his place, is not made, Within three months after his death,
the court, in which the appeal is pending, may, in its discretion, make an order, requiring all persons interested in the
decedent’s estate, to show cause before it, Why the judgment or order appealed from should not be reversed or
aflirmed, or the appeal dismissed, as the case requires. The
order must specifya day, when cause is to be shown, which
must be not less than six months after making the order;
and it must designate the mode of giving notice to the persons interested. Upon the return day of the order, or at a
subsequent day, appointed by the court, if the proper person has not been substituted, the court, upon proof, by affidavit, that notice has been given, as required by the order,
may reverse or affirm the judgment or order appealed from,
or dismiss the appeal, or make such further order in the
premises, as justice requires.

intermediate order, to be reviewed.

§ 1302. If the attorney for the adverse party is dead;
or if h.e has been removed, and notice of the removal has
been served upon the appellant’s attorney, and another attorney has not been substituted in his place; or if, for any
reason, service of a notice of appeal, upon the proper attorney for the adverse party, cannot, with due diligence, be
made Within the State, the notice of appeal may be served

upon the respondent, in the manner prescribed by law for
serving it upon an attorney. If personal service upon the
respondent cannot, with due diligence, be so made Within
the State, the notice of appeal may be served, upon him,
and notice of the subsequent proceedings may be given to

him, as directed by a judge of the court, in or to Which the
appeal is taken.

§ 1303. Where the appellant, seasonably and in good
faith, serves the notice of appeal, either upon the clerk or
upon the adverse party, or his attorney, but omits, through
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, to serve it

upon the other, or to do any other act, necessary to perfect
the appeal, or to stay the execution of the judgment or
order appealed from; the court, in or to which the appeal
is taken, upon proof, by affidavit, of the facts, may, in its
discretion, permit the omission to be supplied, or an amendment to be made, upon such terms as justice requires.

§ 1304. An appeal cannot be taken from an order made
by a judge, out of court, until it is entered in the onice of
the proper clerk. Where such an order has not been so
entered, or the papers, upon which it was founded, have
not been filed in the same clerk’s ofhce, the judge Who
made it, or, if he is absent, or unable or disqualified to act,
a judge of the court, in or to which an appeal therefrom
may be taken, must, upon the application of a party or other
person, entitled to take such an appeal, make an order, requiring the omission to be supplied, Within a specified time
after service of a copy of the order made by him. Upon
proof, by affidavit, that a copy of the latter order has been
served, and that the omission has not been supplied, the
same judge may make, upon notice, an order revoking and
annulling the original order. The provisions of the last section but one apply to the service of an order, or a notice,
as prescribed in this section.

With the clerk, with Whom the judgment or order appealed
from is entered, a sum of money, equal to the amount, for
Which the undertaking is required to be given. The deposit has the same elfect, as filing the undertaking; and
notice that it has been made, has the same effect, as notice
of the filing and service of a copy of the undertaking.

The court, wherein the appeal is pending, may direct the

mode, in which the money shall be kept and disposed of,
during the pendency, or after the determination of the

appeal.

§ 1307. An undertaking, given as prescribed in this chapter, must be filed with the clerk, with whom the judg-g

satisfactory proof, by afhdavit, that since the execution of;
an undertaking, given as prescribed in this chapter, one or?

more of the sureties therein have become insolvent; or that
his or their circumstances have become so precarious, that
there is reason to apprehend, that the undertaking is not
sufricient for the security of the respondent; may make an
order, requiring the appellant to file a new undertaking,
and to serve a copy thereof, as required with respect to
the original undertaking. If the appellant fails so to do,
within twenty days after the service of a copy of the
order, or such further time as the court allows, the appeal
must be dismissed, or the order or judgment, from which

the appeal is taken, must‘ be executed, as if the original
undertaking had not been given.

§ 1309. An action shall not be maintained, upon an

undertaking, given upon an appeal, taken as prescribed in title third, fourth or fifth of this chapter, until ten days
have expired, since the service, upon the attorney for the
appellant, of a written notice of the entry of a judgment
or order, afiirming the judgment or order appealed from, or
dismissing the appeal. Where an appeal to the court of
appeals, from that judgment or order, is perfected, and
security is given thereupon, to stay the execution of the
judgment or order appealed from, an action shall not be
maintained upon the undertaking, given upon the preceding appeal, until after the final determination of the
appeal to the court of appeals.

§ 1310. Where an appeal has been perfected, as prescribed in this chapter, and the other acts, if any, required
to be done, to stay the execution of the judgment or order
appealed from, have been done, the appeal stays all proceedings to enforce the judgment or order appealed from; except
that the court or judge, from Whose determination the appeal
is taken, may proceed in any matter, included in the action
or special proceeding, and not affected by the judgment or
order appealed from, or not embraced Within the appeal;
or may cause perishable property to be sold, pursuant to
the judgment or order appealed from. The proceeds of
such a sale must be paid, to abide the result of the appeal,
into the court, from or in which the appeal is taken; or, if
it Was taken as prescribed in title dfth of this chapter, into
the supreme court.

§ 1311. Where an appeal, taken, from a final judgment,
to the court of appeals, has been perfected, and the security,
required to stay the execution of the judgment, has been
given ; or where the security, given upon an appeal, taken
from a final judgment of the supreme court, a superior city
court, a county court, or the marine court of the city of
N ew-York, is equal to that required to perfect an appeal
to the court of appeals, and to stay the execution of the
judgment ; the court, in which the judgment appealed from
was rendered, may, in its discretion, and upon such terms
as justice requires, make an order, upon notice to the respondent, and the sureties in the undertaking, discharging a
levy upon personal property, made by virtue of an execution, issued upon the judgment appealed from. But this section does not authorize the discharge of a levy, made by
virtue of a warrant of attachment.

§ 1312. Where an appeal is taken, as prescribed in title
second or fourth of this chapter, the court, in or from which
the appeal is taken; or, Where an appeal is taken as prescribed in title third or fifth of this chapter, the court-, to

which the appeal is taken; may, in its discretion, make an

order, upon notice to the respondent, dispensing with o1
limiting the security, required to stay the execution of the
judgment or order appealed from, as follows:

1. Where the appellant is an executor, administrator,
trustee, or other person acting in another’s right, the security
may be dispensed with or limited, in the discretion of the
court.

than fifty thousand dollars, where it would otherwise exceed
that sum.

§ 1313. Upon an appeal, taken by the people of the
State, or by a State ofhcer, or board of State officers, the
service of the notice of appeal perfects the appeal, and
stays the execution of the judgment or order appealed from,
without an undertaking, or other security.

§ 1314. Upon an appeal, taken by a municipal corporation, the service of the notice of appeal perfects the appeal,
and stays the execution of the judgment or order appealed
from, without an undertaking, or other security; except
that, where an appeal is taken, as prescribed in title second, third or fourth of this chapter, the court, in or from
which the appeal is taken, may, in its discretion, require
security to be given. In that case, the form, nature, and
extent of the security, not exceeding that which is required
in a like case, from a natural person, and the time and
manner in which it must be given, must be prescribed by
the order of the court; and the mayor, comptroller, or

counsel to the corporation, may execute, in behalf of the
corporation, an undertaking, so required to be given.

§ 1315. Where an appeal is taken from a final judgment, }
as prescribed in title second or third of this chapter, the:

appellant must, within twenty days after it is perfected,<
cause a certified copy of the notice of appeal, of the judgment-roll, and of a case or notice of exceptions, if any, filed

after the entry of judgment, to. be transmitted to the appellate court, by the clerk, upon whom the notice of appeal was
served. Where an appeal from an order, or a part of an
order, is taken as prescribed in title second, third, or fifth of

this chapter, the appellant must, within the same time,
cause a certified copy of the notice of appeal, of the order,
and of the papers upon which the order was founded, to
be transmitted to the appellate court, by the same clerk. If
the appellant fails so to do, the respondent may cause those
papers to be so transmitted; and he is entitled to tax the
expense thereof, as a disbursement, where he recovers costs.
The clerk of the appellate court must file the papers so
transmitted; and, except where it is otherwise specially
prescribed by law, the appeal must be heard upon them.

§ 1316. An appeal, taken from a final judgment, brings
up for review, an interlocutory judgment, or an intermediate order, which is specified in the notice of appeal, and
necessarily affects the final judgment; and which has not
already been reviewed, upon a separate appeal therefrom,
by the court or the term of the court, to which the appeal
from the final judgment is taken. The right to review an
interlocutory judgment, or an intermediate order, as prescribed in this section, is not affected by the expiration of
the time, within which a separate appeal therefrom might
have been taken.

§ 1317. Upon an appeal from a judgment or an order, the
court, or the general term, to which the appeal is taken, may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify, the judgment or order appealed from, and each interlocutory judgment or intermediate order, which it is authorized to review,
as specified in the notice of appeal, and as to any or all of the
parties; and it may, if necessary or proper, grant a new
trial or hearing. A judgment, affirming wholly or partly a
judgment, from which an appeal has been taken, shall not,
expressly and in terms, award to the respondent, a sum of
money, or other relief, which was awarded to him by the

judgment so afhrmed.

§ 1318. Where a judgment, from which an appeal is taken,
is reversed upon the appeal, and a new trial is granted, an
appeal cannot be taken from the judgment of reversal; but
upon an appeal from the order granting a new trial, taken,
as prescribed by law, the judgment of reversal must also
be reviewed.

§ 1319. Where a judgment, from which an appeal has:
been taken, from one court to another, is wholly or partly:
aliirmed, or is modified, upon the appeal, it must beenforced,
by the court in which it was rendered, to the extent per- i
mitted by the determination of the appellate court, as if
the appeal therefrom had not been taken.

§ 1320. Where a fmal order, from which an appeal has:
been taken, fron1 one court to another, as prescribed in title‘
fifth of this chapter, is wholly or partly afhrmed, or is modiiied, upon the appeal, the appellate court may enforce its
order, or may direct the proceedings to be remitted, for
that purpose, to the court below, or to the judge who made
the order appealed from. ’

§ 1321. Where a final judgment for a sum of money, or:
directing the payment of a sum of money, has .been re-1
versed, or has been affirmed as to part only of the sum,i
upon an appeal, taken as prescribed in title third or fourthi
of this chapter; if an appeal to the court of appeals is not
taken and perfected, and the security required to stay
execution is not given, within ten days after the entry of
the judgment upon the appeal, in the clerk’s ofhce where
the judgment appealed from is entered, the clerk must
make a minute of the reversal of the judgment, or of the
amount to which it has been reduced, upon his docketbook, in each place, where the judgment is docketed. A
transcript of the docket, as thus corrected, must be furnished by him, and may be filed in any county clerk’s
office, where the original judgment is docketed, as prescribed by law, with respect to the original docket; and

thereupon the county clerk must correct his docket accordingly. The lien of a udgment, the docket of Which is not
corrected, as prescribed in this section, remains unaifected
by the reversal or modiiication thereof’, until the decision
of the court of appeals, upon an appeal from the judgment reversing or modifying the same, or the expiration of
the time to take such an appeal.

§ 1322. Where a final judgment for a sum of money,
or directing the payment of a sum of money, has been
reversed, or anirmed as to part only of the sum, upon
an appeal to the court of appeals, the docket may be
corrected, as prescribed in the last section, at any time
after the remittitur has been filed in the court below.

§ 1323. Where a final judgment or order is reversed or
modified, upon appeal, the appellate court, or the general
term of the same court, as the case may be, may make or
compel restitution of property or of a right, lost by means
of the erroneous judgment or order; but not so as ‘to affect
the title of a purchaser, in good faith and for value, of
property sold, pursuant to a direction contained in the
judgment, or by virtue of an execution issued thereupon.
In the latter case, it may compel the value, or the purchase
price, to be restored, or deposited to abide the event of the
action, as justice requires.

of the court below, and the judgment-roll filed. An appeal
to the court of appeals, from an order, must be taken within
sixty days after’ service, upon the attorney for the appellant,
of a copy of the order appealed from, and a written notice
of the entry thereof.

§ 1326. To render a notice of appeal, to the court of
appeals, eifectual, for any purpose, except in a case where
it is specially prescribed by law, that security is not necessary, to perfect the appeal, the appellant must give a written undertaking, to the effect, that he Will pay all costs and
damages, which may be awarded against him on the appeal,
not exceeding five hundred dollars. The appeal is perfected, when such an undertaking is given and a copy

thereof, with notice of the filing thereof, is served, as prescribed in this title.

§ 1327. If the appeal is taken from a judgment for a
sum of money, or from a judgment or order, directing
the payment of a sum of money, it does not stay the
execution of the judgment or order, until the appellant
gives a written undertaking, to the eifect, that if the judgment or order appealed from, or any part thereof, is
afiirmed, or the appeal is dismissed, he will pay the sum,
recovered or directed to be paid, by the judgment or order,

that the appellant Will pay each instalment, which becomes
payable, pending the appeal, or the part thereof as to which
the judgment or order is aflirmed, not exceeding a sum

time afterwards, upon satisfactory proof, by affidavit, that
the sum so fixed is insufficient in amount, make an order,
requiring the appellant to give a further undertaking, to the
same effect, in a sum and within a time, speciiied in the order.
A failure to comply with such an order has the same effect,
as if no undertaking had been given, as prescribed in this section.

§ 1328. If the appeal is taken from a judgment or order,
directing the assignment or delivery of ' a document, or of
personal property, it does not stay the execution of the
judgment or order, until the thing directed to be assigned
or delivered, is brought into the court below, or placed in
the custody of an officer or receiver, designated by that
court; or the appellant gives a written undertaking as prescribed in the next section.

§ 1329. If the appeal is taken from a judgment for the

recovery of a chattel, it does not stay the execution of

the judgment, until the appellant gives a written undertaking, in a sum fixed by the court below, or a judge
thereof, to the effect, that the appellant will obey the direction of the appellate court, upon the appeal.

§ 1330. If the appeal is taken from a judgment or order,
directing the execution of a conveyance, or other instrument, it does not stay the execution of the judgment or
order, until the instrument is executed, and deposited with
the clerk, with whom the judgment or order is entered, to
abide the direction of the appellate court.

§ 1331. If the appeal is taken from a judgment, which
entitles the respondent to the immediate possession of real
property, or from a judgment or order, directing the sale or
the delivery of possession of real property, it does not stay
the execution of the judgment or order, until the appellant
gives a written undertaking, to the elfect that he will not,
while in possession of the property, commit, or suifer to be
committed, any waste thereon; and that, if the judgment
or order is aiiirmed, or the appeal is dismissed, he will pay
the value of the use and occupation of the property, or the
part thereof, as to which the judgment or order is affirmed,
from the time of taking the appeal, until the delivery of
the possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment or order,
not exceeding a specified sum, fixed by a judge of the court
below. Where the judgment is for a sale of mortgaged
premises, and the payment of a deficiency, the undertaking
must also provide for the payment of the deficiency.

§ 1332. Where the judgment or order, from which an
appeal is taken to the court of appeals, afhrms a judgment
or order, to the effect specified in either of the last live sections, the undertaking must be the same, as if the judgment or order, from which the appeal is so taken, was to
the same eifect, as the judgment or order so affirmed.

§ 1333. The last six sections do not extend to a case,
where it is specially prescribed by law, that an appeal may
be taken, or the execution of a judgment or order appealed
from may he stayed, without security, or where the security
to be given, for either purpose, is specially regulated by
law.

§ 1334. Where two or more undertakings are required to
be given, as prescribed in this title, they may be contained in
the same instrument, or in different instruments, at the option
of the appellant. Each undertaking, given as prescribed in 5
this title, must be executed by at least two sureties ; must‘

be approved by a judge of the court below; and must
specify the residence of each surety therein. A copy
thereof, with a notice showing where it is filed, must be
served on the attorney for the adverse party, with the notice
of appeal, or before the expiration of the time to appeal.

§ 1335. The "attorney for the respondent may, within ten
days after service of a copy of the undertaking, with notice
of the filing thereof, serve upon the attorney for the appellant, a written notice, that he excepts to the sufficiency of the
sureties. Within ten days thereafter, the sureties, or other
sureties in a new undertaking, to the same effect, must 
tify, before a judge of the court below, or a county judge.
At least five days’ notice of the justilication must be given;
in every other respect, the provisions of sections 578, 579
and 580 of this act apply to the justification. If the judge
finds the sureties suflicient, he must indorse his allowance
of them, upon the undertaking, or a copy thereof; and a
notice of the allowance must be served upon the attorney
for the exceptant. The effect of a failure so to justify, and
to procure an allowance, is the same, as if the undertaking

had not been given.

§ 1336. Where final judgment is rendered in the court
below, after the aifirmance, upon an appeal to the general
term of that court, of an interlocutory judgment; or after
the refusal, by the general term, of a new trial, either upon
an application, made, in the hrst instance, at the general
term, or upon an appeal from an order of the special term,
or of the judge before whom the issues, or questions of fact,
were tried by a jury ; the party aggrieved may appeal
directly from the final judgment to the court of appeals,
notwithstanding that it was rendered at a special term, or
at a trial term, or pursuant to the directions, contained in a
referee’s report. But such an appeal brings up, for review,
only the determination of the general term, ailirming the
interlocutory judgment, or refusing the new trial

§ 1337. An appeal to the court of appeals from a final
judgment, or from an order, granting or refusing a new trial
in an action, or from a final order affecting a substantial
right, made, either in a special proceeding, or upon a summary application after judgment in an action, brings up for
review, in that court, every question, affecting a substantial
right, and not resting in discretion, which was determined
by the general term of the court below, in rendering the
judgment or making the order, from which the appeal is
taken; except that a question of fact, arising upon conflict
ing evidence, cannot be determined upon such an appeal,
unless where special provision for the determination thereof
is made by law.

§ 1338. Upon an appeal to the court of appeals from a
judgment, reversing a judgment entered upon a referee’s§
report, or _a decision of the court, upon a trial without a‘
jury; or from an order granting a new trial, upon such a
reversal; it must be presumed, that the judgment was not
reversed, or the new trial granted, upon a question of fact,
unless the contrary clearly appears, in the body of the judgment or order appealed from, In that case, the court of
appeals must review the determination of the general term
of the court below, upon the questions of fact, as well as
the questions of law

§ 1339. Where an appeal to the court of appeals, from;
a judgment, rendered at a general term of the court 3
below, upon a verdict, subject to the opinion of the court, 1
has been perfected, a case, containing a concise state- I
ment of the facts, of the questions of law arising thereupon,
and of the determination of those questions by the general
term, must be prepared and settled, by or under the direction
of the court below, and annexed to the judgment-roll. An
exception is not necessary, to enable the court of appeals to
review the determination of a question of law, arising upon
the verdict. A certiiied copy of the case must be transmitted to the court of appeals, instead of the case, upon which
the judgment of the court below was rendered. The court
below, or a judge thereof, may extend the time, limited by
law, Within which the papers_ must be transmitted to the
court of appeals, for the purpose of enabling the appellant
to procure the case to be prepared or settled.

appeal to the court of appeals, from a judgment of the same
amount, or to the same eifect.

court, from an order, aifecting a substantial right, made by

§ 1343. An appeal, authorized by the last section, must

be taken, within thirty days after service upon the attorney for the appellant, of a copy of the order, and Written
notice of the entry thereof. Security is not required to perfect it; but it does not stay the execution of the order
from which it is taken. The appellate court, or a judge

thereof, may direct such a stay, upon such terms, as to
security or otherwise, as justice requires.

§ 1344. An appeal, taken as prescribed in this title, must
be heard at the general term. The provisions of title

made upon such an appeal, must be entered, and the papers,
upon which the appeal was heard, must be filed, in the office
of the same clerk. The ‘dling of the judgment-roll, or the
entry of the order, as prescribed in this section, is a sufficient
authority for any proceeding in the court below, or before
the judge, who made the order appealed from, which the
judgment or order of the appellate court directs or permits.
But Where the execution of the judgment or order of the
appellate court is stayed, by an appeal to the court of
appeals, the proceedings in the court below, or before the

as prescribed in this title, the appellant may give the
security, required to perfect an appeal to the court of
appeals, from a judgment of the same amount, or to the

ofhce of the clerk of the county, Where the judgment or
order appealed from is entered. If the appeal is determined at a general term, held in another county, the clerk
of that county must, at the expense of the successful party,

§ 1362. An execution must be directed to the sheriff,
unless he is a pa.rty or interested; in which case it must be
directed as prescribed in section 17 3 of this act. But the
court may, in its discretion, order an execution, issued upon
a judgment rendered against a sheriff, either alone or with
another, to be directed to a person, designated in the order,
instead of to the coroners, or a particular coroner; in which
case it must be so directed. The person so designated must

be of full age, a resident of the State, and not a party to
the action, or interested therein. Where the execution is
issued upon a judgment for a sum of money, or directing
the payment of a sum of money, the order does not take
effect, until the person so designated executes, and files in
the clerk’s oflice, a bond to the people, with at_ least two
sureties, approved by a judge of the court, or a county
judge, in a penal sum, fixed by the order, not less than
twice the sum to be collected by virtue of the execution;
conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties under
the execution. A certified copy of the order, and, where it
requires a bond to be given, the clerk’s certificate that a
bond has been filed, as required by the order, must be
attached to the execution. The person so designated is
deemed an officer; and, with respect to that execution, he
is subject to the obligations and liabilities, and has the

power and authority of a coroner, and is entitled to fees
accordingly.

§ 1363. The sheriff, to whom an execution is directed
and delivered, must, upon the receipt thereof, indorse thereupon a memorandum of the year, month, day, and hour of
the day, when he received it.

§ 1364. There are four kinds of execution, as follows:

1. Against property.

2. Against the person.

3. For the delivery of the possession of real property,
with or without damages for withholding the same.

4. For the delivery of the possession of a chattel, with
or Without damages for the taking or detention thereof.

An execution is the process of the court, from which it
is issued.

§ 1365. An execution against property can be issued
only to a county, in the clerk’s ofiice of which the judgment is docketed. An execution against the person may
be issued to any county. An execution for the delivery of
the possession of real property, must be issued to the county,
Where the property, or a part thereof, is situated. An execution for the delivery of the possession of a chattel, may
be issued to any county, Where the chattel is found ; or to
the sheriff of the county Where the judgmentroll is filed.
Executions, upon the same judgment, may be issued at the
same time, to two or more different counties.

§ 1366. An execution” must intelligibly describe the
judgment, stating the names of the pa.rties in Whose favor,
and against Whom, the time When, and the court in Which,
the judgment was rendered; and, if it was rendered in the
supreme court, the county in which the judgment-roll is
iiled. It must require the sheriff to return it to the proper
clerk, Within sixty days after the receipt thereof-. Except
as otherwise prescribed in the next section, it must be
made returnable to the clerk, with Whom the j udgment-roll

is filed.

§ 1367. Where an execution is issued out of a court,
other than that in which the judgment was rendered, upon
filing a transcript of the judgment rendered in the latter
court, it must also specify the clerk, With Whom the transcript is liled, and the time of filing; and it must be made
returnable to that clerk. If the judgment was rendered
in a justice’s court, it must specify the justice’s name ; and
it must omit the specification, respecting the filing of the
j udgment-roll.

§ 1368. An execution, issued upon a judgment for asum
of money, or directing the payment of a sum of money,

must specify, in the body thereof, the sum recovered, or
directed to be paid, and the sum actually due when it is
issued. It may specify a day, from which interest upon
the sum due is to be computed ; in which case, the sheriff must
collect interest accordingly, until the sum is paid. If all
the parties, against whom the udgment is rendered, are

not judgment debtors, the execution must show who is the
judgment debtor.

§ 1369. An execution against property must, if the judgment-roll is not med in the clerk’s office of the county to
which it is issued, specify the time when the judgment was
docketed in that county. It must, except in a case where
special provision is otherwise made by law, substantially
require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, out of the personal property of the judgment debtor; and, if sufiicient
personal property cannot be found, out of the real property,
belonging to him, at the time when the judgment was docketed in the clerk’s oflice of the county, or at any time thereafter.

§ 1370. Where a warrant of attachment, issued in the ,
action, has been levied, the execution must substantially ;

require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, as follows:

1. Where the judgment debtor is a non-resident, or a for- i

eign corporation, and the summons was served upon him
or it, Without the State, or otherwise than personally, pursuant to an order obtained for that purpose, as prescribed
in chapter fifth of this act, and the judgment debtor has

not appeared in the action; out of the personal property
attached, and, if that is insufficient, out of the real property
attached.

2. In any other case, out of the personal property attached; and, if that is insufficient, out of the other personal
property of the judgment debtor; if both are insufficient,

out of the real property attached; and, if that is insufiicient,
out of the real property, belonging to him, at the time when
the judgment was docketed in the clerk’s office of the
county, or at any time thereafter.

§ 1371. An execution against real or personal property,
in the hands of an executor, administrator, heir, devisee,

legatee, tenant of real property, or trustee, must substantially require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, out of that

property.

§ 1372. An execution against the person must substantially require the sheriff, to arrest the judgment debtor, and
commit him to the jail of the county, until he pays the
judgment, or is discharged according to law. Except where
it may be issued, without the previous issuing and return
of an execution against property, it must recite the issuing

and return of such an execution, specifying the county to
which it was issued.

§ 1373. An execution for the delivery of the possession
of real property, or a chattel, must particularly describe the
property, and designate the party to whom the judgment
awards the possession thereof; and it must substantially
require the sheriff, to deliver the possession of the property,
within his county, to the party entitled thereto. If a sum of
money is awarded by the same judgment, it maybe collected,
by virtue of the same execution; or a separate execution
may be issued for the collection thereof, omitting the direction to deliver possession of the property. If one execution
is issued for both purposes, it must contain, with respect
to the money to be collected, the same directions as an execution against property, or against the person, as the case
requires.

§ 1374. Where a judgment awards different sums of
money, to or against different parties, a separate execution

may be issued, to collect each sum so awarded; subject to
the power of the court, to control the enforcement of the
executions, upon motion, where the collection of one execution will, wholly or partly, satisfy another.

§ 1375. Except as otherwise specially prescribed by law,
the party recovering a. final judgment, or his assignee, may
have execution thereupon, of course, at any time within
live years after the entry of the judgment.‘

§ 1376. Where the party, recovering a final judgment, has
died, and the execution is issued in behalf of an assignee,
a statement of that fact, containing the name and residence
of the assignee, must be indorsed upon the execution. In
any other case, the court may, by order, permit the personal representative, heir, or devisee of the decedent, as the
case requires, to have execution upon the judgment, within
five years after the entry thereof. The execution must be
in the same form, as if the party recovering the judgment
was living, except that the substance of the order must be

recited, in an indorsement thereupon.

§ 1377. After the lapse of five years from the entry of a
final judgment, execution can be issued thereupon, in one of
the following cases only: A

1.’ Where an execution was issued thereupon, within iive '
years after the entry of the judgment, and has been returned

wholly or partly unsatisfied.
2. Where an order is made by the court, granting leave
to issue the execution.

§ 1378. Notice of an application for an order, granting;
leave to issue an execution, as prescribed in the last section, 
must be served personally upon the adverse party, if he is a
resident of the State, and personal service can, with reasonable diligence, be made upon him therein; otherwise, notice
must be given in such manner as the court directs. Where

- the judgment is for a sum of money, or directs the payment
of a sum of money, leave shall not be granted, except on
proof, by ailidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, that the

judgment remains wholly or partly unsatisfied.

§ 1379. An execution to collect a sum of money cannot
be issued, against the property of a judgment debtor, who
has died since the entry of the judgment, except as prescribed in the next two sections.

§ 1380. After the expiration of one year from the death
of a party, against whom a final judgment for a sum of
money, or directing the payment of a sum of money, is rendered, the judgment may be enforced by execution, against
any property upon which it is a lien, with like effect as if
the judgment debtor was still living. But such an execution shall not be issued, unless an order, granting leave to
issue it, is procured from the court, from which the execution is to be issued, and a decree, to the same effect, is procured from a surrogate’s court of the State, which has
duly granted letters testamentary or letters of administration, upon the estate of the deceased judgment debtor.

§ 1381. Leave to issue an execution, as prescribed in the
last section, must be procured as follows :

1. Notice of the application, to the court, from which the
execution is to be issued, for an order, granting leave to issue
the execution, must be given to the person or persons, whose
interest in the property will be affected by a sale by virtue of
the execution, and also to the executor or administrator of the
judgment debtor. The general rules of practice may prescribe the manner in which the notice must be given; until
provision is so made therein, it must be served, either
personally, or in such a manner as the court prescribes, in
an order to show cause. Leave shall not be granted, except
upon proof, by aiiidavit, to the satisfaction of the court,
that the judgment remains wholly or partly unsatisfied.

2. For the purpose of procuring a decree from the surro- 1

gate’s court, granting leave to issue the execution, the judgment creditor must present to that court, a written petition,
duly verified, setting forth the facts, and praying for such
a decree; and that the persons, specified in the first subdivision of this section, may be cited, to show cause why it
should not be granted. Upon the presentation of such a
petition, the surrogate must issue a citation accordingly ;
and, upon the return thereof, he must make such a decree in
the premises, as justice requires.

§ 1382. The time during which the person, entitled to
enforce a judgment, is stayed from enforcing it, by the provision of a statute, or by an injunction or other order, or in
consequence of an appeal, is not a part of the time, limited
by this title, for issuing an execution thereupon, or for

making an application for leave to’ issue such an execution.

§ 1383. The last six sections do not affect the right of a
judgment creditor to enforce a udgment, against the property of one or more surviving judgment debtors, as if all
the judgment debtors were living. In that case, an execution must be issued in the usual form; but the attorney
for the judgment creditor must indorse thereupon, a notice
to the sheriff, reciting the death of the deceased judgment
debtor, and requiring the sheriff not to collect the execution,
out of any property which belonged to him.

§ 1384. A sale of real or personal property, by virtue of
an execution, or pursuant to the directions contained in a
judgment or order, must be made at public auction, between
the hour of nine o’clock in the..morning and sunset.

§ 1385. A person who, before the time fixed for the sale,
in a notice of the sale of property, to be made by virtue
of an execution, wilfully takes down or defaces such a

notice put up by the sheriff, or by his authority, forfeits
iifty dollars to the judgment creditor, and the same sum to
the judgment debtor; unless the notice was defaced or taken
down, with the consent of the person seeking to enforce
the forfeiture, or the execution was previously satisfied.

§ 1386. An omission by the sheriff to give notice, as
required by law, or the taking down or defacing of a notice,
when put up, does not affect the validity of a sale, made by
virtue of an execution, to a purchaser in good faith, without notice of the omission or offence.

§ 1387. The sheriff, to Whom an execution is directed, or

the under-sheriff or deputy-sheriff, holding an execution,

and conducting a sale of property by virtue thereof, shall
not, directly or indirectly, purchase any of the property at
the sale. A purchase made by him, or to his use, is void.

§ 1388. Where the sheriff, to Whom an execution is delivA ered, dies, is removed from office, or becomes otherwise disqualified to act, before thelexecution is returned, his undersheriff must proceed upon the execution, as the sheriff
might have done. If there is no under-sheriE, the court,
from which the execution issued, may designate a person
to proceed thereupon; who may complete the same, as an
under-sheriff might have done. The person so designated
must give such security as the court directs. He is deemed
an oilicer; and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities, and has the same power and authority-, in relation
to the object of his appointment, as a sheriff, and is entitled
to fees accordingly. But this section does not apply, in a
case where special provision is otherwise made by law, for
the enforcement of an execution, after the death, removal

from oflice, or other disqualification, of the sheriff, or undersheriff.

purpose.

2. It must not exceed in extent one-fourth of an acre.

3. It must not contain, at the time of its designation, or

at any time afterwards, any building or structure, except
one or more vaults, or other places of deposit for the dead,

or mortuary monuments.

§ 1396. In order to designate land, to be exempted as
prescribed in the last section, a notice, containing a full
description of the land to be exempted, and stating that it
has been set apart for a family or private burying ground,
must be subscribed by the owner; acknowledged or proved,
and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the
county where the land is situated; and recorded in the
oflice of the clerk or register of that county, in the proper
book for recording deeds, at least three days before the sale
of the land, by virtue of the execution. '

§ 1397. A lot of land, with one or more buildings thereon,
not exceeding in value one thousand dollars, owned, and
occupied as a residence, by a householder having a family,
and heretofore designated as an exempt homestead, as prescribed bylaw, or hereafter designated for that purpose,
as prescribed in the next section, is exempt from sale, by
virtue of an‘ execution, issued upon a judgment, recovered
for a debt contracted after the thirtieth day of April, eighteen hundred and fifty; unless the judgment was recovered
wholly for a debt or debts, contracted before the designation
of the property, or for the purchase-money thereof.

§ 1398. In order to designate property, to be exempted
as prescribed in the last section, a conveyance thereof, stating, in substance, that it is designed to be held as a homestead, exempt from sale by virtue of an execution, must be
recorded, as prescribed by law; or a notice, containing a
full description of the property, and stating that it is
designed to be so held, must be subscribed by the owner,
acknowledged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a

deed to }pe recorded in the county where the property is
situated; and must be recorded by the clerk of that county,
in a book, kept by the clerk for that purpose, and styled

“Homestead Exemption Book.”

§ 1399. "A. lot of land, with one or more buildings thereon,
owned by a married woman, and occupied by her as a residence, may be designated as her exempt homestead, as prescribed in the last section ; and the property so designated
is exempt from sale, by virtue of an execution, under the
same circumstances, and subject to the same exceptions, as
the lfomestead of a householder, having a family.

§ 1400. The exemption, prescribed by the last three sections, continues, after the death of the person in whose
favor the property was exempted, as follows:

1. If the decedent was a woman, it continues, for the
benefit of her surviving children, until the majority of the
youngest surviving child.

2. If the decedent was a man, it continues, for the benefit
of his widow and surviving children, until the majority of
the youngest surviving child, and until the death of the
widow.

But the exemption ceases earlier, if the property ceases
to be occupied, as a residence, by a person for whose benefit it may so continue, except as otherwise prescribed in the
next section.

§ 1401. The right to exemption, of a person entitled
thereto, as prescribed in the last four sections, is not
affected by a suspension of the occupation of the exempt
property, as a residence, for a period not exceeding one year,
which occurs in consequence of injury to, or destruction of,
the dwelling house upon the premises.

§ 1402. The exemption of a homestead, otherwise valid
under the provisions of this article, is not void, because the
value of the property, designated as exempt, exceeds one
thousand dollars. In that case, the lien of a judgment
attaches to the surplus, as if the property had not been
designated as an exempt homestead; but the property cannot be sold by virtue of an execution, issued upon a judgment, as against which it is exempt. After the return of
such an execution, the owner of the judgment may maintain
a judgment creditor’s action, to procure a judgment, directing a sale of the property, and enforcing his lien upon the
surplus.

§ 1403. Where the judgment, in a judgment cre<£tor’s

action, brought as prescribed in the last section, or in any
other action affecting the title to an exempt homestead,

directs the sale of the property, the court must so marshal’

the proceeds of the sale, that the right and interest of each
person in the proceeds, shall correspond, as nearly as may
be, to his right and interest in the property sold. Money,
not exceeding one thousand dollars, paid to a judgment
debtor, as representing his interest in the proceeds, is
exempt for one year after the payment, as the property sold
was exempt; unless, before the expiration of the year, he
can see real property to be designated as an exempt homestead,
as prescribed in section 1398 of this act; in which case, the
exemption ceases, with respect to so much of the money, as
was not expended for the purchase of that property; and the
exemption of the property so designated extends to every
debt, against which the property sold was exempt. Where
the exemption of property, sold as prescribed in this section, has been continued after the judgment debtor’s death,
or where he dies after the sale,.and before payment to him
of his proportion of the proceeds of the sale, the court may
direct that portion of the proceeds, which represents his
interest, to be invested, for the benefit of the person or persons, entitled to the benefit of the exemption; or to be
otherwise disposed of, as justice requires.

§ 1404. The owner of real property, exempt as prescribed
-in this article, may, at any time, subscribe a notice, and
{personally acknowledge the execution thereof, before an
officer, authorized by law to take the acknowledgment of a
deed, to the effect, that he cancels all exemptions from
levy or sale by virtue of an execution, a:Eecting the property, or a particular part thereof, fully described in the
notice. The cancellation takes effect, when such a notice is
recorded, as prescribed in this article for recording a notice
to effect the exemption so cancelled. Any other release or
Waiver, hereafter executed, of an exemption of real property,
allowed by this article, or of an exemption of a homestead,
or a private or family burying ground, allowed by the provisions of law heretofore in force, is void. A mortgage, hereafter executed, upon property so exempt, is ineffectual,
until the exemption has been cancelled, as prescribed in
this section; except that such a mortgage is valid, to the
extent of the purchase-money of the same property, secured

thereby. ,

§ 1405. The goods and chattels of a judgment debtor, ,
not exempt, by express provision of law, from ‘levy and sale"

by virtue of an execution, and his other personal property,
which is expressly declared by law, to be subject to levy by
virtue of an execution, are, when situated Within the 
diction of the oilicer, to Whom an execution against property is delivered, bound by the execution, from the time of
the delivery thereof to the proper oilicer, to be executed;
but not before.

§ 1406. Where two or more executions against property
are issued, out of the same or different courts of record,
against the same judgment debtor, the one nrst delivered,
to an oiiicer, to be executed, has preference, notwithstanding
that a levy is first made, by virtue of an execution subsequently delivered; but if a levy upon and sale of personal
property has been made, by virtue of the junior execution,
before an actual levy, by virtue of the senior execution, the
same property shall not be levied upon or sold, by virtue
of the latter.

§ 1407. Where there are one or more executions, and one
or more Warrants of attachment, against the property of the
same person, the rule prescribed in the last section prevails,
in determining the preferences of the executions or warrants
of attachment; the defendant in the Warrants of attachment
being, for that purpose, regarded as a udgment debtor.

§ 1408. But an execution, issued out of a court not of
record, or a Warrant of attachment, granted in an action
pending in a court not of record, if actually levied, has
preference over another execution, issued out of any court,
of record or not of record, which has not been previously
levied.

§ 1409. The title to personal property, acquired before
the actual levy of an execution, by a purchaser in good
faith, and Without notice that the execution has been
issued, is not affected by an execution delivered, before
the purchaseiwas made, to an oiiicer, to be executed.

§ 1410. The oiiicer, to Whom an execution against property is delivered, must levy upon current money of the
United States, belonging to the judgment debtor; and must
pay it over, as so much money collected, without exposing
it for sale; except that where it consists of gold or silver
coin, he must sell it, like other personal property; unless he
is other Wise directed, by the general rules of practice, or by
the judgment in the particular cause.

§ 1411. The oilicer, to Whom an execution against property is delivered, must levy upon and sell, a bill, or other
evidence of debt, belonging to the judgment debtor, which
Was issued by a moneyed corporation to circulate as money;
or a bond, or other instrument for the payment of money,
belonging to the judgment debtor, which was executed and
issued, with one or more interest coupons annexed, by a
government, state, county, public oiiicer, or municipal or
other corporation, and is in terms negotiable, or payable to
the bearer, or holder.

§ 1412. The interest of the judgment debtor in personal
property, subject to levy, lawfully pledged, for the payment
of money, or the performance of a contract or agreement,
may be sold, in the hands of the pledgee, by virtue of an
execution against property. The purchaser at the sale
acquires all the right and interest of the judgment debtor,
and is entitled to the possession of the property, on complying with the terms and conditions, upon which the judgment
debtor could obtain possession thereof. This section does
not apply to property, of which the judgment debtor is
unconditionally entitled to the possession.

§ 1413. Where an ofiicer has seized personal property of
a partnership, before or after its dissolution, upon a levy
upon the interest therein of a partner, made by virtue of
an execution against his individual property, the other
partners, or former partners, having an interest in the property, or any of them, may, at any time before the sale, apply
to a judge of the court, or to the county judge of the county,
where the seizure was made, upon an ailidavit, showing the
fact, for an order, directing the oflicer to release the property,
and to deliver it to the applicant.

§ 1414. Upon such an application, the applicant must

give an undertaking, with at least two sureties, approved

by the judge, to the effect, that he will account to the purchaser, upon the sale to be made by virtue of the execution,

of the interest of the judgment debtor in the property
seized, in like manner as he would be bound to account to
an assignee of such an interest; and that he will pay to the
purchaser the balance, which may be found due upon the
accounting, not exceeding a sum, specified in the undertaking, which must be not less than the value of the interest of
the judgment debtor, in the property seized by the sheriff, as
fixed by the judge. The provisions of sections 695 and 696
of this act apply to the proceedings, taken as prescribed in
this and the last section.

§ 1415. Where a warrant of attachment has been levied
upon the interest of a defendant, as a partner, in personal
6 property of a partnership, and the attachment has been discharged as to that interest, as prescribed in sections 693
and 694 of this act, a levy, by virtue of an execution against
his individual property, cannot be made upon his interest
in the same property, unless the warrant of attachment has
been vacated, or annulled.

§ 1416. Where personal property of a partnership has
= been released, upon giving an undertaking, as prescribed in
the last three sections, if the execution, by virtue of which
the levy was made, is set aside, or is satisfied without a
sale of the interest levied upon, the undertaking enures

to the beneiit of each judgment creditor of the san1e judgment debtor, then having an execution in the hands of the

same ollicer, or of another officer, having authority to levy
upon that interest, as if it had been given to obtain a release from a seizure, made by virtue of such an execution.

§ 1417. Where personal property of a partnership has
been so released, the interest of the judgment debtor therein

may be sold by the officer; and the purchaser, upon the sale,»

acquires all that interest, as if he Was an assignee thereof.
If the purchase money exceeds the amount of all the executions and Warrants of attachment, against the property of
the same judgment debtor, of Which the oiiicer has notice,
and of the lawful fees and charges thereon, the oliicer must
pay the surplus into court, for the benefit of the judgment
debtor, or other person entitled thereto.

§ 1418. If personal property, levied upon as the property
of the judgment debtor, is claimed, by or in behalf of
another person, as his property, the officer may, in his discretion, empanel a  to try the validity of the claim.

§ 1419. If, by their inquisition, the jurors find that the
property belongs to the claimant, they must also determine
its value. Thereupon the oliicer must relinquish the levy,
unless the judgment creditor gives him an undertaking,
With at least two sufiicient sureties, to the effect, that the
sureties Will indemnify him, to an amount therein specified,
not less than twice the value of the property, as determined
by the jury, and two hundred and fifty dollars in addition
thereto, against all damages, costs and expenses, in an action
to be brought against him, by the claimant, his assignee, or
other representative, by reason of the levy upon or sale of
any of the property, by virtue of the execution. If the
undertaking is given, the oilicer must detain the property,
as belonging to the judgment debtor.

§ 1420. If the property is found to belong to the defendant, the finding does not prejudice the right of the claimant,

to bring an action to recover the property so levied upon, or
damages by reason of the levy thereupon, or the sale thereof.

§ 1421. Where an action to recover a chattel, levied upon
by virtue of an execution, or a warrant of attachment, or to
recover damages by reason of a levy upon, or a sale or
removal of personal property, by virtue of an execution, or
a warrant of attachment, is hereafter brought against an
ofhcer, or against a person who acted by his command or in
his aid, if a bond or written undertaking, indemnifying the
oilicer against the levy or other act, was given, in behalf of
the judgment creditor, or the plaintiff in the warrant, before
the action was commenced, the person or persons who gave
it, or the survivors, if one or more are dead, may apply to
the court,- for an order to substitute the applicants, as
defendants in the action, in place of the oilicer, or of the
person so acting by his command, or in his aid.

§ 1422. Notice of the application must be given to the
attorney for each party to the action. If the defendant
has not appeared, notice must be given to him personally.
If the pleadings do not sufhciently show, that the case is
one where the order may be granted, the facts, with respect
thereto, must be shown by affidavit, or other competent
proof. The motion papers must contain a written consent,
to be made a defendant in the action, executed by each
person, who executed the instrument of indemnity, unless
proof, by affidavit, is furnished, that those who do not consent are dead. Each consent must be acknowledged or

proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be
recorded in the county

§ 1423. Upon granting the order, the court may, in its
discretion, require the applicants to furnish additional security to the plaintiff, and to pay the reasonable expenses of
the defendant, necessarily incurred before the order is
granted; or it may impose such other terms, for the security of either of the original parties, as justice requires.

§ 1424. If the indemnity, given by the applicants, related to a part only of the property, the court may, in a proper §
case, direct, that the action be divided into two actions; 
that the applicants be substituted as defendants in one,
Without affecting the other; and that the controversy in
each action be limited to that part of the property, in
respect to which it is to be continued. Where such an
order is made, a similar application. may be subsequently
made, in the action which proceeds against the original
defendant.

§ 1425. If the oflicer, or person acting by his command, ;
or in his aid, is joined as a defendant, with all the persons '
entitled to make an application, they may apply for an t
order to strike out his name, as a defendant. If he is joined 1
as a defendant, with one or more, but not all of them, those
Who are not made defendants, may apply to be substituted as
defendants in his place. In either case, the application is
made in the same manner, and is subject to the same provisions, as if it Was made as prescribed in section 1421 of
this act.

§ 1426. An order, made as prescribed in the last five sections, does not affect the merits of the cause of action, or
of the defence, except so far as it limits the controversy to
particular property. But if the substituted or remaining
defendants recover judgment, they are entitled to single
costs only. If the action is discontinued, or the complaint
dismissed, a new action may be brought, as if the former
action had not been brought.

§ 1427. Where an action is brought, in a case Where one
or more persons are entitled to make an application, for an
order of substitution, as prescribed in section 1421 of this
act, the ofHcer, to Whom the instrument of indemnity Was
given, cannot maintain an action thereupon, against a person entitled to make, but who has not made, such an
application; unless notice of the commencement of the

action against the officer, or the person acting by his command, or in his aid, is given, before the trial thereof, or at
least ten days before judgment by default is taken therein,
either to the attorney Whose name is subscribed to the
execution or Warrant of attachment, or, personally, to the
judgment creditor, or to the plaintiff in the action in which
the Warrant of attachment Was issued, or to one of the
persons who executed the instrument of indemnity.

§ 1428. Personal property must be oifered for sale, in
such lots and parcels, as are calculated to bring the highest
price. Except where the oiiicer is expressly authorized, by
this article, to sell property not in his possession, personal
property shall not be offered for sale, unless it is present,
and within the view of those attending the sale.

§ 1429. At least six days’ previous notice of the time

and he, or his under-sheriif, or a deputy-sheri:H:' authorized,
in his behalf, to receive the necessary money and the necessary papers, is not present, the money may be paid, and the
papers may be delivered, to the sheriff then in ofiice, or to the
under-sheriff or a deputy-sheriif of the latter.

§ 1456. If the purchaser, at the execution sale, of property, which can be redeemed by a creditor, as prescribed in
this article, is also a creditor of the judgment debtor, and
as such could redeem from a purchaser, or a redeeming creditor, he may avail himself of his judgment or mortgage, to
redeem from any other redeeming creditor.

§ 1457. The judgmentcreditor, by virtue of whose execu- .
tion real property has been sold, cannot avail himself of the ,‘
judgment, upon which the execution was issued, to redeem 1
the property; nor, except as otherwise specially prescribed 
in this article, can a creditor, who has once redeemed, avail ;
himself of the same judgment or mortgage, to redeem again.
But if either has another judgment or mortgage, which
would entitle him to redeem, he may avail himself thereof
for that purpose, in the same manner and on the same
terms, as any other creditor.

§ 1458. Where a person, who has an absolute title to, or
a judgment or mortgage, which is a lien upon, a distinct 
parcel only of. the real property, sold by virtue of an exe- 7
cution, would be authorized, by this article, to redeem the 3
property, if his title or lien extended to the whole, he may
redeem, from a purchaser, the entire property sold, or from
a prior redeeming creditor, the entire property redeemed by
that creditor; except that if his title or lien extends to a
distinct parcel only of one or more parts of the property,
which were separately. sold, he can redeem, from a purchaser, only the part or parts thus separately sold, in which
his distinct parcel is included.

§ 1459. Where two or more persons own undivided;
shares, as joint tenants, or as tenants in common, in real .
property, sold by virtue of an. execution, or in a distinct 1
parcel thereof, which has been separately sold; each of
them may redeem, from the purchaser, as prescribed in sections 1446 and 1447 of this act, the share or interest,
belonging to him, by paying a part of the purchase money,
bid for the property, or for that distinct parcel thereof,
bearing the same proportion to the whole, as the share or
interest, proposed to be redeemed, bears to the property, or
distinct parcel separately sold, of which it is a part; together
with interest on the sum so paid, from the time of the sale,
at the rate of ten per centum a year.

§ 1460. Where the judgment or mortgage of a creditor,
entitled to redeem, is a lien upon an undivided share, specified in the last section, he may redeem, from a purchaser, that
undivided share, by paying him the same proportion of the
purchase money, which the owner must have paid to redeem
it, as prescribed in the last section; or he may redeem, from
a prior redeeming creditor, the entire property redeemed by
the latter, with like eifect and in the same manner, as if his
lien attached to the whole.

§ 1461. The sheriff, the purchaser, the judgment creditor,
or a redeeming creditor, cannot, by his agreement or other
act, in any manner impair or prejudice the right of any
other person to redeem, as prescribed in this ‘article.

§ 1462. The money required to be paid by a creditor, in
order to eifect a redemption of real property, as prescribed
in this article, may be paid to the purchaser or creditor,
from whom the property is to be redeemed, his executor,
administrator, or assignee; or it may be paid, for the use of

the person so entitled thereto, to the sheriff who made the
sale.

§ 1463. The certificate of satisfaction, required to be
executed by a creditor, in order to effect a redemption
of real property, must be acknowledged or proved, and
certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the
county; must describe, With reasonable certainty, the judgment or mortgage under which he redeems, and specify
the sum due thereupon; and must state, that the redemption satisfies the judgment or mortgage, in full, or to a specified amount. It must be filed in the county clerk’s oflice,
at or before the time when the money is paid to effect the
redemption, unless the money is paid to the sheriif; in which
case, the certificate must also be delivered, at the time of
the payment, to the sheriif, who must file it in the county
clerk’s oiiice, before he executes a deed of the property.

The county clerk, immediately after the execution and
recording of the deed, must enter, in his docket, the satisfaction, or partial satisfaction, of a judgment, specified in a certificate so filed, as required by law, when a judgment
is collected, by virtue of an execution. If a mortgage, specified in the certificate, is recorded in his odice, he must cancel
and discharge the mortgage of record, if it is satisfied
by the certificate; or, if it is only partially satisfied, he
must make a minute of the partial satisfaction, upon the
record thereof. If the property mortgaged is situated in a
county, in which there is a register, the county clerk must
transmit a certified copy of the certificate to the register,
Who must, in like manner, cancel and discharge the mortgage of record, or make a minute of the partial satisfaction

' thereof. The clerk’s and register’s fees, for performing the

services specified in this section, must be paid by the sheriff ;
who may require the person entitled to a deed to pay him
the amount thereof, before the deed is delivered. '

§ 1464. In order to entitle a creditor by judgment to redeem real property, as prescribed in this article, he must,
when he redeems, file in the county clerk’s oihce, or deliver
to the sheriff, as the case requires, the following evidence of
his right :

1. A copy of the docket of the judgment, under which

he claims the right to redeem, duly certified by the county

clerk.

2. Each assignment of the judgment, which is necessary
to establish his right. The assignment so delivered or filed
must be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded, or the execution thereof must
be proved, by the aflidavit of the creditor, or of a Witness
thereto; unless it has been filed, and entered, as prescribed
in article third of title first of chapter eleventh of this act,
in Which case, a certified copy thereof must be filed or delivered.

3. An atlidavit, made by him, or his attorney or agent,
stating truly the sum remaining unpaid on the judgment,
at the time of claiming the right to redeem.

§ 1465. In order to entitle a creditor by mortgage to redeem real property, as prescribed in this article, he must,
when he redeems, file in the county clerk’s office, or deliver
to the sheriff, the following evidence of his right:

1. A copy of the mortgage, under which he claims the
right to redeem, duly certified by the clerk or register of
the county.

2. Each assignment of the mortgage, which is necessary
to establish his right, acknowledged or proved, and certilied, as prescribed in the last section for an assignment of a
judgment, unless it has been recorded; in which case a
certified copy of the record must be filed or delivered.

3. An aifidavit, made by him, or by his attorney or agent,
stating truly the sum remaining unpaid on the mortgage, at
the time of claiming the right to redeem.

§ 1466. In either of the cases speciiied in the last two sections, if the person, proposing to redeem, claims to be entitled so to do, by reason of his being an executor or administrator of a person, who, if living, would be entitled to_

redeem, he must file or deliver, with the other papers therein
prescribed, a certified copy or a sworn copy of his letters
testamentary, or letters of administration.

§ 1467. The sheriif, to whom one or more papers, specified
in the last four sections, are delivered, must keep them
open, at all reasonable times during the period allowed for
redemption, to the inspection of all persons interested. He
must have all those papers at the sheriif’s ofiice, at the times
when he is required to attend thereat, for the purpose . of
enabling creditors to redeem, as prescribed by law; and he
must file them in the county clerk’s oflice, within three days

after the execution of the deed.

§ 1468. A redemption by a creditor is eifected, only
when he has paid all the money, required to be paid, and
filed or delivered all the papers, required to be filed or

delivered, as prescribed in this article; and a waiver of any
of those requirements is void, as against a person who is
entitled subsequently to redeem. Where a redemption is
thus effected, it vests in the redeeming creditor all the
right, title, and interest, which the purchaser acquired by
the sale.

§ 1469. Where a redemption is made, as prescribed in
this article, the oiiicer or other person, to Whom money is
paid, or a paper is delivered, for the purpose of eifecting
the redemption, must execute and deliver, to the person
paying the money or delivering the paper, a certificate,
stating all the facts which transpired before him, with
respect to the redemption.

§ 1470. Such a certiiicate may be acknowledged or proved,
and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in
the county Where the property is situated. The recording
thereof, in the ofrice of the clerk or register of that county,
in the book for recording deeds, has the same effect, as
against subsequent purchasers and incumbrancers, as the
recording of a conveyance.

§ 1471. Immediately after the expiration of fifteen months
from the time of the sale; except Where a redemption has
been made on the last day of the fifteen months, and, in
that case, immediately after the expiration of twenty-four
hours from the last redemption; the sheriif, who made the
sale, must execute the proper deed or deeds, in order to
convey to the person or persons entitled thereto, the part or
parts of the property sold, which have not been redeemed
by the judgment debtor, his heir, devisee, or assignee. The
deed conveys to the grantee therein the right, title, and
interest, which were sold by the sheriff.

§ 1472. If any part of the property remains unredeemed
by a creditor, it must be conveyed, by the sheriif, to the
purchaser upon the sale, except Where the certificate of sale

has been assigned; in which case, it must be conveyed to
the last assignee. Any part or parts of the property sold,
which have been redeemed by a creditor, must be conveyed
by the sheriff, to the last redeeming creditor, except where
he has assigned the certificate of redemption, or has executed any other assignment of his right, title, and interest in
the property redeemed by him; in which case, it must be
conveyed to the last assignee.

§ 1473. Where a person, entitled to a deed, dies before
the delivery of the deed, the sheriff must execute and
deliver the deed to his executor or administrator. The
property so conveyed must be held, in trust for the use of
the heirs or devisees of the decedent, subject to the dower
of his widow, if there is one; but it may be sold, in a proper
case, for the payment of his debts, in the same manner as
land, whereof he died seized.

§ 1474. Before an assignee, or his executor or administrator, is entitled to a deed, as prescribed in the last two sections, each assignment, under which the deed is claimed,
must be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in like manner as a deed to be recorded in the county where the property is situated, and must be filed in the office of the clerk

of that county.

§ 1475. Where a sheriif dies, is removed from office, or
becomes otherwise disqualified to act, at any time after
making a sale of real property, by virtue of an execution,
the property, or a distinct parcel thereof, may be redeemed,
by paying the necessary money, and delivering the necessary
papers, to his under-sheriff, who must also execute and
deliver the proper deed or deeds of property, not redeemed
by the judgment debtor, his heir, devisee, or grantee. If
the under-sheriff also dies, is removed from oflice, or becomes otherwise disqualified to act, the property may be
redeemed, by paying the necessary money, and delivering

the necessary papers, to the sheriffs successor in oilice, who
must also execute and deliver the proper deed or deeds.
The under-sheriff, or the sheriffs successor, as the case
requires, possesses all the powers, and is subject to all the
duties and liabilities, of the sheriff who made the sale,
touching the redemption and conveyance of property sold,
and the proceedings relating thereto: and each provision
of law, regulating those proceedings, and applicable to the
sheriff Who made the sale, is applicable to his under-sheriff
or successor. This section applies Where a sale was made,
either before or after this act takes effect.

§ 1476. Where real property is sold, by virtue of an execution, by the under-sheriif or a deputy-sheriff, in behalf of
the sheriff, money required to be paid, or a paper required
to be delivered, to the sheriff, in order to effect a redemption,
as prescribed in this article, at any time before the last
day of the fifteen months from the time of the sale, may be
paid or delivered, either to the sheriff, or to the under-sheriff
or deputy-sheriff, who made the sale. .

§ 1477. Where real property is sold, by virtue of an
execution, by a person specially appointed by the court, as
prescribed in section 1362 or section 1388 of this act, it
may be redeemed, as prescribed in this article, as if it had
been sold by the sheriff, except as follows:

1. Money, required to be paid, or a paper, required to be
delivered, to the sheriff, in order to effect a redemption, as prescribed in this article, at any time before the last day of the
fifteen months from the time of the sale, must be paid to the
oiiicer Who made the sale; unless the person entitled to redeem, his agent or attorney, files with the clerk of the county,
With the paper or papers required to be filed, or to be delivered to the sheriff, for the purpose of effecting the redemption, his aflidavit, to the effect, that the oiiicer is dead; or
has been removed ; or, Where he is a coroner, that he is no
longer in oflice ; or that after diligent search, the aiiiant has
been unable to find him Within the county; in which case, the

money may be paid into court, by paying it to the county
treasurer, to the credit of the cause, With like effect, as
Where it is paid to the sheriff, after a sale by the latter.

2. The provisions of section 1455 of this act, apply to a
redemption, upon a sale made as prescribed in this section;
and the officer, who sold the property, must attend, as the
sheriif is therein required to attend. If he is not present,
the redemption may be effected, as prescribed in that section, for redemption in a case, Where the term of office of

the sheriff, who made the sale, has expired.

§ 1478. If, when the period for redemption expires, a
coroner, or a person specially appointed by the court, who
has‘ sold real property, by virtue of an execution, is dead,
or has been removed, or, in the case of a coroner, if he is
no longer in office, the court must, upon the application of
a person entitled to a deed, appoint a person, to execute
the deed accordingly.

the sale, With interest. He may accordingly have a further

debtor, having an absolute title to a distinct parcel of real
property, sold by virtue of an execution, redeems, as prescribed in section 1458 of this act, the property sold, or any

similar ailidavit and notice must be filed with, and a similar entry made by, the clerk of each county.
