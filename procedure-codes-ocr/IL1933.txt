merits, and not then unless it appears from the record or the evidence
that the defendant residing within the county was joined with probable
cause and in good faith for the purpose of obtaining a judgment against
him and was not joined solely for the purpose of nxing the venue of the
action in that county. If all defendants are non-residents of the State,
an action may be commenced in any county.

law or fact would arise: Provided, that if upon the application of any
party it shall appear that such joinder may embarrass or delay the
trial of the action-, the court may order separate trials or make such
order as may be expedient, and judgment may be given for such one or
more of the plaintiffs as may be found to be entitled to relief, for the
relief to which he or they may be entitled.

If any one who is a necessary plaintiff declines to join, he may
be made a defendant, the reason therefor being stated in- the complaint.

§ 24. Any person may be made

he is entitled to redress, he may join- two or more defendants, and

parties, the court may direct them to be brought in. Where a person,

justice may require.

§ 27. When several joint
debtors are sued, and any one or more of them shall not be served with
process, the pendency of such suit or the recovery of a judgment against
the parties served shall not be a bar to a recovery on the original cause

thereafter brought. This section shall not be so construed as to allow
more than one satisfaction.

court may order new bonds it such new bonds are deemed necessary.
Orders of court concerning change in parties may be upon terms at
the discretion of the court.

requisites heretofore appertaining to the manner of pleading in such
actions respectively, shall hereafter be deemed necessary or appropriate,
and there shall be no distinctions respecting the manner of pleading
between such actions at law and suits in equity, other than those specified in this Act an-d the rules adopted pursuant thereto; but this section
shall not be deemed to affect in any Way the substantial averments of
fact necessary to state any cause of action either at law or in equity.

(2) Proceedings in attachment, ejectment, eminent domain, forcible entry and detainer, garnishment, habeas corpus, mandamus, ne
eareat, quo Warranto and replevin, or other actions in which the procedure is regulated by special statutes, shall be in accordance with the

be filed by the plaintiff. Further pleadings may be permitted as required by the court.

§ 33. All pleadings shall contain a
plain and concise statement of the pleader’s cause of action, counterclaim, defense, or reply.

himself entitled. Such relief. whether based on one or,more counts.
may be asked in the alternative. Demand for relief which the allegations of the pleading do not sustain may be objected to on motion or
in the answering pleading. Except in case of default, the prayer for
relief shall not be deemed to limit the relief obtainable but where other
relief is sought the court shall, by proper orders, and upon such terms

as may be just, protect the adverse party against prejudice by reason
of surprise.

§ 35. Any pleading, although
not required to be sworn to, may be verified by the oath of the party
filing the same or of any other person or persons having knowledge
of the facts pleaded. Corporations may verify by the oath of any odicer
or agent having knowledge of such facts. And where any pleading is
so verified, every subsequent pleading must also be verined, unless such
verification is excused by the court. In pleadings which are verified by

on the information and belief of such party.

is founded upon a written instrument, a copy thereof, or of so much
of the same as is relevant, must be attached to the pleading as an exhibit or recited therein, unless the pleader shall attach to his pleading an
affidavit stating facts showing that such instrument is not accessible to
him. In pleading any written instrument a copy thereof may be attached to the pleading as an exhibit. In either case the exhibit shall
constitute a part of the pleading for all purposes. No profert shall be
necessary.

§ 37. Where allegations are so wanting in details, that the opposite party should be entitled to a bill of
particulars, the pleader shall file and serve a copy of such bill on being
served with a notice demanding the same, which notice shall point out
specifically the defects complained of or the details desired, and if such
bill he demanded before the expiration of the time for filing a pleading,
the opposite party shall have the same time to plead after receiving
the bill of particulars to which he was entitled at the time of serving
such notice. ,

(2) If the party shall unreasonably neglect to furnish a bill of particulars, or if the bill of particulars delivered be insufficient, the court
may in its discretion strike the pleading, allow further time to furnish
such bill of particulars or require a more particular bill to be delivered.

' contains the statement of items of indebtedness and is verified by oath,

the items thereof shall be deemed admitted except in so far as the opposite party shall file an affidavit specifically denying the same, and as to

unless such affidavit is excused by the court.

has been made believes that the party demanding the same is not entitled
to the particulars asked for, he may move the court that the demand
be denied or modified.

one or more defendants against one or more plaintiffs, or against one
or more co-defendants, whether in the nature of set-off, recoupment;
cross-bill in equity or otherwise, and whether in tort or contract. for
liquidated or unliquidated damages, or for other relief, may be pleaded
as a cross-demand in any action, and when so pleaded shall be called
a counterclaim.

(2). The counterclaim shall be a part of the answer, and shall be
designated as a counterclaim.

(3) Every counterclaim shall be pleaded in the same manner and
with the same particularity as a complaint, and shall be complete in
itself, but allegations set forth in other parts of the answer may be incorporated by specific reference instead of being repeated.

§ 39. Subject to rules, supplemental
pleadings, setting up matters which have arisen after the original pleadings were filed, may be filed within a reasonable time by either party by
leave of court and upon terms, but no pleading in the nature of a plea
puis darrein continuance shall constitute a waiver of other answers or

defenses.

§ 40. General issues shall not
be employed, and every answer and subsequent pleading shall contain an
explicit admission or denial of each allegation of the pleading to which it
relates.

(2) Every allegation, except allegations of damages, not explicitly
denied shall be deemed to be admitted, unless the party shall state in his
pleading that he has no knowledge thereof sufficient to form a belief, and
shall attach an aiiidavit of the truth of such statement of want of knowledge, or unless the party has had no opportunity to deny.

(3) Denials must not be evasive, but must fairly answer the substance of the allegation denied.

damages only, he may do so by stating in his pleading that he desires to
contest only the amount of the damages.

§ 41. Allegations and denials, made without reasonable cause and not in good faith, and found to be untrue, shall
subject the party pleading the same to the payment of such reasonable
expenses, to be summarily taxed by the court at the trial, as may have
been actually incurred by the other party, by reason of such untrue
pleading.

§ 42. If any pleading is insufficient in substance or form the court may order a fuller or more particular ‘

statement; and if the pleadings do not sufficiently define the issues the
court may order other pleadings prepared.

the nature of the claim or defense which he is called upon to meet.

(3) All defects in pleadings, either in form or substance, not
objected to in the trial court, shall be deemed to be waived.

§ 43. Parties may plead
as many causes of action, counterclaims, defenses, and matters in reply or

rejoinder as they may have, and each shall be separately designated and
numbered.

(2) When a party is in doubt as to which of two or more statements of fact is true, he may state them in the alternative, or, when they
appear in different counts or defenses (whether legal or equitable) he
may state the counts or defenses which contain them in the alternative,
and a bad alternative shall not affect a good one.

(3) All defenses, whether to the jurisdiction or in abatement or in
bar, may be pleaded together, but the court may order defenses to the
jurisdiction or in abatement to be tried first. An answer containing only
defenses to the jurisdiction or in abatement shall not constitute an
admission of the facts alleged in the plaintiff’s complaint.

(4) The facts constituting any aflirmative defense, such as payment, release, satisfaction, discharge, license, fraud, duress, estoppel,
laches, statute of frauds, illegality, that an instrument or transaction is
either void or voidable in point of law, or cannot be recovered upon by
reason of any statute or by reason of non-delivery, Want or failure of
consideration in whole or in part, and any defense which by other affirmative matter seeks to avoid the legal effect of or defeat the cause of action
set forth in the plainti1f’s complaint, or the defendant’s counterclaim, in
whole or in part, and any ground or defense, whether affirmative or not,
which if not expressly stated in the pleading, would be likely to take the
opposite party by surprise, must be plainly set forth in the answer
or reply.

§ 44. Subject to rules any

plaintiff or plaintiffs may join any causes of action, whether legal or
equitable or both, against any defendant or defendants; and subject to
rules the defendant may set up in his answer any and all crossdemands, whatever, whether in the nature of recoupment, set-off, cross ~

bill in equity or otherwise, which shall be designated counterclaims.
But the court may, in its discretion, order separate trials of any such
causes of action or counterclaims if they cannot be conveniently disposed
of with the other issues in the case. Legal and equitable issues may
be tried together where no jury is employed.

(2) Any cause of action or counterclaim may be transferred at
any time, by order of the court, from the law docket to the equity
docket, or vice versa, as convenience and the nature of such action or
counterclaim may require, and when so transferred shall proceed as
though commenced on the proper side of the court; and any issue may
at any time, by order of the court, be transferred for trial to the proper
side of the court. .

§ 45. All
objections to pleadings heretofore raised by demurrer shall be raised by
motion. Such motion shall point out specifically the defects complained
of, and shall ask for such relief as the nature of the defects may make
appropriate, such as the dismissal of the action or the entry of a judgment where a pleading is substantially insufficient in law, or that a

pleading be made more definite and certain in a specined particular, or s

that designated immaterial matter be stricken out, or that necessary

parties be added, or that designated misjoined parties be dismissed, and
so forth.

(2) Where a pleading or a division thereof is objected to by a
motion to dismiss or for judgment or to strike out the pleading, because
it is substantially insufficient in law, the motion must specify wherein
such pleading or division thereof is insufficient.

(3) After rulings on motions, the court may make such orders as
to pleading over or amending as may be just. a

(4) Upon motions based upon defects in pleadings, substantial
defects in prior pleadings may be considered in so far as they are

material to the ruling sought.

§ 46. At any time before final judgment in a civil action, amendments may be allowed on such terms as are just and reasonable,
introducing any party who ought to have been joined as plaintiff or
defendant, discontinuing as to any plaintiff or defendant, changing the
cause of action or defense or adding new causes of action or defenses,
and in any matter, either of form or substance, in any process, pleading
or proceedings, which may enable the plaintiff to sustain the claim for
which it was intended to be brought _or the defendant to make a defense
or assert a cross demand. .

(2) The cause of action, cross demand or defense set up in any
amended pleading shall not be barred by, lapse of time under any statute
or contract prescribing or limiting the time within which an action may
be brought or right asserted, if the time prescribed or limited had not
expired when the original pleading was filed, and if it shall appear from
the original and amended pleadings that the cause of action asserted, or
the defense or cross demand interposed in the amended pleading grew
out of the same transaction or occurrence set up in the original pleading,
even though the original pleading was defective in that it failed to allege
the performance of some act or the existence of some fact or some other
matter which is a necessary condition precedent to the right of recovery
or defense asserted when such condition precedent has in fact been
performed, and for the purpose of preserving as aforesaid such cause of
action, cross demand or defense set up in such amended pleading, and
for such purpose only, any such amendment to any pleading shall be held

to relate back to the date of ,the filing of the original pleading.

so amended.

(3) A pleading may be amended at any time, before or after judgment, to conform the pleadings to the proofs, upon such terms as to
costs and continuance as may be just.

§ 47. In any action where any pleading or

paper nled in the cause has been lost or mislaid, the court in which saidaction is pending may permit such files to be supplied by the filing of a
copy authenticated by such aflidavits as the court may require.

by affidavits where any of the said following defects exist but do not
appear upon the face of the complaint:

(a) That the court has not jurisdiction of the person of the
defendant.

(b) That the court has not jurisdiction of the subject matter of
the action or suit, provided the defect cannot be removed by a transfer of
the case to a court having jurisdiction.

(c) That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue.

(d) That there is another action pending between the same
parties for the same cause.

(e) That the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment.

(f) That the cause of action did not accrue within the time
limited by law for the commencement of an action or suit thereon.

(g) That the claim or demand set forth in the plaintift"s pleading
has been released.

(h) That the claim on which the action or suit is founded is
unenforceable under the provisions of the Statute of frauds.

(i) That the cause of action did not accrue against defendant
because of his infancy or other disability.

(2) A similar motion may be made by the plaintiff in case of a
counterclaim, under similar circumstances.

(3) If, upon thehearing of such motion, the opposite party shall
present affidavits or other proof denying the facts alleged or establishing
facts obviating the objection, the court may hear and determine the
same and may grant or deny the motion; but if disputed questions of
fact are involved the court may deny the motion without prejudice and
shall so deny it if the action is one at law and the opposite party demands that the issue be submitted to a jury.

(4) The raising of any of the foregoing defenses to the action by
motion shall not preclude the raising of them subsequently by answer
unless the court shall have made a decision therein; and a failure" to
raise any of them by motion shall not prejudice raising them by answer.

§ 49. The form and contents of motions,
notices regarding the same, hearings on motions, and all other matters
of’ procedure relative thereto, shall be according to rules.

§ 50. Judgment may be given for or against one or more
of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several defendants; and the court may determine the ultimate rights of the parties
on each side as between themselves, and grant to the defendant any
aflirmative relief to which he may be entitled on his pleadings and
proofs; and when an action or counterclaim is sustained in favor of, or
against, only a part of the parties thereto, judgment may be rendered
in favor of or against such parties respectively at any stage of the
proceedings. But an unsatisfied judgment against one, or some, of
several joint contractors, shall not discharge the other joint contractors
from liability on the contract. The court shall control the proceedings
so that the plaintiff shall receive but one satisfaction. A writ of execution may issue upon one or more judgments rendered in the same cause.

Judgment may be entered in such form as may be required by the
nature of the case and by the recovery or relief awarded, and more
than one judgment may be rendered in the same cause.

(2) Any party aggrieved by any such judgment may have a review thereof as herein provided, even though said cause remains undisposed of as to other parties. (3) In case a counterclaim is filed, the judgment shall be so
drawn as to protect the interests of both parties, and subject to rules,
no execution shall be issued until all the issues in the case have been
determined by the judgment, except by leave of court.

(4) A judgment for the plaintiff on an issue as to the truth of
any defense in abatement shall be that the defendant answer over.

(5) Any person for a debt bona jtde due may confess judgment by himself or attorney duly authorized either in term time or
vacation, without process. ‘Judgments entered in vacation shall have
like force and effect, and from the date thereof, become liens in like
manner and extent as judgments entered in term.

(6) Judgment by default or a decree pro confesso may be entered
for want of an appearance, or for failure to plead. but the court may in
either case, require the plaintiff to prove the allegations of his complaint.

(7) The court may in its discretion before final judgment, set
aside any default, and may within thirty days after entry thereof, set
aside any judgment or decree upon good cause shown by affidavit, upon
such terms and conditions as shall be reasonable.

(8) When ‘any final decree in chancery shall be entered against
any defendant who shall have been served by publication with notice
of the commencement of the suit and who shall not have been served
with a copy of the complaint, or received the notice required to be
sent him by mail, or otherwise brought into court, and such person,
his heirs. devisees, or personal representatives, as the case may require,
shall, within ninety days after notice in writing given him of such
decree. or within one year after such decree, if no such notice shall
have been given as aforesaid, appear in open court and petition to
be heard touching the matter of such decree, the court shall upon
notice being given to the parties to said suit who appeared therein
and the purchaser at a sale made pursuant to such decree, or their
solicitors, set such petition down for hearing and may allow the parties
and such purchaser to answer such petition. If upon the hearing upon
said petition it shall appear that such decree ought not to have been
made against such defendant, the same may be set aside, altered or
amended as shall appear just; otherwise such petition shall be dismissed at petitioner’s costs; provided, however, that if a sale shall
have been had under and pursuant to such final decree the court,
in altering or amending such decree, may, upon terms just an equitable to such defendant, permit such sale to stand. If upon the hearing
of such petition it shall appear that such defendant was entitled under
the law to redeem in equity from such sale, the court shall enter its
decree permitting such redemption to be made at any time within
ninety days thereafter, upon such terms as shall be equitable and just.

§ 51. An action may
be severed, and actions pending in the same court may be consolidated,
as an aid to convenience, whenever it can be done without prejudice to
a substantial right.

§ 52. The plaintiff may, at any time
before trial- or hearing begins, upon notice to the defendant or his attorney, and on the payment of costs, dismiss his action or any part
thereof as to such defendant, without prejudice, by order filed in the
cause. Thereafter he may dismiss, on the same terms, only (1) upon
filing a stipulation to that effect signed by such defendant, or (2) on
the order of the court or judge made on special motion in which the
ground for such dismissal shall be set forth and which shall be supported by affidavit. After a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant no dismissal may be had as to him except by consent of the
defendant.

§ 53. In an action on a penal bond
the plaintiff may allege as many breaches as he may think fit and
damages shall be assessed for such of the breaches as are proved, and
the judgment for the penalty shall stand as security for such other
breaches as may thereafter happen, and the plaintiff may at any time
thereafter, by motion, upon 10 days’ notice, have the said cause placed on
the docket for assessment of damages for such subsequent breaches as
are set forth in such motion; and an order shall be made after each
assessment of damages for an execution on said judgment for the
amount of damages so assessed until the full amount of such judgment
shall be paid.

§ 54. Where by
reason of marriage, death, bankruptcy, assignment, or any other event
occurring after the commencement of a cause or proceeding, either before
or after judgment and in the trial or reviewing court, causing a change
or transmission of interest or liability, or by reason of any person
interested coming into existence after such commencement, it becomes
necessary or desirable that any person not already a party should be
before the court, or that any person already a party should be made
party in another capacity, the action shall not abate, but an order may
be made that the husband or wife, heir, personal representative, trustee,
assignee, or other successor in interest, if any, be made a party in substitution for or in addition _to any other party, and that the cause or
proceeding be carried on with the continuing parties and such new
parties, with or without a change in the title of the cause, on motion of
anyone interested supported by affidavits, and such reasonable notice of
the order to any new parties to be brought in as the court or tribunal
may designate in such order.

§ 55. It shall not be necessary to use a writ of scire facias, but any relief which heretofore might
have been obtained by scire facias may be had by employing an ordinary
civil action at law.

§ 56. When judgment shall be arrested
for any defect in the record of proceedings after the first process, the
plaintiff shall not be compelled to commence his action anew; but the

court shall order new pleadings to commence with the error which cause
the arrest.

§ 57. Subject to rules, if the plaintiff,
in any action upon a contract, express or implied, or upon a judgment
or decree for the payment of money, or in any action to recover possession
of land, with or without rent or mesne profits, or in any action to recover
possession of specific chattels, shall nle an affidavit or affidavits, on the
afBant’s personal knowledge, of the truth of the facts upon which his
complaint is based and the amount claimed (if any) over and above all
just deductions, credits and set-offs (if any), the court shall, upon
plaintiff’s motion, enter a judgment in his favor for the relief so demanded, unless the defendant shall, by afiidavit of merits filed prior to or
at the time of the hearing on said motion, show that he has a sufficiently
good defense on the merits to all or some part of the plaintiff’s claim to
entitle him to defend the action. If the defense is to a part only of
the plaintiff’s demand a judgment may be entered, and an execution or
other suitable Writ issued, for the balance of the demand, and the case
shall thereafter proceed as to the portion of the plaintiff’s demand in
dispute as though the action had been originally brought therefor; and
in such case the court may make such order as to the costs of the suit
as may be equitable.

§ 58. Wherever a bill for discovery, or interrogatories in a bill for relief, would heretofore have been available, the
same discovery may hereafter be' had by motion iiled in the cause
wherein the matters sought to be discovered would be used.

(2) Discovery of documents which are or have been in the possession of any other party to the action may be had, admissions as to
any fact may be requested of any other party, and the deposition of any
other party or of any person may be taken, at such times and under
such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by rules.

§ 59. Additional time
may be granted on good cause shown, in the discretion of the court and
on such terms as may be just, for the doing of any act or the taking of
any step or proceeding prior to judgment in any civil action.

The circumstances, terms and conditions under which continuances
may be granted, the time and manner in which application therefor
shall be made, and the effect thereof, shall be according to rules.

§ 60. Upon the trial of any case any party thereto or any person for whose
immediate benefit such action is prosecuted or defended, or the officers,
directors, or managing agents of any corporation which is a party to the
action, may be examined as if under cross examination at the instance

of the adverse party or parties or any of them, and for that purpose ‘

may be compelled, in the same manner and subject to the same rules for
examination as any other witness, to testify, but the party calling for
such examination shall not be concluded thereby but may rebut the
testimony thus given by counter testimony.

§ 61. Subject to rules, the
court may in any chancery action, or in any action at law in which
matters of account are in controversy, on default or upon issue joined,

refer the cause to a master or referee to take testimony and report his
conclusions thereon.

§ 62. The clerk of any court in which an action is
pending shall, from time to time, issue subpoenas for such witnesses and
to such counties in the State as may be required by either party, and
every clerk who shall refuse so to do shall be nned, at the discretion of
the court, in any sum not to exceed $100.00.

§ 63. Subject to rules providing otherwise, the court may in its discretion direct an issue or issues to be tried
by a jury, whenever it shall be judged necessary in any cause in equity
pending therein. In all other cases in equity, the mode of trial shall be
the same as has been heretofore practiced in courts of chancery.

§ 64. A plaintiff desirous of a trial by jury shall make his demand for
a jury in writing, and file such demand with the clerk at the time suit
is commenced, and a defendant desirous of a trial by jury shall make
such demand and file the same at the time of filing appearance; otherwise
such party shall be deemed to have waived a jury. If the plaintiff files a
jury demand and thereafter waives such demand, the defendant shall be
granted a jury trial upon motion made at the time of such waiver and
upon payment of the proper fees to the clerk.

(2) No special findings of fact or propositions of law shall be
necessary in any case at law tried without a jury to support the judgment or as a basis of review. .

* (3) No special findings of fact or certificate of evidence shall be
necessary in any case in equity to support the decree.

§ 65. In any case in which the jury
render a general verdict. they may be required by the court, and must be
required on request of any party to the action,'to nnd specially upon any
material question or questions of fact which shall be stated to them in
writing, which questions of fact shall be submitted by the party requesting the same to the adverse party before the commencement of the
argument to the jury. Submitting or refusing to submit a question of
fact to the jury when requested by a party, as above provided, may be
excepted to and be reviewed on appeal, as a ruling on a question of law.
When the special finding of fact is inconsistent with the general verdict,
the former shall control the latter and the court may render judgment
accordingly.

§ 66. In all civil actions each
party shall be entitled to challenge five jurors without showing cause for
such challenges. Where there is more than one plaintiff or more than
one defendant, the judge shall allow additional challenges not to exceed
three in number to each additional plaintiff or defendant without
showing cause.

§ 67. The court shall give instructions to
the jury only as to the law of the case. They shall be in writing, in the
form of a continuous and connected narrative and not a series of separate
instructions. To assist the court in fully and accurately instructing the
jury as to the law, the parties may at any time submit to him suggestions
orally or in writing, and before the case is argued to the jury, the parties

shall be given an opportunity out of the presence of the jury to read the
instructions which he proposes to give, and then to make other or further suggestions as to matters omitted, or to make objection to such parts
thereof as are deemed to be incorrect or misleading, such suggestions or
objections to be specific. All suggestions which are not adopted and all
objections made which are overruled may be made a ground of review,
but all suggestions or objections to the instructions must be made before
the jury retires from the bar, or within such further time as the trial
court may by order allow before the jury retires from the bar, or they

— will be deemed to have been waived. Instuctions shall be taken by the

jury to the jury room, and shall be returned by them with their verdict
into court, and nled as a part of the proceedings in the cause. Papers
read in evidence, other than depositions, may be carried from the bar by
the jury. '

§ 68. It shall be suflicient for the
jury to pronounce their verdict, by their foreman, in open court, without
reducing the same to writing if it is a general verdict, and the clerk
shall enter the same in form, under the direction of the court; and if
either party may wish to move for a new trial or in arrest of judgment or
for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, he shall, before final judgment be entered, or within ten days thereafter, or within such time as
the court may allow on motion made within ten days, by himself, or
counsel, file the points in writing, particularly specifying the grounds
of such motion, and final judgment and execution thereon shall thereupon be stayed until such motion can be heard by the court.

(2) Whenever there are several counts in a complaint based on
different demands, the court shall, on the demand of either party, direct
the jury to find a separate verdict upon each. But if, in any case, there
are several counts, and an entire verdict is rendered thereon, the same
shall not be set aside or reversed on the ground of any defective count,
if one or more of the counts be sufficient to sustain the verdict.

(3) a. Hereafter in all civil actions at law, in courts of record, if
either party shall at the close of the testimony, and before the case is
submitted to the jury, request the court for a directed verdict in 
favor, the court may reserve his decision thereon, and submit the case to
the jury under proper instructions as to the law applicable to such case.
After the case is thus submitted to the jury, or after receiving and
recording the verdict of the jury and before judgment is entered in said
case, the court may hear arguments of counsel for and against said
request, but in all cases shall receive and record the verdict of the jury
as rendered. If the court shall then decide as a matter of law, that the
party requesting the directed verdict was entitled thereto, the court
shall enter its decision on the record and order judgment in accordance
with such decision notwithstanding the verdict entered. and the party
against whom such judgment is entered shall have an exception to such
action of the court as a matter of course. If such request is denied an
exception in favor of the party making such request shall follow as a
matter of course.

b. If the party against whom the verdict of the jury was rendered
shall assign error in the Appellate or Supreme Court upon the refusal

of the trial court to direct a verdict in his favor or to order judgment
entered notwithstanding the verdict, and the Appellate or Supreme
Court shall be of opinion that the trial court committed such error, the
decision of the trial court shall be reversed and judgment shall be
entered or ordered by the Appellate or Supreme Court notwithstanding
the verdict, unless it shall appear that there was such error on the trial
as would have entitled the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered
to a new trial if such verdict and judgment had been adverse to such
party, in which case a new trial shall be ordered.

If, upon such reversal by the Appellate or Supreme Court, it shall
appear that damages should have been assessed in the trial court a partial
remandment solely for the purpose of assessing such damages, shall be
ordered.

c. If the party in whose favor the verdict of the jury was rendered
shall assign error in the Appellate or Supreme Court upon the order of
the trial court entering judgment notwithstandingthe verdict, and the
Appellate or Supreme Court shall be of opinion that the trial court committed error in ordering or entering judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, such court shall reverse such order and judgment and shall order
or enter judgment in accordance with the verdict of the jury, unless it
shall appear that there was error in the case that would have entitled
the party in whose favor judgment notwithstanding the verdict was
entered, to a new trial if such judgment had not been entered by the
trial court, in which case a new trial shall be ordered.

§ 69. All aiiidavits read in court during the
progress of any case and relating thereto, shall be filed and preserved by
the clerk.

(2) Whenever in any suit or proceeding at law or in equity in any
court of record, evidence shall be necessary concerning any fact which,
according to law and the practice of the court may now be supplied by
affidavit, the court may, in its discretion, require such evidence to be
presented, wholly or in part, by oral examination of the witnesses in open
court, or, before a master in chancery, upon notice to all parties not in
default, or their attorneys, and whenever such evidence is presented by
oral examination, an adverse party shall have the right to cross examination. This section shall not apply to applications for change of venue. .

§ 70. A party intending to move, to set aside or quash any execution,
bond or other proceeding, may apply to the court or to the judge at
his chamber for a certificate (and which the said judge may, in his
discretion, grant) certifying that there is probable cause for staying
further proceedings until the order of the court on the motion, and a
service of a copy of the certificate at the time of, or after the service
of the notice of the motion, shall thenceforth stay all further proceedings accordingly. But in no case shall the judge grant such certificate
when the error complained of may, by the direction of the judge to the
clerk issuing the process, be corrected, but the judge shall order the
correction and the clerk shall make the correction in the process, nor
unless the applicant shall have given notice of such motion to the

opposite party, or his attorney of record, if they or either of them
can be found in the county from which the writ issues.

§ 71. In all actions in the
courts of record in this State upon default, when the damages are to
be assessed, it shall be lawful for the court to hear the evidence and
assess the damages without a jury for that purpose. In all cases where
interlocutory judgment shall be given in any action brought upon a
penal bond, or upon any instrument of writing, for the payment of
money only, and the damages’ rest in computation, the court may refer
it to the clerk, to assess and report the damages, and may enter" judgment therefor: Promlded, that either party may have the damages
assessed by a jury.

§ 72. The writ
of error comm nobis is hereby abolished, and all errors in fact, committed in the proceedings of any court of record, and which, by the
common law, could have been corrected by said writ, may be corrected
by said writ, may be by the court in which the error was committed,
upon motion in writing, made at any time within five years
after the rendition of final judgment in the case, upon reasonable
notice. When the person entitled to make such motion shall be an infant, non compos mantis or under duress, at the time of passing judgment, the time of such disability shall be excluded from the computation of said five years.

§ 73. This Act shall not be deemed to affect the enforcement of
judgments or decrees or proceedings supplementary thereto.

ARTICLE VIII. APPELLATE PRACTICE

§ 74. Every order, determination, decision, judgment or decree, rendered in any civil proceeding, if reviewable by the Supreme or Appellate Court of this State
by. writ of error, appeal or otherwise, shall hereafter be subject to
review by notice of appeal, and such review shall be designated an appeal and shall constitute a continuation‘ of the proceeding in the court
below. Such appeal shall be deemed to present to the court all issues
which heretofore have been presented by appeal and writ of error.

(2) All distinctions between the common law record, the bill of
exceptions and the certificate of evidence, for the purpose of determining what is properly before the reviewing court, are hereby abolished.
The trial court record -shall include every writ, pleading, motion, order,
affidavit and other document filed or entered in the cause and all matters before the trial court which shall be certified as a part of such
record by the judge thereof. All matters in the trial court record actually before the court on appeal may be considered by the court for all
purposes, but if not properly authenticated the court may order such
further authentication as it may deem advisable. w

§ 75. Appeals shall betaken directly to the Supreme Court in all cases in which
a franchise or freehold or the validity of a statute or a construction of

the constitution is involved, and in cases in which the validity of a
municipal ordinance is involved and in which the trial judge shall
certify that in his opinion the public interest so requires, and in all
cases relating to revenue, or in which the State is interested as a party
or otherwise.

(2) In all cases in which their jurisdiction is invoked pursuant
to law, except those wherein appeals are specifically required by the
Constitution of the State to be allowed from the Appellate Courts to
the Supreme Court, the judgments or decrees of the Appellate Courts
shall be final, subject, however, to the following exceptions: (1) In
case a majority of the judges qf the Appellate Court or of any branch
thereof shall be of opinion that a case (regardless of the amount involved) decided by them involves a question of such importance, either
on account of principal or collateral interests, as that it should be
passed upon by the Supreme Court, they may in such case grant leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court on petition of parties to the cause, in
which case the said Appellate Court shall certify to the Supreme Court
the grounds of granting said appeal. (2) In any such case as is hereinbefore made nnal in the said Appellate Courts it shall be competent
for the Supreme Court to grant leave to appeal for its review and determination with the same power and authority in the case, and with
like effect, as if it had been carried by appeal to the said Supreme
Court: Provided, however, that in actions ea: oontractu (exclusive of
actions involving a penalty) and in all cases sounding in damages the
judgment, exclusive of costs, shall be more than fifteen hundred dollars
($1,500.00), or in cases in which the judgment is against the plaintiff
and there is issued by the Appellate Court, or by one of the judges
thereof in vacation, a certificate to the effect that there is fairly involved in the claim of the plaintiff more than fifteen hundred dollars
($1,500.00). And provided also, that application under this Act to the
Supreme Court to cause it to grant leave to appeal‘ for its review and
determination shall be made on or before twenty (20) days before
the first day of the succeeding term of said Supreme Court: Provided,
fifty (50) days shall have intervened between the day on which a rehearing in the Appellate Court shall have been denied or the day on
which the leave to apply for a rehearing shall have expired without any
such application having been made, and the first day of such succeeding

term of said court. But if less than fifty (50) days shall have inter- .

vened as aforesaid, then such application shall be made on or before
twenty (20) days before the first day of thesecond term of the Supreme
Court succeeding the day on which a rehearing in the Appellate Court
shall have been denied or the day upon which the leave to apply for
a rehearing shall have expired without any such application having been
made, otherwise said power of the Supreme Court to review the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court shall cease to exist.

§ 76. No
appeal shall be taken to the Supreme or Appellate Court after the expiration of ninety days from the entry of the order, decree, judgment
or other determination complained of; but, notice of appeal may be
filed after the expiration of said ninety days, and within the period of

one year, by order of the reviewing court, upon motion and notice
to adverse parties, and upon a showing by affidavit that there is merit
in appel1ant’s claim for an appeal and that the delay was not due to
appellant’s culpable negligence. Where an appeal is perfected or allowed more than thirty days after the entry of any order, decree, judgment or other determination in any action, (or when an appeal is perfected within said 30 days, and no supersedeas bond is filed within said
30 days, or within such further extended time as the trial court shall
have allowed within such thirty days, as provided in section 82 of this
Act,) the reversal or modification of such order, decree, judgment or
other determination shall not affect the right, title or interest in or to
any real or personal property of any person, not a party to such action,
acquired after the entry of such order, decree, judgment or other determination but before such appeal operates as a supersedeas under the
provisions of this Act; nor shall such reversal or modification affect any
right of any person not a party to such action under or by virtue of
any certificate of sale issued before such appeal operates as a supersedeas,
pursuant to a sale based on such order, decree, judgment or other determination. Where the appellant was an infant or non compos mentis
or under duress at the time of such entry, the period of disability shall
be excluded from the computation of the said periods of limitation; but
such exclusion shall not apply to, nor affect rights acquired in any such
property or certificate of sale, as in this section hereinbefore set forth,
before such appeal operates as a supersedeas, when the appeal is perfected
or allowed more than thirty days after the entry of such order, decree,
judgment or other determination.

(2) An appeal shall be deemed perfected when the notice of appeal
shall be filed in the lower court. After being duly perfected no appeal
shall be dismissed without notice, and no step other than that by which
the appeal is perfected shall be deemed jurisdictional.

§ 77. Appeals shall lie to the Appellate or Supreme Court, in
cases where any form of review may be allowed by law, to revise the final
judgments, orders or decrees of the Circuits Courts, the Superior Court
of Cook County, the County Courts, the City Courts and other courts
whose judgments, orders and decrees are reviewable therein, under such
limitations and conditions as may be imposed by law and subject to
such rules of court as may be established and promulgated under this chapter. An order granting a new trial shall be deemed to be a final
order, but no appeal may be taken therefrom, except on leave granted
by the reviewing court, or by a judge thereof in vacation within thirty
days after the entry of the order, on motion and notice to adverse
parties.

(2) Leave to appeal shall first be obtained only where such leave
is expressly required by law.

§ 78. Whenever an interlocutory order or decree is entered
granting an injunction, or overruling a motion to dissolve the same, or
enlarging the scope of an injunction order, or appointing a receiver, or
giving other or further powers or property to a receiver already appointed,

an appeal may be taken therefrom to the Appellate Court: Provided,
that such appeal is taken and the record is filed in said Appellate Court
within thirty days from the entry of such interlocutory order or decree,
and provided further that the time for filing such record may be
extended by an order of the Appellate Court _or by a judge thereof in
vacation. The force and effect of such interlocutory order or decree and
the proceedings in the court below shall not be stayed during the pendency of such appeal, except upon order of the Appellate Court or a
judge thereof in vacation. The party taking such appeal shall give bond,
to be approved by the clerk or the judge of the court below, to secure
costs in the Appellate Court. Upon the filing of the record in the
Appellate Court the same shall there be at once docketed, and shall be
ready for hearing under the rules of said court, taking precedence of
other cases in said court. Upon such appeal the Appellate Court may
afhrm, modify or reverse such interlocutory order or decree, and shall
direct such proceedings to be had in the court below as the justice of
the case may require. If such appeal is dismissed, the Appellate Court
may allow to the attorney for appellee a reasonable solicitor’s fee, not
to exceed one hundred dollars, to be taxed as part of the costs of the
appeal. N o appeal shall be taken from the order entered by said
Appellate Court on any such appeal. ~

§ 79. The Supreme Court
may, by general rules, regulate and determine the practice and procedure
by which cases shall be reviewed in the Appellate and Supreme Court,
including the joinder, severance, adding, dropping and substitution of
parties, the time within which any Act may be done, the manner of giving notices, the specifications of grounds of appeal, cross appeals and
the specification of grounds therefor, hearings and rehearings, the form,
contents, filing and service of records and briefs, and all other matters
of practice in connection with the review of cases.

§ 80. No formal exception need be taken to any
ruling or action of the court in any matter or proceeding, in order to
make such ruling or action a ground for review.

§ 81. In all cases where a
judgment, order or decree, reviewable by. the Appellate or Supreme
Court, shall be rendered in any court of record, in any case or proceeding whatever, against two or more persons, either one of said persons

shall be permitted to take an appeal and for that purpose shall be per- ‘

mitted to use the names of all of said persons, if necessary; but no costs
shall be taxed against any person who shall not join in said appeal. The
right heretofore possessed by any person not a party to the record to
review a judgment or decree by writ of error “shall be preserved by notice
of appeal.

§ 82. An appeal to the
Appellate or Supreme Court shall operate as a supersedeas only if and
when the appellant, after notice duly served, shall give and file a bond,
in a reasonable amount, to secure the adverse party. If the bond is
given before the record is filed in the reviewing court, the amount and
terms thereof shall be fixed and the security approved by the trial judge
or his successor in office, or where this is impossible because of the

absence from the district, sickness or other disability of such judge
then by any other judge of said court, and the bond shall be filed in
said court; if the bond is given after the record is filed in the reviewing court, the amount and terms thereof shall be fixed and the security
approved by the reviewing court or a judge thereof, and the bond shall
be filed in said reviewing court. If the appeal is from a judgment or
decree for the recovery of money, the condition of the bond shall be
for the prosecution of such appeal and the ‘payment of the judgment,
interest, damages and costs in case the judgment is affirmed. In all
other cases the condition shall be directed by the court with reference
to the character of the judgment, order or decree appealed from. If

the order, determination, decision, judgment or decree complained of,
and if bond is given and filed within thirty (30) days after such entry,
or within such further extended time as the trial court may allow within
such thirty (30) days, the notice of appeal shall, upon the approval of
the bond, operate as a supersedeas. After the expiration of such thirty
(30) days, no appeal shall operate as a supersedeas except upon express
order of the reviewing court.

(2) The court may by order authorize the clerk to approve the
security offered upon such bond. r

shall fix, the issuing of any mandate until the time for filing a petition
in the Supreme Court for leave to appeal shall have expired or if such
petition shall have been nled within the proper time, until said petition
shall have been granted or refused. Whenever leave to appeal shall have
been granted, the issuing or enforcement of any mandate of the Appellate Court pursuant to its judgment, or of any judgment entered in any
court, or standing affirmed in any court, pursuant to the mandate of the
Appellate Court, may be stayed by the Supreme Court upon such terms
as it shall fix.

§ 83. Every court, judge or clerk
of court shall have power to examine on oath the person offering to become surety on any bond, concerning his property and the sumciency of

court, judge or clerk shall direct the surety to appear to be examined at
a designated place and time not more than five days after service of
notice of such direction upon the party or his attorney, giving or offering to give such bond. If such surety shall not appear at the time fixed
in such order, or shall be found insufficient, the bond,. given or offered,

or adjudged that the case was wrongly appealed to such court, it shall be
the duty of such court to direct the clerk to transmit the transcript and
all files therein with the order of transfer to the clerk of the proper
court. On the receipt of such record the clerk shall at once file the same
and the case shall then proceed as if the same had been taken there from
the inferior court. Any bond executed in any case which may be transferred as aforesaid, shall be binding on the parties thereto with the same
force and effect as if given in a case taken directly to the court to which
the case was transferred.

§ 87. When any
appeal is dismissed or any judgment, decree or order is affirmed for want
of prosecution, the reviewing court shall enter judgment against the
appellant for not less than fifty dollars damages and for not more than
ten per cent of the amount recovered below when such percentage
exceeds fifty dollars.

§ 88. When an appeal is dismissed, or a judgment, order or
decree is afhrmed, execution may issue and other proceedings may be had
thereon in all respects, as if no appeal had been taken upon the filing of
the mandate of the reviewing court in the ofhce of the clerk of the court
from which the case was originally removed.

(2) When any cause is remanded for a new trial the reviewing
court shall issue its mandate reversing and remanding such cause
directly to such trial court; and upon the filing of such mandate in
the trial court, the cause or proceeding shall be reinstated therein, upon»
ten days’ notice being given to the adverse party or his attorney.
Service of such notice may be made upon any party personally, whether
found within or without the state, or upon the attorney of record of
such party in the trial court in any manner provided for service of
papers upon attorneys, or as the trial court may direct.

(3) No new trial shall be had by reason of the reversal of any
judgment, order or decree, unless the mandate shall be filed in the trial
court within one year after final determination by the reviewing court.

§ 89. If any
final determination of any cause or proceeding tried without a jury,
except as to equitable issues, shall be made by the Appellate Court, as

the result wholly or in part of the finding of the facts, concerning the matter-in controversy, different from the finding of the court from which

such cause or proceeding was brought by appeal, it shall be the duty of
such Appellate Court to indicate in- its opinion or in its final order,
judgment or decree, the facts as found; and the statement of such facts
by the Appellate Court shall be final and conclusive as to all matters of
fact in controversy in such cause or proceeding. If the facts found by
the Appellate Court sufficiently appear in the opinion or in the final
order, judgment or decree, or from an examination of the two, no such
final order, judgment or decree shall be reversed for failure to recite
such facts. .

§ 90. Notice of the taking of an appeal
shall be given to the appellee or his attorney in such manner as may be
provided by rules.

§ 91. The
form and substance of process, in the Supreme or Appellate Courts shall
be prescribed by rules made by the Supreme Court and shall be uniform
as far as practicable. _

(2) Such process shall be executed by the oflicer or person to
whom it is directed or to whom it is given for service, in any county or

(c) Order or permit the record to be amended by correcting errors
or by adding matters which should have been included;

(d) Permit such further testimony to be taken in or presented
to the reviewing court as it may deem necessary, where evidence has been
erroneously excluded or where there has been an omission of proof at
the trial of some fact which, under the circumstances of the case, may
subsequently beproved without involving any question for a jury and
without substantial injustice to either party.

(e) Draw inferences of fact;

(f) Give any judgment and make any order which ought to have
been given or made, and make such other and further orders and grant
such relief, including a remandment, a partial reversal, the order of a
partial new trial, the entry of a remittitur, or the issuance of execution,
as the case may "require. (2) When the reviewing court shall give final judgment or decree and issue execution thereon, a certificate or certified copy of such
judgment or decree may be filed in the office of the recorder of deeds of
any county in which real estate of the defendant in such execution is
situated and, in case of registered land, a memorial thereof entered upon
the register of the last certificate of the title to be affected, and the
judgment or decree shall thereupon have the same force and effect as a

lien upon said real estate, as if such judgment or decree had been originally rendered by a court of record in said county.

(3) a. Any error of law aEecting the judgment, decree or order
appealed from may be brought up for review in any civil case.

b. Error of fact, in that the judgment, decree or order appealed
from is not sustained by the evidence or is against the Weight of the
evidence, may be brought up for review in any civil case: Provided,
that, except as to equitable issues, the Supreme Court shall re-examine
cases brought to it by appeal from the Appellate Courts, as to questions
of law only. I

any of the material facts which ought to appear in such aflidavit are
known only to persons whose affidavits afliant is unable to procure, by
reason of hostility or otherwise, naming such persons and showing
why their afiidavits cannot be procured, and what affiant believes they
would testify to if sworn-, with his reasons for such belief, the court
may make such order as may be just, either granting or refusing the
application for summary judgment, or making an order for a continuance to permit aflidavits to be obtained, or for submitting interrogatories to or taking the depositions of any of the persons so named, or
for producing papers or documents in the possession of such persons
or furnishing sworn copies thereof. The interrogatories and sworn

which are, or which have been, in his possession or power, relating to
the merits of the matter in question in said cause. If such order shall
be made, as to any or all of said documents, the documents embraced
in such order shall be listed, with suflicient descriptions for identi13ca—
tion, in two schedules, (1) all those which the party is willing to
"produce, and the name and address of the party in whose possession or
-control such document now is; (2) all those which the party is unwilling to produce, with a statement of the reasons for his objection to
production of the same and with the name and address of the party
in whose possession or control such document now is. Documents pro-duced by the opposite party may be introduced in evidence by the
party demanding them without further proof of genuineness.

(2) As to documents listed in schedule 1, the other party may
inspect and obtain copies of the same at any time not inconvenient for
the party having possession thereof, and if leave so to do is unreasonably
refused by the party listing it or by any other party at the instance of or
fby collusion with the party listing it, a motion may be made for an

order that the party listing such document shall be non-suited or his
declaration or bill dismissed, or that any pleading or part thereof filed
by him shall be stricken out and judgment rendered accordingly, or that
he may be debarred from any particular claim, defense, recoupment,
set-off, counterclaim or replication respectingwhich discovery is sought,
or an order of attachment as for contempt of court may be issued.

document shall be non-suited or his complaint dismissed, or that any

rendered accordingly, or that he may be debarred from maintaining any
particular claim, defense. recoupment, set-off, or counterclaim or replication, respecting which discovery is sought.

(4) N 0 document not listed shall be admissible in evidence at the
instance of the party failing to list it, unless it shall be made to appear

and reasonable belief of the party that such document did not relate to
the cause or matter in litigation.

_ (5) If any document listed in schedule 1 is not produced when
reasonable -demand is made for the same, such document shall not be
admissible in evidence at the instance of the party listing it, (1) where
it is in the possession or control of such party or (2) where it is in
possession or the control of some other party unless the court is satisfied
that the refusal to produce was not due in any degree to the wilful
connivance of the party listing it.

(6) N 0 document listed in schedule 2 shall be admissible in
evidence at the instance of the party so listing it, unless by leave of
court.

(7) Supplemental lists of documents may be filed as further
documents are discovered by the party who has already filed a list,
each supplemental list being supported by an amdavit stating facts
showing in detail why the documents listed therein were not listed
earlier, and if the court shall be of opinion that the party has acted in
good faith and that there was reasonable ground for the delay, the
documents so listed may be introduced in evidence at the instance of the
party so listing them on such terms as may be just. And such supplemental lists of documents shall be nled as additional documents shall

‘ come into the party’s possession after the date of the order and before

trial.

(8) Any party may at any time move for an order directing any
other party or person to show cause why he should not produce specided
documents. relating to the merits of the matter in question in said
cause. for inspection and to be copied or photographed, where no list of
documents has been demanded or where such documents have not been

listed under section 1 of this rule, or produce for inspection or to be
photographed articles or property relative to the merits of the said
matter, such motion to be supported by affidavits showing that such
document or article is in the possession or control of the other party. On
the return or hearing of the order to show cause the court may make
such order as to discovery or inspection as may be just, and, if the other
party claims that the document or article is not in his possession or
control he may be ordered to submit to examination in open court or
by deposition regarding the locating of such document or article.

, (9) The court, on the application of any party to an action, also
may enter an order requiring any other party to state by affidavit
whether any one or more specific documents, to be specified in the application, is or are, or has or have at any time been in his possession or
power, and if not then in his possession, when he parted with the
same, and what has become thereof. Such application shall be made
upon an affidavit stating that in the belief of the deponent the party
against whom the application is made has, or has at some time had, in

, his possession or power the document or documents specified in the

application, and that they relate to the matter in question in the case
or matter, or to some of them. .

vacated, shall have the like time to file and serve his complaint, answer,

§ 104. Rule 10. Either
party may exhibit to the other or to his attorney at any time before the
trial. any paper material to the action, and request an admission in
writing of its genuineness. If the adverse party or his attorney fail to
give the admission within four days after the request, and the delivery
to him of a copy thereof, if such copy be required, and if the party
exhibiting the paper be afterward required to prove its genuinene~ss, and
the same be finally proved or admitted on the trial, the expense of
proving the same, including a reasonable counsel fee for the time and
attention devoted thereto, to be ascertained and summarily taxed at the
trial, shall be paid by the party refusing the admission, unless it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the court, that there were good reasons
for the refusal, and an attachment or execution may be granted to enforce the payment of such expense.

(2) Any party, by notice in writing, given not later than ten
days before trial, may call on any other party to admit, for the purposes
of the cause, matter or issue only, any specific fact or facts mentioned
in such notice, which can be fairly admitted without qualification or
explanation as stated therein. In case of refusal or neglect to admit the
same within four days after service of such notice, or within such
further time as may be allowed by the court or a judge, the expenses
incurred in proving such fact or facts, including a reasonable counsel
fee for the time and attention devoted thereto, must be ascertained at
the trial and paid by the party so neglecting or refusing, whatever the

result of the cause, matter or issue may be, unless at the trial or hearing,
the court or a judge certify that the refusal to admit was reasonable,
or unless the court or a judge, at any time, shall order or direct otherwise. Any admission made in pursuance of such notice is to be deemed
to be made only for the purposes of the particular cause, matter or
issue, and not as an admission to be used against the party on any
other occasion or in favor of any person other than the party giving the
notice. The court or a judge, at any time, may allow any party to
amend or withdraw any admission so made on such terms as may be
just.

(3) When any public records are to be used as evidence, the party
intending to so use them may prepare a copy, synopsis or abstract
of them in so far as they are to be used, and may seasonably present
such copy, synopsis or abstract to the adverse party by notice in writing, and such copy, synopsis or abstract shall thereupon be admissible
in evidence as admitted facts in the case if otherwise admissible except
in so far as its inaccuracy shall be pointed out under oath by the adverse party in an afiidavit filed and served within ten days after service
of such notice and not less than four days before the case shall be
called for trial.

§ 105. Rule. 11. Any party
to a civil action may cause to be taken, on oral or written interrogatories
by deposition before trial, in the manner provided by law, the testimony
of any other party or of any other person, which is relevant to the prosecution or defense of the action, and, if hostile, such person may be examined as though under cross-examination. *

its members president and one secretary and treasurer. The board shall
audit, annually, the accounts of its secretary and treasurer and shall

The board shall conduct three examinations an~nually,—In Chicago

on the third Tuesday in March and in July, and in Springfield on the
third Tuesday in November. Such examinations shall be conducted by
printed interrogatories, shall be uniform and shall be supervised by the
members as a body, a majority of the board constituting a quorum. The
board shall certify to the court at each term those who have met the
requirements for admission to the bar and the applicants so certified
shall appear in person before this court and shall be admitted to the
bar on motion in open court.

Each applicant for examination shall present. to the Board of Law

consist of a diploma showing graduation from an accredited four-year
high school. or a certificate of the registrar of the University of Illinois,
or other college or university of equal credit, that the applicant is entitled to enter such college or university, with further proof that this

law. Such applicant must further show that he has within six years

next prior to applying for examination pursued for a period of three
years, during at least thirty-six weeks in each year, a course of law studies covering the law of real and personal property, persons and domestic
relations, torts, contracts, partnership, bailments, negotiable instruments, agency, suretyship, wills, corporations, equity jurisprudence,
crimes, conflict of laws, evidence, common law and equity pleading, the
Federal and State constitutions, and legal ethics, that such law studies
have been pursued in an established law school accredited by the Board
of Law Examiners or under the personal tuition of one or more licensed
attorneys, and that the applicant, if studying under such tuition, has
pursued said studies at least thirty-six weeks in each year and has submitted to regular and satisfactory examinations by such attorney during
said period upon each subject. Students pursuing studies under the
tuition of an attorney shall take the current annual examinations hereinafter required. Proof of legal education shall consist of the affidavit
of the applicant and the certincate of the secretary or one of the professors of the law school showing personal attendance at such law
school, or the affidavit of- the attorney or attorneys under whose tuition
such studies have been pursued; or, if in consequence of the death or
absence from the State of such attorney or attorneys, his or their aflidavit
cannot be procured, such proof may be made by aiiidavit of any credible
witness having knowledge of the facts.

For those beginning the study of law after July 1, 1924, proof of
general education shall consist of a diploma showing graduation from a
four—year high school, or other preparatory school, whose graduates are
admitted on such diploma to the freshmen class of any college or university where the requirements for admission are equal to ‘those required
by the University of Illinois, or the certificate of the registrar of such a
college or university that the applicant is entitled to enter same, and a
certificate of a member of the faculty of a college or university accredited
by the Board of Law Examiners showing completion of at least seventytwo weeks of general college work, or the applicant, in lieu of such
certificate, must pass an examination to be given by or under the direction and supervision of the Board of Law Examiners in a course of
studies to be approved by said board as the equivalent of seventy-two
weeks of college study. The board by rule may recommend certain
subjects which they will regard as such equivalent but they shall not
specifically require any particular group of studies. The high school
education or its equivalent shall be completed before the college studies
begin, and the college education, or its equivalent, shall be completed
before the law studies begin: Provided, however, that as to all applicants
who begin the study of law after July 1, 1924, and prior to July 1, 1926,
only thirty-six weeks of college study or its equivalent shall be required.

For those beginning the study of law after July 1, 1924, proof of
legal education shall be made in one of the modes following:

First, by a certificate from an established law school or schools
accredited by the Board of Law Examiners, showing that the applicant
has pursued a course of law studies in such law school or schools of at
least twelve hundred class room hours, and has passed a satisfactory
examination in each of the law studies required for graduation by such

law school or schools. Such examinations shall include the law subjects
hereinbefore enumerated. The board shall not, however, give credit for
more than four hundred thirty-two class room hours in any period of
thirty-six weeks.

Second, by showing that the applicant has in good faith, while
actually engaged in the office and under the personal tuition of a licensed
attorney or attorneys in active practice, pursued for a period of four
years during at least thirty-six weeks in each year, a course of law
studies to be prescribed by the Board of Law Examiners as the equivalent
of such law school course. Such applicant shall submit to and satisfactorily pass an examination by the Board of Law Examiners once each
year during the first three years of such law office study. Proof of such
study shall be made by an affidavit of such licensed attorney or attorneys
showing that the applicant has pursued the course of studies herein
required and has passed satisfactory examinations in each subject. If
in consequence of the death or absence from the State of such attorney
or attorneys his or their affidavit cannot be procured, such proof, subject
to the approval of the Board of Law Examiners, may be made by an
amdavit of any credible witness having personal -knowledge of the facts.

Third, if an applicant pursued his course of law studies partly in
such accredited law school and partly under the tuition of such licensed
attorney or attorneys, he shall be allowed credit for studies in such law
school upon presentation of a certificate therefrom showing the studies
he has taken therein by personal attendance, the number of class room
hours and of weeks of law study pursued, and that he has satisfactorily
passed examinations in such studies. He shall be allowed credit for such
studies as he pursues under the tuition of a licensed attorney or attorneys
when proof is made as above provided. Such an applicant shall pursue
his law studies for a period of four years during at least thirty-six
weeks in each year.

If an applicant for admission to the bar shall be unsuccessful at an
examination given by the Board of Law Examiners, he shall, before
taking a subsequent examination, furnish evidence satisfactory to the
board that he has diligently pursued the study of law since his last
examination. An applicant who has been rejected at a fifth examination
shall not again be admitted to an examination, unless the Board of Law
Examiners, in its discretion, shall permit him to do so.

Where a licensed attorney requests admission to the bar upon a
license showing his admission as an attorney at law in another state or
country he must present to the board proof that he has been admitted
to practice in the highest court of such state or country and that he has
actually remained in said state or country and practiced in the courts of
record as an attorney at law for at least five years, specifying the name
of the place or places in which he has so practiced. Such proof shall
be supported by a certificate from a judge of the highest court in the
state or country certifying that he has been so admitted, has so practiced,
and is a man of good character, such certificate to be certified by the
clerk of the court and sealed with the seal of the court; provided, however, where the requirements for admission to the bar of such state or
country require less than two years of law study, such attorney shall

furnish proof as above that he has actually practiced in the courts of
record of such state or country for at least eight years. Where the requirements for admission to the bar in such state or country at the time
of the applicant’s admission therein are equivalent to the requirements
in this State in effect at the time of the application for admission here,
the board may recommend for admission to the bar of this State an
attorney licensed in such other state or country. A

At the October term in each year there shall be appointed by th
court a Committee on Character and Fitness in each of the Appellate
Court districts of the State, consisting of not less than three attorneys
at law and the member or members of the Board of Law Examiners
appointed for the respective districts, to which shall be referred all applications for admission to the bar of this State, the members of such
committee to continue in office until ‘their successors are appointed. The
committee shall require the attendance before it or a member thereof of
each applicant with the affidavit of at least three practicing attorneys

which such applicant resides, testifying to the good character and general
fitness to practice law of such applicant. said affidavits to set forth in
detail the facts upon which the ‘opinion is based.

resident of the State of Illinois, and twenty—one years of age or over.. He
must be able to speak and write readily and intelligently the English
language, and must give evidence to the Committee on Character and
Fitness that. he understands and believes in the righteousness of the
principals underlying the Constitutions of the State and of the United
States, and that he has such other qualifications as to character and
general fitness as, in the opinion of the committee, justify his admission
to the bar. N 0 person shall be admitted to practice law in this State
who shall not furnish a certificate of general fitness to practice law
from the Committee on Character and Fitness of his district, a certificate
of good moral character from a court of record of the county of his
residence, a sworn statement showing his full name, age, birthplace, residence, and length of residence in such place; if born in a foreign country,

specific charges, giving time, place and acts of misconduct with reasonable certainty, signed by the Attorney General, a State’s attorney, the
president and secretary of a regular organized bar association, either incorporated or unincorporated, or any person aggrieved by the misconduct
of the attorney charged. Where the information is signed by such
aggrieved person he shall verify it by an affidavit upon which perjury
can be assigned, and such aggrieved person must be represented, in the
proceeding so instituted, by an attorney whose name then appears upon
the roll of the attorneys of this court. When the information sha1l.be
