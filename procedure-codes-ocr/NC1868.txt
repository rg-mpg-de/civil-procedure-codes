continued by the proper parties, within a time to be fixed
by the Court,- not less than six months, nor exceeding one
year from the granting of the order.

existing at the ratification of this act, as to those commenced
subsequently thereto. ’

§ 65. The Court either between the terms, or at a regular term,
according to the nature of the controversy, under the regulations contained in this Act, may determine any controversy
before it, when it can. be done without prejudice to the rights
of others, or by saving their rights; but when a complete
determination of the controversy cannot be had Without the
presence of other parties, the Court must cause them to be
brought in.

And when in an action for the recovery of real or personal
property, a person not~a party to the action, but having an
interest in the subject thereof, makes application to the Court
to be made a party, it may order him to be brought in by
the proper amendment.

A defendant against whom an action is pending upon .a
contract, or for specific real or personal property, may at any

' time before answer, upon affidavit, that a person not a party
to the action, and without collusion with him, makes against
him a demand for the same- debt or property, upon due
notice to such person and the adverse party, apply to the
Court for an order to substitute 'such person in his place,

and discharge him from .. liability to either party, oni his

direct; and the Court may, in its discretion, make the order. 2‘

§ 83. Where the person on whom the service of the summons is
to be made, cannot, after due diligence, be found within the

appears that acause of action exists against the defendant in
respect to whom the service is to be made, or that he is a pros per party to an action relating to real property in this State,
such Court or Judge may grant an order that the service be
made by the publication of a summons in either of the following cases:
1. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, and has
property within .the State, or the cause of action arose
therein;

2. Where the defendant, being a resident of this State,
has departed therefrom, with intent to defraud his creditors,
Or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself concealed therein with a like intent;

'3. Where he is not a resident of this State, but has property therein, and the Court has jurisdiction of the subject
of the action. '

4. Where the subject of the action is real or personal property in this State, and the defendant has or claims alien or interest, actual or- contingent, therein, or the relief demanded consists wholly or partly, in excluding the defendant fi'om any lien or interest therein.

5. Where the action is for divorce, in the cases prescribed
by law.

§ 84. The order must direct the publication in any one or two .
newspapers to be designated as most likely to give notice
to the person to be served, and for such length of time as
may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week for
six weeks.- In case of publication the Court or Judge must
also direct a copy of the summons and complaint to be forthwith deposited in' the post office, directed to the person to
be served, at his place of residence, unless it appears that
such residence is neither known to the party making the
application, nor can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him. When publication is ordered, personal ser.

vice of a copy of the summons and complaint, out of theState, is equivalent to publication and deposit in the postoflice. '

§ 85. The defendant against whom publication is ordered, or his.
representatives, on application and suflicient cause shown at
any time before judgment, must be allowed to defend the
action; and, except in an action for divorce, the defendant
against whom publication is ordered, or his representatives,
may in like manner, upon good cause shown, be allowed to
defend after judgment, or at any time within one year after
notice thereof, and within five years after its rendition, on
such terms as may be just; and if the defence be successful
‘ and the judgment, or any part thereof, have been collected,
or otherwiSe enfOrced, such restitution may thereupon be
compelled as the court may direct; but the title to prOperty
sold under such judgment to a purchaser in good faith shall i
not be thereby affected. And in all cases where publication
is made, the complaint must be first filed, and the summons
as published must state the time and place of such tiling.

§ 86. In actions for the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate,
already instituted, or hereafter to be instituted, if any party
' having any interest in or lien upon such mprtgaged premises,

is unknown to the plaintiff, and the residence cf such party
cannot, with reasonable diligence, be' ascertained by him,
and such fact shall be made to appear by affidavit, to the
court, such court may grant an order that the summons be
served on such unknown party by publishing the same for
six weeks once in each week successively, in one newspaper
’ printed in Raleigh, and in a newspaper printed in the county
where the premises lie, if there be any, which publication
shall be equivalent to a personal service on such unknown

party.
§ 87. Where the action is against two or more defendants, and

b

the summons is served on one or more of them, but not on
all them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows:

1. If the action be against defendants jointly indebted
upon contract, he may proceed against the defendants served,

‘ unless .the court otherwise direct; and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus
jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced against
the joint property of all, and the separate pr0perty of the
defendants served, and if they are subject to arrest, against
the persons of the defendants served; or

2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he
may proceed against the defendants served, in the same
manner as if they were the only defendants. .

3. If all the defendants have been served, judgment may
be taken against any or either of them severally, when the
plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against such defendant or defendants if the action had been against them .or
any of them alone.

4. If the name of one or more partners, shall, for any
cause have been omitted in any action in which judgment
shall have passed against the'defendants named in the summons, and such omission shall not have been pleaded in
such action, the plaintiff in case the judgment therein shall
remain unsatisfied, may by action recover of Such partner
separately, upon proving his joint liability, notwithstanding
he may not have been named in the original action; but the
plaintiff shall have satisfaction of only one judgment rendered for the same cause of action.

§ 88. In the cases in which service by publication is allowed,
the summons shall be deemed served at the expiration of
the time prescribed by the order of publication.

§ 89. Proof of the service of the summons and of the complaint
or notice, if any accompanying the same, must be:

1. By the certificate of the sheriff or other proper officer.

2. In case of publication, the aiiidavit of the printer, or:

his foreman, or principal clerk, showing the same, and an
aiiidavit of a deposit of a copy of the summons in the post
office as required by law, if the same shall have been
deposited; or

3. The written admission of the defendant.

In case of service otherwise than by publication, the

certificate or admission must state the time and place of
service.

§ 90. -From the time of the service of the summons in a civil
action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court
is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have cOntrol
of all the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance
of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

In an action affecting the title to real property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, or whenever a warrant of attachment, under chapter
tour, of title ten, of this Code, shall be issued, or at any
time afterwards, the plaintiff, or a defendant when he sets
'up an affirmative cause of action in his answer and demands
substantive relief, at the time of filing his answer, or at any.
time afterwards, if the same be intended to affect real estate,
may file with the clerk of each county in which the property
is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action, and
the description of the property in that county affected thereby; and if the action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage,
such notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and
must contain the date of the mortgage, the parties thereto,
and the time and place of recording the same. From the
time of filing only shall the pendency of the action be conStructive notice to a purchaser or incumbrancer of the property affected thereby; and every person whose conveyance
or incumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently
recorded, shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer, and shall be bound by all proceedings taken after

the filing of such notice, to the same extent as if he were
made a party to the action. For the purposes of this section, "
an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of
filing such notice; provided, however, that such notice shall
be of no avail unless it shall be followed by the first publication of the summons on an order therefor, or by the personal
service thereof on a‘ defendant within sixty days after such
filing. And the court in which_ the said action was commenced may, in its discreticm, at any time after the action °
shall besettled, discontinued, or abated, as is provided in section number sixty-four, on application of any person
aggrieved, and on good cause shown, and on such notice as
shall be directed or approved by the court, order the notice
authorized by this section to be canceled of record by the
clerk ofany county in whose office the same may have been
iiled or recorded; and such cancellation shall be made by an
indorsement to that effect on the margin of the record, which
shall refer to the order, and for which the clerk shall be
entitled to a fee of twenty-five cents.

Q

CHAPTER VI.

GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING.

§ 116. Every pleading in a court of record, must be subscribed
by the party or his attorney; and when any pleading is verified, every subsequent pleading, except a demurrer, must be
verified also.

§ 117. The verification must be to the effect that the same is true
to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those
matters stated on information and belief, and as to those
matters he believes it to be true; and must be by affidavit of
the paity, or if there be several parties united in interest,

and pleading together, by one at least of such parties
acquainted with the facts, if such party be within the county where the attorney resides, andcapable of making the
aliidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or
attorney, if the action or defence be founded upon a written
instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent or attorney, or if all
the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the pleading is verified by any other person than the party, he shall
set forth in the affidavit his knowledge, or the grounds of
his belief on the subject, and the reasons why it is not made
by the party. When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof; and when the
State, or any ofIicer thereof in its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with the
facts. The verification may be omitted when an admission
‘of the truth of the allegation might subject the party to
prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used in a
criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact
admitted or alleged in such pleading.

§ 118. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall
deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which if the pleading is verified, must be verided by his own oath, or that of
his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of
such agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be
true,L or be preCluded from giving evidence thereof. The
court or the Judge thereof, may order a further account
when the one delivered is defective; and the court may in

all cases, order a bill of particulars of the claim of either
party to be furnished.

§ 119. In the construction of a-pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed,
with a view of substantial justice between theparties.

§ 120. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleadin g, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person‘ aggrieved thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading are so
indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge
or defence is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment. '

§ 121. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court
or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or
determination .may be stated to have been duly given or
made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts eonferring jurisdiction. .

§ 122. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing
such performance; but it may be stated generally that the
party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. In an action or defence founded upon an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient
for the party to give a copy of the instrument, and to state
that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse party, a
specified sum which he claims. , p ' i .

§ 123. In pleading a private statute or a right derived therefrom,
it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute, by its title and
the day of its ratification, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof.

§ 124. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose
of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose: but it
shall be sufiicient to state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or spoken.

§ 125. In the actions mentioned in the last- section, the defendant
may in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter
charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances to
reduce' the amount of damages; and whether he prove the
justihcation or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances.

§ 126. The plaintifi may unite in the same complaint several
causes of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal, or equitable, or both, where they all
arise out of,

1. The same transaction; or transactions connected with
the same subject of action; .

2. Contract express or implied; or

3. Injuries with or without force, to. person and property
or either; or

4. Injuries to character; or

5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for the withholding thereof; and the rents and profits '
of the same; or ° _

6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without
damages for the Withholdin g thereof; or

. 7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by
3 operatidn of law. '

But thetauses of action so united must all belong to one
of these classes, and except in actions for the foreclosure of
mortgages, must affect all the parties to the action, and not
require different places of trial, and must be separately
stated. In actions to foreclose mortgages, the court shall
have power to adjudge and direct the payment by the mort'gagor of any residue of the mortgage debt that may remain
unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises, in cases
in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the
debt secured by such mortgage; and if the mortgage debt
‘ be secured by the convenant or obligation of any person
other than the mortgagor, the plaintiff may make such person a party to the action, and the court may adjudge payment of the residue of such debt remaining unsatisfied after
a sale of the mortgaged premises, against such other person,
and may enforce such' judgment as in other cases.

§ 127. Every material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section ninety-seven, and
every material allegation of new matter in the answer, constituting a counter claim, not controverted by the reply, as
prescribed in section one hundred and one, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But the allegation of
new matter in the answer, not relating‘to a counter-claim,
or of new matter in reply, is to be deemed controverted by

the adverse party as, upon a direct denial or avoidance, as
the case may require.

CHAPTER VII.

MISTAKES IN PLEADINGS AND AMENDMENTS.

§ 128. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proof- shall be deemed material, unless it have actually

misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining
his action upon the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged
that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to
the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been
misled; and thereupon the Judge may order the pleading to
be amended upon such terms as shall be just.

§ 129. Where the variance is not material as provided in the last section, the Judge may direct the fact to be found according
to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment
without costs.

§ 130. Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or
defence to which the proof is directed is unprOved, not in
some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope
and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance
within the last sections, but a failure of proof.

§ 131. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of
course, without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any' time before the period for answering it expires: or it can be so amended at any time within
twenty days after the service of the answer or demurrer to
such pleading, unless it be made to appear to the court that
it was done for the purpose of delay, and the plaintiff or
defendant will thereby lose the beneEt of a term for which
the cause is or may be docketed for trial; and if it appear '
to the ,court or Judge that such amendment was made for
such purpose, the same may be stricken out, and such terms
imposed as to the court or Judge may seem just. In such
case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the
adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, the Judge
may, in his discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was
interposed in good faith, allow the party to plead over upon
such terms as may be just. It the demurrer be allowed for

the reason that several causes of action have been improperly
united, the Judge may, in his discretion, and upon such terms
as may be just, order the action to be divided into as many
actions as may be necessary to the proper determination of
the causes of action therein mentioned.

‘

§ 182. The court may, before, and the Judge may, after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may
be pr0per, amend any pleading process or proceeding, by
adding or striking out the name of any party; or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in
any other respect; or by inserting other allegations material
to the case; or when the amendment does not change substaintially the claim or defence, by conforming the pleading
or proceeding‘to the facts. proved.

§ 133. The Judge may likewise in his discretion, and upon such
terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be 'made,
or other act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or
by an order enlarge such time; and may also in his discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time within

one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judg- ment order or other proceeding taken against him through
his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, and
may supply an omission in any proceeding; and .whenever
any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any
respect to the provisions of this Code, the Judge, may in
like manner and upon like terms, permit an amendment of
such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto.

§ 134. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a
defendant, such defendant may be designated in any plead‘ ing (1' proceeding by name; and when his true name shall
be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended
accordingly.

§ 135. The Court and the Judge thereof, shall in every stage of
action, disregard any error of defect in the pleadings or
proceedings, which shall not affect the substantial rights of

the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed or
affected by reason of such error or defect. '

§ 186. The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed
on motion to make a supplemental complaint, answer or
reply, alleging facts material to the. case, occurring after the
former complaint, answer or reply, or of which the party
was ignorant when his former pleading was made, and either
party may, by leave of the Court in any pending or future
action, set up. by a supplemental pleading, the judgment or
decree of any Court of competent jurisdiction, rendered since
the commencement of such action, determining the matter
in controversy in said action or any part thereof, and if said
judgment be set up by the plaintiff, the same shall be Without prejudice to any provisional remedy theretofore issued or
other proceedings had, in said action, on his behalf.

CHAPTER 1.
JUDGMENT UPON FAILURE TO ANSWER," ac.

§ 216. A judgment is the final determination of the rights of
the parties in the action. ' 7

§ 217. Judgment may be had, if the defendant fail to answer the
complaint, as follows: i

1. In any action arising on contract for the recovery of
money only, the plaintiff may file with the clerk proof of
personal service of the summons and complaint on one or
more of the defendants, or of the summons according to the
provisions of section Seventy-six, and that no answer has
been filed. The clerk shall thereupon enter judgment for
the amount mentioned in the summons, against the defendant or defendants, or against one or more of several defen-‘
dants, in the cases provided for in section eighty-seven. But
if the complaint be not sworn to, and such action is on an
instrument for the payment of money only, the clerk, on its
productionto him, shall assess the amount (he to the plaintiff
thereon; and in other cases shall ascertain the amount which
the plaintiff is entitled to recover in such action, from his
examination, under oath, or other proof, and enter the judgment for the amount so assessedor ascertained. In case the
defendant give notice of appearance in the action, he shall
be -entitled to five days’ notice of the time and place of such
assessment. ‘

Where the defendant, by his answer in such action, shall
not deny the plaintiff’s claim, but shall set up a counterclaim, amounting to less than the plaintiff’s claim, judgment
may be had by the plaintiff for the excess of said claim over
the said counter-claim, in like manner in any such action,
upon the plaintiff’s filing with the clerk of the Court a statement admitting such counter claim, which statement shall
be annexed to and be a part of the judgment-roll.

2. In other actions the plaintiff may, upon the like proof,
apply to the Court, after the expiration of the time for
answering, for the relief demanded in the complaint. If the
taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary
to enable the Court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the Court may take the account or hear the
proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that

purpose. And where the action is for the recovery of money
only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages
for the Withholdin g thereof, the court may order the damages
to be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long
account be involved, by a reference as above provided. If
the defendant give notice of appearance in the action before
the expiration of the time for answering, he shall be entitled
to eight days’ notice of the time and place of application to
the Court for the relief demanded by the complaint.

3. In actions where the service of the summons was by
publication,“ the plaintiff may, in like manner, apply for
judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be
made of the demand mentioned in the complaint; and if the
defendant be not a resident (f the State must require the
plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath respecting any
payments that have been made to the plaintiii“, or to any one
for his use, on account of such demand, and may render
judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover.
Before rendering judgment the court may, in its discretion,
require. the plaintiff to cause to be tiled satisfactory security,
to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution of
any estate or effects which may be directed by such judgment
to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money
that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment,
in case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and
be admitted to defend the action, and shall succeed in such
defence.

§ 218. . If a demurrer, answer or reply be frivolous, the party prejudiced thereby, upon a previous notice of five days may
apply to the court or to the Judge thereof, either in or out of
the court, for judgment thereon, and judgment may be given
accordingly.

CHAPTER II.

ISSUES, AND THE MODE OF TRIAL.

§ 219. Issues arise upon the pleadings when a fact or conclusion
of law is maintained by the one party and controverted by
the other. They are of two kinds;

1. Of law; and
2. Of fact.

§ 220. An issue of law arises,
1. Upon a demurrer to the complaint, answer or reply, or
to some part thereof.

§ 221. An issue of fact arises,

1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint controverted by the answer; or,

2. Upon new matter in; the answer controverted by the
reply; or, i

3. Upon new matter in the reply, except an issue of law
is joined thereon. '

§ 222. Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon difi‘erent
parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases
the issues .of law must be first tried, unless the court otherwise direct:

§ 223. A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between
the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact.

§ 224. An issue of law must be tried by the Judge of the court,
unless it be referred, as provided in sections two hundred and
forty-four and two hundred and forty-live. An issue of

specific real or personal property, or for a divorce from the
marriage contract on the ground of adultery, must be tried
by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived, as provided in sec-’
tion two hundred and forty, or a reference be ordered, as

provided in sections two hundred and forty-four and two
hundred and forty-tive.

§ 225. Every other issue is triable by the court, or the Judge
thereof, who, however, may order the'whole issue, or any
specific question of 'fact involved therein, to be tried by a.
jury, or may refer it, as provided in sections two hundred
and forty-four and two hundred and fortyfive.

§ 226. Every issue of fact joined on the pleadings, and inquiry
I of damages required to be tried by a jury, shall be tried at
the term of the court next ensuing such joinderof iSSue or
order for inquiry; provided such issue shall have been
joined or order for inquiry made, more than thirty days
before such term, but if not, they shall be tried at the second
term after such joinder or order.

§ 227. Any party to any action may apply to the court in which
it is pending, or to the Judge thereof, after three days
notice in writing to the adverse party, to have the trial
deferred to a term subsequent to that in which it is regularly
triable; 'such‘ application must be made thirty days before:
the trial term, and must be on aflidavit. The court or
Judge may defer the trial as asked for, on such terms as
shall be just, if satisfied:

1. That the applicant has used due diligence to have his
case ready for trial; and,

2. That by reason of circumstances beyond his control,
which he shall set forth, he cannot have a fair trial at the
regular trial term; if the application is made by reason of

the expected absence of a witness, it shall state the name
and residence of the witness, the facts expected to be proved
by him, and the grounds for the expectation of his nonattendance, and that the applicant expects to procure his
evidence at or before some namedsubsequent term.

The applicant shall in all cases pay the costs of the applis
cation. 

§ 228. The Judge at any time during the term at which an
action is triable, may postpone the trial on the application
of either party and on such terms as shall be just, if satisfied: ' 1. That the applicant has used due diligence to be ready
for trial. '

2. That he cannot have a fair trial at that term, by reason
of circumstances stated, and if the ground of application
be, the non-attendance of a witness, the affidavit shall
contain the particulars required by subdivision two of section two hundred and twenty-seven. Unless the applicant
shall also set forth in his afiidavit, that the facts upon which
his application is grounded occurred, or came to his knowledge
too late to allow him to apply as prescribed in the last section, and that his application is made as soon as it
reasonably could be after the knowledge of such facts, the
postponement shall not be granted, except on the terms of
the payment of the costs in the action for the term.

§ 229. The criminal calender shall be first disposed of, unless by
consent of counsel, or for reasons satisfactory to the Judge,
particular criminal actions may be deferred. The issues
on the civil calendar shall be disposed of in the following
order, unless, for the convenience of parties or the dispatch
of business, the court shall otherwise direct:

1. Issues of fact to be tried by a jury;
2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court;
3. Issues of law.

CHAPTER III.

TRIAL BY JURY.

§ 230. A separate trial between a plaintiff and any of the several
defendants may be allowed by the court, whenever, in its
opinion, justice will thereby be promoted.

§ 231. The clerk shall furnish the Judge with a coPy of the

' summons and pleadings, and with the offer of the defendant
if any shall have been made.

§ 232. A general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce
generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of
the plaintiff or defendant. .A special verdict is that by

which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to
the court. l ‘

§ 233. In an action for the recovery of specific personal property,
if the property have not been delivered to the plaintiff, or
the defendant by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury
shall assess the value of the property, it their verdict be in
favor of the plaintiff; or if they {ind in favor of the defendant, and that he is entitled to a return thereof; and may
at the same time assess the damages, if any are claimed in the
complaint or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason of the detention or taking and withholding such property.

In every action for the recovery of money only, or speciiic
real property, the jury, in their discretion, may render a
general or special verdict. In all other cases, the court may
direct the jury to find a special verdict in writing, upon all
or any of the issues; and in all cases may instruct them if
they render a general verdict, to hnd upon particular questions of facts, to be stated in writing, and may direct a
written finding thereon. The special verdict or finding
shall be filed with the clerk, and entered upon the minutes.


§ 234. , Where a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent with
the general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and
the court shall give judgment accordingly.

§ 235. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an action for
the recovery of money, or for the defendant when a set-oft
for the recovery of money is established beyond the amount
of the plaintiff’s claim as established, the jury must also
assess the amount of the recoVery; they may also, under
the direction of the court, assess the amount of the recovery
when the court give judgment for the plaintiff on the
answer. If a set-off, established at the trial, exceed the V

plaintiff‘s demand so established, judgment for the defendant must be given for the excess; or if it appear that the

defendant is entitled to any other ailirmative relief, judgment must be given accordingly.

§ 236. Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make an entry in his minutes, specifying the time and place of the
trial, the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and
either the judgment rendered thereon, or‘ an order that the
cause be reserved for argument or further consideration. If
a different direction be not given by the court, the clerk
must enter judgment in conformity with the verdict. 

If an exception be taken, it may be reduced to writing at
the time, or entered in the Judge’s minutes, and afterwards
settled as provided by the rules of the court, and then stated
in writing in a case, or separately, with so much of the evidence as may be material to the questions to be raised, but
a bill of exceptions need not be made. (3.) If the exceptions be in the first instance stated in a case, and it be
necessary to separate them, the separation may be made
under the direction of the Judge. (4.) The Judge who
tries the cause may, in his discretion, entertain a motion, to
be made on his minutes, to set aside a verdict and grant a
new trial upon exceptions, or for insquicient evidence, or for
. excessive damages; but such motion can only be heard at
the same term at which the trial is had. When such motion
' is heard and decided upon the minutes of the Judge, and an
appeal is taken from the decision, a case or exceptions must
be settled in the usual form, upon which the argument of
the appeal must be had.

§ 287. No Judge, in giving a charge to the petty jury, shall give
an opinion whether a fact is fully or sufliciently proven,
such matter being the true oHice and province of the jury;
but he shall state in a plain and correct manner, the evidence given [in the case, and declare and explain the law
arising thereon. '

§ 288. Every Judge, at the request of any party to an action on
trial, made at or before the close of the evidence, before
instructing the jury on the law, shall put his instructions in
writing, and read them to the jury; he shall then sign and
file them with the Clerk as a part of the record of the action.

§ 239. Counsel praying of the Judge instructions to the jury,
shall put their request in writing entitled of the cause, and
sign them; otherwise the Judge may disregard them; they
shall be filed with the clerk as a part of the record.

CHAPTER IV.

TRIAL BY THE COURT;

§ 240. Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties to an
issue of fact, in actions on contract, and with the assent of
the court, in other actions, in the manner following:

‘1. By failing to appear at the trial.

2. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with

the clerk. A
3. By oral consent, entered in the minutes.

§ 241. Upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, its decision shall be given in writing, and shall contain a statement
of the facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately;
and upon a trial of an issue at law, the decision shall be
made in the same manner, stating the conclusions of law.
Such decision shall be filedwith the clerk during the court
at which the trial takes place. Judgment upon the decision
shall be entered accordingly.

§ 242. For the purposes of an appeal, either party may
except to a decision on a matter of law arising upon ‘such
trial within ten days after the judgment, in the same manner
and with the same effect as upon a trial by jury. Provided,
' however, that where the decision does not authorize a final
judgment, but directs further proceedings before a referee
or otherwise, either party may except thereto, and make a .
case or exception as above provided in case of an appeal.

[2.] And either party desiring a review, upon the evidence appearing on the trial, of the questions of law may,
at any time within ten days after the judgment, or within
such time as may be prescribed by the rules of the court,

~ jury, except that the Judge, in settling the case, must briefly
specify the facts found by him, and his conclusions of law.

§ 243. On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an issue of law, the
plaintiff may proceed in the manner prescribed by the hrst
two subdivisions of section two hundred and seventeen, upon
' the failure of the defendant to answer, where the summons
was personally served. If judgment be for the defendant,
upon an issue of law, and if taking of an account or the
proof of any fact be necessary to. enable the court to complete the judgment, a reference or assessment by jury may
be ordered, as in that section provided.

CHAPTER V.
TRIAL BY REFEREES.

§ 241. All, or any, of the issues in the action, whether of fact or
of law, or both, may be referred, upon the written consent
of the parties. ‘

§ 245. Where the parties do not consent, the court may, upon
the application of either, of its own motion, except where
the investigation will require the decision of dichult questions of law, direct a reference in the following cases:

1. Where the trial of an issue of fact shall require the
examination of a long account on either side; in which
case the referee may be directed to hear and decide the
whole issue, or to report upon any specific question of fact
involved therein; or,

2. Where the taking of an account shall be necessary for
the information of the court, before judgment, or for carrying a judgment order into effect; or, O

3. When case involves a complicated question ofboundary,
or one which requires a personal view of the premises.

4. Where a question of fact, other'than upon the pleadings,
shall arise, upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the

action.

§ 246. The trial by referees shall be conducted in the same
manner, as a trial by the court. They shall have the same
power to grant adjournments and to allow amendments to
any pleadingsiand to the summons, as the court upon such
trial, upon the same terms and with like effect. They shall
have the same power to preserve order and punish all violations thereof upon such trial, and to compel the attendance
of witnesses before them by attachment, and to punish them
as for a contempt for non-attendance or refusal to be sworn
or testify, as is possessed by the court. They must state the
facts found and the conclusions of law separately; and their
7 decision must be given, and may be excepted to and
reviewed in like manner, and with like effect in all respects
as in cases of appeal under section two hundred and fortytwo; and they may in like manner settle a case or exceptions. The report of the referees upon the whole issue
shall stand as the decision of the court, and judgment may
be entered thereon upon application to the ndge, and his
order. A When the reference is to report the facts, the report
shall have the effect of a special verdict.

§ 247. In all cases of reference the parties as to whom issues are
formed in the action (except when the defendant is an infant
or an absentee) may agree in writing upon a person or
persons, not exceedingihree, and a reference shall be ordered
to him or them, and to no other person, or persons. And

if such parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or
more referees, not more than three, who shall be free from
exception. And no person shall be appointed referee to
whom all parties in the action shall object, except in actions
for divorce. And no Judge or J usti'ce of any court shall sit
as referee in any action pending in the court of which he is
Judge or Justice, and not already referred, unless the
parties otherwise stipulate. The referee or referees shall
make and deliver a report within sixty days from the time
the action shall be finally submitted; and in default thereof,
and before the report is delivered, either party may serve
notice upon the Opposite party that he elects to end the
reference; and thereupon the action shall proceed as though
no reference had been Ordered, and the. referees shall not in

such case be entitled to any fees.

The report of the referee shall be made to the clerk of the
court in which the action is pending: either party after ten
days notice to the adverse party, may move the Judge to
review such report, and set aside, modify, or confirm the
same in whole or in part, and no judgment shall be entered
on any reference except by order of the Judge.

any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint.
and embraced within the issue. '

§ 250. Whenever damages are reco'verable, the plaintiff may

defendant claim a return thereof, judgment for the defendant may be for a return of the property, or the value thereof
in case a return cannot be had, and damages for taking and
withholding the same.

§ 252. The Clerk of the Superior Court shall enter every judgment of the court, on his judgment book; it shall specify

judgment shall be, or shall have been, restrained from proceeding thereon by an order of injunction,‘or other order,
or by the operation of any appeal, shall not constitute any
part of the ten years aforesaid, as against the defendant in
such judgment, or the party obtaining sticli orders or making
such appeal, or any other person who is not a purchaser,
creditor or mortgagee in good faith. But whenever an
appeal from any judgment shall be pending, and the undertaking requisite to stay execution on such judgment shall
have been given, and the appeal perfected as provided in
the Code, the court in which such judgment was recovered
may, on special motion, after notice to the person owning
the judgment, on such terms as they shall see fit, direct an
entry to be made by the clerk on the docket of such judgment, that the same is “ secured on appeal, ” and thereupon
it shall cease, during the pendency of said appeal, to be a.

property which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the
satisfaction of the judgment, such court or Judge may, by
an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place, to answer concerning the same; and
such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application
of the property of the judgment debtor towards the satisfaction of the judgment as are provided upon the return of
an execution. ( 3.) On an examination under this section,

either party may examine witnesses in his behalf, and the
judgment debtor may be examined in the same manner as
a witness. (4.) Instead of the. order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the Judge may, upon proof” by aiiidavit or otherwise, to his satisfaction, that there is
danger of the debtor’s leaving the State, or concealing him-self, and that there is reason to believe he has property
which he unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, issue
.a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where such
debtor may be, to arrest him' and bring him before such
Judge. Upon being brought before the Judge, he may be
examined on oath, and, if it then appears that there is
danger of the debtor leaving the State, and that he has
property which he has unjustly refused to apply to such
judgment, ordered to enter into an undertaking, with one
or more sureties, that he will, from time to time, attend
before the Judge as he shall direct, and that he will not,
during the pendency of the proceedings, dispose of any
i , property not exempt from execution. In default of enter» ing into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison
i i by warrant of the J udgehas for a contempt.  No person
, , shall, on examination pursuant to this chapter, be excused
, , from answering any question on the ground that his examination will tend to convict him of the commission of a
1 fraud; but his answer shall not be used asevidence against
him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution. Nor shall
he be excused from answering any question, on the ground
that he has, before the examination, executed any conveyance, assignment or transfer of his property for any purpose, but his answer shall not be used as evidence against
him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution.

§ 265. After the issuing of execution against property, any
person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the
sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as shall
be necessary to satisfy the execution; and the sheriff’s
receipt, shall be a sufficient discharge, for the amount so
paid.

§ 266. After the issuing or return of an execution against pro;perty of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors
in the same judgment, and upon aiiidavit that any person
or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or is
indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, the
,Judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation,
or any oilicer or member thereof, to appear at a specified
time andiplace, and answer concerning the same. The
Judge may also, in his discretion, require notice of such

proceeding to be given to any party to the action, in such
manner as may seem to him proper.

The proceedings mentioned in this section and in section
two hundred and sixty-four may be taken upon the return
of an execution unsatisfied, issued upon a judgment recovered in an action against joint debtors, in which some of the
defendants have not been served with the summons by
which said action was commenced, so far as relates to the
joint property of such debtors; and all actions by creditors
to obtain satisfaction of judgments out of the property of
joint debtors are maintainable in the like manner and to the
like effect. These provisions shall apply to all proceedings
and actions now pending. and not actually terminated by
any final judgment or decree, and not embraced in the
‘Ordinance of ‘ the Convention of this State, entitled “ An
Ordinance respecting the Jurisdiction of the Courts of this
.State, ” ratilied fourteenth day of March 1868.

§ 267. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify on any
proceedings under this chapter, in the same manner as upon
.the trial of an issue.

§ 268. The party or witness may be required to attend before the
Judge, or before a referee appointed by the court or Judge;
a’f before a referee, the examination shall be taken by the

referee, and certified to the Judge.‘ All examinations and
answers before a J udgcor referee, under this chapter, shall
be on oath, except that when ’a corporation answers, the
answer shall be on the oath of an afi'icer thereof. '

§ 269. The Judge may order any property of the judgment
debtor, net exempt from execution, in the hands either of ‘
himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor,
to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment;
except that the earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within sixty days next preceeding the
order, cannot be so applied when it is made to appear, by the
debtor’s afiidavit or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.

§ 270. The Judge may also, by order, appoint a receiver of the
property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner, and
with the like authority, as if the appointment was made by
the court, according to section two hundred and fifteen. But
before the appointment of such receiver, the Judge shall
ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of the party or otherwise, whether any other supplementary proceedings are
pending against the judgment debtor, and if such proceedings are so pending, the plaintiff therein shall have notice
to appear before him, and shall likewise have notice of all
subsequent proceedings in relation to said receivership. No
more than one receiver of the property of a judgement
debtor shall be appointed. The Judge may also, by order,
forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property of the
judgment debtor not exempt from execution, and any inter»
ference therewith.

Q

Whenever the Judge shall grant an order for the appointment 'of a receiver of the property of the judgment debter,
the same shall be tiled in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county where the judgment-roll in the
action or transcript from justice’s judgment, upon which the
proceedings are taken, is filed; and the clerk shall record
the order in a book to be kept for that purpose in his oiiice,
to be called “ Book of orders appointing receivers ,ot judgment debtors, ” and shall note the time of the filing of said
order therein. A certified copy of said order shall be delivered to the receiver named therein, and he shall be vested
with the property and effects of the judgment debtor from
the time of the tiling and recording of the order as aforesaid.
The receiver of the judgment debtor shall be subject to the
direction and control of the court in which the judgment
was obtained upon which the preceedings are founded.

But before he shall be vested with any real property of
such judgment debtor, a certiiied copy of said order shall
also be filed and recorded on the execution docket, in the
office of the clerk of the Superior Court of the county in
which any real estate of such judgment debtor sought to be
effected by such order is situated, and also in the ofEce of
the clerk of the Superior Court of the county in which such
judgment debtor resides.

§ 271. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims
an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the
debt, such interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an
action against such person or corporation by the receiver;
but the Judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest, till a sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action, and
prosecute the same to judgment and execution; but such
order may be modified or dissolved by the Judge granting
the same, at any time, on‘ such security as he shall direct.

§ 272. The Judge may, in his discretion, order a reference to a'
referee agreed upon by the parties, or appointed by him, to
report the evidence or the facts, and may, in his discretion,
appoint such referee in the first order, or at any time. ‘

§ 273. The Judge may allow to the judgment creditor, or to any
party so examined, whether a party to the action or not,

witnesses’ fees and disbursements, and a fixed sum in addition, not exceeding thirty dollars, as costs.

§ 274. If any person, party, or witness, disobey an order of the
Judge or referee, duly served, such person, party, or witness,
may be punished by the Judge as for a contempt. And
in all cases of commitment under this chapter, the person
committed may, in case of inability to perform the act
required, or to endure the imprisonment, be discharged 7
from imprisonment by the court or Judge committing him,
or the court in which the judgment was rendered, on such
terms as may be just.

‘ The sections of this chapter, from section two hundred
and sixty-four, to section two hundred and seventy-fucr both
inclusive, shall be applicable to all judgments which shall
be recovered after the ratilication of this Act, except judg-'
ments upon causes of action embraced in the provisions of

this State,” ratified on the fourteenth of March, 1868, which

shall be governed by the existing laws.
