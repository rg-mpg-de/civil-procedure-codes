sum as the Raid court or judge shall deem proper, conditioned that 
the said complainant will prosecute his bill or petition with effect;

costs as he shall wrongfully sustain by occasion of the said writ.

an equitable character, and the time of performance of the duty
or obligation of the defendant has expired ; if not, then the pro-

upon such motion it shall be lawful for the parties to introduce
testimony to support the bill and answer; the court shall decide
such motion upon the weight of testimony, without being bound
to take the answer as absolutely true. If, after such dissolution
is moved for, the plaintiff in the bill will satisfy the court by his
own affidavit, or the affidavit of any disinterested person, that
the answer, or any material part thereof (to be specified in such
affidavit), is untrue, and that he has witnesses whose testimony he
believes he can procure by the next term of the court, who will 
disprove the said answer, or such material part thereof as shall be
specified as aforesaid, and that he has had no opportunity to pro­
cure such testimony since the coming in of the answer, it shall be
lawful for the court to grant a continuance of the said motion, until
the next term. The testimony to be heard on such motions, aside
from the bill and answer, shall be by depositions in writing, taken
as in other cases in chancery proceedings, except the affidavits
which may have been filed with the bill or answer, which may be
read on such motion as heretofore ; and the depositions taken to
disolve an injunction, mny be read on the final hearing of the cause
in which they have been taken.

formal pleading. 
Sze. 24. Where the court adjudges that the widow shall
recover dower, it shall be so entered of record, together with a
description of the land out of which she is to be endowed; and
said court shall thereupon appoint three commissioners, not con- 
nected with any of the parties either by consanguinity or affinity,
and entirely disinterested; each of whom shall take the following
oath, to be administered by the court or some justice of the peace : 
"I do solemnly swear, that I will fairly and impartially allot and set otr to

(1.) BY THE ACT OF THE INJURED PARTY. 
1. ARBITRATIONS AND AWARDS. 
SEc. 3. The arbitrators appointed in pursuance of the foregoing
provisions, or. a majority of them, shall proceed with diligence to 
hear and determine the matters in controversy. They shall
&J>point a place and time for hearing, and adjourn the same from
tune to time as may be necessary. And on the application of
either J>&rtY, and for good cause, they may postpone such hearing 
ft-om time to time, not extending beyond the next term of the
court in which the said suit is pending, if the subject matter 
be in suit.
SEC. 4. Before proceeding to hear any testimony in the cause, 
the arbitrators shall be sworn, faithfully and fairly to bear and
examine and determine the cause, according to the principles of
equity and justice; and to make a just and true award according
to the best of their understanding, which oath may be administered
by any justice of the peace, or clerk of the circuit court, in which 
the suit is pending.
SEc. 5. The several clerks of the circuit courts, and the justices 
of the peace in their several counties, may issue subpcenas for the
attendance of witnesses before arbitrators : If any witness, after 
being duly summoned, shall fail to attend, the arbitrators may
issue an attachment to compel his attendance, and the said witness
shall, moreover, be liable to the party for refusing to attend the
same as in trials at law. Any one of the arbitrators may adminis­
ter oaths and affirmations to witnesses; they mny punish contempts
committed in their presence during the hearing of a cause, the
same as a court of record, and may admit depositions to be read

submission. 
SEc. 8. The party filing such award may, at the next term
after such filing, by giving four days' notice of his intention, to 
the opposite party, and if no legal exceptions are taken to such
award or other proceedings, have final judgment thereon, as on
the verdict of a jury, for the sum specified in said award to be
due, together with the costs of arbitration and of the court ; and
execution may be issued therefor as in other cases. 
SEc. 9. When the award requires the performance of any act
other than the payment of money, the court rendering such judg­ 
ment shall enforce the same by rule, and the party refusing or
neglecting to comply with such rule, may be proceeded against
by attachment or otherwise, as for a. contempt. 
SEc. 10. If any legal defects appear in the award, or other
proceedings, or if it shall be made to appear on oath.or affirmation 
that said award was obtained by fraud, corruption or other undue
means, or that such arbitrators misbehaved, said court may set
aside such award. 
Sao, 11. If there be any evident miscalculation or misdescrip- ,
tion, or if the arbitrators shall appear to have awarded upon
matters not submitted to them, not affecting the merits of the 
decision upon the matters submitted, or where the award shall be
imperfect in some matter of form, not affecting the merits of the
controversy ; and where such errors and defects, if in a verdict,
could have been lawfully amended or disregarded by the court,
any party aggrieved may move the court to modify or correct 
such award. 
SEC. 12. Application to set aside, modify or amend such award,
as provided - in the two preceding sections, must be made before 
the entry of final judgment on such award: Provided, Nothing
herein contained shall be so construed as to deprive courts ofEqu1t1
chancery of their jurisdiction, as in other cases. 
SEC. 13. Writs of error and appeals may be taken from any
decision of the court by the party deeming himself aggrieved, as 
in other cases ; and if the supreme court shall remand the case,
such further proceedings shall be had as the nature of the case
may require. .

made, but to be recovered of the other party with the other costs 
of suit, if the award or final decision shall entitle the prevailing
party to recover costs. Witnesses shall receive the same fees for 
attendance at arbitrations as shall be allowed them in the circuit
courts. Sheriffs, constables, clerks and justices of the peace, shall
be entitled to the same fees for services performed in relation to
any arbitration, as shall be allowed by law for the like services in
their respective courts. 
SEc. 15. Arbitrators may be compelled by order of the court in
which any cause submitted to them shall be pending, to proceed 
to a hearing thereof, and to make report without unnecessary
delay. · 
SEC. ·16. When any cause pending in any court, shall be
referred, as herein provided, an entry of such reference shall be

her nght accrued, to recover her dower of any lands, tenements or
hereditaments, 
Ssc. 3. No person shall recover in ejectment, unless he has, at
the time of commencing the action, a valid subsisting interest in 
the premises claimed, and a right to recover the same, or to recover
the possession thereof, or of some share, interest or portion thereof,
to be proved and established at the trial. 
SEc. 4. If the premises for which the action is brought, are
actually occupied by any person, such actual occupant shall be 
named defendant in the declaration ; if they are not so occupied,
the action shall be brought against some person exercising acts of
ownership on the prenuses claimed, or claiming title thereto, or
some interest therem, at the commencement of the suit. 
SEC, 5. 1'he action shall be commenced by the service of a
declaration, in which the names of the real claimants shall be
inserted as plaintiffs ; and all the provisions of law concerning
lessors of a plaintiff, shall apply to such plaintiffs. 
SEc. 6. The use of fictitious names of plaintiffs or defendants,
and of the names of any other than the real claimants and the real
defendants, and the statements of any lease or demise to the
plaintiff, and of an ejectment by a casual or nominal ejector, are
hereby abolished. 
SEc. 7. It shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to aver in his
declaration that ( on some day therein to be specified, and which
shall be after his title accrued) he was possessed of the premises
in question ( describing them as hereinafter provided), and being
so-possessed thereof, that the defendant afterward (on some day
to be stated) entered into such premises, and that he unlawfully
withholds from the plaintiff the possession thereof, to his damage
any nominal sum the plaintiff shall think proper to state; and the
premises so claimed shall be described in such declaration with
convenient certainty, so that, from such description, possession of.
the premises claimed, may be delivered. If such plaintiff claims
any undivided share or interest in any premises, he shall state the
same particularly in such declaration. 
SEc. 8. If the action be brought for the recovery of dower,
declaration shall state that the plaintiff was possessed of the one 
undivided third part of the premises, as her reasonable dower, as

presumptive evidence of such authority. · 
Sxc. 16. If it shall appear that, previous to such application by
any defendant, he was served with a. copy of the affidavit of the
plaintiff's attorney, showing his authority to bring such action,
such application shall be dismissed; and such defendant shall be 
liable for the costs of such application, the payment of which may
be compelled by attachment, as in other cases, which may be issued
upon proof of disobedience to the order of the court or officer
directing the payment of such costs. 
SEc. 1 7. The defendant may demur to the declaration ns in
personal actions, or he shall plead the general issue only, which
shall be that the defendant is not guilty of unlawfully withholding
the premises claimed by the plaintiff, as alleged in the declaration ;
and the filing of such plea or demurrer shall be deemed an appear-
ance in the cause ; and upon such plea, the defendant may give
the same matter in evidence, and the same proceedings shall be
bad, as upon the plea of not guilty in the present action of eject-
mcnt, except as herein otherwise provided. The defendant may
likewise give in evidence any matter which, if pleaded in the
present writ of right, or action of dower, would bar the action of
the plaintiff. 
SEc. 18. The consent rule heretofore used is hereby abolished.
SEc. 19. It shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to prove an 
actual entry under title, nor the actual receipt of any of the profits
of the premises demanded ; but it shall be sufficient for him to
show a right to the possession of such premises at the time of the
commencement of the suit, as heir, devisee, purchaser or otherwise. 
SEc. 20. It shall not be necessary on the trial for the defendant
to confess, nor for the plaintiff to prove lease, entry and ouster, or 
either of them, except as provided in the next section ; but this
section shall not be construed to impair, nor in any way to affect
any of the rules of evidence now in force in regard to the
maintenance and defense of the action. 
SEc. 21. If the action be brought by one or more tenants in
common, or joint tenants against their cotenants, the plaintiff, in
addition to all other evidence which he may be bound to give,

defendant actually ousted such plaintiff, or did some other act
amounting to a total denial of bis right as such cotenant. 
Ssc. 22. If the action be brought against several defendants,
and a joint possession of all be proved, the plaintiff shall be 
entitled to a verdict against all, whether they shall have pleaded
separately or jointly. 
SEc. 23. When the action is against several defendants, if it
appear on the trial, that any of them occupy distinct parcels, in
severalty or jointly, the plaintiff shall elect, at the trial, against
which he will proceed; which election shall be made before the
testimony in the cause shall be deemed to be closed ; and a verdict
shall thereupon be rendered for the defendants not so proceeded
against. 
SEc. 24-. In the following cases the verdict shall be rendered as
follows: 
1st. If it be shown on the trial, that all the plaintiffs have a
right to recover the possession of the premises, the verdict in that
respect shall be· for the plaintiffs generally. 
2d. If it appear that one or more of the plaintiffs have a right 
to the possession of the premises, and that one or more have not
such right, the verdict shall specify for which plaintiff the jury
find, and as to which plaintiff they find for the defendant.

defendants, the verdict shall be rendered against such of them as
were in possession of the premises, or as claimed title thereto at
the commencement of the action. 
4th. If the verdict be for all the premises claimed, as specified
in the declaration, it shall, in that respect, be for such premises
generally. 
5th. If the verdict be for a part of the premises described in
such declaration, the verdict shall particularly specify such part,
as the same shall have been proved, with the same certainty
hereinbefore required in the description of the premises claimed.

premises claimed, it shall specify such share or interest; and
for an undivided share in a part of the premises claimed, it shall

shall be rendered, whether such estate be in fee, for his own life,
or for the life of another, stating such lives; or whether it be for
a term of years, and specifying the duration of such term. 
SEC. 25. If the right or title of a plaintiff in ejectment expire
after the commencement of the suit, but before trial, the verdict 
shall be returned according to the fact, and judgment shall be
entered that he recover his damages by reason of the withholding
of the premises by the defendant, to be assessed ; and that as to 
the premises claimed, the defendant go thereoff without day. 
SEc. 26. The action of ejeetment shall not be abated by the
death of any plaintiff, or of one of several defendants, after issue
and before verdict and judgment, but the same proceedings may
be had as in other actions, to substitute the names of those who
may succeed to the title of the plaintiff so dying; in which case
the issue shall be tried as between the original parties ; and in 
case of the death of a. defendant, the cause shall proceed against 
the other defendants. 
SEc. 27. In cases where no other provision is made, the judg-Judgment.
ment in the action, if the plaintiff' prevail, shall be, that the plaintiff 
recover the possession of the premises according to the verdict of
the jury, if there was such verdict; or, if the judgment be by
default, according to the description thereof in the declaration,
with costs to be taxed.

a writ of possession, which shall be substantially in the following
form:

or a separate execution may be issued therefor.) 
"Witne88, etc." 
SEc. 29. Every judgment in the action of ejectment, rendered
upon a verdict, shall be conclusive as to the title established in 
such action, upon the party against whom the same is rendered,
and against all persons claiming from, through or under such party,

the judgment and grant another new trial; but no more than two
new trials shall be granted under this section. 
SEC. 31. Every judgment in ejectment rendered by default,

the action ; but within two years after the entering of such judg­
ment, on the application of the defendant, his heirs or assigns, and
upon the payment of all costs and damages recovered thereby, the
court may vacate such judgment and grant a new trial, if such

SEC. 36. The plaintiff recovering judgment in ejectment in any Suggestion tor 
of the cases in which such action may be maintained, shall also be f1Wffl4I protlt.a. 
entitled to recover damages against the defendant for the rents
and profits of the premises recovered. 
SEc. 87. Instead of the action of trespass for 'l7U!8'Tl,6 profits
heretofore used, the plaintiff seeking to recover such damages
shall, within one year after the entering of the judgment, make
and file a suggestion of such claim, which shall be entered, with
the proceedings thereon, upon the record of such judgment, or be
attached thereto as a continuation of the same. 
SEc. 88. Such suggestion shall be substantially in the same form
as is now in use for a declaration in an action of assumpsit for the
use and occupation, as near as may be ; and it shall be served
on the defendant in the same manner hereinbefore prescribed
respecting the service of a declaration in ejectment; and the same
rules of pleading thereto shall be observed as upon declarations in
personal actions. 
SEc. 89. The defendant may plead the general issue of non­
assumpsit, and, under such plea, may give notice of or may plead
specially any matter in bar of such claim, except such as were or

other person, of the same premises, or of part thereof, subsequent
to the verdict in such action of ejectment, in bar or in mitigation
of the damages claimed by the plaintiff 
SEc. 40. If any issue of fact be joined on such suggestion, it
shall be tried as in other cases ; and if such issue be found for the
plaintiff, the same jury shall assess bis damages to the amount of'
the meene profits received by the defendant since he entered into
possession of "the premises, subject to the restrictions hereinafter
contained. 
SEc. 41. On the trial of such issue, the plaintiff shall be required

during which he enjoyed the mesne profits thereof, and the value
of such profits; and the record of the recovery in the action
of ejectment shall not be evidence of such time. On such trial
the defendant shall have the same right to set off an1, improve­
ments made on the premises, to the amount of the plaintiff''a claim,
as is now or shall hereafter be allowed by law ; and in estimating
the plaintiff's damages, the value of the nee by the defendant of
any improvements made by him shall not be allowed to the plaintiff. 
SEc. 42. If no issue of fact be joined on such suggestion, or if
judgment thereon be rendered against the defendant by default,

other cases. 
SEc. 48. Upon the execution of such writ, the plaintiff shall be
required to establish the same matters hereinbefore required in the
case of an issue being joined, and the defendant may in like

the case of the issue being joined, the court shall render judgment
as in actions of assumpsit, for use and occupation, which shall have
the like effect in all respects.

tions and control, as commissioners appointed pursuant to law to

of action, writ or prosecution, for, or on account of any rents, or
profits or damages, which shall have been done, accrued or
incurred at any time prior to receipt of actual notice of the adverse
claim, by which the eviction may be effected, provided such person
obtained peaceable possession of the land. 
SEc. 48. The court who shall pronounce and give judgment of
eviction, either in law or equity, shall, at the time, nominate seven
fit persons, any five of whom Rhall have power, and it shall be their
duty to go on the premises, and, after viewing the same, on oath
or affirmation, to assess the value of all suoh lasting and valuable
improvements which shall have been made thereon prior to the
receipt of such notice as aforesaid; and, also, to assess all damages 
the land may have sustained by the commission of any kind of 
waste, or by deduction of soil by cultivation, or otherwise, during
the occupancy of the person evicted, and subtract the same from
the estimated value of the said improvements, which assessment,
signed and sealed by the persons making the same, shall be by
them lodged with the clerk of the court wherein they were norm­ 
nated, before the next ensuing term, or as soon thereafter as may
be convenient; and at the next court, after such assessment, it
shall be entered up as a judgment in favor of the person evicted,
and against the successful claimant of the land, by the clerk ; upon
which judgment execution shall immediately be issued by the
clerk, if directed by the person evicted, unless the successful
claimant shall give bond and security, to be jud~ed of by the
court, to the person evicted, and to be taken at the time of entering
up such judgment, conditioned to pay the same within twelve
months from the date thereof, with five per cent. interest thereon :
Provided, The balance shall ultimately be in favor of such occupy­
ing claimant, according to the directions and provisions of this
chapter, which bond shall have the force of a judgment, and at the
expiration of twelve months aforesaid, an execution shall be issued
upon the same by the clerk of the court in which it was taken, at
the request of the party entitled thereto, on oath being made that
the same is yet due. Should the balance be in favor of the
successful claimant, judgment, in like manner, shall be entered up
in his favor, against the other party, for the amount of the same,
upon which execution may be issued as aforesaid, unless bond and
security be given to such claimant, which may be acted upon in
the manner before directed, and to declare what shall be the law
between adverse claimants under distinct titles of the kinds
aforesaid after notice. 
SEc. 49. The persons nominated by the court, as aforesaid,
when making an assessment, shall carefully distinguish between
such improvements as were made on the land prior to notice and
those which were made after notice; and when making an assess­
ment, they shall also take into consideration all such necessary and
lasting improvements as shall have been made on the lands after
the receipt of such notice as aforesaid, and shall ascertain the
amount of the value thereof; and they shall also take into consid­
eration and ascertain the amount of the rent and profits arising from
the whole of the improvements on the land from the time that notice
of such adverse claim was received by such occupying claimant,
and then, after taking the amount of one from the other, the
balance shall be added or subtracted from the amount of the value
of the improvements which shall have been made before the receipt
of the notice aforesaid, as the nature of the case shall require. 
SEc. 50. The commissioners shall also estimate the value of the
lands in dispute exclusive of any improvements that shall have
been made thereon, and make report of the amount of such valua­
tion to the court; and if the value of the improvements shall
exceed such estimated value of the land in dispute, in that case it
shall and may be lawful for the proprietor of the better title to
transfer or convey, as the nature of the case may require, his better
title to the occupying claimant, and thereupon judgment shall be
entered up in his favor, against the occupying claimant, for such
estimated value, upon which an execution may issue, unless the
occupying claimant shall give bond and security, to be approved
by the court, to pay the amount of such judgment within one year 
after the person transferring or conveying, as aforesaid, with 
interest from the date, which bond shall have the force of a judg­
ment, and if not paid at the expiration of the year, an execution
may issue, in the manner before directed by this chapter:
Provided, That the proprietor of the better title shall, in every
such case, at the time of entering up judgment in his favor, give
bond and security, to be approved by the court, to the occupying
claimant, to refund the amount of such judgment, in case the land
so transferred or conveyed shall ever thereafter be taken from him
by any other prior or better claim, 
SEc. 51. The persons nominated by the court, by virtue of this
chapter, shall be called commissioners, and shall respectively take
an oath or affirmation to do equal right to the parties in contro­
versy; and shall also have power and authority to call witnesses
and administer the necessary oaths, and to examine them for the
ascertainment of any fact material in the inquiry and assessment
by this chapter directed. 
SEc. 52. The said commissioners, in making every estimate of
value by virtue of this chapter, shall state separately the result of
each, and the court shall have power to make such allowance to
the said commissioners, in any case, as shall seem just, which
allowance shall be taxed and collected as costs : Provided; That
this chapter shall not be extended to affect or impair the obligation
of contracts, or to authorize the occupying claimant to be twice
paid for his improvements ; and in all cases where the occupying
claimant is paid for his improvements by any other person than the
proprietor of the better title, such person shall have the same
redress as is allowed to the occupying claimant. 
SEc. 53. The court shall have the same power to proceed by 
appointing commissioners to assess the value of improvements,
and the damages by the commission of any kind of waste, by
reduction of soil, by cultivation or otherwise, during the occupancy
of the person evicted in case of arbitration, or by consent of the
parties, on motion, without suit. 
SEc. 54. Notice of any adverse claim or titl~ to the land, within
the meaning of this chapter, shall have been given by bringing a
suit, either in law or equity, for the same, by the one or other of
the parties, and may hereafter be given by bringing a suit as afore­
said, or by delivenng an attested copy of the entry, survey or
patent from which he derives his title or claim, or leaving any such
copy with the party, his wife, or other free person above the age
of sixteen yea.rs, on the plantation: Provided, Iunoeoer, That notice
given by the delivery of an attested copy, as aforesaid, shall be void,
unless suit is brought within one year thereafter : Provided, That
in no case shall the proprietor of the better title be obliged to pay
to the occupyin~ claimant, for improvements made after notice,
more than what is equal to the rents and profits aforesaid. 
SEc. 55. Notice to any occupying claimant shall bind all those
claiming from, by or through such occupying claimant, to the extent
of such claim. 
( Precept to stay 11Jaste.)
Ssc. 56. Nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to 
prevent any court from issuing a precept to stay waste, and ruling
the party to give bond and security in such manner as such court 
may think right. . ' 
(Ejectmem ha8ed upon po88usion of the pwlic lands.)
SEc. 51. In all cases in which any person has heretofore entered 
upon and occupied, or shall hereafter enter upon and occupy, any
lands, tenements or hereditaments within . this state, by virtue of 
any lease or permit, from the United States or this state, such
person, his, her or their heirs or assigns, may have and maintain
an action of ejectment against any person who has or may enter
upon such lands, tenements or hereditaments without the consent
of such lessee, his, her or their heirs or assigns, and proof of the
right of possession shall be sufficient to authorize a recovery.

ages for the detention of such property while in the possession of
the defendant; and the damages in either case shall be assessed
by the jury, in case of a trial; but if the plaintiff shall not prose­
cute his snit, or if judgment shall in any manner be given for the
defendant, without a trial, the damages in such case may be

the affidavit shall be filed, and a trial shall be thereon had, if the 
issue shall be founct for the defendant, the attachment shall be
quashed. 
SEc. 9. The officer serving the writ, shall take and retain the
custody and possession of the property attached, to answer and 
abide by the judgment of the court, unless the person in whose
possession the same may be found, shall enter into bond and secu­
rity to the officer, to be approved by him, in double the value of the
property so attached, with condition that the said estate and prop­
erty shall be forthcoming to answer the judgment of the court in 
said suit. The sheriff shall return such bond to the court in which
the suit is brought, on the first day of the term to which such
attachment is returnable. 
SEc. 1 o. If such bond shall be forfeited, the sheriff may assign
such bond to the plaintiff in the attachment, by a writing thereon,
under his hand, in the presence of two or more credible witnesses,
and after such assignment the plainti1t may bring a suit in his own
name thereupon. If the plaintiff will not accept such assignment
of such bond, and the court shall adjudge such security insuffi­
cient, such sheriff shall be subject to the same Judgment and
recovery, and have the same liberty of defense, as if he had been
made defendant in the attachment, unless good and sufficient secu­
rity shall be given, and bond filed during the term of the court
to which such attachment is returnable, at which term the objec­
tions to the sufficiency of the security taken shall be made to
entitle the party suing out the attachment to proceed against the
sheriff; and execution may issue thereupon as in other cases of
judgment, And whenever the Judgment of the plaintiff, or any
part thereof, shall be paid or satisfied by any such sheriff, he shall
have the same remedy against the defendant for the amount so
paid by him, as is now provided by law for bail against their
principal, where a judgment is paid or satisfied by them . 
SEc. 11. If the sheriff shall fail to return a bond taken by virtue
of the provisions of this chapter, or shall have neglected to take 
one when he ought to have done so, in any attachment issued
under any provisions of this chapter, the plaintiff in the attach­
ment may cause a rule to be entered at auy time during the first
two days of the term, to which the writ is returnable, requiring
the said sheriff to return the said. bond; in case no bond has been
taken, to show cause why such bond was not taken. If the said
sheriff shall not return the said bond within one day thereafter, or
show legal and sufficient cause why the said bond had not" been
taken, judgment shall be entered up against him for the amount of
the plaintiff's demand, with costs of suit; execution may there­
upon issue for the same, whenever judgment shall have been entered
against the defendant in the attachment. 
..__ SEC. 12. ,vhen the sheriff shall be unable to find property of
any defendant sufficient to satisfy any attachment issued under 
the provisions of this chapter, he is hereby required to summon all
persons/within his county, whom the creditor shall designate, as
having any property, effects, or choses in action, in their posses­
sion or power belonging to the defendant, or who are in any wise
indebted to such defendant, to appear before the court to which
the writ is returnable, on the return day of the attachment, then
and there to answer upon oath, what amount they are indebted to 
/ > 
and discover on oath or affirmation, as by this chapter is directed,
it shall be lawful for the court, after solemnly calling the garnishee,
and such court is hereby authorized and required, to enter a condi­
tional judgment against such garnishee, and thereupon a scir~ 
f aciWJ shall issue against such garnishee, returnable to the next
term of the court, to show cause, if" any be have, why final judg­
ment should not be entered against him upon such scire faci<u
being duly executed and returned; if such garnishee shall fail to
appear accordingly, and discover on oath or affirmation in the
manner aforesaid, the court shall confirm such judgment and
award execution for the plaintiff's whole judgment and costs; and
if, upon the examination of any garnishee, it shall appear to the
court that there is any of the defendant's estate in the hands of
any person or persons who have not been summoned, such court
shall, upon motion of the plaintiff, grant a judicial attachment, to
he levied upon the property in the hands of such person or persons
having any of the estate of the defendant in his or their possession
or custody, who shall appear and answer, and be liable as other
garnishees. When any garnishee shall deliver to the sheriff all
the goods, chattels and effects whatsoever, found or confessed to
be in his or her possession belonging to the defendant, or any part
thereof, the same shall be received in discharge of so much of the
judgment as the same shall be appraised to by the jury aforesaid,
who shall inquire and return the value thereof, according to the
evidence which may be submitted to them relative thereto. 
SEC. 17. Whenever judgment shall be rendered against any
garnishee, and it shall appear that the debt from him to the 
defendant in the attachment is not yet due, execution shall not
issue against him until twenty days after the same shall become
due ; nor shall judgment be rendered against a garnishee, for a
debt founded on a negotiable instrument, unless the same shall be
due at the time of rendering the judgment. 
SEc. 18. If any such writ of attachment shall be served as afore-
said, it shall and may be lawful for any such plaintiff, at any time 
during the return term of the said court, to prepare, exhibit and
file, all and singular such allegations and interrogatories in writing,
upon which he or she shall be desirous to obtain, and compel the
answer of any and every garnishee, touching the lands, tenements,
goods, chattels, moneys, credits and effects of the said defendants,
and the value thereof, in his, her or their possession, custody or
charge, or from him, her or them, due and owing to the said
defendant at the time of the service of the said writ, or at any time
after, or which shall or may thereafter become due; and it shall be
the dutr of each and every such garnishee, to exhibit and file
under his oath or affirmation, on or before the third day of the next
succeeding term, full, direct and true answers to all and singular 
- 
the allegations and interrogatories by the said plaintiff supported,
exhibited and filed, in the manner hereinbefore directed and
described. 
SEC. 19. Wheneyer the plaintiff in any attachment shall allege,
that any garnishee summoned in such attachment, hath not dis­ 
covered the true amount of debts due from him to the defendant,
or what goods and chattels belonging to the defendant are in his
or her possession, the court shall direct, without the formality of
pleading, a jury to be empanneled immediately (unless good cause
he shown by either party for a continuance), to inquire what is the 
true amount due from such' garnishee to the defendant, and what
goods and chattels- are in his possession, belonging to the defend-
ant. Upon such examination, witnesses may be examined by the
respective parties, as in ordinary cases. If the findin~ of the jury
shall be against such garnishee, the court shall grant Judgment in
the same manner as if the facts found by the jury had been con
fessed by him or her, on his or her examination, and costs of
inquest; and if the jury find in favor of the garnishee, he shall
recover his costs against the plaintiit 
SEc. 20. Where any witness resides out of the state, or out of
the county in which any attachment may be pending, and in which
the testimony of such witness may be required, it shall be lawful
for either party or garnishee in such attachment, on filing interrog-
atories with the clerk of the court from which such attachment has
issued, and giving ten days' notice of the time and place of taking
such testimony, by serving e. copy of such notice on the opposite
party, or if such party shall be absent from, or reside out of the
county, then by affixing a notice in writing thereof on the door of
the court house of such county, at least ten days before the day
set for the taking thereof, to obtain a commission from the clerk of
the court to take the testimony of such witnese or witnesses on
such interroiatories; such exammation may be read on the trial, on 
motion of either of the parties or gamishee, . 
SEc. 21. In all cases of attachment, any person other than the
defendant claiming the property attached, may interplead with-
out giving bail, but the property attached shall not thereby be
replevied; and the court shall immediately (unless good cause be 
shown by either party for a continuance) direct a jury to be
empanneled to inquire into the right of property; in all cases
where the jury find for a claimant, such claimant shall be entitled
to his costs; and where the jury find for the plaintiff in the
attachment, such plaintiff' shall recover hie costs against such
claimant. 
SEc. 22. If judgment by default shall be entered on any attach-
ment against the estate of the defendant, in any court of this state, 
no execution shall issue thereon except against the goods and chat-
tels, lands and tenements, on which the attachment may have been
served, or against a garnishee or garnishees who shall have money
or other property in his or their hands belonging to the defendant
if the defendant shall apl?ear, put in bail and plead to the suit, the
judgment rendered therein shall have the same force and effect as 
if a capios ad re,spondendum had been served on - the person of the
defendant. 
Sze, 23. When any goods and chattels shall be levied on by
virtue of any attachment, and the sheriff or other proper officer, in 
whose custody such goods and chattels are, shall be of opinion that
the same are of a perishable nature, and in danger of immediate
waste and decay, such sheriff or other officer, as aforesaid, shall
summon three respectable freeholders of his county, who shall
examine the goods and chattels so levied on; and if the said free-
holders shall, on oath or affirmation, certify that, in their opinion,
they are of a perishable nature, and in danger of immediate waste
and decay, and if the person or persons to whom such goods and
chattels belong, his, her or their agent or attorney, shall not within
twenty days after serving such attachment, replevy the same, then
such goods and chattels shall be sold at public vendue by the

SEc. 34. This chapter shall be construed in all courts in the
most liberal manner for the detection of fraud.

shall be applicable as well to proceedings in attachment as to
other cases.

attachment, shall be published as is required in cases of original
attachment ; and such publication shall be sufficient to entitle the

manner, to the same extent, and with like effects, as if the suit had
been commenced by attachment. 
SEc. 2. In actions now pending in court, plaintiffs may give the

county in which the court is held; and no counselor or attorney
at law, sheriff, under sheriff, bailiff, or other person concerned in
the execution of process, shall be permitted to be special bail in
any action. 
SEc. 2. In all actions to be commenced in any court of record
in this state, and founded upon any speciality, bill or note in writing, 
or on the judgment of any court, foreign or domestic, and in all
actions of covenant and account, and actions on verbal contracts 
or assumpsits in law, in which the plaintiff or other credible person
can ascertain the sum due, or damages sustained, and that the same
will be in danger of being lost, or that the benefit of whatever
judgment may be obtained will be in danger, unless the defendant
or defendants be held to bail, and shall make affidavit thereof
before the clerk of the court from which proceRs issues, or a jus­
tice of the peace of this state ; or if the plaintiff reside out of this
state, before any judge of a. court of record, or notary public, or
officer of the state or kingdom in which he resides, or [who] may be

during the term to which the writ is returnable, otherwise the
same shall be considered as accepted by the plaintiff. Objections
to tM sufficiency of bail shall be decided by the court in which the
exception is taken, without delay, on such evidence as may be 
produced, and as it may deem satisfactory; the burthen of proof
shall lie on the party affirming the sufficiency, allowing the bail to 
be examined on oath or affirmation, touching his sufficiency.
SEc. 5. It shall be lawful for the defendant in any action in any 
court of record, when bail shall have been given as aforesaid, to

shall be made during the sitting of the court, an entry shall be
made on the records of the court, stating the surrender and com­
mitment of the defendant to the custody of the sheriff; if the
surrender be made in vacation, the bail or principal shall obtain a
certified copy of the bail bond from the sheriff or clerk of the
court, in whosesoever possession the same may be, and shall deliver
himself or be delivered by his bail to such sheriff, who shall there­
upon indorse on such copy of the bail bond an acknowledgment of
the surrender of the body of the defendant to his custody, and
thereupon the said copy of the bond, with such acknowledgment,
shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court hi which the
action is pending. Upon giving notice of the surrender, whether
made in term time or vacation, to the plaintiff or bis attorney, and
paying the costs of the action against the bail, if any have accrued,
the bail shall be discharged from all liability ; the defendant shall
be committed to the jail of the county, there to remain until dis­

execution against the real and personal estate of the defendant. 
SEc. 6. Any defendant surrendered into custody or committed
by his bail, in manner aforesaid, may at any time before final judg­
ment shall have been rendered in the action, discharge himself from
custody by giving other good and sufficient special bail; the sheriff
or other officer authorized to take bail, shall take new bail to the
same effect as is herein before provided.

that the said defendant was not found in his county; if any action 
shall hereafter be commenced upon such bond or recognizance, and
it shall not appear upon the trial thereof that a writ of capias ail
satisf aciendum was issued and returned in the manner herein before
mentioned, a verdict shall be found for the defendant. It shall be
also necessary to charge the bail, that such writ of eapiae ail
satisf 'aciendun» should be issued and delivered, at least ten days
before the return day thereof, to the sheriff of the county, or officer 
to whom it may be directed ; such sheriff or other officer shall
endeavor to serve such writ upon the defendant, any directions
which he may receive from the plaintiff or his attorney to the

any such issue, the death of the principal be found to have happened
before such return day, judgment shall be given in favor of the
defendant; he shall, notwithstanding, be liable to judgment and
execution for the costs of suit, unless such death shall be found to
have taken place before the commencement of the action. 
SEc. 11. If any defendant, having given special bail in any
action, shall afterward be legally arrested and delivered over to
the executive authority of the United States, or of any state or 
territory thereof, upon a charge of having committed a crime out 
of the jurisdiction of this state, and shall be thereupon carried
beyond the limits thereof, such bail shall be discharged from all
liability incurred as bail, if the defendant has not returned to this
state, discharged from such arrest, before he shall be liable to be
charged as bail for such defendant, 
SEc. 12. When any defendant, in any civil action, shall have
been discharged as an insolvent debtor, agreeably to the laws of
this state respecting insolvent debtors, and a certificate from the
authority, lawfully granting the same, shall be produced to the conrt,
the bail of such defendant shall, in all cases, be entitled to have

ment shall not have been recovered against him as the bail of such
defendant.

month or year, in any writ, record or proceeding, or on the same
record where the mistake is committed, is, or are once truly and
rightly alleged, whereunto · the party might have demurred and
shown the same for cause, nor for want of the averment or words
"and this he is ready to verify," or" and tliis he is ready to verifr,
by the record." or for not alleging, " as appears hy the record, '
or that there was no right venue, so as the cause was tried by a
jury of the proper county, or place where the action is laid, nor

with his demurrer, as cause of the same, notwithstanding that such
imperfection, omission or defect might heretofore have been taken
to be matter of substance, so as sufficient matter appear on the
said pleadings upon which the court may give judgment according
to the very right of the cause; and therefore, no advantage or
exception shall be taken of or for an immaterial traverse, of or for
default of entering pledge upon any petition or declaration, or for
the default of alleging the bringing into court any bond, bill,
