draft, receipt, or order, unless he’, she, or they shall make aflidavit of
the truth of such answer at the time of filing the same.1" And the

«petition, answer, return process, judgment, or other proceeding in
}.any civil cause, shall be abated, arrested, quashed or reversed, for
,any defect in matter of form, or for any clerical mistake or omis°sion, not affecting the real merits of the cause ;“ but the Court, on

An Ad to arpluirz and to enforce the J urliciar-y Art of 1799, as respects special pleadings in the several Courts q/'Lqw in this State.Approved Dec. 19, 1818. Vol. III. 384.

IVhereas, the said Judiciary was intended for the purpose of
bringing parties litigant to a speedy Judicial decision, without delay,

and with as little costs as practicable, and it was thereby intended:
that the small omissions of parties, Clerks,‘ or Sheriffs, not affecting
the real merits of the cause, should in all cases (substantially set
out) be amended on motion, without delay or costs, and it having
grown into practice in said Courts to give or grant a term, and sometimes nonsuit,for the smallest omissions of the oflicers of the said Courts,

and as a further increase of the said practice may lead us back to all °

that tedious and expensive labyrinth of special pleadings, which
the said Judiciary intended to avoid;
109. Sac. I. Be it enacted, 6%-. That in every case where
there is a good and legal cause of action, plainly and distinctly set
. forth in the petition, and there is in substance a copy served on the
defendant or defendants, or left at their most notorious place of
abode, every other objection shall be, on motion, amended without
delay or additional costs.
110. Sec. II. No special pleadings shall be introduced or admit'ted in either the Superior or Inferior Courts of this State,’ (other'
than in Equity,) which shall be conducted in the same manner
as is already pointed out by the Judiciary system of this State now
in force, and that every case shall be carried to the Jury, and tried
upon the petition, process, and answer alone, without regard to the
practice, now grown into use in the several Courts of Law in this
State: and no nonsuit shall be awarded when the cause of action is
substantially set forth in the declaration, for any formal variance between the allegafon and proof.”"3
} 111. Sac. III. No part of an answer shall be stricken out or rejected on account of being contradictory to another part of the same
answer, but the Court shall be bound to suffer the whole answer to
remain, if the defendant should desire it, and avail himself of any
advantage he can or may have under either or the whole of the said
answer, and proceed to trial accordingly.

in cases of nonsuit in favor of the party or parties so pleading, and
permit the plaintiff to proceed against the other defendant or defendants to said suit, without further delay or costs.1'

An Act to facilitate the recovery of Personal Property in certain
cases.—-Approved Dec. 24,1827. Vol. IV. 221.

113. Whereas, it frequently happens that suits in the different
Courts of Law and Equity in this State for personal property continue for a number of years, and that after the commencement and
before the end of said suits the property in dispute increases, or has
issue which cannot be recovered in any other way than by resorting to a new action ; for remedy whereof,

114. Be it enacted, That while any suit or action is now pend-I
ing, or may hereafter be instituted in any Court of Law or Equity}
in this State for personal property, the issue of said property born or}
tube born after the commencement of said suit or action, shall and]
may be recovered in the said suit or action ; and it shall be the duty:
of the Court to allow the declaration or bill to be amended at any«
stage of the said suit or action, so as to include the said issue so]

born or to be born; any law, usage, or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

to institute an action on the case for such damages as may have

of joint obligors or joint and several obligors, when a part of them
remove, or are about removing without the jurisdictional limits of

demand is due ;" and all the proceedings shall be as heretofore practised in this State, in restraining the person and property of the defendant until he secures to the complainant the payment of the demand, or shows good cause to the Court why he should not pay the
same—-all other proceedings to be in the same way as practised under this writ in other cases.1'

one or more of them are about to remove without the jurisdictional
limits of this State, and are carrying off their property, leaving one
or more fellow-obligors bound with them for the payment of any
debt, penalty, or for the delivery of property at a certain time, which
time has not arrived at the time of such removal, such obligor or obligors who remain, shall have the benefit of the writ of ne ezeat to
compel the removing obligor to secure the payment of his part of the
debt, penalty, or of the delivery of the property; and also in cases
of security, the security shall have all the benefit of the writ of ne

vexeat against his principal or fellow-security, where the obligation or

debt is not yet due, and the principal or either of the securities are
about removing Without the State: Provided nevertheless, that in
all cases arising under this Act, the party complaining shall pursue

of Property in the Superior and I vzferior Courts of this State.——
This Act passed Dec. 15, 1821. Vol. IV. 207.

Whereas, various constructions have been given in the different
Courts of this State, as it regards claims of property, which tend to
the manifest injury of the community, and frequently produced not
only injustice to the plaintiffs in execution, but evidently to oppress
and harrass them by delays of justice ;

249. See. I. Be it therefore enacted, That when any Sheriff or
Coroner shall levy an executionjj on property claimed by any person
not a party to said execution, such person§ shall make oath to said
property, and it shall be the duty of such Sheriff or Coroner to postpone the sale or future execution of the judgment, until the next.
term of the Court from whence said execution issued: Prot°z'dr:d,
the said execution is or should be levied on personal property; but
should said execution be levied on real property, and the same should
be claimed in manner aforesaid, then and in that case, it shall be the

.duty of the ofheer making the levy upon real property to report the
same, together with the execution and claim, to the next term of the
Superior Court of the County in which the land so levied on shall

lie; and the Court to which such claim shall be reported, shall cause
the right of property to be decided on by a Jury, at the first term, unless special cause be shown to induce said Court to continue the case
for one term, and no longer: Provided, the person claiming such
property, or his agent or attorney, shall give bond to the Sheriif or
Coroner,‘ as the case may be, with good and sufficient security, in a
sum equal to double the amount of the property levied on, at a reasonable valuation, to be judged of by the levying oiiicer, conditioned
to pay the plaintiff all damages which the Jury on the trial of the
right of property may assess against him, in case it should appear
that said claim was made for the purposes of delay ;~ and every Juror on the trial of the claim of property, either real or personal, shall

be sworn, in addition to the oath usually administered,’ to give such

damages, not less than ten per cent,‘ as may seem reasonable and
just, to the plaintilf against the claimant, in.case it shall be sufficiently
shown that said claim was made for delay only; and it shall be lawful
for such Jury to give verdict in marmer aforesaid, by virtue whereof
judgment may be entered up against such claimant and his security
or securities for the damages so assessed by the Jury, and the costs of
the trial of the right of property: And provided also, that the burden of proof shall lie upon the plaintiff in execution in cases where
the property levied on is, at the time of such levy, not in the possesion of the defendant in execution. 9

250. Sec. II. Whenever such claim of property may be made
in terms of this Act, the person claiming property levied on and returned to the proper Court by said Sheriff or Coroner, shall not be
permitted to withdraw or discontinue his said claim, more than once3
without consent and approbation of the plaintiff in execution, or
some person duly authorised to represent such plaintiff, but said
Court shall proceed to the trial of said claim of property in manner
aforesaid, and it shall be the duty of the Jury to award damages accordingly: And provided further, that either party who may be dissatisfied with the verdict of said Jury, may enter his, her or their appeal to a special Jury in the Superior Court of the County where said
trial shall have been had, which appeal shall be subject to the same
rules and regulations as govern in appeals in ordinary cases.

Sec. III. So much of said thirty-second section of the Judiciary Act of 1799, as regards claims of property, which may militate
against this Act, is hereby repealed.

partition of lands and tenements held in coparccna-ry, joint tenancy, and tenancy in common, in this province, and appointing the
method of proceeding therein.—Approved March 26, 1767. Vol.
I. 315.

Wlzereas, it would be inconvenient in this province to pursue the
method of dividing lands and tenements by writ of partition as
practised in Great Britain; and it appears necessary to provide a more
easy and less expensive manner of obtaining partitions:

393. Sec. I. Be it therefore enacted, That in all cases where
any person being of full age are seized of lands in coparcenary, joint

tenancy, or tenancy in common, or where any lands or tenements
shall descend, or be given to any person or persons whatever in coparcenary, joint tenancy, or tenancy in common, and no provision
shall be made by will or otherwise, how such lands or tenements
shall be divided; it shall and may be lawful for such person, being
of full age, or either of them, immediately, and also for any one of

under age, when, and so soon as he or she shall attain the age of
twenty-one years, to apply to the General Court of Pleas, for a writ
of partition, (to be devised and framed in the said .Court according
to the nature of the case, and in case he or she, so coming of e,

such land and tenements, either in entire tracts or parcels, as they shall
judge to be in proportion to the shares claimed and most beneficial
to the several coparceners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, according to the best of their knowledge ; and shall make return there.of under their hands and seals to the said Court within three months
after the issuing of such writ, there to remain of record; which partition or division so to be made shall, by the judgment of the said
Court, be final and conclusive to all the parties concerned, any law,
statute, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided
always, that if the defendant or defendants, or person concerned, or
either of them, against whom, or their ’ ht or title an °ud ment
is given, shall within the space of trvlvgelve monlhs, Yaiitergsuch
judgment is entered; or in case of infancy, coverture, insanity of
mind, or absence out of the rovince, within one car after his her
or their return, on the deterrgination of such inability, apply them-’
selves to. the Court where such judgment is entered, by motion, and
show a good and probable matter in bar of such partition, or that

the dernandant hath not title to so much as he hath recovered; then
and in such case the Court may suspend, or set aside such judgment,
and admit the tenant or tenants to appear and plead; and the cause
shall proceed according to the due course of law, as if no such judgment had been given. And if the Court, upon hearing thereof, shall
adjudge for the first demandant, then the said first judgment shall
stand confirmed, and be good against all persons whatsoever, except
such other persons as shall be absent or disabled as aforesaid ; and
the person or persons so appealing shall be awarded thereupon to
pay costs, or if within such time or times aforesaid, the tenants or
persons concerned, admitting the de1nandant’s title, parts, and purparts, shall show to the Court any inequality in the partition, the,
Court may award a new partition to be made in presence of all parties concerned, (if they will appear,) notwithstanding the return and
filing upon record the former; which said second partition returned
and filed shall be good and firm forever, against all persons whatsoever, except as before excepted.

394. SEC. II. That the persons making such partitions shall be
allowed and paid a reasonable charge for the same. And in case the,
party or parties applying for such writ of partition shall neglect or
refuse to allow and pay such charge, the same shall, upon application,
be settled and awarded by the Court.

province; and appointing the method of proceeding therein, passed
the 26th Marcia, 17’67.—-Approved Dec. 22, 1827. Vol. IV. 219.

Whe1'eas, by the before-recited Act it is made the duty of the Superior Courts in this State, on application for a ~writ of partition, to
appoint eleven persons to perform such duty, which from experience
[proves] to be unnecessarily expensive;

395. Be it enacted, §'c. That from and immediately after the]!
passing of this Act, that whenever a writ of partition shall be grant-.
ed in terms of the before-recited Act, it shall be directed to live free-}
holders of the County where such writ shall issue, and the said free-‘
holders, ora majority of them, shall have full power to perform all
the duties required by the before-recited Act in cases of partition;
and the said freeholders, or a’ majority of them, shall have power to
select a Surveyor to aid them in the discharge of their duties, and the
said freeholders shall be subject to the same rules, regulations, and
restrictions, as are prescribed by the before-recited Acts in all cases
of partition; any law to the contrary notwithstanding.

396. Sec. 1. Be it enacted, That whenever an application shall

be made to any of the Superior Courts of this State for a partition
of lands or tenements, held in joint tenancy, tenancy in common
or in coparcenary, and either of the parties in interest shall, by his
or her affidavit, or other proof, make it satisfactorily appear to the
Court, that a fair and equitable division of said lands and tenements
cannot be made, by metes and bounds, by reason of improvements
made on said lands and tenements, or by reason of the said lands
and tenements being valuable for the erection of mills or machinery
of any kind, or by reason of said lands being valuable for mining
purposes, and in all cases where it shall be made appear to the Court,
that the value of the entire lands and tenements will be depreciated
by such division as aforesaid, that then and in that case, the said Court
shall order a sale of the said lands and tenements, on such just and
equitable terms as it shall prescribe, and order the proceeds to be divided among the several claimants rateably, in proportion to their
respective interests, after deducting the expenses of the proceedings.

397. Sec. II. In all cases where it shall be necessary to make a

'sale of lands or tenements, to effect a just and equitable partition

thereof, it shall be the duty of the Court to appoint three discreet
and proper persons, under such qualifications as it may prescribe, to
make sale of the said lands and tenements, after an advertisement of
thirty days in one of the public gazettes, on the first Tuesday in
the month, at the Court house, in the County in which the said
lands or tenements are situate, and to return their proceedings to the
next following term of the Court.

398. Sec. III. Upon the sale of said lands and tenements as
aforesaid, the said parties in interest, shall make a title to the purchaser, and in case of failure or refusal of them or any of them, the
said persons appointed under the authority of the Court aforesaid, or
any two of them, shall execute a deed of conveyance to the said
lands or tenements to the purchaser or purchasers, which said deed
of conveyance shall be as valid and binding in Law and Equity, as
if it had been made by the parties themselves.

ART. XX. POSSESSORY VVARRANT AND PROCEEDINGS TIIEREOZ\’.1An Act the more efectually to quiet and protect the Ppssession of
Personal Property, and to prevent taking possession by fraud or
violence.—Approved Dec. 25, 1821. Vol. IV. 207.

429. Whe7'eas, a practice hath been followed by some persons
having or laying claims to negroes and other personal property, to
take-or convey away the same by violence, seduction, or other means
or to harbor, or otherwise take, or cause the same to be taken, out

of the possession of the adverse claimant without due course of law,
and oftentimes to remove the same out of the State to the great injury of the true owner; and whereas, manifest injustice, and many
serious mischiefs may arise from such a practice, which is productive
of frauds, violence, and quarrels, and bloodshed,
Sec. IV. Be it therefore enacted, That upon complaint made on 0
oath by the person injured, his agent or attorney, to any Judge of the:
Superior, or Justice of the Inferior Court, or‘ any Justice of the 3'
Peace, that any negro or negroes, or other personal chattel, have ‘C’:
been taken, enticed, or carried away by fraud, violence, seduction‘:
or other means, from the "possession of such deponent, or that such
negroes or other personal chattels having been recently in the quiet, and
legally and peaceably acquired possession of such deponent, have absconded or disappeared without his or her consent, and as he or she
believes, have been harbored, received, or taken possession of, by any
person or persons under some pretended claim or claims, and without
lawful warrant or authority and that the said deponent, or the person for
whom he is agent or attorney bona fide claims a title to or interest
in the said negroes or other chattels, or the possession thereof, it shall
be the duty of such Judge or Justice to issue a warrant, as well for:
the apprehension of the party so seizing, taking, enticing, receiving,r
harboring, obtaining, or having possession of such negroes or other:
chattels, as for the seizure of such negroes or other chattels themselves; i
and upon the return of such warrant the Judge or Justice shall hear;
evidence as to the question of possession in a summary way, and!
cause the said negroes or other chattels to be delivered over to the:
party from whose possession the same were violently or fraudulently‘
taken or enticed away, or from whom the same absconded, or in:
whose peaceable possession they last were: Proridcd, such party}
shall, before such Judge or Justice, enter into a recognizance, with
good and suflicient security, in double the amount of the value of
such negroes or other personal property, and the hire claimed, if any,
to cause the said negroes to be produced and forthcoming, to answer
any judgment, execution, or decree that may be had, issued or made
upon such suit or action at Law or in Equity as the opposite party
may commence or prosecute within the next four years touching the
same; and such recognisance shall be returned by such Judge or Justice to the next Superior Court of the County where the same is taken, to be transmitted to the Court where such suit or action may be
commenced ; and the securities upon such recognisance shall be bound
and liable for the eventual condemnation-money, and execution shall
issue against them in the same manner as against securities on appeals: Provided also, that when the party taking out the warrant
shall refuse or be unable to give such security, then the Judge or
Justice may in his discretion deliver over such negroes or other personal property to the opposite party, upon their entering into a like
recognisance. with security of the same nature and effect, and to be
disposed of in the same manner. And if, upon return of the w
rant, it shall appear that the negroes or other personal property are in
the possession, power, custody or control of the defendant, ‘or any
agent or friend of his or acting for or intrusted with them for him, and

the said defendant doth not produce or cause to be forthcoming the
said negroes or other personal property to be dealt with as the law
directs, the said defendant shallbe committed to jail ; there to remain
in safe and close custody, Without bail or mainprise, until the said
negroes or other personal property shall be produced or forthcoming
I’ to be disposed of, as aforesaid ; Provided always, that no person or
persons shall be so committed for refusing to produce, or cause to be
forthcoming, any negro or other personal chattel which he, she, or
they shall satisfactorily prove to have been in his or her quiet and
peaceable possession for four years next immediately preceding the
passing of this Act, or next immediately preceding the issuing of the

warrant.

431. In all cases where any person or persons hath heretofore
entered himself as security on appeal,‘ or for stay of execution in
any case, in any Court in this State, and may subsequently thereto
have paid off and discharged the execution issuing in such case, it
shall and may be lawful for such security to apply to the Sheriff,
Clerk, Constable, Marshal, or Attorney, to whom such payment may
be made, and procure an entry or certificate to be made on such execution that the same was paid by the security, and such security shall
thereupon be entitled to the use and control of such execution for
the purpose of proceeding against his principal.1'

432. Sec. II. In all cases of appeal where security hath been givcn, and hereafter given, and hereafter to be tried, it shall and may
be lawful for the plaintiff or his attorney to enter up judgment
against the principal and the security, jointly or severally,I and execution shall issue accordingly and proceed against either or both, ‘at the
option of the plaintiff until he is satisfied ;‘ Provided nevertheless, if
the execution against the security or securities be first paid by him
or them, then the execution against the principal shall still be of
force and under the control of the security or securities, until the
same be satisfied by said principal.§

433. Sec. III. Where security shall have been given, or may
hereafter be given for the stay of an execution after judgment, execution shall issue as in cases of appeal against the principal and security, jointly or severally, and proceed and be controlled in like

434. Sac. IV. When any person or persons hath heretofore or
shall hereafter become bail on recognizance, or security on bond,
note, or other contract, and shall be sued thereon, it shall and may
be lawful for such bail or security on the trial of such case to make

special defence ;’ and in case it should appear to the Court that one‘

or more of the defendants is or are securities only, and not interested in the consideration of the contract sued on, then and in such
case verdict and judgment shall be entered accordingly, and further
proceedings had, and privileges exercised as hereinbefore prescribed
in behalf of the other securities; Provided, the plaintiff shall in no

I

case be delayed by any dispute which may arise between the defendants, but the Court shall decide the issues and the verdict which may

. judgment has been rendered against him or them, and execution has

been issued accordingly, in which they may be able to show that he
or they were security only, and as such hath or have been" paid off
and discharged such execution, such security or securities shall have
the benefit thereof, and power to control the same, for the purpose
of indemnifying himself or themselves out of the pro} erty of the
principal. .

_ 436. Sec. VI. When any security to any note, bond, or obligation, shall subscribe himself as security, such statement appended to
his name on the said note, bond, or obligation, shall be held and taken as good evidence of his being such security, and the plaintiff shall

437'. From and after the passage of this Act, that the practice
heretofore required of making a demand of the makers of promissory notes and other instruments. for the payment and performance
of the same, and their giving notice of such demand within a reasonahle time to the ends.-rsers of said promissory notes and other instruments,‘ shall cease and become entirely unnecessary to bind said
.endorsers, and whenever any person whatever endorses a promis‘sory note or other instrument, he shall be held, taken, and considered as security to the same, and he in all respects bound as security,
until said promissory note or other instrument is paid off and discharged,‘‘’ and shall be liable to be sued in the same manner and in
the same action with the principal or maker of said promissory notes
or other instruments; any law, practice, or usage to the contrary

438. Sec. II. Any security or endorser may, Whenever he thinks
proper, after the note or instrument becomes due, require the holder to
proceed to collect the same ; and if he should not proceed to do so

TVlzercas, doubts exist whether the security or securities, against
whom judgment has been rendered, and execution has issued accordingly, upon any contract, bond or note, since the passage of the
above—recitcd Act, .can have legally the control of the execution
where the sfvne l11S bee;1 paid elf by such security or securities, and
they have neglected to make special defence at the trial, to indemnify themselves out of the property of the principal; for remedy
whereof,

it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons, who have here- ,

was the foundation of the judgment and execution.

410. Where any security or securities as aforesaid, shall fail at
the trial of the note, bond, or other instrument upon which he, she,
or they, were security or securities. to make special defence thereof, it shall be lawful for such security or securities to take control

An Act declaring and nmking certain the law defining the liability
of endorsers and securities to promissory notes and o.‘her instruments, when the holder thereq/ shall fail to proceed to collect the
same after notz'ce.——Approved Dec. 26, 1831. Pam. 136.

Whereas, the Legislature of this State, did on the twenty-sixth
of December, 1826, pass an Act, entitled “an Act, to dehne the liability of endorsers of promissory notes and other instruments, and to
place them upon the same footing with securities,” by the second
section of which Act, it is provided, that “ any security or endorser
may whenever he thinks proper, after the note or instnunent becomes due, require the holder to proceed to collect the same, and if
he should not proceed to do so within three months, the endorser or
security shall be no longer liable ;” And whereas, the constitutionality
of said second section is doubted, by reason of its departure from
the title of said bill ; for remedy whereof,

44!. Be it enacted, That in every case which may hereafter arise,
where the security or endorser of any promissory note or other in’strument, after the same has or shall become due, has required or
'shall hereafter require the holder thereof to proceed to collect the
'same, and the said holder has not proceeded or shall not proceed to
‘do so, within three months after such notice or requisition, the endorser or security shall be no longer liable.‘

judgments or executions, he, she, or they shall be entitled to the full
control of each and every judgment or execution that shall or may
be founded upon the same instrument as against the makers thereof,
and all prior eudorsers thereon, for the purpose of reimbursing and

' 443. W’herea.s, great inconvience arises, and often great injustice done
to individuals being parties in execution, under the existing law, as
co-securities—for the fact, that whereas one security (as the case
may be) having been compelled under execution to pay the debt or
obligation of his principal, is not allowed to control or collect by
said execution, each security’s proportionable part of said execution
so paid, but must proceed by an action at law; for remedy whereof,

See. I. Be it enacted, That from and immediately after the pas-:
age of this Act, any security (who may be sued together with oth-,‘
er securities) shall pay or discharge any execution or executions}
issued against principal or co-securities, shall, after an entry is made‘
on the said executions by the collecting officer, that the same has
been well and truly paid by said security, then and in such cases,
the said security so paying or discharging said execution [shall have
control thereof] against each co-security who may have been made a
party to said suit, for the proportionable part equitably due by each,
and no more ;"’ Provided nevertheless, that all should be equally responsible ; if not, then to be equally divided or paid by those who are.’

444. Sec. II. Any execution so paid or satisfied by two or more se-'
curities, shall be held as the joint property of said securitie against all]
the parties equally concerned for their proportionable part.

445. Sec. III. After payment and entry made, as herein prescribed, .
it shall be the duty of the otiicer making the entry to deliver said}
execution to the security who shall have made the payment, to be
used and controlled as herein mentioned.

Provided always, that it shall be made satisfactorily appear to the
Court where said judgment was rendered, that such person, or persons assiuning to have the control of any judgment as aforesaid,

omitted to sign the original note or contract as security, and also neglected to make special defence at the trial of the same, showing him
or themselves security on the original contract, and against whom
executions have issued, and who have been compelled to pay off the
same, can have control of the same for the purpose of reimbursing
him or themselves out of the property of the co-securities :*

immediately after the passage of this Act, any security who may:
have been, or who may hereafter be suedas such, with other co~securities, and against whom execution may have been, or may be issued, and who may have been, or may hereafter be compelled to

that the same has been well and truly paid by such security, have
control of the execution or executions for the purpose of reimbursing him or themselves proportionably, out of the property of the
co-security or securities

449. Sec. II. Any security who may have been or may be suedj
together with other securities, and who have omitted or may omits
to sign the original note or contract as security, and who when suede
have neglected or may neglect to make special defence at the trial,‘
showing himself or themselves security on the original contract, andagainst whom execution has issued or may issue, and who have been

Court that he or they are security or securities on the execution or executions, and after which, and upon having an entry made by the
collecting officer, on the execution or executions, that the same has
been well and truly paid by said security or securities, then and in
such cases, said security or securities so paying off and discharging
said execution or executions, shall have control of the same for thepurposc of collecting by levy and sale from each co-security so sued‘;
together, or such as may be responsible, the proportionable share
due by each upon such execution or executions: Provided never‘llreless, that if any should not be responsible, then the amount so
