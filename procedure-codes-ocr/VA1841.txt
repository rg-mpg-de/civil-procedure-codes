wherein bail may not lawfully be demanded, the plaintiff or his attorney shall,
on pain of having his suit di missed with costs,( b) endorse, on the original 
writ or subsequent process, the true species of action, anil that bail is not re­

execution thereof; and, in the cases before mentioned, the sheriff may take the
engagement of an attorney practising in the court, from which the process
issued, endorsed on the writ, that he will appear for the defendant or defen­
dants, and such appearance shall be entered with the clerk in the office on the
return day of the writ. And although no such engagement of an attorney
shall be offered to the sheriff, he shall nevertheless be restrained from commit­
ting the defendant to prison, or detaining him in his custody, for want of ap­
pearance bail, but the sheriff in such case shall return the writ executed; and
if the defendant shall fail to appear thereto, there shall be the like proceeding
against him only, as is hereinafter directed against defendants and their ap­
pearance bail, where such is taken. Nov. 1645, act 14, I &at. Larg, 305;

bail is required, it shall then he the duty of the sheriff to take bail accord­

general court, or any justice of the peace for any county or corporation, upon 
proper affidavit,(d) verifying the justice of the plaintiff's action, and shewing
probable cause to apprehend that the defendant will depart from the jurisdic­

bail bond or a copy thereof,(/) to the clerk's office, on the day of appearance.fa,)
And if the defendant shall fail to appear accordingly, and give special bail,(g)
the bail for appearance may defend the suit,(k) and shall be subject to the
same judgment and recovery ,(3) as the defendant might or would be subject
to, if he had appeared and given special bail. If the sheriff shall not return
bail(i) and the bail bond, or a copy thereof, and the defendant shall fail to ap­
pear and give special bail, in such case the sheriff shall have like liberty of de­
fence, and shall be subject to the same judgment and recovery, as is provided in
the case of appearance bail. If the bail, returned by the sheriff, be objected to
by the plaintiff, and be adjudged insufficient by the court,lj) and the defendant
shall fail to give special bail, the sheriff shall thereupon beconsidered a party
to the proceedings ; and, without remanding the cause to the rules, he, toge­
ther with the appearance bail, shall be subject to the same judgment and re­
covery, that the appearance bail alone would have been subject to, and shall
be entitled to the same defence. Nov. 1645, Act 14, 1 Stat. Larg. 305;

tion of such bail or sheriff, or executors or administrators, or other person
on behalf of the estate of such sheriff or bail, may order an attachment against
the estate of such defendant or defendants, returnable to the next succeeding 
court, and upon the eecution and return of such attachment, the court shall 
order the estate seized, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the
judgment and costs, and all costs accruing under the attachment, to be sold as
goods taken in execution upon a fei facias ; and, out of the money, such
judgment and costs shall be satisfied, and the surplus, if any, restored, to the 
defendant or defendants, when required. Act Nov. 1645, 1 Stat. Larg. 305;

permission to plead, or may set aside any plea already pleaded by him, and

had been entered and accepted. But the defendant shall not be discharged
out of custody, until he shall put in good bail, or the plaintiff shall be ruled
by the court to accept an appearance without bail. And, when any defendant,
after appearance entered, shall be confined in prison, the plaintiff may proceed
in the same manner as if he were not so confined. Prom Feb. 1727, c. 3, 4

capias, where the defendant shall have gone into another county or corpora­

the defendant, to force an appearance ; and if the sheriff or other officer shall
return that he hath attached any goods, and the defendant shall not appear and
replevy the same, by entering his appearance and giving special bail, in case
he shall be ruled so to do, the plaintiff may file his declaration, and proceed to 
final judgment, in the same manner as if the defendant had been arrested.( I) 
The goods attached shall remain in the' hands of the officer, until such final
judgment be entered, and then be sold in the same manner as goods taken

or other process be awarded, the sheriff shall not execute such subsequent pro­
cess, but shall return the first process by him executed, if it be in his posses­

process, with an endorsement of the execution of such first process, and the
name of the appearance bail, if any was taken; and shall also return a copy
of the bail bond, on which there shall be the same proceedings, as if the said

clamation shall be published on three successive court days, at the door of
the courthouse of the county or corporation, to which the last process was

the age of sixteen years, then and there being one of the family of the defen­
