property, with or without damages for the withholding
thereof, and for injuries to the property withheld ;
Fifth. Claims to recover the possession of real property,
with or without damages, rents and profits for the with
holding thereof, and for waste or damage done to the land ;
to make partition of and to determine and quiet the title to
real property ;
Sixth. Claims to enforce the specific performance of
contracts, and to avoid contracts for fraud or mistakes ;
Seventh. Claims to foreclose mortgages ; to enforce or
discharge specific liens ; to recover personal judgment upon
the debt secured by such mortgage or lien ; to subject to
sale real property upon demands against decedents estates,
wrhen such property has passed to heirs, devisees or their
assigns ; to marshal assets ; and to substitute one person to
the rights of another ; and all other causes of action arising
out of a contract or a duty, and not falling within either of
the foregoing classes ; but causes of actipn so joined must
affect all the parties to the action, and not require different
places of trial, and must be separately stated and numbered.
(70.)
Sec. 107. When the plaintiff desires to recover the
possession of title papers, or other instruments of writing,
or correct any mistakes therein, a separate action may be
brought therefor ; or the possession of such title papers, or
other instruments of writing, may be recovered, or mistakes
corrected, in any other action, when such recovery or cor
rection would be essential to a complete remedy. (71.)
Sec. 108. When the action arises out of contract, the
plaintiff may join such other matters in his complaint as
may be necessary for a complete remedy, and a speedy sat
isfaction of his judgment, although such other matters fall
within some other one or more of the forgoing classes.
When several causes of action arc united, belonging to any
of the foregoing classes, the Court may order separate trials
for the furtherance of justice. (72.)
[Rules of Pleading.]
Sec. 109. Every pleading in a Court of record must
be subscribed by the party, or his attorney. (73.)
Sec. 110. Every material allegation of the complaint,
not controverted by the answer, and every material allega
tion of new matter in the answer, not controverted by the
reply, shall, for the purpose of the action, be taken as true,
but the allegations of new matter in a reply are to be
deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require. Allegations
of value, or amount of damages, shall not be considered as
true by the failure to controvert them, but in actions upon
account, in which an itemized bill of particulars, the cor
rectness of which is duly affirmed or sworn to by the
plaintiff, or some one in his behalf, has been filed with the
complaint, a default, by the defendant, shall be deemed to
admit the correctness of the bill of particulars, as sworn or
affirmed to, and judgment may be rendered thereon with
out further evidence. (74.)
Sec. 111. Pleadings sworn to by either party in any case
shall not on the trial be deemed proof of the facte alleged
therein, nor require other or greater proof on the part of
the adverse party, than those not sworn to except as herein
or otherwise by law provided. (75.)
Sec. 112. When the pleadings show sufficient excuse
for not admitting or denying an allegation, such excuse op
erates as a denial of the truth of the allegation, and to re
quire its proof. (76.)
Sec. 113. When any pleading is founded on a written
instrument or on account, the original, or a copy thereof,
must be filed with the pleading. A set off or counter
claim is within the meaning of this section. Such copy of
a written instrument, when not copied in the pleadings,
shall be taken as part of the record. The account, if the
items are numerous, shall not be copied in the pleadings,
nor be deemed to be part of the record, unless by order of
the Court. Any variance between any pleading and copy
of a written instrument filed as to matter of description or
legal effect, may be amended at any time (as of course) be
fore judgment, without causing a continuance. (78.)
Sec. 114. The Court, on motion, may order a further
bill of particulars, when the one filed is defective; and
may, in all proper cases, upon motion, order a bill of par
ticulars of the claim of either party, and abstracts of title
to be furnished. (79.)
Sec. 115. When a pleading is founded on a written
instrument, or such instrument is therein referred to, or
when an assignment in writing of such instrument is
specially alleged in a pleading, such instrument or assign-
ment may be read in evidence on the trial of the cause
without proving its execution, unless its execution be de
nied by pleading under oath, or by an affidavit filed with
the pleading denying the execution. And when a written
instrument, or assignment, is so pleaded or referred to, proof
of the names of the makers, assignors, obligors, assignees,
payees, or obligees shall not be necessary, unless the same
shall be denied by a pleading under oath or by an affidavit
filed as aforesaid. The oath, in case that the time of assign
ment is questioned, shall be that the party has reason to
believe, and does believe, that the assignment was not made
before the suit was commenced ; but executors, administra
tors, or gnardiaps, need not deny the execution of an instru
ment or the assignment thereof, under oath, but the same
must be proved as if it were so denied. The party shall,
in all cases, be entitled to an inspection of the instrument
in writing, before pleading thereto. (80.)
Sec. 116. Pleadings denying the jurisdiction of the
Court, or in abatement of the action, and all dilatory
pleadings, must be supported by affidavit. The character,
or capacity in which a party sues or is sued, and the au
thority by virtue of which he sues, shall require no proof
on the trial of the cause, unless such character, capacity or
authority, be denied by a pleading under oath, or by an
affidavit filed therewith. An answer in abatement must
precede, and can not be pleaded with an answer in bar, and
the issue thereon must be tried first and separately. If the
issue be found against the answer, the judgment must be
that the party plead over, and against him for all costs of
the action up to that time.
Sec. 117. A failure or want of consideration, in whole
or in part, may be pleaded to any action, set-oft', or counter
claim upon, or arising out of any specialty bond or deed,
except instruments negotiable by the law merchant, and
negotiated before falling due. (81.)
Sec. 118. In any action or defense, founded upon a
bill or note, or other contract, for the payment of money
a(. a particular place, it shall not be necessary to aver or
prove a demand at the place, but the opposite party may
show a readiness to pay such demand at the proper place.
(82.)
Sec. 119. In pleading a judgment or decision of a
Court, or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall be sufficient
to allege generally, that the judgment or decision was duly
given or made. If the allegation be denied, the facts con
ferring jurisdiction must be proved on the trial. (83.)
Sec. 120. In pleading the performance of a condition
precedent in a contract, it shall be sufficient to allege gen
erally, that the party performed all the conditions on his
part. If the allegation be denied, the facts showing a per
formance must be proved on the trial. (84.)
Sec. 121. In pleading a private statute or aright de
rived therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such
statute by its title and the day of its approval, and the
Court shall take judicial notice thereof. (85.)
Sec. 122. In an action for libel or slander it shall be
sufficient to state generally that the defamatory matter pub
lished or spoken was of the plaintiff; and if the allegation
be denied, the plaintiff must prove on the trial the facts,
showing that the defamatory matter was published or spoken
of him. (86.)
Sec. 123. In all actions mentioned in the last section,
the defendant may allege the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory, and mitigating circumstances to reduce the
damages, and give either or both in evidence. (87.)
Sec. 124. Neither presumptions of law, nor matters of
which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in a plead-
ing. (88.)
Sec. 125. In an action to recover the possession of
property distrained doing damage, an answer that the de
fendant, or person by whose command he acted, was law
fully possessed of the real property upon which the distress
was made, and that the property distrained was at the time
doing damage thereon, shall be good, without setting forth
the title of such real property. (89.)
Sec. 126. In the construction of a pleading, for the
purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice be
tween the parties; but when the allegations of a pleading
are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the
large or defense is not apparent, the Court may require
le pleading to be made definite and certain by amend
ment. (90.)
Sec 127. Under a mere denial of any allegation, no
vidence shall be introduced, which does not tend to negaive
what the party making the allegation is bound to
trove. (91-)
Sec. 128. All fictions in pleading are abolished, and
lieir use forbidden in the courts of justice in this State.
[92.)
Sec. 129. If an original pleading or paper be lost, or
â  lL, ill 6 lL rn a fu â¢
withheld by any person, the Court may authorize a copy
thereof to be filed and used instead of the original. (93.)
[Variances and Amendments.]
Sec. 130. No variance, between the allegations in a
pleading and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it
have actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in
maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. When
ever it is alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact
must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and it must
be shown in what respect he has been misled, and, there
upon, the Court may order the pleading to be amended on
such terms as may be just. (94).
Sec. 131. Where the variance is not material, as provided
in the last section, the Court may direct the fact to
be found according to the evidence, or may order an im
mediate amendment without costs. (95.)
Sec. 132. When, however, the allegation of the claim
or defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not
in some particular or particulars only, but in its general
scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of vari
ance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
(96.)
Sec. 133. Any pleading may be amended by either
party, of course, at any time, before the pleading is answered.
All other amendments shall be by leave of the
Court. The party amending shall pay the costs of the
leave to amend. When the trial is not delayed by reason
of the amendment, no other costs shall be taxed. When
the amendment causes a delay during any part of the term,
or to another term, the party amending shall pay the costs
of such delay. No cause shall be delayed by reason of an
amendment, excepting only the time to make up issues, but
upon good cause shown by affidavit of the party or his
agent asking such delay. (97.)
Sec. 134. The affidavit shall show distinctly in what
respect the party asking the delay has been prejudiced in
his preparation for trial by the amendment. When the
action is continued for such cause, the party asking the
delay shall file his pleadings at such time as the Court may
direct. (98.)
Sec. 135. The Court may, at any time, in its discretion,
and upon such terms as may be deemed proper, for the
furtherance of justice, direct the name of any party to be
added or struck out, a mistake in name, description, or le
gal effect, or in any other respect, to be corrected, any ma
terial allegation to be inserted, struck out or modified, to
conform the pleadings to the facts proved, when the amend
ment does not substantially change the claim or defense.
The Court may also, in its discretion, allow a party to file
his pleadings after the time limited therefor; and shall re
lieve a party from a judgment taken against him, through
his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,
and supply an omission in any proceedings on complaint
or motion filed within two years. (99.)
Sec. 136. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name
oÂ£. tjie defendant, such defendant may be designated in any
pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true
name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be
amended accordingly, either before or after service of the
summons. (100.)
Sec. 137. The Court must in every stage of the action
disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceed
ings which does not affect the substantial rights of the ad
verse party, and no judgment can be reversed or affected
by reason of such error or defect. (101.)
Sec. 138. The Court may, on motion, allow supple-
mental pleadings, showing facts which occurred after the
former pleadings were filed. (102.)

be made by the Court in term time, in which the action is

fendant, and stating that be believes the defendant is about

cution, or money or effects which should be applied to the

defraud the plaintiff. (104.)
Sec. 141. The order of arrest shall not be issued until
there has been executed and filed in the office of the Clerk
of such Court, by one or more sufficient sureties of the
plaintiff, to be approved by the Clerk or Court making the
order, a written undertaking to the effect that the plaintiff
shall pay to the defendant all damages which he may sus

tained, not exceeding double the amount of the plaintiff's
claim stated in the affidavit. (105.)
Sec. 142. The order of arrest shall be addressed and
delivered to the Sheriff. It shall state the names of the
parties to the action, the Court in which the action is

ness shall, on behalf of the executor, administrator or heirs,

gatories annexed thereto, requiring him to cause the wit
ness to come before him at such time and place as he may
appoint, and to faithfully take his deposition, upon the
questions annexed to the commission, and, thereupon, to
make return to the Court of his doings under such commis
sion, without delay. The officer shall first swear or affirm the
witness, that he will make a true, full and perfect a/iswer
to the interrogatories to be propounded to him, and then he
shall propound the interrogatories annexed to the commis
sion in their order, and accurately write the answers of the
witness to such. He shall then read carefully to the wit
ness such interrogatories and his answers thereto, and cor
rect the answers as the witness may desire, and then the
witness shall sign such deposition. Neither the parties,
their agents or attorneys, shall be present, nor shall they,
or any of them, be informed of the nature of the evidence

and answers, securely sealed, and transmit the same, ad
dressed to the Clerk of the Court in which the suit is
pending, with the title of the cause indorsed thereon : Pro
vided, however, If the party served with notice, as in this section provided, shall prefer to cross-examine the witness
orally, he shall notify the opposite party of such election
within three days after receiving notice, and, in that case,

sealed and unsealed writings ; and every writing not
sealed, shall have the same force and effect that it would
have if sealed. A writing under seal, except conveyances
of real estate, or any interest therein, may, therefore, be

any other witness, to testify either at the trial, or condi
tionally, or upon commission. (295.)
Sec. 347. The examination, instead of being had at fte
trial, may be had at any time before the trial, at the option

the answer to the interrogatories may be used on the trial
or not, at the option of the party requiring it : Provided,
That in the absence of such opposite party, the filing of the
interrogatories shall not work a continuance of the cause,
unless it be shown to the Court, by affidavit, that the party
who files such interrogatories, expects to elicit facts by the
answer, material to him on the trial, that he believes such
facts to be true, that he can not prove the same by any
witness, and that he files the interrogatories, not for delay
merely, but to obtain substantial justice at the trial. (383.)
[Production and Inspection of Writings.]
Sec. 352. If either party, at any time before trial, allow
the other an inspection of any writing, material to the
action, whether mentioned in the pleadings or not, and de
liver to him a copy thereof, with notice that he intends to

Sec. 355. In any civil action, where the parties are entitled to a trial by jury, and either party shall demand such
trial, the Sheriff shall call a jury from the regular panel,
except as hereinafter provided. (307.)
Sec. 356. The number of jurors to try a civil action
shall not exceed twelve, nor be less than three. The par
ties may determine the number of jurors by agreement, and
in case of their disagreement the number shall be twelve.
(308.)
Sec. 357. The parties may agree upon the jurors to
compose a special jury, and notify the Court thereof, and the
Court shall thereupon direct the Sheriff to empanel such
special jury, if it can be done without unreasonable de
lay of the cause. (309.)
Sec. 358. When both parties desire it, the Court may
direct the Sheriff to summon eighteen competent jurors, or
a less number, and the plaintiff first, and then the defendant,
shall strike out one juror in turn, until each has struck
off six or more, and the remaining jurors shall try the cause ;
or the parties, when they consent, upon being furnished
with a list of jurors to be summoned, may exercise the
right to strike out any part of the names before the jurors
are summoned, and the remaining jurors only shall be
summoned. (310.)
Pec. 369. Whenever a struck jury shall be deemed
â¢ M â¢ /V -j.
necessary for the trial of any civil cause in any Circuit or
Superior Court of this State, it shall be lawful for either
party to file with the Clerk, a demand for such jury, when
it shall be the duty of such Clerk to give four days' notice
to both parties, or to their attorneys, of the time of strik
ing the same ; at the time designated, said Clerk shall at
tend at his office, and in the presence of the parties, or of
such of them as shall attend for that purpose, shall select
from the number of persons qualified to serve as jurors
within the county, forty such persons as he shall think
most indifferent between the parties, and best qualified to
try such cause; and then the party requiring such jury, his
agent or attorney, shall first strike off one of the names,
and then the opposite party, his agent or attorney, another,
and so on, alternately, until each shall have struck out
twelve. If either party shall not attend in person, or by
attorney, it shall be the duty of the Clerk to strike out for
the party not attending. When each party shall have
stricken out twelve names as aforesaid, the Clerk shall
make a fair copy of the names of the remaining sixteen
persons, and immediately thereafter, issue process, directing
the Sheriff of the county, to summons said sixteen persons,
as jurors struck for the trial of such cause, stating the day
for which it is set for trial, and such Sheriff shall, there
upon, summon accordingly ; but, in all cases, it shall be
necessary to strike such jury at least five days previous to
the day at which said case is set for trial on the docket,
and two days' service of the process by the Sheriff, shall
be held sufficient. And, upon the trial of the cause, the
jury so struck shall be called as they stand upon the panel,
and the first twelve of them who shall appear, and are not
challenged for cause or set aside by the Court, shall be the
jury, and shall be sworn to try said issue: Provided, how
ever, That, unless at least one-half of such struck jury
shall have been summoned, and shall be in attendance when
such cause is called for trial, the case shall be tried by the
regular petit jury, as other cases. (1.)
Sec. 360. That if the Clerk of such Court shall be interested
in the cause, or related to either of the parties, or
do not stand indifferent between them in every such case,
the Judge entitled to try said cause may, in vacation or
term time, name some judicious and disinterested person to
strike the jury, and to do and perform all things required
to be done by such Clerk relating to the striking of such
jury. (2.)
Sec. 361. The party requiring such struck jury shall
pay the fees for striking the same, and one dollar and
twenty-five cents each day for each juror so attending, and
shall not have an allowance therefor in the taxation of costs,
unless the Court shall be of opinion that the cause required
such special jury, in which last case the extraordinary ex
pense shall be taxed in the bill of costs. If the Court,
upon motion of either party, shall have ordered a struck
jury, then the costs thereof shall abide the event of the
suit. (3.)
Sec. 362. A struck jury for the trial of the cause at
anv term Â°f tne Court may be continued with the continu
ance of the cause, and be summoned in as jurors at a sub
sequent term, provided both parties consent thereto, but.
not otherwise. (4.)
Sec. 363. It shall be sufficient cause for challenge to a
juror, that he is interested in another suit, begun or con
templated, involving the same or a similar matter. (311.)
Sec. 364. Before the commencement of the trial an
oath must be administered to each juror, that he will well
and truly try the matter in issue between the parties, and
a true verdict give, according to law and evidence. (312.)
Sec. 365. In all cases where the jury consists of six
or more persons> each party shall have three peremptory
challenges. (313.)
Sec. 366. When the regular panel is exhausted, or is
insufficient from any cause, the Sheriff shall call the by
standers, or fill the jury in such a manner as the Court may
direct. (314.)
[Trial and Its Incidents.]
Sec. 367. Every action shall stand for issue and trial
^ ^ term after js commenced, where the summons
has been served on the defendant ten days, or publication
has been made for thirty days before the first day of the
term : Provided, however, That when the complaint is filed,
whether before or during any term of Court, the plaintiff
may fix the day during such term, by endorsement thereof
upon the complaint at the time of filing the same, on which
the defendant shall appear, which day, when so fixed, shall
be stated in the summons when issued, and the action shall
be docketed in its order. And if summons shall be per
sonally served ten days before such day, or publication
shall be made three weeks, thirty days before such day,
such action shall thereupon stand for issue and trial at such
term, and the Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and de
termine such action, as if summons had been served, or
publication made before the first day of the term, as here
inbefore provided. And if at any time, after the filing of
the complaint, it shall be found that any party to the action
has not been properly notified, the plaintiff* may file with
the Clerk, or endorse on the complaint, a written request
for such notice to be given, naming therein the day of the
pending or subsequent term, on which such party is re
quired to appear to the action ; and summons shall be issued
or publication made accordingly in the proper cases as
above provided. And if summons shall be personally
served ten days before such day, or publication made three
weeks successively thirty days before such day, such case
shall thereupon stand for issue and trial at such term, and
the Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine
such action as if summons had been served, or publication
made before the first day of the term as hereinbefore pro
vided. (315.)
[Jsswes.]
Sec. 368. Issues arise on the pleadings, where a fact, or i
conclusion of law, is maintained by one party, and contro- k

-Second. Of fact. (316.)
Sec. 369. An issue of law arises upon demurrer to the
complaint, answer or reply, or to some part thereof. (317.)
Sec. 370. An issue of fact arises :
First. Upon a material allegation, in the complaint,
denied by the answer.
Second. Upon material new matter, in the answer, de
nied by the reply.
Third. Upon material new matter in the reply, which
shall be considered as controverted by the opposite party
without further pleading. (318.)
Sec. 371. The trial is a judicial examination of the
issues, whether by law or of fact, in an action. (319.)
Sec. 372. Issues of law and issues of fact in causes
that, prior to the 18th day of June, 1852, were of exclusive
equitable jurisdiction, shall be tried by the Court, issues of
fact in all other causes shall be triable as the same are now
triable. In case of the joinder of causes of action or de
fenses, which prior to said date were of exclusive equitable
jurisdiction, with causes of action or defenses which prior
to said date were designated as actions at law and triable
by juryâthe former shall be triable by the Court, and the
latter by a jury, unless waived ; the trial of both may be
at the same time or at different times, as the Court may
direct: Provided, That in all cases triable by the Court as
above directed, the Court iii its discretion for its informa
tion, may cause any question of fact to be tried by a jury,
or the Court may refer any such cause to a master commis
sioner for hearing and report. (320.)
Sec. 373. The trial in each action shall be in the order
in which it stands upon the docket, unless the Court, for
good cause shown, shall direct otherwise. (321.)
Sec. 374. A motion to postpone the trial on account of
the absence of evidence, can be made only upon affidavit,
showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be ob
tained, and that due diligence has been used to obtain it ;
and where the evidence may be ; and if it is for an absent
witness, the affidavit must show the name and residence of
the witness, if known, and the probability of procuring
the testimony within a reasonable time, and that his ab
sence has not been procured by the act or connivance of
the party, nor by others at his request, nor with his
knowledge and consent, and what facts he believes the wit
ness will testify to, and that he believes them to be true, and
that he is unable to prove such facts by any other witness
whose testimony can be as readily procured. If, there
upon, the adverse party will consent that, on the trial, the
facts shall be taken as true, if the absent evidence is writ
ten or documentary, and, in case of a witness, that he will
testify to said facts as true, the trial shall not be postponed
for that cause, and, in such case, the party against whom
such evidence is used, shall have the right to impeach such
absent witness, as in case where the witness is present, or
his deposition is used. (322.)
Sec. 375. Any Court, for good cause shown, may con-
tinue any action at any stage of the proceedings, at the
cost of the applicant, to be paid as the Court shall direct:
Provided, That if, by reason of an amendment to the
pleadings, a party who would otherwise be ready for trial
be compelled to obtain a continuance, it shall be at the costs
of the party making the amendment. (323.)
[Trial by Jury.\
Sec. 376. When the jury has been sworn, the trial
shall proceed in the following order, unless the Court, for
special reasons, otherwise directs :

he expects to sustain it.
Second. The adverse party may then briefly state his
defense and the evidence he expects to offer in support of it.
Third. The party on whom rests the burden of the
issues must first produce his evidence; the adverse party
will then produce his evidence, which may then be rebutted.
Fourth. When the evidence is concluded, and either
party desires special instructions to be given to the jury,
such instruction shall be reduced to writing, numbered and
signed by the party or his attorney asking the same, and
delivered to the Court.
Fifth. When the argument of the cause is concluded,
the Court shall give general instructions to the jury, which
shall be in writing, and be numbered and signed by the
Judge, if required by either party.
Sixth. Where either party asks special instructions to
be given to the jury, the Court shall either give each in
struction as requested, or positively refuse to do so; or,
give the instructions with a modification, in such manner
that it shall distinctly appear what instructions were given,
in whole or in part, and in like manner, those refused, so
that either party may except to the instructions, as asked
for, or as modified, or to the modification. All instructions
given by the Court must be signed by the Judge, and
filed, together with those asked for by the parties, as a part
of the record. The instructions shall not be entered at
large on the final record, unless either party may wish to
remove the cause to a superior Court. (324)
Sec. 377. Upon the trial of any civil cause before a s
jury in any Circuit or Superior Court of this State, any
party thereto, having an interest in the result of such trial,
may, before the commencement of the argument to the jury,
tender to the Court instructions in writing, properly num
bered, to be given to the jury, and require the Court to in
dicate before the argument, such as will be given, by writ
ing opposite each the words " given," " given as modified
by the Court," or " refused." And if the Court desires, he
may hear argument thereon by the respective counsel, be
fore acting on the instructions tendered. And thereupon,
during the argument to the jury, any instructions so indi
cated to be given, may be read to the jury as the law of
the case, and the Court shall give the same to the jury
as the law when such jury is instructed by the Court.
And the Court may of its own motion, and shall, upon ap
plication of either party, also before the commencement of
the argument, lay before the parties any instructions prop
erly numbered, which it will give to the jury, and there
upon the same may be read by any one as the law, while
making an argument to the jury : Provided, however, The
Court may give to the jury such other instructions, with
those already approved, at the close of the argument as
may be necessary to fully present the law to the jury and
secure the ends of justice. (1.)
Sec. 378. A party excepting to the giving of instruc
tions, or the refusal thereof, shall not be required to file a
formal bill of exceptions ; but it shall be sufficient to write
on the margin, or at the close of each instruction, "refused
and excepted to," or " given and excepted to," which mem
orandum shall be signed by the Judge and dated. (325.)
Sec. 379. The parties may either submit or argue the
case to the jury. In the argument, the party having the
burden of the issue shall have the opening and closing;
but shall disclose in the opening all the points relied on in
the cause ; and if, in the closing, he refer to any new point
or fact not disclosed in the opening, the adverse party shall
have the right of replying thereto, which reply shall close

quested by either party, to take brief notes of the evidence
of the parties in the order in which the same is introduced
on the trial. (327.)
Sec. 381. Whenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is
proper for the jury to have a view of real or personal prop
erty which is the subject of litigation, or of the place in
which any material fact occurred, it may order them to be
conducted in a body, under the charge of a sworn officer, to
the place, which shall be shown to them by some person
appointed by the Court for that purpose. While the jury
are thus absent, no person, other than the person so ap
pointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with
the trial. (328.)
Sec. 382. Whenever a case is finally submitted to the
jury, they may decide in Court, or retire for deliberation.
If they retire, they must be kept together in some conve
nient place, under the charge of a sworn officer, until they
agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by the Court, sub
ject to the discretion of the Court, to permit them to sepa
rate temporarily and at their meals. The officer having
them under his charge shall not suffer any communication
to be made to them, or make any himself, except to ask
them if they have agreed upon their verdict, unless by or
der of the Court ; and he shall not, before the verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of their de
liberations or the verdict agreed upon. (329.)
Sec. 383. If the jury are permitted to separate, either
during the trial or after the cause is submitted to them,
they must be admonished by the Court that it is their duty
not to converse with each other, or suffer themselves to be
addressed by any other person, on any subject of the trial ;
and during the trial, that it is their duty not to form or ex
press among themselves, an opinion thereon, until the cause
is finally submitted to them. (330.)
Sec. 384. After the jury have retired for deliberation,
if there is a disagreement between them as to any part of
the testimony, or if they desire to be informed as to any
point of law arising in the case, they may request the offi
cer to conduct them into Court, where the information re
quired shall be given in the presence of, or after notice to,
the parties or their attorneys. (331.)
Sec. 385. The jury may be ' discharged by the Court,
on account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or
calamity requiring the discharge, or by consent of both
parties, or after they have been kept together until it satis
factorily appears that there is no probability of their agree
ing. (332.)
Sec. 386. In all cases where the jury are discharged
during the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, it
may be tried again immediately, or at a future time, as the
Court may direct. (333.)
Sec. 387. When the jury have agreed upon their verdiet,
it must be reduced to writing and signed by the fore-
man; and when returned into court, the foreman shall de
liver the verdict, and either party may poll the jury. If
any juror dissent from the verdict, they shall again be sent
out to deliberate. (334.)
[ Verdicts ]
Sec. 388. The verdict of a jury is either a general or
special. A general verdict is that by which they pronounce
generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of
the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by
which the jury find the facts only, leaving judgment thereon
to the Court. (335.)
Sec. 389. In all actions the jury, unless otherwise di-
rected by the Court, may, in their discretion, render a general
or special verdict ; but the Court shall, at the request
of either party, direct them to give a special verdict in
writing upon all or any of the issues ; and in all cases,
when requested by either party, shall instruct them, if they
render a general verdict, to find specially upon particular
questions of fact to be stated in writing. This special find
ing is to be recorded with the verdict. (336.)
Sec. 390. When the special finding of facts is inconsist
ent with the general verdict, the former shall control the
latter, and the Court shall give judgment accordingly. (337.)

Sec. 392. In actions for the recovery of specific per
sonal property, the jury must assess the value of the prop
erty, as also the damages for the taking or detention, when
ever, by their verdict, there will be a judgment for the re
covery or return of the property. (339.)
[Trial by the Court.']
Sec. 393. The trial, by jury, may be waived by the
parties, in all actions, in the following manner:
First. By failing to appear at the trial.
Second. By a written consent in person, or by attorney,
filed with the Clerk.
Third. By oral consent in open Court, entered on the
record. (340.)
Sec. 394. Upon trials of questions of fact by the
Court, it shall not be necessary for the Court to state its
finding, except generally, for the plaintiff or defendant, un
less one of the parties request it, with a view of excepting
to the decision of the Court upon the questions of law in
volved in the trial, in which case, the Court shall first
state the facts in writing, and then the conclusions of law
upon them, and judgment shall be entered accordingly.
And, whenever any issue of law or fact is submitted to the
Court for trial, and the Judge shall take the same under
advisement, the Judge shall not, except in case of severe
illness of himself or family, hold the same under advise
ment for more than sixty days, and, if the Court wherein
said issues arose, be not then in session, he shall file his de
termination therein, in writing, with the papers in the case.
(341.)
Sec. 395. When any Superior Court consists of more
than one Judge, there shall be held general and special terms
thereof. A general term of such Court may be held by a
majority of the Judges, and a special term by any one or
more of them ; and general and special terms, or one or
more of them, may be held at the same time, as the Judges ot
the Court may direct ; and whenever such term or terms are
held, they shall be taken and deemed to have been held by
the authority and direction of the judges.
Sec. 396. The said Court, at general or special term,
shall have power to issue and direct all process to Courts 0f'
inferior jurisdiction, and to corporations and individuals,
which shall be necessary in exercising its jurisdiction, and
for the regular execution of the law, and to make all proper
judgments, sentences, decrees, orders and injunctions, and
to issue all process and executions, and to do such other acts
as may be necessary to carry into effect the same, in con
formity with the constitution and laws of the State. The
Court shall, at such times as the business of the Court may
require it, meet in general term, and may, at any time, make
such distribution and and re-distribution of the business of
the Court to special term, as it may deem proper. Each
Judge, holding Court at special term, shall transact the
business assigned him ; but he may, in his discretion, call
one or more of the Judges of said Court to sit with him in
such special term, for the consideration of any matter pend
ing before him. Said Court, at special term, shall have full
power to hear and dispose of business distributed to it by
the general term ; and it shall, at either special or general
term, have the same power, to vacate or modify its own
judgments or orders, rendered at either special or general
term, and to enter judgments by confession, as is, or may be,
vested by law in Circuit Courts.
Sec. 397. The Judges of said Court, or either of them,

missioners to convey real property, and to grant commis
sions for the examination of witnesses, and to appoint other
officers necessary to facilitate and transact the business of
said Court, as is now, or may hereafter be, conferred on
Judges of Circuit Courts.
Sec. 398. When any reason for a change of venue is
shown to exist from any of the Judges, as in other cases,
the remaining Judge or Judges alone shall act, but when
all are incompetent to act, the case shall be transferred to
the Circuit Court of the county.
Sec. 399. In all cases where, under existing or future
laws of this State, a person has the right of appeal from the
Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, an appeal may be had
from a special term to the general term of said Superior
Court. The appeal shall be heard and considered in the
general term upon the original papers and records filed
and made in the cause at special term, and such matters as
are made part thereof by bills of exceptions ; it may affirm
or reverse the judgment of the special term or modify it,
or render such judgment as may be deemed proper. It
shall, if the judgment of the special term is not affirmed,
enter of record the error or errors found therein, and re
mand said cause to the special term with instructions as to
said error or errors, and the special term shall carry into
effect the instructions of the general term.
Sec- 400- It; sna^ only t>e necessary for a party appeal-
ing from a special to the general term to pray an appeal to
the general term, and it shall be granted as a matter of
right, and no bond shall be required in such case, unless it
is shown by affidavit to be necessary for the protection of
the rights of parties, in which case bonds shall be given,
with such conditions as may be directed by the Court ; and
such appeal shall stay the proceedings upon the action of
the special term in the case, and in the manner that a stay
of proceedings is allowed upon an appeal to the Supreme
Court from the Circuit Court, and none other.
Sec. 401. Any party may appeal to the Supreme Court
r .v i â¢ j i > ix â¢
trom the order or judgment of general term in any case
where, by existing or future laws of this State, an appeal
may be had from an order or judgment of the Circuit Court,
and also when a party has had a judgment in his favor in a
special term, and it is reversed or modified by the general
term upon appeal to it, the appeal from the general term to
the Supreme Court shall be regulated by the law regulating
appeals from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court so far
as applicable. An appeal may also be taken to the Su
preme Court in the same manner and in like cases as from
Circuit Courts, or the Judge thereof, when, on account of
the incompetency of some of the Judges, an appeal can not
be taken to general term.
[Exceptions.]
Sec. 402. An exception is an objection taken to a de-
cision of the Court upon a matter of law. (342.)
Sec. 403. The party objecting to the decision must ex-

reduce such exception to writing. (343.)
