or written agreement, upon which such action was originally
brou ht, and the performance of which was secured by such
pena sum.§

SECT. 150. Whenever such further breaches shall occur, the
plaintiff, or his personal representatives, or any person entitled
to an action on such bond, for his use, may have a scire facias
upon such judgment, suggesting further breaches against the

any court, may file in vacation, or at any time before trial, a

hereinafter prescribed.

taken: 01‘ unlawfully detained from the owner, or the person}

entitled to the possession thereof, or when any personal goods
taken on execution or attachment, are claimed by any person,
other than the defendant in the suit in which they are thus
taken, such owner, or person entitled to the possession thereof,
or such claimant may cause any such personal goods to be
replevied by a writ to be sued out and prosecuted for that purpose. "‘
Saar. 160. No replevin shall lie for any personal goods and

chattels taken by virtue of any warrant or precept for the collection of any tax or assessment in pursuance of any statute of
this state, by the person for whose tax or assessment such goods

Sncr. 161. N o replevin shall lie at the suit of any defendant

in any execution or attachment, to recover any personal goods
and chattels, taken by virtue of such execution or attachment,
unless such goods and chattels are exempted by law from execution or attachment.

Saar. 162. Whenever executors or administrators, suing in
the right of another, are authorized to maintain actions of trover, trespass, or trespass on the case, for any personal property
wrongfu ly taken, or unlawfully detained, such executors or administrrators may maintain actions of replevin for such propert . .

Siiicr. 163. Whenever an action of replevin shall be brought
for the recovery of goods and chattels, it may be brought in
any county in which such goods and chattels shall be unlawfully
detained, except in cases of distress for rent, in which case the
action shall be laid in the county Where the distress was made.

Sncr. 164. Before any person shall be entitled to sue out a
writ in such action, an afiidavit must be made and filed in the
proper clerk’s office, by the plaintiff, or some one in his behalf,
and sworn to before such clerk, or some person authorized to
administer such oath. i

Smcr. 165. Such afiidavit must allege that the plaintiff in
such action is, '

1. The owner of the property described in such aiiidavit, or
or that he is then lawfully entitled to the possession thereof.I

2. That the same has not been taken as his property for any .
tax or assessment against him, levied by any law of this state, ‘

nor seized under any execution or attachment against his goods
and chattels liable to execution.

3. That the goods and chattels sought to be replevied have
been wrongfully taken and are unlawfully detained by the defendant, or are unlawfull detained, as the case may be. ,

4. Such affidavit shall specify the name or names of the
plaintiff or plaintiffs, and the defendant or defendants; and also
the property sought to be replevied, and the reasonable value
thereof, and in what county the same is then believed to be detained.

SECT. 166. When such affidavit is made and filed as aforesaid with the clerk of the circuit court having jurisdiction, such
clerk shall issue a writ of replevin, directed to the proper odicer, which shall be substantially in the following form:

“The state of Indiana to the of county, greeting:
Whereas, A— B— has filed. in the clerk’s office of the circuit
court for the county aforesaid, an affidavit, alleging that C—
D— has wrongfully taken and does unlawfully detain, (or “does
unlawfully detain,” as the case may be,) one horse, cow, (or
whatever the article or articles of property may be, particularly
describing the same, to be replevied,) of the alleged value of
—- dollars. You are therefore hereby commanded to replevy
the said goods and chattels, by taking them into your custody,
and deliver the same to the said A— B—, if he will satisfy
you by giving bond with sufficient sureties, as required by law,
to duly prosecute his said action of replevin, with effect and
without delay, and to return the aforesaid goods and chattels
thus replevied, if return thereof shall be adjudged, and to pay
all such sums of money as may be recovered against him hereupon; and also, in case you replevy said goods and chattels, or
any part thereof, that you summon the said C D to
appear before the judges of the circuit court of county
aforesaid, on the (naming the proper return day of writs in personal actions,) to answer the said A— B— in the premises-”*

SECT. 167. Upon the receipt of the writ the sheriff shall
forthwith proceed to execute the same by -taking possession of
the property specified therein, or so much thereof as he can
find, and delivering the possession of the same to said plaintiff
or his agent, and by summoning the defendant according to the
tenor of the writ.

Seer. 168. But before the sheriff or officer executing such
writ shall deliver the property so replevied to the plaintiff, he
shall take from such plaintiff, or some person on his behalf, a
bond payable to the defendant, with sufiicient surety, in the

 
 

penalty of double the value of such property, with condition
that the plaintiff will duly prosecute his said suit with effect
and without delay, and that he will return said property to the
defendant if such return be adjudged by the court, and will
pay to the defendant all such sums of money as may be recovered against him by such defendant in said action for any
cause whatever. *

‘Sac-r. 169. The officer taking such bond shall deliver the
same to said defendant whenever requested; and for any
breach of the condition thereof, said defendant may bring an
action against the obligors therein named, and shall recover
such sum as shall be just and equitable.

Sncr. 170._ If, after such oflicer shall have replevied said
goods and chattels, the plaintiff shall fail for twenty-four hours
next after such replevin, to give bond to the acceptance of the
sheriff as aforesaid, such ofiicer shall immediately thereafter return said goods and chattels to such defendant, or the person
from whose custody the same were taken, and take his receipt
therefor. ' _

Sncr. 171. "Any costs necessarily occasioned by the keeping
of any property from the time the same was thus re levied
until such bond is given, or in case of failure to give suc bond
then until such property is returned to the person entitled
thereto, shall be paid by the plaintiff to such sheriff; and such

costs, in case of dispute, shall be such sum as the court shall

deem reasonable. r .

Snow. 172. If the aflidavit of the plaintiff is defective, l'IIS
suit shall not be dismissed therefor, if he shall, within such time
as the court shall prescribe, file an additional or supplemental
aflidavit, by which the defects in the original affidavit shall be
cured; nor shall such suit be dismissed on account of any
defect in his bond, if, within the time prescribed by theicourta
he shall file a suflicient bond.

Sncr. 173. Such affidavit and bond, when filed, shall be t0
all intents and purposes, of the same force and effect as if they
had been filed at the commencement of the action. _

Sncr. 174. The plaintiff in his declaration may insert different counts for an unlawful taking and detention, and for an
unlawful detention, although the afbdavit and writ may allege
only an unlawful detention, or only an unlawful taking and detention. A l

Seer. 175. The plaintiff shall declare against the defendant
within the same time as in other ersonal actions, and in case
he shall neglect so to do, he shall e liable to the like judgment
of a non-suit or discontinuance as in such actions; and upon
filing a declaration, the same, as to the pleadings and trial, shall
proceed as in other cases. "

Snc-r. 176. It shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to state
in his declaration any other place than the county where such
goods and chattels are alleged to have been taken or to be detained; except where the action shall be brought for the recovery of goods or chattels distrained.

S1-zcr. 177. When the unlawful taking of the property described in the declaration is complained of therein, the plea of
the general issue shall be, as heretofore, that the defendant did not take the goods and chattels described in the
declaration, or any of them, in manner and form as the plaintiff
has alleged; and such plea shall put in issue, not only-the taking
of such goods and chattels, but also such taking in the place
stated where the place is material. T

Seer. 178. When the action is founded on the wrongful
detention of the goods and chattels, and the original taking is
not complained of, the plea of the general issue shall be, that the
defendant does not detain the goods and chattels specified in
the declaration nor any part thereof, in manner and form as
therein alle ed, and such plea shall put in issue, not only the
detention 0% such goods and chattels, but also the property of
the plaintiff therein.1 ,

Seer. 179. In replevin in case of distress for rent, the defendants may avow or make cognizance generally, that the
plaintiff in replevin, or other tenant of the lands or tenements,

vvhereon such distress was made, enjoyed the same under a

grant or demise, or by any other title, at a certain rent or service during the time wherein the rent or service distrained for
was incurred, which rent or service was then and still remains
due; or that the place where the distress was made was parcel
of certain tenements for which the rent or service distrained

for, was, at the time of such distress, and still remains due,
without further setting forth the grant, tenure, demise, or title
of such landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors. "

_ SECT. 180. The plaintiff may plead in answer to any avowry or cognizance, as many several matters as he shall think
necessary for his defence. Saar. 181. elf, upon the trial of the cause, the verdict be in
favor of the plaintiff, the same jury shall assess the damages
which he has sustained by the unlawful taking or detention of
the property so replevied; and if judgment pass for the plaintiff
by default or upon an issue of law, the damages shall be assessed by a jury upon a writ of inquiry.‘

Snow. 18?. If it appear, upon a non-suit of the plaintiff, or
after a trial or otherwise,.that the defendant is entitled to a
return of the goods, he shall have judgment and execution
therefor, accordingly, with damages for the detention thereof,
which may be assessed by a writ of inquiry.T

Sncr. 183. The defendant, except in cases where the property replevied has been distrained, whenever he shall be entitled to a return of the property replevied, or to any part thereof,
may take judgment against the plaintiff for the value of the defendant’s interest in such property, with hisidamages for the detention thereof; in which case such value may be assessed as damages on the trial, or by atwrit of inquiry, as the case shall
require, upon which judgment he may have execution as in
other cases. ,

Sncr. 184. If ’the property replevied. shall have been distrained for rent, the defendant, whenever entitled to a return,
may proceed as follows :

1. If the defendant shall not have made an avowry or cognizance, and therein set forth the arrears of rent, he may make a subgestion on the record in the nature of an avowry or cognizance,
for the rent in arrear, and a writ of inquiry shall be awarded
to ascertain by a jury the sum in a-rrear at the time of such
distress taken, and also the value of the ‘property distrained;
and upon such inquisition the defendant shall have judgment to
recover against the plaintiff the value of the property thus distrained, not to exceed such arrearages of rent,.for which he
shall have execution as in other cases?‘

2'. If judgment shall have been given for the defendant upon
demurrer, he may make. the like suggestion of the arrears of.
rent, as above provided, if the same shall not have been already
pleaded by him, and the court shall award a like writ of inquiry,
upon which thesame proceedings shall be had, and like judgment and execution as above provided.

3. If in any of the cases specified in the preceding clauses
of this section, the defendant shall have made an avowry or
cognizance, and before the trial he shall, by the non-suit of the
plaintiff, or otherwise, be entitled to have a return of the property adjudged to him, he may have a writ of inquiry awarded
as before provided in this section, upon which the same proceedings shall be had and like judgment and execution as above
provided.

4. If the plaintiff shall suifer a non-suit after proceeding to
trial, or if the jury shall find against such plaintiff, then the
jurors that are empannelled totry such issue, shall at the prayer
of the defendant, enquire concerning the amount of rent in arrear, and the value of the property distrained; and thereupon
the defendant-shall have judgment and execution as above provided in this section. '

5. If the value of the property distrained shall not be found
to be equal to the arrears of rent distrained for, the party to
Whom such arrears were due, his executors, administrators, or
assigns may distrain again for the residue of such arrears.‘

Saar. 185. Notwithstanding the defendant may have elected
to proceed under the last two sections, he shall not be precluded
from resortin to his remedy on the plaintiff’s bond, to him taken
by the sheri .T '

.Sucr. 186.. In such case thetamountirecovered in such action of replevin, as the value of the property replevied, with
interest thereon from the date of the judgment in replevin, shall
be the measure of damages, to be added to the other damages
which may be recovered in the suit on such bond.

S1:c'r. 187. The measure of damages on the breaches assigned in any action on a replevin bond shall be the value of
the property adjudged to be returned, and “the damages and
costs recovered in the action of replevin, remaining unpaid, subject to the provisions contained‘ in the next following section.

S1-:c'r. 188. Whenever suit is brought on any such bond, and
also in any case where the defendant .in the action of replevin
shall elect to inquire by a jury the value of the property replevied, with a view to take judgment therefor, if by reason of
any special property, which the defendant in the action of replevin had in such property, or otherwise, he ought not, in strict

justice, to recover in such action of replevin, nor in the suit on

such bond the value of such property such damages may be
assessed iii lieu of such value, as shall heive been really sustained.

Sncr. 203. Whenever any action on such bond or instru'ment specified in the last preceding section shall be pending,

the defendant may, at any time before judgment rendered
therein, pay to the plaintiff, or bring into court for the plaintiff’s
use, the principal sum, and interest due by the condition of such
bond or instrument, together with the costs incurred in said action, and thereupon such action shall be discontinued; or the
defendant may bring into court such principal sum and interest,
and judgment shall be given against him for the costs only.

Sncr. 204. When there are mutual debts or demands between the plaintiff and defendant in any action, one demand
may be set off against the other, as provided in this section,
that is to say,

1. It must be a demand arising upon judgment, or upon a
contract, express or implied, whether such contract be written
or unwritten, sealed or without a seal; and if it be founded upon
a bond, or other contract having a penalty, the sum equitably
due by virtue of the condition only shall be set off; but it must
be a demand for real or personal property sold, or for money
paid, or for money had and received, or for services done, or it
must be for a sum that is liquidated, or one that can be ascertained by calculation.

2. It must be due to the defendant in his own right, either as
the ori inal creditor or payee, or as being the assignee or owner
thereo . T

3. It must have existed at the time of the commencement of
of the suit, and must then have belonged to the defendant.

4. The set-off shall be allowed in all actions founded on demands which could themselves be the subject of set-off, according to law, and no others.

5. If there be several plaintiffs, the demand set off must be
due from them all jointly; if there are several defendants, it
must be due to them all jointly, except when the person with
whom a contract is made has a dormant partner, and a suit is
brought on such contract, by or against the partners jointly,
any demand due to or from the person with whom the contract
was made, may be set off in like manner as if such dormant
partner had not been joined in the suit.1

6. If the contract on which the suit is brou ht has been assigned to the plaintiff, he may set off any emand existing A
against such laintiff, or any assignee of such contract, before :
notice of sucll assignment, if the demand be such as might have
been set off against such plaintiff, or any such assignee, while
the contract belonged to him. *

7. If the action is brought by one person in trust, or for the
use of another, the defendant may set off any demand against
the person for whose use or benefit the action is brought, in like
manner as if that person were the laintiH'.

8. But in the case of an action y the trustees of an insolvent, demands shall be allowed to be set off, only as specified in
the provisions of the Revised Statutes respecting insolvent
debtors.

9. In actions by executors and administrators, demands
against their testators and intestates, which belonged to the defendant at the time of their death, may be set off in the same
manner as if the action had been brought by the deceased.

10. In actions against executors and administrators, and
trustees, and others in their representative character, the defendant may set off demands which belonged to their testator or
intestate, or those whom they represent, in the same manner as
the person represented would have been entitled to set off the

_same in an action against himself.

11. In actions brought by or against executors, administrators, trustees, or others in their representative character, no demand shall be set off that is due to or from such executors,
administrators, or trustees, or others in their own right.

Sacr. 205. To entitle the defendant to a set-off, he must
plead, or give notice of such set-off.

Sncr. 206. Such notice must be given, together with the
plea of the general issue, in those actions in which such issue
may he pleaded; and in those actions in which it cannot be
pleaded, the defendant may plead payment, and give notice of
the set-off, with such plea; and the filing of any such notice
With the plea, shall be a sufiicient notification thereof to the adverse party.

SECT. 207. The statement containing any notice of set-off,
shall be as certain in substance as would be required in a declaration, and the court may allow amendments of such notice, as
in like cases of pleas.

Sncr. 208. When issue is joined on the plea of set-off, or
other proper plea with notice of the set-off, the plaintiff shall
be entitled to every ground of defence against such set-off, of
which he might have availed himself under the general issue, or
by any form of pleading in an action brought against him on
the demand thus alleged as a set-off.

Sncr. 209. When the sum of the matters of set-off alleged
exceed the amount of the plaintiff’s demand, the provisions of
law limiting personal actions, if applicable to the set-off, may be

replied, so as to prevent a recovery by the defendant of such

excess.
Sncr. ~210. If the set-off established is less than the" plaintifi"’s debt or demand, he shall have judgment for the residue
only; if such set-off be equal to the plaintiff’s debt or demand,

the defendant shall have jud ment for his costs.
Sncr. 211. If there be ound a balance due from the plaintilf, judgment shall be rendered for the defendant for the amount
of such balance; but no such judgment shall be rendered when
the contract or demand which is the subject of the action shall
have been assigned before the commencement of the suit, for any
balance due from any other person than the plaintiff in the actlon.
Snow. 212. When, upon any set off against an executor or
administrator, a balance shall be found due to the defendant, the
’ judgment therefor shall be in the same form, and have the same
effect, as if the suit had been originally commenced by the defendant, except as stated in the following section.
Saar. 213. If at the time of the trial of such action, the

executor or administrator shall have instituted proceedings to
settle the estate of the deceased as insolvent, judgment shall be
rendered for the defendant for such balance, but no execution
shall issue therefor, and the court shall order it to be certilied
by the clerk to the proper probate court, that it may be laid before such court and settled as other judgments of creditors
against the estate of the deceased. ‘

Sncr. 214. In any action founded upon any specialty, or
other contract, conveyances of real estate, and instruments negotiable by the law merchant excepted, the defendant, by special
plea, may allege the Want or failure of the consideration, or any
part thereof; and if any specialty, or other contract, excepting
as aforesaid, is alleged in any plea, replication, or other pleadings,
by any of the arties, the other. party may in like manner allege
the want or failure of the consideration, or any part thereof.*

8

Saar. 215. , Whenever in any action, any such specialty, or
other contract, shall be given in evidence without being specially
pleaded, the other party may, excepting as aforesaid, prove the
want or failure in whole or in part of the consideration thereof.

Smcr. 216. The plea of non est factum, non-assignment, or
any other plea, replication, or other pleading, denying, or requiring
proof of the execution or assignment of any bond, bill, release,
or other instrument in writing, which is the foundation of any
suit or defence, and which is specially set forth as such in the
declaration, plea, or other pleadings, shall not impose the necessity of such proof, unless verified by oath or aHirmation.*‘

_ Snow. 2217. When any such plea, or other pleading specified
in the preceding section, denies or requires proof of any assignment, the oath or affirmation shall be, that the party has reason

‘to believe, and does verily believe, that such assignment was not

made before the suit was commenced.

SE01‘. 218. Whenever any bill of exchange, note, obligation,
or other contract in writing, shall be declared upon, pleaded, or
replied in any action as payable to. the party declaring upon,
pleading, or replying the same, or to any other person, proof of
the names of the makers, assignors, obligors, assignees, payees,
or obligees of any such bill, note, obligation, or contract, shall
not be necessary, unless the same shall be put in issue by some
form of pleading verified by affidavit.

Sncr. 219. In any action or defence founded on. any bill of

exchange, note, obligation, or other contract for the payment of t

money, to be paid at a particular place, it shall not be necessary

to aver in the pleadings, nor to rove on the trial, a demand of

payment at such place ; but in al such cases, the opposite party
‘ rial his readiness to

under the proper issue may show on the t '

pay such debt or demand at the place specified in the bill, note,

obligation, or other contract.
Siicr. 220. When such read

prior to the commencement of the action. _

without reciting any matter contained in such statute.

his bill within such time as the court shall allow, upon the payment of costs, as the court in its discretion may direct.

Snow. 25. After the cause is ordered to be set down for
hearing, and before the hearing thereof, the complainant may be
permitted by the court to amend his bill; but he shal not in
such case obtain leave to amend, except upon a special 0 der of
the court, on petition alleging the s ecial matter of amendment
intended to be made, and supporte by afiidavit that the matter
of the pro osed amendment is material, and could not with reasonable di igence have been sooner introduced into the bill, and
that such application is not made for vexation or delay.

Sncr. 26. If the complainant obtaining any order to amend

every case in which the bill specially charges fraud or combination, a plea to such part must be accompanied with an answer fortifying the plea, and explicitly denying the fraud and
combination, and the facts on which the charge is founded.

Seer. 34. No demurrer or» plea shall be held bad, and overruled upon argument, only because such demurrer or plea shall
not cover so much of the bill as it might by law have extended to.
Snow. 35. No demurrer or plea shall be held bad and overruled upon argument, only because the answer ‘of the defendant
may extend to some part of the same matter which may be

covered by such demurrer or plea. _

shall answer fully to all the matters of the bill, shall no longer
apply in cases where he might by plea protect himself from such
» answer and discovery; and he shall be entitled in all cases by
answer" to insist upon all matters of defence, (not being matters
of abatement, or to the character of the parties, or matters Of
L form,) in bar of or to the merits of -the bill, of which he may be
entitled to avail himself by a plea in bar.

SE01‘. 37. In such answer, he shall not be compellable to answer any other matters than he would be compellable to answer
and discover upon filing a plea in bar, and an answer _in support
of such plea, touching the matters set forth in the bill to avoid

or repel the bar or defence.
Seer. 38. ‘ A defendant shall be at liberty by answer to de:°_ cline answering any interrogatory, or part of an interrogatoryo

from answering which he might have protected himself by flemurrer; and he shall be at liberty so to decline, notwithstanding
he shall answer other arts of the bill, from which he might
have protected himself y demurrer.

.. Sacr. 39. Where the defendant shall by his answer suggest

3 that the bill is defective for want of parties, the complainant

objection only, and the purpose for which the same is so set
down shall be entered in the clerk’s order book, in the f0I'm_ 01'
to the effect following: “ set down upon the defendant’s Oblec‘

tion for want of parties.”

cause, but shall proceed therewith to a hearing, notwithstanding

saving the rights of the absent parties.
Snow. 42. After an answer is put in, it may be amended as

of course, in any matter of form, or by filling up a blank, or
correcting a date or reference to a document, or other small
matter, and be resworn at any time before a replication is put
in, or the cause is set down for a hearing upon bill and answer.

Snow. 43. After replication or such setting down for a
hearing, the answer shall not be amended in any material matters,
or by adding new facts or references, or by qualifying or altering
the original statements, except by special leave of the court
upon motion and cause shown, supported, if required, by afIidavit; and in every case where leave is so granted, the court
may, in their discretion, require that such amendment be separately engrossed and added as a distinct amendment to the
original answer so as to be distinguishable therefrom.

circumstances. " _

have a seal, his official attestation with the seal of his office
afiixed, or if he shall not have such a sea], then his ofiicial certificate, with the certificate of the prothonotary or clerk of some

‘ complainant shall not proceed on the answer till the demurrer
shall ‘have been argued or disposed of.
Sacr. 48. If a plea or demurrer be overruled, no other plea
‘or demurrer shall be thereafter received without leave of the
court; and in case a plea be overruled, the bill may be
taken as confessed, and if so done the court shall proceed to

deemed reasonable.
Saar. 53. If, at the hearing, the exceptions shall be allowed

as of course be entitled to take the bill, so far as the matter of
such exceptions is concerned, as confessed; or, at his election,
he may have a writ of attachment to compel the defendant to
make a better answer to the matter of the exceptional
