to convey or give an estate in lands, unless written in the tes
tat0r’s lifetime, _and signed by him, or by some other person
in his presence and by his direction, and subscribed in his pres
sence by two witnesses at least, neither of whom is interested
in the devise of the said lands.
[Act 1784, 1st Sess., ch. 22, § 11.
A will may beinelfectual to pass lands and yet effectual as to the disposition of
personalty. Guthrie v. Owen, 2 Humph. 202. W'e have no statute on the sub
ject of wills of personal ty. See the following cases: McLean v. McLean, 6 Humph.

§ 452 ; Moore v. Steele, 10 Humph. 562 ; Suggett v. Kitchell, 6 Yerg. 425 ; Williams

v. Saunders, 5 Cold. 60; Green v. 1IcCrackin Peck, 301.

Where the will was

writtcn on separate pieces of paper, and the last piece only signed by the attest
ing witnesses, it is necessary that all the pieces should have bccn produced at the
time the witnesses signed; but this fact may be provcn by circumstances. Gass
v. Gass, 3 Humph. 278, 285. The witnesses must sign in the presence of the tes
taior and at his request, but it is not necessary that they should sign in the pres
ence of each other. Logue v. Stanton, 5 Sneed, 97. Although a will of lands with
only one subscribing witness is not good; yet if there be n. subsequent codicil
attested by two witnesses, it cures the original will. Stover v. Kendall, 5 Cold.
§ 557. The codicil amounts to a republication. Ib.; Gass v. Gass, 3 Humph. 278,

§ 286.—“ Neither of whom is interetted.”—This means, interested in the devise ofthe
lands in the will. An attesting witness who is a lcgatce of personalty, is not
thereby rendered incompetent. Walker v. Skeene, 3 Head, 1, 4. Nor is an heir
of the tcstator, who takes nothing under the will; for he is interested against the
will. Allcn v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 172. Whether a. devisee of land under the will,
equally interested for or against the will, would be a competent attesting witness,
reserved. Ib. If the witness was competent at the time of the attestation, subse
quent events rendering him incompetent, cannot destroy the validity of the will.
Ib., 5. And see,construing this clause of this statute, the following North Carolina
cases:Winant v. Winant, 1 Murph. 148; Tucker v. Tucker, 5 Ired. 161; Alli
son v. Allison, 1 Hawks, 141; Daniel v. Proctor, 1 Dev. 428; Old v. Old, 4
Dev. 500; Mathews v. Marchant, 8 Dev. &. Batt. 40.
It is sullicicnt if the will be read to the testator and he knew its contents and
signed it and the witnesses attested it in his presence and at his request, and
these facts may be proven by persons other than subscribing witnesses. Rose v.
Allen, 1 Cold. 23. A marksman may bea good subscribing witness. Ford v.

Ford, 7 Humph. 92, 96 ; 1 Cold. 25. Or the signature of a subscribing witness is
good even though written by another. 7 Humph. 97.
Written by
teltator.

§ 2163. But a paper writing, appearing to be the will of a.
deceased person, written by him, having his name subscribed
to it, or inserted in some part of it, and found, after his death,
among his valuable papers, or lodged in the hands of another
for safe keeping, shall be good and suﬁicient to give and con
vey lands, if the handwriting is generally known by his ac
quaintances, and it is proved, by at least three credible wit
nesses, that they verily believe the writing and every part of
it to be in his hand.

[Act 1784, 2d Scss., ch. 10, § 5.]

This Statute discussed and expounded at length in Crutchcr v. Crntcher, ll
Humph. 877. It makes a special exception to the mode of authentication pre
scribed by the Act of April, 1784, ch. 22, Q 11, ( Q 2162,) which being complied
with, is equivalent to express publication. lb ; Marr v. Mari‘, 2 Head, 303, 807 ;
Hooper v. McQuary, 5Cold. 129. All the requisites of the statute must concur.
Ib. The paper must be entirely in the hand-writing of the testator, and his name
subscribed thereto, or inserted in some part of it. Tate v. Tate, 11 Hurnph. 465.
The hand-writing must be generally known by the acquaintances of the deceased,

and bo proved by at least three credible witnesses to be that of the tcstator.
That is, the hand-writing must be so wcll known, as that, if a false will be pro
pounded for probate, it will be in the power of the persons interested in the estate
to expose and defeat it by proof oi‘ other witnesses. Ib., 466. The intention of

the statute is that it appear that the existence or place of deposit of the paper propounded as a will was known to the maker, and that he had its preservation in view as his will.

Ib.

It must have been deposited among his valuable papers or in the hands of
another for safe keeping; and valuable papers within the meaning of the statute
are such as the deceased regarded as worthy of preservation, and therefore in his

estimation of some value. It is not conﬁned to deeds for land, obligations for
money or certiﬁcates of stock. Any others which are kept and considered worthy
of being taken care of by the particular person must be regarded as embraced in
that description. This requirement is only intended as an indication on the part
of the writer that it is his intention to preserve and perpetuate the paper in ques
tion as a disposition of his property; that he regards it as valuable. Marr v.
Man‘, 2 Head, 303, 306; Hooper v. McQuary, 5 Cold. 136. Whether the papers
among which the paper propounded is found are valuable papers, is a question to
be left entirely to the jury. Marr v. ltiarr, 5 Sneed, 385.
It must also appear that the party intended the paper to be his will. 2 Head,
§ 307. How far this intention is to be gathered from the formalities of the paper.
§ 2 Head, 307. The intention of the statute seems to be that the mere absence of
the signature will not vitiate the paper as a will, if the name of tho deceased

appropriately and signiﬁcantly appear in some part of it.

§ 5 Sneed, 884.

Where the testator ordered the will to be placed in the drawer of a bureau in
which his wife kept her trinkets, jewels, money and clothes under lock and in her

own charge, this was held to satisfy the statute.
§ 385.

Harrison v. Burgess. 1 Hawks,

Awill executed and deposited in conformity with the statute cannot be revoked
by a. mere verbal declaration. There must be some act done indicative of a
change of purpose such as the cancellation, destruction or removal from the place
of deposit, or reclamation from the hands of the person with whom it may have
been lodged. Marr v. M-arr, 2 Head, 303, 307. See Q 2167 and note. The ver
bal declarations of the testator are admissible for the purpose of showing whether
he intended the paper to operate as a will ; but when such declarations are estab
lished by proof, they cannot have the effect of defeating the testamentary char
acter of the paper, or of working a revocation ofit as a will. I‘o., 310-ll. And
see Crutcher v. Crutchcr, ll Hurnph. 377, 380
Presumption against the validity of an unﬁnished paper as a will. ll Humph.
§ 384—5. The construction of a paper as to its testamentary character and the for
mality of its execution is a question of law for the court. Ib. 385-6.
\Vhere the paper propounded was found in a package of papers marked “ not
valuable ” it was held that the endorsement “not valuable ” might be proved by
oral testimony. 5 Sneed, 389-90.

§ 2164. Every devise shall convey the entire estate of the gfgliasteron of
testator in the lands, unless the contrary intent plainly appear
I
from the words and context of the will.
[Act 178-L, 1st Sess., ch. 22, § 11, modiﬁed]
§ 2165. No nucupative will shall be good, where the estate N,,,,,,,,,,,,,e
exceeds two hundred and ﬁfty dollars, unless proved by two §iiiié.'°°‘“1'
disinterested witnesses present at the making thereof; and un
less they, or some of them, were especially required to bear
witness thereto, by the testator himself; and unless it was made
in his last sickness, in his own habitation or dwelling-house, or where he had been previously residing ten days at least, except
he be surprised by sickness on a journey or from home, and
dies without returning to his dwelling. [Ib.,§ 15.]
Both witnesses must be present at the some time and hear the same declara
tion. If each of the witnesses heard a different declaration made at a different
time, but both of similar import, this is not sufficient. Tally v. Butterworth, 10

Yerg. 501.—“ specially required to bear witness,” etc.

It is not necessary that the

testator should especially require the witnesses to bear witness of the disposition
he is about to make of his effects in the formal words of the statute. Where
the testator said, addressing himself to the witnesses, “ I wish to make a disposition

of my effects ” and then proceeded to make thefactum of the disposition, this was
held sufﬁcient.

Baker v. Dodson, 4 Humph. 842.

It is suflicient if the testator

by intelligent language or acts, invites the attention of the witnesses, to the fact
that he is making a will.

Hatcher v. Millard, 2 Cold. 80.

It is not sufficient that

the deceased in making a disposition of her effects merely desigrird that the wit
nesses present should bear it in mind as her will, and that the witnesses did so
bear it in mind. Ridley v. Coleman, 1 Snced, 6, 16. Where the testator a few

hours before his death was asked if he wished to make any disposition of his prop
erty, and immediately in answer thereto requested the witness to inform his friends
what disposition he wished to make, this was held sufficient. Gwin v. Wright, 8
Humph. 639.
Proof of.

§ 2166. N0 nuucupative will shall be proved by the witnesses

after six months from the making, unless it were put in writing
within ten days; nor shall it be proved till fourteen days after
the death of the testator; nor till process has issued to call in

the widow or next of kin, or both, if conveniently to be found,
to contest it.

[Ib., § 16.]

The requisites of a valid nuncupative will are formally stated in Gwin v. Wright,

sequent nuncupative will, except the same be in the lifetime of
the testator reduced to writing and read over to him and ap
proved; and unless the same be proved to have been so done
by the oaths of two witnesses at least, who shall be such as are_
admissible upon trials at common law. [Ib., § 14.]
This Act npplies only to wills of personalty. Allen v. Huff‘, l Yerg. 404, 407 ;
Greer v. LicC-rackin Peck, 301, 306; Clark v. Eborn, 1 N. C. Law R. 91. A
written will of either real or personal estate cannot be revoked by parol. 1 Yerg.
§ 404; Peek, 301. Unless the supposed nuncupative will show, either in its body
or certiﬁcate of probate, that it was reduced to writing in the lifetime of the tes
tator, and read over to him and approved, it is a nullity. Woodward v. Wood
ward, 5 Sneed, 49, 63. Revocation by burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating,
eto. Unlike most of the States, we have no statute on this subject. But it has
been held that where the maker of a will burned a paper supposing it to be her
will, with the intention of revoking it, but by her mistake or the fraud of others,

burned a different paper, and always afterwards treated the will as destroyed and
revoked, and died in that belief, this amounted to a revocation. Smiley v. Gam
brill, 3 Head, 164. So if the testator told a person to burn the will, and supposed

that it had been done, although it was not done, this would amount to 1|. revoca
tion. Ford v. Ford, 7 Hurnph. 92, 104. A sale of the property devised is a revo'
cation to the extent of the property sold. Young v. Crowder, 2 Sneed, 156, 159;
Donohoo r. Len, 1 Swan, 119; Blair v. Snodgrass, 1 Sneed, 1, 24. Or any other
alteration in the 1-state between the making of the will and the denth of the testa
tor, is n revocation pro tanto. 1 Swan, 121. As to revocation by agreement
among devisces and legntees subsequent to the testator’s death, sec Nonnent v
Wilson, 5 Humph. 310.

that eﬁect, by will in writing, subscribed by herself, or by
some other person in her presence and by her direction; and
the subscription shall be made or the will acknowledged by
her, in the presence of at least two witnesses, subscribing the
will with their names in the presenccof the testatrix.

[Act 1s51-2, ch. 180, §4.]
See Q 2-184.
§ 2l69. Wills shall be proved and recorded and letters testa- mm om_ov_
mentary granted in the court of the county where the testator},
had his usual residence, at the time of his death; or, in case

he had ﬁxed places of residence in more than one county, in
either or any of said counties.
If letters testamentary are granted by the County Court of the wrong county’
the proper remedy is to apply to that court for n revocation of tho letters, and on
refusal, to prosecute an appeal or writ of error to the Circuit Court of the same

county : n. certiorari from the Circuit Court of the right county to the County
Court of the wrong county, will not lie. Johnson v. Gaines, 1 Cold. 288.—As to
the tinw within which letters testamentary may be granted, sce Q 2220, sub-sec. 4.

§ 2170. Every original will shall remain in the cle1'k’s oﬂlce Ormm‘

Of the probate of wills in com.mo.n form under this section, the County Court has
original and exclusive ju/risdiction. Burrow v. Ragland, 6 Humph. 481, 486. This is

free from question.

Hodges v. Bauchman, S Yerg. 186, 188; Townsend v. Town

ble. Brown v. Brown, 10 Yerg. 93; Buchanan v. Matlock, 8 Iiumph. 390. If the

This section prescribes the mode of proving wills per testes, or “ in solemn form."
The difference between our practice and that of England is, that under the English
practice the probate in common form, (Q 2171,) and the probate in solemn form take
place in the same court, and according to the course of the civil lnw ; while un

der our statute, 11 probate in solemn form can only take place in the Circuit Court
upon a case certiﬁed from the County Court under the provisions of the next ar
ticle. Robert.-1 v. Stewart, 2 Swan, 162, 165-6. Under the old law, Act 1789,
ch. 23, Q 1, the probate in solemn form was upon an issue of “ will or no will”

made up, and ajury trial in the County Court.

See Hodges v. Buuchman. 8 Yerg.

§ 7 Hump. 408-10.

The mode of procedure under this statute is discussed at length in Cornwell
v. Comwell, 11 Humph. 485, and that pursued in Harvey v. Smith, I Dev. 8: Bat.
Law R. 188, distinguished from the others and approved ; and the mode of pro

cedure there laid down was declared to be the correct one in Keith v. Raglan,
I Cold. 474, where the question came more directly before tho court. The party
desiring to contest the will, ﬁles his petition in tho county court, setting forth
the nature of his interest, and the grounds on which the contest is to be made.
I Cold. 475; ll Humph. 486, 487. The petition must be sworn to. 1 Cold.

§ 477.

Ii‘ this is not done, it may be dismissed on motion in the county court; but

a motion in the circuitcourt to dismiss for this cause, comes too late. 1 Cold.
§ 477-8. The prosecution bond is then given, Q 2173 ; or the pauper oath ﬁled, Q
§ 2176. But if this is not done in the county court, it may be done'iu the circuit
court. 1 Cold. 476. The executor is then summoned to appear and ansrvcr the
petition. 1 Cold. 475. He must be made a party, or tho proceeding is void.
§ 11 Humph. 487-8; Burrow v. Rngl-and, 5 Humph. 481, 486. And all other per
sons interested, either for or against the will, have n right to be mnde parties.
Patton v. Allison, 7 Humph. 320, 328 ; 11 IIumph. 487. And since these
decisions, the act. embodied in {Q 2174, 2175, was passed, requiring adult lega
tees and devisees having notice to givc bond “for the faithful prosecution of
the suit,”—which probably means their side oi‘ the suit, as the aﬂirrnative of the
issue, and the general burden of proof is upon them. See Puryear v. Reese, cited
below. Whether legutees and dcvisees are to have notice, as of course, does
not appear from any of the cases
The executor, being summoned, should make defence by answer to the petition.
§ 11 Humph. 487. Upon the case thus presented, the County Court may either set
aside the former probate, and send up the case to the Circuit Court for issue and
trial, or refuse to do so. 1 Cold. 475. But this dictum must be qualiﬁed with
the remark that although ithas been the usual practice in the County Court, upon
certifying the will and the fact of contest to the Circuit Court, to enter an order set
ting aside the probate in common form.—Wynue v. Spears, 7 Humph. 894, 406 .'
Burrow v. ltagland, 6 Humph. 486; Comwell v. Cornwell, ll Humph. 486; Ed
monsou v. Carrol, 2 Sneed. 681; Roberts v. Stewart, 2 Swan, 162, 165; yet the
later cases are to the effect that the County Court has no power to make such an or
der, and that it is inoperative. Byrn v. Fleming, 8 Head. 668, 662. At least where
the probate in common form took place at a previous term. Roberts v. Stewart,
§ 2 Swan, 162, 165. The rule certainly goes to the extent that the order setting
aside the probate had only the elfect of suspending the probate, as to any rights
that may be dependent upon it as an establishment of the will. 2 Sneed. 680 ; 2
Swan, 166
The County Court sometimes appoints a special administrator pendente lite. 2
Sneed. 681', Ford Y. Ford, 7 Humph. 92, 94. But where this is not done, the ex
ecutor, or administrator with the will annexed, to whom letters have been issued
under the original probate, is not relieved from his responsibilities or denuded of

his powers, except so far as rights under the will are concerned.

In his action he

cannot conﬂict with the provisions of the will, or the rules of law that would ap~

ply in cases of intestacy.

In this respect, his powers and duties are the same as

those of an administrator ad litem, who is a full administrator for the time, unless
his powers are limited in his appointment, and may sue and be sued. 2 Sneed, 862;
Byrn v. Fleming, 3 Head. 658, 662. See} 2204a.
From the judgment of the County Court, either party may appeal. 1 Cold. 475;
§ 7 Humph. 406; 11 Humph 486. In Howell v. Whitchurch, 4 Hnyw. 49, there is
a dictum to the effect that certim-ari is the proper remedy; but the law here, as
in most other cases, probably is, that this remedy is only available, where the
party can show cause for not appealing. See Wilson v. Frazier, 2 Humph. 801
§ 82, and Q 3124, and note.
The judgment of the Circuit Court upon the appeal is, either that the pro.
ceedings of the County Court be quashed, as in 7 Humph. 394, 410; or that the
i§ue of dvtvisatit vel non be made up, as in 1 Cold. 474, 478.
The ple¢din_qs.—No particular form of issue is required by the statute. The
party propounding the paper aﬂirms it to be the testat0r's will, and the contesting
party denies it. Ford v. Ford, 7 Humph. 92, 95; Harrison v. Morton, 2 Swan,
§ 461, 466. The general issue lets in all matters of defence, and under it the will
may be sustained in part and set aside in part. 2 Swan, 464-, 468. As in Guthrie
v.0wen, 2 Humph. 202, where a will was sustained as to the disposition of personalty,
but adjudged void as to devises of realty. In this case there was a single issue of
“ will or no will ” made up, not by pleadings ﬁled, but by an entry of record. It
seems that where the contestant only attacks the will in part, he may do so by a
special plea or pleas, if he desires to do so, with u view of saving cost, or for other
reason; but if he pleads the general issue, special pleas become unnecessary, and
it is not error to strike them out. 2 Swan, 465-7.
In making up the issue upon the supposed will of a married woman the instru
ment conferring upon her the testamentary power, (Q 2168,) forms no part of the
issue, but must appear in evidence. Mullins v. Lylcs, 1 Swan, 337.

“All the living wi!ncsaes."—Act 1789, ch. 23, Q 1;

§ 2172, 2178.

The only

change produced in the common law by this act, is the requirement of all the
living witnesses, to be found within the jurisdiction of the court Where the at
testing witnesses, to a deed, will, or other instrument, reside without the jurisdic
tion of the court, in another State or foreign country. secondary proof of the
handwriting is admissible. Crockett v. Crockett, Meigs, 95, 97 ; Stump v.
Hughes, 5 Ilayw. 93, 96; Haggard v. Mayﬁel d, Ib., 121 ; Harrcl v. Ward, 2 Sneed,
§ 610; Jones v. Arterburn, 11 Humph. 97. Or where the witness is dead. 5
Hayw. 96; Ib., 121 ; 2 Sneed, 610. Or in case he has become incompetent. 11
Humph. 99. If the attesting witness resides out of the State the proponent of
the will is not bound to take his deposition; but if he takes it he cannot with
hold it and iudroduce secondary evidence of his handwriting. Ib. The rule as
stated in this case is, that the subscribing witnesses must be produced if to be found,
withip the meaning of the Act of 1789. If not-, evidence of their handwriting must
next be resorted to. Where, from the eﬂlux of time or circumstances, it is shown
upon diligent inquiry that the handwriting of one or more subscribing witnesses
cannot be proved, proof of the signature of one witness and that of the testator;
and lastly upon failure ofproof of the signatures of all the witnesses, proof of the
handwriting of the teststor by two witnesses, will authorize the paper to be sub
mitted to the jury, upon which they may ﬁnd the fact of execution. In all cases
depending upon secondary evidence, the signature of the testato r, though not ab
solutely essential, ought to be superadded to that of the subscribing witnesses.

Ib,10a
“ If to befounrl."—This means if to be found by the oﬂicer having the subpoena.
to execute. Mi.-Donald v. McDonald, 5 Yerg. 9-07, 309. But it‘ it be established
at the trial by proof that the subscribing witness is a non-resident of the State,
the issuance and return of n subpoena, is, it seems, unnecessary. Crockett v.
Crockett, Meigs, 95, 97. Secondary evidence will also he let in where the witness is within the jurisdiction of the court, but cannot be found after strict and dili
gent inquiry. 2 Sneed, 613. But tho mere absence of the witness beyond the
process of the court, is not of itself sufficient to let in secondary evidence. 1b.,
§ 614. The rule of the American courts seems to be, that the absence of the sub
scribing witness beyond the jurisdiction at the time of the trial, for a temporary
purpose, where the return of the witness within a limited time is reasonably cer
tain, is not a suﬂicient ground for the introduction of secondary evidence; that to
render secondary evidence admissible, it must be shown that the witness is a non
resident. Ih., 613-14. See also the learned note of Mr. Meigs, 1 Moigs R. 97-8.
Proof of deeds by subscribing witnesses, seeé 2047 at seq. Parol evidence will

§ 272, 300, and in Harrison v. Morton, 2 Swan, 461, 470. Nor to show that the
testator intended to make any other disposition of his property than such as is
directed by the will, or that he was deceived as to the legal import of the will, if it clearly appear that the will was read over to him before it was signed, and that
he was made capable of understanding its provisions. 2 Swan, 46S—71. Nor to
show that the testator meant to use the word “sons " instead of “children." 9
Humph. 272, 287-303, where the question how far parol evidence is admissible,
to explain ambiguities in a will is discussed at length, with the citation of many au
thorities. Nor to explain an ambiguity raised by proof and not appearing on the

face of the will ; but an ambiguity in regard to the identity of a person named in
the will, as where there is another person of the some name, may be explained by
parol. Ward v. Espy, 6 Humph. 447; 9 Humph. 272, 293.
Evidence that the will was revoked by subsequent sale is irrelevant, and inad
missible in this proceeding, but would be competent in an action of cjectment be
tween the vendee and devisee. Young v. Crowder, 2 Suecd, 156.

The judgment of ﬂu: Circuit Court, if against the will, has the effect to revoke
and anuul the former probate, which was suspended during the contest so for as
rights under the will were concerned ; but if for the will, it has the effect merely
to atlirm it. Roberts v. Stewart, 2 Swan, 161, 165-6; Edmonson v. Carroll, 2
Swan, 678, 680--3. After the issue is found in favor of the validity of the will,
there is no probate in the County Court. It has already been proved upon the
trial of the issue, and it is sent back to the County Court to be recorded, and that
letters testamentary may be granted thereon. Patton v. Allison, 7 Hnmph. 820»

§ 328; 4 Cold. '79.
Judgment conclusive.—Thc probate of a will being in the nature of a proceeding
in rem, if before a competent court it is in general conclusive, and binds all par
ties interested, whether named as parties or not, and all courts, both of law and
equity, foreign as well as domestic. Williams v. Saunders, 5 Cold. 60, 71-4. An
exception to this rule is, that the probate in common form, Q 2171, is exparte and nou
conelusive, and may be contested under the statute. Roberts v. Stewart, 2 Swan,
§ 162, 165. Even after a lapse of eighteen years, and perhaps longer. Gibson v

lane, 9 Yerg. 475.

But it is settled by numerous decisions that the judgment of

the (ﬁreuit Court is conclusive and ﬁnal upon all persons interested whether par
ties to the record or not. Patton v. Allison, 7 Humph. 320, 328; Fry v. Taylor,
§ 1 Head, 594; Roberts v. Stewart, 2 Swan, 162, 165. Even though the contest
be made by a. single heir, where there are many others whose interest it is to dc.
feat the probate of the will. Ford v. Ford, 7 Hurnph. 92, 94. And so where the
probate of wills in solemn form took place in the County Court, under the law as
it stood prior to the act of 1835, the judgment of that tribunal was, upon the same
principle, held equally binding and conclusive.

Hodges v. Bauchman, 8 Yerg.
And on an appeal from the judgment of the (Hrcuit Court sustaining a will,

The Act of 1823 criticised and expounded, in Williams v. Saunders, 5 Cold. 60,
§ 68 ct seq.——“ According to the laws of this Qtnte.” Reason and policy of this pro
vision. 5 Cold. '76. The law is the same in case of deeds executed in another
State, or in a foreign country, conveying lands situated in this State. See Q 2040
and note. This statute, Act of 1823, eh. 31, §§ ‘Z182 to 2190, inclusive, applies
only to wills of real or immoveable property. Personal, or nioveublc property is
presumed to follow the person of the owner, and hence, as to wills of such prop

erty, the law ol" the tcstutor’s domicil governs.

§ 6 Cold. 76, 76-'79.

In a. case

where the will is that of a married woman, disposing of her separate estate, her
domicil is that of her husband. Ib., 79. See Q 2184 and note, and Q 2190 and
§ 110%.

“ And certiﬁed in the manner prescribed in the act of Congress. For this act
see anlc, page 175. The clerk ought to certify a literal copy of the probate from
the record, to the end that it may appear whether or not the will has been proved
in the mode prescribed by law ; a recital by him of what may be deemed its im
port is unauthorized and inadmissible. lle must not onl_\' certify that the paper
purporting to be a copy of the will, is a true copy of the will as it appears of rec
ord in his oﬂice, but he must in like manner certify as to the copy of the pro
bate of the will. Harris v. Anderson, 9 llumph. 7 79.
If the certiﬁcate does not embrace the probate it is fatal.

Cold. 488, 512.

§ 1008

Mai-r v. Gilliam, 1

When the probate made in another State read, “ This will was
proved,” etc., without describing it by the testator or its contents, it was held
luﬂicient. The decisions of this State in relation to the probate of deeds made
in other States was never intended to embrace the probate of wills ; because the
reason could not exist»—-only one will of the same person could ﬁnd a place upon
the records. McGuire v. Hay, 6 Humph. 419, 422.
See Q 2045 and note; Q 2067; Q 2086 and note. A copy of the probate in the
following words : “ Tho forgoing will was duly proven and ordered to be record
ed," is suﬂicient. The use of the word “foregoing” imports that the will was
spread upon the record preceding the entry of the probate. But it will not be
regarded as material, where the instrument comes duly certiﬁed from another
State, whether it appears that it was spread on record or kept on ﬁle.‘ The man,

ner in which ditferent governments keep their records do not affect their validity
or verity as such.

force and effect as it‘ the original had been executed in this

State, and proved or allowed in the courts of this State.
[Act 1823, ch. 31, § 1.]
Where an authenticated copy of a foreign wiil is presented to the County Court
under this Statute, the ordering it to be ﬁled and recorded is not a. matter of
course. The county Judge has something to do--some legal discretion toexercise.
He must determine whether the paper presented is duly authenticated according
to the Act of Congress; whether the Court in which the will purports to have
been allowed had jurisdiction; whether there is any real estate in his county on
which the will may operate; and if it contains a devise of real estate, whether
under our statute it has been proven before presentation according to the laws of
this State. Williams v. Saunders, 5 Cold. 60, 81-2. Where the County Judge [or

Quorum Court] in such a. case refuses to admit the will to probate or to make
any order of record in the cnse, a mandamus lies in the Circuit Court to compel
him to enter up a judgment; but the Court issuing the writ will not direct the

County Judge how to proceed, or what judgment to render.

Act of 1715, ch. 48, Q 2; 1777, ch. 2,§ 62; 1789, eh. 23; 1794, ch. 1, Q 47.
Under these acts no provision having been made for administration upon the
estates of non-residents, held, that the County Courts had no jurisdiction to grant
letters in such cases. Nelson v. Griﬂin, 2 Yerg. 624. This decision produced

the act of 1831, ch. 24, providing for administration in such cases. But it was
afterwards decided on general grounds that as a foreign administrator could not administer in this State, the goods of a deceased non-resident being in this State,
were an necessitate, subject to administration here.

And now the question is set

tied by Code, § 2203.
The jurisdiction of the County Court over the subject of administration is origi
nal, general and exclusive, and whatever it does in the exercise of the same will

be presumed to have been rightly done.

It is in this respect a superior and not

an inferior court, and its record need not show the residence or the intestacy of

the deceased, or the grounds on which the Court acted. Every presumption is
in favor of its jurisdiction. Brien v. Hart, 6 Humph. 131, overruling Nelson v
Griﬂin, 2 Yerg. 624; and see Campbell v. H‘Irwin & Lusk, 4 Hayw. 60, 61 ; Gwin
v. Vanzant, 7 Yerg. 143; King v. Vaughan, 8 Yerg. 60; Gray v. Farris, 7 Yerg.
§ 161; Townsend v. Townsend, 4 Cold. 70. This jurisdiction is commensurate

with the limits of the county where the deceased had his residcnce, and is to
that extent exclusive, and letters granted by the County Court of any other
county are void. Wilson v. Frazier, 2 Humph. 30. So a probate of a will in the
wrong county is void. Pinkerton v. Walker at ux, 3 Hayvv. 222. But administra

An administrator is not clothed

Feltz v. Clark, 4 Humph. 79.

But if he has

entered upon the administration without giving bond, discharged the debts of the
estate and settled with some of the distributees, he will be permitted to give bond
and continue in the oﬂice, in preference to another person applying for a grunt of
letters. Ib. Under our statutes, the will alone confers upon the executorno
title or power over the goods of the testator. Baldwin v. Buford, 4 Yerg. 16, 20 ;
Robertson v. Gains, 2 Humph. 367, 381. Until bond given the executor can do
no valid act touching the estate. Martin v. Peck, 2 Yerg. 298. His assent will

Before this statute it was held that an administrator might voluntarily surren

thought advantageous to the estate. McGowan v. \Vade, 3 Yerg. 375. But

where there are more administrators than one, and only one of them resigns, the
appointment of an administrator dc bani: non in his stead is void. The adminis

The dutiu of the two olliccs are distinct, and in case of death the appointment of

The executor is not bound to include in the inventory the proceeds of laud de

WHAT ABE ASSETS, AND WHAT NOT.

B0mLr.—Ncither n bond of indemnity given to the testator, nor n judgment re
covered by him thereupon, is assets in the hands of his executor, except to he ap
plied to the purpose of the indemnity; and he cannot be charged with it on the
ground that with due diligence he might have collected it. But if he have col
lected it, and any part remain in his hands unclaimed by the person against whose
demands the indemnity was given, the residunry legatees may compel a distribu
tion in equity. Molloy v. Elam, Meigs, 590. Bonds and notes executed for ob

jects which have been attained are not assets, and should be left with the obligors
in whose possession they are found. Clark v. Clark, 8 Hnyw. 23, 26.
Slaves were assets, when. The cases on this subject are omitted as obsolete.

See Heiskel1's Digest, p. 47, 48; Armstrong v. Pearre, 7 Cold. 171.
Lands agreed, or directed to be |old.—-Upon the principle that in equity what
ever is agreed to be done is considered as done, money agreed to be laid out in
land, is considered as land; and land agreed to be turned into money is consid
ered asmoncy. Stephenson v. Yandle, 3 Hayw. 109, 115, 122. Hence, upon the
death of a vendor of land before the execution of the conveyance, although the

legal estate in the land agreed to be sold devolves upon his heir, yet his executor
or administrator is entitled to receive the purchase money. So upon the death of
the vendee, his equitable interest in the land will descend to his heir, or will pass

by his will in general words descriptive of the estate. Ib. See to the same general
effect Myrick"s heirs v. Boyd, 3 Hayw. 179; Atchison v. Surguine, 1 Yerg. 400;
Craig v. Lciper, 2 Yerg. 193, 195 ; Campbell v. Campbell, 8 Head, 325. S0
where land is devised to be sold and invested in stocks, the heir is excluded from
the land and the proceeds. McComiick v. Cantrell, 7 Yeig. 615, 625. Buta guar
dian or executor has no power to change the personal property of an infant into
realty. If this is done and the infant dies before twenty-one, equity will consider
the laud as personalty and divest the legal title out of the infant's heirs, and vest it

in the distributees.

Roberts v. Jackson, 3 Yerg. 77.
Money paid on an Imexcculed verbal purchase where the seller declines to convey,
is personal assets which the administrator is bound to collect; and if he fails

§ 2257. Where no person will administer on the estate of

him in his lifetime may issue a scire facias against his heirs
or devisees, to whom, in case they are minors, the court shall
appoint a guardian ad litem for the purpose of defending the
suit; and, on return of the scire facias made known to the
guardian and heirs or devisecs, the plaintiff may prosecute his
suit to judgment and execution against the real estate of the
ancestor descended or devised to the said heirs or devisees.

[Act 1s09, ch. 121, § 3.]
Mr. lleiskell cites Boyd v. Armstrong, 1 Yerg. 40, 55, as deciding in effect, that
the Act oi‘ 1809, (though not referred to in either of the prevailing opinions) ap
plied only to suits pending, and not to judgments rendered, against the ancestor.

The svire facias should call upon the heirs to show cause why the plnintiﬁ
should not proceed against them in the action which depended against the ancestor
at the time ofhis death, to the trial of the issues therein joined, and to verdict and
judgment in respect of the real estate descended tothem. Smith v. Stump’; Heirs,
Peck, 278, 283. If it also call upon them to show cause why the suit should not
be revived against them, it is untechnieal, but not fatally erroneous. lb. It is

not a good plea. in abatement that the defendants had not at the time of issuing the
writ, nor at any time before or since, any lands by descent as heirs.

The proper

judgment is that the debt and costs be levied of the lands descended generally.

Judgment for costs cannot be given

The creditor is entitled to the fund and noth

after which the debtor died, the scire facia-I should cite his heirs to show cause
why execution should not issue against the real estate of the ancestor to them dc
scendcd. There is no authority for a simple rcvivor of judgment against heirs

by scircfaoiaa.

[Act 1784, ch. 11, § 2.]
The judgment entered is that the plaintiff recover of the administrator the sum

ascertained, to be levied of the goods of the intestate hereafter to come into his
hands to be administered. See Green v. Shaver, 3 Humph. 139-40-1. The judg
ment against the personal representative is not s lien on the lands in the hands of

the heir. Peck v. Whcaton, Mart & Ycrg. 353. Where the entry of the judg
ment read :--“Plene adrninistrauil,-—-jury No. 5 sworn, say they ﬁnd for the
plaintiﬁ' damages £103 16s ”;-this was not evidence that the personal estate hud

been fully administered, but the reverse.
A. justice may determine such a plea.

Gray v. Darby, Mart. 6: Yerg. 396, 401.

See next article and note.

Exhaustion of Pm-sonalty.—-'1'hc principle embodied in this and the next article,
that the personalty of a deceased debtor must be exhausted before the realty de
scended to his heirs can be subjected to the payment of his debts, has been estab
lished by a long serics ofjndicinl decisions. See Roberts v. Busby, 3 Hayw. 299 ;
Peck v. Wheaten, Mart. 8: Yerg. 359; Gray v. Darby, Ib., 896, 401 ; Boyd v. Arm

Shaver, 3 Humph. 139; Stockard v. Pinkard, 6 Humph. 119.

By the act of

§ 1777, ch. 2,§ 29, re-enacted by 1794, ch. 1, E 23, infra, Q 3026, executions are to
be levied ﬁrst upon the defendants pcrsbnalty; but if he have no personalty with
in the oﬂicer’s knowledge, then upon his realty. By Q 3498, the law is the same

with regard to attachments. Neither the set of 1794, (Q 3026,) nor the act of
Geo. II, (condensed in Q 2252,) authorized the sale of lands belonging to the an
cmtor which had descended to the heir, by virtue of a judgment against the ad
ministrator. 3 Hayw. 299, 304. The law as it existed in England prior to our

llevolution, and the effect of the act of Geo. II. and the acts of 1777 and 1794 are
elaborately discussed by judges Whytc, Emmerson and Haywood, in Boyd v. Arm

drong, 1 Yerg. 40-61.

The personal estate must be resorted to by ﬁeri farids, ifit

can be tested before the dcbtor’s death; otherwise, in case of a general creditor,
by scire facias against his personal representative. 1 Yerg. 60. Even though land

is levied on by attachment in the lifetime of the debtor, an order of sale tested after
his death will not support a sale. Green v. Shaver, 3 Humph. 139. And where land
is levied on by execution and tho debtor afterwards dies. and a vmditioni eapomu
issues, tested after his death, a sale under it is void. Stockard v. Pinkard, 6 Humph.
§ 119. The liability of the heir never arises, nor can he be charged to the extent of
lands descended, until the plea of fully administered is found in favor ofthe ancestor.
Gilman v. ﬁsdale, 1 Yerg. 285, 289; Elliot v. Patton, 4 Yerg. 10, 14. And if the
personal assets are wasted by the administrator, the loss must fall on the creditor,
and not on the heir. Peck v. Whcaton, Mart. 8: Yerg. 353, 359. Or, if the plea
of fully administered is found against the administrator, there is no remedy for
the creditor, either in law or in equity. Ib.; 1 Ycrg. 289. Except against the
administrator in his own proper estate. Mart. & Ycrg. 358-9; Anderson v. Clark,

This section of the Code modiﬁes the phraseolcgy of the original acts, so as to

enact the rule laid down in Combs v. Young, 4 Ycrg. 218, 231, and in Crutchﬁeld
v. Stewart, 10 Yerg. 237, 238, and in Carmichael v. Carmichael, 5 Humph. 96,
§ 98, that the arire facias must be served on the guardian and the heirs. Unless the
heirs have notice as well as the guardian, the proceeding is void. Ib. All the
heirs must have notice, or the proceeding is void as to those not having notice.
Simmons v. Wood, 6 Yerg. 518, 522. Thus, if some of the heirs are infants and
some adults, and they be not served, but the adults appear, the judgment, though
void as to the infants, is only voidsblc as to the adults, and to the extent of their
interest cannotbe impeached collaterally. Valentine v. Cooley, Meigs 613, 618.
The only exception to the rule that the heirs must be personally served is the

case of non-resident heirs embraced in the next section.

Roberts v. Busby, 3

llayw. 399.
Heirs must be named.—In Neivnan v. Maclin, 5 Hayw. 241, decided in 1813, the
validity of a title depending on a sale under judgment on scire facias, in which
the heirs were not specially named, was considered doubtful and left unresolved.
In Scwell v. Williams, 2 Tenn. 273, and in the same case, 6 Hayw. 280, it was

decided that where the scirr facias mentioned the heirs only by description and
there were two returns of nihil, the sale communicated a title which could not
be impeached collaterally. This was also in 1813. But in Bush v. Williams,
Cooke, 360, 862, decided in the Federal Court at Nashville in the same year, it
was said with reference to this subject, that no man can be bound by proceedings
to which he is not a party, and to make him n party he must be named. And it
is now ﬁrmly settled that the scirefacias must either name the heirs, or the sheriff
returning the fact of service, must name them in his return. Roberts v.
Busby, 3 Hayw. 299; Williams v. Seawall, 1 Yerg. 83; Henderson v. Overton, 2

shall order the trial of a collateral issue between the personal

On the contest between the creditor and administrator, averdict of “ no assets"
or “ not suflicient assets ” does not conclude the heir: he may contest the truth
of the ﬁnding upon scirc facias, and thus protect himself against collusion and

fraud on the part of the administrator and creditor.

Roberts v. Busby, 2 Hayw.

§ 299, s04.
Wllere the ancestor died before judgment, the heir is not limited to ndefenceby

he could have pleaded at common law in an action upon his ancestor-‘s bond. 2
Yerg. 10, 17, 21. The judgment against the personal representative does not
conclude him. lb. But the rule seems otherwise, if the judgment was rendered.

against the ancestor in his life-time ; for the ancestor could not have disputed it,
and his representatives can be in no better situation than he would be in, if living.
See Boyd v. Armstrong, 1 Yerg. 40, 44.

In such 8 case the heir may make any

defense “ the nature of his case will admit." Ib., 40. But a ﬁnding against the
administrator is conclusive upon the creditor. Peck v. Wheaten, Mart. 8: Yerg.
§ 353, 357.

If a defense is made by the heirs, it is a matter to be tried between

them and the administrator or executor; and if found against the latter, will dc
feat the acirefacias, and subject the administrator or executor, in his own proper
estate, to the payment of the debt. Anderson v. Clark, 2 Swan, 156, 160, and

next section.

But if the defense be not made by the heirs, the administrator or

executor need not appear in the proceeding by scire facias, and the judgment on
his pleain the former proceeding will be taken as admitted. Ib.

The judynent is for the lands descended and the necessary costs incident to
reach it. The fund alone is liable.

the County Court, and he appealed to the Circuit Court, giving bond whith sureties under the court act of 1794, ch. 1, Q 63 (Q 8161,) for the performance of the
judgment. of the Circuit Court, and he afterwards died, and no person administer

[Act 1s27,¢11. 54, § 4 ; 1ss1, ch. 22, § 1.]
Reason and policy of the Act of 1827: 1st.

To prevent the accumulation of

costs by numerous separate proceedings at law at the suit of each creditor. 2d.
To prevent the sacriﬁce of the estate in satisfying the ﬁrst few judgments that

might be obtained.

§ 3d. That the chancellor having an account of all the debts

before him, and an exact knowledge of the character, description and probable
value of the estate, should take the land into the custody of the court, and direct
its sale for the beneﬁt of all, under such circumstances as would secure the best

price.

Dulles v. Read, 6 Yerg. 53, 65-6.

Parties.--The administrator is a necessary party.

Ib., 68.

And so are the

heirs. Crippen v. Crippen, 1 Head, 128. And if one of them be not served with
process, the answer of the guardian ad lilem will not give jurisdiction. lb. Unless
the heirs or dcvisees are made parties, the sale is a nullity. Kites v. Johnson, 10

“ Debt: ortlemanda set forth in the bill or petition, and shown to exist.”—'l'hc

original act read, “ shown to exist in any such bill." This did not restrict tho pro

all such debts or demands as in the course of the investigation which originated
by the bill, may be shown to exist. 6 Yerg. 67, 68. See § 2332; 2381-2383.

“ Or paid by the representative out of his own meam."—Before the passage of
this statute it was held in ,Pca v. Waggoner, 5 Hayw. 1, and in the same case, 5
Hayw. 242, that a personal representative who pays debts beyond the amount of
assets in his hands, becomes a creditor of the estate, and has the same right of in
demnity against the heirs that other creditors have. Sec also, 6 Yerg. 44; 2
Sneed, 356; 4 Sneed, 482. In a bill for such substitution it is sullicient to state

the payment of debts generally, beyond the amount of the personal estate without particularly specifying the debts.

§ 5 Hayw- 242. In case the representative does

not take steps to enforce his demand in the time limited by the statute, he is
barred in like manner as any other creditor. 5 Hayw. 1 ; § 2279. And see as to

his right of retainer, note to § 2311.
Proof.

§ 2268. But, before making such decree, it shall be made to

appear to the satisfaction of the court that the personal estate
has been exhausted in the payment of bona ﬁde debts; and
that the debts or demands for which the sale is sought, are
justly due and owing either to creditors or to the representa
tive for advances out of his own means to pay just demands
against the estate. [Ib.]
The above provision in relation to the exhaustion of personal assets before any
decree shall be made, was only intended to preserve the policy of the former
legislation on the subject. If nftcr proceedings commenced, a sum should be
found in the ndministmtor’s hands unexhnustcd, this would not oust the court of
jurisdiction; but the chancellor must apply and exhaust it before making sale of
the land. Dulles v. Read, 6 Yerg. 68, 68. Hence the decree must be preceded
by nn investigation of the administrator’s accounts. Ib. Showing, ﬁrst, the asscis
received, or which ought to have been received, by him, and the bona _/ide debts
and charges paid by him; nud, 2d, the remaining bonaﬁdc debts and charges out

standing ngainst the estate, and these should be established by proof, rejecting all
claims barred by the act of 1789, ch. 23, § 4, Q 2279.) Crippen v. Crippen, I
Head. 128-ii. And a settlement of the administrator with the County Court is
pr-ima fat-ie evidence in his favor, (Q 2305); and if formal, accurate, and unoxcep
tcd to, suiﬁcient to authorize the sale. Curd v. Bonner, 4 Cold. 632, 638.

ofhis county.

§ 2272. Upon said papers, scire facias shall be issued, and all yhrg_<[¢:ﬁa_ing=
other proceedings be had for the satisfaction of such judg
ment, either out of the goods and chattels, lands and tene

out of the real estate of the deceased. [Ib.]
§ 2273. The like proceedings shall be had in ease of an exe- Proceedltngs on

[Ib., § 2.]
Before this statute the heirs could not be reached through at justice‘s judgment
Blount v. Hopson, 1 Yerg. 399.

This Act, 1822, ch. 43, and the Act of 1784, ch.

§ 11, [see preceding article], are to be construed together.
Swan, 156, 159.

Anderson v. Clark, 2

For they place a justice’s judgment on the same footing as a.

judgment of the Circuit Court as respects the modes of proceeding to obtain satis-~
faction. Hillman v. Hickerson. 3 Head, 575 ; Blount v. Hopson, 1 Yerg. 899. In
a suit against a personal representative before a justice, he may plead “ fully admin
istered, " “no assets,” or “not suﬂicient assets,” and it is competent for the justice
to try the same. 2 Swan, 159. The pleading before thejustice is in brief, and infor
mal. Ib. Informal defects do not vitiatc the proceedings; as where the oﬂicer
signed the return to the execution without stating his oilicial character. Ib., 167,
§ 159. The heirs are not concluded by the justices ﬁnding of“ fully administered,” but
may contest the truth of the same in the Circuit Court [under Q 2269-2262]. Ib., 160.
It seems that ajustioe's judgment in the following words: “Iﬁnd that there are
notes, bonds and judgments outstanding, more than sufficient to cover all the assets
ni defendant's hands, and therefore ﬁnd his plea true; but also enter judgment

against decedent's estate for the sum of nineteen dollars sixty-two and one-half
cents,” is a good ﬁnding of fully administered and judgment “quando aceide1-int."
Ib., 157. If in the CircuitCourt the heirs plcadthat the administrator has assets, it
is necessary to notify the administrator to appear and defend against the plea.
Otherwise if the cause originated in the Circuit Court ; for then the administrator
is already in court. Ib., 160.

being liable to suit and costs; and all suits commenced within
that period may be abated and dismissed at the plaintiﬂ"s cost,
except suits brought by sureties of the deceased, which may be
brought without delay.

[Act 1829, ch. 57, §§ 1, 2; 1831, ch. 23, §1.]
The general term “administrator” in our statutes includes administrators’ dc
bani: non. Shackleford v. Runyon, ‘I Humph. 141. An administrator de bani:
non who succeeds to the otlicc on the death of the original ndministrntor is by

this statute protected from suit for six months from the date of his qualiﬁcation.
Minor v. Webb, 1 Heisk. 395. But where the original administrator resigns under
Q 2237, his successor is protected from suit only for six months from the quali
ﬁcation of the ﬁrst administrator. Coleman v. Raynor, 3 Cold. 25, 29. See§
§ 2760.

§ 2275. To all suits brought within said period, with the ex

solvent. [Act 1831, ch. 23, § 2.]
§ 2276. And a judgment by confession or by default within
said time, against an administrator or executor, with the ex
ception aforesaid, shall be deemed void. [Ib.]
The object of the second section of the act of 1831 was simply to prevent favorit
ism, by which 0. preference might be given to some creditors over others. The
meaning of the word “ void” is that such a judgment shall be inoperative until
the expiration of the six months. Roche v. Washington, 7 Ilumph. 142. But
contra, Gonnun v. Swaggerty, 4 Sneed, 560, where it was held, construing this
statute, that a judgment rendered within the six months against an administrator
as garnishce, upon his answer in which he admitted the debt and assets, is alto
gether null und void, and no bar to a subsequent suit by the creditor.

That is, against the personal representative. Technically speaking, a judgment

may issue, citing them to show cause why the plaintiff shall not have execution

§ 2278. Except upon ajudgment obtained against the de

any executor or administrator until after twelve months from
his qualiﬁcation. [Act 1815, ch. 37, § 1; 1832, ch. 10, § 1.]
§ 2279. The creditors of deceased persons, if they reside ¢,¢.mmm.n¢
within this State, shall within two years, and if without, shall llirl:ldl;';l“;;
within three years from the qualiﬁcation of the executor or
administrator, exhibit to them their accounts, debts and
claims, and make demand, and bring suit fo1~/the recovery

thereof, or be for ever barred in law and equity.
[Act 1789, ch. 23, § 4.]
For the construction of this section, see in addition to the following Q 2784,
which is substantially the same as this. See also Herd v. Delp, 1 Hcisk. 530.
Even the State is bound by the statutes of limitation in favor of executors and
administrators. State v. Crutcher, 2 Swan, 504, 214.
“ Creditors of deceased person.r."—’I'his statute applies only to demands accruing

against deceased persons in their life-time, and does not apply to cases arising by
contract, express or implied, with the administrator. Such claims are affected by
the ordinary statutes of limitation. Allen v. Porter, 7 Humph. 373, 884. As
where a sheriﬂ' advanced money to pay taxes on decedent’s estate after his death.
Ib.--Where a claim against a decedent’s estate is paid by the distributees or lega
tees, they, by the fact of such payment, are substituted to the rights of ordinary
creditors, and unless they prosecute their claim for reimbursement within the
time limited by the statute, they are barred; but if the debt paid had been re

duced to judgment, they arc substituted to the rights of judgment creditors, and
the statute does not run against them. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 8 Humph. 859. A
acirefacias to revive a judgment rendered against the decedent in his life-time, is
a new action, and unless sued out within two years after the qualiﬁcation of the
personal representative, it is barred by the statute. Bank of State v. Vance, 9
Yexg. 471. Otherwise, it seems, where the scirefacias is to revive a suit still pend
ing. Ib.—-A surety is not a creditor within the meaning of this statute, until he
has paid the debt of his principal, or judgment has been rendered against him.

Hence the statute does not begin to run against him until that time.

Marshall v.

Hudson, 9 Yerg. 57, 62. And so, where there has been a recovery of the sheriff
for the misfeasancc of his deceased deputy, the statute begins to run against him
from the time of the recovery, if a personal representative of the deputy has pre
viously qusliﬁed. Atkins v. Scarborough, 9 Humph. 617.

“ From the qualiﬁcation," etc.—The statute does not begin to run until there is
a representative capable of being sued, and a creditor capable of suing. Bradford
v. McLemore, 3 Yerg. 318. And an executor or administrator cannot be sued

until his qualiﬁcation.

A suit instituted before that time is a nullity.

Fay v.

Reager, 2 Sneed, 200; Ward v. Bowen, Ib., 58. In computing the time, the day
of the qualiﬁcation of the personal representative is excluded. Elder v. Bradley,

§ 2 Sneed, 247.

Also rm six months during which he is not liable to suit.

Q 2760

Hence the bar does not attach until the expiration of two years and six months
from the date of qualiﬁcation. Maynard v. May, 2 Cold. 44, 61. And not then,
unless the demand is due at the date of qualiﬁcation ; for until that time, there is
no creditor capable of suing. 3 Yerg. 319. If the demand accrues after the qual
iﬁcation ol' the personal representative, the creditor has two years in which to sue
from the accrual of his demand. Ib. ; Trott v. West, 9 Yerg. 433, 436. And

qucry by the editors—adding thereto so much of the six months, during which
the personal representative is not liable to suit, as has not expired at the time of
the accrual of the demand ? See Maynard v. May, ut supra.
Whether the bill was ﬁled in time to save the bar of the statute, may be proved
by parol : the clerk’s certiﬁcate is not conclusive. Montgomery v. Buck 6 Humph
Where a deputy clerk who had charge of the clerk's oﬂice,‘left a person to I
§ 416.
receive and ﬁle bills during his absence, the receiving by such person of a bill, and
the endorsing thereon of the date of its reception, placing the same among the

papers of the otiice,--this is a sufficient ﬁling of the bill to save the bar of the
statute. Ib.
“ Administrators or e::ecutors."—-Administrator is here used as a correlative
term with executor, and means a full administrator, and not an administrator
pendants lite. The statute docs not run in favor of an estate while it is in tho
hands of an administrator pemlmtc lite. Houston v. Houston, 8 Ilumph. 652.
Promise to pay barred debt.-—-N0 admission or promise on the part of the ad
ministrator, after a debt has been barred can operate to defeat the statute. Trott
v. West, 9 Yerg. 488, 485. The some principle recognized in 9 Yerg. 63. Such
a promise will not bind the heir. Peck v. Whcaton, Mart. & Ycrg. 358, 361. But
where the legatces join with the executor in an agreement to pay a barred debt,
the agreement is valid. Reynolds v. Johnson, 9 Humph. 444.
Pleading the slal'ute.—The administrator is bound to plead the above statute ; a
neglect to do so will charge him for a dcvrutavil. Brown v. Porter, 7 Humph.
§ 378, 383; Byrn v. Fleming, 3 Head, 658 663. And see Puckett v. James 2,
Hnmph. 565. Where the complainants, administrators, prayed in their bill “that
they be allowed the beneﬁt of all such statutes of limitation or bar by lapse oi time,
as in the premises, they as administrators ought to claim, "-held, that this was
a pleading of the above stante, and no othcr. 7 Humph. 883, 384. For they are
not bound to plead any other.Ib. 384.
Where the statute is pleaded, and the plaintitf replies, alleging demand and a
special request for delay, the replication should conclude with a veriﬁcation, and
not to the country. McKamy v. Keller, 8 Yerg. 432.
Eject of.—This statute bars only the remedy, but does not extinguish the right.
Marshall v. Hudson, 7 Yerg. 6'7, 63. Hence, an action may be barred as
against the administrator of the principal obligor in a bond, while his surcties or
co-obligors continue liable. Ib.; Nashville Bank v. Campbell, 7 Yerg. 353, 363.
Tlma not

periods.

§ 2280. But if any creditor, after making demand of his
debt or claim, delay to bring suit, for a deﬁnite time, at the
special request of the executor or administrator, the time of
such delay shall not be counted in said periods of limitation.
[Ib. last p1'0vis0.]
For the construction of th-is section, see in addition to the following, § 2785,
which is substantially the same as this. Sec also Chestnut v. McBride, 1 Heisk.
§ 389, where the cases construing this section are reviewed, and their eilect shown.
In that case the creditor requested payment, and the administrator said, “ hold on, your claims are good." This was nut suﬁicient to take the case out of the
statute. Ib., 394. Where a. jury was sworn, “ well and truly to try the fact as
to whether demand had been made by the plaintiﬁ‘ of defendant for the payment
of the notes in controversy, and at what time, and if defendant had requested
plaintiff to delay.euforcing collection of the same ;“ and found, “that demand was

made by plaintiﬂ‘ in the month 0t'December, 1868, and delay requested by di-t'end
ant at said date”; this ﬁnding was not evidence of such a request l'or delay as is
required by the statute. Ib., 391, 394.
A written promise by the administrator to pay when money suil'icien_t comes
into his hands, renders him persnniilly liable in the event of suliicicnt assets, and
the question of the statute in such a case will not arise. McWl|erter v. J;|ckS0ll,
§ 10 Humph. 210.
Where the administrator is called to account fora devaatavit in paying a
barred debt, the same strictness of proof is not required to discharge him, as to
to enforce a recovery by the creditor against him. Puckett v. James, 2 Humph,

§ 565, 568; Rutledge v. Rutledge, Knoxv. 1853, cited in Heisk. Dig. pp. 71,
§ 78.

§ 2281. Infants, persons of unsound mind, and inarriedsmng.
women, may bring their several actions within one year after
the removal of their respective disabilities, notwithstanding
the lapse of said periods of two and three years; so that such
suit be brought within seven years after the death of the
debtor, if the cause of action accrued in his life time, or other

wise within seven years from the time the-cause of action
accrued.

[Ib. ﬁrst proviso; 1715, ch. 48, § 9.]

The ﬁrst clause of this section containing the saving in favor of persons under

disabilities, is the ﬁrst proviso of the act of 1789, ch. 23, Q 4. The second clause,
from the act of 1715, is a statute of limitation, and is substantially the same as
Q 2786.
.
It establishes what is called a positive prescription in contradistinction to a
negative prescription. The distinction is, that the statute of positive prescription
acts upon and extinguishes the right, while that of negative prescription aﬂects only

the remedy.

State v. Crutcher, 2 Swan, 504, 512.

It runs against the State. Ib.

It contains no exceptions in favor oi‘ persons under disabilities, and the courts

can therefore make none.

Foster v. Marley, 8 Ycrg. 224; Stone v. Sanders, 1

Head. 248; Williams v. Conrad, ll Hnmph. 412, 417. Hobbs v Ballard, 5
Sneed. 895, 405. It protects heirs and distribute-es, as well as personal represen
tatives; that is, it protects the estate of a decedent, after the expiration of seven
years from his death, against all creditors of the decedent, whether the estate be
in the hands of the personal representative, the heirs, or the distributces. Peck
v. Wheaten, Mart. 8: Yerg. 353, 360; Hobbs v. Ballard, 5 Sneed. 395, 406;

§ 2 Tenn. 317.

Although this statute admits of no exception in favor of persons

under disability, yet like the statute of 1789, (Q 2279,) it so fur admits of an
equitable construction, that it is held not to commence running against a credi
tor, until the time when his demand falls due. Caplinger v. Vadon, 5 Humph.
‘629. After the expiration of the seven years, the administrator ceases to have any
power over the estate, whereby he can affect the interests of third persons. He

cannot make a. deed for land after that

time under Q2025. Lewis v. Hick

necessary for the support of such widow and her family, until the expiration of one year after the dec-ease of her husband.

§ 2286. And the moneys and effects so set apart shall be the

Norxto Q! 2285, 2286.--Reason and policyof these provisions. Bayless v.
Bayless, 8 Cold. 359, 363; Sanderlin v. Sanderlin, 1 Swan, 441, 443; Vincent v.

Vincent, 1 Heisk. 838, 342.
“ County C'om-l."—'l‘his proceeding is no part of the administration of an estate i
and hence the Chancery Court, in exercising the power to grant administration,
cannot acquire jurisdiction of it. Polk v. Armour, Jackson Special Nov. Term,
§ 1867; cited 4 King Dig. 1 12,068. But unless the want of jurisdiction is objected
to in liminc, it is considered as waived. 1 Hcisk. 335.

“ So much of the crop,“ etc.—The allowance is intended to be of speciﬁc prop.
er-ty. Thus, where the husband’s estate consisted in a share in apartnership,
which his creditors were seeking to subject by bill in equity, it was held that
his widow could not go into the County Court and get an allowance in money,

and then set that up against the creditors. Greenwall v. Heeman, Brownsville,
§ 1868 ; cited in 4 King Dig. Q 12,072. The commissioners cannot vest the widow
with any articles not on hand at the time of their action. They cannot clothe
her with rights not conferred by the statute; if they do so, their action is a

mere nullity.

§ 4 Cold. 863-4. Nor is the widow entitled to an allowance out of

her husband's estate, for the value of such articles as may be designated in the com
missioner's report, as were not onhand at the death of her husband. Ib., 361, 363
§ 4; Bell v. Hcnter, Jackson, 1867, cited in 4 King Dig. Q 12,067; Heisk. Dig. p. 79.
Extent of the allowance.—This should be regulated by the state of facts existing
at the time of the intestates death, and not by any changes in the family within
a year afterward. 1 Heisk. 342-3. Thus if’ there are two step children living
with the widow at the time of the husband's death, the allowance should include
an amount necessary for their support; and if they arc afterwards taken away by a
guardian without the widow’s consent, the guardian is not entitled to any part of
the allowance. Ib.
In this case seven hundred dollars was adjudged to be a proper allowance to
a widow with ﬁve children. Ib. In Saiiderlin v. Sanderlin, 1 Swan, 441, 444,
the commissioners set apart certain groceries and provisions in kind, worth
in all less than one hundred dollars. This, for a widow with threc minor children
was held wholly inadequate; and for the widow’s necessities alone, the husband’s
estate being worth $15,000, was “niggardly in the extreme.”
From what fund taken.-The allowance must be taken out of the aggregate

personal estate before division, and not out of the remaining two thirds, after
setting apart one third of the entire estate to the widow. Turner v. Fisher, 4
Sneed, 209, 211. Sec note to Q 2288.
“And her_fanu'l_r/.”—'l‘l1e word “ family ” includes minor children residing with
the parent. It makes no difference whether they were children of the intestate
or offspring of a former marriage. Sandcrlin v. Snnderlin, 1 Swan, 441.
ehildren of the intestate by a former marriage. 1 Heisk. 341-2.
The tide to the property set apart passes at once to the widow.

§ 1He.isk- 342.

§ 2287-2288
§ 4 Cold. 863;

And if the executor or administrator gets possession of the prop

erty and sells it, the widow may maintain an action for the conversion. Curd v.
Curd, 9 Humph. 171, 172. Or may compel him to account for it in equity. 1
Heisk. 343-4. Unless the jurisdiction is objected to. Ib., 335. And to entitle

herto maintain her action it is enough that the legal relation of widow exists.
It is not required of her to show that previous to the sale she demanded the prop
erty, or made, or offered to make, a selection of the articles secured to her by
law, from the other property belonging to the estate. The statute forbids the
interference of the personal representative therewith. 9 Ilumph. 173. The com
missioners may set apart money on hand or due; and if the former, it passes at
ones to the widow. But if the latter, whether a right ofaction would immediately
accrue to the widow, on the note or other security evidencing the money due,
without the intervention of the personal representative, was expressly reserved in
Bayless v. Bayless, 4 Cold. 859, 368. But in Cate v. Little, 1 Thompson’s Cases,
§ 63, decided in 1850, this point was expressly resolved in favor of the \vidow’s
right to suc in her own name.

§ 2287. And if there be no widow, or she die before the year’s ‘Children to

size or solvency of the estate of the deceased, for herself, and in

istrator.

[Act 1855-6, ch. 99; 1ss3, ch. 2; 1841-2,011.4-1,§2.]
Construction.-—T11e exemption acts are to be construed together as different
parts oi‘ one act. See note to Q 2112 a. But before the Code the Act of 1841-2,
ch. 44, Q 2, was not to be construed in par-i materia with the poor laws. Curd v.
Curd, 9 Humph. 171, 172; Duncan v. Duncan, 2 Swan, 351, 352. This provision
is in addition to the year's support provided for in the preceeding sections. Tur
ner v. Fisher, 4 Sneed, 209, 211. And in addition to her distributive share of
her hnsband’s estate. Ib. Does this embrace only such articles as were exempt
by the Code, or does it embrace all that have been exempted by subsequent laws ?
See Duncan v. Duncan, 2 Swan, 351. Answer: It embraces both the articles ex
empt by the Code, and those exempt by subsequent laws. Vincent v. Vincent,
§ 1 Heisk. 333, 343-4. On the death of the husband intestate, or the dissent of
the widow from his will, (Q 2404,) the title to the exempt property instantly vests
in the widow by operation of law. The personal representative can have no con
trol or dominion over it, unless perhaps to select and set it apart for her beneﬁt,
in case other failure to do so. Bayless v. Bayless, 4 Cold. 359, 361. As was
said in Curd v. Curd, 9Humph. 171, 173. He can exercise no dominion over it
against her knowledge or consent. 4 Cold. 361. In case of intestacy she is cu
titicd to all the articles in specie enumerated in the statute as exempt from exe

cution, which are on hand at the death of hcr husband; or, in case of dissent
from the will, such only as are in the hands of the executor at the time of such dissent; and to none other. She cannot charge the estate of her deceased hus
band with the value of such of these exempt articles as are not thus on hand. 4
Cold. 360, 362. These articles must be taken from the aggregate personal estate

before division.

not abate or be extinguished by his death ; but shall pass to

his personal representative for the beneﬁt of his widow and
next of kin, free from the claims of his creditors.
[Act 1831-2, ch. 17; extended]
§ 2292. The action may be instituted by the personal repre
sentative of the deceased; but if he decline it, the widow and
children of the deceased may, without the consent of the rep
resentative, use his name in bringing and prosecuting the
suit, on giving bond and security for costs, or in the form
prescribed for paupers. The personal representative shall
not in such case be responsible for costs, unless he sign his

The above three sec-'ion.w are similar to the 9 8: 10 Vic. ch. 93. For the reason
and policy of these provisions, see Bream v. Brown, 5 Cold. 168, 171.

Corwtruction, Q 2291.—Wc must look to the intention of tho Legislature, and
give to the words all possible meaning consistent with the language used. Ib.,
§ 171. It is to be construed in pari mater-ia with the original Act of 1S_5l-2, ch.
§ 1'7. Ib. An action for damages sustained in the death of another did not lie at
common law. Hall v. Nashville, air. Chattanooga R. R. C-0., 1 Thompson's Cases,

§ 20-1.

Nor does this statute give damages for the more act of killing.

The dam

ages recoverable are for what was incurred or suffered while the person lived.
If the killing is instantaneous, damages are not recoverable. Louisville and Nash
ville R. R. Co. v. Burke, 6 Cold. 45, 52. The damages recoverable are those suf
fered by the person killed, and which he could have recovered, had he lived; and not those suﬂ'ered by his widow and children, in consequence of his being killed.
Ib., 49. The action is given for injuries or wrongs causing the death of the person

injured.

It cannot be sustained unless death was the natural and proximate con

sequence of the acts proved.

Wagner v. Woolsey, 1 Heisk. 285.

“Person,” Q 2291.—This word embraces all and every individual.

Bream v.

Brown, 5 Cold. 168, 171. It iucludesall classes; and every one is embraced who
if death had not ensued, could have maintained the action. Ib., 178. And see

Hcltlahon v. Mayor, 83 N. Y. R., 642.

It embraces a wife as well asa husband.

§ 5 Cold. l74. If the wife lives, she has a right of action for the injuryjointly with
herhusband; if she dies, the right passes to her personal representative. Ib.,
§ 175. And it seems that if the personal representative is not the husband, the
husband is no longer a necessary party. Ib., 174.
“Shall not abate," etc., Q 2291; “shall proceed without rcvivor," Q 2293.
The action proceeds to ﬁnal judgment in the name of the deceased person—a mere
naked name ofrecord—l'or the use of the widow and next of kin, who are the

real parties to the action.

Upon suggestion and proofof the denth of‘ the plaintiﬁ‘,

a motion to abate will not lie. Chambers v. Porter, I5 Cold. 273, 278. And it
seems that if the defendant desires to have some person of record to answer for
costs, he should move for the attorney for the prosecution to show by what au

thority=he continues to prosecute the su‘-it; and that the production of the author
ity would make the persons bound thereby answerable for the costs. Ib., 279.
IE, upon suggestion and proof of the death of the pfaintill; the cause is continued
on the application of the defendant, it is not error to award judgment against de
fendant for the costs o'l‘ the term. Ib., 274, 279. See {Q 2942. 2943.
Place ofaction.—‘1f.-the injury which caused the intes-tatc's death took place in
another State, the action will not lie in this State. Nashville & Chattanooga R.

The administrator or executor is entitled to retain "necessary charges and

See Q 2811 and note.

“ Reasonable oompcnsation,” etc.—Bel'ore this statute, it was held in Bryant v.
Puckett, 8 Hayw. 252, 254, that an executor or administrator is not, as against

creditors allowed to retain anything in his hands for his personal serviccs.—
But now an allowance of $200 to an executor for collecting assets amounting to
more than $10,000, is not excessive. German v. German, 7 Cold. 180, 186.

Nor is an allowance of $360 for collecting and distributing the proceeds of
the sale of land, amounting, with interest, to over $12,000.

[Act 1822, ch. 31,§ 2; 1837-8, ch. 118, § 5.]
Before the Act of 1822 the cases on this subject were conﬂicting ; Greeulee v.
Hays, 1 Tenn. 300, and Basham v. Blakcmore, 1 Tenn. 348, being in favor of
the rule laid down in the text; while Stephenson v. Stephenson, 3 Hayw. 123, and
Stephenson v. Yandcl, 5 Hayw. 261, were against it. But under the Act of 1822,

it was held that where the parties interested, being of age, attended. the settle
ment in poison or by attorney, the account could not be opened for supposed mistakes, in the absence of fraud, after the lapse of twelve years. Burton v.
Dickinson, 3 Yerg. 112, 119. In such a case the settlement has the conclusive

character of a. stated account, and can only be opened by a bill to surcharge or
falsify. Ib., 119; Turney v. Williams, 7 Yerg. 172, 211. But where the parties
are infants and without guardians; where no one attends at the settlement, and

the order and settlement is wholly ez parte;-such ll settlement is only prime
fade evidence against the distributecs, and is liable to be opened and reviewed
by a bill asking for an account generally. 7 Yerg. 213; Elrod v. Lancaster, 2
Head. 671, 575. The settlement is primafacie evidence in favor of the executor
in taking the general account, and no more. 2 Head. 275; Milly v. Harrison,
§ 7 Cold. 191, 213. But on an application to sell slaves to pay debts under the Code,
Q 2247 cl uq., it was held that if the settlement is formal, in detail, accurate in

all its parts and uncxcepted to, it might so far constitute the basis of the mas
ter's report, as to authorize the chancellor to direct tho sale.

§ 180, 185. An estate is chargeable with the costs of the litigation necessarily in

Right of retainer-.—lf the administrator is it creditor, he cannot sue himself to
ascertain his debt, and have execution of the assets. He must therefore retain;
and the property, or rather, the proceeds of it, by operation of law become his
own. Ross v. Wharton, 10 Yerg. 190, 192; Wharton v. Marberry, 3 Yerg. 603,

whether to set up the statute or not; but in regard to his own demand, he is
intrusted with no such discretion. 3 Hcnd, 663; 10 Humph. 803, where the
reason of the rule is stated; 3 Sneed, 607. And though the bar of the statute
had not attached at the‘timc he entered upon the administration ; yet unless he
makes known his demand, and his intention to retain before the time of the
statute expires, he will not be permitted to retain. 3 Sneed, 607; recognized
and approved in 3 Head, 663. How he is to “make known his demand, and his in
tention to retain it,” does not very clearly appear from the case in 3 Snccd, un.
less it be by presenting his claim against the estate with the others on ﬁnal set
tlement in the County Court, at the end of two years after qualiﬁcation; and then
he may not be in time. Sec Ilamner v. Hamner, 8 Head, 898, 403. If he fail to

retain

within the two years of Q 2279, he will he barred.

§ 3 Head, 658,

§ 662; Ib., 408. But in Smith v. Watkins, 8 Humph. 331, 341, it is held upon a
review of numerous authorities that no act is necessary to be done by an execu
tor to constitute a retainer; no volition on his part as to whether he will retain

or not; but the moment he receives assets sufficient to discharge his debt, the
law applies them in payment, and the debt becomes extinct instnnter. And
though after the qualiﬁcation of an executor, the County Court, upon certifying tho fact of contest of the will to the Circuit Court, makes an order setting
aside the probate in common form, (Q 2171,) this does not change the power of the
executor as to the personal estate, nor arrest the running of the statute of
two years, in respect of his own demand; for the order annulling the probate is
void. 8 Head. 662. But where the executor is vested by the will with power to

make settlements without limit of time, he is not subject to be barred of his right
to retain.

H-amner v. IIamner,_3 Head, 398, 403.

If an executor who has a right to retain for his debt, fails to do so, hut, after
receiving assets snilicient to satisfy his debt, pays them out in discharge of other

debts against the estate, or transfers them to an administrator do bonis non, his
right to recover for his debt islost. Smith v. Watkins, 8 Humph. 831, 888. For,
as soon as assets suﬂicient come into his hands to discharge his debt, the law ap
plies them in the payment of the same without any act of his. They extinguish
his debt by operation of law, and become his property; and if he aﬂerwards pays
them out to others, it is his folly. 1b.; Ross v. Wharton, 10 Yerg. 190, 191-2.
Contra, Wharton v. Marberry, 3 Sneed, 608, 607 ; Hamner v. Hamner, 8 Head, 898,
§ 403. But it was said that the rule that the reception of assets is an extinguish
ment of the oxecut0r's debt, does not apply in case of insolvent estates. 8Humph.

As to the personal representative's right to indemnity, where he has paid debm

§ 2312. Any distributee or legatee of the estate may, af'tc1'}’,,‘,f,‘,§f‘>;‘,§,1}"}'°,.
the expiration of two years from the grant of letters, apply to
the County, Circuit or Chancery Court ot'.,the county or dis- .
trict in which administration was taken out, to compel the pay
ment of his distributive share or legacy.
This and the two following sections seem to have been modiﬁed from the Act
of 1762, ch. 5, Q23. As to the jurisdiction of this subject before the Code,
sec Dougherty v. Maxwell, 6 Humph. 446. See also § 2435.

qlegalees.-The assent of the executor is necessary to perfect the title of the
legatce to a chattel bequeathed. Ross v. \Vhart0n, 10 Yerg. 190, 193; Finch v.
Rogers, 11 Humph. 559, 563 ; Chester v. Greer, 5Humph. 26,31 ; Brown v. Bibb,
§ 2 Cold. 434, -139. He only has an inchoate right to the surplus, after the pay
ment of debts. It is only a right of action, the property still remaining in the
executor. If the legatee take possession of the thing devised without the consent
of the executor, the latter may have an action of trespass against him. 2 Cold.
§ 439-40; Sneed v. Hooper, Cooke, 200, 204. ' The rule is for the protection of the
executor, who is responsible for the payment ot'_ debts to the extent of the per
sonal estate. 11 Humph. 563; 10 Yerg. 193. But this rule does not apply where
the legatee is placed in possession of the chattel by the testator in his lifetime,
and there are other assets suﬁicient for the payment of debts. 11 Humph.
§ 5'33. For the title of the legatce is derived from the will; and is not created, but

only perfecful by the assent of the executor. Ib. The will conferring an incboata
right—a right of action. 2 Cold. 489 ; Cooke, 204. And in case of a devise of
realty, vesting an inchoate right in the devises as soon as executed, which is con
clusive‘ on the death of the testator, when it relates to the date of the will. Allen

v. Hull’, 1 Yerg. 404, 408-9.

But see note to Q 2196.

Where the testator in his

life-time places the lcgatee in possession of the chattel, the executor is not charge
able with it; it is not assets in his hands; nor can he maintain any action against
the legatee for its recovery, except in the event of a deﬁciency of assets to dis
charge the debts of the estate, after having fully administered the residue of the personal estate. 11 Humph. 564. In this case it is also said that it is well estab
lished that a person appointed an executor can assent to a legacy before he proves

the will, citing generally Roper on Legacies and Williams on Executors.

But in

Martin v. Peck, 2 Yerg. 298, where this question came directly before the court,

it was held upon consideration of our statutes, prohibiting executors from enter
ing on the administration until they have procured letters testamentary, (Q 2201,)
and taken the necessary oath. (4 2221,) and given bond, (QQ 2222, 2223,) unless
excused by the will, (Q 2225,) that the assent of an executor to a speciﬁc legacy

before he proves the will and enters into bond with security, will not pass the
legal title to the lcgatce.

And this is probably the law.

See note toﬁ 2222

Where the estate is given to several in succession, the assent of the executor to
the ﬁrst taker, is an assent to the whole disposition. 11 Humph. 564. But this
assent need not be expressly proven; it may be implied from the circumstances
attending the transaction, and this as well where the legatee is executor, as where
he is not. Chester v. Greer, 5 Humph. 26, 81.
Especially where there was a great lapse of time after a settlement and divis
ion. lb. And it seems that in ease of possession by a distributee, administration,
the consent of the administrator, or whatever else was necessary to make the
holding lawful, would be presumed after a great lapse of time. Brown v. Bibby
§ 2 Cold. 434, 441. But in Martin v. Peck, 2 Yerg. 298, 299, it was held, upon
consideration of our statutes requiring the executor before delivering the legacies
to take from the legatees bond with security for the payment of any debts sub
sequently recovered or made to appear, (Q 2316 ct seq,) that the English rule that
the assent of the executor may be inferred from slight circumstances cannot pre
vail in this State; and that the evidence of assent going to defeat the creditor
should be very conelnsive.—Upon the delivery of the chattel by the executor to
the legatee, the title vests absolutely in the legatee, and a ﬁeri faciaa against the
estate of the testator cannot be levied upon it. Lyon v. Vick, 6 Yerg. 42.

Dish-ibntees.-As to who are distributees, see Q 2429 etseg.

A distinction is

drawn between distrihutees and legatees in Ross v. Wharton, 10 Yerg. 190,,

§ 193, and it is there said that the assent of the administrator is not required to
pass a distributive share. But in Sneed v. Hooper, Cooke, 200, 203~4, it is
held that neither legatees nor distributees acquire any property in the goods of
the deceased until the assent of the executor or administratoris given; and
this language is quoted and approved in Brown v. Bibb, 2 Cold. 434, 489. For
the distributee is but a statutory legatee. Martin v. Peck, 2 Yerg. 298, 299.
And the reason of the rule in case of legacies, as slated in 11 Humph. 563, and
§ 10 Yerg. 193, that it is for the protection of the executor, who is responsible for
the payment of debts to the full extent of the personal estate, applies equally to
administrators paying distributive shares. See Q 2263. And the reason given in
§ 2 Ycrg. 299, why the assent of the executor to the passing of a legacy, should
not be inferred from" slight circumstances, namely that the executor is required
to take bond and security from the legnteo before passing the legacy, (Q 2816'

at seq,) applies equally to the case of distributees.

And further, the legal title to

the decedent's property vests in the personal representative by operation of law.
McMahon v. Glassick, 5 Yerg. 304. And he can sell it absolutely and uncondi
tionally, whether the circumstances of the estate call for the sale or not. Mciklister
v. Montgomery, 3 Hayw. 94, 98 ; Johnson v. Kay, 8 Humph. 142. Or he may give
it away, or otherwise dispose of as he thinks proper. Snecd, v. Hooper, Gooke,
-200, 203; 2 Cold. 440. So completely are the assets the property of the personal
representative in legal contemplation, that claims against him in respect of the
assets and personal demands at law. Cooke, 208. And the distrihutces cannot
recover their tlist~.-ibntive shares without administration. Clark v. Clark, 3 .H|\yw
§ 28; Thurman v. Shelton, 10 Yerg. 383, 385; Puckett v. James, 2 Humph. 565,
§ 568. Nor can they compromise a suit prosecuted by the administrator, ‘without
his consent. Lewis v. Brooks, 6 Yerg. 167, 180. And if they get possession
of the int.est.:\te's goods without administration, they hold them as executors _

de son tori, and not in their own right as distributees. Brown v. Bibb, 2 Cold.
§ 434, 438-9, and citations. Sre note to § 2201. But if the administrator is
also a distributes, he is not, under all circumstances, to bring suit for a parti
tion or distribution, but he and the other distributees may agree upon and ad
just the terms of settlement among themselves. Lussctor v. Turner, 1 Yerg.
§ 418; Ross v. Wharton, 10 Yerg. 190, 194. But this cannot be done where
there are infants of tender years without guardians. 10 Yerg. 194.

“After the expiration of two 3/eara."—See Q 2295.

It seems that Q 2760 and the

construction placed upon it in Maynard v. May, 2 Cold. 44, 51, work the confusion
that while the personal representative is compelled to settle and distribute at the
expiration of two years from his qualiﬁcation, he is still liable to the suits of cred
itors for six months thereafter. See Meigs R., 75. The intention of the old law
seems to have been that the personal representative should not be compelled to
settle and distribute until the expiration ofthe time within which creditors might
sue. Trim. v. West, 9 Yerg. 438, 485; Allen v. Farrington, 2 Sneed, 526, 534.
Except incase of nou-resident creditors. Q1 2279, 2784. And those under dis
ability. Q} 2281, 2786. Executors are liable at the end of two years to pay over
to the legatecs, unless hindered from getting in the assets by some cause not to
be overcome by their industry; and when such cause exists, they must allege and

prove it. Cartwright v. Cartwright, 4 Hayw. 134.
The statute: of limitation do not bar suits for legacies or distributive shares;
because exeuctors and administrators are express trustees. Pinkerton_v. Walker,
§ 3 Hayw. 221 ; Cartwright v. Cartwright, 4 Hayw. 134; McDonald v. McDonald,
§ 8 Yerg. 145,148; Smart v. Waterhouse, 10 Yerg. 94, 104; Laﬁ‘ert_v v, Turley, 3
Sneed, 157, 170. And see Armstrong v. Campbell, 3 Ycrg. 201 ; Porter v. Porter,
§ 3 Humph. 586; Hayne v. Hall, 5 Humph. 290; Guthrie v. Owen, 10 Yerg. 389.
Unless the administrator openly denies the right of the dist:-ibutces, and assumcs
adverse ownership over the property; and then the statute begins to run from the
time such assumption of adverse ownership is made known to the distributees.
Patton v. Overton, 8 Humph. 196-7. See Q 2761, note (c). As to the time within
which legatees and distributces may sue for their portions, there seems to be no
deﬁnite rule. In Lafferty v. Turley, 3 Sneed, 174, reliefwas granted after the ex
piration of twenty-seven years. But in Smith v. Jarusgin, 1 Thompson’s Cases,
§ 135, the Supreme Court refused to disturb a division’ of slaves after a lapse of
thirty years, though the complainant at the time of the division was under dis

ability.

As to the reluctance of the Supreme Court to disturb family settlements

fairly made, after a great lapse of time, or otherwise, see Summers v. Wilson, 2
Cold. 469; Owen v. Hancock, 1 Head, 563; Williams v. Sneed, 3 Cold. 533, 542;

judgment, bill single, or note of hand shall have precedence
over unliquidated accounts, presented and ﬁled, authenticated
according to law, but all such claims shall be acted upon as
being of equal grade. [Ib., § 2.]
This section also follows the Act of 1833, ch. 36, QQ 2, 4, 6, and the Act of
§ 1837-8, ch. l1l,Q 1.
In the construction of these statutes, both as to principle and practice, the evils
intended to be remedied should be home in mind, and such construction given,
not being in violation of their fairimport and meaning, us will bcst effect the end

designed, and at the least possible expense and delay, and with as little complica
tion as the nature of the case will admit; a duo regard being had to a fair and

legal ascertainment of the justice of the claims presented by the creditors against
the estate, the proper protection of the rights of creditors, and the proper distribu.
tion of the effects among them. Reid v. Huff, 9 Humph. 345, 347. They are to
receive such a construction as will advance the remedy intended by them, and
suppress the evil.

The evil to be suppressed was the power given by law to a

vigilant and active creditor, to appropriate all the effects of an insolvent estate to
his own claim, to the exclusion of other creditor’s of equal merit, but of less raps
ciousness or astuteness ; and the remedy is, to compel s pro rata distribution in
such cases. Mosicr v. Zimmerman, 5 Humph. 62, 65 ; Rains v. Rainey, ll Humph.
§ 261, 262-3. Hence, where a person fraudulently conveyed his property and died
insolvent, and the fraudulent conveyance was set aside at the suit of one of his

creditors, the recovery was held to inure to the equal benefit of all the creditors,
allowing the creditor prosecuting the suit his necessary costs and expenses.
Rains v. Rainey, 11 Humph. 261.

But now the executor or administrator of an insolvent estate may ﬁle a bill to set asidea fraudulent conveyance of the decedent.
See Q ‘ 395.—It matters not what the form of proceeding is; in every case the
creditor collecting the fund is, under these statutes, as much a trustee for cred
itors and others interested in the estate, as is the personal representative. In no
event or form of proceeding can a creditor entitle himself to satisfaction of his
own debts, or to a priority or preference in payment, to the prejudice of the other
creditors. 11 Humph. 263-4.

Right to prefer creditors aboli.rhed.—Thelast clause of the above section, “ that
no action brought," etc., follows the exact words of the Act of 1833, ch. 36, Q 6,

§ 2d clause. In Black v. Planter’s Bank, 4 Humph. 367-8, this clause was quoted,
and it was said that the only intention of the Act of 1833 was to abolish the
preference which existed at common law, and which the Act of 1786, ch. 4, Q 2,
deﬁned and regulated. And in Mozier v. Zimmerman, 5 Humph. 62, 65, it is said
that this provision destroyed the dignity of claims as recognized by the common
law, and putjudgments, bills single, notes of hand and unsettled accounts, upon
the same footing, requiring that they shall be acted upon as of equal grade. And
see Q 2332. But the Act of 1786 has been retained in the Code in apparent con
ﬂict wilhthis opinion. {Q 2250, 2251. Query by the editors :—In view of these

The laws for the administration

of insolvent estates do not affect the statute of limitations of 1789, ch. 23, §4,
(Q 2279.) Marley v. Cummings, 5 Snced, 479, 481. Thus, where a person, four
years after the grant of administration, undertook to come in under an insolvent
hill and set up a claim to slaves belonging to the estate, it was held that he was
‘barred by this statute; and its operation was not affected by the fact that he had
delayed making his claim to await the termination of a contest on the part of
the widow who claimed the same slaves. Ib., 481-2.

§ 2378. To save the operation of the statute ot' limitations, p,m,,¢,m,,, cf
any creditor may present his claim to the clerk and master ofirlrneliliiiiy1::-Wm

clerk shall give the creditor a receipt for his claim, which pre

prescribed by law, shall prevent the operation of the statute of
limitations. [Ib., § 3-1-.]

the deceased, the devisecs, or heirs, or others interested there

This section also follows the language of the Act of 1837-8, ch. 111, Q 3. This
Act is erroneously quoted in Frazier v. Pankey, 1 Swan, 75, as chapter 3. The
heirs must be named in the bill, as Mary, Emily, ctc., and process prayed against
them. The appointment of a guardian ad litem, and an answer by him will not
make them parties ; and in such a case the proceedings are void. 1 Swan, 75-79.

He can, after staying by injunction the prosecution of all suits at lew,.so modify
his injunction as ‘to permit a particular suit to proceed. Dibbrcll v. Williams, 3

notice or citation shall be issued to the persons to whom the
distribution was made, and their sureties, if any; and, upon
sucli notice or citation being served, or upon publication being
made according to the rules of proceeding in chaneery, the

court shall proceed to decree whatever is just and equitable.
[Ib.]
§ 2394. In no case, where an estate is ascertained to be in
no personally

responsible solvent, shdl any executor or administrator be rendered per
sonally responsible hy reason of any false plea by him pleaded.

[Ib., § 46.]
This provision also follows the Act of 1837-8, ch. 111, Q 5.
By the common law, a judgment by default against an administrator, or ajudg

ment against him upon afalse plea by him pleaded, was an admission of assets to
the extent ot‘ the recovery, such as would charge him (le bani; propriis for a de
vastavit. Mozier v. Zimmerman, 5 Humph. 62-3. As where the issue oi‘ “fully
administered," “no assets," or “not suﬂicient assets ” is found against him.
Q 2263. But it seems that since these insolvent laws, a judgment by default
against the personal representative does not have the effect to charge him per
sonally. 5 Humph. 63, 65. At least after ﬁling insolvent bill and obtaining
injunction. Ib., 65-6. And if the ﬁling ofabill suggesting insolvency does not
have the etfect to suspend, ea inslanli, and by mere operation of law and the act
of ﬁling the bill, all further progress in suits pending against the personal repre
sentative, it at least makes any future decree or judgment against him individually
and dc bonispropriis, erroneous. Dance v. McGrcgor, 5 Humph. 428, 435. But
an administrator cannot, after the lapse of six years from the grant of administra
tion, during which time he has permitted judgments to go against him without
defence, and paid debts to the extent ofthc assets, ﬁle s. bill suggesting the insol
vency of the estate, and obtain an injunction againstjudgments which are about
to be rendered against him dz‘ bonis propriis. Hamilton v. Newman, 10 Humph.
§ 557. See Q 2332 and note.

!nudu1entcnn- 2395. The executor or administrator may, as the represent
mwd~=ative of the creditors of an insolvent estate, ﬁle a bill to set
aside a fraudulent conveyance of property ; and when such

veyunce. bill to;

conveyance is set aside, the assets recovered shall be distrib
uted pro rata among the creditors.

[Ib., § 48.]

By the common law and our statute of frauds, Q 1759,) personal representa
tives are estopped to impeach the transactions of their testators or intestutes for
fraud. Lassitcr v. Cole, 8 Humph. 621, 623; note to Q 1759. And the insolvent
acts of 1883, ch. 36, and 1837-8, ch. 111, did not alter the law in this respect. 8

Humph. 623. Nor does the above section, except as to insolvent estates. Boxy
v. McKay, 4 Sneed, 286, 288-9. The personal representative proceeding, under this
section, must allege the insolvency of the estate, that it has been suggested, that
there are bona ﬁde debts against the estate, and that the proceeding is for and on
behalf of creditors. 4 Sneed, 289.
§ 2396. In all suits by the executor or administrator of any deceased person, the insolvency of whose estate has been sug

“W"u10w."-A woman divorced in another State, under the law of which her
subsequent mznriage is prohibited, and marrying again in this State, is lawfully married here, and entitled to dower.

Diokson v. Dickson, 1 Yerg. 110.—A post7~

nuptial contract of separation and settlement, by which the wife takes certainprop
erty in lieu of all claims against the husband's estate, does not extinguish her

right of dower ; but upon the death of her husband she must elect whether she will"
abide by the settlement or take her dowcr. Watkins v. \Vatkins, 7 Yerg. 283, 292 ;
Parham v. Parham, 6 Humph. 287, 296. And so in case of an agrcementintended
as a marriage settlement, unless the husband etfectually executes it in his lifetime,
the widow may elect to enforce it in equity, or abandon it, and claim her legal

rights by dissenting from the will.

“ Landa.”—The original Act rend “ lands, tenementsand hereditaments.”

These

terms did not include a. right of pre-emption and occupancy south of the French
Broad and Holston rivers, and a widow was not dowable of such an interest. Tip
ton v. Davis, 5 Hayw. 279. Nor was she dowable of an entry, or of a land warrant ;
these interest not having grown into a legal title by grant. 5 Hayw. 279. But
this was before the Act of 1823, above quoted, extending the right of dower to

equitable estates.

See 3 Hayw. 62, 68.

See also Scott v. Price, 2 Head, 532,

" Seizal anzlposae.md."--Legal seizin in the sense of the common law is here

Where the husband was equitable owner of land charged with

the payment of the purchase money, the widow cannot have dower assigned out of
it without a discharge of the sum charged on the estate. Thompson v. Cochran,
§ 7 Humph. 72. In such a case she is entitled to have the land sold to pay the
debt, and to be endowed of one-third of the surplus. lb. 74-5 ; Williams v.
Woods, 1 Humph. 408, 411, 414. And the purchaser takes the land discharged
from the right of dower. Ib.—Where the husband, who was guardian, purchased
land with the money of his wards, taking the title in his own name, his widow
was not dowable of such land. Gannaway v. Tnrpley, 1 Cold. 572, 680-81. But
if the land were purchased in part with the husband’s own money, the widow
would be dowuble out of any surplus that might remain after sale and satisfaction
rendered to the wards. lb. Tarplcy v. Gannaway, 2 Cold. 246, 250.

§ 2399. She shall also be entitled to dower in lands mortgag-mmmss

ed, or conveyed in trust to pay debts, when the husband dies estates.
before foreclosure of the inortgagc, or sale under the deed.
[Act 1855-6, ch. 57.]
Previorur to this Act, dower was postponed to the satisfaction of a mortgage or
deed of trust, and the widow was dowablc out of the surplus. Tarpley v. Gonna
vmy, 2 Cold. 246, 249; Chester v. ‘Greer, 5 Humph. 26, 29; Mclvcr v. Cherry, 8
Humph. 713. But on abill to foreclose, the widow of the deceased mortgagor
was not a necessary party. Mims v Mims, 1 Humph. 425, 430. But where land
was charged by deed of trust with the payment of a sum of money, and the in
cumbrancer subsequently became liable as endorser for other moneys, borrowed
and used to pay oil‘ part of the incumbrnnccs, this was held to be no charge
against the wid0w’s dower. Her dowcr was postponed only to the payment of so
much of the original debt secured by the deed of trust, as remained unpaid. Greer

v. Chester, 7 Humph. 77.
But under this Act, whore the husband executes a deed of trust and dies before
a sale has taken place under it, the widow is entitled to have dower speciﬁcally as.
signed to her out of the lands conveyed. She is not postponed to dower out of
the surplus after sale. Tarpley v. Gannaway, 2 Cold. 246. Otherwise, where
the conveyance in trust was executed before the marriage. In such a case, this act does not apply. Boyer v. Boyer, 1 Cold. 12. But iii such acase the widow
is entitled to dower out of the surplus after satisfaction of the debt for which the
land is bound. Ib., 14.
Duration of

§ 2400. This third part shall be, and inure to her own proper
use, beneﬁt, and belioof, for and during the tei-in of her natu
ral life. [Act 1784, ch. 22, § 8.]
Under tlicso statutes, the widow cannot be invested with a portion of the real
estate in fee simple in lieu of dower. Simpson v. Alexander, 6 Cold. 619, 627-8.
Whether a court of Chancery under its general powers could do so, query. Ib.
§ 829. But equity will under certain circumstances, decree pecuniary compensation
in lien of dower; as where an innocent purchaser erected valuable improvements
upon the property. Lewis v. James, B Humpli. 537, 540. The right of dower in
heres in the fee which passes to the heirs on the death of the ancestor. Car
michael v. Csrmichael, 5 Humpli. 96, 98 ; Mims v. Minis, 1 Humph. 425, 430.
And is not adverse to the fee. Chairs v. Hobson, 10 Humph_ 354. Hence what
ever operates to bar the title of the heirs is a bar to the right of dower; as the
statute of limitations. 5 Humph. 98. See note to Q 2411. And a conveyance

by the heirs of a tract out of which dower has been assigned, without excluding
the dower interest, is not champterous.

Ross v. Blair, Meigs, 625.

The widow has no estate in the lands until dower assigned, the undivided seizin
remaining in the heirs. They alone can bring suits to recover possession, and for
injuries done to the estate. Thompson v. Stacy, 10 Yerg. 493-4. If, then, she
cannot be a party plaiiitiﬁ‘, she need not be a party defendant; and this principle
applies as well to suits in equity, concerning equitable rights, as it does to suits at
law. Hims v. Mims,10 Humph. 425, 430. Hence, on a bill to forclose a mortgage
atterthe death of the mortgagor, his widow was not a necessary party. Ib. But
this was before the Act of 1855, (Q 2399.) Nor is she :1. necessary party where a,

vendee procures land to be sold in satisfaction of his lien.
§ 1 Humph. 408, 414.

Williams v. Woods,

Whatever rights she may have may always be enforced

against the tenant of the freehold, if it be to the land itself‘; or, against the trustees
of the fund, if it be to a portion of money received for lands of which she would
have been endowable, had they remained in kind. 1 Humph. 480-31. But after
the assignment of dower the widow is seized of a freehold estate in the portion al
lotted to her. She is subject to the charges, duties and services, to which the estate
would be properly liable, such as taxes, charges for building pavements in a town.
etc. Whyte v. Mayor, 2 Swan, 364, 369-—The assignment of dower so far defeats
the seizin of the heirs, that the husband of one of the heirs, who dies during the
life of hcr mother, the dowress, will not be let in as tenant by the courtesy to his.
wife‘s remainder interest. Reed v. Reed, 3 Head, 491.
Dwelling
iiouse included

in dower.

§ 2401. And in said third part shall be comprehended the
dwelliiig-house in which the husband was accustomed most
generally to dwell next before his death, commonly called the
mansion house, unless the widow agree that it shall not be
included, together with the oﬂices, out-houses, buildings, and
other improvements tliereiinto belonging or appertaining.
[Ib.]
Reason and purpose of this provision. Vincent v. Vincent, 1 lleisk. 833, 338
§ 40. In estimating the dower the value of the mansion and other buildings as
signed, is not to be taken into account.
§ 2402. But if it appear to the court assigning the dO“r'e1',Exggpﬂ°|1,
that the whole of said dwelling-house, out-houses, oﬁiccs and
appurtenances cannot be applied to her use without manifest
injustice to the children or other relations, then such part or
portion thereof as the court shall conceive will be suﬂicient
to afford her a decent residence, due regard being had to her
condition and past manner of life, shall be assigned to her.
[Ib.]
§ 2403. In assigning the widow her dower, the commission-mrd pm,
ers sh-all not be compelled to assign her a third part of eaehh°' '”"'M'
separate tract of land, where there are more tracts than one,
but may make the assignment, according to quality and quan

tity, in such manner as will give her one-third in value of the
whole estate.
“ One-third in value.”—That is,—unless in exceptional cases-—exclusive of the
value of the mansion house and other buildings assigned her under Q 2401. Vin

cent v. Vincent, 1 Heisk. 333, 337-40.

She is also entitled to a ramble portion

of the timber lands, suﬂicient to support the tract assigned her.

Ib., 340-41.

§ 2404. A widow may dissent from her hnsband’s \\'ill— Dissent from]

is not made for her; in which case, she shall- signify her dis

will.
§ 2. Where a provision, in personal estate, is made for her,
but the whole of the hnshand’s property, including the be
quest, is taken for the payment of his debts; in which ease
without any formal dissent, she may sue for her dower.
[Act 1845-6, ch. 214.]
And in both cases, she shall be endowed as if her husband
had died intestate. [Act 1784, ch. 22, § 8 ; 18-1 5-6, ch. 244.]
Before the Act of 1784, a widow was not put to her election between a testa
mentary provision and her (lower, unless such provision were made expressly, or
by necessary implication, in bar or satisfaction of her dower. Reid v. Campbell,
Meigs, 378, 388; Malone v. Majors, 8 Humph. 577, 580; Demoss v. Demoss,7
Cold. 256, 258. And she might take both her dower and the bequest. 8 Hnmph.
§ 580; 7 Cold. 258. But by the Act of 1784, any provision for the wife in the
husband's will, either out of real or personal estate, put her to her election,
which she was compelled to make within six months after the probate of the

will; otherwise she was bound by its provisions.

Meigs, 888, citing Craven v.

Craven, 4 Dev. Eq. 338. And if she did not dissent within the time limited, she
took only what the will gave her, "and could not afterwards claim the beneﬁt of
any dower or distribution out of property as to which her husband may have
died intestate. 8 Humph.679-80; McClung v. Sneed, 8 Head, 218, 223-4. And

vice rersa if she dissented from the will she took nothing under it.
v. Park, 9 Humph. 195, 202-3.

Armstrong

This doctrine, as the construction of the Act of 1784, was established by a long line of judicial decisions.

§ 7 Cold. 258, 261.

And was stated to be the law under this section of the Code in Waddcll V. Terry,
§ 4 Cold. 51, 54-5.

But the case ot'Demoss v. Dcmoss, holds that this section and

Q 2429 arc to be construed together in par-i nzateria, and as parts of the same
statutes. 7 Cold. 250. That construed together they do not place the widow in
respect of her dower and distributive portion, in tho same situation in which she
was placed by the Act of 1784. Ib., 259, at seq. That the Act of 1784 applied
to cases oflolaliutcstacy alone, while Q 2429 embraces both cases of total and of

partial intestacy; and that the rights of the widow under that section depend
upon the status of the property, and whether her husband died intestate as to it.
Ib., 264. That this construction is rendered unavoidable by the language em
ployed iné 2429, and which does not occur in the Act of1784, namely, “ The per
sonal estate as to which any person dies intestate;" etc, and that it was thein
tcntion oftho Legislature in employing this langucge to restore the rule in cases
of partial intestacy, as it existed prior to the Act of 1874. Ib., 265. And
hence, that where the widow accepts the provisions of her husband’s will within
the time limited, she is nevertheless cntitlcd to her distributive share undcrﬂ
§ 2429, out ofany property as to which he may have died intestate; and that the
contrary language in Waddcll v. Terry was a mere dictum.
“Endowcd," ctc.—-The word “ endow ” as here uscd, docs not moan simply the
assignment of dower out of realty; hut extends to the personal estate, so as to
allow the widow to participate in that, according to the section for the distribution
of the estate of intcstates, Q 2-129. Gupton v. Gupton, 3 Head, 488; recognized
in Dcmoas v. Demoss. 7 Cold 256, 262. And for the construction of the word
“ dower" in a will, see Paine v. Gupton, 11 Humph. 402. ‘From the cases of
Watkiiis v. Dean, 10 Yerg. 321, 327, and Turner v. Fisher, 4 Sneed, 209, decided
before the Code, it would seem that a widow dissenting from her ln1sband’s will
is merely let into tho distributive share that she would have received under the
Act of17S4, that is,.ifthcre wcro no child, or not more than two, to one-third, and
ii‘ there were more than two children, to a child’s part. But Mr" King thinks
that the rule in \Vatkins v. Dean is not now the law, and bases this conclusion on

the supposition that the Act of 1827, ch. 14, which received construction in that
case is not curried into the Code.

But this is a mistake: the Act of 1827, ch. 14,

which gave the widow but. half the personal estate, in case there were no children
or deccndnnts of children, as enlarged by the Act of 18434, ch. 211, (the Act un
der consideration in Turner v. Fishcr,) which gives the widow in such a case, all
the personal estate, appears in the Code at§ 2-129, sub-sec 2. But now sce§
§ 2429 a; and see Armstrong v. Park 9 Humph. 195, 202-3, where it is held that the
dissent of the widow opens the whole estate so far as she is concerned, and lets
her into the enjoyment of all her rights thereto, in as ample a manner as if her
husband had died wholly intestate. In such a case the speciﬁc legacies fall back
and become a part of the corpus, of the estate, to be taken into consideration in
connection with all other legacies and personal estate, out of which she is en
. titled to her distributive share. 9 Humph. 203.

Fraud; mi-n‘akc.—I!' the Widow is prevented from dissenting within the time
limited by the statute by the fraud of those interested in the estate, she may as
sert her rights in equity as though she had dissented in time. Smart v. Water

house, 10 Yerg. 94; recognized in McDaniel v. Douglas, 6 Humph. 220, 229.
And in such n case she being remitted to her rights under the will, and the ex
ecutor or administrator being an express trustee, the statute of limitations does

not operate against her. 10 Yerg. 104. And if it did, it would not begin to run
until the discovery ofthe fraud. Ib., 195. See note to <3, 2812, last paragraph;
note (0) to 1 2761 ; note to Q 2-t1l.—But where the failure of the widow to dissent within the time limited grew out of a mistake on her part as to the condition
=of the estate, or the adequacy of the provisions made in the will for her support,

she is entitled to relief in equity. McDaniel v. Douglas, 6 Humpli. 220, 229.
“ Within. one year after the probate,” elc.—This means the probate in common
jorm, (5 2171,) and not the probate in solemn form, which takes the place in
the Circuit Court upon an issue of devisavit vrl non, ( {Q 2172, 2178 et seq.) Harry

[Act 1859-60, ch. 3, § 1.]
Passed November 3, 1859, and took effect from its passage.
The above section simply re-enacts th e last clause of section 8 of the Act of

§ 1784, ch. 22, which was omitted from the Code at Q 2404. Under the Code, a wid
ow dissenting from her husband’s will took the full distributive portion to which
she would have been entitled in case of his dying intestate. Gupton v. Gupton,
§ 3 Head, 488. And the above Act, as stated in 8 Head 491, was designed to
remedy the strong case of a husband dying without children, or descendants of
children, in which case the widow ‘dissenting would have been entitled to the cu
tire personal cstate(2-129, sub-sec, '2.) Before the Code, a widow dissenting
from her husband’s will, took only the distributive ‘are to which she would have
been entitled under the Act of 1784; and the above Act re-establishes the law as it
was then. Sec Watkins v. Dean, and Turner v. Fisher, cited under preceding
~section.—The above Act applies by its terms only to s ease of dissent from the
husband's will. 7 Cold, 263.

§ 2405. And to enable a widow to act as her interest may  require, the executor or administrator shall disclose to her, Eiiiigigabio
upon her application,
the state and condition
of her liusband’sw ld0 w.

-estate within said period.

[Act 1851-2, ch, 79, § 2.]

And if she is prevented from dissenting within the time limited, through the
fraud or misrepresentation of the executor, as to the condition of the estate, she
-can enforce in equity her legal rights as fully as though she had dissented in time.

§ 93406. Any conveyances made fraudulently to children or Conveyance to

-others, with an intent to defeat the widow of her dower, shall 33$?‘ do":

made. [Act 1784, ch. 22, § 8.]
'
The intent to defraud the widow of hcr dower, is the circumstance that makes
conveyance void. liclntosh v. Ladd, 1 Humpli. 459, 465; Hughes v. Shaw,
Hart 8:. Yerg. 323, 326 ; Brewer v. Connell 11 Humph. 500. And it seems that
-circumstances which prove that the conveyance was intended to defraud credi_
-tors, may also go to show that it was in fraud of dower. Hughes v. Shaw, Mart.

I the
How far the defence of being a purchaser for u valuable con- -

sidcration is available against the wido\v‘s claim for dower. lb. 328. A eon
vcyance made with intent to defraud the widow of her dower, is void, although a fair price may have been paid, if the eonveyee participated in the fraudulent in
tent. Brewer v. Connell, 11 Humph. 500. In Hughes v. Shaw, above quoted, the '
court argue, but do' not decide, that a conveyance by the husband, founded ‘
merely upon a meritorious consideration, is fraudulent and void against dower,
as much as though the intent to defraud the widow of her dowcr were established
by proof. But this question is expressly resolved in the negative by McIntosh v.
Ladd, 1 Humph. 459, and Reynolds v. Vance, l Heisk 344. These cases, follow

ing Littletou v. Littleton. 1 Dev. & Bat. 330, state the principle to be that bona
ﬁde conveyances, that is to say such as are not intended to defraud the widow,—us
sales, to make which power is allowed the husband ; and bonaﬁde gifts, whereby
the husband actually and npenl_v divests himself of his properly and the enjoy
ments of it in his life-time in favor of children and others, thereby making ac,
cording to his circumstances and the situation of his family, ajust and reas0n- »
able provision for persons having meritorious claims upon him, and with that view,
and not with the view to defeat, nor for the sake of diminishing the widow's dow
cr,—-are neither within the meaning nor the words of the Act. lHumph. 466;
§ 1 Hcisk. 845-8, 349. A conveyance in fraud of dower is void only as to the
right of dowcr, anl cannot be set aside at the suit of the heirs. Rowland v. Row
land, 2 Snccd, 543. The provision of the statute does not extend to personalty,
so as to make a conveyance fraudulent es against the widow's distributive share.
She cannot question any disposition of his property, which her husband may
have made. Richards v. Richards, ll Humph. 429. She cannot even have ad
vancements collated for her beneﬁt. Ib. See § 2432 ct -seq.

The intent to dqfeat dowcr must appear from the facts and circumstances. Vincent .

It would seem that this and the following section, in compiling the Code, should

have precceded Q 2408. Eds.
Rmwdy for dower.—1n Tennessee we have no writ of dower, nude niltil habet,
other writ of right, nor any remedy on the subject of dower, except the summary
one given by the statute of 1781, ch. 22,[which the above modiﬁes,] not adapted to
taking an account or ascertaining damages; and the remedy by bill in equity (Q

§ 2407.) London v. London, 1 Humph. 1,12. If in Chancery, the Chancellor,
may, in certain cases, call in the aid ofajury, and in others direct nn action to be
brought at law; but he is not thereby precluded from assigning the dower, and

taking all proper accounts between the parties. Ib., 13.

And if he calls in the nid

of a. jury, the verdict is not conclusive upon him. Ib., 13-14. This case overrules,
so far as it conﬂicts with the rule here established, the general observations in.
Thompson v. Stacy, us stated in the reporter's note as follows: “ 1st. That under
the statute of 1784, authorizing the widow to ﬁle her petition in the County Court
or Circuit Court, if the right if dower is disputed, a jury must be impannelled to try it, and the damages are to be assessed by the jury. 2d. If, upon apetition
ﬁled under said statute, the widow's right to dower is not disputed, and she claims

damages which are not admitted, a writ of inquiry must be awarded to ascertain
them. And, 8d. If the widow’s dower be assigned niider the provisions of that
Act, and no damages be assessed or given to her in the proceeding, her right to

recover damages is forever gone.
Rent: and proﬁts.--The dowress is entitled to an account of rents and proﬁts
during tho time her dowry has been wrongfully withheld. Walker v. Walker, 6
Cold. 671, 581 ; London v. London, 1 Humph. 1,9. tobe ascertained, if in Chan
cery, by an uceonnt. 1 Humph. 9. If at law by a writ of inquiry. Thompson v.
Stacy, 1OYerg. 493, 498. But she cannot maintain an action for use and occupa
tion against a tenant from year to year, for rents which accrued after the death of

her husband, and before the assignment of her dower, although no damages were
given her when the dower was assigned. 10 Yerg. 493, 499; recognized and ap
proved in 1 Humph. 18.

Statutory remedy mint bepui-suerl.—At common law tlielieir was bound to assign
dower; but now unless the widow proceeds to have her dower set apart in the
statutory manner; the heir may recover the mansion house and land adjoining in

ejcctmcnt. Tool v. Pride. 1 Tenn. 234.
Estopptl.—Tl'l0 acceptance of dower est-ops the widow from afterwards disputing
her husband’s title to the land out of which she is endowed. Perry v. Calhoun. 8

ch. 22, Q 2, “ any right,title or interest in and to any estate or inheritance of land,or
other real estate in fee simple. " It will be seen that this language is not retained

in the statutes of descent as condensed in this article of the Code; but by Q 51,
anle, the word “ land,” wherever used in the Code, includes “ lands, tenements
and heredimments, and all rights thereto and interests therein, equitable as well
aslegal.” Every interest of a fee simple character pa seed, by the original acts,
whether they were or were not of inheritance by the common law. Campbell v.

ruling the dictum in Campbell v. Taul, 8 Yerg. 66!, the Act of 1784, ch. 22, Q 2,

Where laud is sold in chaneery for partition, if one of the tenants in common,
‘oeing a fa-me covert, die before coniirtnation of the sale, her share descends, to her

conﬁrmation, is an absolute conversion of the realty into personalty. Moore
aparie, 3 Head, 371 ; Jones v. Walknp, 5 Sneed, 135. And where the land of
an infant is sold, if the infant dies after sale, and before the court has made any
order stamping the fund as realty, it goes to his administrator, and not to his

in the Act of 1784, ch. 22, Q 7, as amended by 1784, 2d. Sess., ch. 10,@ 3. See

and 1841-2, ch. 171, Q 1 ; the effect of which is exhibitedin Meigs’ Degist, Descenla,
Second, Third and Fourth Hypotheses. These acts, as above quoted, previous to
that of 1841-2, received construction in Butler v. King, 2 Yerg. 115, and Hay
wood v. Moore, 5 Humph. 684.
(a) The words “gift,” “ devise," “descent,” are not technical, and are differ

ent in their meaning from the common law terms “descent" and “ purchase."
Beaumont v. Irvvin, 2 Sneed. 291, 302. Neither were the words “ derived" and
“ purchased, ” as used in the old acts technical. Haywood, v. Moore, 2 Humph.
§ 584, 588; Roberts v. Jackson, 4 Yerg. 308, 822-3. An estate derived by descent
from the uncle of the mother, is not within this paragraph. In such a case, a.

child dying intestate, unmarried and without brothers or sisters, her father takes
in preference to her heirs on the part of her mother.

§ 1 Heisk. 511, 513.

Penniman v. Francisco,

(b) The wording of this clause follows the language of the Court in Nesbit v.
Brian, 1 Swan, 468, 471, construing the orignal statute. YVhere a child inherited
real estate from his father, and died leaving no issue, brothers or sisters, his

paternal uncle and aunt took in preference to his maternal brothers and sisters
of the half blood, issue of his mother by a marriage subsequent to the death of
his father. Ib.

(c) Thus, where land came by descent from the father, and the owner died
without issue, brothers or sisters, it went to the brothers and sisters of the father
to the exclusion of those of the mother. Beaumont v. Irwin, 2 Sneed, 291,
The paternal uncle and aunt succeed to the real estate of an intestate, inherited from his paternal ancestor, in preference to the maternal grandmother. Lati

QJQ3. When an illegitimate child dies intestate without
child or children, husband or wife, his real and personal estate
shall go to his mother; and if there be no motherliving, then
equally to his brothers and sisters by his mother or descendants
of such brothers and sisters.
The rules of descent of the proceeding sections are applicable to the estates of
persons of legitimate birth, dying intestate. Webb v. Webb, 1 Head, 68, 70.
This section applies alone to the case of illegetimate decedents, and only changes
the law of descents and distributions in relation to their estates. Woodward v.
Duncan, l Cold. 562, 564. But as to the estate of a legitimate, his illegitimate
half brothers cannot inherit it. Ib. Under this section the mother cannot take, except in the event of the intestate’s dying without either “child or children, hus
band or wife." The course of descent in such a case is ﬁrst, to the child or chil

natural born child or children, whether she also leave st leg
itimate child or children, or otlierwise, such natural born child

or children shall take, by the general rules of descent and
distribution, equally with the other child or children, the

By the common lamillegitimate brothers or sisters could notinherit from a legiti

inherituhle blood, and could not inherit any estate, no matter from whom descend

ofinheritable blood. Riley v. Byrd, 1 Head, 20, 21. The Act of 1819, ch. 18, Q
§ 1. modiﬁed this principle so far as to make an illegitimate child the heir and dis
tributee of his mother, in case there were no legitimate children. Brown v. Kirby‘
§ 9 Humph. 460, 463, quoting the statute. Under this statute, a base born child
could inherit no estate, real or personal, from any relative of his mother, lineal or
collateral. 9 Humph. 468. This statute was omitted from the Code, except the
last clause, re-enacted by the Act of 1851-2 ch. 39, (Q. 2423,) which allows the brothers and sisters of an illegitimate totake from him in case of his death intestate
without child ; but its provisions are re~enscted and extended by the above sec
tion.

“ His or Im- brothers and sisters,” etc.—This clause follows the Act of i819.
Its meaning is not restricted to illegitimate brothers and sisters of the illegitimate,
but it includes all brothers and sisters without rqard to their legitimacy.

equally.
[lb.]
“ Ant owhich any person dies intestate."-—Tl1e old statutes of di~:t.i-ibrition applied
to cases of partial intestacy. Pearce v. Gleavcs, 10 Ycrg. 359. And so does the
shove section. Demoss v. Demoss, 7 Cold. 256, 265. But the Act of 1784, ch.

§ 22, Q 2, prescribing a \vido\v’s distributive portion where she dissented from her
husband's will, did not apply to cases of partial intestacy. 7 Cold. 264. See
Dower, § 2404 and note, and Q 2404 a and note; Advancements, Q 2432, and note.
(a) And children born out of wedlock, legitimutcd by the Act of 1805, ch. 2,

§ 3640, 3641,) are entitled to take in the distribution, share and share alike
with the widow oftheir putative father. Swanson v. Swanson, 2 Swan, -H6 ; § 8642.
And the whole blood and half blood take equally; and there ‘is no luw giving
preference to the hall‘ blood on the side of the transmitting ancestor to the ex
clusion of the other line, [as in case of realty, Q 2420, sub~sec 3.] Kyle v. Moore,
§ 3 Sneed, 183....
(Ir) A similar rule applies Ill descents. Q 2422.—-The original Act of 1843-4
read “ I1-yilinaale children.” etc. The word “legitimate” was n mere expletive ;

since illegitimate persons had no right of inheritence and succession, either by
the common law or by statute. It gave the widow no right to the exclusion of
the legitimatcd children of her deceased husband. Swanson v. Swanson, 2 Swan,
H6, 452.—See Demoss v. Demoss. 7 Cold. 256, where a widow accepted the pro»
visions of her husbnud‘s will and under this clause received all the pcrsonalty as

to which he died intestate.
(c) That is, a child dying intestate, unmarried and without issue, his father
is his sole distributee. Dendrick v. Armour, 10 Humph. 588, 697-8 ; Gardenhire v.
Hinds, 1 Head, 402, 410. And takes whatever estate the son had in personalty

whether legal or equitable, although there are other children surviving.

Bragg

v. French, 5 Sneed, 2-H, 247.
(J) Thus, a person dying intestate, [unmurried,] and without issue, his
mother, step-father, brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood surviving
him, his personalty goes to his mother and brothers and sisters of the whole and
half blood, share and share alike, the step-father being entitled to the mothcr’s
share ; but his real estate goes to his brothers and sisters on the side of the trans
mitting aneestor, [ as in Q 2420, sub-sec. 3.] Dendrick v. Armour, 10 Hurnph.

§ 588, 597-8.
(e) Both of the whole and halfblood, and without reference to the line of the
transmitting ancestors as in Kyle v. Moore, 3 Sneed, 183.
(f) A child dying intestate [umnnn-ied, without issue,] leaving neither father nor mother, brother nor sister, [or their children,] his maternal grandmother
succeeds to his personalty as next of kin, in preference tu his paternal uncle and
aimt. Latimcr v. Rogers, 3 Head, 692.
Nat ofkin.--rule of computation.—Who are next of kin, is to be ascertained by
the civil law rule of computation. Kyle v. Moore. 3 Sneed, 183-4. This mode, as to collaterals, is to count the degrees from the deceased up to the common
parent or ancestor, and down to the relations in question. lb. 184-5. The
father is iu the ﬁrst degree, and so is the mother; and the children of each are in
the second degree. Ib., 185. Where there is more than one in equal degree, they
take equally. lb. The hall‘ blood on the side of the father, and those on the side
of the mother are in equal degree. lb.
As to when realty is converted into personalty by judicial sale, so that the pro
coeds go to the personal representative instead of the heirs, see note to { 2420,

Oollaterals.

§ 2430. There is no representation among collaterals, after
brothers’ and sisters’ children. [Act 1766, ch. 3, § 3.]
Hence, a grand niece does not take any share in the distribution ofan intes
tate‘s personalty, where there are brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces.
Penniman v. Francisco, l llcisk. 511-12.
§ 2432. All advancements, whether by settlement or other
wise, in the lifetime of the deceased, or by testamentary pro
vision, shall be collated and brought into contribution in the
partition and distribution of the real and personal estate of

the deceased; those in real estate, ﬁrst in the partition of
real estate, and those in personal estate in the distribution of

the personal estate. [Act 1839-40, ch. 48, § 1; 1829, ch. 36, § 1.]
“ Advaneemenls".—An advancement is a gift by a parent to a child, by antici
pation, in whole or in part, of what it is supposed the child will be entitled to on
the death of the parent. Cawthon v. Coppcdge, 1 Swan, 487; House v. \Voodard,
§ 5 Cold. I96, 200. A gift to grand children of chattels, with a. reservation of use
to a daughter for life, is an advancement. 1 Swan, 487. But the rent of land on
which a son was placed by his father for the use of the son and his children, the land
itself not having been given to the son for fear he should waste it, must be account
ed for by the son as an advancement. Robinson v. Robinson, 4 Humph. 392-3,
But rents accrued since the ancestor’s death are not to be thus accounted for
As to them, the son is liable to the new owners, the heirs. Ib. A chattel given
by will to n father upon his promise to give it to his son, which he did, and then
died intestate, was an advancement to the son. Shaw v. Shaw, 6 Ilumph. 418.
If a father pays a debt for a son, or advances money to him, this is presumed, in the absence of proof, to be an advancement. Johnson v. Hoyle, 8 Head, 57, 59.
But if he takes and holds the notes of the son, it is a debt, and not an advance

ment, unless there is proof showing that he did not intend to collect them. Vadcn
v. Hancc, 1 Head, 300.

And where a father sold his slaves to the highest bidders

at public outcry, and his sous became purchasers, and executed their notes for
the purchase money, which the father held until his death, and which then passed
into the hands of his administrator, this was not u case of ndvancement; and
the declarations of the old man that he never intended to collect. the notes
“ amounted to nothing," since he reserved the right to collect them, if his necessi
ties required. House v. Woodard, 5 Cold. 196, 201. Where the purchaser at
sheriffs sale assigned his interest in the land to the daughter of thejudgment
debtor with his assent and direction, and the judgment debtor failed to redeem»
this was an ndvancement by the judgment debtor to his daughter. McCoy v.
Pearce, 1 'I'hompson’s Cases, 145. And where the father paid the purchnso
money for land, and had the bond for title made to himself and his son jointly,
this was an advancement of an undivided moiety of the equitable title to the son.

Thompson v. Thompson, 1 Yerg. 97, 99.

And when the father advances the

purchase money and tukcs the conveyance in the name of his infant child, no
trust results: it is deemed an advancement for the child, if the child is not
advanced. l Yerg. 99; Hamilton v. Bradley, 5 Hayw. 127, 137 ; Dudley v. Bos

worth, 10 Humph. 9, 13.
“ By settlcnu-nl,"etc—Under the old law, 1784. ch. 22, Q 2, which related to des
rcnia, and which used the word “ settled,” but omitted the expression “in his life

time," it was held that a devise was asetllement, and before children could have par
tition of lands acquired subsequent to the will, they must bring into hotchpot the
lands devised to them. Vance v. lluling, 1 Yerg. 33 ;Sturdevant v. Goodrich,
§ 3 Yerg. 95; recognized in Pearce v. Glenves, 10 Ycrg. 359-60. But in the Act of

§ 1766, ch. 3, which was a statute of distributions, the words “ in his life-time "
were used; and it was hence held that in cases ofpartial intestacy, the devises
or bequests in the will of either real or personal estate were not under that act
advaneements made in the life-time of the testator, and were not, therefore, to be

brought into contribution in the distribution of the unbequeathed personal estate.
Pearce v. Gleaves, 10 Yerg. 359, 360-61. And in Vance v. Huling it was in
timated that s clear intention expressed in the will would control the equality

provided for by the Act of 1784. 2 Yerg. 137.—But now since the Act of 1839
§ 40, ch. 48, Q 1, which the above section substantially follows, and which, as was
said in 4 Sneed, 249, “ is too clear to admit of comment,” if the tcstatnr die in
testate as to any part ofhis estate, and tho distributes wish to share in the same,
they must bring into contribution the advancements made to them by the testator,
either in his life-time or by testamentary provision. Perry v. High, 3 Head, 349;
Gold v. Vaughn, 4 Sneed, 245, 249.

Widow may not collate.—-Although a widow is dowable out of realty advanced
to children with "intent to defeat her right of dower. (supra, Q 2406,) yet she
takes as distributcc only her appropriate share of the personalty which the hus
band leaves at his death: she cannot have advancements collated for her beneﬁt_

Passed January 25, 1871, and took effect from its passage

The whole body oi‘ the common huv on the subject of the domestic relations,
and especially the relation of baron and fame, except so fur-as changed by

statute, has been adopted among us. ll1cCorry v. King, 8 Humph. 267, 273.
But the common law mode of constituting a. marriage, namely, by consent and

cohabitation is of no validity in this State, and has not been since the time when
the colonial legislature took up the subject and legislated upon it, at least since
§ 1741; and proof of such a. marriage is no defence to a presentment for lewd
ncss. Grisham v. State, 2 Yerg. 689, 592; Act of1741, ch.1. Our statutes

entirely supersede mid exclude the common law mode of sohnuizing or consti
tuting a marriage; so much so that n niarriuge solemnized. by n justice of the
peace, out of his county, the parties not having license, is void, although fol

lowed by subsequent cohabitation; and it future marriage during the existence of
the relation thus formed is not bignmy. Bashaw v. State, 1 Yerg. 177. See
the Act of 1829, which was contemporaneous with this decision, and which deﬁnes
and punishes bigamy and prescribes the evidence in such case, as drawn into the
Code, (infra, H 4839-4842.) But notwithstanding the two preceding cases,
(which are not qucstioned,) it is held in Johnson v. Johnson, 1 Cold. 626-635,
—1st, that parties after long cohabitation and recognition of each other as man
and wife, are mapped, not only as against the public, but as against each other,
to deny that relation; and, 2d, that in such a case, where the llrst marriage is
proven to have been invalid under our statutes, a secoud legal marriage will be conclusively presumcd.—It seems that where a. marriage has taken place with
out license under a mistake as to the law, and a license is afterwards procured,

the proper certiﬁcate of the olﬁciating minister attached, and the same duly
recorded, this will not have eifcct by relation, so as to make the marriage valid
ab inilio; yet it is a strong circumstance tending to estop the parties, and all
other poisons, from denying the validity of the marriage. 1 Cold. 63-i.—And
whether, where an adual marriage has taken place, and the parties have C0l1ﬂb~
ited as man and wife, the marriage shall be held void for any irrcgiilai-itv of the
license, or bond, or certiﬁcate of solemnization, deserves a grave consideration.

ii. WHAT AVOXDS A auimiaoiz, [i'ufra, Q 2465.]

§ 1 lVant of legal capacity to contract, as -—

a. Insanity, or other mental incapacity at the time of the marriage. Cole v.
Cole, 5 Siiccd 57-9. Butsuch iiiczipacity must be established by clear proof. Ib.,
§ 59 -60. Sanity, and in persons of lawful age, capacity to contract, are always
presumed until the contrary appear. Ib., 60. The burden of proof is upon the

party imputing insanity.

Ib.

And this rule holds in cases of temporaryinsanity:

but where permanent insanity is shown, the burden of proof sliiﬂs to the party

alleging a lucid interval. Ib.

The general rule is that those who have not regular

use of their understanding, suilicicnt to deal with discretion in the common affairs
of life, or the weakness being so considerable as to amount to derangement, arc
incapable of contracting a valid marriage, or making any other binding contract.
lb. See Bisli. Mar. at Di\’., Q 125, 4th Edit. Delusion, eccentricity of conduct
or occasional paroxyms of derangement caused by disease, will not be sufﬁcient.
Ib., 61-2. A lunatic, on regaining his reason, may allirni a marriage celebrated

law, and which is fourteen years in males and twelve in females. Warwick v.
Cooper, 5 Sneed, 659-6!); Governor v. Rector, 10 Humph. 57, 61 ; Mclleynolds v.
State, 5 Cold. 18, 22. If a marriage takes place, either party being under that
age, it is inchoate and voidable; yet if the parties, when they arrive at that
age, agree to continue together, it is so far a marriage that they need not be
married again. 5 Sneed, 660 ; 10 Humpli ; 61. 6 Cold. 22-8 ; Cole v. Cole, 5
Sneed, 57, 63. And if the parties be of tho age of consent, though under the
age tweiity-one, the marriage is valid and obligatory, although it may have taken
place without the consent of parents or guardians. 6 Sneed, 660; 10 Humpli. 61.

assent to the marriage, and continue to live together us man and wife, this makes

capable of contracting.

§ 5 Cold. 24.

§ 2. Fraud.-—As to which see Castcllar v. Simmons, 1Tliompson's Cases, 92,
and editors note. In that case the female had recovered ajudgmcut for a breach of
promise ; to evade whieli,the defendant fraudulently conveyed his property to a stranger. The plaintiff then ﬁled her bill in chancery to set aside the fraudulent convey

ance; upon which the defendant, with the secret purpose of defeating this suit,
proposed marriage to her. She innocently accepted the proposal, the marriage
was duly solemnized, and immediately thereafter the defendant eloped with a
strnmpet. The Court, (Totten, J., dissenting, refused to declare this marriage a
nullity: it was voidable, but not void.—And see Mcliimney v. Clark, 2 Swan, 321,

where a marriage was entered into for the sole purpose of terminating a wife’s
estate upon condition, in certain property, vesting the remainder in her children,

and thereby defeating a. creditor who had obtained several judgments against her.
.'1'he Court held that this marriage was valid, and could not be declared a nullity at
the suit of a creditor. McKinney, J., in delivering the opinion, said; “ If a marri
age may be annulled for fraud, it must be such a fraud as operates upon one or the
other of the immediate parties to the contract, and has the legal effect of vitiat
ing the contract between the parties, ab initio. But, as respects sh-angers, fraud
cannot be predicated of a contract which the inmmediate parties thereto may law
fully enter into, which no principle of municipal law forbids, or can restrain tho
consummation of. “ This dictum is quoted and commented upon by Mr. Bishop
in his work on marriage and Divorce, Q 176, 4th edit.. See Q 2448, sub-sec. 9, and
note-; Q 2449, and note. '

§ 8. A previous marriage of one of Me parties subsisting.-—And if the siipposed
husband have a wife living, the rights of the second fema are in no wise affected
by the supposed marriage. She may after the fact of the ﬁrst marriage has been
established as by a conviction of bigamy, sue for and recover a chattel given her
by her father, and sold by the supposed husband, she being an infant at the time,
and assenting to the sale under the supposition that he was her lawful husband.
Sellars v. Davis, 4 Yerg. 603.
III. BY wnn LAW oovxam:n.
Marriageis a civil contract, depending respectively upon the law of each country
or sovereignty, and its constitution directed and controlled by the municipal regu
lations of each country or sovereignty, prescribing its rules and forms of solem
nization. Grisham v. State, 2 Yerg. 589, 592. Hence our Conrts of justice
recognize as valid all marriages of a foreign country, if made in pursuance of the
forms and usages of that country; and a marriage celebrated in an Indian
nation, according to the custom there prevailing, is valid in this State, although
such nation is situated territorally,_within the boundaries of this State. Morgan
v. McGee, 5 Humph. 13; and Reporter‘s note, sub _/in.
IV. Pnoor or MARRIAGE.
In general, marriage may be proved by cohabitation and general reputation.
Ewell v. State, 6 Ycrg. 364, 3'12 ; recognized in Johnson v. Johnson, 1 Cold. 626,

standing. Rogers v. Clark, 4 Humph. 480, 483; 1 Cold. 631.

V. BREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.

Where the defendant was an infant, though above the age of consent. Wzirwick
v. Cooper, 5 Sneed; 659. Where the defendant was already married. Carver v_
Davenport, 1. Hcisk. 368.
§ 2448. The following shall be causes of divorce from the
bonds of inatrimoiiy:
§ 1. That either party, at the tiuio of the contract, was and
still is naturally impotent and incapable of procreation.
[Act 1799, ch. 19, 1; 1835, ch. 26 § 1.]
\Ve ﬁnd enumerated together under this section, causes which render a mar
riage void at common law, and statutory grounds of divorce a viriculo, with the

power given to the court in § 2465 to declare the marriage null and void from the
beginning.

See Chunn v. Chunn, Meigs 131, 135-6.

§ 2. That either party has knowingly entered into a second
marriage, in violation of a previous marriage, still subsisting.

[Ib.]
And in such it case, the second marriage is a mere nullity, and has no ctfcct in law upon the status of the parties. See note to preceeding Article, II, 3; Swan
v, Harrison, 2 Cold. 534, 541.

§ 3. That either party has committed adultery.
Cases or
divorce from
bonds of mul
rlmony.

See Q 2460 and note.

§ 4. Wilful or malicious desertion or absence of either
party, without a reasonable cause, for two whole years.
|_lb.]
.
That is, not only without any reasonable causes, but for cause of malice; and

the malice contemplated by the statute is not malice in law, but malice in fact;
enmity of heart, or unprovoked malignity toward the person deserted. The
law intends that in such case of causeless and irreconcilable hatred, the union of
the parties is neither possible nor desirable, and that it is but just that the injured
party be released from the unhappy connection. Stewart v. Swan, 591, 592-3.

The deserlion or absence must be without good cause and malicious.

If the

party goes or remains sway for a reasonable, or oven without good and sufficient
cause, but not of malice, the divorce cannot be obtained. Rutledge v. Rutledge,
§ 5 Sneed, 254-57, citing and approving preceding case. See note to § 2452.

The two years absence must have expired before the commencement of the litiga
tion. Thus, where, before the wife had been absent four months, the husband ex_
hibitcd his bill for divorce on the grounds of adultery and attempt to take his

life by poison, he could not after the expiration of two years maintain a supple
mental bill for disertion or absence under this sub-section. Such a. bill should be
dismissed as frivolous. To expect her to retum to him while he was making and

litigating issues with her, “is a. proposition too monstrous for argument." Thomas
v. Thomas, 2 Cold. 123, 126-7.

§ 5. Being convicted of any crime which, by the laws of the
State, renders the party infamous. [Act 1835, ch. 26, § 1.]
§ 6. Being convicted of a crime which, by the laws of the
State, is declared to be a felony, and sentenced to confinement
in the penitentiary. [Act 1841-2, ch. 133, § 3.]
In Klutts v. Klutts, 4 Sneed, 423, lt was held that this Act did not embrace con

victions out of the State; but now seea 2450.—Sec § 2464.

§ 7. That either party has attempted the life of the other, by
poison or any other means showing malice.

[Act 1843-4, ch. 176, §1.]
§ 8. Refusal, on part ofa wife, to remove with her husband
to this State, without a reasonable cause, and willfully absent
ing herself from him for two years. [Act 1835, ch. 26 § 2.]
§ 9. That the woman was pregnant at the time of the mar
riage, by another person, without the knowledge of the hus
band.

[Act 1819, eh. 20, § 2, enlarged.]

This in Reynolds v. Reynolds, 3 Allen Mass. R., was held so strong a circum
stance of fraud as to warrant a decree declaring the marriage a nullity. There
are no reported cases in Tennessee where fraud alone has avoided a marriage, or

supported a decree for divorce; but in Custcllar v. Simmons, 1 Thompson’s Cases,
§ 92, 94, where the marriage was procured for n purpose grossly fraudulent, and
the defendant immediately after the ceremony eloped with a strumpet, it was held
that the complainant was entitled to relief by divorce and alimony. See note to prececding Article Ii; 2 Sharp v. Sharp, 2 Sneed, 496, cited under Q 2449.

Chapter 63 of the same session, passed on the same day as the above, and bear

which appears in the above. This was probably the same act as the above before
amendment, passed and published by mistake.

§ 2449. The following shall be causes of divorce from bed
and board, and from the bonds of matrimony, (a) at the dis

cretion of the court :
§ 1. That the husband is guilty of such cruel and inhuman
treatment or c_onduct towtu-ds his wife, as renders‘ it unsafe
and improper for her to cohabit with him, and be under his
dominion and control.
[Act 1799, ch. 19, § 9; 1835, ch. 26, § 19.]

§ 2. That he has offered such indignities to her person as to
render her condition intolerable, and thereby forced her to
withdraw. [Ib.]
§ 3. That he has abandoned her, or turned her out of doors,
and refused or neglected to provide for her. (b) [Ib.]
(a) The Act of 1841-2, ch. 133, Q 1, ﬁrst authorized thecourt to grant divorces
from the bonds of matrimony for the causes for which the Act of 1835 allowed di
vorces from bed and board only. Payne v. Payne, 4 Humph. 502; Shell v. Fhcll, 2
Sneed, 216, 218; Rutledge v. Rutledge, 5 Sneed, 554, 557-8. This Act was
only intended to meet cases of great aggravation, and to leave the remedy as it
was in all other cases falling under tho provisions of the old act. 5 Sneed, 558.
Unless the ease is of great aggravation, the relief was not intended to go beyond

a separation from bed and board, either indeﬁnitely or for a limited term.

Ib.,

§ 558-9. These liberal acts have been very much abused by tlie latitudinous con
struction given thctn by the courts. Ib., 558; 2 Snecd, 720.

(/1) The cause for-' divorce must be well averretl nnd well proved. 5 Sneed,
§ 5166 ; Q 2452 and note; Q 2459. A clear case must he made out under the law.
§ 5 Sneed, 559. It was never intended that the single fact that the parties became
dissatisfied with each other should constitute a ground ofdivorce. 2 Sneed, ‘E27.
What constitutes " such cruel and inhnnian treatment or conduct," on the part of
the husband towards his wife “ us to render it unsufc and improper for her to co
hubit with him,” and “ such ll'1dlg|\il.l0S to her per.-mu us to render lrer condition
intolerable, and thereby force her to withdraw " from his house, is di.-‘cussed at
length in this case. 2 Fneed, 716-729. Ill temper, occasional repronehcs, rude
language, or even n threat ol' violent-c toward the wife when none is attempted, are

not sul’ﬁcicut.""Ib.

But where the husbnnd used language totrardsltis wife which a

gs-ntleman,would not use towards his slaves; slnppel and choked her; and at

the family-itltar in her presence prayed God to deliver him from her,-upon all the fads of this case, the wife was entitled to a divorce ll vinculo.

Payne v.

Payne, 4 Humph. 500, 502; cited and approved in 2 Sneed, 722-3. And where
the husband practiced a fraud upon the wife in drawing an ante-nuptial settle
ment of lier property, and after the marriage slandered her reputation by charging

her with adultery, and treated her with indignity, a divorce 11 rinculo was granted
her with full restoration of her propeity. Sharp v. Sharp, 2 Sneed, 496. See,
:upra.,@ 2448, sub-sec. 9; note to proceeding Article, II, 2. And referring to
this ease, the court said in 2 Sneed, 728, “we have recently held that deliberate
and repeated accusations of adultery against the wife, by the husband, without
grounds, is a. suﬁicient cause." And in Rutledge v. Rutledge, above cited,
where thdliiisband abandoned the wife after provocation, but being also in fault
himself, and continued to contribute to her maintenance,a permanent divorce
from bed and board with alimony was granted at the suit of the wife.—But each
case must stand on its own facts. 2 Sneed, 7 28.

(c) See note a, to Sec. 2448, sub-sec. 6, supra.

(J) The act of 1799, cli. 19, required one years residence in this State previous
to ﬁling s petition for divorce. This did not mean a residence of one whole year, '
immediately preceding the ﬁling of the bill. Necessary absence on business, or

tor health or support, for more than a year, with an intention of returning and re
siding in this State was not an abandonment of the State, so as to bur petitioner
from the beneﬁt of that act. I-‘icklc v. Fickle, 5 Yerg. 208.

§ 2452. It shall set forth particularly and specially the
causes of the complaint, with circumstance of time and place‘,

defendant only, or for a divorce and such other and further"
relief as the complainant may think him or herself entitled
to. [Act 1835, c-11.26, § 3.]
Hora ¢wcrred.—The cause for divorce must be well arerred in the petition, in
words fully equal to the words of the statute, and deﬁnite in their meaning. If
this is not done the proof becomes irrelevant and useless, and no decree for divorce

can be made.

Thus, the allegation that the defendant abandoned complaina.nt’s

home “ without any just or probable cause," ctc., without sllegingthat the deser
tion or absence was malicious, will not sustain a decree for divorce under § 2448,
sub-see. 4. Stewart v. Stewart, 2 Swan, 591-2. The cause for divorce must be

well averred, as well as well proved. Rutledge v. Rutledge, 5 Sneed, 554, 556.

Pillow v. Pillow, 5 Yerg. 420. But
Ammdmmts in cliancery proceedings in matters of form are allowed with great
liberality, more especially so under our statutes in divorce cases. Hence, where
the bill was sworn to by a next friend, it was not error to amend by making the
aﬂidavit herself, as required by the Act of 1835, ch. 26, Q 4, [next section]; nor,

§ 2457. The defendant may appear according to the rules ofD+=rem=~

party upon matters of fact charged in the bill and denied in
the answer, and be_ tried by a jury in presence of the court;
and a new trial maybe gran ted of said issues should the court
deemed it necessary. [Ib.]
The petition and answer need not be read to the jury as forming the issues to
be tried, but the issues may be submitted to them on a separate peice of paper.
Richmond v. Richmond, 10 Ycrg. 343-4. Where an issue is submitted to a
jury, the answer is not evidence as in other chancery cases, requiriiig two wit
nesses, or one with corroborating circumstances, to overthrow it, but has merely
the effect n plea would have in making up the issue. Ib., 347-8. The trial by
jury bring here a matter of right, the court cannot disregard the verdict, as in
other cases ofan issue out of chanccry. Ib., 348. As was done in the dower
case of London v. London, 1 Humph. 1 ; and in Orgnin v. Ramsey, 3 Humph.
§ 580; and in Lowe v. Traynor, 6 Cold. 633, and cases cited. Seeﬁ 4465 et seq.

The evidence, and not the pleading and presumptions of law, constitute

the ground of divorce; and when a divorce is sought on the ground of adultery,
it must be made to appear affirmatively, by the pnrty seeking the divorce, even

aftcrpro confmo taken, by satisfactory proof of good character or otherwise, that
none of the foregoing defences exist, or the bill will be dismissed.

§ 2461. If upon a false rumor, apparently well founded, of
Helm
the death of one of the parties, who has been absent two whole
years, the other party marries again, the party remaining
single may, upon returning, insist upon a restoration of conjugal
rights or upon a dissolution of the marriage, and the court
shall sentence and degree accordingly, to wit: that the ﬁrst
marriage shall stand and the second be dissolved, or vice eersa ;
but such bill shall be ﬁled within one year after the return.
[Ib., § 8.]
Evidence, how

to be adduced.

§ 2462. Either party may take proof by depositions accord
ing to the rules and orders of the court, or have the witnesses
examined in open court at pleasure. [Ib., § 22.]
The parties have a right to take depositions as in cliancery suits, without an
order of court for that purpose. Richmond v. Richmond, 10 Yerg. 348, 845. In
Pillow v. Pillow, 5 Yerg. 420-21-2, Catron J., said that the evidence generally is,
and ought to be by parol, because of the trial of issues of fact by jury allowed by
the Act of 1799, ch. 18, [Q 2458.] And in Lucky v. Watkins, 8 Yerg. 191, where
a divorce case went to the Supreme Court and there abated upon the death of the

appellant, [note under § 2477,] the evidence, both oral and written, incorporated
into the bill of exceptions, was part of the record, and the clerk of the Supreme

Court was bound to enroll the same, and was entitled to his fees for so doing.
But now see as to the enrollment of chancery proceedings, § 3227.

§ 2463. If the divorce be demanded by the husband on the

ii§§§<i?""' " ground of the wife’:-i refusal to remove with him to this
State, and of her wilful absence for two years without rea
sonable cause, he shall prove endeavors to induce her to live
with him after the separation, and that he did not remove
from the State where she resided for the purpose of obtain

ing a divorce.

Whenwﬂell
§ 2464. The proof that the defendant is a convict or is
that defendant
sentenced to the penitentiary, if that be the cause relied upon for the divorce, shall be by the record of the conviction
and sentence. [Act 1842, ch. 133,§ 3.]
See§ _.°.-148, sub-see 6.

§ 2465. It", upon hearing the cause, the court is satisﬁed Bellmrorm of
that the complainant is entitled to relief, it may ‘be granted
either by pronouncing the marriage null and void from the

beginning, or by dissolving it for ever and freeing each party
from the obligations thereof, or by separation for a limited
time. [Act 1835, ch. 26, §§7, 19.]
"Null and void from the beginning.”—As to what constitutes ground for declar
ing a marriage a nullity, see note to preceding Article, II; Q 2448, sub-sec. 2, 9,

§ 2466. If the cause assigned by the wife for a divorce be 111¢°ﬁ,¢¢€¢

any of those speciﬁed in section 2-149, the defendant may §,l1n<i§n<i:3lin'¢¢
make his defence by insisting upon and proving the ill con-

We um.

duct of the complainant as a j ustitiable cause for the conduct

on his part complained of ; and, on making out the defence
to the satisfaction of the court, the bill may be dismissed
with or without costs, at the discretion of the court.

[Ib., § 20.]
§ 2467. But if the court be of opinion that the wife is en- A
marrin e., or

titled to rehet, it may be granted according to the prayer of§fa~"-,_r,§=_ a wr

the bill by annulling the marriage, or by ordering a separation
perpetual or temporary, or such other decree as the nature and
circumstances of the case require. [Ib., § 19.]
§ 2468. \Vhethcr the marriage be dissolved absolutely, or 8A1tmouY
perpetual or temporary separation be decreed, the court may
make an order and decree for the suitable support and main

tenance of the complainant and her children or any of them
by the husband, or out of his property, according to the na
ture of the case and the ci|'c1unstarfces of the parties.

Under the above two sections, the chanccry court has power to decree alimony
or a separate maintenance for the wife, as a separate, sustantive proceeding, where no divorce or separation is prayed for or decreed. Nicely
v. Nicely, 3 Head, 184; recognized in Swan v. Harrison, 5 Cold. 534,
§ 543, and in McBee v. McBee, 1 Heisk. 658, 561. But this right cannot be

enforced after the death of the husband.

Upon the happening of such an events

the right to alimony ends, and the new right to dower and a distributive share
of the husbaud’s pcrsonnlty begins. 2 Cold. 644. And whcre the Legislature,
before the constitution of1S34, granted a divorce on the petition of the husband
with the proviso “that nothing in this act contained shall deprive the said Ann
other right to alimony, if by law she is entitled to the same," alimony was decreed
the divorced wife on a bill for that purpose, the Court basing her right to the
same on the Act of 1799, ch. 19, Q 10, which is similar in terms to the following
section. Richardson v. Wilson, 8 Yerg. 67, 76, 83. Hence, although the only
mode of revising errors touching divorce is by appeal, Q 3158, yet a writ of error will lie from a decree concerning alimony, incident to a divorce. McBee v.
McBee, 1 Heisk. 558, 561.
Amount ofall
mony how to
be estimated,

§ 2469. And in such case the court may decree to the wife
such part of the husband’s real and personal estate as it may

think proper, in doing which the court may have reference to
the property which the husband received by his wife at the
time of the marriage or afterwards, as well as to the separate
property secured to her by marriage contract or otherwise.

[Act 1841-2, ch.133, § 2.]
Or will decree an annuity, to raise which the husband’s estate will be mortgaged,
as was done in Richardson v. Wilson, cited under preceeding section. And in
Chunn v. Chunn, Meigs, 131, 134, the court recognize the practice of alloting a por.
tion of the husband's income, and securing the payment of the same by charging
it upon his estate, as being the correct method, in cases of divorce from bed and
board. And in Rutledge v. Rutledge, 5 Sneed, 654, 561, where the husband had
no property, but an income derived from a public oilice, the court decreed alimony
out of his income, and ordered an account for the purpose of ﬁxing the amount
of the same. The ordinary practice in such cases is, not to decree to the wife
absolutely a certain portion of the husband’s estate, but to make an allowance in
money for her separate maintenance, payable at intervals, to continue until a

reconciliation, or until otherwise ordered by the court.

Chenault v. Chenault, 6

Sneed, 248, 251. And the husband cannot be discharged from the obligation to
furnish such maintenance after the separation any more than before, on the ground
that his estate or income is inadequate. Ib. And his future income from what
ever sources derived, including the earnings of his personal labor, and all subse
quent acquisitions, is chargeable with such allowance. Ib. And in this case it is
also said that such alimony or maintenance lusts no longer than the continuance
of the marriage relation, which is not dissolved __by the divorce from bed and
board ; and that it ceases upon a ﬁnal dissolution of the marriage by divorce a
vim.-ulo, in which case it was the duty of the court under the Act of 1841-2, ch.
§ 133, Q 2, to set apart to tho wife absolutely, a suitable portion of the husband’s
real and personal estate; but this is now changed by the above sections, and the
matter is left to the discretion of the court. But the course generally is, in case

of divorces a vincnlo, to make a reasonable division of the husband's estate, and
to vest in the wife absolutely, a speciﬁc portion thereof. 6 Sneed, 251. And
after the decree for alimony is entered, it is kept under the control and discretion
of the court. Pearson v. Pearson, Peck, 27, 28; Richardson v. Wilson, 8 Yerg.

§ 67, 81 ; Rutledge v. Ruthledge, 5 Sneed, 554, 661. And although the defendant
can appeal from a ﬁnal decree of divorce and alimony, yet he cannot appeal from
an order afterwards made for the payment of alimony then due. Peck, 28.
Upon a divorce a rinculo, the amount of the husband’s estate to be appropriated,

is within the legal discretion of the Chancellor [or J udge,] subject to the revision
of the Supreme Court. Robinson v. Robinson, 7 Humph. 440, 443. And it was
said in this case that the decree which the Chancellor had rendered, setting apart

half the defendant's land to the wife, and half to the husband, during their re
spective lives, with remainder to their children, was not warranted by law.

As was done in Sharp v. Sharp, 2 Sneed, 496.-This section states substantully
the principle enunciated in Ghunn v. Ohunn, Meigs, 131, which see. Tho pro
viso of the above act in favor of creditors introduced no ucw rule. Upon well
-established general principles of law, the claims of the husband‘s bona ﬁde creditors,
or liabilities property incurred in his behalf, existing prior to the application
for divorce, must prevail over the rights of the wife. McGhee v. McGhee, 2
Sneed, 221, 223. In this case the creditor was a judgment creditor “before the
decree was pronounced. " Ib. And though the husband cannot resist the restora
tion of the \vife‘s property on the ground that it will aﬂbct his creditors; yet the
Court will, so far as it consistently can, attend to their interests. Chunn v.

[Act 1845-6, ch. 216, § 3.]
See Q 2293. For the act regulating life insurance in this State, see Q 1880 cl. etseq.

This Act was simply intended to prevent the proceeds of the insurance from
passing to the personal representative of the insured, upon his death ; preferring,
to this extent, the widow and children to creditors.

It does not restrict the hus

band’s power of dispositions, during his life, over an ordinary life policy eﬁ'eeted~
upon his life. He may assign it to a creditor as collateral security; and if the _
creditor keeps it alive by payment of the annual premiums, he will be entitled out
of the fund accruing on the death of the insured, to payment of his debt and the
amounts advanced by him as premiums; the balance will go to the widow and

children under the statute of distribution,

Rison v. Wilkinson, 3 Sneed,
Note.—The policy in question in this case was an ordinary life policy, eii‘ected,as
tho Reporter seemed tothink, by way ofindcmnity to creditors; but this is not so
stated by the court. But it contained no clause making the proceeds payable in
the event of death to the widow and children, and was “without any special stipu

[Act-1849-50, ch. 36; § ’1.]

The husband’s estate at common law in his wife’s lands, and his separate power
to dispose or suifer adisposition of the same, are stated in Coleman v. Satterﬁeld, 2
Head, 259,263. And see Prater v. Hoover, 1 Cold. 544,547; Baker v. Heiskell, 1 Cold.
§ 641 ; Reed v. Reed, 3 Head, 491 ; Haywood v. Moore, 2 Humph 584, 588;

ble v. Jordan, 5 Humph. 417; Gillespie v. Worford, 2 Cold. 632, 639-45. But since
this statute, a. purchaser ofthe husband's interest in the wife’s landsacquires no_
interest which he can enforce against the wife. Young v. Lea, 3 Sneed, 249.
Hence, where the husband had conveyed the wife’s lands, and she afterwards
obtained a decree for divorce, and an order assigning to her her lands as alimony,
[Sceﬁ 2471,] the court refused to enjoin a writ of possession against the wife,
but ordered the vendee to account for the rents and proﬁts. Ib. The case of

Gillespie v. Worford, 2 Cold. 633, 989-45, [also .cited undei-Q 2076,] which holds
that the husband’s estate in the wife's lands, which he had conveyed during the
coirerture, was not defeated by a divorce a vinculo granted for a cause arising
subsequent to the marriage, and such as by the common law would not have
rendered the marriage void ab inilio was decided on a conveyance which arose
bzfore the abdve statut/e.—The husband's estate in the wife's lands at common
law, and his estate in the same under this statute, are stated and contrasted in
Coleman v Satterﬁeld, 2 Head, 259, and it is there held that where u. wife has
been driven by force or fraud toljoin in a conveyance of her lands, she may sue
separately in equity to have the sale set aside and possession restored to her,

making her husband a defendant.-But if the joint estate of herself and husband
is barred by the statute of limitations, she cannot sue separately in equity, until

discoverture.

Murdock v. Johnson, 7 Cold. 605, 615.

See Q 2757, note, (cl)

The spirit and intention of this statute is, that wives shall not be deprived of the
enjoyment of their real estate by any act of their husbands, or by their husband‘:
creditors even, without their solemn and free concurrence in the single mode pre
scribed by law. Prater v. Hoover, 1 Cold. 544, 648. And that mode is pointed

out, supra, Q 2076 at seq.

Where land is conveyed to husband and wife jointly,

they do not hold as joint tenants or tenants in common, but by prztiretics, subject
to snrvivorship. Taul v. Campbell, 7 Ycrg. 819 ; Amos v. Norman, 4 Sneed,

§ 2485. \Vhere a husband has either abandoned his wife, or
discliarged or driven her from his residence; and whore the

wife has left her husband and lives separate from him, in con
sequence of receiving from him personal abuse, or violent and
ill treatment, property acquired by her, after such separation,

or that she may receive by descent, or otherwise, shall not be
subject to his debts, nor be liable

after such separation ; nor shall he

continues.

This statute is expounded at length in Cooper v. Maddox, 4 Snecd, 145, 146

§ 51.

The original act contained aproviso, “ that this act is not intended to protect,

or secure to the wife, the enjoyment of any property which she may have acquired
previously to the separation having happened as aforesaid.” This act works an im
portant change, as well in respect to the status of the wife, as her rights of property.
It is a legal authority to her, without a judicial determination declaring n dissolu
tion of the marriage tie, or even a separation from bed and board for an indeﬁ
nite pcriod, to separate and live apart from her husband, and to acquire and
hold property independently of, and ndverscly to him. It was intended to effect
something more, on the wife's behalf, than an enlargement of her previously
existing right in equity to have her chores in action secured to her separate use.
It contemplates a more valuable and enduring beneﬁt than tho mere suspension of
the marital right during the life ofthe wife; its design was to exclude it altogether,
unless in the case of the single contingency provided for, that is, in case she
should voluntarily return to live with him. To this extent she is pluced in tho
condition of ufc-ma sole, Ema endowed with the legal capacity to acquire and hold
property with all the dominion and incidents of ownership, as against the hus
band, his creditors, and all other persons in the particular circumstances provided
for. It excludes the husbund‘s right of succession, as distributee of the wife,
us to all property acquired by her during the separation in any of the modes
pointed out. 4 Sneed, 149-151.

§ 2486. Whenever a husband has been ascertained to be in
sane by the verdict of a jury in the manner prescribed by law,
his wife may act as a single woman, to purchase, receive, and

hold property, real and personal ; to contract and be contracted
with ; to sue and be sued ; plead and be impleaded; and such
property as she may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, while
so acting, shall not be taken or made subject to the satisfaction
of the debts or contracts of the husband.

As to the wife's separate estate generally, see 8 King's Digest, QQ 7216-7248.
Also Curdwell v. Chatham, 2 Head, 14, and McFerrin v. White, 6 Cold. 499. In
Young v. Young, 7 Cold. 481, the Tennessee cases relating to the wife's power of

disposition over her separate estate, and the manner in which the same is to be
exercised, are reviewed at length, and as the result of the same, the following propo
BlllOIl5 are considered settled :
§ 1. That the power of disposition possessed by a feme covert over her separate

estate, is determined by the intention of the person granting or devising the estate,
to be ascertained by a fair construction of the deed or will.
§ 2. If the instrument creating the separate estate contains any express or im
plied restrictions upon the power of disposition, either as to the mode of convey
ing, or the purpose for which it may be conveyed, she can convey it in no other
manner, and for no other purpose.

§ 3.

Where n general power of disposition is, by the instrument of settlement,

expressly conferred upon the fme covert, without restriction or limitation as to
mode or purpose, she may convey the estate as n fem: sole, by proper instrument

of conveyance.

i

And in Sherman v. Turpin, 7 Cold. 382, where the land in question was conveyed
to Mrs. Turpin to her sole and separate “use, and with power to her at her pleas
ure to sell, convey, devise, or otherwise dispose of the same, in and when she may
see proper, as fully as if she were a feme sole," the Court say that the settled rule

in this State is, that a married woman may have in regard to the disposition of
her separate estate in lands, the full powers of a feme sole, if so expressed in the

instrument creating the estate.

Conveying as a feme sol: under the power con

ferred by the settlement, her privy examination as a fame covert becomes unnecessary; citing Young v. Young,‘ above quoted.

But the question remains, can a

wife convey hcr separate estate jointly with her husband upon privy examination
under the statute, mp1-a,§ 2076 etaeq.; and in Young v. Young, it is expressly
resolved that she can. 7 Cold. 476, 482. But the power of disposition may be
restricted or enlarged by the terms of the settlement, and in construing these terms,
the intention of the settler, as apparent upon a fair construction of the instrument,

must govern.

Ib., 482.

And where the instrument which settles an estate upon

a married woman to her sole and separate use, is silent as to her power of dispos
ing of the same, this does not operate to deprive her of such power, nnd a con

veyance made by her under such a settlement is valid.

Ib., 477 cl seq.

The above

resolutions refer only to conveyances of realty; and whether there is any differ
ence in this respect between conveyances of realty, and conveyances of pcrsonalty,
the court expressly reserve. Ib., 477. Thcs_o decisions aroso bcforc the passage

[Act 1847-8, eh. 115.]

The obvious reason and policy of this statute are shown in a case dedided before
its existence, Massingale v. Hale, 4 Hayw. 30. The ease of McAlister v. Olm
stead, 1 liumph. 210 where a person was appointed both executor and guardian

also arose before this statute.

And in ex parle Crutchﬁeld, 8 Yerg. 336, the

court justified the removal of the administrator, from the office of guardian on the
ground, among others, that the appointment of the administrator to that oﬂico
was an improvident act. And so, it was against all rules of propriety to appoint
an executor guardian ad litcm of his tcstator’s children.

§ 2490- 249!
Elrod v. Lancaster, 2

Head, 571, 674. The case of Jones v. Ward, 10 Yerg. 160, exhibits a complicated
settlement of an estate by an executor who was also guardian of his testator’s
children. In that case, where the executor and guardian, before the expiration
of two years from the time he became executor, paid a debt which one of the
children had improvidently contracted at college, it was held that such payment
was unauthorized by law, and that the executor was chargeable with the amount;
but as he had paid it before the expiration oftwo years from the time he became
executor, it was held that he paid it as executor, and not as guardian ; and hence
was only chargeable with simple, and not with compound interest. 10 Yerg. 16?.

§ 2490. A wife abandoned by her husband may be appointed Mom, when

Court, where her bill for a. divorce is ﬁled, if the court ﬁnd
that she is entitled to the divorce ; and in either case she shall

have the custody, care and education of her children, on giv

[Act 1841-2, ch. 21, § 1, csctendezi] '
See State as rel Payne v. Payne, where the discretionary power of the court to
bestow the custody of the child either upon the father or mother as shall best
subscrve the child's interest is declarcd.—Habeas corpus lies at the suit of the
father to recover possession of his child, the father having, at common law, the
exclusive right to the custody of his children. But the court will control the rule
of the common law, and decree according to tho interest of the child; and where
the child has attained discretion, the court will leave it to its choice. 4 Llumph.

ship, unless the court should think the interest of the minor
requires the appointment ofsome other person.

[Act 1s23, ch. 2, § 1.]
The father is the natural guardian of his children ; but he is guardian for nur
ture only, and has no authority to intermeddle with their estates. Haynes v.
Hall, 5 Hnmph. 290, 293; Miles v. Kaigler, 10 Yerg. 10, 15. The guardian for
nurture has only the care and education of the infant, imd has nothing to do with
his lauds. Ross v. Cobb, 9 Yerg. 463, 468. He cannot make a valid lease of the

infants‘ lands, either in his own name or that of the infant; and this is especially
true where by statute general guardians are required to give bond. Ib. As by
§ 2494. If he receive a debt or legacy, he can give no aequittance therefor, and
the debtor or executor will be responsible to the infant on his arriving at full age,
as if he had not paid the father. 10 Ycrg. 16; 9 Yerg. 469. But where the
father holds a chattel for three years in good faith for the beneﬁt of his infant son,
this possession will perfect the infant's title under the statute of limitations,

Williams v. Walton, 8 Yerg. 387, 392.

The possession inuring to the beneﬁt of the infant the same as if the chattel were held by a. general guardian.
Ib. See Davis v. Mitchell, 5 Yerg. 281. But where the father leased the infants’
land, and the tenant attorned to another, the tenant's possession after thus deny

ing the infants’ title was not the possession ofthe infants, and did not inure to the
beneﬁt of their title under the statute of limitations, [Q 2763.] The reason is,
that estoppels must be mutual. The lease being void, created no estoppel against:
the infants, and therefore none against the tenants.

tain v. Cowcn, 3 Humph. 315, 317. The omission to state the names of the wards

in the record of the appointment of the guardian, it‘ a defect, is remedied by the

the State, conditioned for the faithful discharge of his duty,
which condition shall include every default which a guardian
can commit in his ofﬁee.
[Act 1762, ch. 5,§ 5; 1847—8, ch. 167.]
Extent of Iiabilitg/.—Sce note to Q 2499.

The words of this section, which

condition shall include every default which it guardian can commit in his office,"
were not in the previous acts. Before the Code, the sureties of a guardian were

not liable for the proper management of the ward's share of the proceeds of real
estate sold in chancery for partition. In such a case it was necessary that aspecial
bond be taken. Case of Andrews’ Heirs, 3 Humph. 592. Nor were they liable
for work and labor performed by the wards for the guardian. Philips v. Davis, 2
Sneed, 520. But on a settlement of a guardianship in chnncery, where the guard
ian sought to credit the fund in his hands with disbursements on behalf of his
wards, it was competent for the wards to show that such credits ought not to be
allowed, because they had been paid and discharged by work and labor, or other
wise; and if so, should not operate as a discharge as to the fund in his hands
as guardian. To this extent such adverse claim might be considered, and for
that purpose and no other allowed in the settlement. And in such a ease, whens
the amount due the wards for work and labor exceeded the fund in the guardiau‘s
hands, he and his sureties were charged with the full amount of the fungl notwith standing his disbursements, with interest and costs.

Ib.

A guardian is liable

for failure to call his predesessor in the oilice to account; and in such a case,
where a recovery and satisfaction have been had against him, he is entitled to be
subrogated to the rights of the wards against the ﬁrst guardian; or if he has
satisﬁed the iirst guardiau’s deﬁciency, he may, in a suit by the wards against the
ﬁrst guardian's surety, be, by an order of court, under the enlarged power of

amendment conferred by the Act of 1851--2,
record as plaintiff in place of the wards.

.Dinc/targe ofsurcl_z/ by act of ward.—[f the ward on coming of age, or, in case
of a female ward, her husband, take from the guardian a new security, as a note
or order on a third person, for the payment of the amount duc from the guardian
to the ward, without the consent of the sureties in the guardi:u1‘s bond, this will
operate as a release to them. Bond v. Bay, 6 Humph. 492. See also Hill v.
Bostick, 10 Yerg. 410. But where the ward had arrived at age, and the amount
of the guardian’s indebtedness had been ascertained by settlement, and the hus
band of the ward drew orders upon the guardian in favor of third persons, which
he accepted, these orders did not have the ctfcct of changing the guardiau’s lia
bility into a private debt, so as to discharge his sureties. Ib.

Remedy on bond.--An action will lie on a guardian's bond iu the ﬁrst instance,
and need not be preceded by an account in equity to ascertain the guardian's
liability. The election of the proper remedy is given to the plaintiff; and it is not
with the guardian in default to dictate in what forum he shall be reached. Jus_
tices v. Willis, 3 Yerg. 461. And this is true, whether the guardian is sued alone,
or jointly with his sureties. Foster v. Maxey, 6 Ycrg. 224. And relief may be
had on an informal bond in equity. Thus, by the Act of 1762, the bond was to
be made payable to the c/uzirnmn of the county court; but where a gua.rdian’s
bond had been taken, payable to the jmtices, this, though void at law, was held to
involve a. mistake of fact, which would entitle the ward to relief in equity by an
account against the sureties. Farrell v. Dooley, 6 Humph. 110; citing Armstead
v. Bozman, 1 Ired. Eu. 117 ; Winan v. Blacklcy, 1 John. Ch. 607. And so where
the guardian‘s bond was executed in blank, and contained no penalty, although
this would prevent a recovery at law, yet upon proof that upon the fuith of this
bond, the guardian got possession of the \vard’s estates, the liability of the surety
could be enforced in equity. Much less could third persons be heard to deny

that liability.

Limitation.-Since, then, a right of action at law exists against a guardian im
mediately aftcr his removal, without waiting to ascertain his liability by an account
in equity, it follows that in case of the death of a surety, the action must be
brought against his personal representative within seven years after qualiﬁcation,
or it will be absolutely barred by the Act of 1715, ch. 48, Q 9, [Fﬂ 2281, 2786.]
Foster v. Maxey, 6 Yerg. 224. But in Caplinger v. Vaden, Meigs; 175, 180, it is
held that the settlement between guardian and ward after the ward attains his ma-_

date of the settlement, so as to perfect the guardian’s title to property purchased

with the ward's money, and on the settlement assigned to tho guardian, and
thenceforward claimed and held by him as his own.

[Act 1s41-2,¢11. 117, §§ 1, 3.]
This Act does not provide that the former sureties be released. Their liabiliy
continues unless they are released in conformity with the provisions of the statutes
on that subject, [Q 8672 ct seq.] Jamison v. Corby, 11 Humph. 273, 276. The
new suretics are cumulative to the former, and so upon each renewal, the sureties
are cumulative. Ib. But the different sets of suretics are not liable to action at
the same time, or to make payment at the same time; but the last surctics taken
are tlrst liable, and so backwards in that order. Ib. The liability of each set of
suretics extends not only to the future acts of the guardian, but relates hack to
his ﬁrst appointment, and is co-extensive with the guardianship. Ib., 277. The
same principle holds where guardians’ suretics are released and others substituted,

[Q 8672.] In such case the new suretics are hound, retrospectively, for the entire
period of the guardianship. Crawford v. Penn, 1 Swan, 388, 890. And also
where new sureties are given by way of counter security, the old surcties not
being released. Steele v. Rccsc, 6 Yerg. 263. But where new sureties are sub
stituted und the old ones released, the old ones are notexonerated from their pre

vionsliahility.

Q 3677.

Where the guardian executed a mortgage as indemnity

to his sureties, and afterwards his bond was renewed, and one of the old suretics
became a suretics in the new bond, this did not discharge the mortgage as to him,

but the entering into the new bond by this surety was a continuation ofhis liabil
ity, and the mortgage applied to the new bond'as well as to the old one; and

after a recovery against him as surety on the bond, he was entitled to have the mortgage foreclosed for his beneﬁt, and that of his co-sureties.

§ 2500. Should any guardian fail to renew his bond, as required in the preceding section, the court shall remove him, '°m°"d‘m'

blltty for Ml

the ward, for any damage sustained thereby.
[Act 1841--2, ch. 117, § 3.]
By the Act of 1762, ch. 5, Q 5, the justices were liable for all loss or damage
sustained by the ward by reason of their committing his estate to n guardian with

out taking good and sufficient security in the ﬁrst instance; but by section 6 of
the same act, if the sureties were good at the time of their being taken, but alter
wards became insolvent, the justices were not liable. These provisions were not
carried into the Code.—Under the peculiar phraseology of the Act from which the
above section was drawn, it was held in Boyd v. Ferris, ‘l0 Humph. 406, that the
liability of the justices extended only to their failure to take good security upon

the renewal of the guardian's bond, and that they were not liable for failing to
remove the guardian, where he failed to renew his bond, as provided in the ﬁrst

section of the Act, [Q 2500.]

The addition of the words “in regard to the renewal

of guardian bonds " after the word " duty " in the above, is an enlargement oftho

original act, and would seem to indicate an intention on the part of the revisers of
the Code, to avoid this construction. Eds.—But for the wilful and malicious
refusal of the justices to discharge the duty prescribed in the ﬁrst section of the

original act, [Q 2500,] an action at common law may be maintained.

§ 10 Humph.

§ 410. In such a case, the conduct of the justices must be alleged to have been
wilful and malicious, either in terms, or in language of similar import. Ib., 411.
But in support of such averment, it is not required that there shall be express
proof of malice or corrupt motive on the part of the justices. It is suﬂicient if
it may be implied from their conduct; and a stronger case for the application of
this principle cannot well be supposed than the failure or refusal of the justices to
obey the plain but peremptory commands of the Act of 1842. Ib.
“ The justice: present shall be liable.”—'l‘he Act of 1762, ch. 5, § 5, [omitted from
the Code, as above stated,] made “the justice or justices appointing such guardian
liable." In a suit against the justices under this Act, it was necessary that it should
be made to appear that the justices sought to be charged actually participated in
the appointment. Strong v. Harris, 3 Humph. 451, 455. The fact that a justice

signed the minutes of the day on which the order of the appointment was made,
was not of itself sullicicnt to charge him with liability; for it was not intended

that he should satisfy himself that the court had acted correctly in making the
-orders before signing them.

Ib.

In such a suit the facts stated in the record of

the County Court cannot he contradicted by direct proof or circumstantial evi
dence; and, therefore, proof tending to establish the fact that the Clerk of the

County Court was in the habit of stating on the record the names of justices as
present at the commencement of the court who were not present, was not ad

missible.

Ib., 454.

The fact exhibited by the record that the justice sought to

be charged was present at the opening of the court and signed the minutes of the
,-proceeding dny, or that he signed the minutes on the day on which the appoint

iment was made, was not conclusive evidence which would estop him from denying that he was present when the order was made, but were proper eir~
cumstance.-1 to be weighed by the jury in deter-mininﬁ whether or not he was

actually present. at the making of the order.

Ib., 452-3.

And for the purpose of

“ Waste,” etc.—It is said in Darby v. McCarroll, 5 Ilnyw. 286, 292, that deeds

the minority of the ward, because they did not purport to beleases in writing, nor
were covenants made that the tenants should improve the plantation, nor other
covenants required by the Act of 1762, without which the lease would be void.
But in Ross v. Blair, Meigs, 525, 545, it is held that the provision in the statute

against waste is mandatory, and the omission of a covenant in the lease against
waste does not absolve the tenant from the duties and liabilities of the relation into

which he has entered.

The power of the County Court to remove a guardian is discretionary; and on
account of the superior opportunities of the County Court for forming a cor
rect view of the wholecasc, its action in removinga guardian will not be reversed
in the Supreme Court, especially where it has met the approbation of the Circuit

Court.

E: parle Crutchﬁeld, 3 Yerg. 336.

The conversion of his ward’s real

estate into personalty, by a guardian who was also administrator, although
done with good motives and without fraud, and although the-real estate was sold
for its fair value, was a sufficient cause for the removal of a guardian. Ib. If
the guardian in a proceeding to remove him, have legal notice to appear and
defend, so that the court hasjurisdiction of his person, the order ofremoval need

only be general, and need not recite 'the cause of removal.

Gwiu v. Vanzant, 7

Yerg. H3. In such a case, the revising court will presume that the county court
acted correctly, unless the contrary appears. Ib'., 145. But in such a case, the
revising court will not/presume, in favor of the proceedings of the County Court,
that the defendant had notice : that fact must appear of record. Ib., 144-5.
Where the defendant was served with citation to appear on the ﬁrst Monday in
September, and no_step was then taken, this notice would not support an order re
moving him, in general terms and without assigning cause, entered at the subse
quent, December, term. Ib. But it seems that a guardian may for good cause be
removed in his absence and without notice ; as where he has removed or absconded,
so that he cannot be notiﬁed. But in such eases the record must specially show
the grounds of removal, so that the guardian may contest the validity of the act.
Nothing can be presumed in favor of a general order, where there is no notice.
Ib., 145. The proceeding to remove a guardian is of a nature similar to a proceed
ing to remove an officer, or a proceeding for contempt, and governed by similar
rules of procecdure. Ib., 144-5. See note to Q 2493.

or sentenceto the Circuit Court of the county.

[Act 1762, ch. 5, § 24.]
An appeal from an order removing a guardian, where the court alone are to act,
takes up the whole cause, and it may be proceeded in above, as if it were a writ
of error to reverse a void order. Gwin v. Vanzant, 7 Yerg. 143, 145. See note
to perceding section.

Nora. Guardians power over ward'a property; eject of sale; cmwers-i'on.—-As a
general rule, a guardian has no power, without the direction of a court'ol' chan
oery, to convert the personal estate of an infant into reality, or to invest his
money in land. Neither has the guardian any power whatever to convert the
real estate into personuiy; 'l_‘he court of chancery itself has no inherent original
jurisdiction to convert the real estate of an infant,the power to do so beiugderived
entirely from the Act of 1827. Singleton v. Love, 1 Head, 357, 362. Now see
§ 3293 elseq; Q 3323. But as respects the investment of an infant's money in
land, the jurisdiction of changing the nature of the estate has been exercised by
the [ehaneery] court, where it has been made to appear that it would be for the
manifest beneﬁt of the infant; and in some eases the court has supported the oonverson by a guardian ont of court in investing the infant's money in land,
where the circumstances were such that the court itself would have directed a

like investment.

But the infant, when he arrives at full age will have his election

to take the land, or tho money thus invested, with interest. 1 llead. 362. And if
the infant dies under the age of twenty one, his personal representative will
have a right to treat the laud purchased with the infants moneyas personal assets,

and distributable as such.

Ib., 362-3.

But in case of a female ward, if she

marries during her minority, her husband being sui jm-is, may perhaps with her
concurrence, disaliirm the purchase. lb. But neither the ward nor her persona!
representative can ratify in part and repudiate in part. So, if one tract is sold
and another bought with the proceeds, the sale of the ﬁrst cannot be ratiﬁed, and
the purchase of the second repudiated. lb. And property purchased by a guard

ian in his own name with his ward's money, stands charged with the same trust
asdid the money ; and the ward, on coming of age, may at his option take the
money or the propert-_v; and ifwith full knowledge ofhis rights, he elects to take the
money, the property discharged of the trust, vests in theguardinn absolutely. Cap
linger v. Stokes, Meigs, 175; Gannaway v. Tarpley, 1 Cold. 572, 579;'l‘ur-nor v. Petti
grew, 6 Humph. 488. Ifuuly part oftheland was paid for out of the ward's funds, he
would only be entitled pro tanto. 1 Cold. 580. But the wards cannot in such a case
recover land from an innocent purchase without notice; for the equities of the

purchaser and the wards being equal, the legal title will prevail.

§ 6 Humph. 410.

And if the creditor of a guardian knowingly receive the ward‘s property in dis

charge of his debt, he is responsible to the ward.

llIcAlister v. Olmstead, I

Humph. 210, 227. Thus if the surety of the guardian is indebted to him for
property of the wards, purchased by such surety, and he afterwards pays a private
debt of the guardian, he is not entitled to set oﬂ such payment against the debt
due the guardian in his official capacity, unless it was agreed, when the money
was advanced on the guardian debt, that it should go in discharge of the sur'ety‘s
dcbt. Ib. And so if aguardian, or other trustee, agree to do an act which in
itself is a manifest breach of trust, and the party who concurs in the act has
notice of the trust, neither party will be heard in a court of justice to insist on
the performance of that act. Such an agreement being regarded as a fraud upon
the rights of the beneﬁciary, all who parcticipate in it knowingly are equally
affected by it. Lancaster v. Allen, 1 Head, 326. Thus, where a guardian sued
on a note executed to him as guardian for the hire of slaves of his ward, it was
no defence that guardian had purchased of the maker property for his own use,
and had agreed to apply the same in payment of the note. lb. Nor can a guardian
consent to a conversion of his ward’s property, so as to defeat an action of trover
brought by his wards for the recovery of the property, for 0. guardian has only
a nakei authority not coupled with an interest. Huggins v. Moore, 3 Head, 426.

Thus, where a guardian hired out the slave of his ward to work at a mill,_ with
a stipulation that he was no‘. to work as ﬁreman, and the hirer worlred the slave
as ﬁremen, and also sub-hired him, and the ward sued for a conveiision of the
slave, it was held that the consent of the guardian after the hiring, to the sub
hiring and working the slaves as ﬁremen, would not bar a recovery. lb. Other
wise with an executor or administrator; he has absolute dominion over the

trust property in his hands.

Where an executor. was also testamentary guardian [see note to Q 2489,] in
the absence of any reason why the cxecutorship should continue, he was held liable
as guardian from and after the expiration of the two years in which by law he is

required to settle the estate, [Q5 3311, 2312,] and as such guardian chargeable
with compound interest. computed by annual rests. Jones v. Ward, 10 Yerg. 160;
§ 170-71. The rule for computing the interest in this case was stated as follows:
“The account of the executor with the estate will be balanced at tho end of two
years from the time he became executor, upon the sum then found to be in his
hands, he will be charged with interest till the end of the year; the amount of his

disbusements subsequent to the stricking of the balance, will he deducted from
this sum of principal and interest, and the balance will stand as the sum on which
interest is to be calculated for the succeeding year. This method will be continued
as long as the defendant acted as guardian of the legatees. From the time
he ceased to be guardian, either by the marriage or the majority of the legatee, he

will be only charged with simple interest. . 10 Yerg. 170-71. And see note to
Q 1949.—Where the guardian used the funds of his ward, and afterwards resisted
the payment of the same, it was held proper to charge him wi'.h interest, although

it appeared that it would have been dangerous and unwise to loan out the fund
on account of the unsettled state of aifuirs consequent upon tbe late civil war.

[Act 1849-50, ch. 34, §§ 1, 2; 1843-4, ch. 122, § 2.]
In the case of Andrew's heir's, 3 Humph. 592, which arose before the above Act
of 1813-4, where it was held that the foreign guardian should give it special bond
for the speciﬁc Tennwsee fund; and that the court should see to it, that such
bond was sufficient, and conditioned according to the State where the guardian

and wards reside.

See also Allen v. Ferguson, Jackson Special Nov. Term, 1867,

cited in 3 King Dig., Q 7067, where it is held that the removal by guardian to an
other State contrary to the law of this State, of property in which he and his ward
have a joint interest, is a conversion; and that guardians appointed by another
State are liable to account here as trustees.
§ 2545. The clerk of the court having jurisdiction of the
estate shall keep a well-bound book for wards who have at
tained the agc of twenty-one years, or females who have mar
ried, in which he shall record as executed, and carefully index
and preserve, every receipt or acquittance for each ward’s in
tercst, and every authority or power of attorney for the execu

§ 2546. Guardians shall have the same power to resign as
executors and administrators; and they shall exercise this
power in the same manner. [Act 1851-2, ch. 141, § 6.]
See Q 2237 at seq.—But in a case arising before this statute, it was held that
the resignation of a guardian, where no account of his guardianship was taken,
nor any steps to secure the estate, and no guardian appointed in his place, was
void. Bartee v. Tompkins, 4 Humph. 623, 625.
§ 2547. Wliere the estate of an orphan is of so small value om,“ “hm
that no person will educate and maintain him or her for the

person, approved by the court, until he shall attain the age of
twenty-one years; and every female to some suitable employ
ment, till her age of eighteen years, unless the court, in its

discretion, should think proper to bind the orphan for a shorter
period. [Act 1762, ch. 5, §19; 1853-4, ch. 53, § 2.]
“ For the proﬁts thereof."—See Q 2506, 2513, 2513 a, 2580.
Binding by pm-ent.—It is asserted in Stringﬁeld v. Hieskell, 2 Yerg. 546, that
a father may bind his infant son without the infant's consent; but this is
overruled as dicla in Stewurts v. Ricketts, 2 Humph. 151, and it is there held that
an indenture of apprenticeship executed by the master and the father of the infant,

without thejnfant joining in it, is not illegal or void, and if the infant perform its
covenants on his part, the master will be compelled to perform his.

§ 2548. The court may, in like manner, apprentice every Bumd to 5,

[Act 1762, ch. 5, § 19.]
See Q 5354, at seq.—Under the old acts, the court could not apprentice a bas

maintain it. Lawson v. Scott, 1 Yerg. 92, 96. But now see Q 1625.

§ 2549. Any child totally abandoned by the father, and for Chm ,1“.

[Act 1853—4=, ch. 53, § 1.]
Binding to be

§ 2556. The binding of an apprentice, by order of court,
shall be by indenture, made in the name of the State, of the
one part, and of the master or mistress to whom the apprentice
is bound, ofthe other; and said indenture shall be acknowl
edged before the court and recorded.
[Act 1762, ch. 5, § 20, modiiied.]
In o suit upon such an indenture, the fact that it was not properly acknowl
edged and recorded, cannot be taken advantage of by demurrer. Finch v. Gore,
§ 2 Swan, 326, 330. The indcnture in this case was signed on the one part by the

chairman of the county court under the old law, to whom it was taken. The bond be
ing drawn in question by demurrer, it was held--1st, that it was good if taken to
the chairman of the county court without mentioning his successors, since the
bond was taken to the office, and not to the person: 2nd, that ifmade to the wrong

person it still is a good voluntary bond, on which an action might be maintained
at common law, citing Hibbits v. Canada, 10 Ycrg. 467: 3rd, that in such a case, the common law action would have to be brought in the name of the person to
whom the bond was made payable or if dead, his personal representative, citing
Jones v. Wiley, 8 Humph. 141 ; and 4th, where the oﬁicial character of the chair
man who signed the bond was twice stated in the body of the bond, it was not

necessary it should be stated in signing the bond.

Although under the old law,

suit on the bond had to be brought in the name of th_e chairman of the county
court; yet the substantial and legal interest was in the infant; he or his personal
representative is the “person injured” in the sense of the act; the legal right
to the sum recovered vests in the apprentice as soon as collected, and he alone,
and not the chairman in whose name the suit was brought could bring suit for
the same against the attorney who presented the suit and received the money.

[Act 1762, ch. 5, § 19, enlarged]

This only expresses the minimum required of the county court in binding out
orphans; but it is not restrictive, and it is the duty of the court to get the best
terms it can ; and though the terms of the indenture exceed those of the statute,
this does not impair its validity as a statutory bond. Finch v. Gore, 2 Swan,

shall not be subject to any other or diﬂ'e1'ent punishment, pains

as are prescribed for white persons commiting like acts or
offences. [Ib., § 2.]
“ To give evidence."— See Q 3809 a.
“ To inIzerz't’.'—Sce Q 2435a et seq.
“ To any other or dijermt pum'.shment.”-—The effect of the above section taken
connection with the general repealing clause of Q 4, [Q 2745 ainfra,] was to
repeal those parts of the slave code which inﬂicted on slaves or free persons of
color, other or different punishments than these inﬂicted on white persons for the
same offenses. Wharton v. State, 5 Cold. 1; Boyd v. State, 7 Cold. 69. And
there being no provision in the statute saving the right to prosecute such persons for such oﬁeuses, the repeal operates as a pardon of all crimes and oﬁ'enses com
mitted previous to the passage of the act, by slaves and free persons of color
where the punishment was ditferent from that prescribed for free white persons.
§ 5 Cold 5-7; 7 Cold. 73, 74. Thus, a colored person, after he became free, could
not be punished for a rape committed upon a free white person, while he was
a slave. 5 Cold. 1-7. And the act changed the punishment of murder in the

second degree committed by slaves and free persons of color, which by the Code,
QQ 2625 and 2725, was capital; but it did not change the punishment for mur
der in the ﬁrst degree committed by such persons. Hence, where a person of ‘
color was convicted, after the passage of this act, of murder in the ﬁrst degree
committed after emancipation but before its passage, it was held that the act did
not relieve him of the penalty attached to this oﬁ'ense. 7 Cold. 76. And see

or his representatives and privies, as the case may be, may,

after the reversal or arrest.
The above two sections were compiled from the Acts of 1815, ch. 27, § 6; and
§ 1819, ch. 28, § 3. These acts made provision for bringing a new suit which
saved the bar only in three cases, viz. :
§ 1st,.wherejudgmeut for the plaintilfhad been reversed on error; 2d,wherejudg
ment had been arrested; 3d, where the defendant could not be served with process.
In all these cases, ifa new suit was commenced within a year, the statute did not
operate as abar. Nicholson v. Lauderdale, 3 Humph. 200; Anderson v. Bedford,

§ 4Cold. 464, 469; Cole v. The Mayor 8: Aldermen oi‘ Nashville, 5 Cold. 639, 641.
But the language of section 2755, “against t/:.eplaintr:ﬂ',” and “upon any ground

not concluding his right of action," is held to extend the rule established by the
original statutes.
Hence where a suit was dismissed, because the papers were lost, and were
not supplied when it was regularly reached for trial, it was held that this did not
conclude the plaintiﬂ‘s right of action, and that he might sue again within a
year. Cole v. Mayor &: Aldermen of Nashville, 5 Cold. 689.

§ 1. As to real actions. The words of the Act of 1715, ch. 27, § 4, were, “at
the time the said right or title ﬁrst descended, accrued, come, or fallen - ” and
“ after the title or claim becomes due."

The words of the Act of 1797 ch. 43, § 4, were, “from the time of such
peaeeable possession having been obtained."
The words of the Act of 1819, ch. 28, § 2, were, “after his, her, or their
right to commence, have, or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen or ac~

crued.”
In Hayﬁeld v. Ssawell, Cooke, 437,446, where the owner of a land warrant
had ﬁled it in the proper oﬂice in order to obtain a grant, it was said his right of

action against an adverse claimant would not accrue, until there should be a
grant issued to such adverse claimant, or at least a survey made for him.
A wife has no cause of action, where the husband, tenant by the curtesy ini

tiate, conveys her lands in fee during the eoverture; for this only operates to
discontinue his interest : McCorry v. King’s Heirs, 8 Humph, 267,277 ; Miller
v. Miller, Meigs R. 484,491.

No right of action exists, unless there is an adverse claim set up to the land,
or an adverse possession. Neddy v. The State, 8 Yerg. 249,251.
The statute begins to run against a vendor‘s lien from the time the purchase
money becomes due. Sheratz v. Nicodemus, 7 Yerg. 9, 13.
It was said in case of Reeves and Hayter v. Doughtery and Ewing, 7, Yerg.
§ 222, 233, that in case of a bill to obtain relief against a fraudulent conveyance
the statute would begin to run in favor of the fraudulent vendee, at the time of
the execution of the deed, and that whenever the statute would create a bar in
favor of the fraudulent vendee against the fraudulent vendor, it would bar the
creditors of the vendor. But in Jones v. Reu.d,1Humph. 335, 347, this doctrine
was repelled in forcible terms, and the rulo was laid down that the statute would

only begin to run against the creditors from the date of their judgment at law.
The statute does not begin to run against a reversioner or remainder-man
until the termination of the particular estate. McCorry v. King, 8 Humph. 267 ;
Williams v. Conrad, 11 Humph. 412, 418 ; Bradford v. Coldwell,‘2 Head, 496,

§ 500.
§ 2. As to personal actions. See Hawkins v. Walker, 4 Yerg. 188,192; Lewis
v. Brooks, 6 Yerg. _l67, 184; Weatherhead v. Boyers, 7 Yorg. 545, 562; Scott v.
Lanham, 8 Yerg. 420, 423; Cocke v. Evans, 9 Yerg. 287, 297 ; Thurman v.
Shelton, 10 Ycrg. 383, 387; Jones v. Reed, 1 Humph. 842, 347; Wade v. Green
§ 3 Humph. 5-17, 557; Porter v. Porter, 3 Humph. 586, 690; Boyers v. Boddie,
§ 8 Humph. 666, 669; Coleson v. Blanton, 3 Ilayw, 156, 159; Ward v. Gavin, 1

Head, 506,510.
(5) The Legislature takes the time when the action accrues as the period,
at which the disability is ﬁxed. The condition of the party then, as being with
in the disability or not, must determine his rights and liabilities, and save him
from, or expose him to, the operation of the statute. Hence, if an action ac
crue to a man, and he shall die the next day, the act commences running against
him, and must continue to run, though his representatives may be infants.
Shute v. Wade, 5 Yerg. l, 8-9; Jones v. Preston, 3 Head, 161.
As to real actions. Wliere there arc several infants, tenants in common, and
one after coming of full age neglects to sue within the time limited, his neglect
though it will create a bar against himself, will not prejudice the others, since
each one has a separate right of action. Borrow‘s Lessee v. Nave, 2 Yerg. 2271
§ 230. And see Turner v. Lumbrick, Meigs R. 7,13. And this rule is of equal ap
plication where the disability of one or more is by coverture. Johnson v. Harris
§ 5 Hayw. 113.
But in personal actions, there is only a joint right of action; all must join in

the suit, and if one be barred, all are barred. - Bar-row‘s Lessee v. Nave, 2 Yerg.
§ 227,238; Morgan v. Reed, 2 Head, 276,285; Shute v. Wade, 5 Yerg. 1, 9. But
if all were under age when the right of action accrued, the Act of 1715, ch. 27,
§ 9, by its terms did not bar any, until three years after all became of full age.
Shut-e v. Wade, 5 Yerg. 1, 9; Wells v. Ragland, 1 Swan, 501,505.
But if there has been a severance of the joint interest, as by payment to one
of his share, (Parker v. Elder, 11 Humph. 546,) or by the sale of one of his in
terest, the severance operates as to all, each may sue for his share, and the par
ties, it would seem, are remitted to the same position in regard to the Statute of
Liinitations, as tenants in common of realty. Morgan v. Reed, 2 Head, 276, 285.

Note.

In that case, all the ﬁve complainants were under age when the cause of

action accrued, and two were still under age when the bill was ﬁled. It does not
appear from the report whether any of the other three had come of age more
than three years before the ﬁling of the bill, or not. It was_held that all were
within the equity of the statute.
(c) Imbecility from extreme old age brings a party within this exception.
Porter v. Porter, 3 Humph. 586.
(d) Where a husband acquires land in right of his wife, which he conveys
during the coverture, without her joiningin the conveyance, his conveyance only
operates to pass his interest; the vendee does not hold adversely to the wife,
but in privity with her, while the coverture lasts, and the statute does not begin
to run against her until the death of the husband, and then she has seven years in
which to bring suit. Miller v. Miller, Meigs R. 484,491 ; Corry v. King’s Heirs,
§ 8 Humph. 267,274 ; Weisinger v. Murphy, 2 Head, 674.
But this rule is based on the principle that the wife’s right of action does not
fall or accrue until the death of the husband; since the husband is estopped
from suing by his deed,nnd the wife could only sue jointly with him. But,as by the

marriage the husband and wife become jointly seized of the wife's estate, and
in case of a dissetlsin, where the husband is not estopped, have a joint right of
action, the statute begins to run against their estate from the time of the dis

seisin. and the wife surviving, must sue within three yearstrom her disooverture
according to the terms of the statute; since her right of action did not fall or
accrue at the husband's death,but at the time of the commencement of the adverse

possession. Guion v. Anderson, 8 Humph. 298; Weisinger v. Murphy, 2 Head,
§ 674; Mc(.‘-lung v. Snead, 8 Head, 218; Murdock v. Johnson, IS., Jackson, spe
cial Nov. Term, 1867, cited in King's Digest, Vol. 3, p. 278.
(e) By the Act. of 1827, ch. 75, the words “ beyond mu " in any of the statutes

of limitation then in force in this State, were held to mean beyond the limits
of the United States. In Pike v. Green, 1 Yerg. 465-a case Originating before
the above Act, but decided afterwards, in 1831—it was held on general grounds
in a forcible and caustic opinion by Catron, J., that a State line is not a “ sea,‘
and that aperson living in a neighboring State is not “beyond seas" with respect

to this State. But the contrary doctrine has obtained in the Supreme Court of
the United States. Murray v. Baker, 3 Wheat. 541 ; Shelby v. Gay, 11 Wheat.

§ 361; Bank of Alexandria v. Dyer, 14 Pet. 141 ; Peck v. Pease, 5 McLean,
§ 486.
Oman Excnrrious. It has been established by a long series of decisions that
the Legislature having made certain speciﬁc exceptions to the operation of the
statute, the Courts can make no other. Guiou v. Bradley Academy,4 Yerg. 253;
Cocks 8: Jack v. McGinnis,Mart. 8; Yerg. 361: Lawrence v. Bridleman, 3 Yerg.
§ 496; Craighead v. The Bank, 7 Yerg. 399; Stone v. Saunders, 1 Head, 248; Clark
v. Chase, 5 Sneed, 636.

To this rule, however, there are some exceptions in

equity, as to which, we note to 2761.

Act of 1819, ch. 28, § 1, 2nd proviso. For example; If the party be an infant
when his right of action accrues, and afterwards, but before he comes of full age,

after attaining his majority as though he had continued of sound mind. See

the creditor was barred unless he brought suit within two years after the quali.

Acts of 1819, ch. %, § 1,ﬁ2-at clause: Acts of 1797, eh. 43, Q 4; 1715, ch. 27,
Q Q 2, 3. An able summary of the history of this legislation will be found in Meig‘s
Digest, Vol. 2, p. 744, ct seq; and in King’s Digest, Vol. 3, p. 267, et seq. The

act of 1819 was intended to quiet the contests which had arisen upon the proper
construction of the acts of 1715 and 1797. The extent to which the general re
pealing clause, (§ 4,) of the act oi‘ 1819, ropeals the acts of 1715 and 1797 will
be found discussed and settled in Campbell v. Crocker, 8 Yerg. 225, 230. This

and the following section of the code are modeled upon § 1 of the act of 1819,
without substantial variance.

The acts of 1715 and 1797, so far asleft unrepcal.

ed by the act of 1819, are now abrogated by the general repealing clause of the

code, 3 41.
(a) Thus the possession of a vendor and his vendee may be united so as to
make a continuous possession, if the possession is consistent and under the same

title.

Napeir v. Simpson, 1 Tenn- 448.

And see Graham v. Nelson, 5 Humph_

§ 605, 608.
But the successive possession of trespascrs cannot be thus connected; there
can be no privity between wrong doers.

And this doctrine applies both to real

and personal property. Motfet v. McDonald, 11 Humph. 457, 462 ; Clark v. Chase,
§ 5 Sneed, 636; Hobbs v. Ballard, 5 Yerg. 395, 405; Wells v. Ragland, 1 Swan,

(e) “ Granted," etc. The statute does not run until there is a grant of land
from the State; for until there is a grant the title is in the state, and the statute
does not run against the State. Singleton v. Ake, 3 Humph. 626, 628. See 2762.
The act of 1819 does not apply to grants made by Indian treaties, in the form

of reservations, or to school sections, [See 2766,] or to grants by Virginia, and es
pecially by Kentucky, west of Cumberland mountain and east of Tennessee River,
lying south of Walker's line, but north 0!‘ thirty degrees thirty minutes north lati

In Cockc’s Lessee v. Dodson 81. Finley, 1 Tenn. 169, 171, it was held that pos
session under a void grant, as of lands within the Indian boundary prohibited from
appropriation, would not be protected by the statute. Land is “granted” from

In such cases this statute not only protects the possession, but confers on the
possessor “a good and indefeasible title in fee"; and in this respect is to be distin

guished from section 2765, which was founded on the second section of the act of
§ 1819, and which protects the possession only, by barring the remedy of the party

out of possession, without destroying his right. See Wallace v. Hannum, 1 Humph

this tatute, a naked trespasser, without “ color of title," is protected in his
possession; but he acquires no right of property, nor is the right of the true

owner extinguished, though his remedy is barred, so long as the trespasser con
tinues to hold. Dyche v. Gass, 3 Yerg. 397 ; Campbell v. Crockett, 8 Yerg. 225,

But, as there can be no privity between wrong doers, (see note (a) to 2768,)
:1 naked trespasser holding under the protection of this statute, mmnot transmit
his possessory right to another, who comes in under him to hold for himself, so
as to enable the latter to couple his possession with the former, and gain the beneﬁt of the statute. Hammett v. Blount, 1 Swan, 385,386. Such possession is
not alienable, or descendable, or liable to execution. Crntzinger v. Catroii, 10

Or where he, as landlord holds by several
successive tenants. Sims v. Eastland, 3 Head, 868.
But a trespssser without color of title is protected only to the extent of his act_
ml enclosures; and he must have had an actual occupancy to that extent for the
whole term of seven years, deﬁnite. positive and notorious. Dyche v. Gass, 3

The effect of the adverse holding of personalty witha

claim of right, under this statute, is similar to that of realty under the ﬁrst sec

the party dispossessed of the personalty, but it vests an absolute title in the pos
sessor. Keglcr v. Miles, Mart. 81 Yerg. 426 ; Partee v. Badgett,-1 Yerg. 174; Tur

See 2279. The act of 1831, ch. 23, (§ 2274,) pro

hibits suits against personal representatives until six months after their qualiti

cation.

Uuder these acts, before the Code, it was licldthat the creditor must

sue within two years after the qualiﬁcation of the personal representative, or with

in eighteen months after he became liable to suits. Greenway v. Hunter, Meigs,
§ 73. But it is now held as the proper construction of this statue in connection with § 2760, that the creditor may sue within two years after the personal repre
sentative becomes liable to suits, or within two years and six months after his

qualiﬁcation. Maynard v. May, 2 Cold. 44.
If the personal representative dies within the six months during which he is
not liable to suit, and another is appointed, the statute only begins to run

from the qualiﬁcation of the second. Atkinson v. Brooks, 10 Yerg.484.

See

Coleman v. Raynor, 8 Cold. 25.

On claims not due st the time of the qualiﬁcation of the personal representa

there has been a recovery against a sheritf for the misfeasance of his deputy, and
the deputy is dead, the sheriﬂ' must bring his action on the deputies bond against
the personal representative of the deputy within the time limited after the recovery
against himself. Atkins v. Scarborough, 9 Humph. 517.
If the personal representative is a creditor, he must prosecute his claim within

the time limited, or he will be barred the same as any other creditor.

Act

The proper criterion seems to be, that the causes of action set forth in the
several counts are of the same nature, and require at common law the same judg
ment, a capiatur, or a miaericordia, although the pleas may be different; as in
debt on judgment, on specialty and on simple contract, which may all be joined
in one action, though the plea to each may be different. McKinney, J., in Trus

tees v. Rcneau, 2 Swan, 94, 97, citing Chit. Pl. 200; Gould Pl. §§ 79-99
Therefore, where there are several bonds, some of tne obligors being the same
in all, the plaintiff may sue in one action all the common obligors, but by dif
ferent counts upon the different bonds, omitting to sue those obligors who are
not common to all the bonds. 2 Swan, 94, 99.
The Act of 1837, ch. 5, gave the joint right of action against the drawer or

maker, and endorsers of a bill of exchange or prommissory note for the ﬁrst time.
It is held as the proper construction of this statute, that the plaintiﬂ‘ cannot
bring his action against the drawer or maker, and then dismiss, or suffer his ac_
lion to abate, as to the drawer or maker and proceed against the cndorser alone.
The Bank v. Cowan, 11 Humph. 126; Holland v. Harris, 2 Sneed, 68, 71. The

reason assigned for the rule, in the Bank v. Cowan, which was an action of debt
was, that debt would not lie against an cndorser alone. But that was before forms
of action were abolished by the Code. (See 2746, ct seq, 2869.) Another reason

given in the same case, and which is still applicable, was that by the Act of 1820,
ch. 151, § 6, (See 3028,) the cndorser is entitled to have the demand ﬁrst satis
ﬁed out of the property of the maker or drawer, if such can be found.
The maker and endorsers of a prommissory note, cannot be jointly sued with
a guarantor whose guaranty is written on a separate paper. Eakin v- Burger, 1
Sneed, 417. And see Kannon \'. Neely, 10 Humph. 288, 290.

These statutes do not authorize a suit by a ﬁrm composed of A, and B, upon a
note given by them to a ﬁrm composed of B and C; since B cannot sue himself;

nor can B and C sue A alone; because on the face of the paper, A must be en.
titled to half the recovery. It is a case for equity. Banks v. Mitchell, 8 Yerg.
§ 111.

The resident joint debtor may be sued by summons, and the non-resident may
at the same time be proceeded against by original attachment in another court.

original obligors, and all or any part of the representatives
of deceased obligors, as if such obligations and assumptions
were joint and several.
Act of 1789, ch. 57, § 5. The necessary effect of this enactment is to give the
joint creditors the same remedies at law, which they before had in equity, against
the estate of the deceased partner. They may proceed to obtain judgment
against the survivor and representative of the deceased partner jointly, or, at their election, against either sc-paratcl_v. So, they may proceed to enforce a sat
isfaction against either. Saunders v. Wilder, 2 Head, 578, 580.
And where the surviving partner is administrator ofthe deceased partner, he
may be sued in both characters. Taylor v. Taylor 5 Humph. 110; Trundle v.

representative, de bani; latatorllr, or intestali. Greer v. Miller, 2 Tenn. 187;

After ajoint action commenced, the plaintiff cannot drop some who are liable
and proceed against the rost; and if one die, the law is not that there may, but
that there must be a revivor against his personal representatives. Greer v. Mil.

[Act 1825, ch. 29, §].]
See
§ 2858, 3200, 3810. Plea of non assegnavit‘, Q 2909, note.
This section, together with {Q 1956, 1967, and 2858,and the orignal Acts from

which they were drawn are compared, and their effect stated in Wolfe v. Tyler, l
Heisk. 315-16. [The note in this case was not payable to bearer, as inadvertently
stated on page 919, ante, note to Q 1967.] The Act of 1825 was not designed to
introduce any new rule of practice in respect of the mode of bringing suit by the

assiguee of :1 chose in action in a court of law.

The ancient rule of the common

law had long before been departed from; and the principle had been well estab
lished, both in England and the United States, that courts of law would give that
protection to the assignee of an equitable interest, which anciently, could only
have been obtained in a court of equity. The Act had but two objects: First to

subject the party having the beneﬁcial interest to liability for costs, [Q 8200] ;
and, secondly to prevent the death of the nominal plaintiff from working an abate
ment, or requiring the suit to be revived in the name of his personal representa
tive. It does not apply to courts of equity. Morrison v. Deaderick, 10 Humph.
§ 342, 344.

Suit must be brought in name of legal owner.—An action on a contract must
be brought in the name of the party in whom the legal interest is vested. Cocko
v. Dickens, 4 Yerg. 29, 84; Rutherford v. Mitchell, Mart. dz Yerg. 261 ; Smyth v.
Carclen, 1 Swan, 28, 29. In a court of law, whether the contract be express or
implied, or whether it be by parol, or under seal, or of record, the suit must be
brought in the name of the person in whom the legal interest is vested. Fall
wickle v. Keith, 1 Heisl-8. 860, 362. This technical rule is of universal application

in the legal forum.

Guinther v. Gerding, 3 Head, 197, 199.

But, under the Act

of 1801, ch. 6, § 54, [sup1'a, Q 1967,] the assignee of certain unnegotiable instru
ments may sue in his own name. Looney v. Pinckston, 1 Tenn. 883, 385. As
was done in Lawrence v. Dougherty, 5 Yerg. 435, and Moore v. Weir, 3 Sneed, 46.
Or he may sue in the name of the obligee or payee for his beneﬁt. McGee v.
Lynch, 8 Hayw. 105; Trezevant v. lticNeal, 2 Humph. 352. And this although
the legal interest is transferred to the person named in the assignment, who is

the nominal plaintiff.

Ib.

[This last ruling, founded on New York decisions,

seems not to be sustained by our other cases.

Eds.]

E1:ample:.—'l‘he owner of n. bill single to whom it has come without assign~
ment, cannot recover in his own name. Nelson v. Marley, 2 Yerg. 576. Nor
where the assignment has been made without authority, as by a partner after dis
solution. Dickerson v. Wheeler, 1 Humph. 51. Nor where it is endorsed by the payee to one who passes it to the plaintiff with a separate written guaranty, but

without an endorsement. Eakin v. Burger, 1 Sneed, 417, 422. Nor where a
note, drawn in favor of a person as agent, is endorsed by his principal to a
third party.

Cooke v. Dickens, 4 Yerg. 29, 34.

In such a case, the suit should

be in the name of the agent for the use of the assignee.

Ib.

And in Hackney

v. Jones, 3 Humph. 612, where the instrnrnent in question was without negotia

ble words, and not assignable under the Act of 1801, [5 1967,] it was held that
the endorsement of the same to a third person for value by the drawee, passed noin
terest whatever to the ondorsee; and the drnwee being an agent merely, his prin~
cipal could sue on the original consideration. But in Wolfe v. Tyler, 1 Heisk.
§ 813, where the instrument sued on wasa note payable in current bank notes, not
payable to bearer, and had not been assigned to the holder, and the holder sued
in his own name, and the defendant pleaded generally nan est factum, Will] repli
cation and issue, it was held that the omission to make the payee nominal plain

tiﬂ‘ was matter of form, not in issue under the plea of non est factum, cured by
verdict, and not fatal in arrest of judgment. But if a note or bill is payable to
bearer, it may be transferred by mere delivery without endorsement, so as to vest
the legal title in the holder, and enable him to sue thereon in his own name_
Smyth v. Garden, 1 Swan, 28, 29. If, however, his right be contested or denied,

he must show that he came by the bill or note bona ﬁcle, and for a valuable con
sideration.

Ib.

If the payee of a note or bill payable to himself or bearer, trans

fer it by endorsement, he will incur the ordinary liability of an endorser, but if by
mere delivery, then he will cease to be deemed aparty to the note or bill. lb.
Therefore, where the payee of a note which is made payable to himself or bearer,
transfers it by mere delivery, he thereby divests himself of all right to it, ceases
to be a party to it, and the holder must sue in his own name, and cannot sue in
the name of the payee to his use. Ib. But where suit is brought in this rnauner,
the papers may be amended by striking out the name of the nominal plaintiﬂ‘. Ib.
But in Burk v. The Bank, it was hold, without citing the above case, that the

objection that the person for whose use the suit was brought was the legal owner
of the note, and therefore could only suein his own name, had nothing in it; for

whether the beneﬁcial interest lay in the real or nominal plaintiﬂ was a matter
with which the defendant had nothing to do; it did not affect his liability; and
in either event, he was protected by a recovery on the note. But in Erwin v..
Rutherford, 1 Yerg. 169, 176, the court say that the defendant is compellable to
pay to the equitable plaintiff, after notice fumished by the record of his benefi
cial interest ; and if he should pay the nominal plaintiff, it would be a payment in
his own wrong, and he would be compelled to pay over again to the rightful par

ty, tho assignee. And it seems from the earlier case of Oowan v. Shields, 1
Tenn., 814, that satisfaction of a judgment by the nominal plaintiff, the defendant
having notice of the beneﬁcial interest of a third party by assignment, will be set
aside in equity.
For, the name of the nominal plaintiff, under the statute, is merely used to
preserve form; he has no power to control or dismiss the suit, nor, [by Q 2858,]
‘ ' would it abate on his death. Burton v. Dees, 4 Yerg. 4, 6, 7. The nominal

plaintiff not being subjected to costs.

Ib., Q 8200.

And this form is a mere‘

shadow, and the courts have taken care that it shall never work injustice. Bul
ler, J., in 4 Term, 341; quoted approvingly in 1 Yerg. 175. Nevertheless it is
said in Neilgon v_ Gilliam, '7 Yerg. 474, where one party paid the debt of another,
and the creditor then sued the debtor to the use of the party advancing the money,
' that the nominal plaintiff was the plaintiff in fact, and that it was a mistake to
suppose that the bcneﬁciarywas the real plaintiﬁ‘.—And an execution issued in

favor of the beneﬁcial plaintiff alone will be quashed. It must conform to the judgment, and be issued in favor of the nominal plaintiﬂ‘ for the use of the beneﬁciary. "W skint!!!
Jennings v. Pray, 8 Yerg. 85, 88.
Suit may be brought in W name of one person for the use of another, on a
negotiable instrument, as well as on an instrument not negotiable. Vincent v.

Groom, 1 Yexg. 430.

The contrary dictum in West. v. McClure, Peck, 206, was a.

more speculative doubt, never intended or recognized as authority. Ib.

Or on

an account assigned by the creditor. Mt. Olivet Cemetery Co. v. Shubert, 2 Head,
§ 116, 120.

Or on a verbal or implied promise; as where the owner of a negro paid

the physic.ian's bill charged to the hirer, and sued in the name of the physician for
his use. Neilson v. Gilliam, 7 Yerg. 474. And so where a lessor took A cove
nant l'or rent payable to a third person for his own use, and afterwards assigned

the rent to a different person, it was held that the assignee of the rents might sue
the lessee in the name of the lessor to his use, but not in his own name. Haney
v. Byrd, ll Humph. 96. The right of one person to sue in the name of another
does not extend to detinue for speciﬁc chattels.

Thus, where one of several execu.

tors sold certain slaves, without registered bill of sale, so as to pass the legal title,
and afterwards another executor sold the same slaves to another person by reg
istered bill of sale, it was held that the ﬁrst vendee could not bring detinue for the

slaves against the second, in the name of the executors to his use.
for equity.

It was a case

Smith v. Mabry, 9 Yerg. 318.

Right to sue in name of another-.—In case of unnegotiable instruments, the as
signee may sue the obligor in the name of the obligee, and a court of law will hin
der the latter from releasing the debt, or receiving the money or property, and

consider the debt as belonging to the assignee. McGee v. Lynch, 3 Hayw. ll5.
For, the word “ assign " implies a covenant or agreement that the assignee will
he permitted to receive the money, and that the assignor will not by any act of
his defeat him. Ib.; Lawrence v. Dougherty, 6 Yerg. 435, 438. But if the suit
is brought without proper authority it will be dismissed. Wright v. Mchemore.
l0 Yerg. 235. In this ease suit was brought inthe name of the joint obligees of a
bill single for the use of the assignee, to whom it had been assigned by one of the
obligees. One of the obligees refused to permit his name to be used on the ground
ofa failure of consideration, while the other made no objection. And in Smith
v. Russell, 1 Thompson‘s cases, 34, 36, where a guardian had left the State, it was
held that his wards might use his name without his express authority, to effect a
recovery to which they were equitably entitled. Sec Q 1967 and note. And tho

assignee of a chose in action has a. right to use the name of the person in whom the
legal interest is vested to recover his debt.

Johnson v. Irby, 8 Humph. 654.

Right to sue in name of another, how lested.—
§ 1. By plea of non asaignavit, which denies the ownership of the chose in ac

(ion; as to which, see note under Q 2909, where the distinction between this plea,
and non est factum by an endorser, is shown.
§ 2. By a. rule on the beneﬁciary plaintiﬂ' to show by what authority he uses the
name of the nominal plaintiﬂ‘. In such a. case the correct practice is, for the de
fendant to present his alﬁdavit, stating that the name of the nominal plaintiff has
been used without authority, and have a rule to show cause why the suit should
not be dismissed. Cage v. Foster, 6 Yerg. 261, 263,; Lynn v. Glidwcll, 8 Yerg.
§ 1; Wright v. Mchemore, 10 Yerg. 286. For the want of authority to use the
name of the nominal plaintitfcannot be taken advantage of by plea. 8Yerg. 1.
Nor is sucha question a proper one to be submitted to the jury. 6 Yerg. 263.
The application for the rule should be made attho ﬁrst term ; or if made at a sub
sequent term, the ailidavit must show a suﬂicient reason why it was not made
sooner. Wilson v. Turk, 10 Yerg.247. But where the original payee of a note

Odtcr defences.
§ 1. The defendant may plead that the chose in action for which the assignee
sues, was attached in another proceeding, as by bill in chancery, before the com
mencement of this suit. Johnson v. Irby, 8 Humph. 654. But it is a good repli

cation to such a plea, that before the attachment was sued out the chose in action
had been assigned to the beneﬁcial plaintiﬂl Ib.
§ 2. Where the original owner sues in his own name, it may be proved on the
trial, if before a justice, that he has transferred his right of action. Burton v.
Dees, 4 Yerg. 4.

If the suit originated in the Circuit Court, the fact ofsuch as

signment, it seems should be pleaded.

Trezevant v. McNeal, 2 Humph. 852.

If

the defendant succeeds in this defence, the suit abates, and forms no bar to a
second action on the note, brought by the real owner in the name of the payee—

the present plaintiff, for his beneﬁt. Ib. See Chit. PL p. 16, note 1 ; 10 Johns.
§ 400; Ib., 488. [Mn Heiskell quotes Burton v. Does as deciding on thelast point
the reverse of the above, and quotes the above authorities as holding the contrary;

whereas they are in accord.

Eds.]

If the fact that the plaintif assigned to an

other before suit the obligation sued on, and therefore has no right to sue, be
pleaded, a demurrer to the plea admits the fact, and defeats the suit. 2 Humph.

§ 353. But a replication that the suit is prosecuted for the beneﬁt of the legal
owner, would, itis said, be a good answer to such a plea. Ib. And see Hackney
v. Jones, 3 Humph. 612; Burk v. Bonner, 3 Head, 686.

But if the note is paya

ble to bearer, the bona ﬁde holder is the legal owner, and must sue in his own
name, and cannot sue in the name of the payee for his use.

Before this Act, an amendment making a new party plaintiff was not allowable
by any of our statutes of amendment. Wray v. Jamison, 10 Humph. 186. Thus,

where suit was brought in the name of Jones, receiver of the accounts of Wray
and Price, it was held error to strike out the name of Jones, receiver, etc., and

leave the suit in behalf of Wray and Price alone. Ib. And an amendment ad
ding a new defendant was held to be wholly unauthorized, and ground of revers
ing judgment. Ib. And in Smyth v. Garden, 1 Swan, 28, it was said that an
amendment adding new parties cannot, in general, be made; citing two cases,
but not much to the point. But in this case, which was a suit brought upon a
note payable to the bearer, by the holder, in the name of the payee for his use, it
was held propcrto strike out the name of the nominal plaintiﬂ‘ and to leave the suit
in the name of the holder, who was the legal owner, and in whose name alone the
suit could be brought; for this would not have the effect of making a new party_
And to refuse this amendment was error. But the Supreme Court in such a. case
would not make the amendment, but would remand to amend, as the amendment
might necessitate some new defence. 1 Swan, 30. And where the assignee of a
note not payable tobearer, which had come into his hands by purchase, but with
out written assignment, brought suit thereon in his own name, it was held that he
could not amend by inserting the original payee‘s name as nominal plaintiff; for
without a written assignment, he could show no legal title to the note. Nelson
v. Marley, 2 Yerg, 676. But ‘it was permitted in one case to introduce into the
declaration the name of amember of the ﬁrm who were plaintA'ﬂ's, even after ver
dict, but it docs not distinctly appear that this added a new party. Floyd v.
Woods,-1 Yerg. 165. And this ruling was cited approvingly by Green, J., in a dis

Smyth v. Garden, ut supra, that where a suit was prosecuted in the name of one

And where in a suit commenced be

terwards the (ﬁrcuit Court refused to permit the sumume to be inserted by way of
amendment, this was held error and ground of reversal.

And it was error to refuse to amend by adding words which were merely

descriptive of the person, as “administrator of the estate of Thomas Payne, de

But undz-rllu abovv Act, the court is bound to allow amendments making
proper parties. But parties defendant can only be added against whom suit can
legally be maintained. Thus the court, under this statute, cannot permit an
amendment adding as defendant an administrator who has suggested to the
proper authority the insolvency of his intestute’s estate ; for such a suggestion
operates as an injunction against all further suits; and this would be equivalent
to bringing 0. suit against him. The Bank v. Skillern, 2 Sneed, 698, 700. See
QQ 2332, 2333, 2383. For, an order of court granting leave to make a new de
fendant is the commencement of a suit against such defendant, and supplemental
process must be taken out against him. Jones v. Cloud, 2 Cold. 236, 241. And
this must be done in the language of the statute “so as especially to prevent de
lay." Hence the supplemental process must be taken out at the term at which
the order is made; and if this is not done, it works a discontinuance as to the
party sought to be added; and supplemental process taken out at n succeeding
term without reviving the order permitting the amendment, is a mere nullity. Ib.
An amendment adding new parties plaintiif, made at the trial and after the em
pannelling of the jury, is not ground of reversal, unless it appear that the defend
ants were prejudiced thereby. Brazelton v. Turney, 7 Cold. 269, 270-71. If a
woman, relatorin a bastardy ease, marry pending an appeal, it is proper to make
her husband a party by amendment. 0‘I\'eal v. State, 2 Sneed, 215, 219. And
where a suit by motion had been brought in the name of a chairman of a county

court, and pending the same a new chairman was elected, it was proper to allow
the substitution of the new chairman as plaintiff by way of amendment.

§ 2799. In actions for the recovery of property, apy person
not a party thereto, on showing hnnself interested 1!] the sub
ject-mattcr of the suit, may be allowed to appear as defendant

substitute

therein.
§ 2800. At any time before defence made, the defendant

may apply to the court or justice to substitute in his place any person, not already a party, who claims the money or property
'

in suit, by ﬁling his aﬁidavit, stating the facts on which he
founds his application, showing that the right in the subject
matter in controversy is in such third person, that he (aﬁiant)
has no interest in the suit, and may be exposed to the claim
of two or more adverse parties, denying all collusion with the

person sought to be substituted, and proifering to pay the
money, or deliver the property into the custody of the court.
If, on notice to the plaintiff and the person sought to be sub
stituted as defendant, suﬂicient cause be shown, the court may
order the substitution and discharge the original defendant
from liability to either party, and make such disposition, pend

the money, property or its value, to the party who shall prove

§ 2802. A father, or, in case of his death or desertion of his
fainily, the mother, may bring a suit for the seduction of a
daughter, although such daughter be not living with nor in
the service of the pla.intiﬁ', and though there be no loss of ser
vice. But a recovery in one suit, by the father, mother, or

daughter, shall be a bar to all other actions for the same cause.
[Ala. Code of 1852, § 2134.]
As to the form of action before the Code, in a suit by a parent for the seduc
duction of a daughter, the distinction between trespass and case is stated in Parker
v. Meek, 3 Sneed, 29, 32. Thus: in trespass vi at armin, the nominal ground of
recovery was the breaking into the defendant's house or trespass on his premises,
and the seduction of his daughter and consequent loss of her service, were given

in evidence in aggravation of damages. Hence, this action could not be main
tained unless the dunghter were living with the plaintiﬂ‘ at the time of the
injury. But in case, which was founded simply upon the injury consequent
upon the seduction, it was immaterial whether the daughter were living with the
plaintiff at the time of the injury, or not. These grounds as respects theform
of action, namely, the trespass in the one case, and the loss of service in the

other, were merely ﬁctitious: the real gravamm was the private injury to the
family and person of the seduced.

Ib.; Maguinay v. Saudek, 5 Sneed, 146, 149.

Even where the action was trespass, it was held in Wallace v. Clark, 2 Tenn. 93,
to be immaterial where the seduction happened, so it appear that she rendered
some slight service to her father. These distinctions were obliterated by the
Code, which abolished forms of action [xupra, Q 2746,] and gave in such cases ‘f an

action on the facts of the case" [Q 2747.]

“lhen the action was case—.and o

fortirrri now that the form is immatcrial—-proof of service was unnecessary,

whether the daughter were a minor or of full age, or whether she were living at
home or abroad. 8 Sneed, 37; followed in part in 6 Sneed, 149. The action
may be maintained by the father, mother or any person standing in loco parmlis.
§ 8 Sneed, 37; 6 Sneed, 149. Thus, a step-father who has received his wife‘s
daughter into his family, assumes the relation of father towards her, and may
maintain an action for her seduction ; and such action is governed by the same
principles and rules of evidence as if it were by the father. 5 Sneed, 148. And
if there be any just ground for discrimination as respects the quantum of dam
ages growing out of the particular circumstances of the case, this will he left to
the discretion of the court and jury. Ib., 149. And where the father was living
at the time of the seduction, but died before the birth of the child, and the
daughter lived with the mother until after the birth of the child, it was held that
the mother might maintain the action.

§ 8 Sneed, 38.

As to the kind ofproof on the part of the defendant which will be admitted or
excluded, where the father sues in case for the seduction ofhis daughter see Reed
v. Williams, 5 Sneed, 582; Lea v. Henderson, 1 Cold. 146; note, in 4 King Dig.
p. 126; Maguinay v. Saudek, 5 Sneed, 146, 149-54; Wallace v. Clark, 2 Tenn.
§ 93; Sellars v. Kinder, 1 Head, 134. Evidence of payment of the allowance made
under the bastardy laws for the support of the child, or of a composition with
the seduced female; and a receipt in full from her, is irrelevant, when a parent

sues for the seduction of his daughter, and cannot even go in mitigation of dam
ages. 1 Head, 134. It was held in Johnson v. Goss, 2 Yerg. 110, and in Reed v.
Williams, 5 Sneed, 680, 582, that on the trial of such an action, the daughter
could not be interrogated as to whether she had carnal knowledge with other
men; for this would subject her to the penalties of the Act of 1841, ch. 14, § 9,

against fornication.

But that Act is omitted from the Code, and abrogated by

the general repealing clause, ante, Q 44.
Damayes discretionary with the jury. Goodall v. Thurman, 1 Head, 209. And

§ 2807 a. Section 2807 of the Code is hereby repealed.

[Act 1865, ch. 36, § 34.]
This Act was passed Julie 10, 1865. It did not, by its terms, take effect from its
passage. The session at which it was passed, was by joint resolution No. 61,
adjourned to the ﬁrst Monday in October, 1866, at which session the Acts known

as the Acts of 1865-6, were passed.

This adjourned session, by joint resolution,

No. 109, was again adjourned to the ﬁrst Monday in November, 1866, to adjourn
sine die on the 10th of December, 1866 ; but this session, which passed the Acts
known as the Acts of 1866-7, did not ﬁnally adjourn until March 11, 1867. See
Acts of l866—7,joiut resolution No. 92. Hence, according to the doctrine of Day
v. McGinnis, 1 Heisk. 310, the above Act did not take effect, and the State continu

It must be brought in the county where the

the county where the action is brought, would be evidence that he was there.
Childress v. Perkins, Cooke, 8'7. See,§ 2831, and note. Hence, if the sheriff return non est invenhu, and that the defendant resides in another county, it is not

proper to award an alias to that county; nor can the plaintiff have a. judicial at»

ty or Circuit Courts. Bennett v. State, Mart. 81 Yerg. 133. Sigiing is all that is re
quired. Const. of Tenn. Art. 6, Q 12 ; Car. Lawsuit, § 61. But under the old
Act of_1794, ch. 1, {24, which required attachments to be sealed by the justice
granting them, it was held that an attachment issued by a justice without his seal

was void. HeC!lloch v. Foster, 4 Yerg. 162 ; Walker v. Wynne, 3 Yerg. 62, 72
§ 8. And in Taekett v. State, 4 Yerg. 392, it was held that a magistrate's warrant
of arrest, not having his seal, was a nullity. In this case the defendant had been

convicted of murder in killing an oﬂieer who attempted to arrest him under a
magistrate’a warrant without seal ; and the judgment was reversed on the ground
that the process was a nullity ; and this was declared to be the common law of
this county. But now private seals are abolished, § 1804 ; and there is no provi
sion in the Code requiring process, civil or criminal, to be sealed with the seal of

the oflicer issuing it.

See also Q 4040, sub-sec. 1 ; § 4098, sub-sec. 1. The date of a writ is the ‘day
of its issuing, endorsed on the back. Reed v. Brewer, Peck, 275. This endorse
ment is also the real commencement of the suit for the purpose of computing time
under the statute of limitations ; and is therefore as much a matter of record as
the writ itself. Ib. And it seems that this “ legal and necessary endorsement ” is

evidence on plea in abatement, of the date of issuance of the writ.

Helm v. Rogers,

§ 5 Humph. 105. But the lien of an execution is from the date of its test, and not
from the date of its issuance as endorsed by the clerk. Q 2980, and note.

In Carutl|er’a Lawsuit, Q 53, it is said that the above section of the Code sanc
tions what has long been a practice in this State, namely, for the clerk to furnish
attorneys with blank writs signed by the clerk ; so that when an attorney wants
to commence a suit, he takes a prosecution bond, and ﬁlls up the writ himself.
In this case he acts as the special deputy of the clerk, and he must endorse on the
writ the day of issuance, and perform whatever other duties devolve on the clerk

in the matter.

He deposits the prosecution bond with the clerk.

It is to be ob

served that there is nothing in our statute law requiring clerks to pursue this loose
practice; and some clerks have discontinued it. It places the taking of security
for costs in the hands of the attorney, who is interested in bringing the suit, and
not interested in taking good security; and in this way the oﬂicers of the court
are frequently defeated of their costs. The above section follows without substan
tial variation the language of the original Act of 1794. By that Act the Territory
of Tennessee was divided into three judicial districts only,—namely, Washington,
Hamilton and Moro. It is probable that attomeys frequently resided at great dis
tance from the seat of justice of their district ; and hence this practice at that day
may have been highly convenient and necessary. For a striking picture of the
difference between the administration of justice in those days and these, see the
opinion of Judge Peck in Cox v. Breedlove, 2 Yerg. 518, 519.

Car. Lawsuit, § 81.

§ 2521. Wl18l‘8 there are two or more defendants in any

the plaintiff. may cause counterpart summons or subpoena to

be issued to any county where any of the defendants are most Come,-,,,,,

likely to be found, the fact that the counterpart process is is
sued in the same suit being noted on each process, which, when

returned, shall be docketed as if only one process had issued.
If the defendants are not served, the same proceedings shall be
had as in cases of other similar process not executed.
[Act 1820, ch. 25, § 3.]
As to counterpart writs of attachment, see R 3464, 8465. This section so far
modiﬁes the orignal act from which it seems to have been drawn, that it is per
haps well to quote the original act in full. “In all cases where a. suit may be re

quired to he brought against two or more defendants, in any one of the courts of
this State, who reside in different counties, it shall be lawful for the clerk of such
court, and he is hereby required to issue a writ directed to his county, in which

one of said defendants may reside, and on application, to issue a counterpart or
counterparts of such writ to the sheriﬁ' of su_ch county where the other defendants
may reside; which when executed and returned shall constitutea part of the
original writ or leading process of such suit in the court in which the same may

be retumable: Provided, nothing in this section contained shall be so construed
as to authorize suits to be brought in a county where neither of said defendants
do in fact reside, nor so construed as to authorize suits which are local in their na
ture, to be brought in a diﬁ‘erent county than that which is now required by law;
but the same may be abated upon the plea of the defendant."

[Act1S20, ch. 2'5 & 3.]
Before this statute, it was said, construing the Act of 1809, ch. 12, Q 3, [sup-a,
Q 2808,] which applied both to legal and equitable proceedings, that suit may be
brought in any circuit where the defendants may happen to be found, so as to

have process served on them; and where there are several defendants, if proper
process be served on any material one, process from the same court may issue to
the sheriff of any other circuit. Newnan v. Stewart, Cooke, 389, 841. See Q
§ 2808, and note; and for the rule in chancery suits, see Q 4305, and note, and Q

§ 4306, and note. It will be observed that the eases there cited do not require that
the “ material defendant " who is served in the county where suit is brought shall
actually reside there.
But under the original Act, 1820, ch. 25, Q 3, it has been held that if the de.

fondant served in the county where suit was brought was a non-resident, the court
did not acquirejurisdiction of the parties summoned by counterpart. Shelby v. Col
lins, 7 Hnmph. 503. For the statute did not intend that jurisdiction should be drawn
to a county where the defendant upon whom the leading process or original writ was
executed, did not in fact reside. Rich v. Rnyle, 2 Hnmph. 404, 407. In the form
er of these two cases, the leading defendant, maker of the note sued on, was a

resident of Arkansas, but was sued in Shelby county, where he happened to be
at the time; and another defendant, an endorssr was served with a counterpart
summons in Davidson county. He appeared by attorney, and pleaded in abate

ment. It was not controrerted that under the statute the subject matter of the
plea was suﬁicient to abate the process; but it was held that the privilege of being
impleaded in the venue of his residence was a personal one, and that in appearing

by attorney itwas waived. 7 Hnmph. 505-6. See Q 2812, and note.

In the latter

case six defendants were joined in trespass, three of whom resided in the county

of the venue, and the other, three residents of another county, were summoned by,
counterpart writs. The three former pleaded not guilty. The threelntter pleaded
in abatement that they were residents in, and citizens of the county of Grainger at
and before the issuance of the writ ; that the alleged cause ofaction took place, ifat
all, in that county, and that the principal defendants were citizens of the county of
Jefferson, and resident therein, and were not guilty, nor had any participation in the
alleged cause of action, but that the writ against them was issued falsely and fraudu
lently in order to draw the alleged cause of action within the Circuit Court for Jef
ferson county, and to cause the said defendants, citizens of Grainger county, to be

there impleadcd.

This plea was held bad on demurrer ; trial was had on the merits,

and judgment rendered in favor of the three leading defendants, residents of the
county of the venue, and against the three who had been broughtin by counter

part writ. This ruling and judgment the Supreme Court ailirmed. 2 Humph. 404,
§ 408. But in Yancy v. Marriott where two persons were jointly sued, the one in
the county of his residence, and the other by counterpart writ, and a nolls prosequi
was entered as to the original defendant, it was held that this circumstance was
suﬂicient to abate the suit; but it could only be taken advantage of by plea in
abatement, and not by motion to dismiss. 1 Sneed 28, 40. The court say: “It
will not do to hold that under this Act, the mere fact that the summons is served
upon some resident of the county where the suit is brought, who is made defend
ant and discharged before trial, will give jurisdiction to the court against the res
ident of another county, who is brought here by counterpart. If this were so,
there would be no difficulty in any case, in drawing a man out of the jurisdiction

where he has a right to be tried, no matter to what inconvenience, and hardship
it might subject him and his witnesses. It was the intention of the Legislature to
save the expense and trouble of a multiplicity of suits in the same cause of action,
by bringing all the parties into the county where one of the material defendants
might reside.” Ib.

§ 2823. In‘ joint actions on negotiable paper, service of a
counterpart writ on the drawer or maker shall not be suﬂicient
service to hold him to answer the action, unless the original
writ shall have been executed on a joint drawer or maker.

[Act 1827, ch. 75, § 2.]
This statute was intended to correct an abuse which_had grown up of the nomi
nal endorsement of negotiable paper, with a view to confer jurisdiction upon the
court of the county in which such nominal endorser resided, as against the real
parties to the paper instrument. Rich v. Rayle, 2 Humph. 404, 408; Bank of

Tennessee v. Anderson, 3 Sneed, 669, 671-2. This statute was not intended for
the beneﬁt of the eudorsers but of the drawer, who alone can take advantage of
it. If one of the endorsers resides in the county of the venue, this gives the
court jurisdiction by service of counter-part writs, over the other endorsers.

Therefore, a plea by an endorser that the original writ was served upon him and
the counter-part on the endorser is bad on demurrer. 3 Snecd, 678. Service.

Under the old statutes, 1794 ch. 1, Q 9; 1777, ch. 8, Q 6, and that above, and per

haps independently of them, the issuance of process on the Sabbath day is matter
in abatement of suit. Helm v. Rogers, 5 Humph. 105.

And see Q 2902, sub-sec.

§ 1. An averment in such plea that the process issued on the 15th of December,

the process issued on that date.

“ Allproms. "—Thus, executions; Q 8001.

And see the Constitution, Art. 6, §

§ 12. By the common law, the date of the term is the ﬁrst day; and from this pe
riod all its proceedings take effect by relation; and process is tested as of this day

Thus, the blanks in the form given in Q 2815, should not be ﬁlled out -with the
present date, but with the date ﬁxed bylaw for the commencement of the preced

ing term.

In point of fact, the writs in general use read, for instance, thus:

“Witness C. D. Clerk of said Court, the second Monday in January, 1871, [or

whatever the ﬁrst day of the preceding term may be.]
C. D. Clerk."
Notwithstanding the above sections, the attestation in the forms of process
given in various places in the Code read as though the blanks were intended
to be ﬁlled up with the date of issuance of the process. See form of sum
mons, Q 2815 ; of attachment, Q 3474; subpaana to answer in chancery, Q 4340.

And this was the understanding of the Supreme Court in case of the writ of at
tachment. For in Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 163, 162, it was objected that an an
cillary attachment was attested at tho foot of the process, as of the preceding
term, and not of the date of its issuance, in pursuance of the form proscribed in

§ 1 3474; and the court held that the proper attestation at the foot of the process
should be the date of its issuance; but as this date was endorsed on the back of
the writ in question, the test of the preceding term might be rejected as surplus
age. The forms of process given in our Code seem to he modeled after those of
the Alabama Code of 1852, which contains no provisions in regard to the test of
process; nor does the Constitution of Alabama of that date. The common‘ law
requires that every subsequent process shall be dated on the day of the return of

the preceding process.

If all the defendants in this action are not served with sum

§ 490. But in ordinary suits, even against two partners jointly sued, the suit may

other. Link v. Allen, 1 Heisk. 318. And sce Q 2790, and citations.
Where an infant is sued, he must he summoned, however young; even if he
were in. his cradle. Cur. Lawsuit,§ 57; citing Bac. Ab., Infancy, K. 2. But
Britain v. Cowen, 5 Humph. 315, 318, holds that service on n. general guardian
is sufficient, except in cases where some statute has expressly provided otherwise;
as where the infant‘s lands are subjected by u-ire faciaa to the payment of the
ancestor’s debts. See Q 2260 and note. And the doctrine of this case is re-af
ﬁrmed in Covran v. Anderson, 7 Cold. 284, 291-94. The case ofBritain v. Cowen
however, while long acquiesced in and recognized as authority, goes to the verge
of the law. The practice of serving process upon the guardian only is not to be
encouraged; and in cases where fraud is charged or suspected, in the proceedings
against the infant, the fact that the infant was not personally served with process,

might be under some circumstance an important consideration.

§ 7 Cold. 291-3.

And to give the court jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad Iilem, service upon the
infant personally is indispensable. Without such service, the appointment of a
guardian adlitemisa more nullity ; and no act of a guardian adlilem, so appointed,

can bring the infant before the court.

Section 48, ante, relating to the computation of time, has no reference to the
subject matter of this section. Dickinson v. Lcc, 2 Cold. 615, 618. In comput
ing the ﬁve days of this section, the day of service is included.

Thus, service on

Wednesday, will bind the defendant to appear at a court which meets the fol
lowing Monday. lb. And see Farmer's and Merchant's Bank, v. Johnson, 3
Humph. 26, which arose under the old Act, from which this section was compil

ed. The summons may be served on the defendant, even upon the return day,
so as to bind him to appear at the next term; for process retains its vitality dur
ing the whole of the return day, and is not funclus qﬂicio until the end of that
day. This is the general principlc determined in Valentine v. Cooley, 1 llumph.

§ 88, and approved in Browning v. Jones, 4 Humph. 69.

It is not necessary for the

sheriff to state in the return that tho writ was served ﬁve days before the return

issued ﬁne days before the return day, that is sufficient. It will be presumed
that the oﬂicer did his duty.

And a plea in abatement founded on such n. supposed defect in a sheriffs return should be set aside as frivolous.

But in Byrd v. Buckingham, 10 Humph. 434, it is suid that if the process were
not in fact served in due time, the defendant ( who hud appeared in court) should
have pleaded the matter in abatement. But if the want of jurisdiction of the
person of the defendant appear in the return, or otherwise on the face of the
proceedings, it is not necessary to plead iri abatement: u motion to dismiss will be
effectual. Parker v. Porter, 4 Yerg. 81. See Q 2902, sub-sec, 4. The return

§ 2837. The party applying for a change of venue shall make Mm o“pp,,_
a statement of facts, in writing, under oath or aﬁirmation, that °“‘°"'

he verily believes that owing to prejudice, or other causes, then
existing, he cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the county
where the cause is pending; the truth of which statement shall
be veriﬁed and supported by the oath of at least three respect
able and disinterested persons. [Act 1825, ch. 78,§ 1.]

§ 2838. If the presiding Judge, on due consideration, should gaggle order
be of opinion that the cause set forth is good and the truth
thereof evident and credibly supported, he shall allow the
change asked for.
This section makes it discretionary with the Circuit Judge to order the change
of venue or not; and the Supreme Court will not rcvise that discretion. Gass
way v. Smith, 8 Hnmph. 154, 167. Note.—In this case the venue had been

changed at the instance of the defendant, and the plaintiff some time afterwards
made application in conformity to the statute, to have the vcnuc again changed;

which application the Circuit Judge refused, and the ground of his refusal was
not stated in the bill of exceptions. Blackburn v. Hawthorn, 4 Cold. 214, con
curs with the above case so far as to hold that the Supreme Court cannot safely

revise the action of the Circuit Court, where the grounds of its action do not ap
pear in the record. Otherwise if the grounds of its action do appmr. But the
force of the reasoning of the court in this case is greatly weakened by the dis

senting opinion of Judge Hawkins. This case also holds—Hawkins J., strongly
dissenting—that the hearing of counter aiﬁdavits on the application to change
venue is error and ground of reversal.
§ 9839. The change of venue shall be made to the nearest
adjoining county free from the like exception, whether in the
same judicial circuit or out of it.
The fair interpretation of this section is, that the venue should only be changed
to a county out of the circuit, where such county is the nearest, free from like ex
ceptions. If the nearest county should be in the circuit but should not be free
from like exceptions, then the venue might be changed to a county out of the cir
cuit not subject to like exceptions. If none of the adjoining counties are shown
to be subject to like exceptions, then it is the imperative duty of the Judge to send
the cause to the nearest county. Coover v. Davenport. 1 Heisk. 868, 382. The
nearest county within the meaning of the statute; is the one whose county seat
is nearest; and what county this is, is a matter of which the (ﬁrcuit Judge should

take judicial notice. Ib. 883.

§ 9841. The party applying for a change of venue shall, in


the foregoing cases, pay the cost of the transcript, and trans
missionpf papers.

§ 9849. In all cases in equity, if the Judge is a party, or

directly interested in the suit, or is connected by blood or

aﬁinity within the prohibited degrees with any person so in-‘
terested, or is incompetentashavingbeen of counsel, the venue,

may be changed to the nearest Chancery Court as the case
may be, not liable to the like exception, as of course, at the in

stance of either party, without costs, unless at the term at which
the application is made (being a trial term) the cause shall be
heard and disposed of by a Judge not liable to the like excep
tion, by exchange.
And see Q1 3924, 3924 b. In jury cases in equity, see 2835.
§ 2843. When a change of venue is directed, the clerk of the
court shall make a transcript of all the minutes, orders, and
proceedings in the cause, duly certiﬁed, and envelope the same,
together with all the original papers, in a strong wrapper, se-.
curely sealed, and safely deliver, or transmit the same by mesa
senger, to the clerk of the court to which the venue has been
changed. [Ala. Code of 1851, § 2363.]
Before this statute, it was held in Walker v. Snowden, 1 Swan, 193, that if the
order for the change directed the clerk simply to send the transcript and not the
original papers, the whole order was void, and did not result in changing the
venue, or in ousting the original court of its jurisdiction, and the court to which
the venue was attempted to be changed, not acquiring any jurisdiction, could not

order the clerk of the court in which the cause originated to forward the original
papers, nor could it render judgment for costs.—But if the order changing venue

is valid, this ousts the original court of all further jurisdiction; and if on inspectmg the order, changing the venue, it appear to the court to which the venue
is changed, that the clerk of the original court has failed to comply with the order
in transmitting the record or papers, it may enforce its jurisdiction by order or '

wrtiorari, requiring the clerk who is keeper of the records to transmit them, or
supply any defect or omission that may appear in them. 1 Swan, 194. And this
may also be done in criminal cases. See Calhoun v. State, 4 Humph. 477, 479.

§ 2844. The clerk or messenger delivering the package will gpggggsalgu
be entitled to ﬁve cents a mile, going and returning, and tolls

Passed nu; o, mo. The General Assembly which passed the above Act
adjourned by joint resolution No. 30, to the ﬁrst Monday in December, 1870; and
did not adjourn sine die until February 6, 1871. Hence, according to the doc,
trine of Day v. McGinnis, 1 Heisk. 310, the above Act took effect March 19, 1871,

unless the new constitution, Art. 2, Q 12, repeals Q 162 of the Code.

See note §
§ 2845. Actions do not abate by the death, marriage, or other
disability of either party, or by the transfer of any interest
therein, if the cause of action survives or continues.

[Condensed from Act 1819, ch. 16, §§ 1, 3 ; 1786, ch. 14, §1 ;

§ 1836, ch. 77.]
The suggestimr of the death of a party, without an admission of record, or
proof, does not establish the fact of the death, or authorise the abatement of the
suit. Officer v. Young, 7 Yerg. 137.
Suits prosecuted by public qﬂicers in their oﬁicial capacity, and in their oﬂicial
name, do not abate by the death of the individual holding the oﬂiee, or the expira
tion of his term of service, and no revivor is necessary.
§ 2846. No civil actions commenced, whether founded on Wha‘I.nctlous
wrongs or contracts, except actions for wrongs aifectlng the
ll-l1'V VG

character of the plaintiff, shall abate by the death of eithe
party, but may be revived. [Act 1836, ch. 77.]
In case of motions against ofliccrs and their sureties, see Q 3597, and note.

Before this statute it was uniformly held that the acts in force authorized only the
revival of such suits us did not die with the person agreeably to the principle of
the common law; or such as had arisen az contrtwtu, and not eat ddicto, where the

maxim acli0pers0naZ1'Ai moritur cum persona applied.

Lewis v. Outlaw, 1 'I'enn_

§ 140, 142. And see Griﬂith v-. Beasley, 10 Yerg. 434, 487. But an administrator
could revive an action of trover commenced by his intestate in his lifetime, under

the statutes then existing.

For he had the right under 3 Edw. I11, ch. 7, to bring

trover himself for a conversion of his intestate's goods; and the right to sue car

ries with it the right to revive suit. Douglass v. Morford, 7 Yerg. 79, 81. But an action of detinue for chattels unlawfully taken and held, could not be sustained
against an executor or administrator as such, and could not, if pending against the

deceased be revived against him. Jones v. Littleﬁeld, 8 Yerg. 133. Nor could 1
deoastavit; being s personal tort of the administrator, it died with him. Griﬂith v.
Beasley, 10 Yerg. 484, 437. This case arose subsequent to the Act of 1836, ch.
§ 77, which was cited by counsel, and not noticed by the court. See Q 2224, and
note.
But since this statute, the common law maxim that s personal right of action

dies with the person, is no longer applicable in this State. Kimbrough v. Mitch
ell, ] Head, 589, 541. Hence, if the plaintiff who has recovered sjudgment in
an action for ppsault and battery dies pending an appeal in error to the Supreme

Court prosecuted by the defendant, it is not only the right but the duty of his per.
sonal representative to revive the appeal in error to the supreme court. For by
the recovery below the action for the personal injury becomes merged into a debt

by judgment, with which the administrator is chargeable. Ib. See note under Q
§ 2857. The original Act of 1836, ch. 77, read, “it shall be lawful to renew such
suit by or against the personal reprcmztative of such deceased, ” etc. Itwas hence
held to apply only to personal actions, and to have no application to real or mixed
actions; and therefore the action of forcible entry and detaincr, which, as modi

lied by our statutes is a mixed action, could not be revived by or against either
the personal or real representatives.

Nor could an appeal in the nature of a writ of

error from a judgment in forcible entry and detainer be revived. Havens v. Bick~
ford, 9 Humph. 678. But now see Q 8369, 2859, 8255. In a. suit under QQ 2290,
§ 2293, by husband and wife for wrongs and injuries done to the wife, if the wife
die pending the suit, it must be revived in the name of her personal representa
tive; and [unless the husband is such personal representative,] he is no longer s
necessary party. Bream v. Brown I5 Cold. 168, 174. Seenote underﬁ 2293. As

to the abatement of suits for divorce and alimony, see note under § 2477.
Intervention
of: term.

§ 2847. The intervention of a term between the death of a

party and the qualiﬁcation of the personal representative, shall
not work an abatement or discontinuance of the suit.

[Act 1789, ch. 51.]
This Act, prohibiting, negatively, the intervention of one term between the death

ofa party and the qualiﬁcation of his executor or administrator, from producing an
abatement of the suit, was construed to imply, afﬁrmatively, that the like interven
tion of two terms would work such abatement. Sappington v. Phillips, 1 Yerg. 105,

§ 107-8. And this rule has passed into an enactment in the following section.
Abate! at
second term.

§ 2848. Nor shall the suit abate or discontinue for the death
of either party, until the second term after the death has been
suggested and proved or admitted, and entry to that eﬁ'ect
made of record.
Scenote to preceding section.

The proper construction of the above sections

of the Code is, that the right to revive continues through the whole of the second
term after suggestion and proof or admission of death. Churchwell v. Bank of
EastTennessee, 1 Heisk. 780. Buta suit may be revived after the lapse of two

terms after tho death of a party, the suggestion of death having been made within
the time. Evans v. Jackson, lTeun. 287. Or if the personal representative ap
pear and ask to revive at any time before the suit is actually abated, the revivor
will be allowed. And it seems-—but this question the court rcsorve—that this is

the proper construction to the above provision of theCode.
Young v. 0ﬂicer,7 Yerg. 187, 140; Holland v. Harris, 2 Sneed, 68, 72.

§ 2849--285]
In this

last casca maker and endoser were jointly sued under the Act of 1837, ch. 5,

[see Q 2787, and note,] and pending the suit, the death of the maker was suggested
and proven, and thereupon it was entered of record that the plaintiﬂ‘ elected to
proceed against the endorser alone; and afterwards discovering that he could not

maintain this form of action against the endorser alone, he moved to revive the
suit against the personal representative of the maker. Held, that this might be
done although two terms had elapsed.

Theelection of record to proceed against

the maker did not amount to a dismission or abatement of the suit. 2 Sneed, 69, 78.
And so a suit in equity may be revived after the lapse of two terms by a bill of

revivor.

As to the rcvivor ofsuits in equity, see§

§ 4425, and note.

Entry of suggeation.—Where the clerk, instead of entering on the minutes be
fore the trial, the suggestion of the death of the co-plaintiff, and that there were
no executors or administrators, and that the court was satisﬁed of that fact, made

tho entry follow the entry of verdict and judgment against the other defendant,
this, though very informal, was in substantial compliance with the Act of 1825,
ch. 65, Q 1. Britton v. Thompson, 6 Yerg. 825, 830.

§ 2849. If no person will administer on the estate of a de-§§fy§;,=<}]e,"‘
ceased plaintiff or defendant, the suit may be revived by or ;',,*;,*;',;,;:;,g$,',=,;_
against the heirs of the decedent. [Act 1809, ch. 121, § 3.]
And by the original Act, ii‘ the heirs are minors, the court will appoint a guar
dinn, which being done, the suit may be proceeded in as in other cases. See
Bandy v. Walker, 3 Head, 568. The county court has no power to appoint a
special administrator to defend a particular suit. Ib. See Q 2204 a; Q 2209 at seq.
If the plaintiff dies, and no person being willing to administer, the suit is revived
in the name of his heir, no acire fociae is necessary; though if one is ordered,
this will not vitiate the order of revivor.

[Act 1825, ch. 65, § 3.]
“ lVotpa1'tners."—Thc common law rule still holds us to partners, the survivor
alone maintaining the suit. Car. Lawsuit, 1 48. See also § 2011, and cases there
cited. Joint tenancy ; mr'0t'vo'rship.—Il. is said in Sappington v. Phillips, 1 Yerg.
§ 105, 109, that although the, right of survivorship is abolished [see Q 20l0,]—the
rtmedy still continues; and in case of the death of one joint tenant the survivor
sues alone, as at common law; citing common law authorities. This decision was
contemporaneous with the Act of 1825, as above, of which it takes no notice.
This ruling is said to be in accordance with the construction put upon similar

statutes in other States. Car. Lawsuit, § 43. But in this State construing the
same Act and that of 1789, ch. 57, Q 5, [Q 2789,] the contrary rule is stated in
Perkins v. Hadley, 4 Hayw. 148, 152, as follows: “The remedy is still single, but
with the addition of another plaintiﬂi If the survivors sue without the executors of the deceased, then, as the latter ought tobe parties in order to secgre the share

of the judgment which by the law of 1784 they are entitled to, the others ought
to be stopped by plea in aba temm! from proceeding in the action brought by them

alone.

How else can the executors ever get their share under the Act of 1784 ?"

And this is the practice under the Act of 1825 ; for if the sole right to sue were

in the survivor there could be no propriety in abatiug suit. Car. Lawsuit, § 43.
See Q 2789, nnd note ; Q 2988, and note; Gregory v. Chadwell, 3 Cold. 390.

Or defendant

§ 2852. But, if the suit is not thus revived within the two

§i°-Zdfeil- terms allowed, the defendant
may revive
or elect to proceed to trial with the surviving plaintiﬂ, or abate the suit, if revivor
is necessary.

[Ib.]

Before this statute, it was held that the Acts of 1784, ch. 22, Q 6, [§ 2010,] and
§ 1789, ch. 57, Q 6, [Q 2789,] did not have the etfect of giving two actions instead of
one. That is, the survivors could not bring one action for their share, and the
representative of the deceased co-tenant another action for his. All must be join
ed in the action; and if some will not agree to prosecute the suit, such must be
summoned and servai, and the others proccctl alone. Perkins v. Hadley, 4 Hayw.
§ 148, 152-8. The death of a joint plaintitf in error in the Supreme Court is cmbrac

ed in the above provision.

Patterson v. Buttcrworth, 4 Yerg. 158.

And if some

of the parties against whom a judgment has been rendered refuse to join in the

prosecution of the writ of error, they must be summoned and served before the
others can proceed alone. Huif v. Miller, 1 Swan, 85.

§ 2853. When any sole executor or administrator is plaintiff

§§§’i‘i.'i§r‘=iii"e'§‘ or defendant, and dies, the suit may be revived by or against
Mm“
the executor, administrator de bonis non, or other successor in
interest of the decedent.
For, upon the death of an administrator or executor under our law, no interest
in the property left unadministercd is transmissible to his personal representa
tive. Swtt v Alexander, 2 Snecd, 650, 652-3. And the remedy of the creditor in
such a case is not against tho administrator of the administrator, but against the

administrator de bonis non.

Jones v. Jones, 8 Humph. 705, 707. And soe note to

Q 2229 ; note to Q 2240. The administration of an estate is an entire thing; and
where there are several administrators, if one of them dies or resigns, the entire

authority remains with the survivors, and the appointment of an administrator dc
bnnis non, is void. Lewis v. Brooks, 6 Yerg. 167, 180.

Note to §§ 2854 - 2857.--No cases can be revived in the Supreme Court except
such as are subject to be revived in the court below. Havens v. Bickford, 9
Humph. 673, 675. Thus, before the Act of 1850, ch. 112, [infra, § 3369,] an ap
peal in error from a judgment in forcible entry and detainer could not be revived
in the Supreme Court. Ib. An appeal in the nature of a. writ of error merely
suspends the judgment of the court below, but does not annul it; and consequent
ly if an appeal in error be abated or dismissed the judgment below is left unim
paired and in full force. Kimbrough v. Mitchell, 1 Head, 539; Furber g. Carter,
§ 2Bneed, 1; Thomason v. Kercheval, 10 Humph. 322; Churchwell v. Bank of
East Tennessee, 1 Heisk. 780.
“ Under the foregoing rules,” I 285-t.—Unless the representative of the plain

tiﬁ' in error comes forward and causes himself to be made a party, the suit, after
the expiration of two terms, abates.

Sappington v. Hickman, 1 Yerg. 105, 107-8.

The right to revive continues through the whole of the second term after the sug.
gestion and proof or admission of death; and if the motion to revive is made
within this time, a motion to abate previously made will not affect or defeat the

right to revive. Churchwell v. Bank of East Tennessee, 1 Heisk. 780. And it
seems—but this question is reserved—that a revivor should be allowed at any time
alter the expiration of two terms, if motion is made before abatement entered. Ib.
In case of abatement, by the British practice, a remittitur issues to the court below;
that is, the record is remitted to the inferior court, with a certiﬁcate of the abate
ment. But by our practice, where n. copy of the record only is sent to the ap

pellate ccurt, a copy of the order declaring the suit abated is sent to the court be
. low.

Ib., 106, 108.

In case a judgment or decree is rendered against two par

ties jointly, and afterwards, but before ﬁling the record for error, one of them
dies, his administrator may prosecute a writ of error jointly with the survivor.
But he cannot do this by simply joining the survivors in the ﬁling of the record
and the execution of the bond. In such a case it is indispensable that the death
of the judgment defendant should be ﬁrst suggested and proved; and that there

upon, a scire _facia.r should be awarded, uniting the two-fold oﬂice of a wire facias
to revive the decree against the administrator, and a scire facias ad andicndum
errorcs. Hui!‘ v. Miller, 2 Swan, 85. Or, it seems that the survivor may bring a

writ of error alone.

§ 2858. Where a suit is commenced in the name of one per

suit may be prosecuted, without revivor, as if the death had
not happened. -[Act 1825, ch: 29,§ 3.]
See Q1 2795, 3200, 38l0.—It was stated in Morrison v. Deaderick, 10 Humph.
§ 342, 344, as one of the objects of the Act of 1825, to prevent the death of the
nominal -plaintiff from working an abatement, or requiring the suit to be revived

in the name of his personal representative. Nevertheless, if the nominal plain
tiﬂ be dead at the commencement of the suit, that fact may be pleaded in abate

§ 2859. Suits abated by the death of either party may be re

the decedent’s place in the subject-matter of litigation.

See § 2846, and note; Q 3255.--Attachment suits, having for their object to
enforce the appearance of the debtor, must be revived against his personal repre
sentative, before the property attached can be condemned to be sold. And if the
property attached be land, it must be revived against the heirs also. Green v.
Shaver, 3 Humph. 139, 141 ; dted and approved in Perkins v. Norvell, 6 Humph.

The proper course is to revive against the personal representative; and if

the plea. of “no assets” or “fully administered" is found in his favor, to take

judgment against him quando zwciderint; and thereupon, issue a scirefaciss against
the heirs, citing them to show cause why the judgment should not be satisﬁed out
of the lands to them descended, upon which the attachment has been levied. Upon
the return of the scire faciaa, the heirs have the right to show, if they can, that
there are assets unadministered in the hands of the personal representative, out of

which the judgment may be satisﬁed. Ib. And see at length Administration,
{Q 2252, 2273, and notes. A suit may be revived against an executor do son tort,

In such case, the person against

Cobb v. Lanier, 4 Hayw. 297-8. See citations underﬁ 2201. If the defendant

common law the marriage might be pleaded in abatement at the next term after
the marriage, but at no subsequent term. 1 Chit. Pl. 449, note 4; Car. Lawsuit,

And such was the provision of the original Act of 1819.

§ 2861. -The husband of a female plaintiff may make l1im- Buthulbali
self a party plaintiff by motion, and by giving bond with good miviliiiiv-M by

security to prosecute the suit with effect, or to pay the costs of

On the execution of such bond, the

original security for the prosecution is discharged from liability
for subsequently accruing costs. [Ib., § 2.]
“ Is it to depend apon the choice of the husband whether he becomes a party
or not? The spirit of our law is that he may be come a party ; but if he does not,
she may proceed alone." Car. Lawsuit, E 291. [But, query ?—Eds.] See Q 2487,

General principles.—By the common law trivial errors as to mispleading in
civil cases were amendable while the proceedings weieinﬁeri and not after
wards. Hite v. State, 9 Yerg, 198, 208; citing 8 Bla. Com. 406; 6 Dane’s Dig.

§ 406.

And see Meigs’ Dig. Q 95.

It is a downright violation of principle and of

good sense to determine any cause otherwise than upon its merits; and it 15 a

great imputation on the judges that so many statutes of jeofaila have been needed
to remove adherence to forms, and to place common sense upon her native seat,
from which she had been driven by technicalities. Henderson v. King, 4 Hayw.
§ 94, 97. The language of our act of amendments is very broad, and the prac
tice under it has been to indulge liberally in amendments in order that jus

tice may be attained, and that causes may be tried on the merits without being
entangled in the nice formalities of the law. Green, J., in Hunter v. Sevier,
§ 7Yerg. 186. Amendments should only be allowed on such terms as to pre
vent injustice. Luyster v. Snifiin, 3 How. 250. The only proper inquiry for
the court is, whether the proposed amendment will change substantially the
cause of action or defence; or, if not, whether it will be in furtherance ol‘jus
tice to allow it. Harris, J., in Dutcher v. Slack, 8 Ab. Pr. R. 322; 1 Code. Rep.
§ 113. The rule which forbids an amendment introducing a new cause of action
is recognized in Nance v. Thompson, 1 Sneed, 821, 827. But otherwise as to new
parties. Q 2869; Q 2798, and note. Whenever the court can see that justice
would be furthered by an amendment of the pleadings and proceedings in an ac
tion, ifasked for, it should grant the amendment on terms just to the opposite
party. Courts will permit amﬁidments at any stage of the cause to come atjus
tice, taking care that the opposite party is not put in a worse condition. Beard
v. Young. 2 Tenn. 64. At any time to reach the merits and attain justice.
Gillespie v. Davis, 5 Yerg. 319. It has been the constant course of the courts to
allow amendments to reach the justice of the case; our Acts of Assembly require
that it should be permitted; and when a trial has been had upon the merits, the
court here will not determine t-ho cause, perhaps against the justice of it, upon
technicality. Blakemore'v. Negro Phill., 7 Yerg. 452, 465. It is in all cases
proper, however, in order to prevent laxity and negligence in pleading, to require
from the party asking the amendment some reasonable excuse for the defect in

pleading, which he seeks to correct.

Harrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 164.

Amendments must be I1-ue.—A plea ought not be amended, even in matter of
form, unless it be made to appear that it is probably true. Overton v. Crabb, 4
Hnyvv. 109. And in Henderson v. King, 4 Hayw. 94, 98, it was said that :t plea
of former judgment might be amended by stating that the judgment was upon
the merits, but that it ought to be sworn to. And the court could not, under the _
Act of 1809, ch. 49, § 21, or the Act of-1 Ai_me, ch. 16, allow an alias capias to be
ﬁled, and a return of mm est invenlua made thereon, to supply a chasm, where the
process had not been properly continued and kept up, so as tolay the loundation
for ajudicial attachment; for the court in making amendments cannot insert an
untruth, and say that a return was made by the sheriff which was never made by
him, and by such means lay the foundation for convening before them a defendant
who could not have been proceeded against but for such false insertion. Slatton
v. Jonson, 4 Hnyw. 197. And see Beard v. Young, 2 Tenn. 54.
Must be good in substance.—-Thus, an amendment setting forth a parol agree
ment varying the terms of theinstrument sued on, is not permissible. Blakemore
v. Wood, 8 Sneed, 470, 4-74. An amendment should not be allowed, if bad in sub
stance, and which, if allowed, would not support the action. Ib.
Aml szgﬁc‘icni.—lt is not error to refuse to allow a defendant to ﬁle an amend
ed plea bad in substance, and which if true would be no defence to the action.
Grissom v. Fite, 1 Head, 332. After a judgment has been set aside a defectire plea ought not to be allowed.

Tiernan v. Napier, 5 Yerg. 410, 413.

Thus

where there has been a recovery upon a record ofjudgment from another State.
the judgment will not be set aside to allow the defendants to plead negatively
the statute of limitations of the foreign State, unless they aver that the plain
tiﬂ‘s were not within any of its savings.

Gillespie v. Davis, 5 Yerg. 319.

the substance of this case is that a cause will not be re-opened after judgment
to permit amendments which do not reach the merits] Nor is it error before
judgment to refuse to allow an endorser to ﬁle a plea of non cdfactum alleging
that the notes sued on were in blank as to amount, when endorsed by him; and
that the person for whose accommodation they were endowed, ﬁlled them up with
a greater amount than he was authorized; because such plea did not aver that the
endorsee had notice of such wantof authority. 1 Head. 335. And a plea alleg
ing tender of speciﬁcarticlesat atime and place appointed, which does not avai
that the defendant wns nt the place ready to deliver during tho whole day, or to the
last moment, or “uttermost convenient time of the day,” and which does not also

st-ate facts showing a sutﬁcient notice of the time and place, ought not to be re
ceived after assessment of damages on writ of inquiry. 5 Yerg. 414-15. The
plea should be presented to the court when the leaveto ﬁle it as an amendment

is asked for, so that the court can determine its suﬁiciency.

Dockery v. Miller, 9

Humph. 731, 734%; Raney v. Saunders, 4 Humph. 447.

And if it presents a

good defence to the action, the court should allow it to be ﬁled. 4 Humph. 448.
But in Beard v. Young, it is held that the court will not [at the appearance term]
determine, on hearing the motion to amend, the suliciency of the plea offered by
way of amendment; but will leave the other party to demur or take issue, unless

the plea is evidently frivolous.
it out on its own motion.

In which case the court may strike

Q 2882.

Amendment ofpl¢as.—-In modern times a defendant is allowed to plead the
statute of limitations by way of amendment, although the old doctrine was to the
contrary. Coleson v. Blanton, 3 Hayw. 152, 159. But see Gillespie v. Davis, 5

Yerg. 319, where it was sought to plead the Virginia statute of limitations after
judgment, and without averring that the plaintiﬁs were not within its exceptions.
And the plea of tender is no longer discountenauoed, and will be allowed as an
amendment when it reaches the merits. Tiernan v. Napier, 5 Yerg. 410, 413.
Pleas in abatement are omendable in matter of form, as before the Codckas in
case of u defective veriﬁcation. Trahue v. Higden, 4 Cold. 620, 624.
further as to the amendment of pleas, QQ 2901, 2892, 2935, andnotes.

Process, when amendable.—The term of court of which a writ is tested, and to
which it is returned, may be changed by amendment.
McBee v. Petty, 3 Cold.

And where an original attachment was made returnable the ﬁrst Monday

after the second Monday of May, wheii the day ﬁxed by law for holding the court
wm the ﬁrst Monday after the fourth Monday in May; and the record showed that
publication had been “duly made,” and judgment ﬁnal having been taken by de
fault, this was not an error affecting the merits, for which alone undcr Q 4515,
the Supreme Court can reverse. Beeler v. Huddleston, 8 Cold. 201. For the de
fendant is bound to take notice of the times of holding the court. 8 Cold. 180.
And in an ancillary attachment, issued by a justice, and returnable to the Circuit

Court, [see QQ 3462, 3468,] where the plaintiff had omitted to sign the allidavit, this
was amendable in the Circuit Court. Scott v. White,l Thompson’s cases, 34.
But where after a return of not found, a term had elapsed without the issuance of

mesne process, the court. would not allow an alias to prevent a discontinuance.
Slatton v. Johnson, 4 Hayw. 197, 199. Nor could a return of non est imrcntus
be made on such a process, if permitted to be ﬁled. Such an amendment would be
false, and for that reason cannot he made. Ib.
Return amendable, when.-See on this point the case in 4 Hayw. abovc cited.
In a case where the slreritfis not a party he may amend his return at any time, so
as to state the truth of the case. Atkinson v. Rhea, 7 Humph. 59, 61. This in
case of an execution may be done after mperaedeas, and motion to quash. Ib. But a

sheriﬁ' cannot be permitted to amend his return so as to avoid a motion pending
against him for an insuﬂicient return. Mullins v. Johnson, 3 Humph. 396. But
a return may be made after notice of the motion, and before the motion is actual
ly made. The principle is, that it is the lie pendma that preclpdes the right to
amend ; and the commencement of the suit is the motion, and not the notice that
a motion is to be made. Broughton v. Allen, 6 Humph. 96; Howard v. Union
Bank, 6 Humph. 26 ; Hill v. Hinton, 2 Head, 124; King v. Breeden, 2 Cold. 466.
§ 459. The reason is, that it would be too strong a temptation to the oﬂicer to so

amend his return as to shield himself from the impending action, though it might
be at the expense of truth.

Howard v. Union Bank, 6 Humph. 26.

But this rul

ing goes to the extreme verge of the law, [in favor of the oﬂicer] and will not be
further extended. 2 Cold. 463.

The motion to amend will not be entertained, al

though made immediately after the motion for the oﬂiciul delinquency. lb.

And

it seems that an amendment to the notice of the motion against the oﬂicer will

not be the commencement of a new suit, so as to extend the time within which the
motion to amend the return may be made. Ib. Certainly the motion to amend the
return will not be entertained, if made immediately after the motion to amend
the notice of the motion for the oﬂicial default. Ib. [The returns sought to be
amended in the above cases, were returns upon executions, except that in 2. Head,
which was a return upon an alias summons; but the principle stated was the
same in all.] If a sheriﬁ"s return is void for insufficiency and uncertainty, an

amendment thereto will not be permitted which seeksto give a new or different
description of the. property levied upon.

Porter v. Fine, 1 Thompson’s cases, 86.

Upon the same principle the deputy who made the original return, wil not be per
mitted to amend, and thereby protect his principal ; and as a necessary consequence,
shield himself from liability to his principal. Howard v. Union Bank, 7 Humph.
§ 26.

-Afidamit ammdable, when.—An atﬁdavit of lost bond sued on under Q 3901, is
ameudable. See that section and note. But if no affidavit has been made in an
attachment case, it cannot be supplied by way of amendment. “ This is too clear
for argument.” Mclieynolds v. Neal, 8 Hhmph. 12. But if a defective atﬁdavit
for an attachment has been made, this is amendable. Thus, where the plaintitl‘ in
an ancillary attachment sued out before a justice, omitted to sign the aﬂidavit, it
was held amendable in the Circuit Court. Scott v. White, 1 Thompson's Cases,
§ 38. And see Q 3477. And the aﬂidavit in replevin is amendable. Applewhite v.
Allen, 8 Humph. 697.
Bonds amendal1le.—Attachment bonds, Q 3477, and note.—Replevin bonds,§
§ 8392.

Amendment, how made.—The general rule in respect to statutes of amendment
and jcofails is, that the amendment need not, in point of fact, be made. The bene

ﬁt of the statute is obtained by the court's overlooking the exception and con
sidering the amendment as made. Eakiu v. Burger, 1 Sneed, 417, 425; McBee
v. Petty, 3 Cold. 178, 181 ; Beeler v. Huddlestcn, 8 Cold. 201, 203; citing 3 Bla.

Com. 407; 1 Saunders, 228, n. 1.

The Supreme Court cannot, where there is no

bill of exceptions, look to interlineations and erasures made by the clerk in a

transcript as evidence of how a writ read before amendment. 8 Cold. 179-80.
[It seems, though not directly stated, that in this case the amendment was made
by erasures and interlincations in the process, and that the clerk endeavored to
exhibit these amendments by copying these erasures and interlineations into the transcript. The statutes of amendment of some of the States prohibit amendments
being made in this way, but require them to be made by ﬁling another paper,
either in addition to the original, or as a substitute, preserving the original. See
Iowa Code of 1860, § 2983 ; N. Y. Code ; Ky. Code.—Eds.] In such a case,where
there is no bill of exceptions, and the contrary not appearing from the record, the

Supreme Court will regard the necessary amendment as having been made. 3 Cold.
§ 208.

And in support of the action of the court below, will presume it correctly

But see State v. Columbia it Hampshire T. P. Co., 2

Sneed, 254 ; cited under Q 2871.

Eject of amenrlmenis.—In the old form of ejectment, new demises in the name
of the plaintiff inserted by way of amendment, related to the commencement of
the suit, so as to avoid the bar of the statute oflimitations, while a new demise in

the name ofa new party was regarded as a new suit.

Nance v. Thompson, 1

Sneed, 321, 828. Amendment changing the form of the action, as from debt to
assumpsit, did not relate to the commencement of the suit, but took effect against
the statute of limitations from the date of the amendment. Crotford v. Cothran,
§ 2 Sneed, 492, 495. And see King v. Brecden, 2 Cold. 455. But in general and
for most purposes an amendment will relate to the commencement of the suit.
§ 2 Sneed, 495. And where a new party is made in an action ea: contrartu, it must

be regarded as the bringing of a new suit.

Bank of Tennessee v. Skil1ern,2

Sneed, 698, 700. And where the property ofa person is attached in a chancery
proceeding before making him a party, and afterwards an amended bill is ﬁled

making him a party, the lien of the attachment dates only from the ﬁling of the
amended bill.

Where the record showed the grant of an appeal simply, instead of an appeal

Where a husband and wife were jointly sued in replevin, and the declaration
alleged that the wife took and unjustly detained the property, instead of averring
against both wife and husband, this, under the Act of 1862, ch. 152, was matter of
form for which judgment could not be arrested. Corn v. Brazelton, 2 Swan, 273.
And in the old form of ejectment, when the terms of the ﬁctitious lease hnd ex
pired, it was held amendable as a matter of course. Huffv. Lake, 9 Humph. 137.
And where suit was commenced by a guardian on behalf of his ward, and after

Time and terms of an-.cm1ment.—At any stage of the cause to come at justice,
care being taken that the opposite party is not put in a worse situation. Beard v.
Young, 2 Tenn. 54. But amendments should be applied for before ﬁnaljudgment.
Suitors should notbe permitted to experiment on one form of pleading, and failing
in that, to resort to mother. Shugart v. Orr. 5 Yerg. 192. This old case held,
that after a writ of error from the County Court to the Circuit Court, [under the
old practice,] an amendment was not allowable. Ib. _And aftcrverdict and judg
ment, an application to put in a new defence comes too late, where no merits are
disclosed. Gillespie v. Davis, 6 Yerg. 819. But it is no error to allow a material
amendment after verdict; but in such case the defendant must, if he desire it, be
allowed to plead de novo, and have a new trial. Floyd v. Woods, 4 Yerg. 165.
And after a new trial granted in a cause appealed from ajustice, it is competent
for the court after ‘verdict and judgment, to amend the warrant by inserting the
christian names of the plaintiffs, and without inquiring into the propriety ofa pend
ing motion to quash the proceedings. Irwin v. Sanders, 5 Yerg. 287. And it is
erroneous to quash the proceedings after such an amendment made. Ib. And
the surname of defendant, casually omitted, may be inserted in a justice’s warrant
in the Circuit Court on terms in the discretion of the Judge, as to costs, and so as
to prevent surprise or prejudice. Jones v. Miller, 1 Swan, 319. And after judg
ment by default, but before inquiry of damages, the plaintiff may well be allowed
to amend his pleadings by increasing his damages, and this need not be upon
terms of allowing the defendant to plead ; but had the defendant produced a plea
with the proper aﬁidavit, he should have been allowed to plead. Fowlkes v. Web
ber, B Humph. 530, I582. And itis right to allow the plaintilf at the trial to strike
from the writ and declaration the name of a party who had no interest in the suit.
Such amendments have often been made. Wilson v. King, 6 Yerg. 493. And
after a cause has been remanded from the Supreme Court, and after inquiry of
damages in the Circuit Court, thejudgment by default and judgment ﬁnal may be set
aside, and a plea of tender received, or the pleadings otherwise amended, if the
justice ofthe case seems to require it. Tiernan v. Napier, 5 Yc-rg. 410, 418. But
the amendment of a plea which materially enlarges the line of defence, should not
be permitted, at trial, and after argument nearly concluded except upon terms of a
mistrial and continuance. To permit such an amendment under such circumstances
is error and ground of reversal. Fowlkes v. Long, 4 Hnmph. 511. Nor will an
amendment changing the form ofaction be permitted after the Judge has commenced

new parties, made at the trial and alter the jury were empannelled, which does not
appear to have prejudiced the defendant, is not ground of reversal. Brazleton r.
Tumey, 7 Cold. 267. As to amendments adding new parties, sec § 2798, and note.

§ 286§. N0 civil suit shall be dismissed for want of necessary
parties, or on account of the form of action, or for want of
proper averments in the pleadings; but the courts shall have
power to change the form of action, strike out or insert in the
writ and pleadings the names of either plaintiﬁs or defendants,
so as to have the proper parties before the court, and to allow
all proper averments to be supplied, upon such terms as to con
tinuances asthe court in its sound discretion may see proper

to impose.
Form of action.-Before this statute the fonn of action could not be changed
by amendment, but new counts in the same form ofaction might be put in.

Wilson v. Smith, 5 Yerg. 379, 395; Johnson v. Pluuter's Bank, 1 Humph. 77, 79.
But ifthe writ was in one form of action, and the declaration in another, it was
cured by plea to the merits, verdict and ju-lgrnent. 1 Humph. 79. For the stat
ute 5 Geo. I, was in force in this State by virtue of the Act of 1794, ch. 1,§ 27,
and under it no judgment can be reversed after verdict, for any variance in the
writ from the declaration, either in form or substance. Ib., 80.

Forms of action. were ﬁrst in Tennessee abolished by the Code.

See Q 2746,

at seq. The Code [of Kentucky, in abolishing forms of action,] does not change
the law which determines what facts, shall constitute a cause of action; though

by reducing all forms of action to one, it changes the question, whether the facts
show a cause of action in trespass, trover, assnmpsit, or any other particular form,
into the question whether the petition shows a right of action in any form—by

showing a right in the plaintiff, and an injury to that right by the defendant, which

i is to be determined by the general rules of law respecting rights and wrongs,
as established b_v long usage in particular actions. Hill v. Barrett, 14 B. Mon. 85.
It seems that the power to amend does not extend to changing substantially the
cause of action. Harris, J., in Dutcher v. Slack, 3 Ab. Prac. R. 332; S. C. 1,
Code Rep. 113; Dows v. Green, 3 Pr. R. 378. But these decisions were under
the New York statute of amendment, which contained the following clause: “when

the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defence."

Our Code

contains no such provision; but in Nance v. Thompson, 1 Sneed, 321, 327, the
court recognize the principle that amendments will not be permitted which intro
duce a new rig/lit of action, or new parties. But the question here arose before
the enactment of the above statute, which changes the rule as to parties. See

ante, Q 2798, ct seq. Where a person commenced his action upon a contract with
a view to obtain an advantage which he could not obtain if he sued in tort, and
having obtained that advantage, it was held that he could not amend by changing
his action to tort. Lane v. Bean, 1 Abbott, 65. And see Beasley v. Bradley, B
Swan, 180, where it was held that although forms of action before Justices of the
Peace would be disregarded, yet a party could not sue for a tort, and failing in
that recover on the contract out of a breach of which the tort was alleged to have

sprung.

And in Jennings v. Mercer, 1 Heisk. 5, 9, it is held that the above sec

tion docs not extend to permitting the form of action to be changed—as ina case
brought from a Justice’s court, from “ debt on account ” to “trespass ”—after the

court had commenced~ charging the jury. The reasonable construction of our
statutes of amendment is, that a change of the form of action will only be allowed
before trial. Ib.

But a party may join in the same action counts in contract and

in tort. Q 2748.
J]fs_join<lcr.-—The Act of 1851-2, is a very strong and universal statute of jeo

fails.

So much so, that the above section cures a misjoinder of counts in the same action against a. maker or cndorser, and a guarantor.
Sneed 417, 424-5.

§ 2870-987!
Eakin v. Burger, 1

It has been held error to refuse amendments in the following (and perhaps other)
cases : Where it was sought to strike out the name of the nominal plaintiﬂ‘. Smyth
v. Carden, 1 Swan, 28. Where it was sought to strike out the words “adminis
trator of the estate of Thomas Payne,” in awariunt in forcible entry and detainer,
such words being diacriptio personac. Winningham v. Crouch, 2 Swan, 170.
Where it was sought to insert the surname of a defendant in a warrant. Jones
‘V. Miller, 1 Swan, 319. W'hcre it was sought to amend by showing to what
court an appeal from a justice’s judgment had been granted. Rogers v. Cochran,
§ 3 Yerg. 311. Where it was sought to allow a justice to amend the papers in a
cause appealed from his court to the Circuit Court, so as'to show that an appeal
was prayed and granted, the appeal bond showing that fact. Lawler v. Howard,

Meigs, 15. Where. the bond in a proceeding by certiorari and supersedeas to
quash an execution was defective, and it was sought to ﬁle a new bond. Jen
nings v. Pray. 8 Yerg. S5.
But it was not error to refuse a formal amendment to a plea in abatement.
Helm v. Rodgers, 5 Humph. 105, 107. Being a matter of discretion which the
Supreme Court will not readily control. Ib. And see Fowlkes v. Long, 4 Humph.
§ 511, 514 ; Dockery v. Miller, 9 Humph. 731, 734 ; Steel v. West, 7 Humph. 109.

And it is in the discretion of the Circuit Court to refuse the application where
leave is asked generally to amend, without presenting the proposed amendment.
Rainey v. Sanders, 4 Humph. 447; approved in Dockery v. Miller, 9 Humph. 731,
§ 734. On the other haiid, if the plea is drawn out in proper form, containing a
good defense to the action, veriﬁed by aﬁidavit, and presented before argument
of demurrer, it is error not to receive it. 9 Humph. 734. But it is not error to
refuse to receive a defective plea. Grissom v. Fite, 1 Head, 832. Nor an amend
ment which would make a plea bad for duplicity. 9 Humph. 743. And where a
justice‘s warrant was fatally defective on account of a joinder of several defend
ants who should have been sued separately, it was not error to refuse an amend
ment in another particular which was authorized by the statute of amendments;

for on account of the misjoinder of parties the warrant, was fatally defective, and
was properly quashed.

Wilson v. Rogers, 8 Humph. 213.

§ 2870. These amendments, if applied for at the appearance Costs of
term, may be made without costs; if at any subsequent term, amendments.
upon such conditions as the court may prescribe so as to pre
vent delay. [Ib.]

§ 2871. These provisions shall apply to penal as well as Penal actions
civil actions.

[Ib.]

As to the amendment of indictments, see Q 5141, and note.
At common law, it seems that qui tam and criminal actions were amendable, but

only in matters of form.

Hite v. State, 9 Yerg. 198, .203.

But the English

statutes of amendment [adopted by us by Acts of 1797, ch. 9, Q 35, and 1794,
ch. 1. Q 27,] did not apply to penal actions. Banﬁeld v. Milnor, 2 Burr. 1098. But
in Wilson v. Rogers, 8 Yerg. 413, 414, it was said that the Act of 1809, ch. 49, §
§ 21, would authorize an amendment in such an action.
Under this statute, an amendment of a justice's warrant, stating the amount
of the penalty, which had been left blank, was proper ; for by this statute amend
ments in civil and penal actions are placed on the same footing. Childress v.
Mayor 8: Aldermen of Nashville, 8 Sneed, 347, 358. But in a proceeding by
wire facias against a corporation for an alleged misfeasance which would operate

as a forfeiture of its charter, an amendment being asked for and allowed but never
made, the proceedings were subsequently quashed; and the Supreme Court held
that this was no error, and that under the statute ofjeofails the amendment
could not be made in that court.

§ 2 Sneed, 254.
Amendment
afterjudgment.

State v. Columbia & Hampshire Turnpike Co.,

But see note to Q 2863.

§ 2872. After judgment, any defects or imperfections in
matters of form may be rectiﬁed and amended by the court in
which the judgment is rendered, or the court to which it_
shall be removed, if snbstaritial ustice requires it, and if the
amendment is in ailirmance of thejudgment. [Ib., §4, proviso.]
See H 2875, 4516, and note.

The Supreme Court will not reverse for small errors in computing the amount
of judgment; as an excess of $1.08.

Such errors escape under the maxim do

minimus non curat ler, and are cured by the above statute.

Edwards v. Greene,

§ 5 Sneed, 669. And so where the amount slatted in the judgment exceeds by $1.35
that laid in the writ. Williams v. Bank of Tenn. 1 Cold. 48, 47. Otherwise where
errors amount to a considerable sum, as $121.38. Lay ‘v. State, 5 Sneed, 604,
§ 607. Where the record showed service of process, ﬁling of declaration, jury
sworn to try the Lssiars joined, both parties being present, and no plea was found
in the record, the absence of a plea was held matter of form for which the Su
preme Court would not, since the abovo statute roverse. Cornelius v. Merritt, 2
I-lend, 97. But the general rule is-not changed by the Act of 1852, nor by the
Code—-that the verdict of a jury where there are no issues to try, [except upon
inquiry of damages, and in like case;-1,] is a mere nullity. Hayﬁeld v. Hunter, 2
Sneed, 443, 446; Trabue v. Higden, 4 Cold. 620, 625. And the want of a repli
cation is not cured by verdict, although the want of similiter is. 4 Cold. 625.

And where the judgment, damages in the Circuit Court, and damages iu the Su
preme Court, exceeded the amount laid in the writ, it was held, that the writ and
declaration could be amended in the Supreme Court, in support and ailirinnnce of

the proceedings below.

Martin v. Bunk of Tenn. 2 Cold. 332, 335.

The mingling

of a portion of the damages with the amount of the debtas stated in the judg
ment, is an error which now “ amounts to nothing.” 1 Cold, 47.

§ 77w Supreme Court will remand to amend, when it is manifest from the proof
that the plaintiﬁ‘ has a good cause of action, though defectively set forth in the
declaration. McCandlass v. Polk, 10 Humph. 617, 620; Stovall v. Bowers, Ib.,
§ 560. Thus, where an assignee sued upon a written instrument, and his declara
- tion did not aver an assignment to him, it was held proper to remand to amend, in
stead of permitting the amendmeutin the Supreme Court. 10 Humph. 560;lb., 617,
§ 621. The principle stated in Wilson v. Smith, 5 Yerg. 879, 397, was that if the
plaintiifis entitled to recover in some form upon the evidence he has offered, or upon
counts properly adapted to his case, the cause should be remanded to the Cir
cuit Court to be proceeded in dz nova, and to the end that such amendment be
made as will bring forward the merits. In other words, if he is entitled to recover
on the cause of action as proved and as stated in the pleadings, the Supreme Court
will affirm the judgment, or render such judgment as should have been given be

low ; but if ho is entitled to recover on his cause of action as proved, but not on
his cause of action as stated, the court will remand with directions to amend. 10
Humph. 621. In Smyth v. Carden, 1 Swan, 28, where the holder of a note pay
able to bearer, sued in the name of the original payee for his use, it was held :1.
proper case for amendment by stricking out the name of the nominal plaintilf,

(who had ceased to be a. party to the instrument, and in whose name the action
could not be supported ;) but as this amendment, if made in the Supreme Court, might properly preclude some just defence, the cause would be remanded for this
purpose. But it would seem from Overlon v. Crabb, 4 Hayw. 109, that where a
_plea of performance to a declaration in covenant concludes with a veriﬁcation i_n

stead of to the county, the defendant would be allowed to amend in the court of
errors upon showing that his plea was true. But the old case of Roberts v. Wa
ters, 1 Yerg. 200, where the damages were left blank in a declaration in cove
nant, and the defect was pointed out by special demurrer, held,that the plaintiff
failing to amend, proceeded at his peril; and reversed the judgment and dismissed
the suit. And in Carn v. Kersey, 1 Yerg. 448, where the writ and declaration
failed to set out the christain names of two of the defendants, and this defect had
been demurred to unscccessfully below, the Supreme Court sustained the demurrer,
and refused to remand to amend, on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of

culpable negligence in failing to amend below, and because “this court will
not remand a cause for amendment, which might or might not, be asked below -,“
and so dismissed the suit. In Huff v. Lake, 9 Humph. 137, which was an eject
ment suit, the court below having erroneously refused a judgment by default, but

gtren judgment that the suit abate, the Supreme Court could not give the judg
ment that the Circuit Court should have given, because the ﬁctitious lease laid in
the declaration had expired; but remanded the cause to be amended in this partic
ular, and proceeded in. New this ﬁction in ejectment is abolished. See @3232,

also 3 3237.

§ 2873. Any defect in entering a verdict where there are £)ecrf€pct‘sln
different issues, or the verdict is not responsive to the issues,
'
shall be objected to before judgment is entered, or the objec
tion will be considered as waived. [Ib., § 7.]
Amendment ofverdt'ct.—The Court has no power to amend the verdict after the
jury has been discharged. Any substantial change thus made in a verdict is the

act of the court, and not the result of the operation of the mind of the jury,
Such a practice would result in substituting the judgment of the court in the trial

of facts for that of the jury.

Barnard r. Young, 1 Humph. 500.

But in the old

§ 0586 of Berry v. Wallin, 1 Tenn. 241, it was held, that the word “ entry)’ or “ grant,”
might be inserted in a verdicta few minutes after the jury had retired, “ the court
being unanimous and conﬁdent as to their impression of the ﬁnding."-—Where
there are no iuuel, the verdict is nullity, and no judgment can be rendered thereon.

Johnson v. Plan

But the statute of jeofaila of 1809, ch. 49, Q21,

did not inhibit the Supreme Court from reversing where the suithad been brought

in the wrong form of action. Wilson v. Smith, 5 Yerg. 879, 395. Absence of
plea matter of form, when. See note to § 2872.

§ 2875. In appeals from Justices of the Peace, the Oll'Cl1ltg::ge;:gpro

Court shall supply any defect in the proceedings of the inferior jurisdiction, as though the suit had been commenced in
the Circuit Court.
Where an appeal was granted by a justice. but the entr_v did not show to what
court, but the bond did, the defect was amendable under the Act 0f1821, ch. 21.

Rogers v. Cochran, 8 Yerg. 311. But the Act of 1821 did not authorize an entryof
appeal where no entry had been made by the justice allowing it, and the only evi
dence that it had been prayed and granted was the recital in the condition of the ap
peal bond. Ib. But the above section would authorize the court, whereit appeared

that an appeal had been prayed and granted within the time, if the bond were in
formal or irregular, to have tho same amended and perfected rather than dismiss
the appeal. Carver v. Jenkins, 2 Heisk. 629, 632. And where a Justice was ex
amined in the Circuit Court, and proved that he granted an appeal on the day of
the judgment, and delivered a draft of the appeal bond to the appellant on that
day, and of that date, which the appellant afterwards delivered to him executed,
not on the day it bore date, but after the expiration of the two days allowed by
law for appeal, the Justice should be allowed to amend, so as to show that he did
grant the appeal. Ib., 629-30. And see § 4178, and note. After verdict and
judgment and new trial granted, the warrant may be amended by inserting the

christian names of the plaintiffs.

Irwin v. Sanders, 5 Yerg. 287.

And it is com

petent to amend aJustice’s warrant in the Circuit Court by inserting the surname
of the defendant, when it has been casually omitted; but the terms of such an

amendment are in the discretion of the court, as to costs ; and the opposite party
will be protected from surprise or prejudice. Jones v. Miller, 1 Swan, 319.
Certiorari and Supersedeas.—Amendments to petitions for ceriiorari, like those
to answers in Chancery, should be very guardedly awarded, and the Supreme
Court will not readily revise the discretion of the Circuit Judge over a question

of practice of this sort; but the Circuit Judge having granted such an amend
ment, cannot afterwards disregard it on a motion to dismiss. Steel v. West, 7
Humph. 109. But if the bond for certiorari is defective, as where the obligors
have signed and sealed it above the condition, the Circuit Court will permit a

new one to be given. Lima v. Pinkston, 1 Tenn. 344 ; Jennings v. Pray, 8 Yerg.

§ 2878. Every" mistake apparent on the face of the record
may be corrected by the court at any term after ﬁnal udgment,
at the discretion of the court. [Ib.]

And see §4501.—Before the above Act, it was held that there were but two
ways in which the Supreme Court could correct its judgments at a term subsequent
to their rendition: one at common law, where the entry was a misprision of the
clerk ; the other undcr Mr. Nicholson's law to authorize the Supreme Court to do
justice in certain cases [infra, Q 4501.] )‘[cNew's Executors v. Rogers, 1 Thomp
son’s Cases, 56. The Supreme Court had no power over the record, except to

amend by matter of record.

Ballen v. Farnsworth, 1 Thompson's Cases, 84; Wil

liams v. Tenpenny, 11 Humph. 176, 179. The rough notes of the Circuit Judge
were not matte-rof record, but merely evidence inpais. 1 Thomp. Cas. 85. Thus,
where the clerk entered judgment fora different amount than that returned by the

jury, it could not be corrected by the Judge's rough minutes, corroborated by oral
testimony. ll Humph. 176. Nor would the Supreme Court remand a cause to the
end that an entry of record disposing of a motion to dismiss for chnmperty might
be supplied ; it appearing that the record below did not show the disposition of
the motion, but that the rough minutes did. 1 Thomp. Cas. 84. And where the
transcript showed that the judgment against executors in the court below was en.

tered dc bonispropriis whereas it was suggested that by the record below the judg~
ment below was do bonis tcstatoris, the Supreme Court, at aterm subsequent to the
aﬂirmance of such judgment had no power to correct it, and would not. award cor

tiorari for the corrected record below.

§ 1 Thomp. Cas. 56.

In Farris v. Kilpat.

rick, 1 Humph. 879, the Supreme Court amended by inspection of the record, an
omission of its own clerk of a sum awarded by the judgment of theCircuit Court
asdamages, on aﬂirming the judgment of the County Court. And in Crutchtield
v. Stewart, 1 Humph. 380, where the clerk of the Supreme Court had by mistake
entered a judgment of ailirmance, when, in fact, the judgment rendered was one of
reversal, as was addmitted by opposing counsel and as appeared from the written
opinion tiled witlrthe papers, the Supreme Court after much hesitation, and the
examination of many cases, English and American, ordered it corrected, on the
ground that the opinion was in the nature of a record, which the court might
look to for this purpose. See 11 Humph. 178-9. But ajudgment could not be
corrected by documentary evidence ﬁled with papers, as a constable‘s bond. Ridge
way v. Ward, 4 Humph. 430. And where two judgments before a Justice of the
Peace against a constable and his sureties were appealed from, and in the Circuit
Court were consolidated; and an entry appeared of record in which the sureties
were not named, aﬂirming the judgment of thejustice “ by consent of parties ; "
and at a subsequent term, the Circuit Court, on motion of the plaintiff‘, amended
thejudgment by inserting sjudgment against the snreties, this was error, and
ground of reversal; for it did not appear that the judgment was not purposely en

tered sgainst the constable alone. Ib.
And the above statute, as it originally stood, meant nothing more than that after
the record is made up and the term closed, the record admits of no alteration by
' the same court, unless for some mistake patent upon thc face of the record or
proceedings in the case. State v. Disney, 5 Sneed, 598, 601. If a mistake occurs in
making up the record, it may be corrected by the court during the term in which
the judgment was rendered; for during that term the record is said to be “in

the breast of the Judge." Ib.

Whether a mistake has occurred in making an entry

of record, cannot be submitted to a jury, as an issue of fact under n. writ of error

cm-am nobis. Ib. The general rule is : A judgment or decree can only be changed
or altered by matter appearing in the record, or some matter in the nature of
record. An order or decree made ata term, cannot be altered at a subsequent
term, unless there is some matter in the nature of a record showing that such

judgment or entry was made, and that by the omission of the clerk it was neg.
lected to be entered. llcGavock v. Puryear, 6 Cold. 84, 88-9.
In Elliot v. Cochran, 1 Cold. 889, where the Clerk of the Supreme Court, in
stating an account, had made a mistake in computing interest, which escaped the
detection of the court and counsel, and passed into the ﬁnal decree, it was held,
that the court had power to correct the mistake ata subsequent term. And upon
a review of several authorities, English and American, including some of our own,
it was held, that upon principle, it has always been allowed to correct the mere
mistake of the clerk, where it was apparent upon the record. In this respect the
Act of 1855-6, ch. 70, does not enlarge the powers of the court at common law.
But the court say, as to errors in tliojudg'meni of the court, in point of law ex
isting in the decree upon which the report is based, or in unwarranted deductions
of fact,—thcy are beyond our reach. The law of the decree, as well as its conclu
sions upon the testimony, constitute the deliberatejudgmcnt oftlu court in the
case, and cannot after the expiration of the term be changed ; for litigation must
stop somewhere. lb.
As curly as Edmonsbn Y. King, 1 Tenn. 425, it was held that misprisions of the
clerk, as errors in calculation, might be corrected at asubsequent term, by motion
in a summary manner. The proper course is, to suspend the execution of the
judgment by aupersedras, which in this case is an independent writ, and not aux
iliary to a certiorari, and takes the place of the old audita querela, and which a
single Judge may grant upon security; and upon return of the same, the matter
of complaint can be inquired into in a summary manner, and justice done, as on

motion.

Ib.

And this course was pursued in Elliot v. Cochrnn,ut supra.

A court may at a subsequent term correct a judgment against an administrator
which a clerk by mistake entered dc bonia prop;-iii, instead of rle bonis ieslaloria.
' Blake v. Dunn, 5 Hnmph. 678. The Act of 180], ch. 6, Q 64, [Q 3107,] docs not
cmbrnce crrors arising from misprisions of the clcrlr, and the suing out of an in
junction is no release of such errors. Ib.

Objectionable words which do not add to the force of the judgnent, and which,
ifcxcludcd, would not change its operation and effect, may, under the above sce
tion, be rejected as surplusage, either by the court in winch the judgment was ren
dered, or by the revising court. Enoch v. Fly, 2 Cold. 486, 490.

sist, under our Code and the modem system of pleading, in the stating of several
separate and distinct grounds of action or defense in the cams count, or in a single
plea or replication. Doekery V. Miller, 9 Humph. 731, 735; Pilclier v. Hart, 1

§ 215; 1 Chit. Pl., 532. And there are some qualiﬁcations to this deﬁnition. See Q
§ 2898, and note; Q 2939, Form 12; Ib., Form 8; Q 2907, and note; Cur. Lawsuit
§§ 112, 113.——A plea which presents two issues, one oflaw and the other of fnct—
one to the court, and the other to the jury, is bad for duplicity, and should be
stricken out under the above section. Trabue v. Higden, 4 Cold. 620, 625. It is
error to refuse, on motion, to strike out s plea bad for duplicity. lb.
“Irrelevant. "--1 Chit. Pl. 228. An amended plea which is irrelevant will not
be received. Blakemore v. Wood, 3 Sneed, 470, 474. And see note to § 2863.
“ Frivolous. "—A frivolous plea would have been stricken out before the Code.
Beard v. Young, 2 Tenn. 54 ; Douglass v. Belcher, 7 Ycrg. 105. Butit was doubted
whether it would be proper to strike out a frivolous demurrer, where the party
applied for time to argue it, under the Act of 1794, ch. 1, Q 26; 9. Tenn. 54. Pleas
“in short,” as nil debit,” “ payment, ” “ set-off, ” etc., are frivolous, and should
be stricken out by the Judge of his own motion. Grant v. Jennings, 1 Cold. 53
See “Pleaain short” under Q 2906. A plea which commences in bar and con

cludes in abatement was before the Code, a plea in bar; and if it contained no
matter in bar, it was frivolous, and should have been stricken out. 7 Yerg. 105.
But now see Q 2908. Immaterial pleas may also be stricken out; but if such a plea
be improperly stricken out, and the defendant permitted, under a less appropriate

plea, to avail himself of all matters of defense upon which he saw ﬁt to rely, the
action of the court below in improperly rejecting the plea, is not error affecting

the merits for which the Supreme Court will reverse. Sanders v. McFerrin, 1 Head,
§ 219.

And see Clark v. Bell, 8 Humph. 26, 28.

Any pleading which tenders an

immaterial issue may be struck out as frivolous. Car. Lawsuit, Q 238. For no
judgment can be pronounced on a verdict on such an issue, but only a judgment of
repleader. Trott v. West, Meigs, 163, 169. But a repleader will not be granted at
the instance of the party who pleaded the immaterial plea. Nixon v. Bullock, 9

Yerg. 414, 416.

Duty of court.

§ 2883. It is the duty of the court to see that the rules of
pleading are substantially adhered to, and for this purpose it
is empowered to impose terms upon delinquents.
As to the terms of amendment, see Q 2867, and note; Q 2870. Concerning
the desirability and necessity of good pleading, see Roberts v. Stewart, 1 Yerg.
§ 390; Anderson v. Read, 2 Tenn. 205, 207; Webber v. Houston, 6 Yerg. 814,
§ 316; Haupin v. Whitson, 2 Ileisk. 1, 2. But for the reason that the subject is
exhausted, the court would again admonish the bar, of the beauty and necessity
of adhering to special pleading.

Peck. J., in 6 Yerg. 316.

And while we ad

monish the bar, infer-ioi-jurixdictioras will ﬁnd it important in cases before them,
to see that issues are so taken that the proceedings may be sensible, and thereby
the means of doing justice the more certainly attained. The same Judge in l.

Yerg. 393.

Demoralization has always grown out of the Code system of plead

ing, and will further result from it, nnleos the courts require those of the profes
sion who prefer to plead under it, to adhere strictly to its requirements. It
would be better for the rights of parties, and the purity of the law, if we could
retum to the ancient way-—treat pleading as a science, and the only true ground
on which the proper administration of the law can permanently stand. Tumey
J., in 2 Heisk. 8, 4, But in West v. Taylor, 2 Cold, 96,100, after stating the ob

ject of the Legislature, in enacting the provisions of the Code on the subject of
pleading, to have been to abolish the technicalities and avoid the perplexities of
the old forms ofpleading, and to abridge and simplify the pleading and practice
in courts of justice, the court say that this end they would give the provisions of
the Code a fair and natural construction. So complete and thorough has been
the departure, [under the Codes] from the former rules and forms of pleading,
that it is hardly safe to rely upon analogies derived from that system in giving prac
tical effect to the new. Based as the new is upon an entirely drferent theory,
and having profcssedly different ends to accomplish, it is better with a view to
carry it out in its spirit, to consider_it as it is in truth an entire new theory, to

be construed and carried into effect according to its terms and upon principles
peculiar to itself. Difficult as it may be for a mind trained to the logical and
vruly scientiﬁc rules of pleading under which justice has so long been administered
in States and countries in which thocommon law has had away, to cast aside all the
mics which have been supposed to be founded in wisdom, and in practice to have
accomplished a good purpose, for a new and confessedly imperfect scheme, it is
safe to say that it must be done, in order to give effect to the provisions referred
to, and give t/he new system a fair trial; and that less injustice will be done in
that way, than by attempting to eagraft the new upon the old, which can only be
done to the prejudice of both. Bush v. Presser, 1 Kern. 351.

bad for uncertainty, and may ‘be reached by demurrer; and the Supreme Court,

on sustaining the demurrer in such a case, will not aid such culpable negligence
in pleading, by remanding to amend. Cain v. Kearscy, 1 Ycrg.443. In populous
cities it is even desirable to add a description to the surname, according to the
ancient English practice. Ib. This under the old law was ground of special de
murrer for insufficiency of form. 3 Rob. Prac. 519. But is abolished, [i 2865,]
and the defendant would now underQ 2885, move the court to compel the plain
tiff to state the name more fully. Car. Lawsuit, Q 103.—In suits on written instru
ments, the name and description used in the instrument are sufficient. Q 2788.
Debt not due.—The declaration must show'that the debt is due. See the

forms of declaration, infra, Q 2939, Forms 1 to 7.

If commenced before the

debt is due, the action is not maintainable. Bell v. Bullion, 2 Yerg. 479 ; Love v.
Nelson, Mart. It Yerg. 237; Carter v. Tamer, 2 Head, 62; Coleman v. Ewing, 4
Humph. 241; Green v. Demoss, 10 Humph. 871, 3'77; Blevins v. Alexander, 4
Sneed, 588; Arnold v. Elliot, 7 Humph. 854. Andifthe fact that the debt is not

due appear on the face of the proceeding, it may be taken advantage of by de
murrer; otherwisc by plea in abatement; or it may beobjected to on trial. 1 Head.
§ 53. Or if not taken advantage of in this way, it is a fatal error, for which judg
mentwill bearrested, or reversed on error. 2 Yerg. 479. The only authority which
holds directly that the prematurity of the action must be objected to baforethe

judgment, is Carter v. Turner, 2 Head, 52, which cites 1 Chit. Pl. 453, an authority
which does not sustain the position; nor does this position seem to be sustained
by any of our other cases. Their eﬁ'ect is shown in ll_eiskcll’s Digest, p. 21, Q 35.
Dq/"eats cm-ed by ¢wcrment.—Au imperfect and erroneous description of the
name of a party toa note, bill or bond, may be cured by avermen t, and often by

intendmeut. Rice v. Rag-land, 10 Humph. 545, 650.

As where a bill was drawn

on a corporation by a mistaken name, and accepted by them in their true name.
Or where a note was drawn payable to a corporation in a mistaken name. In such
case the corporation may declare in its true name, and aver that the note was
made payable to it by the name used in the note. Bank of Tenn. v. Burke, 1

§ 2892. Either party may, by leave of the court, on good
cause shown, make a supplemental pleading, alleging any ma

terial facts which have happened or have come to his knowl
edge since the ﬁling of his former pleading; nor shall such

new pleading on the part of the defendant be considered a
waiver of former defences.
Before the Code, it was held that the application of the plaintiifto be permitted
to ﬁle an amended declaration, and of the defendant for leave to plead thereto, was

to be regarded as a mutual and voluntary abandonment of the pleadings on both
sides ; consequently the defendant. was not entitled to have his previous plea re
garded as a defense to the amended declarationfand the plaintiﬂ’ was entitled to
judgment by default, unless by some subsequent act he had manifested an inten
tion of adopting and relying upon it as such. Robinson v. Keys, 9 Humph. 144.
But an agreement waiving all errors precludes the party from going back to an er
mr in pleading, on motion in arrest of judgment. Ward v. Crenshaw, 4 Yerg.
§ 197. And a plea since the last continuance was a. waiver, and in legal effect, a
withdrawal of all former defenses; and this, although such plea was an answer
to only a part of the plaintiffs demand. There was no authority for holding that

such a partial plea was only a waiver pro tunic.

Sanderlin v. Dnndridge, 3

Humph. 99. But this general rule held only where the pica was properly plead
ed. Thus, where after issue joined a cause had been suffered by both parties to
slumber many years on the appearance docket, and a plea puis darrain continu
ance was filed to test the question whether the cause was not thereby discontin

ued, this was not n waiver of former defenses. Pierce v. Bank of Tennessee, ‘l
Swan, 265, 268.
But Ute above section changes the rule of the common law under which a plea
since the last continuance is a waiver of all former pleas. Susong v. Jack, 1
Heisk. 415, 417.--The Supreme Court will not, unless good cause appear, revise
the discretion of the Circuit Court, in permitting supplemental pleadings embrac
ed in the above section to be ﬁled at any time bcﬁsre trial; but if a plea since

the last continuance is not sworn to as provided in Q 2909, it is ground of rever
sal. Caldwell r. Richmond, 1 lieisk. 468, 471. See also as to abandonment of
pleas, Q 4240, and note.
The discretionary power of the courts to allow amendments extends to cases
where the defendant has not actually appeared, to the same extent as in other
cases; for a defendant duly served with process is supposed to be in court from
the return day until ﬁnal judginent, Fowlkes v. Webber, 8 Humph. 536, 533, in
substance.

§ 2893. Profcrt shall be required as heretofore, and a de- Profert.
murrcr may be ﬁled for want thereof. [Act 1819, ch. 27, §2.]
“As heretofore." The law in force on this subject at the time of the Code was
as follows :—
.
“ In nil cases, whether the action is commenced before n. Justice of the Peace or
court of record having jurisdiction thereof‘, the plain tiff shall be compelled to pro
duce auy instrument of writing, not under seal, within the power of the party to

produce, upon which his, her or their action is founded; if said cause is pending
before it Justice ofthe Peace, upon trial of such cause; and ifthe cause is pending
in a court of record, at the return term; and make profert of the some in his, her
or their declaration, unless longer time is given.” [Act l8l9, ch. 27, Q 2; Car. 5|;

.\’ich. 551.]

The remaining provisions of this Act are carried into the Code at Q

§ 3901, ct seq. The variance in pleading by this Act is that the profert is required to
be made of unsealal instruments which are the foundation of its action; whereas,
at common law such instruments are not required to be shown by way of profert.
Our statutory law varies from the common law in re.q)ect of profert no further
than is declared by this Act. Gardner v. Henry, 5 Cold. 458. In Everiy v.

Marnble, 2 Yerg. 113, this Act was held conclusive; and where the declaration set
out the instrument sued on, but did not make profert of it, it was bad on special
dernurrer.—-And at common law :1 demurrer lies for want of profert. Williams v.
Bryan, 5 Gold. 104, 106. But the want of profert, or an aﬂidavit excusing the omission of profert, can only be taken nd\'antng‘o of in this way, and is cured by
verdict. Lowry v. Medlin, 61-Iumph. 450; Union Bank v. Osborne, 6 Humph. 318,
And is waived by pleading to the merits. And if the defendant sets out the con
ditions of the instrument in his plea to the merits, it is the some as though it were
in court upon 03/er. Cherry v. Mann, Cooke, 268; Nichol v. White, 4 Hayw.

§ 257.

Profert must be made of the original instrument, and not a copy, and if it

appear on oyer that the instrument sued on is acopy, the decl.-ration is bad on de
murrer, although during the argument of the demurrer, the pl:tintifi' produces the
original in court. Jones v. Simmons, 4 Humph. 314. The plaintiﬂ‘ is bound to

make profert ofand produce in court the instrument sued on, if he has it in his
possession; but the omission tojile it with the declaration cannot be reached by
demurrer, if profert is made in proper form. A demurrer for this cause is “ an
absurd practice,” and should be taken from the ﬁles. Andeison v. Allison, 2

Head,l22; Williams 1'. Bryan, 5 Cold. 104, 106.

Or such a demurrer may be

treated as frivolous, or disregarded altogether. 5 Cold. 106. But if the plaintiff
fails to ﬁle the instrument, the defendant may ask to have his demand of 03/er en
tered, which would operate in the nature of a plea, and upon which he may de

mand thejudgment of the court, whether or not he is bound to answer without
it.
Profert is ezmued in the following cases :—
§ 1. Where the instrument is lost or mislaid; in which case it may he supplied by
aﬁidavit, under Q 3901, which see. In such case suit should be brought on the
instrument, as though it were present; to declare on the original consideration is
bad. Powers v. Fitzhugh, 10 Humph. 415. Bnta count on a note may be joined
with a count on the original consideration. Kennel v. Muncey, Peck, 273. For

the execution ofa note does not extinguish the precedent demand. Nichol v.
Thompson, 1 Yerg. 151, 154. Nor does an order. Harwell v. llctlulloch, 2 Tenn.
§ 275. A defective a-fﬁdavit used as a substitute for prolert may he amended.
Murlock v. Brown, 7 Humph. 61, 63.
§ 2. Where the instrument is in possession of the opposite party; as to which, see

§ 3902, and note.
Oym-.—When profert is offered to the declaration, o_1/er is then, and only then
demandnhle. Williams 1'. Bryan, 6 Cold. 104, 107; Steph. P}. 69. And ifit be
denied when it ought to be granted, the party making the claim should more the
court to have the prayer of oyer entered of record, which entry is in the nature of
a plea; and the plnintifhnay couuterplead the right to 0,1/er, or strike out the rest
of the pleading following the oyer, and demur; upon which the judgment of the

court is that the defendant have oyer, orthat he answer without it. Ib.

And see

Anderson v. Allison, 1 Head, 122. A demurrer, which craves oyer of a note
without setting it out, does not make ita part of the record. Story v. Dobson, 2
Heisk. 29. To show a variance between the otligntion declared on, and the one
produced on the trial, 0_|/$1‘ thereof must be craved, the instrument set out, and
thereby made a part of the record. McConnell v. Read, Mart. dt Yerg. 224. And
the cases are numerous which hold that the Supreme Court will not notice the

clerk's recital of a note, not mude part of the record by the pleadings,—that is,
o_r/er or bill of exceptions. Mart. & Yerg. 224 ; Anderson v. Walker, Mart. & Yerg.
§ 201; Allen v. State, Ib., 294 ; Union Bank v. Lowe, Meigs, 225 ; Martin v. Bank of
Tennessee, 2 Cold. 332. The original attachment and aﬁidavit by which a suit
iscommenced, being a part of the record of the court, will be looked to without
being set out on oyer. Kincaid v. Francis, Cooke, 49, 50. Nor is it necessary in
suing on a domestic judgment, to set out the original papers or an exempliﬁca
tion of them. Gardner v. Henry, 5 Cold. 458. But although oycr cannot be de
manded of a record in general, yet an injunction bond taken in an equity case is the property oi‘ the obligee named in it, and may be demanded by him to be sued
on in another oourt; and having brought suit on it in another court, oyer may
be demanded of it. Ramsay v. White, 4 Hayw. 257.

Eject of o_1/er—variance—dcmurrer.—It‘ the instrument thus set out is variant
from the declaration, or if the completed declaration show no cause of action, it

may be taken advantage of by demurrer, or plea in abatement. See Haley v.
Long, Peck, 93; Degraifenreid v. Mays, 6 Yerg. 465 ; Ilenshawv. Lewis, 4 Hayw.
§ 242; Jones v. Simmons, 4 Humph. 314; Martin v. Bank of Tenn., 2 Cold. 332;
Williams v. Brown, 5 Cold. 104, 107. Formerly the demurrer in some instances
was general. Peck, 93—but now all demurrers must be special. Q 2984.

If a person be bound by bond with a penalty, conditioned to be discharged by

the penalty, to be satisﬁed by the payment of the installment due, and the other

installments as they fall due, for which acire facias may be sued out. Cocke V.
Stuart, 2 Tenn. 231. But, it seems, that if a person is bound by bill single to
pay a sum of money by installments, suit will not lie until the last installment is

due; for the contract is entire. Ib.

Successive recoveries may be had upon a

penal bond, but these recoveries must not, in the aggregate, exceed the penalty.

§ 2900. In actions for tho conversion or detention of P81‘-Foroonverslon

or delcnllou ol

sonal property, 1t is suﬁicient to state in the declaration the 1>¢mw=1lr
kind of property, that it belongs to the plaintiff, and has been
detained by the defendant or converted to his nse.

[Act 1851-2, ch. 152, § 3.]
Before this statute, it was held that in trover against an oﬂicer for seizing and
selling under fi. fa. a horse exempt from execution, it was necessary to allege

that plaintiﬂ‘ was the head of a family. Pollard v. Thomason, 5 Humph. 66.

See

Q 2939, Form 9, and note.
§ 2901. No plea in abatement shall be received in any :;.,,n,e.-,...,.,,
court, unless its truth is veriﬁed by the oath of the party or 0'
otherwise. [Act 1794, ch. 1, § 26.]
Vn-i_/z'cation.—That is, by affidavit when the matter is in pais, and by record

when the matter is of record. Grove v. Campbell, 9 Yerg. 7, 10.

Indeed it is not

necessary to plead any matter in abatement which appears on the face of the
record. Parker v. Porter, 4 Yerg. 81, 83; Carter v. Turner, 2 Head, 52, 54. And
see Bank of Alabama v. Fitzpatrick, 4 Humph. 811 ; Bennett v. Avnnt, 2 Sneed,

§ 152.

If the plea is not properly veriﬁed, it may be treated as a nullity, or struck

out on motion. Friedlander v. Pollock, 5 Cold. 490, 495;Young v. Stringer, 5
Hayw. 30, 32; Bank of'I‘ennessee v. Jones, l Swan, 391-2; Trabue v. Higden, 4

Cold. 620, 623. The fact that the phraseology of the above section is changed
from that of the original act, does not in any degree change the rule on this sub
ject. 4 Cold. 623. For in changing the phraseology, no change of substance was
intended to be made. 5 Cold. 495.—But if the veriﬁcation is defective, and the
plaintiff treats it as a valid plea, and takes testimony and goes to a hearing upon

it, [in chancery,] the objection is considered as waived.
§ 81, 38-4.
“ Oath of like party or oﬂieru'iu.”—The words of the originil Act were, “un
less the party otfering the same shall prove the truth of such plea, by ath

davit or otherwise." Under the original Act it was held that the aﬂidavit might
be made by an attorney or agent of the defendant, if the facts constituting the
foundation of the plea were within his personal knowledge. Bank of Tennessee v.
Jones, 1 Swan, 391-2. But the aﬂidavit must be positive, as to the truth of every
fact contained in the plea, and should leave nothing to be collected by inference.
It must be stated that the plea is true in substance and in fact. Ib. The state
ment in the aﬂidsvit to such a plea, made by a third person who does not pur
port to be either the attorney or agent of the defendant, that he “is informed
and_ believes” that the plea is true in substance and in fact, is no compliance with

the statute. Ib.

The veriﬁcation, “ sworn to and subscribed before me, January

the 9th" etc., is a nullity. 4 Cold. 622-8; 5 Cold. 495.—'l'he word “ aﬂidavit” in
the original Act meant an oath reducedto writirtg. Hence, although pleadings be
fore u justice are are tmus, yet it was held that in all cases brought by appeal
from a justice to s. court of record, matter in abatement cannot be taken advan
tage of unless it be set forth in writing, and veriﬁed by oath, or otherwise at the
ﬁrst term of the court to which the appeal is taken. 9 Yerg. 10. And it seems
from a later case that it should be filed before thejustice, in order to be available
in the Circuit Court. Settle v. Settle, 10 Humph. 504, 506. And this position
would seem to be strengthened by Neville v. Northcutt, 7 Cold. 294, 298, which
states the rule to be that pleadings before justices arc ore Imus, except in cases

where it is required that the plea shall be under oath.
Causes of plea.

Process on
Sunday.

§ 2902. Actions may be abated by plea of the defendant in
the following cases:
'
§ 1. Where the process is issued or served on Sunday,
[except] in the cases prescribed in section 2836. [Or 2824 ?]
[Act 1777, ch. 8, § 6.]
For a form of plea under this sub-section, see Cur. Lawsuit, Q 185. The aver
ment in a plea in abatement that the process issued on the 15th of December, the

Sabbath, as appears by the endorsement thereon, is a suﬂicient averment that it in
fact issued on the 15th of December. Helm v. Rodgers, 5 Humph. 105. Such a
plea may be amended in matter of form, or the court may in its discretion refuse
to permit it to be amended. Ib. And see Rainey v. Sanders, 4 Humph. 447.
Or while de
fendant a wits
noss, etc.

§ 2. Where the process is served upon the defendant while
attending his duty at a muster of militia’, or election, or as
wi[',n(\.SS 0!'jl1l'0l‘.

D

A subpoena to answer in chancery served upon defendant while in attend
ance nndcr subpoena as a witness in the Circuit Court, is within the statute,
[Q 3828,] and to disallow s. plea in abatement for this cause is error. Martin v.
Ramsey, 7 Humph. 260. But great strictness will be required in aplea of this
kind. It must show in what suit, or for which party he was attending ns a wit
ness, that the suit was then pending, and in what court. Baker v. Compton,
§ 2 Head, 471, 473. See Q 8828. But. it is held in Grove v. Campbell, 7 Yerg. 7, 9,
that the fact that the defendant was attending court as a juror at the time the
summons was served upon him, cannot be pleaded in abatement. Seeé 4002,

and note.
Local actions.

§ 3. \Vherc suits, local in their nature, are brought in a dif
ferent county from that required by law.
See Q 2810, and note.

§ 2903. But this enumeration is not intended to exclude pgigig,-:52;
any cause of abatement now recognized by law.
I
Other grounds of abntrnient :—
§ 4
§ 1. ﬁﬁlmomer of the plaintiffs in a motion against a sheriff; and this being mat
ter of abatement cannot be reached on error. Marshall v. Hill, 8 Yerg. 101, 108.
Eﬂect of pleadingin abatement because of misnomer of tenant in ejectment under
the old practice. Dixon v. Cavanaugh, 1 Tenn. 865-6. A plea in abatement for

misnomer must disclose the true name. 1 Tenn. 366; State v. Hughes, 1 Sivan,
§ 261. And it is a good replication that he is known by the name'used as well as
by the other. Lewis v. State, 1 Head, 329, 831.
§ 2. T0 an attachment, that it issued without affidavit and bond as prescribed by
statute. Sec Q 3476, and note, where the cases on pleas in abatement to attach
ments, are collected.
§ 3. That the original process was served less than ﬁve da-ys from the return day.

See Boyd v. Buckingham. 10 Humph. 434, 436.

But it is not a good plea in -
abatement that it does not appear from the return of the writ that the requisite
time had elapsed between service and the ﬁrst day of the term; for the statute
does not require that it shall appear on the writ when it was executed ; and the
court will presume that the otﬁeer did his duty. The plea should set forth the

fact that the writ was not executed in time. Nelson v. Cummins, 1 Tenn. 436. §
§ 2930, and note.
§ 4. That the sum sued for is less than the smallest amount of which the court
has jurisdiction. It is always presumable that the sum in dispute is as well known
to the defendant as to the plaintiff‘. If, therefore, the defendant knows that the
action is brought for a sum under the jurisdiction of the court, no matter what may
be the sum laid in the writ and declaration, he has the right to put the question
ofjurisdiction in issue by plea in abatement, resting the point upon the sum in
dispute, and if he does not do so, the objection is waived, and cured by verdict.
Covington v. Neilson, 6 Yerg. 47 5. And see Bacon v. Parker, 2 Tenn. 65. And
under the Act of 1803, ch. 5, Q 2, [omitted from the Code,] the fact that a ver
dict was rendered for :1 sum smaller than the minimum amount of which the
court had jurisdiction, was not fatal in arrest ofjudgment; the jurisdiction ofthe
court for this cause could only be questioned by plea in abatement. Martin v.
Carter, 1 Yerg. 489.

§ 5. In a suit against heirs on a covenant in their ancestor’s deed, the fact that
all the heirs are not joined; for all the heirs constitute but one representative of
the ancestor, and their liability upon his covenant of warranty is, in its nature,

joint, and was not made several by the Act of 1789, ch. 57, [supra., Q2789]
House v. Mitchell, Meigs, 138.

§ 6. That in an action for injuries to land, all the tenants in common do not join;
and advantage can only be taken of the nmi-joinder, by pleu in abatement; and if
that be omitted, and the defendantplead in bar, the objection cannot be taken in

any other form.

Winters v. McGhec, 8Sneed, 128, 130.

§ 7. Where the defendant is brought into court by counterpart summons, under
Act of 1820, ch. 25, that the leading writ was served on anon-resident. of the State.
Shelby v. Johnson, 7 Humph. 503. But query by the editors, whether this plea
is maintainable under this Act as modiﬁed in Q 2821, supra .9 See that section and
note.
§ 8. That the debt was not due at the time suit was brought. Reed v. Brawner,
Peck, 275. “ But as these matters are also ground of demurrer or non-.~mi1, it is
now very unusual to plead them in abatement." 1 Chit. Pl. 453 ; cited errone

ously in Carter v. Turner, 2 Head, 62, 54, as sustaining the position that this ob
jection mu-st be made by plea in abatement, or where the fact is apparent on the
face of the record, by demurrer; whereas the driﬂ. of our authorities is, that suing
before the debt is due or contract broken is fatal after verdict, and on error. See

note to Q 2884, sub-head, “Debt notdue”; Heisk. Dig. pp. 10, 11, 21.
§ 9. Coverture; as where afemc covert is sued alone on an obligation executed
while sole. But if the obligation were executed subsequent to and during the cov
erture, this creates no right of action either against thefeme or her husband; and
if this fact do not appear in the declaration, a. plea in bar is the proper defense;
but ifit appear in the declaration, it may be taken advantage of by demurrer or

motion in arrest of judgment.

Shepherd v. Kendall, 7 Humph. 80; same parties,

§ 10. That the plaintiffs suing as partners are not partners.
llfatlcrs not good in abafemenl :—

Q 3779 a.

l. That the writ was executed by a person who signs his name “ D. S.”; for by
universal practice these initials signify dqnizty sherzf, whose act is equivalent to
that of his principal. Nelson v. Cummins, 1 Tenn. 436. Such uplea is frivolous,
and will beset aside on motion. Ib. Or now by the court of its own motion. §
§ 2882.

§ 2. The objection in the Circuit Court that the justice who tried the cause below
was incompetent to sit, because of being related to one of the parties; for the ob

jection not having been made below is considered as waived; and since the trial in
the Circuit Court is de nova, it has ceased to be of any utility.
Swan, 173.

Wroe v. Greer, 2

Jlanncr and time ofpleading.—If the matter ofthe plea is personal privilege, it
must be pleaded in person. See note to} 2812. Pleas in abatement must'alwa_vs
be ﬁled at the rig/it time, in the right form, and properly veriﬁed. Grove v. Camp
bell, 9 Yerg. 7, 10. A plea in abatement cannot be received after a general con
tinuance; and a rule to plead and try at the next. term is equivalent to n general
continuance. Shaw v. Bowen, 1 Tenn. 249. And it must be ﬁled before plead
ing in bar, unless the matter in abatement arose after the plea in bar. Yancey v.
Marriott, 1 Sneed. 28, 40. Thus, where a party was sued in a county, other than
that of his residence by counterpart writ, and after judgment by default had been

set aside, a twllc prosequi was entered as to the lending defendant, resident of the
county of the venue, the other defendant might then plead in abatement the want
ofjurisdiction. Ib. And see note to Q 2860. And if it is ﬁled at the same time '
with a plea in bar, it is waived by the plea in bar. Douglass v. Belcher, 7 Yerg.
§ 105; Morgan v. McCarty, 3 Humph. 146. In cases appealed from justices, they
must be ﬁled at the term to which the appeal is taken. 9 Yerg. 10. And a plea in
the Circuit Court that the justice who tried the cause was incompetent, comes too

late.

Time of pleading in abatement in attaclmwnt came. See note under§ 8476.

§ 336. Either on motion of the plaintiﬁ‘, or by the court of its own motion. Q 2882.
Otherwise the judgment is
§ 1. That the writ be abated. Roberts v. Stewart, 1 Yerg. 390, 898. That is, if
the defendant pleads iu abatement to the plaintitfs suit and succeeds, the plaintiﬁ'
is put out of court. 5 Cold. 126.

§ 2. Or, a reapondeas ouster. 1 Yerg. 393.

That is, where the plea is stricken

out as frivolous, or is successfully demuried to. 5 Cold. 126; James v. Hall, 1
Swan, 297, 300; Baker v. Compton, 2 Head, 471, 478 ; Haney v. Sanders, 4 Humph,
§ 447; Nelson v. Cummins, 1 Tenn. 436-7; McBee v. State, Meigs, 122, 124.
And it is error to render a judgment ﬁnal. Ib. And this is thejudgment where
the plea has been improperly struck out, and the judgment reversed on appeal.
Chambers v. Haley, Peck, 159, 161; Bank of Tennessee v. Jones, 1 Swan, 391-2.
For after the plea in abatement is improperly stricken out, pleading to the merits
is not a waiver of the beneﬁt of the plea in abatement. Peck, 161.
§ 3. For damages. 1 Yerg. 393. That is, if the plea presents an issue of fact,
and the plaintitf accepts the issue, and a jury is called to dctermineit; or if by
consent it is determined by the Judge as ofujury, and it is found against the de
fendant, it is fatal and decisive; and the same jury should be instructed to assess
the damages, if it be a case requiring the intervention of ujury, as in other cases

ofjudgment by default. 5 Cold. 126-7; citing many authorities and stating the
reason of the rule; and citing also Bacon v. Parker, 2 Tenn. 55, where the same
doctrine is held. But see Judge Cooper's note at the end ofthis last case, (Cooper’s
Edition,) where the universal application of this rule is doubted.

§ 2904. The provisions of the foregoing section shall not apply No, do pm,lions apply to

in the cases provided for in sections 2913-2915.
Duress must be pleaded. Blair v. Coffman, 2 Tenn. 1’i6.—Thc statute qffraudl
need not be pleaded. Townsend v. Sharp, 2 Tenn. 192; Carroway v. Anderson,

the contract drawn in question were in writing or not, is mutter in evidence. Ib.
See “consideration” in note under Q 2989, Form 8. A plea offormer recover;/in
the county court in a motion on an oﬂicial bond, should set out the names of the

parties to the former proceeding with suﬂicient certainty, describe the nature of
the proceeding so as to show that the court had jurisdiction, and should conclude

§ 16.
And before the Code, they might be treated as nullities, or as good pleas, at the
option of the opposite party; and if the opposite party elected to treat them as
good pleas, the Supreme Court would so consider them. This general rule ap.
plied to all pleadings, and may be gathered from the following cases: Smith v.

Eubanks, 9 Yerg. 20, 23; Crutcher v. Williams, 4 Humph. 345; Tlieavenouglit v.
Hardeman, 4 Yerg. 565; Buyers v. Pratt, 1 Humph. 90, 92; Boon v. Planter’!
Batik, 3 Humpl1.84; Carr v. Stevenson, 5 Humph. 559; Corn v. Brazleton, 2
Swan, 273. In Nixon v. Bumpass, 5 Yerg. 16, 11 demurrer in the words, “genera!
demurrer, and special for cause, &c., to ﬁrst plea," was sustained, and the judg

ment aﬂirmed.—And the Supreme Court would not reverse, where nothing was
complained of but the neglect to make up the issues in due form, as by the use of
pleadings in short ; such informality not reaching the merits. Brinson v. Smith,
Peck, 94. And when the record showed over the appellant's signature the words
“replication and issue," this, if an error, was an error of the appellant, and not of
the court, for which the Supreme Court would not reverse. Chambers v. Ruﬂin,
Cooke, 292. And although the verdict “do ﬁnd for the plaintiff,” is not respon
sive to any issue, and is only properly returned in causes which come from jus
tices, \vhere there are no pleadings, yet if there be no suﬂicicnt issue in the
record, judgment given on such a ﬁnding will not be disturbed. Young v. Porter,
§ 5 Yerg. 98. And where the plca is in short, as “set-off,” the plaintiff is entitled
to meet any claim that may be otfered underit, with all the defences to which he
is in law entitled, as fully if they were specially replied. Thus, he may set up the statute of limitations to the cross-claim, with a replication of the statute.
Alsbrook v. Hathaway,8 Sneed, 454.
Since the Code, it has been held, construing the above section together with

{Q 2882 and 2883, that pleas “in short” are frivolous, and are to be treated as
nullities, and that it is the imperative duty of the court, whenever the question shall
properly arise, to disregard such a plea, and to order it struck out, or to proceed

to render judgment as if no such plea had been put in, either on motion of the
adverse party, or under§ 2882, of its own motion. Grant v. Jennings, 1 Cold. 53.
And notwithstanding the words, “ non-assumpsit, payment and set-oil‘ ” seem to
have been accepted by the plaintiff as pleas to the action, and the words “ rep
lication and issue” were written thereunder, it was altogether competent to the
court, either on motion of the plaintiff, or on its own more motion, to strike out
these words, or to disregard them entirely, and proceed to render judgment as
for want of a plea, or defence to the action, unless the party had shown a
meritorious defence, and a sufficient excuse for not having availed himself of it
in proper form, and at the proper time. It cannot be hold that the plaintiﬂ is
precluded by his acceptance of such pleas from afterwards disregarding them at
any time and before proceeding to trial. But if the parties sh-all choose to go
to trial upon such issues, and the court, regardless of the positive injunction
of the statute, shall tolerate them in doing so, we think the objection to such
pleading could not be taken after verdict by either party. Ib., 56. But a
demurrer “in short,” namely, the word “demurrer,” followed by the word
“joinder,” signed by the opposite counsel, is a nullity under § 2934. Johnson
v. O’Neal, 3 Head, 601.

This statute did not apply to replications. Ridley v. Buchanan, 2 Swan, 555, 558_

But see § 2932, and note.
The original Act continued, “so that he be not permitted to plead and demur
to the whole.” Under this statute the ﬁling of several distinct pleas inconsistent
with each other is allowed. Langford v. Frey, 8 Humph. 443; Kelly v. Craig, 9

Humph. 215.

As no -unques executor and non estfaclum. B Humph. 443.

Or, to

a declaration for slander, not guilty, not guilty within six months, and that the
words spoken were true. 9 Humph. 215. And a general verdict upon such pleas

will support n judgment. lb. A plea or replication is not by the common law
had for duplicity, because it states several facts, unless those facts constitute dis
tinct answers to the declaration or plea. Pilchcr v. Hart, 1 Humph. 524, 536 ; State

Bank v. Hinton, 1 Dev. 897; Torrey v. Fields, 10 Vt. 853; 1 Chit. Pl. 532. The
rule seems to be that. separate and distinct defences united in the samc pleading,
make it bad for duplicity. Dockery v. Miller, 9 Humph. 781, 735.
Jomdcr of rounl.r.—'l'he rule before the Code was that counts requiring differ
ent pleas, as not guilty and mm auumpail; or different judgments, as quad cap
iatur or in mixer-ccordia, could not be joined. The learning on this subject will
be found in Angus v. Dickerson, Mcigs, 459; Baxter v. Pope, Meigs, 407; Lane
v. Hogan, 5 Ycrg. 290; Horseley v. Branch, 1 Humph. 199, 207 ; Holland v.
Pack, Peck, 150, 154. Now, counts in tort and contract may be joined, when

ever the party is entitled to sue for a breach of the contract, or at his election for
the wrong or injury, Q 2748; or “several distinct causes of action," in which case
the court may direct separate trials of the issues. Q 2896.

Counts may bejoined

on a promissory note, and the precedent demand. Kennel v. Munccy, Peck, 273.
And see Nichol v. Thompson, 1 Yerg. 151 ; Harwell v. McCulloch, 2 Tenn. 275.
The rules of the ancient law, which discountenanced double pleading, are so fur qualiﬁed with us that the declaration may contain several counts, Q 2896; and
may join counts in tort withcounts» in contract, Q 2748; and several pleas may
be ﬁled, as above; and, by leave of the court, more than one replication may be
ﬁled, Q 2982; and certain distinct causes of action, as for goods sold, money
lent, work and labor done, etc., may be consolidated in one general statement,

as provided for in Q 2939, Form 8, and in suits on bonds or other written con
tracts, several breaches may be assigned. I 2898, and note.

§ 2882, and note. Where the plea commenced in bar, and concluded in abatement,
the plaintiff might demur either in bar orin abatement; if he adopted the former,

he might conclude his prayer in bar, and on his prayer for damages the judgment
would be ﬁnal. But where instead of a formal demurrer, a brief entry was made,'
“demurrer and joinder,” the court could not gum or hazard what the pleader
meant ; and therefore as the only possible way for reaching the merits, gave judg
ment of respondeaa ouster. Roberts v. Stewart, 1 Yerg. 390. The cases which
hold that pleas in abatement are to be taken strictly ; that no latitude is to be an
tended to them; that they are to be good in form as well as in substance, are too

numerous to repeat in a note.

See 9 Yerg. 10; 10 Humph. 506.

The rule is of

equal application in criminal as in civil cases. 10 Yerg. 627 ; 1 Head, 831. And
even in two cases since the Code, the rule is repeated, that if such a plea com
mcnccs in bar, andconcludes in abatement it is fatal. Baker v. Compton, 2 Head,
§ 471-2 ; Lewis v. State, I Head, 329, 331. But such pleas may be amended in the
discretion of tho Circuit Judge. Helm v. Rodgers, 5 Humph. 105, 107. And in
one case it is said that if an amended plea in abatement had been offered, and had

constituted a good defense to the action, the court should have allowed it to be
ﬁled. Ramsey v. Sanders, 4 Humph. 447. And now does not the above section,
in connection with the provisions of the chapter on amendments, Q 2863, ct aeq.,
abolishing objections for formal defects, indicate an intention to change the rule on

this subject ?—Eds.
Pleas to be
sworn to.

§ 2909. All pleas which deny the execution or assigiiinent by
the defendant, his agent, attorney or partner, of any instrument
in writing, the foundation of the suit, whether produced or al

leged to be lost or destroyed, and all pleas since the last con
tinuance, shall be sworn to.

[Act 1s19, ch. 27, §4; 1819, ch. 42, § 1.]

See Q 3777. For form of plea of non estfaln-tum, sec Q 2940, N0. 1.
Plea of non as.n'gument.—By “assignment” here is meant an endorsement.

If an

endorser is sued, he likewise denies on oath the execution of the endorsement. Car.
Lawsuit, Q 251. The holder ofa note not payable to bearer cannot show a legal
title to it, unless it has been assigned to him in writing. Nelson v. Marley, 2 Yerg.
§ 576. If the defendant desires to put the assignment of a bond sued on in issue,
he must plead mm as-rignavit. Shaw v. Bowen, 1Tenn. 249. And an endorsement
need not be proven unless denied by plea. Such a plea need not be on oath as was

required by the Act of lBl9,eh. 42, a 1, where the party denying the ligrtaturais
sued; but it is a plea denying that the plaintiifhas title to the paper. Oliver v.
Bank of Tennessee, 2 Swan, 59, 60. By the law merchant as it has existed in
England for a long period, in a suit against the maker of a note, or the drawer or
acceptor of a bill of exchange by an endorsee, the endorsee was required without

any special plea from thedefendant, to prove the transfer of the note or bill; or in
other words his interest in, or title to sue thereon.

But by a practice which

seems to have obtained in this State from an early period without Legislative
sanction, but too well established to be now questioned, an endorsee in such cases
is not required to prove the transfer or endorsement of the note or bill, unless

put in issue by the plea of non assignment, as it is termed. Richardson v. Cato, 9
Humph. 464, 465-6.

This plea has been too long considered and received as

proper, and is too well established in the practice of the profession and of our
courts, to be now questioned; otherwise it might well be urged that without any
special plea from the defendant, the assignment ought to be proved, as well as
averred by the plaintiff, as a necessary ground to show his right or title to insti
stute and maintain the action in his own name. Whitesidu v. Caldwell, 9 Yerg.
§ 421,428. The plea of non assignmmt, traversing an averment in the declaration,
concludes to the country. Ib. Although in suits originating in the Circuit Court,
the assignee will not be required to prove the assignment unless the same is de
nied by plea; yet in causes originating before a Justice of the Peace, no written

pleading is required in such a case, and the defense of want ofassignment, not being
required to be sworn to, may be made orally upon the trial. In such a case, the
plaintiﬁ‘ is bound to show that the title or right to the note sued on is in him ; and

if he sues in his own name, he must prove the assignment to himself. Stone v.
Bond, 2 Heisk. 425-6; Richardson v. Cato, 9 Humph. 464. For the pleadings
before a justice are ore tenua, except when it is required that the plea shall be un
der oath. Neville v. Northcutt, 7 Cold. 294, 298. In such a case, unless the de
fendant is sued as assignor, Q 3777 has no application. Ib., 427.
_
Plea of non estfactum. A plea. by the obligors in an oﬂicial bond “ that they
did not undertake and covenant as theplaintiﬁ in his declaration hath alleged,”
is in eﬂ'ect a plea of mm est factum, and must be sworn to. State v. Thompson, 2
Heisk. 147, 151. Where the plaintiﬁ declared on a bond alleged to have been
lost, and payable in money, when in fact it was payable in cattle, the variance

should have been taken advantage of by a plea of non. eatfactum denying the ex
ecution of the bond declared on. A plea of non auiynavit, and a plea that the
bond has not been lost, admit the existence of such a bond as set out in the dec
laration. Copeland v. May, 1 Tenn. 891. The denial on oath in apetition for sup
ersedeas to quash an execution against a stayor, that the petitioner ever executed
an order authorizing the justice to enter his name as stayor, is in effect a plea of
non utfactum. McDowell v. Tnrney, 6 Snead, 225, 228 ; also cited under§ 3777.
The etfect of the statute, [Act of 1819, oh. 27, Q 4, infra, Q 3777, and the above,]
is that both the plea and the oath shall be in writing. Roberts v. State, 11

Humph. 539-40. And this easeprescribea the form of the plea as follows: “ In
courts of record, where formal pleadings are required, the defendant should aver in terms that the bond or other instrument is not his deed, and annex his
aﬂidavit to the truth of the plea. It would not be sufﬁcient to allege that he did
not sign the instrument, or authorize another to sign it for him ; for that mightbe

true, and yet the party may have delivered it as his deed. Ib., 540-41. And so
a plea of non at fadum as to an appeal bond, which merely stated that the bond
was signed in blank, ﬁlled out long subsequent to the signature, and therefore not
the defendant's deed, was held bad, because it did not aver that there was no seal
ing and delivery of the bond ; for the bond may have been made good by subse

quent delivery and acknowledgment. Stuart v. Davidson, Cooke, 202. And so a.
plea of mm rstfarhzm, alleging that the notes sued on were,when endorsed by the
defendant, blank as to the amount; and by defendant delivered to the maker, for
whose accommodation they were made, to be ﬁlled up and used for a sum not ex

ceeding $500; and that the maker afterwards, in the absence and without the
authority of the defendant, and in the presence of the plaintiffs, ﬁlled them up
in double that amount, is not good; for although the plaintiffs were present,
yet if they were ignorant of the maker’s want of authority so to ﬁll up and use

the notes, and were bo:-iajide holders, they would still be entitled to recover.
Grissom v. Fite,1 Head, 332, 885. And see Kimbro v. Lytlo, 10 Yerg. 417.
For although a party may not have signed a bond, yet if his name was put to it by
his direction, and he afterwards acknowledged it to be his act and deed; or if his
name were signed to the bond by a stranger without his authority, and heafter

wards acknowledged it to be his, or did any other act by which a recognition
of the bond might be inferred, he will be bound by it, and it will be considered
his bond. llill v.&ales, 7 Yerg. 410, 418. An account signed merely, without
any acknowledgment of its correctness, or promise to pay it, is not a bill, bond,
note or obligation for the payment of money, and need not be denied on oath to
put in issue the authority for signing. Ross v. Yeatman, 8 Swan, 144. Other
wise, swom accounts, as in Q 3780.
§ 4
Unless denied under oath, the execution or assignment of the instrument is equal

ly conclusive, whether introduced by the plaintiﬁ‘ or defdant.

§ 8779.
The only way to question the authority of an attorney to execute a bond is by
plea of non est fadum. Henshaw v. Lewis, 4 Hayw. 242.
Before a Justice of the Peace.-In a proceeding before a justice, where the plead
ings arc oral, the proceedings informal, and matter of substance only required, a
sworn plea alleging “that defendants neither assigned nor made their marks to
said note, nor did they ever authorize any other person to do so ; and that the
said note is wholly unjust and forged, ” is a good plea of non catfactum. The al
legation that the instrument was wholly unjust and forged carries with it as much
certainty as the most formal plea. This allegation could not be true, and yet the
instrument be the proper deed of the parties. Roberts v. State, 11 Humph. 589.
Note signed by aye1it.—Where the note sued on was signed by an agent, a plea '

of non a-urumpa-it, swom to, is not sutﬁcient to call in question the agency. McClain
v. Williams, 8 Yerg. 280.

Plea puts d(l7‘)‘ti?l coviinuance.—'l'lie provisions of the above section requiring
pleas since the last continuance to be sworn to, must be lived up to as strictly as
that in regard to pleas ofuon est fat-tum. If such a plea is otfered without being
sworn to, and its recqation objerted to at the time, the permitting it to be ﬁled is
error and ground of reversal. Caldwell v. Richmond, 1 Heisk. 468, 47l.—A plea
since the last continuance is not a waiver of former pleas. See Q 2892, and note.

§ 2910. All allegations in the declaration, not denied in the
Allegatlon not

denied. taken
as true.

plea, shall be taken as true for all the purposes of that issue.
It is a general rule that whatever is not denied in pleading is virtually admitted.
Cock v. Taylor, 2 Tenn. 49, 52. Thus, a demurrer to a declaration admits the
covenant sued on, so that on executing a writ of inquiry after overruling the de
murrer, [Q 2937,] it is not necessary to produce the covenant in evidence, nor to
make proofof it. Shelby v. Yancy, 1 Tenn. 236. And the plea. of payment to a
declaration in debt on a bond, admits the bond, so that it is not necessary to pro
duce it on the trial. Bailey v. Wallen, 1 Tenn; 198. And a plea of payment to a
declaration on a lost bond, admits that the bond described in the declaration once
existed. Rogers v. Kincamon, 3 Humph. 252. And a plea of payment admits the
liability as charged, unless the defendant show that he has paid the debt. Bass v.

Sharer, 2 Heisk. 216.

And so the plea that anote was given for Confederate

money, admits the making of the note. Ib.

And if to an action by an assignee on

a lost bond, the defendant plead non ¢m'gna.vit, and that the bond has not been
lost, these pleas admit the existence of the bond as stated in the declaration,

Copeland v. Hay, 1 Tenn. 891.

And so a plea of covenant performed admits the

due and proper execution of the bond which is the foundation of the action, and

imposes upon the defendant the necessity of showing aﬂirmatively the performance
of the duties arising from the covenant. Governor v. Organ, 5 Humph. 161. In
debt on s. bond, if the declaration allege the bond to be lost, and the defendant
set out the condition of the bond, and plead condition performed, it is the same
thing as if the bond were in court upon oyer, both penalty and condition being
admitted by the pleading. Cherry v. Mann, Cooke, 268, 270. And the plea. of

non aasumpait, not sworn to, admits the due execution of the note. Smith v. Mc
Manus, 7 Yerg. 477, 485; Knott v. Planter’s Bank, 2 Humph. 493. And the due
assignment of it. Smith v. Wallace, 4 Yerg. 572, 576. But the ‘plea of mm aa
signment, which differs from non estfadum by an endorser, need not be sworn to.

See note to preceding section.
In a case before the Code, it was held that a plea of non asaumpsit, not veriﬁed,
did not admit the truth of an averment intended to cure a misdescription in the
instrument sued on, and this would have to be proven ; but it admitted the instru
ment itself. Rice v. Ragland, 10 Humph. 545, 550. Now see Q 2788.
“Solemn admission of record,” operating as an estoppel. See House v. Wake
ﬁeld, 2 Cold. 325.
A plea in bar pleaded to the whole declaration, must contain a sufﬁcient answer

in law to the_ whole grauemen, or cause of action; otherwise it is ill for the whole,
and the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the whole. Reed v. Moore, Meigs, 80;
Young v. Fentress, 10 Humph. 151. Where matter pleaded as an answer to the
whole, is in law a good answer to a part only, the proper mode of excepting to
it is by demurrer. Heigs, 81 ; 10 Humph. 153. In order to constitute a suﬂi
cient answer to the whole declaration or count, thero must be coupled with it,
within the same plea or in a separate plea, a response to the residue of the count,

which it omits to answer.

§ 10 Humph. 153.

An action is not discontinued by

replying to the plea without taking judgment by default as to the part unanswered.
Ib. The plaintiff may at his election treat such plea as bad, and demur thereto ;
or he may waive the objection, and take issue thereon, and demand a judgment
by default as to so much of the cause of action as remains unanswered, to be en
tered up at any time, during the term at which the issue is tried. Ib. But upon
issue taken upon such plea, the jury cannot go beyond it, and ﬁnd in respect to
the matter not embraced in the issue; and should they do so, their verdict thus

far may be wholly disregarded; no judgment whatever can be based thereon. Ib.
Or if it contained no sufﬂcient matter in bar, it was demurrable as a plea in bar.

“ Double.”—-As to duplicity in pleading, see§ 2907, and note, and Q 2882 and
note.
A notice of special matters of defense under this section, should be as certain:
sulﬁcient, and effective as the special plea provided by the next section. West v.

Tyler, 2 Cold. 96, 101 ; approved and illustrated in Hart v. Reynolds, 1 Heisk.
§ 208, 214. No replication is necessary to the grounds of defense stated in the no
tice. 2 Cold. 101, 102. Ifthe defendant does not give notice of his special de

§ 2917. To such special plea the plaintiﬁfshall reply, and the AM

Under the preceding sections of this Article, the defendant may plead such de

fenses as he may deem necessary to the justice of his case.

He may in one plea

deny what the plaintiﬂ‘ alleges, and in another confess and avoid it; which is, in

law, an admission in one plea of what he denies in the other. But the admission
does not relieve the plaintitf from the burden of proving what is directly denied
by the other plea. Noel v. HcCrory, 7 Cold. 628, 628; citing Car. Lawsuit,§ 287.
A plea of confession and avoidance here is not an admission of the contract.
Ib. And would it not be better to plead the matter of avoidance hypothetically?

[Act 1756, ch. 4, § 7.]

D¢_ﬂmIt|'on and Itiatory.—A set-oil’ is not a cross-action, but e mere substitute
for it. Thomton v. Flint, 2 Heisk. 202-3. But it is in the nature of a cross-action.
Keith v. Smith, 1 Swan, 92, 95; Hooper v. Spi'cer, 2 Swan, 555, 558. It was un~
known to the common law. 2 Heisk. 203. A brief history of the law on this

subject, usit has come down to us, will be found in this case. 2 Heisk. 203-4.

lfy

the Act of 1855-6, ch. 71, incorporated into the Code in the following sub-sec
tions, the remedy was materially enlarged. Gatewood v. Demon, 3 Head, 380- ‘

§ 81.
“ Jlfutual demands.”-—'l'hus, njoint demand cannot be set oﬂ against a separate
one. 6 Bnc. Ab. 136; 2 Hcisk. 203. And this was held to be the law under our
early statute of 1756, ch.4, Q 7, in Blanks v. Smith, Peck, 186, and Robertson v.
Talbot, 2 Yerg. 258. And the Code has not broken down, but clearly recognizes
this distinction. Turbevillo v. Broach, 5 Cold. 270. The rule is, that joint, and
separate demands cannot be set oﬂ" against each other, and vice veraa. 5 Cold. 270 ;
Peck, 186; 2 Ycrg. 259; 2 Heisk. 202. Thus, a debt due from a partnership
ﬁrm cannot be set off at law against a debt.dne to an individual member of the
ﬁrm. 2 Hcisk. 202; Wilson v. Kecdy, 8 Gill, 197. And so in n suit against one
member ofa. ﬁrm, it is not permitted to set otf s debt due from the plaintitf to the
ﬁrm. 2 Burr, 262; recognized in 2Heisk. 205. But n mrtiving partner may set
§ 0ﬁ' partnership claims against his own individual debts. 5 Term, 493; 6 Term,
§ 582; 7 Watts,565; 2Heisk. 205. See @2011. And ajudgment recovered by a
feme sole may be set off against ajudgment obtained against her and her after
taken husband, for a devastav-it committed by her as administratrix; these debts

being mntnnl. Rutherford v. Cobb, 5 Yerg. 112.
“ At the time of action braught.”—A debt or demand to be set oﬂ‘ must have
existed at the commencement of the plaintiﬂ"s suit. Brazleton v. Brooks, 2 Head,
§ 194, 196; Jefferson Co. Bank v. Chapman, 19 Johns. 322; 2 Paige, 586 ; Miller
v.Andrcws, 2 Cold. 880, 384; Keith v. Smith, 1 Swan, 92. But if the debt be
subsisting at the commencement of the suit, but fnll due afterwards, it can be set
oﬂ‘; and it is competent to present it under the plea puis darrein continuance. 3
Cold. 384. And this is the only way it can be presented. 1 Swan, 95. And now
by Q 2912, this pies would not be a waiver of former defenses, as stated in the
casein 1 Swan. But the rule does not extend so far as to allow the defendant
to purchase claims against the plaintitt‘ after suit commenced, and plead them by
way of set-oil‘. 1 Swan, 95; 3 Cold. 384; Peck, 187. And see Wilson v. Reeves,
§ 4 Sneed, 183. But by the Act of 1859-60, ch. 27, Q 30, [snpm, Q 1829 6, sub-sec.
§ 27,] this exception does not obtain where suits are brought by assignees of banks,
unless the assignment was made before the passage of the Act. 8 Cold. 384. So,
n. judgment if obtained either by recovery or assignment, before the commence
ment of the suit, may be set oﬁ’. Wilson v. Reeves, 4 Sneed, 17 3.

Recau_pmmt.—By the common law, where the defendant has sustained
damages by reason of the plaintiﬁ‘s non-performance of his part of the agreement
sued on, the defendant may abate the plaintiﬁ"s verdict and recovery, by the
amount of such damages. Overton v. Phelan, 2 Head, 445, 447; Pettee v. Ten
nessee Manufacturing C0., 1 Sneed, 381 ; Henning v. Vanhook, 8 Hnmph. 678,
§ 681 ; Porter v. Woods, 3 Hnmph. 56; Whittaker v. Pullen, Ib., 466; Crouch v.
Miller, 5 Hnmph. 686; Deberry v. Young, 1 Thompson's Cases, 76. S0 in an ac
tion for the price of a chattel, the defendant may show in mitigation of damages,
or by way of recoupment, that the value of the chattel was less than the price by
reason of an invisible defect known, at the time of sale, to the seller, and con
cealed by him. Sample v. Sooney, 1 Tenn. 85; Hogg v. Cardwell, 4 Sneed, 151,

§ 156-8.

Or where there was a failure of title by reason of fraud in the sale.

Mc

Lean v. Houston, 2 Heisk. 87, 42. And this principle is declared as the proper
construction of sub-sections 2 and 8 of this section in the case in 2 Heisk., and
in Ford v. Thompson, 1 Head, 265. And since the Act 1855-6, ch. 71, the de

fendant may not only avail himself of these damages to abate or extinguish the
plaintiffs demand against him, but he will also be entitled to a judgment and exe
cution against the plaintitf for any amount or balance for which he may be found
liable. Overton v. Phelan, 2 Head, 455-7. See Q 2922. The principle above
stated did not, however, extend to executed contracts, as where a conveyance had
been made with warranty. In such‘case the defendant was driven to a separate
actwnon the covenant ofwarranty. Henning v. Vanhook, 8 l-Iumph. 678. And see
Mullins v. Jones, 1 Ilead. 517, 519. But in this State it extends to allowing a person
evicted from real estate, to recoup against the claim for mesne proﬁts the value or
any permanentrents and improvements he may have made. Q3261 and note. Under
this statute, the right of recoupment exists equally against the assignee of the
original party, where the demand has passed into his hands subject lo the equities

by which it was qfecledin the hands of Ute assignor. Ford v. Thompson, 1 Head,
§ 265, 267. As in case of a note assigned afterit fell duo. l Head, 265; approved
in 2 Heisk. 42; Gatewood v. Dcnton, 3 Head, 380. The party who takes a note
after it is due, holds it subject to every equitable defence that may be set up
against the payee. Under the above statute, if at the time of the assignment of
the note, the defendant had a well founded right of action against the assignor,
the right attached itself to the note at the time of the transfer, and may be pleaded
as a set-of against the assignee. 8 Head, 380. And this was the rule before the
Act of 1855-6, ch. 71, in case ofinstruments which were assignable under the Act
of 1801, [§ 1967,] but not negotiable. Moore v. Weir, 3 Sneed,46, 49. But this

principle only embraces a right of action against “ the original party,” the payee;
it does not extend to a right of action against an intermediate endorser. Hooper
v. Spicer, 2 Swan, 494. Where the plea alleges fraud in the sale of the property,
it is unnecessary to aver that it was returned, or offered to be returned. 2 Heisk.
§ 43-4; 1Head,,265; Connor v. Crunk, 2 Head, 246. Otherwise, it seems, where

the suit is for defects covenanted against in an express warranty. Bosson v. Han

Under the above two sub-sections, and Q 1804, 1806, the want or failure of
consideration may be pleaded to a sealed instrument, as it might have been pleaded to an unsealed instrument before the Code. McLean v. Houston, 2 Heislr. 41-2;
overruling the doctrine of Coleman v. Sanderlin, 6 Humph. 562. And see Mullins
v. Jones, l Head, 517.
The plaintiff does not recover on his count upon the special contract; for that
is broken. He recovers on his common counts to the extent of the beneﬁt cou
ferred. 1 Sneed, 384. The defendant may give his damages in evidence under
the general i ue. 1 Tenn. 87. But this does not seem to be well settled, and

it would be better to plead it specially, or give notice so as to avoid surprise to
the other party. 4 Sneed, 158. And so as to prevent a future recovery for

the defendant would be entitled to a. recovery against such
original party. [lbT, § 3.]
§ 29l9.- Mutual debts, though of a different nature, between
the parties to n suit, or between the testator or intestate of both
or either party, may be set oil’ against each other by being

pleaded in bar, or in discharge of the action, either wholly or
in part, as the case may be. And if either debt arose by rea
son of a penalty, the sum intended to be set oil‘ shall be pleaded
in bar, setting forth \vhat is justly due on either side.

“ Mutual debu, though of a. diferent natur-;. "—A.ll the authorities concur that

in an action brought to recover damages which are uncertain and unliquidated, and
which it is the exclusive province of a jury to estimate and assess, no set-oil‘ is
allowable. The statute does not apply except in case of mutual debts; that is to
claims in the nature of a debt reduced, or reducible to a certain speciﬁc pecuniary
amount, and recoverable in an action ez:contractu, as assumpait, (ftflf, or wvenanl.
Moore v. Weir, 3 Sneed, 46; Ragsdalc v. Buford, 8 Hayw. 192, 195 ; Edington
v. Pickle, 1 Sneed, 122; Bolinger v. Gordon, ll Humph. 61; Russell v. Smith,
l Thomp. Cas. 34. The rule stated in Martin v. McAlister, 2 Yerg. ll 1, was that
wherever debt or indebilalus aammpsit will lie, a setaolf will be allowed. Thus, n

covenant held by the plaintitffor payment of a deﬁnite sum of money discharge
able in bar iron, and a bill single held by the other party, were mutual dzbu
within the Act of i756. Moore v. \Veir, 8 Sneed, 46. And so, an obligation for

the payment of a sum certain, dischargeable in the bonds of a railroad company
by a given day, may be pleaded in set-oil‘. Memphis and Little Rock R. R Co. v.
\\'alker, 2 Ilead, 467. But the defendant cannot set up by way of set-oil‘ the
supposed value of a wagon which the plaintill‘ had agreed to deliver to him, unless
the price at which it was to be received had been agreed upon. l1 Humph. 61.
The defendant may set oifa note of the plaintiﬂ‘ transferred to him by mere de

livery before suit brought, he being the owner of the note.

Allen v. .\IcNew, R

Humph. 46, 57; Hiekerson v. McFaddin, 1 Swan, 258; McGinnis v. Allen, 2

Swan, 645, 647.

So if the note was payable to the ﬁrm of which defendant was a

member, and on dissolution the note fell to him by verbal division of the assets,

he may plead it as n set-oﬂ' in a suit against him individually. 1 Swan, 258. But
a note payable to :1 ﬁrm and assigned to the defendant by an individual member
thereof, cannot be used by him by way of set-oﬂ‘ ; for such an assignment docs
not pass the legal interest. Mclntire v. McLsurin, 2 Humph. '71.

But where the

maker of a note which had been several times endorsed when over due is sued by

an endorsee, he cannot in the absence of fraud, set oil‘ a debt due him by an in
termediate endorser, although such debt was due at the time the note was in
the hands of such intermediate cndorser. Hooper v. Spicer, 2 Swan, 294.
Against personal represmtative.—The death of a creditor has no effect whatever
upon his debtor’s right of set—oﬂ'. In a suit by his personal representative, the
defendant may set oﬂ' notes of the decedent purchased subsequent to his death,
but before the commencement of the suit. McGinnis v. Allen, 2 Swan, 645. The
fact that the estate is insolvent does not affect the right of set-off against it, if
the debt sought to be sot off was due at tho time of the decedent's death. This
rule is expressly laid down in the Act of 1852, ch. 284, I 49, [supra, Q 2896,]
which is only declaratory of the previously existing law, and the rule in case of

bankrupt estates. Richardson v. Parker, 2 Swan, 529. If the agent ol‘ an exec
utor receive money due the testator, and fail to pay it over, and is sued fortlze
same by the executor, ho may set offagainst the executor any debt which may be

due him from the executor in his individual capacity. David v. Bell, Peck, 135.
Query by Mr. Meigs: “ For this seems to compel the executor to pay his own debt‘.
with the assets, nolens volens, and so to commit an involuntary dwaslavit.” 1
Dig., Q 79, sub~sec. 7.

Statute of limitationa.—A debt barred by the statute of limitations cannot
be pleaded as a set-off. Stone v. Duncan, 1 Head, 103. For the defendant becomes
actor, and must make out. his case upon his plea as if he was suing in a cross

action. Ridley v. Buchanan, 2 Swan, 555, 559.

-

Book debt law, Q 378l.—lt was held in two cases that the defendant might

prove his set-offundcr the book debt law :—McLain v. Kincaid, 5 Yerg. 232 ; Clark
v. Howard, 10 Yerg. 250.

And this was tacitly admitted in French v. Branden,

§ 1 Head, 4'7, and probably is not now questioned. But the case in 10 Yerger, quoted
the Act of 1819, ch. 25, Q 2, by which defendants are permitted to prove their
accounts when offered as a set-off, in the same manner, and under the same

rules and regulations as the plaintiﬂh were then by law permitted to prove their
accounts. This Act seems to have been omitted from the Code.

This section simply states the doctrine laid down in Hadley v. Hickman, 1 Yerg.

set-oil‘ as any other debt; and the argument that a set-oﬂ‘ ls allowed instead of n

matured his claim, has no force. Wilson v. Reeves, 4 Sneed,173, 175. And a

Of money or

§ 2926. A plea of tender of money, or of a thing in action,
shall be accompanied by a delivery of the money or thing in
action to the clerk of the court. [Ala. Code 1852, § 2245.]
This plea is now considered a. fair and honest plea to the merits of the action,
may be pleaded after an imparlunce, and is considered an issuable plea. Free»
mun v. Napier, l Yerg. 410. The general proposition maintained in this pleais,
that the defendant has done all that was in the power of any debtor alone to do
toward the fulﬁllment of his obligation; leaving nothing to be done towards its
completion but the act of acceptance on the part of the creditor. Keys Y. Roder,
§ 1 Head, 19, 21. The plea of tender must be accompained by the payment of the
thing tendered into court. Mulherrin v. llnnuum, 2Yerg. 81; McN-uiry v. Bell,
§ 1 Yerg. 502; Keith v. Smith, 1 Swan, 92, 95; Keys v. Roder, 1 Head, 19. The

plea must allege a tender before suit was brought; or if predicated of matter arislng subsequently, it is competent to present it under a plea puis darrein continu
ance.

Miller v. Andrews, 3 Cold. 380, 384.

The tender can only be made under

a rule ofcourl, authorizing it tobe done, and upon payment of costs up to that date.
§ 1 Swan, 95. If the cause originated before a justice, the money should, in strict
ness be produced on the trial before the justice ; at least, to make the tender avail

able in the Circuit Court, the money should be olfered at the time of ﬁling the pa
pers in the Circuit Court.

§ 1 Head, 20.

If the tender was of money, it is pleaded

with an averment that the defendant was always and still is ready to pay it.

§ 1

Head, 21. This plea is nota bar of the action, but it isa bar of the lIll7!l0{/68 and
costs only. 1 Ycrg. 502; 2Y1;-rg. 81. The plea being made, the debt so tendered
will thereupon cease to form any part of the litigation in that behalf, and the other
party will be entitled to receive the money. 1 Swan, 96; 1Tidd, Pr. 620. Where
the contract stipulated payment in bank notes at par value, the plea mast allege
that the notes tendered were of par value. 1 Yerg. 502. United States Treasury
notes are legal tender. Johnson v. Ivey, 4 Cold. 608, 614. As to what is money,

sec note to Q 1943.

“ Thing in action” in the above section, seems to be another

expression for chose in action.—Ed’s.

ment for the defendant - upon the plea, vests the title to the gggeeglﬁgf for
vests title in
thing tendered in the plaintiff, subject to any claim the defend plulntlﬂ.
ant may have for his trouble in keeping it. [Ib., § 2276.]
See éﬁ 1790, 1791. On a contract for the delivery of speciﬁc articles, the plea
must aver tender or readiness on the day appointed in the contract ; that neither
the plaintiff nor any person for him, was present during the day to receive them;
and that the defendant has always been ready, and is yet ready to deliver the
same. Tiernan v. Napier, Peck, 21; S. C. 5 Yerg. 410; Miller v. .McClain, 10

Yerg. 245; Nixon v. Bullock, 9 Yerg. 414 ; Walters v. McAlister, 4 Ilayw. 2995
Nivins v. Merrick, 1 Tenn. 314. It must allege that defendant was ready on the
day, and at the place appointed by the contract, or by the notice given, when no

deﬁnite time was appointed, to the last moment or uttcrmost convenient time of
the day appointed, ready to deliver the articles. 5 Ycrg. 413-14. And where by
the terms of the contract it was necessary for the defendant to give notice to the
plaintiff of the time when he would be ready to deliver, a plea by the defendant
that he gave notice of the day, and was ready on that day to deliver, must show the

time wllcn the notice was given, and the interval between it and the day appointed
for delivery, and that the intermediate time was snﬂicient for the plaintiff to pre
pare for going to the place appointed, prepared to receive them and convey them

away.

§ 5 Yerg. 415.

It is no substitute for this plea to say that he had been

garnishecd as debtor of the holder of the covenant; that he had appeared before
the tribunal to which he was summoned, and declared that there was in his pos
session two thousand pounds of iron, which he then had ready to pay and dis
charge the covenant; and that said iron was condemned in his hands as the prop
erty of said holder, and levied and sold to satisfy an execution against him. For
here are not averments necessary to make a good plea of tender. Miller v. Mc

Clain, 10 Yerg. 245.
§ 2928. When the plea contains new matter by way of avoid

ance or set-oil", the plaintiff shall reply thereto by demurrer or
otherwise, and like proceedings may, if necessary, be con
tinued by way of rejoinder or further pleadings until issue is

joined.
Any pleading properly tendering an issue forms one without a similitcr. Smith
v. Eubnnks, 9 Yerg. 20, 23. A rejoinder “in short," as the word “ rejoinder " is
good if treated so by the parties, in a case where a rejoinder properly drawn out

and concluding to the country would have tendered an issue. Ib. See “ Pleadings
in short," under Q 2906.
Matters not

§ 2929. Matters not denied in each subsequent pleading

[Iowa Code 1860, § 2917.]
.
See Q 2910, and note.

Thus, agmeral replication to a plea justifying an assault

on the ground that defendant was n public oﬂicer, puts in issue the fact of his being
such oﬁcer, and no more. If he had intended to rely on the fact that the chas
tisement was excessive, he should have put that in issue by a special replication,
in the nature ofa new assignment. Tomlinson v. Darnell, 2 Head, 588.

an answer to the plea. [Ib., § 2250.]
§ 2932. By leave of the court, for causes shown, the defend
ant may ﬁle more than one replication. [Ib., § 2251.]
A replication may state several distinct facts, where they do not constitute sepa
rate answers to the pleas, but taken in the aggregate tend to an answer ; and this
is not duplicity. And if it state any fact which does not tend to such an answer, it
may be disregarded. Pilcher v. Hart, 1 Humph. 524, 536; citing 1 Chit. P. 501-2,
§ 556-7.
The Act oi‘ 1794, ch. 1, Q2, [Q 2907,] which allowed the defendant to plead as
many several matters as were necessary for his defense, did not apply to replica
tions; but under our practice the plea of set-oﬂ‘ was treated as an exception to the

general rule; so that he plead by way of a replication to such a plea as many several matters as were necessary for his defense. Ridley v. Buchanan, 2 Swan,

[Ib., § 2252.] p
§ 2934. Demurrers for formal defects are abolished, and those Hemmer
only for substantial defects are allowed. All dcmurrers shall
state the objection relied on. [Act 1851-2, ch. 152, modiﬁed.]
This section makes all demurrers special. Fowler v. Alexander, 1 Heisk. 425-6;
Brooks v. Smith, 1 Thomp. Cas. 226, 233. And now a general demurrer can have
no other eﬁect than to stand as a motion to dismiss. 1 Thomp. Cas. 233. Under
this section, a demurrer “in short, ” as the word “ demurrer,” although followed
by the word “joinder, " signed by the opposite counsel, is a nullity; because it
speciﬁes no cause of demurrer. Johnson v. 0’Neal, 8 Head, 601. See “Plead
ings in short,” under Q 2806. The provisions of this section apply to all courts,
chaneery as well as law. A general demurrer in chancery should be overruled
and treated as a nullity. A demurrer to the jurisdiction of the chancery court
[M-1318, 4319, 4321] must be special and state the objection relied on. Kirkman

v. Snodgrass, 8 Head, 370.

For a form of demurrer, and entries of the various

proceedings thereon, see Gar. Lawsuit, Q

§ 3 Crunch. 229. And see Ward v. Moore,

§ 6 Yerg. 491 ; Shelton v. Bruce, 9 Ycrg. 24, 26. This general rule applies also in
criminal procedure. Lewis v. State, 1 Head, 329, 331. Thus, under the defend
ant's demurrer to the Attomey General’s replication to his plea in abatement, it
was held that the plea itself was bad. 1 Head, 881. And where the plahltiﬁ‘ de
murred to a plea of the defendant, this reached a fatal defect in his own declara
tion, for which judgment was reversed on error, and his suit dismissed. 9 Yerg.

§ 26. And the dcfendant’s demurrer to the plaintiﬂ‘s replication “ hit his own plea, " ~
in 6 Yerg. 492. The demurrer of necessity covers all defects for which the plead
ings will on motion be taken from the ﬁle; as where the plaintiff declared in trover
in the statutory action of replevin, the defendant ﬁnding the property. Nashville
Ins. 8: Trust Co. v. Alexander, 10 Humph. 878, 381-2. See note to Form 9, §
§ 2939; Q B383. It is a good cause of special demurrer that the damages in an ac
tion of covenant are left blank in the declaration. Robertson v. Waters 1 Yerz.
But under the Act of 1809, ch. 49, Q 21, [Q 2863,] the party may amend on

application. Ib. But in asmmpsil, damages laid in the writ, but left blank in the
declaration, are aided by verdict. Groves v. Dodson, 8 Yerg. 161. If a demurrer
is ﬁled, and the action of the court not demanded thereon, it will be presumed in
the Supreme Court, that it was admitted to be suﬂicient, unless it appear by bill
of exceptions, or otherwise, that issues on the pleadings demurred to had been
passed on by the jury, in which case it will be presumed that the plea was waived.
Johnson V. O'Neal, 3 Head, 601. Contra, Mosley v. Matthews, Meigs, 678. In

an old case it was held that if a defect, as damages left blank in the declaration,
be pointed out by special demurrer, and the plaintiff falls to amend, he proceeds

at his peril; and he will not be allowed to amend in the Supreme Court, but judg
ment will ; he reversed, and entered for the defendant. Robertson v. Watem, 1
Yerg. 200. But now see Q 2872, and note.
Amendment

§ 2935. Either before or after judgment ‘on demurrer, the

[Ala. Code, 1852, § 225-1.]
For the form of judgment on sustaining demurrer to declaration, see Car. Law
suit, Q 194. Where it is sought to amend, the amended pleading should be drawn
out in form and offered to the court, so that the court can see whether it presents
a good defense to the action. Rainey v. Sanders, 4 Humph. 447; Dockery v. Mil

plaintiff must aver in the declaration demand of payment of the maker, and notice
of dishonor to the endorser, or assign some legal excuse for failing to make de

statement of a valid title, wh_ich will be aided by verdict; but it is matter of sub
stance upon which the right of recovery depends, and which, if not averred is not

cured by verdict or judgment by default.

L. M., Attorney for Plaintiﬂ'.
This form is criticized in Oar. Lawsuit, § 116, as follows: "It would seem in all
reason to he necessary for the plaintilf to show in his declaration that the right
to the instrument sued on is in him. This can only he done by showing that it
was originally made to him, or to somebody else, from whom it lawfully came to
him; and; in the latter case, he ought to show how it did come from the payee to
him, as by delivery, where the note was payable to A. B. or bearer, or by endorse
ment, where it was payable simply to A. B. or to A. B. or order. A note payable

to the order of A. B. is in law a note payable to A. B. or order. [St0ry, Prom.
Notes, 36.] But the form of declaration given in the Code omits this important
requisite. It does not state to whom the note was made payable. And as those
forms are made good by express enactment, the omission would not be ground of
demurrer."

The corresponding form in the Alabama Code of 1852 is even more elliptical
omitting the words, “here to the court shown"; nor does there seem to be in
that Code any provision, as in ours—Q 2898—requiriug profert of the instrument

sued on.

Brown v. Parks, 8 Humph. 294; Reed v. Wheeler, 2 Yerg. 60. And see Roper v.
Stone, Cookp, 497; Deberry v. Adams, 9 Yerg. 52. The failure to aver considera

tion is a fatal defect which may be taken advantage of by demurrer, motion in ar
rest of judgment or writ of error. 9 Yerg. 26; 2 Yerg. 56-7. But a defective
statement of consideration, which would be bad on demurrer, may be cured by

verdict, so that it cannot be taken advantage of in arrest of judgment.
§ 297; Anderson v. Read, 2 Tenn. 205, 207.

§ 8 Humph.

Thus where the declaration averred

that the “defendant acknowledged to be due to the plaintiff on settlement
$44093, in good ginned cotton, and then and there delivered said writing,” this
is a good consideration defectively stated, such as is cured by verdict, and not fa-‘I
tal iu arrest of judgment. 8 Humph. 297. In pleading, where it is necessary to
aver a consideration, it will not do to rely on the via i¢r1n\'ni of the word “ agree-l
meat," although this word may involve a consideration. 9 Yerg. 54. A plea that.
sets up a new agreement by way of avoidance, must show the consideration.’
Thus, where a surety pleads that by a verbal agreement the creditor gave the prin
cipal debtor time without the surety‘s consent, he must show what was the consid

eration of the agreement. 9 Yerg. 52. Since the Codo, I 1804, the want, or failure
of consideration may be pleadedto a sealel instrument. McLean v. Houston, 2
Heisk. 37, 41-2. See Q 2918, sub~sec 3, and note.

during the detention, viz.: from the
day of
§ 18 ,
to the
day of
§ 18 .
L. M., Attorney for the Plaintiff.
See note to Form 18, infra. See Q 2900. It will be observed that the speciﬁc
amount of damages claimed is not set out in the above form; nor does it aver
speciﬁcally, that the defendant wrongfully detained the goods. The conclusion,
“ form the
day of
, to the
day of
§ 18 ,” would in
dicate that the action of replevin only was contemplated in drafting this form : that

is, from the date of the commencement of the unlawful detention, until the date
when taken into the custody of the sherill‘, as provided in Q 3382. If the oﬁicer
cannot get possession of the goods, the plaintiﬂ' may elect to declare in case or de

tinue, § 3883 ; and then his declaration would allege that the defendant still de
tains the goods. See Car. Lawsuit, Q} 147-152, where the above form is comment
ed on, and a dilferent form for replevin, and a form for detinue are given.

The

Act of1845-6, ch. 66, Q 12, which is modiﬁed in 1} 8888, infra, provided thntif
the oﬂicer failed to get possession of the property, the defendant might declare
in I1-over or delinue. This did not authorize him so to declare in a case where the

ofﬁcer got possession of the property; and such a declaration might be reached
by demurrer, or stricken from the ﬁles on motion.

Alexander, 10 Humph. 378, 381-2.

Nashville Ins. &. Trust Co. v.

By analogy, the plaintiﬂ‘ could not now, un

der 2 3383, in case the oiﬁcer gets possession of the property, declare in case or
detimu. We have no adjudication relating to the substance of the declaration
under our statutory action of replevin; but it would seem that the declaration
should describe the property with the some “ reasonable certainty,” as in the alli
davit and writ, [H 3376, sub-sec 1, 8379;] that is, where several separate and dis

tinct articles are replevied, they should be separately stated with the sepamte or
der of each ; for the jury are required to assess separately the value of each arti

cle.

damages for the breach of a covenant (or agreement

as the case may be) entered into by him on the
day
§ 18 , and here to the court shown, by which he
agreed—(herc set out the contract or agreement, and the

breach complained of.)

L. M., Attorney for the Plaintiff.

If a demand is necccssary to entitle the plaintiff to his
action, it must be averred.
It is suiiicient to lay the breaches in the negative terms of the covenant; and
this rule applies to suits by distributees upon the bonds of administrators, as well
as to other cases. 3 Yerg. 468. And to suits on the bonds of guardians. The
Justices v. Willis, 3 Yerg. 461. In the action of covenant the plaintilfis restrict
ed to the speciﬁc breaches assigned in the declaration.

He cannot recover dam

ages for failure to perform speciﬁc acts under a general averment that the de
fendant failed to perform the covenant. The breach of the agreement being es
sential to the cause of action, must in all cases be stated in the declaration; and
the omission of a breach will not be aided by verdict, though the insufficiency of
the breach in general will be. The assignment of the breach must be governed
by the nature of the stipulation in the contract. Although in general it may be
assigned in the words of the contract, either aﬁirmatively or negatively, it must
not be too general, but must state with reasonable certainty and precision the
subject matter of the complaint. The general averment that “the defendant did
not perform the said agreement” is insufficient. Eastman v. Crowdcr, 10
Humph. 194; where the reason of the rule is also stated and illustrated. And
notwithstanding a judgment by default, the plaintiff is entitled to no greater lati
tude on inquiry of damages, either in respect to the admission of evidence, or the
extent of his right of recovery, than he would have been upon the trial of an
issue joined on a plea of perfonnanco. Ib.
See also note to Form 12, infra.
“ Demand.”—Where the declaration omits to aver the perfonnance of some act
on the part of the plaintiff necessary to his right to sue, such as a request or no
tice to do the act by the defendant, for the performance of which the suit is
brought; but the defendant, instead of demurring, states in his plea that he of
fered to do the act, this will cure the omission in the declaration. For if the
defendant olfcred to do the act, then he either had the notice required, or waived
it. Harmon v. Crook, 2 Yorg. 127, 13345. If the notice and request are not
averred in the declaration, the plaintiff should not join issue on a plea denying
these facts, but should demur; for such a plea is bad, not being an answer to
the declaration. But the court will look back to the declaration, and~if the omis
sion is material, will give judgment against the plaintiﬁ‘. Ib. In an action on I
covenant for the conveyance of land, it is not necessary that a request to the cov
enantor to make the deed should be laid in the declaration. Ib. And where the
covenant is in the alternative that tho covenantor will convey to the covensntee

two tracts of land, if he likes them; otherwise, one tract in lieu thereol',—the
covenant in such a case is not broken until the covenantee makes his election

which land he will have, and gives notice to the covenantor of his choice; and
this must be laid in the declaration.

The omission of this allegation may, how

ever, be cured by the plea of the covenantor that he offered to make the conveyance.
Ib.

Where a sum of money by the terms of a written promise is simply due on

demand, the bringing of a suit is held to be a sullicient demand. But where the
promise to pay on demand is held to depend upon sorneother fact than that of the
debt being due, as where the issuer of change tickets promises to pay each note
when the amount of ﬁve dollars may bepresented, then a special demand, or pre
sentation of the amount speciﬁed for payment is necessary. Kincannon v. Kidd, 4
Humph. 88- But a suit on bank notes is premature if brought before demand M the counter of the bank where payable. Union Bank v. Warren, 4 Sneed, 583;

to perform his part of the covenant is suiiicient without pointing out the mode of
performance. 3 Yerg. 465. The plaintiﬁ must aver either his performance of the
condition, or his oifer or readiness to perform it, which the defendant rejected. 2

tion of said bond has been broken by the defendant in this:
(here state concisely and distinctly the breach or breaches
complained of, ﬁrst, second, etc.,) whereby the plaintiff has

been damaged as above.
L. M., Attorney for the Plaintiff
The ancient practice was to declare upon the penalty without noticing the con
dition, and assign as a breach the non-payment of the money. This made it nec
essary for the defendant by oyer to set out the bond and condition, and plead
generally that the plaintiff had not been damuiﬁed, and this plea then concluded

with a veriﬁcation.

The plaintiff then ﬁled his replication showing how he was

damniiicd; and this being new matter, also concluded with a veriﬁcation. The
rejoinder denied the declaration and concluded to the country. The modern and

better practice is to set forth the condition of the bond and assign the breach in
the declaration, to which the plea in substance is, that the plaintiff has not been

damniﬁed in manner and form as alleged, concluding to the country.

§ 2. Wlwre U16 words are actionable per se.—-Where the slanderous charge or im
putation can be collected from the words themselves, it is not necessary to make
any averment as to the circumstances to whose supposed existence the words re
fer. Magee v. Stark, 1 Humph. 606, 512; Bell v. Farnsworth, 11 Humph. 608,
§ 610. Jones v. Marrs, 11 Humph. 214.

Slanderous words are to be understood in their obvious sense; and if, when so
understood, they necssarily convey to the mind of the bearer the imputation of a

crime, they are actionable per as ; otherwise they are not. Ib. Where the charge
is general, as “ he swore a lie," it is not necessary to aver expressly that the tee
timony was material to the issue. Cannon v. Phillips, 2 Sneed, 185, 188. In such
case, it will be presumed that it was material, and the onus is upon the defendant
to show the contrary. Ib. But where the charge relates to a pariicularfact 1,119

rant, you swore a lie and perjured yourself, and I can provo it," etc., do not need
any extrinsic averments to make them actionable. Bell v. Farn.sworth,11Humph.
§ 608.
§ 3. Where thewords are not actionable per se.—If the words charged are not in
themselves actionable, then the declaration must set forth a colloquium, whereby
to give them application in reference to some matter concerning which it
would be slanderous to speak them. Stanley v. Brit, Mart. v. Yerg. 222. Thus,
where the words were that the plaintiﬂ‘ had “ sworn lies,” the declaration should
aver that the plaintiff had a lawful oath administered to him, and that he there
upon gave testimony, of which the defendant spoke when he uttered the words.
Ib. If the words charged have no ﬁxed or intrinsic meaning imputing crime, the
declaration must show by the colloquium, or otherwise, that they imputed crime asused by the defendant. Thus, in the charge, “he altered the ear mark of my
hog,” the word “altered” has no such ﬁxed and intrinsic meaning, and the pur
pose to impute crime by it must be averred. Williams v. Karnes, 4 Humph. 9.
And the extrinsic circumstances thus set forth must be distinctly averred. Jones
v. Marrs; 11 Humph. 214; Cannon v. Phillips, 2 Sneed, 185, 189. Thus, to
charge that the plaintiff had committed perjury would be actionable in itself, be
cause the charge implies the existence of every fact necessary to complete that
crime; but the charge that he “ swore a lie,” does not imply that he has commit
ted any offense known to the criminal Code, unless that it is shown that such
charge had reference to a false oath ; willfully taken in a regular proceeding be
fore some judicial tribunal, or functionary of the law, having competent power
and authority to administer a lawful oath,—and all this must be directly averred
in the declaration. 11 Humph. 215-16. For example, an averment by way of
colloquium, that in a certain suitor action by warrant of tho State against cer

tain negro slaves, (naming them,) tried before two Justices of the Peace, (naming
thern,) the defendant was examined on oath, and gave his evidence,—is substan
tially bad, not cured by the statute of jeofaila of 1852, nor by verdict. 2 Sneed,

§ 189-91.

A colloquium which states that “ the discourse of the defendant was

had concerning a trial between the plaintiff and defendant before M. Douglass, a
Justice of the Peace, and concerning an oath the plaintiff took on said trial, before
said Justice of the Peace, in proving an account, as he lawfully might do,” sulﬁ
ciently shows the existence of a suit before a competent judicial tribunal, and
that the oath taken was as to a material matter in issue. Sharp v. Wilhitc; 2

Humph. 434, 437-8. It is not indispensible that the colloquium should precede
the statement of the words. Mart. 82 Yerg. 222.
§ 4. 1l{alici0usl_|/spo/c€rl.—The declaration should allege that the words com
plained of were spoken bgthe defendant. Pursell v. Archer, Peck, 317. And that
they were false, or falsely spoken, or maliciously spoken. Ib. But if it is averred
_that they were falsely spoken, this will perhaps imply that they were maliciously

spoken. Ib.

If the words spoken were in substance, though not precisely the

same as laid, they will be sufficient to support the declaration ; thus where the
averment is “you forged" and the proof is “he forged.” Ib.
§ 5. Plea ofjust|_Iﬁca,t1'.on.—Tliis plea must charge the crime imputed with the

same certainty as an indictment. Nall v. Hall, Peck, 325; Cannon v. Phillips, 2

by date, amount, and when and to whom ayable,) which he
hereby offers to set off against the plainti s demand, (and he

claims judgment for the residue, as the case may be.)
A plea that “plaintiﬂ was, at the commencement of the action, and still is,
indebted to the defendant for a much larger sum of money, due by note, than
the amount due from the defendant to the plaintiﬂ, and that said sum of money
so duo and owing by plaintitf, to wit, the sum of $1200, is still due and unpaid,”
is not good, because there is no statement of the note, its terms or time of pay

ment. It amounts to little more than a plea “in short,” and might have been
treated as a nullity. It does not even show, what is necessary in a plea of set-oﬂ';
that the debt proposed to be set-oil‘, was due at the commencement of the suit.

Upon terms.

§ 2942. The court, in granting continuances, may impose
terms upon the party at whose instance the cause has been
continued, by making him pay costs or otherwise, as may best
further the progress of the cause and the ends of justice. ‘
[Modiﬁed from Act 1779, ch. 4, § 5.]
See § 4245. The original Act, of which the above is a modiﬁcation provided
that all costs should be paid by the party bcforecontinuance granted. This Act

was construed in Colville v. McKinney, 1 Ycrg. 448.

Now see Q 8197, and note.

Discretionary/.—The granting or refusing of continuances both in civil and
criminal cases, rests in the sound discretion of the Circuit Court-a. discretion which
the Supreme Court will not readily revise. Todd v. Wiley, 3 Humph. 5'76; Mc
Farlane v. Moore, 2 Tenn. 32; Pitts v. Gilliam, 1 Head, 549, 558 ; Sevier v. State,

§ 1 Thomp. Cas. 192; Rhea v. State, 10 Yerg. 258; Goodman v. State, Meigs, 195,
§ 197; Nelson v. State, 2 Swan, 482. And the action of the inferior court on this
subject will not be disturbed, unless it clearly appear that there has been a wry

great abuse of this discretion.

§ 1 Head, 553.

It is not error to refuse a continu

ance on an aiﬁdavit stating the absence of witnesses summoned to prove the pen
dency of a former suityfor the same cause, the plaintiff releasing that suit of rec
ord. Turner v. Lurnbrick, Meigs, 7,‘ 12. At the ﬁrst trial term, the continuance
may be on a general afﬁdavit without stating what the party's witnesses will
swear; but if the application be at a subsequent term, although the ﬁrst continu
ance, the aﬁidavit must be special. 2 Swan, 482; 1 Thomp. Gas. 193; State v.

Morris, 1 Tenn., 220. Where a party has had two continuances, if a mistrial in tervene, this does not merge the former continuances, but his application for an
other continuance is treated as an application for a third continuance. State v.
Austin, 1 Tenn. 186.

In aumniarg/proceedings, the same rules govern as in other cases. Kennedy v.
Smith, 7 Yerg. 472. In such a case, where the party is entitled to a jury, if the
jury has been discharged and a jury of talamm cannot be summoned, there must
be a continuance. Miller v. Moore, 2 Humph. 421.

Affect of conh'nuance.—After acontiuuance has been entered, no rule or or
der can be had in the cause at that term of court. Hurst v. Selvidge, 1 Thomp.
Cas. 17; Lambden v. Sharp, Ib., 18 ; Crouch v. Mullinix, 1 Heisk, 478, 481.

§ 2943. If a continuance is granted on payment ofcosts, the Judgment
court shall enter judgment, and award execution for such costs. “mom

Williams v. Adkins, 6 Cold. 615, 617. Payment of costs is not a condition pre
cedent, unless the entry state that the rule is granted on pa}/men! of costs, or in
other express terms. ‘Sturtevant v. Fairman, 4 Sand. 674; Coming v. Corning,

trial~(l0cket in the order in which they become ready for trial,
giving the cause ﬁrst ready for trial, either by due course of
law or consent of parties, priority of position on the docket.
The term at which the declaration is ﬁled is the appearance term, and the next
term js the trial term. Elliot v. Solzkotter, 4 Sneed, 581; Lucas v. Sevier, 1
Tenn. 19; Carter v. Turner, 1 Head, 620, 522. If the pleadings are made up at
the return term, no trial can be had without the consent of the defendant until
the next succeeding term. lb. The rule of practice is, that the parties are en
titled to the delay of a term to prepare for trial. Ib. McKinley v. Beasley, 5 Sneed,
§ 170, 171-2. But see Hall v. Mount, 3 Cold. 73; § 8945 and, note. And seeﬁ
§ 8945 a, as to judgments by default to special terms. Hence, if at the request of
the plaintiff the pleadings are not made up until the return term, the defendant
cannot be forced to trial, until the next succeeding term after that; and to compel
him, under such circumstances, to go to trial at the term at which the pleadings are
made up, is reversible error. 1 Sneed, 581. And if a special lorm in appointed
between the appearance term and the trinl term, it is reversible error to force the
defendant to trial at such special term, without his consent. 5 Sneed. 170. There
fore where the pleadings were withdrawn upon an agreement to make up another
issue before the next term, so that the cause might be tried; yet if the replication

be not ﬁled until the commencement of the term, the cause is not regularly for trial.
§ 1 Tenn. 19. But if the defendant at the previous term obtained a mouth in which
to plead, and pleaded issuably, he must go to trial at the present term, although the
plaintiﬁ‘ did not join issue upon his plea, until the present term. Lytle v. Hays, 1

A judgment by default admits

Hence on inquiry of damages, evidence tending to show

that there was no cause of action is inadmissible. Union Bank v. Hicks, 4
Humph. 827. Its effect is the same as a pro cemfesso in equity, which admits the
material allegations in the hill. Warren v. Kennedy, 1 Heisk. 437, 439, and cita
tions-, infra, 4371, and note. It admits every fact well pleaded. Hall v. Mount, 8
Cold. 78, 75. Thus, in trespass for taking property, a judgment by default admits
that the defendant took the property stated in the declaration, and on inquiry of
damages, the plaintiﬂ’ need only prove its value, and he is entitled to a verdict for
the value. 1 Heisk. 439-40. A judgment by default is an admission of some
damages. Johnson v. Balfour, 1 Tenn. 18; Turner v. Garter, I Head, 520, 525.

And if upon writ of inquiry,it appear that the defendant has no legal claim to dam
nges,the jury will give only nominal damages. 1 Tenn. 18; 1 Head, 525. The

quantum of damages remains open to be ascertained by proof; and upon I/rtl

question bolls parties have an equal right to be heard.

The defendant is no fur

ther cornpromitted by judgment by default, than to preclude him from denying

the plaintiffs right to nominal damages; but subject to this qualiﬁcation, he has
the right to show, if in his power, that the plaintiff has no legal claim to damages;

and if successful in this attempt, the plaintiff isentitledto nothing more than mere
ly nominal damages. 1 Head, 525. This case is critlcizedin 1 Heisk. 442, sndis
held not to be in conﬂict with Union Bunk v. Hicks, above cited. The English prac

tice on this subject is stated in l Heisk. 440-442.

As the judgment by default is

an adnris.-rion of every fuct well pleaded in the declaration, it is proper to read the
declaration to thojury on executing the writ of inquiry. 3 Cold. 75.
Ilnnl or In
terlocutory.

§ 2952. In such case, the judgment is ﬁnal if the amount of
the plaiutiﬂ"s claim can be ascertained by simple calculation
from the papers; (a) when the amount cannot be thus readily
ascertained, the damages will be assessed by a. jury empanelled
at the same term for the purpose. (b) [Ib., modiﬁed]
(a) The term “ papers ” here refers to the writing or other evidence upon which
the action is founded, and not to the pleadings in the cause. Masonic Educational
Association v. Cook, 3 Head, 318-14 ; Williams v. Inmun, 5 Cold. 267, 269. That
is, upon the note and protest. Williams v. Bank of Tennessee, 1 Cold. 43, 45-6.

The provision was intended to apply to suits instituted upon bonds, bills of ex
change, promissory notes, liquidatcd and signed accounts, and the like, from
which the amount due the plaintiff could be readily ascertained by simple calcu
lation. In all other cases-as where the declaration counts for work and labor
done, goods sold and delivered, etc.,—the intervention of a jury is necewiry to
ascertain the sum due the plnintiﬂ. 8 Head, 814. And whether the paper sued

on is one from which the plaintiffs claim can be ascertained by simple calculation,
turns on the question of interest.

If it be one Which, under § 1945, bears in

terest as a matter of positive law, the court may without a jury, render judgment
ﬁnal. In all other cases, (since it is discretionary with the jury under proper in.

structions of the court to allow interest or not,) the intervention of a jury is nec
essary.

§ 5 Cold. 269-70.

(b) See note to preceding section; Q} 2954, 4244. Under the old practice,
Act 1794, ch. 1, Q 26, the writ of inquiry was to be executed at the term succeed
ing that at which judgment by default was taken, although the default was not
taken at the appearance term. Perry v. Stark, 10 Humph. 57¢. Unless the
cause stood on n rule to plead and try at the ﬁrst term, in which case, when the
cause was reached in course, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment ‘by default,
with inquiry of damages instanter. The rule of practice stated in Robertson v.
Cannon, 1 Tenn. 262, is believed to be obsolete. See note to Q 4239. Now, if
the writ of inquiry is ordered for the next term, it may be executed at n special
term. Hall v. Mount, 3 Cold. 78. But see McKinley v. Beasley, 6 Sneed. 170;
Q 3945 and note. In case of a suit against several joint defendants, where one
alone pleads, it is error to proceed to judgment against him, and leave the case

in statu quo as to the others.

Either there should be a. nolle;rro.!equi as to those

who do not plead, [2 4246,] and trial as to the one who does, or judgment by de
fault may be taken as to those who do not plead, and the same jury which tries

§ 421, 423. See Q 2959.
Conduct of the trial.—Rules as to the order and conduct of trials may be ir.~
ﬂexibly adhered to, or relaxed, according to the discretion of the presiding Judge,
and the circumstances of each case, so as to attain and not defeat the cnd of their
adoption. Thus, the plaintiff having stated that the evidence was closed, and the
defendant that none would be introduced on his side, it was not error to refuse the
plaintiff leave to examine a. witness, summoned by, and attending on behalf of the
defendant, however material his testimony. Cozart v. Lisle, Meigs, 65. It is a
very ancient and important rule of practice, that the plaiutilf shall, in the opening
of the case, examine all the testimony that goes to establish the action; the de

fendant shall then introduce his proof upon his matter of defence, and his testi
mony rebutting the proof introduced by the pla.intiﬁ'; and the plsintilf may intro

duce any which may rebut that of the defendant, but nothing in chief, unless by
permission of the court, which permission ought not to be given except for good
and suflicient reason shown, lest the good which results from the rule be destroy
ed, and the evil intended to be obviated, visited upon the courtin full force. The
relaxing of the rule, then, is s matter of discretion with the court; and so diili
cult it is to reverse for the exercise of a discretion, that many of the courts have
refused to do so; but in this State it has been held, that the wrong exercise of

a legal discretion is matter of error; but then it must be gross and palpable, and.
not subject to hesitation or doubt. In this case one of plaintiffs witnesses having
been impeached, the plaintiti‘ undertook to introduce another witness in chief to prove the same facts, after the close of the defendant's testimony. This was re
fused, and the judgment afﬁrmed. Smith v. Britton, 4 Humph. 201 ; quoted and
approved in Cash v. State, 11 Humph. 111, 114. So it was not error to exclude a
deposition offered by the defendant as evidence in chief, after the plaintiff‘ had
closed his rebutting testimony. Story v. Sanders, 8 Humph. 663, 667. On the
other hand, after the testimony had closed, and the argument commenced, it was
not an erroneous exercise of this discretion, for the court to suggest to the Attor~
ney General that he had not proved the venue, and to permit him to do so. 10

' Humph. 114-15.

Nor was it error where a party elected to go to trial without a

witness, and the witness arrived during the argument, for the court to refuse to
henr his testimony. Wattersouv. Watterson, 2Head, 1, 8. It was not error to
permit a subpoena with the return thereon to be read to the jury; for this, though

a waste of time, proved nothing affecting the issue, and could not by any possi
bility have inﬂuenced the verdict. Miller v. Koger, 9 Humph. 281, 235. Nor
was it error to refuse to allow the bill of exceptions to be read to the jury, in a
cause which had been to the Supreme Court. Massengill v. Boyles, 11 Humph.
§ 112. It is not error to refuse to permit an intoxicated witness to give evidence.
Kincaid v. Meadows, 3 Head, 188, 193. It is error to refuse, in civil cases, to

place witnesses under the rule, where it is asked upon aﬂidavit of its necessity.
Rainwater v. Elmore, 1 Heisk. 363; Dougherty v. Shown, 1 Heisk. 802. Wit
nesses who have not been put under the rule may be called to impeach the cred
it ol‘ those who were. Woods v. McPhcran, Peck, 871. If the court adjourn in
course, while a jury are deliberating, this worksa dissolution of the jury, and they
may disperse without any order discharging them. Berry v. Wallen, 1 Tenn.

§ 2957. On the trial of any suit, civil or criminal, in the
Circuit Court, the Judge shall deliver a written charge to the
jury, if the attorney for either party desire it, and present to

him, on the opening of the cause, a brief statement in writing

Jhnrpze to
he jury.

of the points on which he expects to rely; and the Judge’s
charge shall embrace his opinion upon the several points con
tained in the statement; and it shall be ﬁled with the papers
and constitute a part of the record. [Act 1835, ch. 8, § 1.]
§ 2958. Should other points besides those contained in the
attorney’s statement arise in the progress of the cause, the
Judge, on being requested in writing to do so, shall deliver a

written charge thereon. And he shall embrace in his charge
all other points upon which he may doom it essential to charge
the jury, though the same be not embraced in the statements

of the attorneys.

[Ib.]

See Const. of Teun., Art. 6,Q 9, and note. It is the province of the court to
slate the evidence, and of thcjury to weigh it. Marr v. Marr, 5 Sneed, 385. To
chnrgzc in substance that :1 particular fact would be “a strong eirmmsfance, if
not conclusive," or “ un almost irresistible circumstance," is a clear invasion of the

province of the jury. Ib.

And where the Judge said, “ you would not be warrant

ed on this testimony in ﬁnding a verdict,” etc.; or where after reciting certain
points in the evidence, he said, “ consequently there could be no recovery." Case
v. Williams, 2 Cold. 239. And so where the Judge said “ that the proof showed
that the defendant in good faith intended to deliver the cotton, but did not do'
liver it in fact.” Fitzpatrick v.Fain, 8 Cold. 15,18. As to the manner of charging
in mixed questions of law and fact, see Whirley v. Whiteman, 1 Head, 610, 616
The jury should be properly instructed on questions of law, and placed under no
improper inﬂuence, or in any way misguided in coming to correct conclusions.
Hence it was reversible error for the Judge to tell the jury that the Supreme Court
could correct any error they might commit, and to threaten to keep them conﬁned
after the court was over. Taylor v. Jones, 2 Head, 565. Where, in addition to
laying down the general rule governing the case, it is deemed proper by the court
to give speciﬁc instructions with reference to tho facts of the particular case, such
instructions should apply to the material facts on both sides of the case. James v.

Drake, 3 Sneed, 340.

A party has the right to the opinion of the court distinctly

upon the law, where he has given evidence tending to prove the issue which he
has submitted to the jury. Williams v. Norwood, 2 Yerg. 329. But the court is
not required, nor is it good practice, to give opinions upon abstract propositions
submitted during the trials. Ford v. Ford, ll Humph. 89, 92. Where there is op

posing evidence on the issue, and the court charges that a certain state of facts
raises a presumption of the issue being one way or the other, he must qualify the
charge as to the presumption being prime facie or conclusive. Rutland v. Gleaves,
§ 1 Swan, 198. There is no rulc of law by which the Judge is required in his charge,

to settle questions of science, so as to put him in error for failing to do so.
But if there were such a rule, the party complaining could not have the advantage
ofthe objection, unless he had requested a charge on the particular point. Sewanee

Mining Co. v. Best, 3 1Icn.d, 701, 704.

For the Judge to repeat several times, on

the return of the jury into court, to report that they cannotlagree, disjointed parts
of his charge, is error. Swaggcrty v. Caton, 1 Hcisk. 199, 202.

§ 2959. Upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, the 'g';!::,glf_:»ct
decision, if requested by either party, shall be given in writing,

stating the facts found and the conclusions thereon, which shall
constitute a part of the record.
§ 2960. Jury causes always have precedence in the disposition -5:3 §=r\;lc¢eI_
of the business of the court, if the regular panel is in attendance ; “°“°°'
but actions at law submitted to the court upon issues of fact,

Kendrick v. Stewart, 1 Tenn. 476.

“ As to any one or more."-The terms nomuit and nolte prosequi have
long been confounded in Tennessee. Since the Act of 1801, the motion to take
a nonsuit, when made by a plaintiff, is equivalent, to the motion to enter a nolle

proaequi.

Wherever at common law, the plaintiff could enter a nolle prosegui,

he may, by our practice, enter a nonsuit.

Partlow v. Elliott, Meigs, 547.

It

was held in the following cases, Young v. Stringer, 5 Hayw. 30; Greer v. Miller,
§ 2 Tenn. 187 ; Tipton v. Harris, Peck, 414, 422, and Hutchins v. Sims, 7 Humph.

§ 236, that where an action is commenced against several joint defendants, it can
not bc dropped as to some and proceeded in as to the others. Either there must
be a dismissal as to those not proceeded against, or judgment by default may be
taken against them; in which case the writ of inquiry must be executed by the
snme jury which tries the issues as to those who plead. 7 Humph. 287. Judge
Cooper, in his note to the case in Peck, doubts the principle of these cases, and
cites the Code, IQ 2789, 2790, which see. And see, Paton v. Trigg, 4 Hnyw.
§ 250, and Claiborne v. Goodloe, Cooke, 891, 894; and notice the language,

“failure to recover as to one," in 2790, supra. And where in an action agiiipst
two, the death of one is suggested in the court below, and without any proof of
the same, judgment is taken against the other, this on error brought, will be

taken as an informal nolle prosequi, and no reversal will be had for such action.
Miles v. Kroger, 9 Humph. 231.
Setting aside nom-uit.—'I‘his should not be done except on ailidavit showing

cause.

A bare suggestion by the party is not suiﬁcient.

It cannot be done by

the consent of the parties without the assent oi‘ the court. McPherson v. Hynds, 1
Tenn. 197. It is not error to refuse to set aside a nonsuit, Union Bank v. Carr,

illuinph. 345; Trice v. Smith, 6 Yerg. 819. But though a cause has been
several years in court, if it has been continued generally or by consent, a non
suit will be set aside where the atﬁdavit shows that exertions were made to pro
cure certain papers, without which the cause could not be prepared for trial, and
they were procured too late to make the necessary preparation. Sharpless v.
Sevier, 1 Tenn. 117; McAlister v. Williams, Ib., 119. It will require a much
stronger ground to grant a new trial than to set aside a nonsuit. 1 Tenn. 119.
A nonsuit discharges the witnesses in the cause. Cochran v. Brown, 1 Humph.
§ 329.

(b) But as the right of set-off is incidental to and dependent upon the fact of
the plaintiﬁ‘s establishing a right of recovery against the defendant, if the jury

ﬁnd ayaiitst Ute plainttf in respect of his demand, there can be no judgnent for
the defendant on his plea of setotf. East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad Co. v.
Galbraith, 1 Heisk. 482; Bi-azletou v. Nashville 8: Chattanooga R. R. Go. 3 Head,

becomes a part of the record of the cause.
A bill of exceptions which is not signed cannot be treated as a part of the rec»
ord, though the record recite that it was signed, scaled, and made a part of the

record. Garrett v. Rogers, 1 Heisk. 301. On the other hand, it is not necessary
that the minutes of the court show that the bill of exceptions was signed, sealed,
and made a part of the record, although that is the‘ usual formula. If the bill it-‘
sell" show that fact, it is sullieient. Grubbs v. Grier, 5 Cold. 160. A bill of ex
ceptions not made and signed at the term when the cause is tried, is a nullity.
Girdner v. Stephens, 1 Heisk. 280, 290', McG:ivock v. Puryenr, 1 Cold, 34; Clark
v. Lary, 8 Sneed, 77; Staggs v. State, 3 Hnmph. 872, 874. A hill of exceptions
is for matter excepted to, and ascertained before the verdict. It is not requisite

that it be formally signed before the trial is at an end.

It is suﬂicient if the ex

ception be taken at the trial, and noted by the court, and it may during the term
be reduced to writing, and signed by the Judge. Ferrell v. Alder, 2 Swan. 77, 79 ;

citing Walton v. U. States, 9 Wheat. 657, and E2: parts Bradstreet, 4 Pet. 106.
The dictum in the case in 2 Swan, that the Judge may in a special case, make an

express order, allowing further time, to prepare it, [after adjourment in oourse,]
is overruled in all our subsequent cases. It cannot even be done by an “ express
Order ” of court and consent of parties.

§ 3 Sneed, 7 S-9.

And Where the bill

omitted to state that it contained all the evidence, an entry of a subsequent term,
showing that fact, was held to be unauthorized. Davis v. Jones, 8 Head, 603,
§ 605. The principle is, that after a cause has been transferred from one court to
another, whether by appeal or change of venue, the court from which it was trans
ferred has lost all jurisdiction over it, and cannot proceed further in it. 8 Head,
§ 604. See 1 2843, and note. But courts have power to correct mistakes in their

records at a subsequent term. See Q} 2877, 2878, and notes.
The Circuit Judge is not bound to sign a bill of exceptions which does not set
out the facts and the whole charge of the court. In many cases such parts of
the proof only need be set out as to raise the question to which the charge applies,

if such part of the charge be-diconnected from the other parts.

But where the

whole charge is connected, so that to fairly understand any part, the whole must
be taken together, the entire charge should be stated. If the charge cannot be un
derstood without stating the whole of the evidence. then it should beset out. As
to these matters the Judge trying the cause is the proper judge, and his discretion
must be ezclzwive. Mc(.‘allen v. Sterling, 5 Yerg. 223. It is his duty to insert in
the bill of exceptions the testimony as he understands it; and it was no error for
him to refuse to postpone a motion for new trial till a witness could be had, about
whose testimony the adverse-counsel differed so much that they could not agree how
to insert it in the bill of exception. Miller v. Koger, 9 Humph. 2&1, 235. If the
Circuit Judge refuse to sign a bill of exceptions, or insistupon signing an imperfect
one, this cannot be reached on error in theappcllate court. 5 Yerg. 224 ; 9 Humph.
§ 236. The only redress is by mandamus in a case properly made out. 9 Humph.
§ 236. And this writthe Supreme Court will issue, in aid of its appellatejurisdiction.
Sneed v. Hall, 3 Cold. 255. As to the qﬂicc ofa bill of exceptions, howfar it is a
record, and what it must show, see Heiskcll’s Digest, QQ 274, 275, 278; also the fol

to good count.

[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 63.]
This statute is noticed in Pursell v. Archer, Peck, 317, and Anderson v. Read,

§ 2 Tenn. 205.

In the former case it is said that the plaintiff may, if he choose,

obtain the direction of the Judge to the jury, not to regard the faulty count ; and
if he does not, it is his own fault. It cannot appear in any case but that the Judge
was applied to, and did so charge the jury; and whether this was done or not, it
cannot afterwards be objected to, that some of the counts are bad ones, and that
damages were assessed upon all. Peck, 818-19.

Aide?" by verdici.—-'I'he distinction between defects which are fatal after verdict,
and those which are not, arises from an entire mnission of a statement of facts,
which are the gist of the action in the one case, and an imperfect statement in the
other; or as some of the cases express it, a want of title lorecouer in the one
case, and a dqfrclive aiainnmi of title in the other. See Anderson v. Read, 2
Tenn. 205, 207; Rodgers v. Love, l Humph. 417, 420; Woodson v. Moody, 4

see Q 2864, et seq. The reason of the distinction above stated is, that wher'e there
is no averment of title to recover, no proof is necessary, and none is supposed to
have been made ; but where there is an imperfect averment, the law presumes, after

verdict, that the necessary evidence was made. 2 Tenn. 208; 6 Yerg. 514; Mart.

Verdict without in-ue.—A verdict without an issue to try is a nullity. Hayﬁeld
v. Beech, 2 Suced, 443; Trabue v. Higdeu, 4 Cold. 620, 625. Mosley v. Matthews,
Meigs, 578. As whore there was no declaration, and the only plea in the cause, a.
plea in abatement, was quashed after jury sworn. 2 Suced, 443. Or where there
was no replication to a plea in abatement. 4 Cold. 625. Or where issue was not
joined on a replication de injuria. Meigs, 579-80. But in one case where the ree
ord showed service of process, ﬁling of declaration, jury sworn to try the “ issues
joined," both parties being present, and no plea was found in the record, the
absence of a plea was held matter of form, for which the Supreme Court would

not, since the Act of 1852, ch. 152, reverse. Cornelius v. Merritt, 2 Head, 97.
See Q 4242, where the parties in certain cases may appear and contest without is

sues.
A verdict must respond to all the issues joined. Anderson v. Anderson, 4 Hayw.
§ 255; Robertson v. Netherton, 2 Tenn. 326; Boon v. Planter's Bank, 3 Humph.
§ 84; Crutcher v. Williams, 4 Humph. 345 ; Kirkpatrick v. R. R. Bank, 6 Humph.

rey v. Brown, 3 Sneed, 17; overruling Theaveuought v. Hardeman, 4 Yerg. 565.
But objections of tlliS kind are not to be encouraged, as they may be, and most
often are the result of clerical mistake. Thus, where in assumpsil against a com
mon carrier, there were three pleas to the single count in the declaration, namely,
not guilty, non aarumpait, and a special plea of performance, and the jury found
the “issue ” in favor of the plaintiff, the Supreme Court held in support of the
verdict, that the pleas made but one general issue, and did not amount to dis
tinct and separate defenses, and that the word issue covered the wholo. Carter v.
Graves, 9 Yerg. 4-46, 452-3. And now see Q 2873. A technical response is un
ncccss-.ir_v. If its sense and legal effect make a response to the pleadings, the
court will sustain it, and pronounce judgment upon it. 3 Humph. 84; approved in
§ 3 Sneed, 19 ; 9 Humph. 220. There need not be a distinct ﬁnding on each issue;
if the jury “ find the issues joined ” for the plaintiff or defendant, it is suilicient.

§ 3 Snced, 19.

Thus, in aasumpsit, where the pleas were non-assumpsil, payment,

and accord and saliafadion, and the verdict was that the defendant did not im
dertalrs and promise, in manner and form as plaintiﬂ‘ in declaring had alleged;

this was held suﬂicient to support the judgment; “for there was no reason, in
view of the state of the pleading and the legal effect of the verdict, to infer or to
apprehend that the jury may not have considered and passed upon all the evidence
applicable to the defenses set up in the plea; and where there is no such reason,
policy and duty obviously require that we should sustain verdicts, and the judg.rnents rendered upon them.” 7 Humph. 22. So, “ we ﬁnd that thedefendant owes
the debt, ” would negative nil debit and payment. 6 Humph. 46. And where
there were two pleas, payment and seboff, and the jury found “ the issue in favor of
the plaintiﬁ§ " this was held good; for the word “ issue" is often used as a nomen

oolleclivunt, and the phrase “ issue joined ” may embrace various distinct grounds
of defense. Pointer v. 'I’lanter’§ Bank, 7 Humph. 532. And ﬁnding “the issue
for the defendant” upon :1 plea of covenants performed,is good. Blair v. Billings
ly, Peck, 85, 88.

But in Young v. Porter, 5 Yerg. 98, it was said that the ver

dict, “ do ﬁnd for the plaintiﬁ, ” would be no suﬂicient response to the issues, if
one could be found in the record; but as the parties had chosen to go to trial on
a mere shadow, the court would sustain the verdict; for where the premises were
so uncertain, it could not ndduce other conclusions. The formula, “do ﬁnd for
the plaintiﬂ‘," is the one used in proceedings commencing before justices, where
there are no pleadings. Ib. Upon the rule of the foregoing cases, that the ver
dict must be responsive to all the issues, see Judge Cooper's note, 4 Hayw. 255,
(Cooper’s Edition.) So much of the verdict as is responsive to the issues may be

received, and the rest rejected as surplusage, and the verdict thus moulded into
legal form. Kennel v. Muncey, Peck, 278. Judgment upon verdict of eleven ju
rors is voidable, and will be reversed on error. McDonald v. McDonald, 5 Yerg.

But now a defective verdict must be objected to before judgment entered.

Cold. 488-90. And it is held that in

Britton, 2 Heisk. 606; Rice v. Kirkrnan, 8 Hiimph. M5. Nor can judgment be
rendered against the sureties where the principal is dead. Houston v. Dongherty,
§ 4 Humpl1._505. But the reason for so holding is that summary proceedings, be

ing lll derogation, of the common law, must be construed strictly—a rule of con
struction which of late years is being much questioned. See Judge Cooper’s note,
Peck, 424, 425, (Cooper's Edition.) - It was, however, held in an oral opinion at

Knoxville in 1860, that in a motion against a sheriifancl his “ securities,” the fact
that in the motion the name of one of the sureties in the bond had been omitted
by mistake, would not vitiate the judgment. Jones, Gov. v. Henderson, 1 Thomp.

Cas; 53. See Summary Proceedings, infra. Q 3583, at seq.
Judgments must be certa2'n.—lI‘hey must express with certainty and precision the
determination of the court. - Ajudgment that the plaintiff recover of the defend~
ant, “ according to the provisions of the Act of Assembly in such case made and
provided," is reversible for uncertainty. Harman v. Childrcss, 3 Yerg. 327. And
so a judgment condemning land for non-payment of taxes, which recites the var
ious items in columns, nnder_siich abbreviated headings as “ Coll.,” “ Pri." etc., is
void for uncertainty. Randolph v. Metcalf, 6 Cold. 400, 407. Where some of
the defendants plead and other_s do not, and aiverdict is rendered against all, the

‘judgment can only extend tidithoseiwho made the issue.

Barrett v. Hambright,

_4 Sneed, 580, 538; Boyd v. Tit2er', 6 Cold. 568, 570. But though such a judgment
is irregular, it is void only as to those who do'not plead, and they alone can com
plain of it. 6 Cold. _570. In such acnse, the proper practice is, to take judgment
by defanlt,a.s to those who do not plead, and the writ of inquiry is executed by the

samejury which tries the issues.

Hutchins v. Sims, 7 Humph. 236.

And see Q

§ 2951, note; Q 2952, note (b), and § 296,4, note. And where several are sued, and
one -of them is not served, and does not appear, and judgment is entered against
-‘ the defendants," without naming them, it is held toembrace those only who were
served, or who appeared. Winchester v. Beardin, 10 Humph. 247, 251 ; Boyd v.
Baynham, 5 Humph. 886. Nor does a judgment so entered embrace a defendant

not served, and as to whom a nolle prosequi was entered, although his name
was inserted with those of the other defendants in the margin of the entry. 6
Humph. 886. Nor is the omission of the name of one of the defendants in the
margin of the entry a matter of any consequence. Ajudgment is, in legaljeifect,
valid against all who are regular defendants to, the suit; and who are such, is a
matter to be ascertained by the process, pleadings and proceedings in the suit.
Wilson v. Nance, 11 Humph. 189-l9'l. i But in Boyken v. State, 3 Yerg. 426, it
was held that a judgment must be suiilciently certain to enable the clerk to issue
execution by an inspection ofrit, wiihoht aeferencc to other entries. [And whether i
or not a judgment would_now be reversed bgacanse not entered with this degree

of certainty, yet clerks should adhere inﬂeiiibly to this rule in all cases, if for no
other reason than their own convenience, _-and to ,av0i‘d the uncertainty which
might arise, in issuing execution in case of a subsequent loss of the papers in the
casc.—Eds.]
Thejudgment of theconrt ought always to be the conclusion of the law upon
the fads of the case, either admitted by the particstor found by-the proper tribu
nal. _If several material issues of fact are found, and they are all submitted to
the jury, and only‘ oneiof thcm is embraced ln the verdict, no judgment can be
pronounced upon it, for the judgmentjs not the conclusion of the law upon one of
the material facts disputed by the parties,-but upon all. Robertson v. Netherton, 2
Tenn. 326. But errors in the verdict, must now be objected to before entering the

judgment. Sec Q 2873.

And the judgment must conform lo the verdict.

If the

jury omit to ﬁnd the facts necessary to found the judgment upon, the court can
not, in order to be able to pronounce judgment, ascertain the omitted facts from
some other source than the verdict. Thus, if the jury ﬁnd that there isa balance
of the debt remaining unpaid, but do not say how much thatbalance is, the court
cannot give judgment on that verdict for any particular balance. Patterson v.

Damages as

herewrore.

§ 2975. Whel1€\'Cl‘ damages are recoverable, the plaintilf
may claim and recover, if he show himself entitled thereto, any
rate of damages which he might have heretofore recovered in

any form of action for the same cause.
On bonds with
conditions.

§ 2976. In actions brought on bonds or agreements for the

payment of money, or with collateral conditions, and recovery
had by the plaintiff, the judgment shall be entered for the
stipulated penalty, to be discharged by the payment of the
principal and interest due thereon, or the damages assessed by
the jury, and execution shall issue accordingly.
[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 66.]
Originally if suit were brought at law on a penal bond, recovery was had for
the penalty, which constrained the obligee to ﬁle his bill for relief. The statute
of 8 and 9 Wm. III, provided a remedy at law; but as this statute was not in
force in this country, a like remedy was atforded by our statute 1801, ch. 6. This
statute affords a plain and unembarassod remedy at law, and transfers to the
courts oflaw the subject of penal bonds, which was orignally ofequitable cogni
zance. This subject has become so purely a subject of legal cognizance, that

equity will not interfere unless it be made to appear that such obstructions as the
plaintiﬁ‘ could not control, intervened at law. Williams v. Patterson, 2 Tenn.
§ 229. And sec Turney v. Young, 2 Tenn. 265. Upon breach of a contract evi
denced by a penal bond, the amount in justice and equity, which ought to be re
covered, is such a sum in damages, as will compensate for the injury sustained in

not performing the condition of the bond, and no more.

§ 2 Tenn. 230.

The judgment is for the penalty to be discharged by the damages. Haslet v. Pryor, 3
Hayw. 33, 35. The above act applies to cases where the damages assessed are
less than the penalty of the bond. The case of damages beyond the penalty
seems not to be embraced in the act, but left as before to the common law, name
ly, that the penalty cannot be exceeded. Therefore, if the jury return a verdict
for damages in excess of the penalty, the judgment thereupon rendered can only

be for the amount of the penalty.

Overall v. Babson, 2 Yerg. 71.

For, to give

judgment beyond the penalty would be to violate the plain and simple meaning of
the obligation. Cherry v. Mann, Cooke, ‘Z68, 271. Nor can judgment be given
for interest in excess of the penalty. Ib. 272. Unless, perhaps, in cases where,
by express agreement of the parties, the penal part of the bond is to become a
rcaldcbt, in which case that sum with interest may be recovered. Ib. But costs
areto be allowed in addition to the penalty. 6 Hayw. 85; Cooke, 2'73.
§ 2977. Any person indebted to another in any way, may go, By confession.
with the evidence of the debt or a statement of the cause of
indebtedness in writing, before any Justice of the Peace, or
into any court having jurisdiction of the amount, and confess
judgment in favor of the creditor for the amount then due.

[Act 1829, eh. 50, §§ 1, 2.]
§ 2978. So, also, if the debtor at the time the debt was con-on written
tracted, or afterwards, authorize any person in writing to whom"
confess judgment in any court of record, or before any Justice
of the Peace, for the amount of such debt, the person author
ized may, after the debt becomes due, go before any Justice of
the Peace, or into any court havingi jurisdiction of the amount,
and confess judgment in favor of the creditor for the amount
then due. [Act 1801, ch. 19,§ 1.]

§ 2979. The written evidence of the debt shall be ﬁled and ,‘,\;§;§@{j¢,;I
constitute a part of the record of the cause, and no appeal or '“°“'
writ of error shall be granted from such judgment; and no com.
more costs shall be taxed than the clerk’s fee for entering the
§ 2980. Judgments and decrees obtained in any court of
record of this State in the county where the debtor resides at
the time of rendition, shall be a lien upon the debtor’s land
from the time the same were rendered.

Lien on land

[Act 1s31, ch. 90, § 7.]
Lien ofjudgment.-The history of the lien of judgments is shown in 2 Meigs’
Digest, Q 1163. Our cases on this subject and the lien of executions are full of

extra-judicial dicta, often crude and contradictory, and calculated to confuse and
embarrass the searcher who takes up the subject for the ﬁrst time. Conﬁning the
search to the points in judgment, it has been held, and is the settled law in this
State :—
§ 1. As betwren creditors, that is, as between judgments rendered on different
days of the same term, the lien of the judgment takes effect by relation from the

ﬁrst day of the term, and the creditors share ratably in the moneys collected.
Porter v. Earthman, 4 Yerg. 358; approved in Berry v. Clements, 9 Humph. 312,
§ 325.

§ 2. But as between the creditor and a purchaser or a stranger, the lien at
taches only from the actual date of the rendition of the judgment, as shown by
the rcocrd. Murfrce v. Carmack, 4 Yerg. 270. And see Berry v. Clements, 9
Humph. 312. And it is even said that the day may be divided, and the parties
may be permitted to show, where the rendition of the judgment and the registra
tion of the deed took place on the same day, which had actual priority in point of
time. 4 Humph. 296. But in Berry v. Clements, 9 Humph. 312, 324-5, the
court say they do not think it competent to show by parol evidence the precise
hour of the day in which the judgment was rendered. In such cases, unless there

is something in the record to show at what hour the court met, the judgment
would be held to relate to the ﬁrst instant of the day. Cox v. Hodges, 1 Swan,
§ 871. But if the record shows at what hour the court met, it would relate to that
hour. 9 Humph. 325. The conveyee in a deed of trust is a purchaser within
the meaning of this rule. Berry v. Clements, ut supra. Where the judgment and
conveyance [or now noting for registration, § 2073,] are on the same day, and

there is nothing to show that the judgment had actual priority, the deed will pre
vail. 4 Yerg. 296.

§ 8. In case ofpartne1~ship.—Where one has a judgment against a member of a
partnership ﬁrm, and another has ajudgment against the partnership, both judg
ments constitute alien upon the separate estate of each partner. Reid v. House,
§ 2 Humph. 576, 583.

§ 4. After-acquired land.v.—The lien extends to such lands acquired by the de
fendant after the rendition of the judgment, as may be levied upon and sold with
in the time limited by the statute. Grccnwny v. Cannon, 3 Humph. 177, 179 ; ap.
proved in Davis v. Benton, 2Snecd, 665, 668. The lien also attaches to the land

acquired by the debtor after the expiration of twelve months; and it continues for
the period of one year from the time it attaches, within which period it may be
made eifectunl by a levy and sale of such ai‘ter-acquired lands, and such levy and
sale will overreach and avoid all intermediate alienations. 2 Sneed, 665, 669;
Chapron v. Cassaday, 3 Humph. 661.
If at the time of the levy, the defendant have no interest in the land, subject to
execution at law, but acquire the legal title before the sale, the lien of the judg~
meut at once fastens upon the land, and operates to pass a valid title to the pur
chaser. Greenway v. Cannon, 1 Humph. 177; contra, Pratt v. Phillips, lSnced,
§ 548, 547, without assigning any reason for so holding.
§ 5. Not ezniended during the war.--The lien of judgments was not embraced in
the Amendments of 1865, to the Constitution of the State, Q 4, Schedule.
Brawncr v. Nance, 3 Cold. 299. Nor was it extended by the war. Smart v. Ma
Bon, 2 Heisk. 223.

§ 6. Agreement to stay e:cecution.—The lien of a. judgment is not lost by an
agreement to stay execution for a speciﬁed time. Love v. Harper, 4 Humph. 113;
overruling on this point Porter v. Cooke, Peck, 30, 36.
§ 7. Eject of an injwteiio_norsupersedea.s.—If the lien has been ﬁxed by actual

levy, an injunction suspends, but. does not destroy it. Miller v. Estill, 8 Yerg.
§ 452, 460; Overton v. Perkins, Mart. 81. Yerg. 367, 373. This rule was qualiﬁed
in Conway v. Jett, 3 Yerg. 481, 484, by holding that such would be the rule, ex
cept where an injunction bond was given; but the case in Martin 8: Yerger, is to

the contrary. Now bond is required in all cases. Q 4439. So in case the judg
ment is stayed by a writ of error comm mbis and superaedeas, the plaintiff does
not lose his lien. The Legislature intended that a party who might be prevented
by process of law from eifectuating his lien, by a sale of land within a year, should

have a year in which to sell, after the obstruction to his execution should he re
moved. P|anter’s Bank v. Union Bank, 8 Humph. 804. The rule is dilferent as
to the lien of executions on personalty. See below. But if there has been no

levy, the lien expires within the year, notwithstanding the injunction, and a pur
chaser after that time, takes a title superior to the lien of the judgment, although
he may have had notice of its existence.
which does not seem to be to the point.

§ 8 Yerg. 459 ; citing Mart. 8: Ycrg. B72,
Sec Q 2983.

The lien of an execution upon the personal goods oi‘ the defendant is from its
teste. This doctrine is either declared or recognized in the following cases: Pres
ton v. Surguoine, Peck, 71, 80; Johnson v. Ball, 1 Yerg. 291; Givin v. Lati
mer, 4 Yerg. 22, 28; Porter v. Earthman, 4 Yerg. 358, 368; Battle v. Bering,
§ 7 Yerg. 529, 531 ; Dally v. Perry, 9 Yerg. 448 ; Black v. P1anter’s Bank, 4 Humph.
§ 367; Neil v. Gaut, 1 Cold. 396-7; Peck v. Robinson, 8 Head, 438; Parrish v.
Saunders, 1 Humph. 481 ; Union Bank v. McClung, 9 Humph. 91 ; Barnes v.
Hays, 1 Swan, 304; Evans v. Barnes, 2 Swan, 292; McMahon v. Glssscock, 5
Yerg. 304 ; Malone v. Abbott, 3 Humph. 532; Coffee v. Wray, 8 Yerg. 464, 466;
Erwin v. Dundus, 4 How. 58; Kane v. Love, 4 Cranch, O. C. 429. To this rule
there is one exception. As against a bomz ﬁde purchaser, the lien does not re-.
late to a period anterior to the award of the execution—that is, anterior to the
date of the actual rendition of the judgment. This was adjudged in Berry v.
Clements, 9 Humph. 312, the only case in which the question has distinctlyarisen.
It results from the foregoing principlos—

§ 1. That if the debtor dies after the rendition of the judgment, and before the
issuance of the execution, the execution runs against his goods as though his
death had not happened; for it is tested of a period anterior to his death, binds
the goods from that time, and places thcm in euatodia legis. Peck, 80; Darby
v. Russell, 5 Hayw. 189, 147-8; Black v. Planter-‘s Bank, 4 Humph. 367; Erwin
v. Dundas, 4 How. 58; Kane v. Love, 4 Cranch, C. C. 429.

§ 2. That if the plaintzgf die subsequent to the judgment but before the issu
ance of the execution, and the teste of the writ is anterior to his death, the writ
will not be quashed because of his death, but will be executed, and his personal
representative shall have the money; or if there be no personal representative. it

Iiill be deposited in court until the appointment of one.

Neil v. Gaut, 1 Cold.

$96.

§ 8. That if the judgment is rendered before the death of the debtor, but the
teste of the execution is subsequent to his death, the execution is void, and a sale

underit communicates no title. 4 Yerg. 28; 5Ycrg. 304 ; Mitchell v. St M-nxent,
§ 4 Wall. 237.
§ 4. That in a contest between execution from diﬂ'erent courts, the one having
the oldest teste is entitled to priority.

§ 1 Yerg. 291; 9 Yerg. 442; 8 Yerg. 466;

§ 9 Humph. 326.
a. But if the contest is between an execution from a court of record and one is

sued by a Justice of the Peace, priority of levy prevails. Q 3078, and note.
b. Between executions from Federal and State Courts, see note to { 8001.
Ii. That in a contest between an execution and an attachment, if the teste of
the execution is anterior to the lev_v of the attachment, the execution holds the
property. 3 Head, 488.
§ 6. That an alias execution is a lien upon the personalty of the debtor from the
day of its teste until the day of its return, and does not bind the goods from the

date of the award of execution. Hence, in a contest between an alias, and an
originalexecution, the one with the earliest teste prevails. 9 Humph. 91 ; 8 Yerg.
§ 464.

a. But if the original were levied upon the defendant’s personnlty, the fact that
there was an alias issued, and that it was re-levied, and that a sale was made

Federal Gourl.s.—Tho above provision applies to the Federal courts, as well as

§ 81 TENN. STAT.
§ 2986. And, in both cases, the lien shall cease, unlessa
bill in equity to subject said interest is ﬁled within thirty days
from the return of the execution unsatisﬁed. [Ib.]
The case of l\Ic'.\"uiry v.Eastland, 10Yerg. 310, arose in 1832, and before the
above statute ; or at least, states the general doctrine of liens of judgments and

executions upon equitable estates as it stood before the above statute.
Under this statute, it is hcld—'
§ 1. That no lien exists upon equitable estates unless the provisions of the act
are complied with. Chapron v. Cassaday, 3 Humph. 661, 664 ; Brawner v. Nance,

s Cold. 299, 301-2.
§ 2. The statute does not operate against the debtor or volunteers under him ; but
as against a junior judgment, properly registered and proceeded on as the statute
directs, ora purchaser for value without regard to notice, a judgment creditor who
has not complied with the requirements of the statute, has lost his priority of sat
isfaction. 8 Humph. 664.
§ 3. In case the provisions of the statute are complied with, the lien attaches to
after-acquired equitable estates, under the same rule of construction which has been

ndoptcd with reference to the lien upon legal estates, [supra, note to Q 2980.]
S Humph. 664.
§ 2987. It shall not be necessary to issue a scire facias to re
vive judgments or decrees which have lain a year and a day
without the issuance of an execution, but execution may be
sued out, in such case, after the year and day, as if issued with
in that time.
For the old law, sec Hess v. Sims, 1 Yerg. 148; Cabiness v. Garrett, 1 Yerg.
§ 491; Keith v. Metcalf, 2 Swan, '74; Gregory v. Chadwell, 8 Cold. 890-91-2. Af
ter tho lapse of ten years, under the old law, the presumption that it had been sat
isﬁed, bccame so fortiﬁed by lapse of time, that scirefacias to revive it, could only
issue on order oi‘ the court, made on motion and supported by aﬂidavit that the

judgment remained in full force and unsatisﬁed.

The presumption being thus re

pelled, the sci. fa. issued as a matter of right. But after the lapse of twenty years,
the defendant must have notice of the motion and aﬂidavit ; and thereon the

court might exorcise its discretion, and allow or refuse the motion as should seem
proper in the case. If the acirefacias issued more than ten years after the ren
dition of the judgment it sought to revive, it was necessary that it recite that an or

der of court was made allowing it to issue, or it was bad on demurrer. Where the plaintiﬁ and defendant were both dead, and the judgment had lain more than
ten years, the proper practice was for the personal representative of the plaintiﬂ'

to appear in court, and make suggestion, supported by proof, of the death of the
original parties, and suggest the names of the personal representatives, and there
upon move the court that seirefacias issue to revive the judgment and have execu
tion thereof. 2 Swan, 75.

The plaintiff may now have his execution [without

reviving,] at any time, perhaps, within ten years after the rendition of the judg
ment. 3 Cold. 392; Q 3776. If the plaintiﬂ‘ die after judgment and before execu
tion, it seems to be necessary to revive, by scirefaciaa. Ib. But if issued before his
death, it may be levied and the property sold, as though the death had not oc
curred; or though it be tested before his death, though issued afterwards, the
some result follows. Ib. See note to Q 2980. In Allen v. McCulloch, 2 Heisk. 174,
—a chancery suit-—n revivor was made in future, before the qualiﬁcation of the
personal representative, in the name of such person as should be qualiﬁed, from
and after the ﬁling of the letters. In the same case it is held that a consent or
der reviving s decree, precludes a defense against it, accruing after the decree,
and before the consent order. 2 Heisk. 192.

§ 2988. If there are more defendants than one, and any OfDcstl1of
defendant.
them die, leaving the co-defendant or co-defendants surviving,
the plaintiff may proceed by execution against the survivor,
or revive by scire facias against any portion or all of the per
sonal rcpresentatives of the deceased, to be issued to any county
in the State.
Before the Code it seems to have been settled that a scirs facias founded upon
njndgrnent rendered against two could not be takenput against one of the two,
§ 3 Cold. 393; citing Chaﬂin v. Williams, 4 Humph. 231, which see. The Code
Q 2787, and the above section seem to have changed the practice in this particu
lar. 3 Cold. 393. These two sections taken together, authorize a revivor of n
judgment against one of several joint defendants, by the representative of a de
ceased plaintiﬂi 3 Cold. 894. If the principal debtor be dead, the oiﬁcer may
levy upon the property of the stayor, without waiting for a rovivor of the judg
ment. Cheatham v. Brien, 3 Head, 552; Cabiness v. Garrett, 1 Yerg. 491.

§ 2989. The provisions of the last two sections shall apply

to Justices’ judgments, as well as to judgments of courts of me“
l record.
See Scire Facias, infra, § 8576, ei seq.
§ 2990. In all cases where execution from a court of record
udsiiiiﬁliigiw or Justice of the Peace is returned satisﬁed, in whole or in
part, by the sale of property, real or personal, taken as the

property of the defendant, and, afterwards, the property or its
value, or any part of it, is recovered by some third person by

suit against the plaintiff, or the otlicer making the levy or sale,
the plaintiff may have the satisfaction set aside, and the judg
ment or decree revived by scire facias.

[Act 1847-8, ch. 191, §1.]
Prior to this statute, the plaintitf, in the case embraced by the statute, had no
remedy at law, and it was doubted whether he had any in eqiiity. Henry v. Keys,
§ 5 Sneed, 488. But in Crawford v. Roberts, unreported, 1858, relief was granted
in equity. Ib. The original Act read “ property,” without other qualiﬁcation. This
was held to embrace real, as well as personal property. Edde v. Cowan, 1 Sneed,
§ 290; 6 Sneed, 488. The language of the Code, “property, real or personal," is
in aﬂirmance of this construction.
See Swaggerty v. Smith, 1 Heisk. 403, 406.
In the ease in 1 Sneed, the plaintitf was the purchaser of real estate, and failed to
recover of the tenant in possession, because the title was not in the execution
debtor at the time of the sale. He was granted relief under the Act. In the case
in 5 Qneed, the complainant was the purchaser of realty, but it does not appear
whether he had suffered an eviction, or failed to recover. Swaggerty v. Smith, 1
Heisk. 403, reviews the case in 1 Sneed, and decides that the failure of title ac~

quired by the purchase by the plaintiff, must be judicially ascertained in a suit
brought for that purpose, before he is entitled to relief under the statute. Unless

such a proceeding has been had, the court cannot determine under the scire fa
cias, the question whether there has been a failure of title. Ib.

As to the effect of bond of indemnity, see 1 8032, and note.

§ 2994. Whenever a judgment by motion, or action at law is

had against a sheriff, coroner or constable, and his official sure~
ties, for a failure of duty in and about an execution, and the
amount of such judgment has been paid by the sureties, the
sureties are entitled, at their cost and risk, to issue an execu

tion for their beneﬁt on the original judgment about which
the recovery was had.

The doctrine of the right of a party who has been compelled to pay the debt of un
Other to be subrogated to the rights of the original creditor, is expounded in
Smith v. Alexander, 4 Sneed, 482. And see Morgan v. Lane, 1 Heisk. 80 ; Kinsey
v. McDearmon, 5 Cold. 892; and the cases in the digests under the head of Cum
cur, Substitution.
If an oﬂficer pays oif an execution to the judgment creditor, without an assign
ment or purchase of the judgment, it is an absolute discharge of the execution,
and the oﬂicer cannot hold the execution, as unsatisﬁed, and enforce it for his
own beneﬁt. Harwell v. Worsham, 2 Humph. 524; Lintz v. Thompson, 1 Head,
§ 456. The doctrine of Smith v. Alexander, 4 Sneed, 482, is said to be not in con
ﬂict with this principle. For before the debt passes by implied transfer or assign
ment to the oﬂicer or agent, so that he can enforce it against the original debtor,
two things are indispensably necessary: 1. Thatthe liability of the oﬂicer in do.

fault shall have been ﬁxed by the judgment of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction,
§ 2. That thejudgment shall have been satisﬁed.

§ 1 Head, 558-9.

~ 2995. The clerk or Justice of the Peace shall, in such case, E.,d.,,,e,,..,,,.
endorse upon the execution at whose instance it is sued out, W be mam
and take from such persons, bond with security in a sufficient
amount for the costs and damages which may accrue. [Ib.]

chaser, aud scirefacias sued out, set aside the satisfaction en
tered, and revive the original judgment or decree for the ben
eﬁt of the said purchaser. [Act 1849-50, ch. 119.]
§ 2997. If a judgment or decree be that the party recover or be put in possession of the speciﬁc property, real or personal,
the court may carry the same into effect by writ of possession,
or other process sufficient for the purpose.
The writ of possession is the appropriate process where real property is recov
ered ; but may now issue on judgments for real or personal property. Car. Law
suit, § 424. Where the plaintiff succeeds in dctinue, the judgment is that he re
cover the property detained, or its value, and also, in either event, damages for
ts detention. Waite v. Dolby, 8 Humph. 406, 410', Molloy v. McDaniel, l Tenn.

§ 222; Cur. Lawsuit, Q 428.

And this is also the form of judgment where the de

fendant. recovers in replevin. Q 3390. And in either case, the jury make such 5
valuation as will be likely to effect a return of the speciﬁc property. 8 Humph.
§ 410 ; inﬁu, Q 3391. " The practice analogous to the common law in such cases
would be, to issue, ﬁrst, a. dislringas for the thing recovered, and if that he re
turned unsuccessful, to issue the writ ofﬁeri fnciae for the value, as assessed by
the jury. 8 Humph. 411. In Molloy v. McDaniel, 1 Tenn. 222, a distri-ngasissucd
for the property, and a ea. sa. for the damages. The dislr-ingaa was levied up
on other property, and the defendant committed under the ca. sa.. The diytringas

having ﬁailcd of its effect, (that is, to constrain the defendant to return the speci
ﬁc property,) :1 ﬁerifaciaa was awarded ; but whether aﬁer-i facias could have
issued in the ﬁrst instance, was not decided. The capiae ad satisfacienclum was
abolished in this State by the Act 1841-2, ch. 3, Q 2. But it is believed that the

proper practice with us in such cases is, to issue a writ, (by whatever name it may

be called,) conforming to the terms of the judgment; that is, commanding the
sheriff, ﬁrst, to take and restore to the successful party the property recovered,
and also to make of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the defendant,
(and in case the recovery is against the plnintiﬂ‘ in replevin, of those of his surety
in the replevin bond,) the damages assessed by the jury for its detention ; or, if
the speciﬁc property cannot be had, to make, etc., of the defendant, (and in case
ofa recovery against the plaintiffin rcplevin, of his surety in the replcvin b0nd,)
the value of the property as assessed by the jury, and also the damages (as before
stated,) for its detention. See Car. Lawsuit, Q 428. This process is resolvable in
to three parts, (1) a command to restore the property; or, (2) to make its value;

and in either event, (3) to make the damages for its detention.

For, where the

defendant succeeds in replevin, he is entitled to the damages for the detention,
whether the property is returned or not. Haskins v. Everett, 4 Sneed, 531, 533.

And the damages constitute adistinct item of recovery. Ib. And are assessed
separately by the jury. Nashville Ins. St Trust Co. v. Alexander, 10 Humph.
§ 378, 383 ; Sayers v. Holmes, 2 Cold. 259, 263.

And this is also the rule where the

plaintiifsucceeds in detinue. 1 Tenn. 222; B Humph. 410.
In ejectmmt the judgment is enforced by the writ of possession, haberc faciaa
poescssionem. Q 3251. And of course, execution for costs. If the plaintiff is put
in possession of land not embraced in his recovery, the defendant is restored to
possession by.a writ of restitution. Blair v. Pathkiller, 5 Yerg. 230; Hickman
v. Dule, 7 Yerg. 149.
In forcible entry and detainer, the judgment is enforced by execution for costs

and a writ of possession, the form of which is given in Q 3359.

Or if the cause

is taken to the Circuit Court and there decided, or was originally brought in that
court, thejudgment is also for damages, including rent. if 3363, 3364, 8367. In
such case aﬁeri facias would issue for the damages and costs, responding to so
much of the judgment as is for the recovery of money; and a writ of possession
to put the plaintiff in possession of the premises. It is believed that these two
writs are, in practice, frequently combined in one.-Eds.

Executions must pursue the judgment.

Saunders v. Gallaher, 2 Hnmph. 445;

Lee v. Crossna, 6 Hnmph. 281; Cubiness v. Garrett, 1 Yerg. 491 ; Jennings v
Pray, S Yerg. 85, 88; Trotter v. Nelson, 1 Swan, 7, 10. Thus where the judg.
ment is against two, and the execution against one. 2 Hnmph. 445 ; Love v. Smith,

§ 4 Yerg. 117, 130.

An execution which omits the name of one of the defendants

is irregular, erroneous and voidable; and if properly brought to the notice of the
court in due time, and in a. proceeding for that purpose, will be quashed or super

seded. 6 Hnmph. 281.

But it is not void so as to invalidate a levy and sale under

it. Nor can separate executions issue against the several defendants on a joint
judgment. Boyken v. State, 8 Yerg. 426. And if one of several joint defendants
die after judgment, and the plaintiff elects to take out execution against the sur
vivors, without reviving the judgment by scire facias against the personal repre
sentatives of the deceased defendant, the execution must conform to the judgment,

and be taken out against all the joint defendants. 1 Yerg. 491 ; 9 Hnmph. 542
And this rule applies where the execution has been stayed, and the principal debt
or has died. In such case, the plaintiff, suggesting the death ofthe principal, has
execution against both, to be levied of the property of the survivor. Ib. And see
Chcatham v. Brien, 2 Head, 552. ‘And so, where judgment is recovered in the

name of one person, for the use of another, the execution cannot omit the name
of the nominal plaintiff. 8 Yerg. 88. But where the judgment was in favor of
Levi Baker, and tho execution was in favor of B. S. Payne for the use of Levi
Baker, this, though irregular, was not void; for the real plaintiff was the same in
both. Barnes v. Hays, 1 Swan, 804, 306. And where a judgment was rendered
in favor of Stevenson for the use of Cook, and execution issued in favor of Steven

son, saying nothing about “the use of Cook," this, though irregular, was such s.
process as the sheriff was bound to execute. Stevenson v. McLain, 5 Hnmph.
§ 332. And an execution blank as to the amount, without referringto the endorse
ment where the sum is stated, is void. Maxwell v. King, 3Yerg. 460. But where

the judgment was for $328.18 1-2, and the execution for $319.06, this was held
such an error as would render the execution voidable, but would not avoid a sale

under it. 1 Swan, 11.

It seems from this last case, that if an execution is so in

formal as not to identify the court from which it issues, and the suit in which it
issues, it is void: for slight variances or defects, it is voidable merely.

§ 300l. Court executions are tested of the ﬁrst day of the
term next before the date of issuance; Justices’ executions of

The taste oi‘ the execution is important from the fact that theﬁ. fa. is a lien on
the debtor’s goods from its testc. See note to Q 2980, page 1279. If the judg
ment was rendered at a special term, the ﬁrst execution regularly issuing there upon is tested of the ﬁrst day of the special term, and not of the ﬁrst day of the
preceding regular term. Schnller v. Wickersham, 7 Cold. 876, 379. The rule
stated on page 1280, ante, note 4, that where executions issue from different courts,
priority of testc prevails, does not apply in a contest between a State court and a

Federal court.

In such a case priority of levy prevails.

§ See
§ 2.1 Q 4551, note (a); Q 2819 and note.
The provision requiring a bill of costs upon executions “ written in words at
length,” was repeated in the Act of 1779, ch. 4, Q 4 ; 1784, ch. 7, Q 8; 1794, ch.
§ 1,@ 75, and" 1796, ch. 7, Q 9. The repetition of this enactment indicates that
the abuse against which it was aimed had been kept up, notwithstanding the ﬁrst
prohibition. And lest the abuse should be persisted in, we set it down “in words
atfull len_ql/1,” that executions without the prescribed bill oi‘ costs annexed are

void, and will be so treated when questions are made on them.

I

Hopkins v
Such executions are illegal and void, and the sheriff a

trcspasser who executes the same. Hopkins v. Goodbehire, 2 Yerg. 241, 246.
And an execution for coats only, where the items of cost are not so set out, is so

far void, that a sale of land under it communicates no title. Walleu v. Mctienry,
§ 2 Yerg. 810-314; Mciienry v. Wallen, Ib., 441, 444-447. In the former case,
however, the plaintiff was the purchaser. Ib., 312. It was thought also, that if
the judgment had been for a debt and costs, the execution might have been good
as to the debt, and void as to the costs; this by analogy with Glasgow v. Smith,
§ 1 Tenn. 144, which see. These decisions are grounded on the strong language of
the original Act, not carried into the Code, namely: “and all executions issuing
without the bill of costs so annexed, shall be deemed illegal, and no sheriif shall
serve or execute the same.” In retaxing costs upon such a bill, the clerk of the
Supreme Court will reject all fees not set out in accordance with the statute, “as
illegal evidence of the fact that such costs are due, and upon which he dare not
act." 2 Yerg. 245. But Arabic numerals, expressive of numbers or sums, are
“words at length," within the meaning of the statute. 2 Ycrg. 282; Ib., 245.

With this exception, all the items for which any charge is mado—the miles
traveled, the numberof ferrisges made, the number of days each witness attended,
should be stated, and the amount due for this service. An item taxed thus:
“Witness, William Johnson, 36, 10," is not taxed in accordance with the stat
ute. 2 Yerg. 245. And a bill which sets out the whole costs in a single item,
thus,—“Bill of costs from the Supreme Court of Law and Equity for the Hamilton

District,” is the grossest violation of the statute. 2 Yerg. 445.

Under the Act of 1801, ch. '7, Q 6, prescribing the period for the return ofjus
tices’ executions, it was held that the failure to return such an execution within
the time prescribed by law, would not vitiate proceedings under it. Shell v. Hud
dleston, 2 Tenn. 39. And the plaintiff might instruct the oﬂicer to proceed under
the execution instead of returning it, and when this was dono, the otﬁcer was

not liable for a non-return.

Kennedy v. Smith, 7 Yerg. 472.

But under the Act

of 1835, ch. 17, E 4, as above, the oilicer was required to return the justice‘s exe
cution within thirty days. If not so returned, it became jimctus qﬁicio, and would
not authorize a levy after thirty days; and it was indispensable that it be return
ed, and that an alias issue in order to the subsequent proceedings; and where a
levy had been made in due time, and the plaintiff had agreed to a postponement
of the sale, this did not excuse afailure to retum the execution in due time, and
the oﬁiccr would still be liable to a motion by the plaintiﬁ for a non-return.

to the best of the 0ﬂicer’s knowledge, there be no such goods
and chattels, or not suﬂicient to answer the plaintiff’s demand,

the same shall be executed upon the lands and tenements.

[Act1777, ch. 2, § 29; 179t,¢1t. 1, §2a.]
As to the general principle of the primary liability of the debtor’s personalty,
see note to Q 2258.
The above statute is directory. Trigg v. McDonald, 2 Humph. 886, 889; Crow
der v. Sims, 7 Humph. 257-9. The provision is for the beneﬁt of the defendant
in the execution. If he waive the beneﬁt and wish the land sold ﬁrst, a sale of the

land would be valid, without the return of“ no goods and chattels found.”

But

the plaiutiti‘ cannot dictate to the otlicer whether he will sell the defendant’s land

or personalty ; and if the officer made the money out of the defendant’s land, a re
turn of nulla. brma. would not be necessary to justify him against a motion of the
plaintiff in the execution. 2 Humph. 389. \Vhere the execution was against sev
eral defendants, the purchaser acquired a good title to the land, although the per

sonalty of all was not ﬁrst exhausted. 7 Humph. 258.

The dictum of this case is

to the effect that the failure of the sheriff to show in his return that there was no
property on which to levy, would not, in any case, avoid a sale of realty. Ib., 259.
But in a later case, which was a motion against a sheriff for an insuﬂicient return,
viz: “ No personal property to be found in my county, of E. W. Tipton, [one
of the defendants,] on which I can levy," etc.,—it was said without controverting
the doctrine of Crowder v. Sims, that it is the duty of the sheriff by positive law,
whether the statute be construed to be imperative or merely directory—ﬁrst, to
levy on the personal property of the defendantor defendants before making a levy
on land. If there be several defendants all primarily liable, the sheriff may pro

ceed against the goods and chattels of either one to levy the whole debt, leaving
the question of contribution to be settled among the defendants. And if some of
the defendants thus liable, have personal property liable to the satisfaction of the
debt, and others have not, it is the duty of the sheriff to proceed against the former,
or either of them, until property sufficient is found to discharge the debt.

He can

not screen himself from liability by returning that one of the several defendants
bad no property subject to execution. To protect him, the return must show that
the money could not have been made out of either defendant. Hassell v. South
ern Bank of Kentucky, 2 Head, 381. To sustain an action against a sheriff for a
violation of this statute, the plaintiff must show: 1. That there was personal
property on which the levy could have been made. 2. That it was known to the

sheriff.

§ 3. That it was accessible to the sheriff.

And the burden of proof is on

the plaintiff. If the plaintiff makes the necessary proof, the law will intend that
the levying upon real property, when personal could be had, was done maliciously.

Swingle v. Boyler, 1 Tenn. 226, 228. But the law authorizes the levying upon
real property as well as personal at the same time, though the personal property
must he ﬁrst sold. 1 Tenn. 229. And ifafter a levy on realty, the sheriﬂ‘ discov
er personal property, it seems that it would be his duty to levy on that and sell it,

before he could sell the land.

Hogshead v. Carruth, 5 Yerg. 227, 229.

§ 3027. A description of the property levied on, with the Levy,
date of the levy, shall be endorsed upon or appended to the
execution. [Act 1838, ch. 190, § 1.]
What is a good levy on realty/.—It must be suﬂiciently descriptive to enable the
purchaser to ascertain the value of the thing he is buying. Huddleston v. Garrett,
§ 3 Humph. 629-30; Latferty v. Conn, 8 Sneed, 221, 224; Gibbs v. Thompson, 7
Humph. 179. Thus, if the interest levied upon is a remainder interest, it must
be so speciﬁed in the levy. Such an interest will not pass by sale where the levy
is upon the estate in general terms. Kissom v. Nelson, 2 Heisk. 4, 8. The
levy ought to show the lomtion of the lands levied on to a reasonable certain
ty. Pound v. Pullen, 3 Yerg. 888. But if the description is otherwise sufficient
ly certain, the levy is good, although it omit to state the county in which the land
lies; for the law will presume that it lies in the county of the levying ofﬁcer.

Wright v. Watson, ll Humph. 629.

It should describe the tract levied on in such

a manner as to distinguish it from all other tracts owned by the same person.

Vance v. McNairy, 3 Yerg. 171, 177; Wright v. Watson, 1_l Humph. 529-30.

In

Gibbs v. Thompson, our cases on this subject, taken together, wereheld to rest on
these two principles :

§ 1. That the purchaser must have the means of knowing what land is to be sold,
so as to form some estimate of its value.
§ 2. That there must be such ascertainment, by description, of identity, as shall
prevent one piece of land from being sold and a distinct piece conveyed. 7 Humph.
§ 179, 181 ; 8 Sneed, 225. That is, such a general description, as will, by reasons.
ble intendment, connect it with the sale and deed, so that purchasers may know
the land to be sold, and form some estimate of its value, and that the sheriff mak

ing the sale, or his successor, looking to the levy, may know what land to convey;
and not sell one tract and convey another. Brigancc v. Erwin, 1 Swan, 375, 378 ;
Parker v. Swan, 1 Humph. 80, 84. The title of the purchaser does not rest on
the description contained in the levy, but the deed follows, and deﬁnes its locality
with suflicient precision. 1 Humph. B4. The deed founded upon the levy may
contain a more full and perfect description, but it must be consistent with that
contained in the levy ; and it must appear from the levy and deed, that the land
named in each is the same. l Swan, 878. The same specialty of description is
not necessary when the sheritf‘s deed follows, constituting the purchase-r’s title,
as would be required were the title to rest on the levy. 8 Yerg. 177-8. And sce'
the same principle recognized in Trotter v. Nelson, 1 Swan, 7, 13. But in Helms
v. Alexander, 10 Humph. 44, it is said that the principle established by the cases
in 1 Humphreys and 8 Yerger, that a defective description of the land levied on,
in the sheriﬂ"s retum of levy, may, in some cases, be cured by a full and accurate

description in the sheriff 's deed, has been extended in those cases quite as far as
we deem it safe to go. 10 Humph. 44, 46.

The levy may contain in itself the de

gree of certainty required, and that is the better practice; but if it refer to a deed
or other title paper of record to which convenient access may be had, it thereby
incorporates in itself the description in the deed or title paper referred to. So the

levy may have the requisite certainty by reference to natural or artiﬁcial objects
on the land, or to adjoining lands. 1 Swan, 879. But if the description in the
levy is not of itself suﬁcient, it is not aided by reference to the advertisement of
the sale in a newspaper. Tayler v. Cozart, 4 Humph. 483. Otherwise if the
advertisement is copied into the return and referred, for it then becomes apart of
the record. Gibbs v. Thompson, 7 Yerg. 179, 182.

Levies described in the following terms have been held good:
§ 1. “ Levied on the right, title, claim and interest that John Doak has in and to
seventy acres of land lying on the waters of the west fork of Stone's river." 1
Humph. 80, 84.
§ 2. A levy upon a tract of land in White county, of 1548 acres and one bun
dred and thirty nine poles ; also 2404 acres, and 110 poles in the same county. A list of the advertisement and description of‘ the land is hereto annexed. Then
Getting out a copy of the advertisement containing a full description of the land.

§ 7 Hnmph. 181.

Levies described in the following terms have been held void for uncertainty:
§ 1. “ Leried on Lot No.—,in the town of Greenville, with its improvements." 2

Hnmph. 895.
§ 2.__“ Levied on eight thousand acres of land lying in four different tracts, April
§ 28, 1810." 3 Yerg. 388.
§ 3. “ Levied this execution on three tracts of land, one containing 80 or 40 acres,
one other containing 110 acres, as the property of Haywood Cozart, all in the
county of Carroll. See advertisement in newspapers for description." 4 Hnmph.
§ 4. “ Levied on three hundred and ﬁfty acres of land, the property of Edmund
Collins, this 7th of May, 1846.” 8 Sneed, 221, 225.
§ 5. “Levied this execution on a tract of land adjoining the land of James l\1<-Don.
del, Thomas Cannon and others, containing one hundred and sixty acres.” But

in this case thenotice to the tenant in possession was variant from the levy; and
other peculiar facts seem to distinguish it from the other cases. 10 Hnmph. 44.
§ 6. “Levied, 29th August, 1825, on nineteen hundred and ﬁfty acres of land in
Henderson county, part of tract of 2500 acres, located by Daniel Gilchrist." 1
Swan, 875.

§ 3028. Whet'e the udgment or decree is against a principal On pronertyot
and his surety, it shall be the duty of the oﬁicer having tiiepmwlwmﬂ J
collection thereof, to exhaust the property of the principal, both
real and personal, before proceeding to scll the property of the i
surety.

[Act 1820, ch. 151, § 6; 1843, ch. 32, § 1.]

This statute is directory to the officer. Atkinson v. Rhea, 7 llumph.
Cl1eut':|;|m v. Brien, 3 Head, 552, 554; Anderson v. Talbot, 1 Heisk. 407,
he disregard this direction, and thereby the surety is injured, the officer
in damages to the party aggrieved; but the execution and sale of the

§ 59, 61;
§ 414. If
is liable
property

of the surety will be good and valid, notwithstanding the principal had property
that might have been seized. '7 Hnmph. 59, 61. It plainly cont:-mplutes that the
principal shall be possessed of property subject to immediate execution, on which
the oﬂicer may directly proceed to make a levy, without the risk of personal lia.
bility, and without the necessity, on his part, of resorting to any legal measure;
for the removal ofany obstacle that may exist in th0wn_v of the immediate seiz
ure of the property. Consequently, if the property of the principal be encum
bered, or in custody of the law; or, if by the death of the principal, it cannot be
reached without reviving the judgment against the personal representative; or
from any other cause is not amenable to the immediate requirement of the pro
cess in the officer's hand, he not only may, but it is his positive duty, to proceed
at once against the property of the surety. It was not the intention ofthis pro
vision of‘ the Code that the creditor should be subjected to the trouble and delay
of removing legal obstacles out of the way of a levy on the property of his prin
cipnl debtor, before being permitted to subject the property of the surety. In
such case it was deemed more reasonable and just to lcuve the surety, who had
Voluntarily made himself liable to the satisfaction of‘ the judgment, to tnlre upon

§ 82 TENN. srxr.

The statute is for the protection of the surety, and if‘ he submits to a sale of his property before that of his prin
cipal is exhausted, no one else can be heard to complain. The fact that the sheriﬂ
levied upon and sold the property of the surety, without showing in his return
that there“was “ no property, real or personal, of the principal to be found on

which to levy,” is it ciruunistaiice that cannot be taken advantage of by the
surety’s vendee _in a bill to remove the cloud upon his title by reason of such q
sale. Anderson v. Talbot, 1 Heisk. 407, 414. If the execution has been levied on
the property ofgthe principal, sufficient to satisfy the judgment, the levy is a satis
faction so far as the surety is concerned, and discharges the surety. Finlay v.
King, 1 Head, 123; Nance v. Bell, B Humph. 26 ; Young v. Whitcoinb, 3 Yerg.
§ 297; Slierrill v. Goodrum, 3 Humph. 419, 431. And see Pigg v. Sparrow, 8
Hayw. 144, Cooper's Edition, and cases cited. Hence, a levy on suflicient prop~
erty of the principal to satisfy the debt cannot be abandoned, and an alias taken
out and levied on the property of the surety. 1 Head, 128. And in an action
against the sureties of an cﬂiccr it isa good plea that enough of their pi1'ncipal’s
property was levied on to satisfy the debt. 3 Humph. 431. But where the urety
has paid the judgment and instituted an action against the principal, the principal
cannot plead that enough of his property was levied on to satisfy the judgment. 8 Humph. 26.

Bond oflndemmm

§ 3032. No sheriﬁ‘ or other oﬂiucr shall be required to levy
an execution on any property the title of which is disputed, or
to sell the saine after levy, unless the plaintiff will ﬁrst give
bond and security to such oflieer, to indemnify hiiu against all

daiiiages and costs in consequence of the levy or sale.
[Act 1825, ch. 40, §§ 1, 2.]
Before the passage of this Act, the collecting oﬂicer was bound to know at In‘: peril, whether the property upon which he was about to levy, belonged to the de
fendant in the execution or not. If it did, and he failed to levy and sell, he was

liable to the plaintiff; and if it did not, and he levied and sold, he was liable for
§ 8. trespass to the real owner. It was to relieve collecting officers from this
responsibility that the Act \vas passed. Hamhlet v. Hemdon, 3 Humph. 34, 86;
Jobe v. Sellnrs, 9 Humph. 178, 181. Unless a bond of indemnity is tendered, he
is not bound to levy and sell in any case where the rightof propertyisin dispute;
as, where the property had been coui-eyed in trust after the execution came into
his hands. Saunders v. Harris, 4 Humph. 72. And if after levy he discover that
the property levied on is in dispute, he is not bound to notify the plaintiff in the
execution of this fnct and demand indemnity, but may lawfully release the levy
without so doing. State v. Sharp, 2 Sneed, 615. And although such la bond is
tendered, he may at his peril, refuse to levy and sell. 3 Humph. 84. A bond of
indemnity executed by a stranger to thejudgmcnt, is a valid statutory bond, and
the obligor is liable on motion to the sheriff. 9 Humph. I78. The sheriff is eh
titled to substitution to the rights of the plaintiff, where the execution defendant
recovers judgment against him, and no bond of indemnity has been taken.

execution
debtor. [Act 1819, ch. 48, § 1 ; 1794, ch. 5, § 7.]
The effect of a sale ofland held by entry merely, is to make the purchaser owner
of the land. The direction of the statute that the sheriff assign oflicinlly the
warrant or plat and certiﬁcate of survey, was intended for the beneﬁt and protec
tion of the purchaser, to the end that he might cause the grnntto issue in his own
name. It was not intended in any degree for the beneﬁt of the entcrer or former
owner of the land. It was not intended that after the sale, the eiiterer, whose
land had been sold should continue in possession of the same until the purchaser
or his nssignee might get n grant in his own name. 'l'he shert:ﬂ"s deed, with the
entry, constitutes valid evidence of a legal sale against tho eutcrcr in possession,
and enables the purchaser as against him, to recover in ejeetment. Lee v. Crossna,
§ 6 Humph. 281. Thesale itself vests the legal title in the purchaser, without trans.
fer of the entry and warrant. Hence, if after the snle the execution debtor obtain
n grant, he holds it as trustee for the purchnser. Bumpas v. Gregory, 8 Yerg. 46,

And so, u fraudulent assigiiee of the plat and certiﬁcate, or his vendee with

notice, holds the legal title as trustee of the purchaser at the execution snle, nnd
equity will divest Ihelegsl title out of him, and vest it in the purchaser or his heirs,
Burrow v. Smith, 2 Sneed, 566. The purchaser acquires the same interest in the
land which tho enterer hns; that is, if there be land appropriated he takes it; if
none, he takes the wnrrnnt with authority to locate it elsewhere. If there be

neither land nor warrant, he t:|l:cs nothing.‘ 8 Yerg. 5'7.

There is no distinction

under the statute, between entries under the Act of Congress, and those founded

upon North Carolina warrants. Both are alike subject to execution. He-ﬁly V,
Hall, 5 lilunpli. 581. An orcupancy on the lnnds of the United Suites south and
west of the Congressional Reservaiion Line, is not subject to execution. Such oc
cupants nre simply trespassers upon the lands of the United- States. Brown v,

[Act 1799, ch. 14, §1 ; 1855-6, ch. 83.]

Reason and policy of this statute :—To prevent execution sales being so secretly
and clandestinely conducted, that real estates may be sold without any regard to
their value. Trott v. McGavock, l Yerg. 469, 471. It was intended to guard the
freehold, and protect the owner of the land from having it taken away without his
knowledge, and without giving him an opportunity of discharging the debt by pay
ment ot‘ money. Loyd v. Anglin, 7 Yerg. 428, 431. Or of laying oﬁ' the tract in
lots, [next secti0n,] so that no more should be sold than a sufficiency to pay the
debt. Noe v. Purchapile, 5 Yerg. 215-16. The object of the act was that the de
fendant have notice of the time and place of the sale. Knowledge of the levy, as
where the execution debtor had requested the sheriff to levy on a particular tract,
is not suﬂicient. Mitchell v. Lipe, 8 Yerg. I79, 181. The place ol‘ sale must also
be stated in the notice; otherwise the sale is void. Hinson v. Hinson, 5 Sneed,
§ 822. The statute applies to the case of a venditiani ezponaa issued from the
County Court,[now Circuit Court,] upon u. justice‘s judgment and constable’s levy.

[Q 3380-3084.] Rogers v. Jennings, 3 Yerg. 308, 310.

Where three tracts, though

-or-.

adjoining, were held by separate titles, the defendant was only entitled to notice as
to the tract on which he resided. Farquhar v. Toney, 5 Humph. I502. Unless the
execution debtor is in actual possession, no notice is necessary. It is not necessary
to notify his tenant. Crowder v. Sims, 7 Humph. 257. The notice must describe
lhl land correctly, or it is a nullity. Helms v. Alexander, 10 Humph. 44.
Unless the notice required by the statute is given, the sale is absolutely void,

and communicates no title to the purchaser. Trott v. McGavock, 1 Yerg. 469, 480;
Loyd v. Auglin, 7 Yerg. 428, 431 ; Farquhar v. Toney, 5 Humph. 502; Mitchell
v. Lipe, 8 Yerg. 179, 181. The purchaser must take care what he buys, and
must, at his peril, know that the sheriff has done his duty, and that the sale will
be valid. 1 Yerg. 432.
Service of the notice.--The debtor is entitled to a written notice of the time

and place of the sale, to be served by t/u qﬂicer having charge of the execution,
and no valid sale can be made without it, unless he expressly waive his right.
It is not a compliance with the statute, nor it safe construction of it, to hold that
if the debtor have twenty or more days’ notice of the time and place of the sale
b_y certain other mean», that shall be equivalent to the service of the written
notice required by the statute. The notice must be sew-vrcl on him; or if he is
absent, so that it cannot actually be served, it must be left for him in proper

hands at his residence, so that he may get it.

The right conferred upon the

debtor by the statute should not be laken izway by construction ; and the duty i‘.

imposes upon the oﬂicer is plain and simple, and can better be'perl'0rmed in the
manner required by the statute, than in any other manner which he might suppose
to be equivalent. Richards v. Meeks, ll Humph. 455. Hence, where the ofliicer

instead of giving the debtor notice in the manner required by the statute, posted
a notice of the sale on the front door of a shop used by the debtor, this was held
not to be a compliance with the statute, although the notice were read lo or by the
debtor, or he knew 1'86 conlents morethau twenty day: before the sale. Ib. But
see Noe v. Purchapile, 5 Yerg. 315, and the other eases cited below, as to the
waiver of the notice. The statute does not require pm-sonal'seri-ice ; and such a
construction would in many cases, place it in the power of the debtor to defeat a

sale by evading service.

The sheriff should serve the notice personally, if it can

be done; but if it cannot ho done, then he may leave it at the residence of the party.
Ifleft at the dwelling house of the party, it should be handed to some member of the
family ; or, if that cannot be done, then it should be placed in some such conspicuous
place in the house, as necessarily to attract the attention of the party on his returm
A notice thrown carelessly into the house or upon the steps, or under the door,.
would not be sufﬁcient. White v. Chestnut, ll Humph. 79. The return, and

statement of the sheriﬂ‘ in the deed, that he left the notice at the dwelling
house of the defendant, are to be taken as implying prima facie, that personal
service could not be effected, and that the mode of service adopted, by leaving
notice at the residence of the party, was in all respects regular and proper;
leaving it to the party interested in establishing the contrary, to show that the
fact was otherwise. 11 Humph., 79. But leaving the notice with a tenant residing
on the laud, or with a woman, “ with whom the defendant had been in the habit
of living," was held to be no compliance with the statute, although the defendant
was, at the time, absent in another State. Lafferty v. Conn, 8 Sneed, 321, 323, 825_
The notice may be waived by express words, or acts equivalent thereto. Car
ney v. Carney, 1 Yerg. $91. And it is said that proofof service of notice will not
be required, if it clearly appear that the defcndanthnd all the knowledge such no
tice would communicate, and was actually present at the sale. Noe v. Purcha
pile, 5 Yerg. 215-16. But sec Richards v. Meeks, ut supra. And where the exe
cution defcndant procured tho purchaser to buy the land, he thereby evinced that
he had all the information a written notice would communicate, and the pur
chaser had a t'l;.'{l1t to suppose the notice had been regularly given. To hold that
a sale made under such circumstances is void for want of the statutory notice,
would be departing from the spirit of the act, and sticking to the letter merely;
it would be allowing the defendant to defeat a title acquired by his procurement
and partly for his beneﬁt, and enable him to practice a gross fraud upon the PUP

chaser.
the sale, stood by at the time, and had an understanding with the purchaser for
his beneﬁt, all this amounts to a waiver of the notice. 5 Yerg. -517, approved in
§ 10 Yerg. 492. In all cases where the defendant is present, assisting at the sale,
or by other act evinces his willingness that it should go on, it is a waiver of the
notice required by the statute, or evidence that the notice was actually given.
§ 10 Yerg. 492. But the fact that the execution defendant was present at the sale
of the laud, and does not object to it and notify the bidders that he has not had
the notice, is not a waiver of the notice. 10 Yerg. 492. So, the fact that the
defendant was in town on the day of the sale was not a waiverbf the notice.
Hinson v. Hinson, 5 Sneed, 822, 324.
EvidéﬂC6.——The recital of the fact of service of notice in the return, or in the
Bheriﬂ"s deed, is prirna facie evidence that the notice was given, but subjcctto
rebuttal by proof, notwithstanding the rule that parol evidence is not admissible t0
contradict a deed. Loyd v.Anglin, 7 Yerg. 428; Simmons v. McKissick, 6 Humph.
§ 259; Rogers v. Jennings, 3 Yerg. 808; White v. Chestnut, 11 Humph. '79, 80,81 ;
Elliott v. Schultz, 10 Humph. 234. And the onus is upon the pnrty denying that
the notice was given. 8 Yerg. 809; 6 Humph. 261. And where the notice was
left at the defendant's house, the question whether he had notice was one for the
jury.

of the lands levied on, subscribed by him, and it shall, in that
case, be the duty of the oﬂicer to sell, according to said plan,
so much of the land as may be necessary to satisfy the debt
and costs, and no more. - If no such plan is furnished, the of
ﬁcer may sell without any division. [Act 1799, ch. 1-1, § 3.

The bond must be in writing.

A parol agreement to be responsible for the

delivery of the property levied upon, will not support an execution against the

pl'0mi.-—'0r, [under Q 3046,] and such an execution, and all proceedings thereon,
are l'lllllll.ll'§. Martill v. England, 5 Yerg. 813. As the liability of the surety is
the only thing to be attained by the bond, the principal need not join in it. There
fore the surely is bound, whether the debtor sign or not. Hence, if an agent of

the principal debtor transcend his authority in executing the bond, so that the
principal is not bound by the bond for every article mentioned in it, still the
surety would be bound to the full extent of the bond. Love v. Smith, 4 Yerg.
§ 117, 126-'7. 'The bond must be executed “payable to the creditor," and not to
the sheriff. A dclivery bond taken to the shei-iﬂ' is not embraced in the Act of

Assembly; and whatever ell'ect it might have as a common law obligation, yet
the plaintiff derives no beneﬁt from it. It cannot be taken as any part of the re
turn ; does not have the effect of releasing the property, and does not authorize
a summary judgment. The right of property being ﬁxed in the sheriﬂ‘ by the
levy, is not changed by the execution ofsuch u bond, and the sheriff may proceed
to sell I10lWlll|.~'f.1!I'|(lll\g the same. And if in such n care, an alias execution
issued, wus levied on the same property, and a second delivery bond taken, this

would not alter the right ﬁxed by the ﬁrst seizure, and the sureties in the second
delivery bond would not be liable. Carroll v. Field, 6 Yerg. 305, 308. The bond
may not be good as a statutory bond, and yet may be valid as a common law
bond. Brown v. McDonald, 8 Yerg. 158, 161. And see Goodrum v. Carroll, 2

Humph. 490.

Mistakes and omissions in the bond will be relieved against in

equity. Helm v. Wright, 2 Humph. 72. If there be not time to sell the property
levied on before the return day of the proces, the sheriff being nevertheless bound
to take the bond, ifotfered may designate a day for the delivery of the property
beyond the tc4'm. And in such case, he may sell the property by virtue of the
process, just as he could do in case no bond had been executed, and he had taken
the property into his possession. Chcaires v. Alderson, 7 Humph. 273.

§ 30/I5. The sureties on a forfeited delivery bond shall not

shall be ascertained in a summary way by a jury of ﬁve dis
interested men, summoned by the oilicer making the levy or

holding the execution, whose valuation shall be ﬁnal.
[Act 1831, ch. 25, §1.
Before the Act of 1831, the sureties in a delivery bond, were in case of for
feiture, liable for the whole debt, without regard to the value of the property
levied upon. Love v. Smith, 4 Yerg. 117. And the rule that a levy on sullicient
property of the defendant to satisfy the demand, is a satisfaction of the judg
ment, applied, although a delivery bond had been taken and forfeited. Young Y.
Read, 3 Yerg. 297; Camp v. Laird, 6 Yerg. 246; Brown v. McDonald, 8 Yerg.
§ 158, 160. Hence, where a judgment was rendered against three persons, one as
principal and two as sureties, and was levied on the property of the principal, and‘.

a delivery bond executed by the principal and one of the sureties, in which the
other surety refused to join, and the bond was forfeited, and the judgment paid
by the surety who joined in the bond, it was held that the surety who did not
join in the bond, would not be forced in equity to contribute to his co-surety. B
But since the Act of 1831, ch. 25, to constitute a satisfaction of the judgment,
the property levied upon, must be of value sufficient to puy it, inasmuch as the
Surety in the delivery bond is only responsible for its value; and if it be not of
Value sufficient, it is only a satisfaction pro ianto. Kercheval v. Harney, Meigs, 404,
§ 411. And see Carnes v. Pickett, 2 Sneed, 655. The plaintiff is entitled to judg- .
ment against the sureties in the forfeited delivery bond, for the amount he lust by '
their failure lo comply with their conlract. Ib. Thus, where several executions
of the same teste are levied on the same property, the obligors in a de-livery bond

executed to the plaintiffs in one of them, conditioned to deliver the whole property,
will be bound to deliver only so much of it as will be of vulue sufficient to satisfy
the proportion to which the obligers would be entitled, as between themselves
and the plaintiffs in the other executions. Ib. Where astayor execute a delivery

'

bond and forfeit the same, he is thereby estopped from denying his original lia
bility.

Neil v. Beaumont, 3 Head, 627, 631.

§ 3046. The delivery bond, if forfeited,shall be, in the hands lF"p:felt.:gn<‘Ile
of the oﬁicer holding it, a suﬁicientauthority to levy upon and W
'
sell so much of the property of the sureties as will satisfy the
“amount for which they have made themselves liable; and shall
also be a sufﬁcient authority to the clerk or Justice to whom
the same may be returned, to issue an alias or plnries execution,
as the case may be, against the defendant to the judgment, and
against the sureties on said bond, without any judgment upon

the bond.

It seems that if the oﬂicer has become liable for the judgment, and has actually
satisﬁed it, he may, on the ground of an implied transfer of the bond for his bene

ﬁt, maintain an action on the bond.

This and the following section resolve, against the inclination of the court, the
doubt expressed in Williams v. Wright, 9 Humph. 493, 501, as to whether the
levy upon the property of one of the joint defendants, and the taking ofa delivery
bond with security from him, would operate as a satisfaction of the judgment so
as to discharge the other defendants. See Brown v. McDonald, 8 Yerg. 158, 160,

[Act 1857-8, ch. 163, §§ 13, 16.]
See Q 3034, and note.
As to other personal property, the rule is that whatever title existed in the
defendant at the time of the levy on the chattel, passes to the bidder at the sale
as soon as the hammer is down. Shaw v. Smith, 9 Yerg. 97, 100; Potter v.
Coward, Mcigs, 23, 26. And this~is the rule in case 0fMuster's sales. Curd v.
Bonner, 4 Cold. 632, 641 ; Polk v. Pledge, 5 Cold. 384, 388; Newman v. Sloan,
ti Cold. 890, 391. In consideration thereof, the defendant is bound to pay the
price bid, and the sheritf may maintain an action for the same, as was done in
Shaw v. Smilh, at supra. And where the sheriff at the request of the purchaser»
pays out of his own funds, the money bid at the sale, to the plaintiff, he may main
tain an action against the purchaser for the same. Nichol v. Ridley, 6 Yerg. 68.
Or if the oﬂicer refuse to deliver the property, the purchaser can recover it in
detinue. Floyd v. Goodwin, 8 Yerg. 484, 497; Meigs, 26. A bill of sale is un
necessary to ‘pass the title. 8 Yerg. 496-7; 9 Yerg. 101. No warranty is implied

either by the sheriﬂ' or by the plaintitf in the execution. 9 Yerg. 101.
likewise the rule when the sale is of realty. See note toﬁ 3056.

This is

§ 3054. On the sale of land by execution, the oﬁiccr sl1allC.,mc,¢,,,

stating the date of sale, the amount of the bid, the execution

as given in the levy.
It is settled that a sale of real estate by the sheriff is not within the statute of
frauds and perjuries. Nichol v. Ridley, 6 Yerg. 68, 65, and citations. And the
sheriff's return is such a memorandum in writing as takes such a sale out of the
statute of frauds. lb. But the retum is not a necessary link in the chain of the

purchaserls title.

See note to Q 8056.

execution, or the person succeeding to his rights, may, at any ‘ma’
time, either within or after the expiration of the two years al

lowed for redemption, demand from the oﬂieer or his successor a
deed, who shall execute it accordingly.
It is the settled law that to vest the purchaser of real estate at an execution
sale with the legal title thereto, a conveyance from the sheriﬂ‘ is indispensably

necessary.

Morgan v. Hnnnah, 11 Hnmph. 122, 125.

The purchaser is entitled

to his deed on the day of the sale, and to izlzntrdiatepossesriort of the land. Rogers
v. Cawood, 1 Swan, 142, 148; Q 2135, and note. In case the sheriff fail or refuse
to execute the conveyance, mandamus will lie to compel him to do so. Winters
v. Burford, 6 Cold. 328, 330. But a peremptory ma1zdmhua will not be granted to
compel asherilf to execute deeds for lots sold by his predecessor, when it appears

that several lots were sold together for an aggregate price. Ib.

See Q 2154, and

note. If such conveyance be made to a person other than the purchaser, it must
appear, upon the face of the deed, to have been so made by the express authority
and direction of such purchaser. ll Humph. 125. In this case, the question was
reserved whether or not a verbal direction to the sheriff would be sulﬁcient I0 au
thorize him to make the conveyance to a person other than the purchaser. Ib.
But it is held that the interest which the purchaser acquires, being merely equitable,

may be assigned by an informal writing, so as to entitle the assignee to demand
a conveyance of the legal title from the sheriff. As to third persons, it will be
presumed from the mere recital of the assignment in the sheriﬁ"s dc.-ed, that the
sheritf was authorized by the purchaser, to make the deed to another, under and
by virtue of the sale. Such an assignment need not be registered. Trotter v.

Nelson, 1 Swan, 7, 13.

The sheriffs deed is a conveyance of the debtor’s legal

title without warranty, express or implied, on the part of tho debtor, creditor or
sheriff. Henderson v. Overton, 2 Yerg. 394, 897. The purchaser takes precisely
as the defendant held, subject to all the equities to which he was subject, and
liable to convey to others the same as he was. Berry v. Walden, 4 Hnyw. 174,
§ 179; Tillery v. Simmons, 1 Tenn. 274, 286. 'I‘_hus, the interest of the execution
purchaser before deed is postponed to the right of dower. Harrell v. Harrell, 3

Cold. 877, 382.

See Q 2898, and note.

A sheriﬂ"s deed is a conveyance by stat

ute, and is composed of the judgment, the levy, and the sheriﬂ"s deed, as essen
tial requisites to its constitution, which the purchaser must see to, and on which
he must depend, -to effectuate the transfer of the right; either of which, if want

ing, renders the conveyance inoperative as to passing the right and title. Nelson
v. Allen,-1 Yerg. 860, 367. The sale depends upon the judgment, execution, levy
‘and sheriﬂ‘s deed. Rogers v. Cawood, 1 Swan, 142, 148 ; Mitchell v. Lipe, 8 Yerg.
§ 179, 182.

The sheriff's return docs not give validity to the sale; is not necessary

to a deraignment of tho purchaser’s title; is the single act of the sheriff after the
sale; is immaterial as evidence of title; and hence may be averrcd against; its
recitals in relation to the character of the title conveyed are not evidence, and
when its recitals conﬂict with those of the deed, the deed prevails. 1 Sn-an,
§ 148-9; 8 Yerg. 182-3. But the return is such a memorandum in writing, as
takes the sheriffs sale of realty out of the statute of frauds. Nichol v. Ridley, 5

Yerg. 63, 65.

As to the conditions necessary to give validity to sales of land for

taxes, see {Q 612-642 c, and note under Q 6420.

A levy on personally vests the sheriff with such a property in the goods, that
he may sell them after the return of the writ, or even after he goes out of oﬁoe

without a venditioni ezponas.

Overton v. Perkins, 10 Yerg. 328 ; Carroll v.

Fields, 6 Yerg. 305; Lester's case, 4 Humph. 883.

Upon the same principle, a

levy upon suﬂicient personalty to satisfy the demand, is in law a satisfaction of
the judgment, discharges the defendant and his suretiea from all liability occasioned
by virtue of any proceedings subsequent to such levy, and renders the sheriﬂ liable
to the plaintiff for thejudgment. This rule inits various applications is declared
or recognized in the following, and perhaps other cases: Pigg v. Sparrow, 3

Hayw. 144; Hogshead v. Carruth, 5 Yerg. 227; Overton v. Perkins, 10 Yerg,
§ 828; Sherrell v. Goodrum, 8 Humph. 419; Miller v. Estill, 8 Yerg. 452; Mclntyra

I1!
§ 1".

But where Ute levy is upon land, the sheriff acquires no special property in it by
virtue of the levy; he may abandon the levy and levy upon personalty. Hence,
a. levy upon realty is not a satisfaction ; nor can the sheriﬂ‘ sell real estate levied

upon after the return day.

In such case he must have a venditioni exponaa. Over

collector, which deeds shall be as valid as if executed by such
foriner oﬁicer. [Act 1809, ch. 84, §1.]
Where the successor of the tax collector who had sold the land, executed a deed
to the purchaser twelve years after the sale, without knowing anything of the ﬁicts
recited in the deed, but because he thought it his official duty to do so, it was held
that these circumstances were sufficient to rebut the presumption. created by the
statute in favor of the deed. Randolph v. Metcalf, 6 Cold. 400, 404, 409. See

§ 3059. On all judgineuts before Justices of the Peace, the slay ot'execn
deteiidant is entitled to a stay of execution for eight months,

upon entering good and suﬂicient security on the Justice’s
docket
for debt,after
interest
and costs, ofljudgtnent.
within two entire days, Sun
days excepted,
the rendition
The Act of 1868-9, ch. 26, Q 1, provided that there should be no stay of execu
tion on judgments of less than twenty-ﬁve dollars in favor of daily laborers, me

chanics and house servants for work 8!1(llIib0!‘ done. Section 2 of the same Act
provided that no property should be exempt from execution for the satisfaction
of any such judgments. This Act was repealed by the Act of 1869-70, ch. 97.
The justice has no power, except under the provisions of the statute, to receive
and enter security for the stay of execution ; and no undertakings for the stay of

execution are valid, unless entered into in pursuance of these laws.

Neither the

magistrate nor the parties can be allowed to change these laws by contract; and
any such action of thejustice does not constitute a judicial or oﬂicial act. Appet
son v. Smith, 3 Sneed, 371, 374-5; citing 1 Sue-ed, 233; 4 Sneed, 146; Ib., 548;
§ 8 Humph. 701; and quoted approvingly in Noel v. Scoby, 1 Heisk. 20, 27-8.

The power is one ofjurisdiction and not of contract, and cannot be conferred by
consent ; for consent cannot conferjurisdictiou. 2 Heisk. 28; citing Agee v. Dem
ent, 1_ Humph. 332. And see Smith v. Martin, 7 Cold. 272, 276. But see the
dictum in Rothchilds v. Forbes, 2 Heisk. 13, 16, quoted under Q 8060.
“ For eight mont/ts.”—A slnyor cannot be bound as such by consent of the par
ties and himself to an obligation that varies from the general rule of the law on
the subject. A stay of an execution which differs from the general law is s mere
contract, and not the ﬁnal and conclusive judgment which the law contemplates.
The stay of an execution is in etfect a confusiovt ofjudgment, [Q 3066, and note,]

and the stnyor is liable on the law applicable to such judgment, and not other
wise. The stay cannot be for a part of the debt only, nor for a greater or less
term than that limited by law, nor otherwise varied from the general rule. Rob
erts v. Cross, 1 Sneed, 233; Smith v, Martin, 7 Cold. 274, 276. But see the dic
tum in Rothchilds v. Forbes, 2 Heisk. 13, quoted under Q 3060. Hence where the

stayor agreed to stay execution for three months, it was held
§ 1. That execution could not issue until the limit of the time allowed by law for
the stay, namely, eight months.

§ 2. That at the expiration of that period, execution might issue. both against
the principal defendant and stayor. l Sneed, 283.

And where the judgment was for $145, 72, and the stay was entered for only
$80, the stayor was not bound for any amount. 7 Cold. 272, 276. In such a
case the onus is not upon the stayor to show that he is not bound ; for the jus
tice's docket does not show that he is bound. lb.
“Two entire days," etc.—'l‘he'meaning of the expression “two entire days

after the judgment," is two entire days, exclusive of the day on arlticlt ;'ud_qment
was rendered. See Carson v. Love, 8 Yerg. 215. -And as to the computation of
time generally, see ante, Q 48, and citations. See note to next section.

Eut<7‘ing stag/.—ln Hickman v. Lewis, Mart. v. Yerg. 116, it is said that the
only safe and correct practice is for the stayor to sign his own name to the ac

knowledgment, by him-elf or his legally constituted attorney, or by directing the
justice in writing to do so, or that the justice enter the suretyship for the stay in
the presence of the party becoming the surety, and that the record of‘ the judg
ment on which execution is stayed, must be also present when the entry of stay is
made. This case is cited approvingly in Cnperton V. Gray, 4 Yerg. 568; Barnes
v. Dick, 9 Yerg. 430, 433, and Renms v. l\lc.\'ail, 9 Humph. 544; but overruled
as to the point that the entry must be made in the pa-(smce of the stayor, by
Hennegar v. Mee, 4 Snead, 33, 35, where it is Rllltl to be a dictum ; and overruled as to the necessity ofthe presence of the record, but without being cited, by Mor
gan v. Coleman, 3 Head, 352, and Cheatham v. Brien, 3 Head, 552, 554.
On this subject it has been held

§ 1. That unless the authorization to thejustice to enter the stayor’s nnme, is in
writing, it is void under the statute of frauds. Cnperton v. Gray, 4 Yerg. 363.
This case is in accord with Hickman v. Williams, ut supra ,' but both cases are
overruled by Morgan v. Coleman, 3 Head, 352, and Cheatham v. Brien, 3 Head,
§ 552.
§ 2. That where the supposed stayor had removed the judgment and execution
by ccrtiorari into the Gircuit Court, where the question as to the petitioner's lia
bility as stayor was submitted to ajury, it was material to show by a witness that
the petitioner was neither present when the stay of execution was entered, nor
signed or authorized the writing upon authority of which the justice entered the
stay. This ruling was made on the authority of Hickman v. Williams, ut supra.
Barnes v. Dick, 9 Yerg. 430, 433.
§ 3. Where the stayor gave the justice verbal direction to enter his name as a
stayor at a place one hundred and ﬁfty yards from the justice’s office, and in the
absence of the papers and record, this, it was thought, would exonerate the stayor,
on the ground 01' Hickman v. Williams, ut supra; but the question did not direct
§ 1y arise. Rcarns v. Mchlail, 9 Humph. 542, 544. And the reverse is now held. See
the cases cited next below.
§ 4. That the presence of the stayor before the justice at i/ta time his name is
entered is not necessary to bind him; that if he acknowledged himself stuyor in
the prrsmre of the justice, at his Qﬂice, and was accepted by thejustice as such, that
was sufficient, although subsequently, and after the stayor had leﬂ, the justice
made the entry on his docket. Ilennegnr v. Mee, 4 Sneed, 38, 35, overruling the
contrary dirtum in Hickman v. Williams, liinrt. a Yerg. 116, 118.
§ 5. That where the person desiring to become stayor acknowledged himselfsuch,
and was accepted as such by thejustice, at a place in the justice's county, other
ihan the jualice‘s ojﬁce or residence, and the justice on, returning home entered
the stay, this is sulﬁcient to bind him as stayor; for the justice's oﬂice is, for the
purpose ofany particular official act, wherever in his county the act is performed.

Morgan v. Coleman, 3 Head, 852.

The same doctrine upon the same state offacts

is laid down in G-heatham v. Brien, 3 Head, 552, 554. These cases clearly over
rule Hiclcnan v. Williams, Mart. &Yerg. 116, above cited, where the stayor met
the Justice in town, ﬁve miles from the justice’s residence, and told him to enter
his name, which the justice on returning home did on the same day; and Caper
ton, v. Gray, 4 Yerg. 563, where the stayor rode up to the justices’s gate and re
quested tllejustice to enter his name as stayor, which the justice on returning to
his house, did ; and also the dictum in Beams v. Nail, above cited.
§ 6. That where the original entering of the party's name as stnyor was void for
want of proper authority, the subsequent purol assent of the party to be bound
as stayor, made to the justice at a place two miles from his ollice, and after the

period agreed upon by thepm-ties for the stay had expired, is a nullity.
v. McLury, 3 Head, 159.

Mnyﬁeld

See Q 3060, and note.

The essence of the thing is the clearly manifested intention of the party on the
one hand to become bound as stayor, and the acceptance of him as such by the
justice. Carmichael v. Hawkins, 2 Sneed, 405. Thus where the stnyor within two

days, in the absence oflhe justice, wrote his name on the docket as stay, with the
intention to become bound as such, and the justice afterwards saw it, and accept

ed it, within the time allowed for entering stay, the smyor was bound. lb.

But

in such .1 case, wyere the justice never saw and approved it, until the eight months

had expired, and application was made for execution, it was not binding.

Davis v. Tyree, 9 Humph. 473. And though it is not necessary that the stayor should
formally sign the entr_r oti thejnstict<'s docket, still the acknowledgment of will
ingness to be bound as stay--r Ought to be made with as much solemnity as I. re
cognizance taken in open court. Patrick v. Driskill, 7 Yt-rg. 140,- 1_42.
_
Where the autltorizanlon isin w~iting.--Tiie stay of an execution in a proceeding

before a justice. is in efiect the confe.-sion ofa judgment, [see Q 3066, and note,]
and in strictness, a written nuthoiity to the jllSliL‘€ to enter the name ofan absent
individual as stnyor should possess, if not tht- fonnnl, at least the substantial re
quisites ofu letter or power of nttomey to cutilt-ss judgment_. Barr v. McGregor,
§ 11 Humph. 678. The t-stnblishcd and inﬂexible rule is that the written authority
to thejustice must upon its face, contain such u l(?f0I‘tD(.'C' tn, and description of

the judgment, the execution of Vl'lil(,'l\ l.-4 intended to be stayed, in some one or
more pat-tit~uln|-s, as without the aid of (‘4Xi|'lltk-‘l0 evidence, will render it reason!
bly certain that the judgment reftrrcd to in tlte writttm authority is the identical
judgment its to which the stn_\-oi-intendt-d to become surety. Ib.; quoted and ap

proved in Rhodes v. Chnppell, ll lltnnph. 527 ; in (‘nation v. Trail, l Head, 582, 584,
and in llolt v. Davis, 13 Ilﬁud, 629-30. Part-l evidence is admissible to t-id the
defective description in the written au1ho1izution.. ll ]['nnph. 520; Ib., 528; 1

Cold. 284.

Yet the in-iueti autborit_v niust. contain such rvfcrence to and descrip

tion ol‘ the judgment to be stayed as without ezt1'in--iccvidenre will render it rea
sonably certain that it is the jud;_'|nt-nt rt-|'eircd tn. ll llumph. 528; 1 _Head,
§ 284.—Purol evident-e can be of no avail to establish that ihc \\‘t'ltlt:ll authority
was intended to apply to 0. jutlgint-nt, to which the writing upon its face, in no one
certain and dialiilclitte particular, relates. 1 llead, 286. Thus, where two judg
ments were confessed by John P. Thonias, and W. R. Thomas in favor of B.
Barr, and the autl|uri7.ati0n ran as follows :—“1'1-q. Stark, Please enter my name
as stsyor to a judgment that B. Barr recovered before you, itgaitist John P. Thomas,
and oblige _vours”, etc.,—this was held instiiiicient. l-ct-unse
§ 1. The paper on its face referred to butone judt.-inent, and that a judgment

whereas the twojudgmeuts in question were rendered after the execution of the pn

§ 2. Thejudgment speciﬁed in the paper was one that B. Barr recovered against
John P. Thomas, not a judgmentaguinst John l’. Thomas and W. R. Thomas.
§ 3. The amount of the judgment was not stated.

§ 4. The paper did not upon its face rclnte to or describe eitherjudgment, and

And wht-re thejudgment was in favor of Robert Chnppell, administrator, etc.,
and against William H. Morris, N. Ward, J. P. Burton and P. O. Anderson, for a
speciﬁc sum, and the authorization ran :—“ Allen Goodwin, Esq., Sir, You are au
thorized to set n._v name duun as Bitl_\‘0l' to ti jitdpmt-nt git-en against Wm. H.
Morris and Nat Ward, on the 23d of Jun_v., 1849, in li.t\‘0l' of Robert Cltappell.

S. N. Rl|odc.~‘,"—tlllS was insnllicient, l)€t't1\l.~'(*-—
§ 1. It mentioned only the names of lu'o of the defendants.

But this on the

ground of Dillard v. Askew, 8 Humph. 586, woultl not of itself be ll fatal objec
tion.

§ 2. That it did not state the amount of tho judgment.

§ 11 Humph. 627-29.

And where there were sevenjudgments against the some defendants and in fl

Tor ofthc same plaintiffs, for upwards 0f_-/'om'lrmlul1|dI'Ptl dollars, and the written
direction ran—“ You will cuter my name as stay of execution on ﬁve judgments

that M0l‘;_'Bl'i {E Co. obtained before you on the 1.<t day of July ngninst‘\Vo0d 6: llsrt,
for some I‘l_f//tl or nine /uuulrul tlvllnrs, and costs of sr.it,“—this u-as ol' tt.~t-if in

sufficient to nutliorizc the justice to enter his name us stayor; but the party having taken as indemnity a deed in the nature of a mortgage, of land and personalty,
which recited his liability as stayor, he was eatopped from denying his liability by
the recitals in the deed. Morgan v. Cooper, 1 Head, 4-30.
And where the order to the justice ran thus :—“ Mr. G. W. Ruth, Esq., Set my
name down as stayor to two judgments that William Brown obtained against N.
Thompson, 3d, and William C. Holt, July 2d, 1857,"—this, the court said, was
suﬂicient; but the case turned mainly upon another point.

Holt v. Davis, 3

Head, 629.
If the order to enter stay is not suﬂiciently deﬁnite, the proceeding is ooidablc
at the instance of the proper party, but not void, and hence cannot be attacked
collaterally. 8 Head, 631.
But where the judgment was in favor of Letsy Cannon and against John M.
Wamer, as principal, and two others, as endorsers, and for $470 86, and costs
and the authorization ran:—“Mr. Galbreath, FAq., You may set my name as

stayor to a debt against John M. Warrior for about for hundred dollars, in fnvor
of Letsy Cannon, in the hands of C. A. Warner. F. Trail, [seal],”—t.his, aided
by extrinsic evidence, was suﬂicient. 1 Head, 282, 287. And whore the judg~
ment was for $62 50, in favor of T. A. Lancaster and against W. H. Alsup and
H. H. Alsup, and the letter addressed to the justice ran :—“ You may enter me as
stay of a judgment that T. A. Lancaster recovered against W. H. Alsup, on the
§ 19th of September for sixty-two dollars and ﬁﬂy cents, this 21st of September,
§ 1B40,”—this, corresponding with the name of the plaintif in the judgment, the
amount and date, and aided by proof that no other judgment was rendered against
William H. Alsup on that day, was suﬂiciently certain. Dillard v. Askew, 3
Humph. 536. The fact that the judgment was also against H. H. Alsup did not
vitiate the proceeding; for Oﬂcparly to a judgmenl may stay it. Ib. This last
position was re-aﬁrmed in Cannon v. Trail, 1 Head, 282, 286; butin Rhodes v.

Campbell, ll Humph. 528, it is said that Dillard v. Askew goes to the verge of
the law. The authorization need not be under seal. Patrick v. Driskill, 7 Yerg.

A garnishee may stay execution. Q 8096.

§ 3060. The security for the stay may, with the consent of At any tlmc.
the plaintiff, be received and entered by the Justice at any
time before the debt is paid. [Act_1841-2, ch. 136, § 4.]
Before the Act of 1841-2, ch. 136, it was held that with the expiration of the
two days the jurisdiction of the justice over the proceeding expired, so that a stay
entered after the expiration of that time would be void, and the stayor not bound.

But under the Act of 1841-2, ch. 186, the stay could be entered at any time be
fore the judgment was paid or execution issued. Talliaferro v. Herring, 10 Humph.
§ 272, 274 ; Cannon v. Trail, 1 Head, 282, 286. But this statute only applies to
cases where no stay of execution had been previously received. Where security
has been once received, the justice’s jurisdiction is gone, and after the expiration
of the two days of the statute, an additional stay cannot be entered by consent of
the plaintiif, under this statute. Howard v. Brownlow, 4 Sneed, 548, 551. Except
under § 8065. Where the stay is entered after the two days, the consent of the
plaintiff, in the absence of proof to the contrary, will be presumed. 10 Humph
§ 274. And where the party went to the justico’s oﬂice, after the lapse of the two
days given by law for staying the execution, and in the absence of the justice,

wrote his name as stayor without the knowledge or consent of either the justice or plaintiffs in the judgment, he was held bound as stayor; for the subsequent assent
of the judgment creditor and of the justice, manifested by their acquiescence, was
as effectual to bind the stayor, as if their previous consent to the act had been ex
pressly given. Neil v. Beaumont, 8 Head, 627. But where the parties agreed that

the judgment might be stayed at any time within a week from its rendition, and
within that time the name of a person was entered without his written direction
by another person, and after the expiration of the week, the stayor met the justice
two miles from his oﬂice, and acknowledged himself bound as stayor, and the jus

tice accepted him as such, it was held—
l. That the entry of the person‘: name as stayor by mother person without his
written direction was a nullity.
§ 2. The subsequent acknowledgment of liability was also void ; for the time

agreed upon within which the judgment might be stayed had expired.
§ 3. That in such a case, the acknowledgment of liability where none such exists

will not bind the party making it.

Mayﬁeld v. McLary, 3 Head, 159.

An endorse

ment on the judgment signed by the plaintitf—“ This judgment is to be stayed
eight months, " is not a contract to waive execution for eight mouths, but merely
n direction to the justice to take the statutory stay. Clark v. Thomas, Browns
ville, 1868; cited in 4 King’s Dig., 11,161. The above section was intended to
obviate, in whole orin part, the cases of Roberts v. Gross, 1 Sneed, 233 ; Howard
v. Brownlow, 4 Sneed, 548, and Apperson v. Smith, 5 Sneed, 378, in which it was
held that n continual stay, variant from the general law, and made after the expir
ation of the two days allowed for staying, or after the issuance of an execution,
or for part of the debt only, or for ashorter time than that allowed by law, or in a
mode diﬂ'erent from that prescribed, was nugatory and inoperative. Dictum in
Bothchilds v. Forbes, 2 Heisk. 13, 16. This dictum does not seem to be support
. ed by any of the other ca.ses.—Eds. See note preceding section, and note to §

§ 3061. It is not_ lawful for the Justice to enter security for
Y the stay of execution for any defendant bound as surety or en"
dorser on the original debt, where the security is oﬂered by the
principal, unless the defendant assents in proper person or by
writing, signed by him, and showing that the stayor is entered
as such at his instance and request.
[Ib., § 2, modifying 1820, ch.

But surety
must assent, if
stay oﬁerd b
principal.

See Q 1973, 8067, and 4171.

The object of this statute is to protect the surety

or endorser, where the debt is stayed, from the probable consequences of delay
in the collection of thejudgment, where such delay was occasioned without his con
sent or procurement, and to save him from the liability of eight months additional
interest, and the intermediate liability of the insolvency of his principal. Sten
nett v. Crookshank, 1 Hcisk. 496, 500. Under the original Act of 1820, it was
held that the surety who wished to show his dissent to the stay of execution must
appear and enter his dissent before the justice; a notice to the oﬁicer serving the
warrant would not be sufﬁcient. Elder v. Johnston, Peck, 204. The Act of
§ 1841-2, ch. 136, changed this rule ; and now the justice has no power to receive

security for the stay, so far as regards the surety or endoraer, without his express
assent manifested in one or the other of the modes pointed out in the above see
tiou, and he should state speciﬁcally on his docket how the fact was. The failure

of the justice to do so, however, will not prevent the surety or endorser from
showing by extrinsic evidence, that the execution was stayed at the instance of the
principal debtor, without his assent or request.
§ 84; Chaﬁin v. Campbell, 4 Sneed, 184, cited under next section; as was done in
this case, and in the case in 1 Heiskell above quoted. And where neither the
judgment nor the execution showed the order of liability of the defendants, it was
error to hold that they were all equally liable with respect to the provisions of
this statute—such a case not being governed by the provisions of {Q 8028-3031.
§ 1 Cold. 83 ; 4 Sneed, 1S4 ; White v. Brown, 4 Humph. 292, 297. Thus, if an ex
ecution issue against one of the sureties, after the expiration of the stay, he may
supersede it, and have an issue to try the fact of the suretyship. 4 Humph. 297:
And it is the stayor’s business to inquire into the relation of he parties to a judg
ment; for if any of those who do notjoiu in procuring the stay are sureties, the
stayor, in the event he is compelled to pay the debt, will have no recourse against
them. 4 Humph. 297-8. Where the stayor was brought before the justice by
the surety, and the justice hesitated to accept him, and the surety thereupon

vouched. his solvency, and after his name was entered said, “ that lets me out, "
and the justice swore that he entered the stay at the request of the surety, this was
conoiusive that the surety assented to the stay; although the stayor had certiﬁed
that he did not become such at the request of the surety. 1 Heisk. 496, 502.

§ 3062. The stayor who becomes security at the instance 0fs

the principal in the judgment, shall be ﬁrst liable, in default b°r°'° ""°"'
of the principal, before the original surety or endorser.

[1b.,§1; 1825, ch. s2, § 1.]
Hence, if a surety in the original judgment—the stay being entered without his
consent—pay the judgment, he may recover the money so paid in an action
against the stayor. Holt v. Davis, 3 Head, 629, 631; recognized in Chatﬁn v.
Campbell, 4 Sneed, 184, 191.

This on the principle that the surety who pays tho

debt without being liable to do so, is entitled to be subrogated to the plaintiﬁ"s
rights against the stayor, as in case of bail. 4 Sneed, 191.

v. Beardin, 10 Humph. 247.

And see Winchester

And the fact that the original judgment does not

recite the relation of principal and surety, does not prevent the latter from show
ing his true relation in any subsequent independent proceeding, instituted either

in his behalf or against him. The doctrine laid down in Grissom v. Moore, 1
Sneed, 861, applies only to Ike right of the plaintif in the judgmmt, and of the
collecting qﬂcer, to treat all defendants as principals, unless their true relation is
recited in the judgment. Ib., 191-2. See Q3031; note to preceding section
But when the stayor, who becomes such at instance of principal defendant, and
- without the assent of the surety, pays the debt, he cannot have an action against
the surety to recover the amount so paid: the surety paying the debt would have

an action against him. 4 Sneed, 184-191.

A case where both the sureties in the

judgment stay the debt, is not within this statute. In such a case, where the
judgment is stayed at the instance of one of the defendants, and without the per
mission of the other, the stayor is liable only in the event of the failure of both
the defendants to satisfy the execution. Sharp v. Embry, 1 Swan, 254.

§ 3063, Upon application of the stayor by aiﬁdavit in writ- Execution may
Issue at the

ing, to be ﬁled with the papers, that he is fearful, and believes },',';§*,;';f° of
that, if execution is further stayed, he will be compelled to

pay the judgment,.the Justice shall issue execution at any time
against the debtor and stayor.

[Act 1835, ch. 41, § 2.]

The affidavit must be ﬁled with the justice; the principal debtor cannot waive
it. Ellis v. Bivens, 4 Sneed, 146.

An ayreement for delay between the plaintilf and principal debtor, will not discharge the staycrr unless it is sup\ported by a valid consideration.

Thus, where

the stay had expired, and the creditor on the payment of part of the judgment,
and the promise to pay more, agreed to indulge the principal debtor, this did not
discharge the stayor; for the agreement gave the creditor no better or addi

tional remedy for the collection of his debt. Sharp. v. Fagan, 3 Sneed, 541. To
operate as a discharge tothe stayor, the agreement must be binding on the partiw,
and such as the courts can enforce. Ib., 543.

§ 3064. The debtor shall have two days after the levy of the

may yzlre other
execution to give other security for the unexpired time of the
stay, which, if received, and entered by the Justice, shall

operate a release of the former stayor, and also as a discharge
of the levy. [Ib., § 2, proviso.]
Plnlntlﬂma
§ 3065. If the plaintiff deems his debt in danger of being
have exeeut on
gglsgléuvltand lost on account of the insolvency, removal, or insnﬁiciency of
a stayor, he may, at any time, make oath of that fact before
the Justice having possession of the papers in the cause, and,
upon giving the defendant two day’s written notice of the time
of his application, require the defendant to justify, or give
other security; and, if the defendant fail to justify, or to give
other security to the satisfaction of the Justice, execution shall
issue forthwith. [Act 1845-6, ch. 46, § 2.]
This section and 5 3063, are to be construed together; and construing them

together, and in view of the other provisions of this Article~it is held-—
§ 1. That the proceeding by the plaintiff to have the security for the stay justi
fied, or new security given, does not exonerate the original security.
§ 2. That in caseof the failure of the defendant to juetify his security, or give new
security, the issuance of execution against the stayor is not postponed until the

expiration of the eight months, but the plaintiff is entitled to an immediate execu
tion against the principal defendant and the stag/m’. The liability of the stayor is
assumed in view ofthe existing law ,' and the issuance of an execution before the
end of the eight months, in a case provided for by law, is not a violation of the
contract, but in conformity with it. Rothchilds v. Forbes, 2 Heisk. 13.
The object of requiring aﬂidavit is, that the defendant who has already complied

with the requirements of the law, shall not be causelessly or whimiscally put to '
the trouble of hunting up other sureties, or showing that those already given arc
sutlicient, unless the plaintiﬁ will swear, and ﬁle his affidavit, that he believes his
debt is unsafe. This provision is entirely for the beneﬁt of the defendant. If _
‘ the plaintiff should issue execution without complying with this requirement, it
could be superseded as illegal ; but where the defendant comes forward and gives
the additional stay, without the aﬂidavit having been made, he is held to have
waived the same and the additional stayor is bound. Gaw v. Rawley, 8 Head, 716.

§ 11""! °“"*Y-

§ 3060. The entry of the stay on the Justice’s docket, under
the provisions of the foregoing sections, is a snﬁicient authority
to the Justice to issue execution against the defendants to the
judgment, and the stayors at the proper time.

[Act 1835, ch. 41, § 1.]
The legal effect of the act of becoming stayor, is equivalent to a confession of

judgment. Hickman v. Williams, Mart. &Yerg. 116; Roberts v. Cross, 1 Sneed,

$.38; Beams v. llcNail, 5Humph. 542, 544 ; Barr v. McGregor, 11 Hnmph. 518
§ 19; Hennegar v. lee, 4 Sneed, 33; Anderson v. Kimbrough, 5 Cold. 260, 262;
Noel v. Scoby, 2 Heisk. 20, 27, and other cases.

The result ofthis doctrine, so far

as regards the time, place and radium‘ of acknowledging the liability or entering
the stay, or the certainty required where the authorization is in writing, in order
to bind the stayor, is stated in the notes to § § 3059, and 8060. It also results
that, upon the expiration of the statutory period, the proceeding has the effect of
n judgment against the stayor, and cannot be attacked collaterally. 3 Head, 630;
§ 5 Cold. 262; 2 Heisk. 28. It operates after the expiration of the stay as a joint

judgment against the principal defendant and the stayor; and hence, if the prin
cipnl debtor die before satisfaction, the plaintiﬁ‘ may have execution against the
stayor, and satisfaction out of his property, without reviving against the represen
tatives of the principal defendant. Cabines v. Garrett, 1 Yerg. 491; Cheatharn
v. Brien, 3 Head, 553, 555. But the execution, inform, should follow the judg

ment, and run against both the principal and stayor. 1 Yerg. 491. If the oﬂicer
levies upon the property of the stnyor, without ﬁrst exhausting the property of the
principal defendant, the remedy of the stnyor is by cc:-tiorari and cupzraedea-1,
[Q5 2123, 2124 ;] but he is not entitled to this remedy, unless alevy upon his prop

erty has actually been made.

[Ib., § 3.]

By staying an execrition, the relation of principal and surety is contracted be
tween the principal defendant and stayor; and this statute confers on the justice

taking the stay, the power to render judgment in this summary way in favor of
the surety against the principal. Frost v. Rucker, 4 Hnmph. 57. By the original
act this summary jurisdiction in favor of a stayor, was given only to the justice

having charge of the papers; it could not be exercised by the Circuit Court. Ib.

§ 3073. Any Justice of the Peace in this State, upon the gggirir3;¢:nu_
production of an execution from a Justice’s judgment in an- °l11s=¢°""W
other county, accompanied by the certiﬁcate of the Clerk 0f_

the County Court of that county, that the Justice by whom
-the judgment was rendered and the execution issued, was at

the time an acting Justice of the Peace of his county, may is
sue an execution for the original judgment and costs, and the

cost of the certiﬁcate, which execution may be levied upon
any property of the defendant in said county, real or personal,
in the same way as if the judgment had been originally ren
dered in that county.

[Act 1805, ch. es, § 4; 1s51--2, ch. 181, § 3.]
This section incorporates the Act of 1851-2, ch.' 181, § 3, which enlarges the,
original Act of 1805, which extended only to executions “against the body, or
goods and chattels of any person who might remove himself‘, or goods and chaliels
to any other county in the State, ” etc., and repeals the rule laid down in Morgan
v. Hannah, 11 Humph. 122, that the levy and sale of realty under ajustice’s exe
cution certiﬁed from another county, is void. This statute enacts a new and spe
cial jurisdiction, which must be strictly pursued in order to make valid the pro
ceedings under it, and there are no presumptions in favor of it. Gibbs v. Bour
land, 6 Yerg. 481; Colville v. Neal, 2 Swan, 89; Eason v. Cummins, ll Humph.
§ 210. Hence, unless the execution coming from another county is certiﬁed accord
ing to the statute, the execution grounded on it is a mere nullity. 6 Yerg. 482.
S0, where the clerk's certiﬁcate was substantially defective in omitting to state
that the justice rendering the judgment was “ an acting Justice of the Peace of
said county ” at the time of the rendition of the judgment, the execution founded
upon it is simply void, and no protection to the ollicer acting under it. 11 Humph.
§ 210-11 ; Apperson v. Smith, 5 Sneed, 872. But where the clerk’s certiﬁcate did

not show ofwhat court or county he was clerk, or for what county tliejustice
who issued the certiﬁed execution was acting, the execution issued in pursuance
of the execution so certiﬁed, was voidable only, but not void. Stevenson v.
McLean, 5 Humph. 332. The execution which issued upon an execution certiﬁed
from another county under the statute, must also recite all the facts necessary to
show the special jurisdiction on which it is founded. 6 Yerg. 482-3; 2 Swan,
§ 90-91. Thus, an execution under the statute, which recited ajudgment in another county, but made no reference to a certiﬁed execution, was void. Ib. ; 6 Ycrg.
§ 482-3. An execution issuing under this statute, which does not set out all the cir
cumstances necessary to warrant its issuance, cannot be aided by parol or other
extrinsic evidence. 2 Swan, 91. If the justice to whom tho certiﬁed execution is
sent, mistakes his duty, and instead of issuing another execution in pursuance of

the same, renders a judgment thereon, and then issues execution, the judgment
so rendered, not being authorized by the statute, would be a nullity, but would
not vitiate execution issued in pursuance ofit, for the same execution would law
fully issue upon the certiﬁed execution. In such a case, the maxim, utile per
inutile non vitiatur applies. Perry v. Doyle, 9 Yerg. 18. Where an execution

coming from another county under the statute, has a credit endorsed on it, the
justice to whom it comes, may issue execution simply for the balance remaining
unsatisﬁed, and costs; and this is not irregular. Or, he may issue the execution

for the full amount of the judgment, and endorse the credit on the back of the
same. The former method accomplishes directly what the latter accomplishes
indirectly. 9 Yerg. 19. [Note.—This ruling is a modiﬁcation of the common law
rule laid down in Cahiness v. Garrett, 1 Yerg. 491, and followed in onc or two
other cases, that an execution must, on its face, be moulded in strict conformity
with the judgment,—a doctrine which seems to be founded in technicality rather
than in sense. Thus, Cabiness v. Garrett, followed iu Reams v. McNail, 9 Humph.
§ 542, 544, holds that where one of two or more joint defendants die after judg

ment, the plaintiff is entitled to satisfaction of the survivors, but the execution
is to he taken out against all the defendants jointly; “otherwise it will not

be warranted by the judgment. ”

Or, in other words, n writ is to issue, com

manding the sheriff to do precisely what he cannot do-—levy upon the property
ofa dead man. See note to Q 2997, p. 1287.-»Eds.]
Form.—As none of our books contain a form of a justice’s execution under the
above statute, the following is suggested :——
State of Tennessee,

h To any Lawful Oﬁicer—Greetiug:
County.
Whereas, on the
day of
§ 18 , in the county of [Tipton] and State
of Tennessee, before 'A. B., an acting Justice of the Peace of said county of [Tip
ton,] a judgment was rendered in favor of C. D., and agaiuts E. F., for
dol
lars and
cents, and costs of suit; and whereas an execution was issued
thereon, for
dollars and
cents, on the
day of
§ 18 , by the
said A. B., [or by G. H., an acting Justice of the Peace of the said county ofTipton,
having lawful custody of the papers in said cause,] which execution has come into
my hands in pursuance of Q 3073 of the Code of Tennessee, accompanied by the
certiﬁcate of J. K., Clerk of the County Court of said county of [Tipton,] that
said A. B., was, at the time of the rendition of saidjudgment, an acting Justice of
the Peace of said county of [Tipton,] and that the said A. B., [or G. B.,] was at
the time of the issuance of said execution an acting Justice of the Peace of said
county of [Tipton]:
You are therefore commanded that of the goods and chattels, lands and teno
ments of the said E. F., you cause to be made the aforesaid sum of
dollars
and
cents, together with lawful interest thereon, and also the costs hereon
endorsed ; and that you make due return of this writ.

If the érecution is also against a stayor, that fact should be recited, as in other

cases.

§ 13 0an 0

If a credit is endorsed on the execution certiﬁed from the other county, it may be stated on the face of the execution, and the oﬂicer commanded to make
the amount remaining unsatisﬁed ; or [what is the usual practice,] the execution,
on its face, commands the oﬂice to make the full amount, and the credit is en
dorsed on the back. 9 Yerg. 19. If the execution is levied upon land, the oﬂicer

returns it to the justice, with the levy set out in his return; and the justice, in
pursuance of the following section, returns it, with the original execution and oer.
iiﬁcate, to the Clerk of the Circuit Court, where it is docketed on the Reference
Docket, and unless cause appear why it should not be done, the land is condemned
under Q4} 8080, 5081.—Eds.
As to when a justice‘s exécution is to be returned, see Q 8024.

This section makes an exception to Q 3082, and thereby obviates the diﬁiculty sug
gested in Morgan v. Hannah, ll Humph. 122, 125, where it was said that the provi
sions of the Act of 1840, ch. 161, Q 1, [Q 8082,] requiring the original papers to be

Before the

above statute, where an execution from a justice and one from a court of rocord,

§ 3080. When an execution issued by a Justice of the Peace
is levied on real estate, it sh-all be the duty of the Justice to
whom the same is returned, to return the execution, together

§ 3087. The oﬂicer in whose hands is an unsatisﬁed execu

issued, or before the Justice of the Peace to whom the,_execu
tion is returnable, as the case may be, and answer the garnish
ment. [Act 1803, ch. 6, § 3; 1811, ch. 89; 1815, ch. 20.]
The proceeding by garnishment is in the nature of a sequestration of the effects
of the debtor, and may be resorted to by any tribunal to the extent of its execution
process. Thus, 0. Justice of the Peace has power to sequestrate the debts of the
defendant by garnishment to the extent of the judgment. Cheairs v. Staten, 3
Humph. 101. The clerk of the Circuit Court has no power to issue the writ of
garnishment. It must be a written notice by the oilicer who has the execution
in his hands against a party who has no goods on which to levy, [Q 8101,] ad
dressed to the garnishee, requiring him to appear before the court to which the

execution is returnable. Hogshead v. Carruth, 6 Yerg. 227, 280. -No judgment

With the exception created by this section, the rule established in this State by
many cases is that the answer is conclusive. Moore v. Green, 4 Hnmph. 299;
Huﬂ‘ v. Mills, 'l Yerg. 42; Drane v. McGavock, 7 Hnmph. 132-3; Brown v. State,

Hnmph. 328. Hence, the answer of one garnishee cannot be connected with that
of another, so as to make him liable. 4 Hnmph. 300. If the answer is imperfect,
it may be amended on interrogatories, which the court will compel the garnishee
to answer. If he does not know whether he is indebted or not, he must be dis
charged. If he answer falsely, then there is an end of it, except in a prosecution
for perjury. Ib., 301. If the answer is not sufficiently speciﬁc to charge him, he
must be discharged : a suspicion of fraud will not charge him. '1 Hnmph. 112. But
A suspicion of fraud may charge him with the costs. Q 3402. His liability is not
arrived at by surmises or inferences, but by direct admissions in his answer, or
conclusions necessarily following from them. Moses v. Mchlullen, 4 Cold. 242,
§ 245. As where the garuishes had executed a note to the defendant debtor which
he had given to another person, and did not know who held it. 9 Yerg. 412. In

is indebted to the defendant, or has in his hands p1-opertg/,de6ts or eﬂ'eeta, Abe

longing to him. 4 Cold. 244-5.

It is the duty of the garnishee to state in his

answer every fact within his knowledge, which had destroyed the relation of debt
or and creditor previously existing between him and the defendant. If he fail to

disclose a fact which, if disclosed, could have prevented a judgment against him,
he cannot afterwards set up that judgment in bar of a recovery on the debt he

owed the defendant, and which he knew had passed into the hands of a third per
son before he answered as garnishee.

A failure to make the proper defense is at

his peril; and a judgment in suchacase is the same aspayment toastranger.

Nor can he insist upon matter for the defendant debtor-- as a defense, which
would be good only in abatement of the attachment. Cheatham v. Trotter, Peck_
§ 198, 201. If a party is entitled to have an execution against himself quashed, he

may have a superseded: to quash an execution issued against his debtor as gar.
nishec ; for the garnishee has no interest in tho matter ; the judgment is a protec
tion to him, [Q 3493.] Baldwin v. Campbell, 8 Humph. 132, 139. But it was

not appeal from a judgment rendered against his debtor as garuishee. Atnip v.

§ 3115. The court may order publication for non-resident
defendants, who have no known attorney in the State, and

may prescribe rules for the assignment of errors, making issues
thereon, and for all such other matters as are necessary to give
full eﬂ'et:t to this proceeding.
The mode of procedure is thus indicated :
§ 1. To state by petition the facts on which the relief is sought.
§ 2. To give notice to the defendant, [} 3113;] or a superaeda'u alone may be
granted upon an ex parte application without notice.
§ 8. The plaintiff in error to ﬁle an assignment of errors, stating the errors in
fact relied on.
§ 4. To this the defendant in error may plead or dcmur; the common plea is in
nulla ed erratum, which, like a. demurrer, admits the facts alleg-"ed. [Goo.iwin

v. Saunders, 9 Yr-rg. 91.]
§ 5. The pleadings proceed as in other cases, and if an issue is reached, it must
be tried by a jury.
§ 6. The judgment, if for the plaintiff in error, is that the former judgment be re
called, revoked and annulled ; if for the defendant, that it be aflirlued. Craw

ford v. Williams, 1 Swan, 841-3.

The damages on aﬂirmance are regulated by

Q 3114.
§ 3ll6. The relief embraced in this article is conﬁned to er
rors of fact occurring in proceedings of which the per.-"on seek
ing relief hashad no notice, or which he was prevented by
disability from showing or correcting, or in which he was pre
vented from making defence by surprise, accident, mistake,
or fraud, without fault on his part.
This and the following section seem to have been drawn from the dicta of
Crawford v. Williams, l Swan, 341, our le-tding case on this subject. This is the
appropriate proceeding where there has been a recovery b_\‘ motion without no~
tice, against :tn oﬁicer and his surt-ties. Wyntte v. Governor, 1 Yerg. 149; ci
ted approvingly in Crawford v. Willittms, l Swan, 341, 346. It is the appmpri.
ate and only remedy, where a judgment has been obtained against a co-suret_\',
without notice, appearance or defense, after the claim was barred by the statute
of limitations. Merritt v. Parks, 6 Humph. 332; cited approvingly in 1 Swan,
§ 846. And so where a judgment has been given by motion, trithout notice, on a
bond not executed in conformity with the statute giving the motion. Goodwin v.
Saunders, 9 Ycrg. 92; cited approringly in 1 Swan, 346. But irregularities
itt the conduct ofa jury cannot be assigned as error in fact. United States V.
Gillis, 1 Pet. C. G. 169. Nor that the clntrge of the court was drawn up by one
of the counsel in the case. Selin v. Snyder, ll Serg. 8t R. 319. Nor that the
court declined answering a question on a point of law put by a juror. Krider v.
Lafferty, 1 Wheat. 803. Nor can anything be assigned as error in fact which ap

peared and was adjudged in the former suit.

Witmore v. Plant-, 5 Conn. 5-ll.

Nor anything which contradicts the record ofa former suit. 3 Bac. Ab., Error,
K., 8; State v. Disney, 5 Sneed, 698. Or impr~acl'es an oiﬁcer‘s return. Brown

v. Shepard, us., cited below. would have prevented the rendition of tl-e judgment if it hud jndicinfly appeared
at ll1\.- Lrlul. 1 Swan, 345-6; Biglnun v. Brewer, 4 Sneed, 432, 435 ; Pitteraon v,
Sharer, 4 Cold. 364, 367; 'l.'ibl)s, v. Anderson, 1 Thomp. Cali. 264, 268. And the
above seclion of the Code does not ‘restrict but enlarges this rule. 4 Cold. 357;
§ 1 Thomp. Caa. 268. Newly discovered evidence is not a. ground for this relief.
§ 4Sneed, 436; 1 Thomp. Cus. 270. Nor in an action of trespass, the fact thnt a
nolle prosequi had been entered alter jury called, as to one 01' the joint defendants,
from whom the plaintiif had received compensation in lieu of damages, when it
was too lute to plead accord and satisfaction. 1 Thomp. Gus. 267-9. Nor the
discover-_v slnll-2 the trial, of the ihct that the plnintilf had received from one of

the joint defendants a sum of money in lieu of dnmngcs. Ib.

Nor the fuct that

two other cases were consolidated Wllh the one in judgment, and tried before the
some jl1|'_\' at the same time; but this is a. very loose, irregular and dangerous
pmctir-e, and is to be discouraged. Ib., 267, 270. Nor the fact that the defend
ant was not an absconding debtor, but a non-resident at the time the attachment
was sued out against him. 4 Cold. 367. In such case the remedy is under {Q
§ 8529, 3530. \Vhere there was a judgment before a justice in 1860, appealed by
- plaintiti‘, failure to give appeal bond, or to have the papers carried up, or to enter
the cause on the docket, or to prosecute the appeal, until 1868, and judgment was
‘then tuken without the knowledge of the defendant, the defendant was entitled
to this relief, and could not have relief in equity. Green v. Neal, 2 Heisk. 318.

This proceeding will not lie to correct an error of fact arising from want of ser
vice of process, when.the otﬁcer’s return shows that there was service: an oﬂicer‘s
return cannot be averred against in this proceeding. Shepard v. Brown, Browns
ville, 1868; cited in 2 King Dig., Q 5670. Where the parties were all represented
by counsel at the trial, who yielded their assent without objection to the mode in
which it was conducted, took no exceptions to the action of the court, nor moved
for a nc\v trial, they cannot re-open the proceeding by this remedy. 1 Thomp.

Cas. 271.

The party seeking to avail himself of this remedy must show that it

was owing to no negligence on his part, that the fact concerning which the error
complained of is alleged to have been committed, was not made to appear at the
former trial; for if, by the exercise of all reasonable care and diligence he could
have availed himself of the fact on the former trial, then this remedy should be
denied him.

§ 3117. Thus, infancy at the rendition of the jud'gmen t, not Examples
appeuring on the record sought to be corrected, or a real de

made tlici-ef.»r, except within three years from the time of pro
nouncing the decree; saving to infants, married women, per
sons of unsound mind, imprisoned, or beyond the limits of
Dllbﬂllb

the United States, a right to a bill of review within three
years after such disability has been removed.

[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 53.]
That is, three ye.-irs after ﬁnnl decree settling the rights of the parties. Allen v.
Bnrksdnle, 1 Head, 238. The hill must show that the time of the statute has not
elapsed. Anderson v. Bunk 0l'T0nne.<S('8, 5 Sneed, 66l, 664.
l’¢'!‘-‘ions umlzr disability need not wait uniil the ihsnhility is removed. They
may Pl‘n>‘8L'll[8 n bill ol' review by next friend while the disability lasts. Winchel
ter v. Wircliester, l llearl, 460, 483. Where the above section rends “right to
a bill of review, " the original act rend, “ right to move for a bill of review."
The change of’ phrnseology was evidently made to conform to the construction
given the originil act in Winchester v. Winchester, 1 Head, 460, 481, namely, that
the right to a bill of review in case 01' persons under disability after the three
years of the suunie, exists to the same extent as before the three yeaus have expired,
and that in such cusc, where the errors complained of are apparent on the record,
the party is not compelled I0 move the Chancellor for leave to ﬁle the bill; and
that the Chancellor is without discretion to refuse leave to ﬁle a bill of review ,
for “errors apparent, " under such circumstances, the same as in other cases.

This snitute does not apply to u bill which seeks to impeach and set aside a
proceeding on the ground thnt. it is absolutely void. Goodman v. Tennessee Min
ing Co.. 1 llend, 172, 178. Nor would it apply to an original bill irnpcaching a
decree for fraud. See Frazer v. Sypcrt, 5 Sneed, 100, 103.
The cases (lL'l'l1'llllg the history, nature and scope oi‘ this remedy and the mods
ofprocrdure under it, do not involve an exposition of the above section, and be

§ 3l'3l. The depositions and exhibits that were read on the Depnsltlmlpltl
hearing of the cause, shall be considered a part of the record, ommm
as if the same were transcribed and incorporated with the de

crcc. [Act 1s35, Cll. 20, §15.]
Fee also 1 8108, and note.—'l‘his Statute introduces no new grounds for a bill
of review ; nor does it enlarge or modify the grounds of review luid down in the
ﬁrst of l§ncon’s Ordinances. Eaton v. Dickinson, 3 Sneed, 397.

§ 3l22. Not more than two new trials shall be granted to

the same party in an action at law, or upon the trinl by jury ‘"“"
of nu issue of fact in equity. [Act 1801, ch. 6, § 59.]
Tins section follows almost literally the language of the original act.—'l‘he
statute mcnns that where the facts of the case have been fairly left to the jury on
a proper charge of the court, and they have twice found n verdict for the same
party, each of which has been set alide by the court, ii‘ the same purty obtain an
-other verdict, in like manner, it shnll not be disturbed.

The nct did notintend to restrict the granting of new trials-—
l. For error in the charge of the court.
§ 2. l'0r error in adinitiing or rejecting testimony.
§ 8. For misconduct of thcjnry.

§ 4. And for other similar causes.

in E.-|.~‘t Ten|:. & Ga. R. R. C0. v. Hackney, 1 llead, 169, 171, where it is said to
be an exception to the letter of the stntute.—And where the record is silent as to
the grounds on uhich the Circuit Court acted in grunting the new trials, the Su
preme Court will presume that it was granted on the merits, and not for any oi’ the
above excepted cnuscs, and the party claiming the new trial must show the con
trary; and this he cannot do by proof nliunde: no other evidence than the recit

als of the record is admissible. 1 Humph. 19-20; 1 SWIIII, 78.

Hence, the proper

practice nndcr this statute is, to state in the entry of record granting the new
trini, the cause for which it is granted. Ib. The courts having made lll089 excep
-tions to the letter of the statute, will not make another, naniely: to meet a ruse
where new counts have been udded to the declaration since the granting of the
new trials. 1 Head, 1'i1. Where the last new trial had been granted in violation
of the statute, the Supreme Court set aside the verdict and judgment thereon, to
gether with the order granting the new triul, and gave judgment on the verdict
of the previous term. 1 Ilumph. ‘Z0.

the jurisdiction conferred, or is acting illegally, when, in the

judgment of the court, there is no other plain, speedy, or ade

Sup:1'xrd»a.9 alone.-—Ir. was said in Ednionsnn v. King, 1 Tenn. 425, 426, that 3
super»-uleas is generally auxiliary to n certior-nn'., yet no reason is perceived why it
may not issue as an original remedial writ, and that it could he grained by a single
judge in vacation as a remedial process; but it ought, however, to be granted as
it remedial process only in clear cases, where the irregularity appears evident. In

Mursh v. Haywood, 6 Humph. 210, 218, it is said that the simple and proper
remedy where an execution has been satisﬁed, and the pluintiﬂ‘ refuses to acknowl
edge satisﬂiction, is by motion. If in vacation and the execution is in the hands
of an olﬁeer for collection, n superaeclezu may be granted upon a proper applica

satisfaction entered. The power oi‘ the Judges to grant process of this nature is
declared in Q 3946.

See note to 1 3l23.—'I‘he constitutional provision on this subject does not ap
ply to criminal cases. Kendrick v. State, Cooke, 474, 477. But the constitutional

Miirfrce v. Looper, 1 Tenn. 1. But contra, see Wade v. Murry, 2 Sneed, 50, 56.
The griiiitiiig of the writ of carliorari is matter for discretion, but it is a discre
tion subject to be regulated by law. Bob v. State, 2 Yerg. 173, 179. Hence,
an appeal in the nature of ri. writ of error will lie from on order of the Circuit Court,
refusing to grunt this writ. Ib. ; Lawson v. Scott, 1 Yerg. 92.
In view ofthe enlarged jurisdiction of‘ justices, the remedy by an-tim-ari where

taiii an order for the issinnice of the writs, and when this is obtiiineil its ollice is

same petition contain n pi-uyer for several distinct writs, the petition ought not to
be dismissed for this cause. This is not a. inisjoinder; for the pi-tition is not a

leading process, but un aﬁidnrit hiying grounds for the leading process. lb. its

[Act 1817, ch. 119, § 2.]
Before the Code, it was hehl that where the certiorari was resorted to instead

oi the obsolete writ of audita guercla, upon matters arising subsequent tn the
judgment, and in which class of cases the judgment itself is not called in ques
tion or attacked, the jirlgrnent upon the procee hug was simply that the writ. be
q.|a.shed, or t..h-at a procedendo issue, and for costs. Kincaid v. Morris, 10 Yerg.
§ 252 ; Rogers v. Ferrell, Ib., 254, ‘Z56; Jones v. Williams, 2 Swan, 105. It was
held that the act from which the above section was drawn did not apply to the

cn'ti0rm'i when used as a substitute for audila. querela, and that where the de
fendant succeeded, he was not entitled to jud,-_rmc-at against the petitioner as l\i)OVB

provided. 10 Yr-rg. 252 ; Edde v. Guwan, I Sneed, 29", 296.

And to render such

a judgment was error. 1 Swan, 107. And the petitions-r’s surety was only lis
ble for the costs of the new proceeding. 1 Sneed, 296. And see Barnes v. Robin
son, 4 Yerg. 186; Kincaid v. Smith, 8 Yer_;. 217; Neil v. Beaumont, 3 Head, 627.
But this and the following section oi the Code change the rule, and where the do
fendunt succeed-', the revising court, in all cases, renders a new judgment against
the ]J€lillm|et' and his surelirs for the amount of‘ the recovery below, together
with the statutory damages, and all costs. Mailett v, Hutchinson, 1 Head, 558,

“ Any person."-Tluts, a gnrnishee may appeal. Q 8492, and note.—'l'he Act
of i794. ch. 1, Q 54, originally gave an appeal front ajustit-e‘s judgment. Under
that Act, the sppenl could not be tnken after the day of trial. Hayes v. Kirk,
§ 2 Tenn. 322. The Act of 1827, ch. 19, ii 2, 3, changed this rule, and allowed

the p-trty dissatisﬁed with the judgment “ two days ” in which to appeal.

It was

held that this “two days" meant two dnys exclusive of the day on which thejudg
ment was rendered. Carson v. Love, 8 Yerg. 215. And the Act of 1835, curried
into the Code in the above section, was worded in conformity with this ruling.-—

An nppeul granted after the expiration of two days from the dute of the judgment
will be distnissed on motion. Gilbert v. Driver, 3 Head, 363; Carver v. Jenkins,
§ 2 Heisk. 629, 682. Butif the appeal was prayed and grsnte-I within the time
prescribed by la\v, the mere fact that the appeal bond was executed afterwards, if
accepted and ﬁled by thejustice, will not vitinte the nppcnl. 2 Heisk. 629-634,

is tried dc notvo, on the merits, and is not to be revised on error, and the court
must proceed to renderjudgtnent on the merits, without reference to the defects
in thejudgment below. Allen v. \V00d, 1 Head, 436. And any defenses may be

III44. If the Justice fail to return the papers within the

same are returnable, and the appellant fail to appear and pros

.shall have judgment ﬁnal, by default, for the amount of the
judgment of the Justice, against the appellant and his sureties

for the debt and costs. if the plaintiff is the appellant, and
fails to appear within the term, his suit shall be dismissed, and

[Act 1s11, ch. 119, § 2.]
The Act of 1869, eh. 63, [Q1 3142, 3143,] was, in Humphrey v. Humphrey, 1_
Swan, 154, declared inconsistent with the Act of I801, carried into the above

section.

The former made the defendant liable for the justice‘; ue]/i_g'n.r:e in

failing to return the papers ; the latter made him liable for his own n-yligezwa in
failing to prosecute his appeal; and it was hehl that the former net, so far us it
authorized a dismissal of the nppeal for the failure to ﬁle the papers within the

ﬁrst two days of the term, [Q 3143.] was repealed by the latter. Both, however,
are retained in the Code. See Car. Lawsuit, Q 631; Heisk. Dig., p. 136, note.
Where the justice failed to ﬁle the papers \vithin thc ﬁrstvtwo days of the term,
but ﬁle:l thern during the term, it was accordingly held that the uppellee was not

for that reason entitled to an alﬁrmance of thejudgment. 1 Swan, 15-4.

But if the

papers were not returned at the ﬁrst term but were returned to the second term
after the appeal, the appellant would not be permitted to avail himself‘ of his ap
peal, but it would be dismissed on motion ; for it is the duty of the appellant to see
that the papers are returned at the right term, and if the justice fail so to return
them, he should apply for a certiorari. Pierce v. Pierce, 4 Sneed. 77.

Court is concurrent with the Circuit or Chancery Courts, or in
which both parties consent, the appeal lies direct to the Su

[Act 1855-6, ch. 116, § 5; 1813; ch. 78, § 2.]

See Qﬁ 3172, 8178.—From the Probate Court of Shelby County, an appeal lies

lie directly from the County Court to the Supreme (‘0urt:—

§ 1. Where the jurisdiction of the County County is concurrent with that of the
Circuit or Chancery Courts.
..
§ 2. Where the jurisdiction is not concurrent with that of the Circuit or Chan

This section modiﬁes the original Act only as to the time within which the

Judgment of
llﬂrmanoe.

§ 3l5l. If the transcript is not ﬁled within the time pre
scribed in the last section, or if the appellant shall fail to ap
pear, or to prosecute his appeal, the judgment, sentence, or
decree of the County Court shall be aﬁh-med. [Ib., § 66.]
By the old law the record was required to be ﬁled ﬁfteen days before the court
sat; and on Failure to ﬁle the record in time, it was the duty of' the clerk to put
the case on the reference docket, and it was alﬁrmed on motion. Duncan v. Mo
Gee, 7 Yerg. 103, 104; McDonald v. McAlistcr, 7 Yerg. 304. This section follows
without motliﬁcation the original act. The act makes a rule of positive law, which
cannot be departed from ; and although cases oi" great hardship have occurred in

the practice under it, yet in no case except where fraud had been practiced to pre
vent carrying up the record, has the court felt authorized to help the delinquent.
In all such cases, it must be taken that the appellant has abandoned the prosecu
tion oi‘ the appeal. '7 Yerg. 305: and see Stuart v. Pasmore, 5 Hayw. 30. The
provision is imperative, and mast be complied with, althouuli the judgment of the
County Courtis wrong. Gregory v. Burnett, 1 Humph. 60; 5 Hnyw. 30; Nichols
v. Colville, 1 Tenn. 81. But it is said the appellant may still have a writ of error
to reverse errors in the record. 5 llayw. 30. If the appellant fail to carry up
the record the eppellee may do so. Suggs v. Suggs, l Tenn. 2. But if the nppel
lant fail to prosecute his appeal, the appellee may carry upthe record wdrtin
twelve months ,' otherwise he cannot have an eiﬁrmance, for the judgment is dor
mant. Norwood v. Humphre_rs, 2 Tenn. 188. The appellee may, if the appellant
fail to prosecute his appeal, bring up the record and have the judgzmcnt alﬁrmed
during the second term after appeal prayed, without notice to the appellant.
Bustard v. Cheatham, 1 Tenn. 870. But it seems the rule is different in relation
to appeals to the Supreme Court; for in one ease it is hold that that court will not
apply any limit to the time within which the appellee may ﬁle a transcript, and
have thejudgmeut below aﬁirmetl.

Spalding v. Kincaid, 1 Thomp. Cas. 48.

And

in Turner v. Carter, 2 Sncetl, 1, 4, it is held that the lapse of three years from the

grant of the appeal furnishes u0 ground for refusing the appellee‘s motion to aﬁirm Lhe judgment, the appellant having failed to prosecute, nor could the appellant be
beard to urge lapse of time as a reason for refusing the appellee‘s motion. But
if the record is brought up by the appellee, and an aiﬁrmance of the judgment
moved I'or at any time after the term of the Supreme Court to which the record

ought to have been certiﬁed, notice of his intention to do so, ought to be given
to the appellant or his attorney. 2 Sneed, 4. And see note to Q 3185.
A motion to dismiss is a waiver by the appellee oi‘ his right to try at the ﬁrst
term ; but the appellant may, when the cause is called, insist upon his right to try
at that term, and the appellee, if not ready must continue as in other cases.
Patton v. Wright, 1 Tenn. 378. And on trial, cause for dismissal would be con
sidered by the court. Ib.
It is Slllll that the practice of the Supreme Court as a court of errors has not
been to consider n. motion to dismiss as a waiver of the right to try at the same
term. Ib., Ju lge Cooper’s note. Cooper’s Edition.

§ 3l52. On appeal, all jury cases in the County Court sl1al1;I;fIc_}rﬂef,,1:m

V. State, 2 Sneed, 2l5 ;2 5372; note to Q 5361.—Aud so it is on appeals from de~

cisions in reference to insolvent estates. Q 2336, and note. And so it is on ap
peals from an order condenminc laud for a mill site. Q 1914, and note. And so
it is in an appenl from an order condemning land for a public road. Patton v.
Clark, 9 Yerg. 268; § 1191, and note. The trial in road cases in the Circuit
Court is hy the court, and the court has no power to submit the case to a jury.
Evans v. Shields, 3 Head, 70, 74; Beard v. Justices, Ib., 97, 99. It is also said
that nn appeal from nu order of the County Court in road cases may operate as a
broad appeal, or an appeal in error, according to the nature of the case ; that on

the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court, the entire proceedings ure open to im
peachment upon their face, or upon proof‘, just us they were in the County Court;
and that if no extraneous evidence be oﬁl-red, and the proceedings be regular in
form and substance, the Circuit Court, whose jurisdiction is only appellate in such
cases, must, of necessity, revise the record as if it were belore it on a writ of
error, and not treat the proeeedingsin the County Court as vacated and annulled
by the appeal. Ib. And so it was held under the Act of 1794, ch. 1, Q 63, that
a party might uppcal from the county to the Superior Court on a determination
of a mere matter of law, and the attention of the Superior Court might only be call
ed to points of law, without theintervention of ajury. Ward v. Stewart, 2 Tenn.

'10.

And it is held that nu appeal to the Circuit Court from ll. decision oi‘ the County

Court on on inquisition of lunacy, can only operate as an appeal in error. (‘oop
er v. Summers, 1 Sneed, 453, 456. But where the cause was brought up by sim
ple nppeul. on issues of fact pending, it was erroneous to treat it usa writ of error,
and to look to errors committed before the issues were made up. The issues
should be tried in the Circuit Court, and the cause ended, on the merits. Roberts
V. Stewart, 1 Yerg. 390, 394. And so where there wns a simple appeal from a

j judgment on a verdict of eleven jurors, this could not be inquired into in the Cir
cuit Court, though it would have been otherwise on an appeal in error.

A simple appeal hnd merely the effect of a -new trial of the cause. McDonald v. Mo
Donuhl, 5 Ycrg. 307. [The fort-going C:IS1‘5 would seem to result in the rule on.
acted in the above section, that jury cases will, in the Circuit Court, be int-'Ps

shall immediately make a full and perfect copy of all the pro

givc the same, with a taxation of all costs accrued, to the ap

If the transcript is improperly or defeclively certiﬁed, no judgment cnu he ren

§ 5 Yerg. 443. The certiﬁcate must state that the transcript is a full and perfect
record ; a certiﬁcate that “ the foregoing is truly copied from the records on ﬁle
in my oﬁice,” is not suﬂicient. lb. Where the certiﬁcate ran, “in testimony
whereofl have hereunto set my hand and uﬂixed the seal of the nl‘ore.<aid court,"
etc., and the seul was actually aﬂixed, the omission of the signature was not fa

“ Give the same to the appellant, ” etc.—It. was held before the Code to be the
duty of the appellant, and not of the clerk, to transmit the record from the Cir

attorney of the appellant to trnnstnit ir, hut failed to do so, was not a sullicieut
reason to prevent. a dismissal of the appeal for failure to ﬁle the record. Porter

County Court to the Circuit Court. in Crafts v. Stockton, 8 Yerg. 164.

such case is, whether the judgment is valid as to the party who appeals. If valid

The absence of such an en try renders all subsequent proceedings void. H Humph.

§ 107. In one case it was held that where the record did not show that an appeal
was granted, the appellee might give the court jurisdiction by waiving the defect.
Ninney v. Damrou, 1 Tenn. 184. But this is clearly overruled by the above cases,
and Agee v. Dcment, 1 Humph. 382, and other cases, which hold that cnnsenl
cannot conferjurisdiction. And in another case it was hold that the appellant cannot take exceptions to the manner in which his own appeal is broughtup, and
cannot, therefore, move to dismiss his appeal on the ground that the record does
not show that the appeal was allowed or an appeal bond taken. Marr v. Bell, 1
Tenn. 368. But this case, so fur as it lays down a principle applicable to appeals
to the Supreme Court, also seems to be overruled by the cases which overrule,
Kinney v. Damron, and for the same reason. Judge Cooper thinks that if these
cases were appeals f01'r¢lrt'/zl, as seems most probable, the rulings may be sustain
ed on tho principle of Elkins v. Sams, 3 Hnyw. 44, which holds that consent of
parties, and their appearance and trial on the merits, will waire the irregular
ity of the transfer of the cause from the court in which it was instituted
to another court for trial, when the latter court would have had originaljurisdi0
tion of the action if it had been commenced there.—Thus, it has been held that
parties mny by consent, transfer a Cause from the County Court to the Circuit
Court for trial, where the cause is one which could hnve been brought in the Cir
cuit Court by 0ri;_'iual process. Chester v. Embree, Peck, 370. And so, in anoth

gncase it is held that where u defective bond has been given for appeal from the
County Court to the Circuit Court, the appellee may elect to consider the appeal
as properly taken, or to dismi.-s it on motion. Greer v. Williford, Peck, 290.
Until the Act of 1851-2, ch. 100, Q 3, [infra., Q 4178,] where there was no evi
dence of the grant of an appeal by u justice except the recitals of the appeal bond,
it was held that the appellate court had no jurisdiction. Rogers v. Hill, LYerg.,
§ 400; ll Ilumph. l07. Now see Q 4178, and note-—and note to Q 287l5.—-Wliero

Bond for appral.—The taking of the appeal bond is ajndicial act ofthe court.
Davis v. Dyer, 5 Sneed, 679 ; McAlister v. Scrice,7 Yerg. 277. And if the pauper

it is a nullity. 5 Sneed, 679. The tender of a sufficient bond is n prerequisite to
the gmnting of the nppenl. 7 Yerg. 278. Otherwise in npprals from Justices of
the Peace. McCur\'er v. Jenkins, 2 lloisk. 629. The bond is presumed to be taken
in the prcsenceofthe court and the parties. It is sulijeet to objections, and the mind
ofthe court may be called, not only to the form, but to the suﬂieiency ofthe bond
and of the securities oifered, or thnt the clerk in taking it violated his duly. It
follows that the clerk is not liable for takings. defective appeal bond. 7 Yeig. 278.
In actions at law, the bond must. be given during theterm, or it is anullity. Bay
ley v. llazurd, 3 Yerg. 487, 491; Blythe v. Peters, Ib., 378—9. And the court

be added. 2 Yerg. 83.—-Thus, a bond for the performance of the decree of the

Supreme Court, does not bind the surety for the costs of the court below.

Terry

Y. Stukely, 3 Yerg. 506.--A bond “well and truly to prosecute the appeal,"
omitting the words, “ with effect, ” wants all the essential requisites of the law,
and does not authorize anyjudgment whatever against the sureties. Jones_v.
Parsons, 8 Yerg. 321; All)t*.rt.~<0|| v. McGee, 7 Yerg. 106. It is only conditioned
to prosecute, which the principal does, though without eifect. 7 Yerg. 107. If
the bond describe the judgment as n. less amount than it actually is, the sureties
are not thereby discharged, but are bound for the amount of the judgment as
stated in the bond. Jenkins v. Skillern, 5 Yerg. ‘.288. And where the bond is
taken for less than double the amount of the judgment, but recites the case ac

curately in other respects, the sureties are not di.-ichurged for this defect. Ib.

But

where the bond did not show in whose favor thejudgmeut, was rendered, it was
held that nojudgment could be rendered against the sureties. Brown v. McLaugh

See Patrick v. Nelson, 2 Head, 507, cited under Q 3162.—So the bond and pro

Q 3184. As to proceedings in the appellate court, see ii 3184, 3151, and notes.
History and Qﬂice of appeal in error.—The appeal in the nature of awrit of error

was unknown to the common law, and was introduced into our system by the
Act of 1811. Banks v. Brown, 4 Yerg. 198. Before this act but two methods
existed by which one court could revise the proceedings of another on points of
law. Benton v. Englemau, Cooke, 496. As to the use of the certiorari, in cases
not reached by writ of error, see note to Q 2123 ; Q 2124, note (e.)

One of three methods may now be adopted for bringing a cause into the Eu
preme Court :—
§ 1. An appeal prayed in the court below, and granted.

§ 2. An appeal in the nature of a writ of error, prayed and granted in like man
ner.
§ 8. A writ 01' error; that is ﬁling the record in the Supreme Court, and assign
ing errors. Bell v. Brown, 5 Yerg. 107.
If a pnrty pray an appeal, when he should pray an appeal in error, on the ree
ord being ﬁled, the appellate court would regard the cause as being brought up

by appeal in error, or the record would be considered as ﬁled for writ of error.

Eject of.—A simple appeal from the County Court to the Circuit Court, brings
up the cause for trial anew ; and supersedes all errors below.

Errors committed below

So a simple appeal from the Chancery Court to the Supreme Court secures a
trial dc nova in the Supreme Court, the same as if it had originally commenced
there. Haskell v. Haskall, 3 Sneed, 208. Morris v. Richardson, 11 Humph.
§ 389, 392. And an error committed below will be disregarded if the ﬁnal decree be
correct. 11 Humph. 892. But on an appeal in error, the court of errors will re

view all material decisions in the cause.

Campbell v. Wallen, Hart. &Yerg. 266.

And a dismissal of the appeal leaves the decree below in the same condition as if
no appeal had been taken. Franklin v. Franklin, 2 Swan, 521 ; 3 Sneed, 209. But

it" a plainttj appeal from a justicc‘s judgment, and dismiss his appeal, he thereby
dismisses his suit. Dossett v. Miller, 8 Snccd, 72. A simple appeal aimuls thejudg
ment below.

Furber v. Carter, 2 Sneed, 1; Suggs v. Suggs, 1 Tenn. 2 ; Nichols v.

Colville, 1 Tenn. 81.

But an appeal in a-1-or, only suspends the judgment below

until ﬁnal judgment in the appellate court. Thomnson v. Kercheval, 10 Humph.
§ 322, 324; Furber v. Carter, 2 Sneed, 1; Ragsdale v. Statc, 2 Swan, 416, 419. But
this rule only extends to those matters embraced in the appeal. Gilchrist v. Can
non, 1 Cold. 681. And a party may pray an appeal from that part of the decree
only with which he is dissatisﬁed. Wood v. Cooper, 2 Heisk. 441, 455. If one
of the parties die pending a simple appeal this abates the suit, and not the appeal.
§ 3 Sneed, 208. But if an appeal in error be dismissed or abated, the judgment be
low remains in force. 10 Humph. 324. And sec note to Q 2846, p. 1198. If the
appellant fails to prosecute his appeal, the judgment below remains suspended,
and cannot operate until some action is taken in the appellate court. 2. Sneed, 1.

The aﬂreal in error operates in the same manner as a writ of error and super
udeas. 10 Humph. 824.

An appeal of either kind, upon the expiration of the term of the court from
which it is taken, transfers the cause to the appellate court, so that no order can
subsequently be made in the court below. Staggs v. State, 3 Humph. 372, 375 ;
Davis v. Jones, 8 Head, 608. But during the term, the appeal may be set aside, and
an amendment allowed. Hall v. Bcwley, 11 Humph. 106. And apleading ﬁled

pending the appeal, will not be regarded as ﬁled until the cause is remanded.
Decatur Bank v. Berry, 3 Humph. 590-1. And a bill of exceptions signed sub
sequent to the adjournment of the term is a nullity. Note to § 2968. But the
Supreme Court will, after the expiration of the term, award a mandamus to com

pel a judge to sign a bill of exceptions.

Sneed v.Hall, 8 Cold. 255.

And where

the appeal is defeated in any way, the Supreme Court will aid the injured party by
any writ which would overcome the injury. Ib.; King v. llampton, 3 Hayw. 59,
§ 60; Craddock v. Pritchett, Peck, 22.
§ 3176. A writ of error lies from the ﬁnal judgment of the
County Court, to the Circuit or Supreme Court, and from the
Circuit and Chancery Court to the Supreme Court, in all

cases where an appeal in the nature of a writ of error would
have lain.

the court, and the court refused to set it aside upon motion, a vrrit of error will

lie. Graham v. Green, 4 Hayw, 187. Where the judgment for the plaintiff in
the County Court was, upon writ of error, reversed in the Circuit Court, but Flui
out an order remanding the cause for trial do mruo, this was held eneh a ﬁnal

How o§tain¢l.—The Writ may be obtnined from the dork of the Supreme Court,
within one yea: after the judgment or decree sought to be reversed, l>ysimplyﬁl

bylaw. Spur-gin v. Spurgin, 3 Had, 23-4.—0r, the writ may begrarncdby orderof
the Supreme Court in term time, or by one of the Judges in vacation. Tb. And
the notice required by Q M83 must be given, which ever of these modes of suing
out the writ is pursued. lb. Sec § 3l83,'nnd note.—The prosecution of a simple
writ of error is as much n matter of right ns an appeal. 3 Head, 25. Under
our system,'the right to pursue either remedy, writ. of error or appeal, cannot be

questioned or gainsaid.

Where the applicaztion is made to the clerk of the Su

preme Court, he has no discretion to judge tftlie propriety of the application, or
to nefuscit. And this may, perhaps, be saidalso in respect tom application for
at writ of error merely, made to a single judge of the Supreme Court. Ib. Where
in addition to 0. writ. oferror a supcrsedeas is likewisedesirsd, there would bcmore
reason in allowing the adverse party nn opportunity of appearing bekme the
Judge to whom the application is made, to show cause against its issuance. Yet.
it cannot be supposed that it was contemplated by the Legislature, that the merits
ofthe case should be discussed and adjudged by u. single Judge at-chambers, upon
an application for a superscdcac. 3 Head, 25. It was said in onecase that the

writ issues of course, and that the court could take no action concerning it any
more than upon any other process issuing olf right out of the clerk’s oﬁoe.

ment, the defendant may supersede it, and obtain a. writ oferror; but if he omits
to ask for the writ of error, the supersedeaa will be discharged by operation of law
at the return term of it; and the defendant cannot have the advantage of a writ

years apply in the Circuit Court for a writ of error to the County Court.-Under

this $801101], and Q 8178, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof, may grant a writ
of error simply, without a supersedes; within two years from the rendition of the

judgment sought to be reversed.

Harben v. Congden, 1 Cold. 221.

§ 3182. Infants, married women, persons of unsound mind,§;y,§p§1rd1~

prosecute writs of error within the time prescribed after disa

§ 3188. If sued out after the term of the court at which the awe.

judgment complained of was rendered, ﬁve days’ notice in
writing shall be given to the adverse party of the intention to
apply for the writ. [Act 1794, ch. 1, § 37, modified]
By the original act, ten days’ notice.

The ﬁve days’ notice is waived by appearance.
§ 561.

McBee v. McBee, I Heisk. 558,
This provision and all the provisions of the Code in regard to prosecuting

writs of error to the Supreme Court, are but a re-enactment of the law as it pre
viously existed. Spurgin v. Spurgin, 8 Head, 23-4. A writ oi‘ error is regarded
in law as the bringing of a new suit, and like all other suits, may be commenced
by the party at his own peril, without notice to the adverse party. But as in all
other suits, the defendant must be notiﬁed of the pendency of the suit, and have s
day in court to make his defence ; and the ﬁve days’ notice, prescribed above, is

the process and mode deemed proper by the Legislature for bringing the defend
ant in error into the appellate court. Such is the intention of the above require
ment, and the proper construction to be given it. The effect is, that the defendant
is not to be considered in court until the service of such notice, nor can the case be

heard until after the expiration of ﬁve days from the time of service thereof‘, and
that thenotice need notnecessarily precede the application for the writ.

This pro

vision of the Code, is modiﬁed from the Act of 1794, ch. 1, § 37. But, although
the provision of the latter Act is more stringent in its terms than that re-‘enacted

by the Code, yet since the passage of the Act of 1811, ch. 72, E 12, a practice has
grown up silently, which had been sanctioned by this court, that it was suﬁicient
if notice had been issued by the clerk of the Supreme Court, afterﬁling the record
in his oﬁice.

And in view of this course of practice, and in accordance therewith,

we suppose the provision of the Code was adopted, and intended to be understood.

dismissed on the ground that the record was not brought up
within the time prescribed by the rules of the court, the appel
lant may, notwithstanding, prosecute a writ of error within
the same time, and under the same regulations, as if no appeal
in nature of writ of error had been taken in the case.
[Act 1827, ch. 50, § 1.]
See Craddock v. Pritchett, Peck, 22; Hoisk. Dig., Q 153. By the Act of 1829,
ch. 108, Q 2, the Supreme Court was forbidden to dismiss any writ of error upon

any rule of court, or for want ofan assignment of errors.

See Q 8160, and note.

The clause forbidding a dismissal upon any rule of court seems not expressly car
ried into the Code ; but the prohibition is embraced in Q 4516. See that section

and note.
As to the time when a motion to dismiss an appeal or writ of error must be
made in the Supreme Court, the cases do not seem to be in accord. In one case
the court said they would apply no limit as to the time within which the appellee
might ﬁle the transcript, and have thejudgment aﬁirmed. Spalding v. Kincaid, 1
Thomp. Cas. 48. In a later case, judgment of aﬂirmance on the appellc-e’s motion
was rendered after a lapse of these years. Furber v. Carter, 2 Sneed, 1. But the

present court say that a motion to dismiss a writ of en-or for failing to ﬁle the rec
ord, where the notice required by Q 3183 has been given, must be made at the
ﬁrst term ,' otherwise at the ﬁrst term after the defendant has notice. Gillespie
v. Goddard, 1 Heisk. 777, 779. But this rule would be relaxed upon good cause
shown for not making the motion at the ﬁrst term. Tedder v. Odom, 2 Heisk.
§ 50, 51. A motion to dismiss because the bond was not given until after the ex
piration oi the term allowed by the decree for giving the bond,which was not made

until the fourth term, was disallowed; and the reason assigned was that the plain

tiﬁ‘ after such alapse of time, could not, [under Q 8180, 3181,] ﬁle the record for
error. Ib..

§ 3186. If the judgment or decree below has been executed Does not men

of error is obtained and supersedeas granted, the right, title
and interest of any purchaser, previously acquired, under the

judgment or decree, shall not be disturbed or affected by the
reversal of such decree.

[Act 1835, ch. 20, § 16.]

The Supreme Courtwill revise the proceedings below ; for the plaintiﬂ’ in error
is entitled to this, and in so doing they will not enquire whether their action will
avail him anything, or affect the rights of a purchaser under the decree below.
McBee v. McBee, 1 Heisk. 558, 565. But where n. writ of error was prosecuted
by the defendant, after ﬁnal decree and sale, and the only error in the record was
that the chancellor had ordered the sale before the amount of the complainants’
debt had been ascertained by reference to the clerk and master, the Supreme
Court refused to reverse, on the ground that a reversal could be of no importance

to the plaintiff in error, since, under this statute, the purchaser's title could not
be affected, or a re-sale ordered.

Lewis v. Baker, 1 Head, 886, 388.
§ 3187. No leading process shall issue from any of the courts
of this State without security being given by the party at
whose instance the action is brought, for the successful prose
cution of his action, and, in case of failure, for the payment of
all costs and damages which may be awarded against him un
less in cases specially excepted by law. [Act 1787, ch. 19, §1.]
A Justice of the Peace may also demand security for costs. Q3 2818, 4l44.——
The State prosecutes without giving security for costs. Q 2S06.—Whether a
county may or not, was not decided in Davis v. Hansard, 9 Humph. 173, but it
would seem from that case that a county trustee prosecuting for public funds
would be required to give security.-An answer in chancery which contains no
bond for costs, and upon which no process issues will not be entertained as a cross
bill. Keelc v. Cunningham, l Heisk. 288, 291.—A recognizance acknowledged in
open court, and entered of record, may well be substituted for a prosecution bond.

§ 3 Head, 152, 156.

A recognizance for costs is good, although the party to whmir

bound is not named, if -the party agrees to be defendant's security for costs. 2
Head, 253. An earlier case held that the bond ought to state against whom the
suit was commenced, the nature or kind of action, whether debt, case or covenant,
etc. Eason v. Henderson, 2 Yerg. 522. But a later case holds that the bond need
not state the nature of the action. Chunie v. Bull, 8 Yerg. 219. And thisis
the better opinion. Broyles v. Blair, 7 Yerg. 279. It is suﬁicient if it state the

names of the parties, and the court in which the suit is brought.

_'I Yerg. 279.

A bond conditioned that the plaintiff“ shall prosecute a suit this day commenced

§ 3188. Any clerk who neglects to take the security required

by the preceding section, is liable on his oﬁicial bond to all
persons aggrieved thereby.

[Ib., § 3, modiﬁed.]

Liability of cle1'k.—A clerk is liable at common lawfor negligence in not tak
ing a good bond, and this liability has not been changed by statute; and it is not
necessary for him to proceed against the plaintiﬁ‘ in the original suit to ascertain

his damages before suing the clerk.

Pass v. Dibrell, 8Yerg. 470.

But he is not

liable for taking a defective appeal bond, for that is a judicial act of the court.

McAlister v. Scrice, 7 Yerg. 277. [But would this rule hold in chancery cases,
where the appellant is allowed time after adjournment to give bond before the
clerk and master? See note to Q 3192; Andrews v. Page, 2 Heisk. 634, 688.—
§ 3189. In an action commenced by petition or motion, the 1-e,m.,.,,,,

plaintiff may be required to give security.
[Act 1826, ch. 29, §1.]
§ 3190. The plaintiff in an action commenced before a Jus- Plalnmfbefore
'
Justice. ruled
tice of the Peace, shall, on motion, be ruled to give security ‘¢,’;§,§',","U'g,,‘,'}_
in the Circuit Court, to which the cause may be taken for the

correction of errors.

[Act 1813, ch. 131, § 2.]
The extent of the liability ofa person who became surety under the original act,

was merely for “costs of suit,” (the language of the original act,) and although in
such a case, the defendant recovered a judgment against the plaintiff on his cross
claim, it was error to render judgment against the surety jointly with his princi
pal for the amount of defendant’s excess. Bolinger v. Gordon, 11 Hnmph. 61,
§ 63.
~

§ 3191. Any person required by law to give security for costs Rule t-0 me or
may, at any stage ot the cause, be ruled to give such security, vi-ﬂow
if it has not previously been done, or to justify or give new
security on suﬂicient cause shown. [Act 1829, ch. 33, § 2.]
Before this statute it was held the the Act of 1787, ch. 19, [Q 8187,] did not
authorize the courts after the security for costs had been once given, to compel
the plaintiff to give,new and ariditional security, if the ﬁrst bond were lost; or if
the snreties became, insolvent, or removed out of the State. Jones v. Kearns,
Hart. & Yerg. 241 ; Owen v. Grundy, 8 Yerg. 436. By the principles of the com
mon law governing the courts both of law and equity, a plaintiff could not be
turned out of court for want of security for costs, or by reason of his inability to
give it, if he were personally resident within the jurisdiction of the court, and
amenable to its process. Mart. 8: Yerg. 243-4. A non-resident petitioner for
certiorari who had no property in this State, except the property in dispute,
might be ruled to give security for costs, or have his certiorari dismissed. Mur
free v. Leeper, 1 Tenn. 1. And since the above statute it has been held that, the
policy of thelaiv beingto give every man an opportunity to investigate his rights,
where the plaintiff is ruled to give security for costs, and such security is offered at
any time during the term at which the suit is ordered, in case of his failure, to be
dismissed, it would be a proper exercise of discretion to receive it. Sharp v. Mil
ler, 3 Sneed, 42-4. And where a party had been ruled to give security for costs
by the second day of the next term, and for failing to do so his suit was dismissed
on the third day, and the court, on the ﬁfth day, set aside the dismissal and al
lowed him to give security, this was proper, and the refusal to do so might have

been reversible error. Ib.; Irvins v. Mathis, 11 Hnmph. 608, 606.

Although the

motion to dismiss must he made at the term at which the rule isto be complied
with, and cannot be made at a succeeding term, yet the defendant may make a
new motion at any subsequent term, and this would be the better and more con
venient prnctice. ll Hnmph. 606. Although the order be worded that the suit
stand dismissed at a speciﬁed time, ifthe rule is not complied with, this would have
no more effect than though it read that the suit be dismissed; for it would require
a further judgment of the court to dismiss the suit, in the one case as well as the
other; and besides, a practice of dismissing suits by anticipation might be of evil
consequences as to the just rights of parties. Ib. A rule to justify security ex

pires at the term at which it is to be complied with, and cannot be enforced at a
suesequent term, although no court is held at the term at which it is to be com

plied with.

Bettie v. Mansﬁeld, 11 Hnmph. 604; Irvins v. Mathis, Ib., 608, 607;
If the rule is to be complied with by the

next term, or a given day of the term, it will continue in force for the time so
limited and no longer, with the understanding, however, that it is in the power of
the court to enforce or discharge the rule at any day of the same term after the
day limited for giving the security, as in the discretion of the court the justice of
the case may require. The settled practice sceiﬁ to be that the refusal to allow
the party to give security after the cause has been dismissed for failure to comply
with the rule, (although a stringent practice and one to be disoouruged,) will not
constitute error for which the Supreme Court will reverse; yet if the security be

tendered before ﬁnal judgment upon the rule, the court has no discretion to refuse
it.

Bcttis v. Mansﬁeld, ll Humph. 604, 606.

§ 3192. Except for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution
and slanderous words, any person may commence an action

without give security as above required, by taking and subscrib

“ I, A. B., do solemnly swear, that owing to my poverty I
am not able to bear the expenses of the action which I am

dress sought, to the best of my belief. ”
[Act 1821, ch. 22, §§ 1, 2; modiﬁed by 1829, ch. 88.]

§ 44 ; Herd v. Dew, 9 Humph. 865.

Butin one ease it was held that the pauper oath,

substituted for the appeal bond, must be taken before the court, the taking of it
being a judicial act; and if taken before a Justice of the Peace, it was a nullity,
and the appeal must be dismissed. 5 Sneed, 679. This case is commented upon.
in Andrews v. Page, 1 Heisk. 634, 641, where it is said that it correctly holds that

on an appeal from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, the pauper oath can
not be taken before a Justice of the Peace. And where the order granting the
appeal allowed time after adjournment in course to execute the appeal bond, the
condition was not complied with by taking the pauper oath. Morris v. Smith, 1
Thomp. Cas. 48; llcPhatridgo v. Gregg, 4 Cold. 824. 'And see Hale v. Parmley,
§ 1 Thomp. Cas. 46. But Andrews v. Page, 2 Heisk. 634, holds that time beyond

the term may be allowed by the chancellor to take the pauper oath upon an ap
peal prayed and granted, and goes far to destroy the authority of these 05:505.
But it is still held that an appeal taken to the Supreme Court, upon the pauper
oath, taken before the clerk below, out of term time, and at a time unauthorized

by the order of the court, is a nullity. 2 Heisk. 642. An appeal in forma pau
peris is allowable on behalf of a defendant against whom a judgment is rendered
for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution or slanderous words, and the right
is not aﬁected by the above section. Heatherly v. Bridges, 1 Heisk. 220. it is

BISO held that where a person applies to the clerk of the Supreme Court [under
I 3177,] for a writ of error, and tenders the pauper oath, he has no discretion to
refuse it.

Morris v. Smith, ll Humph. 188.

The aﬂidavit must be made pnrt of

the record, so that the revising court can see that the statute has been complied
with. 9 Humph. 367. To entitle a party to an appeal informa pauperia, he
must make oath—-not that on account of his poverty, he is unable to give security,

but that owing to his poverty he is unable to bear the ezpemm of the suit.

The statute confers a personal privilege only. Hence, a personal representative
cannot, as such, prosecute suit on oath of the insolvency of the estate; but if a

Liability of suretice.—As the above sections change the previous law in regard
to the undertaking and liability of sureties for the prosecution of suits, it is thought
best, in addition to what has been stated underﬂ 3204, to state here the previous
decisions on the subject.—Under the Act of 1787, ch. 19, on a bond with the usu
al conditions, it was held that the surety was not linhle for intermediate costs ad~

judged against his principal, such as costs imposed on setting aside a nonsuit.
Colville v. McKinney, 1 Yerg. 448.

A surety forthe prosecution of costs, was not

liable for costs or charges beyond the judgment of the court in which the suit was
in-ttilufed ; that is, in case the plaintiﬁ‘ below obtained judgment, nnd the same was
afterwards reversed on error in the appellate court, and the cause remanded, the
surety was not bound for the costs of the appellate court. Hawkins v. Thornton,

§ 1 Yerg. 146. But the reverse is now held under the above Act of 1860, ch. 120.
Ogg v. Leinart, 1 Hcisk. 40, 43. But where the muse was transferred to another
court by consent of both parties, under the Act of 1827, ch. 72, Q 1, this did not
discharge the surcties. Broyles v. Blair, 7 Ycrg. 279. [But how would this be

in case of a cause transferred under the Act of Congress to one oi‘ the Federal
courts? See Williams v. Adkins, 6 Cold. 615.]
The object of the snrety’s undertaking is to indemnify the defendant against the
payment of costs by him incurred in his just defense.

§ 674, 676.

Locke v. i\lcFalls, 3 Sneed,

The surety is only liable to the extent of the bond, and when this is

less than the entire costs, the surety cannot discharge his obligation by paying

ﬁrst, the plainti_ﬂ".s witnesses, and the balance for which he is liable to the clerk.
The defendant has s right after satisfaction of the costs due the oﬂicers of the
court, to have the balance applied to the satisfaction of his witnesses, and such

other costs as he may be liable for.

succeeds in his defense, and the others do not, the defendant who succeeds may
recover of the plaintiff such costs only as ‘accrued sqmratsly and properly on ac

count of his being a defendant in the suit; and the plaintiif is entitled to recover of the other defendants, the costs of the suit incurred in the joint defense, or
otherwise, except such as may he separated therefrom, as having exclusive refer
ence to the defendant who succeeds. Sloan v. Parks, 2 Swan, 62; quoted approv

ingly in 5 Sneed, 367. But where the defendants sever in ejcctment, for the rea.
son that different questions are involved between them and the plaintiff upon dif
ferent titles, this has the elfect of making several causes, and a separate taxation
of costs in each case is proper. Den v. Hull‘, 1 Thomp. Gas. 24.
Seieral counts.—Sep¢1'¢1li07l- of costs.-Where a plaintiff joins several causes of
action by means of several counts in his declaration, and recovers as to some of
the counts and fails as to others, he can recover only such costs as are incident to
that count in the declaration on which he succeeds; while the defendant is enti

tled to recover such costs as have accrued in consequence of the counts upon
which the plaintiff has failed.

In such case, the proper practice is to render

judgment and award execution in behalf of the defendant, for such costs as he
may bc thus entitled to recover. Allison v. Thompson, 2 Swan, 202; cited ap
provingly in 5 Sneed, 356.--In one case, where there had been error against both
pm-tics, the Supreme Court ordered the costs divided. Up to the time of the trial
in the Circuit Court, the error had been against the defendant in error; and it was

adjudged that he recover costs up to that time.

In rendering the verdict and

judgment, the Circuit Court erred against the plaintiff in error ; it was therefore

adjudged that he recover the costs of the Supreme Court, and of the judgment of
the Circuit Court. Dixon v. Caruthers, 9 Yerg. 30, 32.
Costs of Sci-o_ﬂ".—'i'his is governed by Q 2922, which repeals the rule laid down
in Boothe ,v. Cowan, 5 Sneed, 854. It was said in one case, though the question
did not arise, that where the defendant recovers against the plaintiff by way of

set-oil‘ an excess over the plaintiff's recovery, he cannot have judgment against
the plaintiff's surety for costs.

McKernon v. Hale, 1 Yerg. 397.

Bolinger v. Gordon, 11 Humph. 61-63.

Where the plaintiff succeeds in establishing his

demand, and the defendant also succeeds on his plea of set-off, but the excess is

found in favor of the plaintiff and judgment is rendered therefor, the defendant
is entitled to‘have taxed against the plaintiﬁ the costs of the witnesses examined
by him in establishing his set-otf. Maupin v. Whitson, 2 Heisk. l.
Road ca.ses.—In contests in the County Court between the public and citizens
relative to the establishment of roads, the costs follow the result of the suit, under
the general law. Senaker v. Sullivan County, 4 Sneed, 116. But if private indi
viduals be parties on both sides, no judgment can be rendered for costs, for want
of proper parties; but the oﬁicers and witness must be left to their remedy by
suit against those to whom services were rendered, or by whose action they have
been required to act. Evans v. Shields, 3 Head, '70. And it is error to tax a
party with costs anterior to his being made a party. Beard v. Justices of Camp
bell County, 3 Head, 9'_I. Nor can the party applying to have a road opened, be
required to give security for the costs, upon the appeal of the party through whose
land the road is opened. lb.
In an action for meme proﬁts, the plaintiff may recover, not only the reason
able value of the rents and proﬁts, but also the costs of the ejectment suit; but
these costs do not include counsel fees. White v. Clack, Swan, 230.
Endors¢'r.—An endorser for value has no remedy against the maker for the
costs incurred in his defense; but an accommodation mrlorser may recover from
the maker the costs incurred in resisting in good faith, and upon reasonable
grounds a recovery against him upon his endorsement. Overton v. Hardin, 6 Cold.

§ 375, 381.
Costa of continuance.—Judgment for costs of continuance once rendered, is necessarily ﬁnal, and as distinct from the main judgment as if it had taken place

in a distinct controversy, and such costs should not be incorporated with those of
the principal judgment. Ross v. McCarty, 3 Humph. 169. The piaintiii"s surety

§ 3198. In all civil actions founded upon assaults, assaults §g,',1=°,r<= @035
and battery, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, slan
derous words, or for the recovery of damages for overﬂowing
of water, by the erection oi’ a grist-mill, or other water-works
of utility, the plaintiif recovers no more costs than damages,
unless the recovery exceed ﬁve dollars. [Act 1715, ch. 27,
§8; 1811, ch. 91; 1829, ch. 1, § l; 1851-2, ch. 146.]
“ Slanderous words."-Seeﬁ B402. Construing together this section and}
§ 3402, the rule is deduced in conformity with the old law, that in actions for assaults,
assaults and battery, false imprisonment, etc., where the damages exceed ﬁve dol
lars ; or in actions for slander, where the damages are under ﬁve dollars, the plain
tiﬁ‘ recovers no more costs than damages. Applying this rule, it was held that

where the plaintiﬂ‘ in an action of slander recovered ﬁve dollars damages, he was
entitledto full costs. Bates v. Sullivan, 8 Head, 682.
“ Over;/lowing of water.”-It was held, under the original Act of 1851-2, ch.
§ 146, which related to suits for damages occasioned by the overﬂowing of water,
that in a case where the plaintiﬁ recovered no more costs than damages, the act
being silent as to the residue of costs, judgment could not be rendered against the

plaintiii‘ for the residue of costs, after awarding him costs equal to his damages,
but as to such residue, each party should be left liable for his own proper costs,

and judgment should be rendered against the parties respectively. Gardenhire v. Mc
Combs, 1 Sneed, 83, 86. By the Act of 1811, ch. 91, Q2, the defendant in such a.
case was entitled to judgment against the pls.intii1"s for the entire residue of costs.
Ib.

To entitle the defendant to the beneﬁt of this statute, the record must show

that the dam causing the overﬂow was connected with the keeping up of a grist
mill 'or other work of utility ; otherwisethe judgment must follow the general law

of costs.

McRe_vnolds v. Gates, 7 Humph. 29; Gray v. 'l‘ate, 11 Humph. 64.

The

fact that the overﬂow was caused by s dam, or a mill-dam, is not suﬂicient to
bring the case within the statute. Ib. And although it were true that the dam was
needed for a grist mill or other waterworks of utility, and that fact may have ap

peared in proof before the Circuit Court, but such fact not appearing in the
record, the Supreme Court will not presume it, notwithstanding every reasonable
intendment is to be made in favor of the judgment of inferior courts. lb.

promised and dismissed before the return day of the original

writ, or before the court to which an appeal is taken from the
§ 87 ram. srsr. judgment of a Justice of the Peace, no costs, except the clerk’s

[Act 1826, ch. 28, § 1.]

This section does not authorize the dismissal of an appeal before the clerk of
the court below, aﬂer the rise of the court. By appeal granted and ﬁnal adjourn
ment of the court below, the cause is transferred to the appellate court, and the
appeal can only be dismissed there. Freeman v. Henderson, 5 Cold. 647. A dis
missal in vacation puts an end to the suit, and terminates thecontrol of the court

over it, as fully as if made in term time. By the dismissal in either mode, by the
voluntary act of the parties, the power and jurisdiction of the court over the cause
are at an end, except to render judgment for the costs of suit, or to make such
orders as may be indespensable to give eﬂ‘ect to the dismissal. Thompson v.

§ 3200. Where suit is brought in the name of one, for the

use ofanother, the person for whose use the action is brought
is the real plaintiﬁ, against whom judgment for costs shall be
given.
This act (1825, ch. 29,) in cases where suit may properly be brought in the
name of one person for the use of another, subjects the latter to costs, but does
not multiply the cases in which suit may be so brought, nor in any manner, ex
cept as to costs, extend the powers of the court. Smith v. Milbry, 9 Yerg. 813,

§ 316.-—And see Hargiss v. Ayres, 8 Yerg. 467 ; Anderson v. Brady, 8 Yerg. 297 ;
Q 2796; § 2795, and note.
How far the nominal plaintitf is the real plaintiﬂ‘, is a question on which the
cases are by no means uniform; Neilson fv. Gilliam, 7 Yerg. 474, holding him
the real plaintiﬂ‘, while Erwin v. Rutherford, 1 Yerg. 169, 175, pronounces him
a mere shadow; and in Burton v. Dees, 4 Yerg. 4, 7, his name is only used to pre
serve form, without subjecting him to costs or ccmscquencea. These decisions
arose subsequently to the Act of 1825, the words of which are preserved in the

Code, Q 2795, 2858, 3200.

§ 3Q0l. In cases of nonsuit, dismission, abatement by death

of plaintiif, or discontinuance, the defendant is the successful

[Act 1794-, ch. 1, § 74, modiﬁed.]
But the costs adjudged against the plaintiﬂ‘ as terms on setting aside anon-suit,
cannot be collected out of the plaintiﬂ"s surety.

Colville v. McKinney, 1 Yerg.,
Costs on arrest of judgment were not embraced in the Act of 1794, ch. 1
Q 74, [nor expressly in the Code,] and the common law rule was adopted of hold
ing each party liable for his own costs, but the liability is to be enforced by judg
ment as in other cases. Caldwell v. State, 2 Sneed, 490.

_ Removal to U. S. Court.—Where u cause is transferred under Act of Congress
from a State Court to a Federal Court, no judgment for costs can be rendered by
the State Court. Williams v. Adkins, 6 Cold. 615, 617.
“Successful
Diff!-“

§ 3202. So, also, if the appeal of the defendant from a Jus- _

tice’s judgment is dismissed for any cause, the original plain
tiﬁ' is the successful party; and so of other cases.
§ 3203. Full costs up the time of overruling the plea shall Costs on piss
be adjudged against the defendant, who unsuccessfully reliesmbmmlm
upon a plea in abatement.
The failure of the court to give judgment for coats when the plea is overruled,
does not prevent judgment for costs according to law, when the cause is ﬁnally
disposed of.

Thus, the costs incident to an overruled plea in abatement may be

adjudged against a defendant who has pleaded over, and made a successful defense,
and the refusal so to adjudge them is error.

Rose v. Bolinger, 6 Hnmph. 26.

§ 8904. All costs accrued at the instance of the successful Costalimlnst
successful

party, which cannot be collected out of the other party, may pnw. when

In a suit at law, where the bond is conditioned that the plaintiff shall prosecute his suit with eﬁect, or in case of failure pay all costs and damages incident on fail
ure thereof, [the ordinary formula, prior to the Act of 1860, ch. 120, M 3196 a
§ 8196 c,] the liability of a surety ceases on the recovery of a judgment against the
defendant. Carren v. Breed, 2 Cold. 465; Kennedy v. Jack, 1 Yerg. 82. The

rule is diﬂ'erent in equity ; for there the defendant undertakes with reference to
the discretionary power of the chancellor to award costs against either party; he
is hence liable for costs adjudged against his principal, although his principal suc

ceeds in obtaining a ﬁnal decree against the defendant.

Allison v. Stephens, 2

Head, 251 ; Glaze v. Eason, 2 Yerg. 801 ; recognized in 2 Cold. 468, and in Ogg

v. Leinart, 1 Heisk. 40, 43.

Both at common law and under the above section,

where the plaintiﬂ' has recovered a judgment against the defendant, and the costs
cannot be collected out of him, the parties entitled to them may recover them
against the plaintiff. 2 Cold. 465 ; Ewing v. Lusk, 4 Yerg. 459. [The case in 2
Coldwell, though arising subsequently to the Act of 1860, ch. 120,} 3196 a,et scg.,

takes no notice ofitsprovisions] But the clerk cannot issue an execution against
a successful plainriﬁ for costs adjudged against the defendant, merely upon the
return of an execution against the defendant, “no property found." In all cases

judgment must precede execution ; and before the above statute, a scire facias ,
for it was said, where there is a liability of record depending upon a contingency,
a wire fucias is necessary before the party can be charged.

Washington v.

Ewing, Mart. & Yerg. 45. And see Broyles v. Blair, 7 Yerg. 279.

Under this

section, the clerk has no authority to enter a motion to obtain a judgment for any

more than his own costs.

Stewart v. McCuistion, 1 Heisk. 427, 430.

A judg

ment by motion under the above section, must have all the requisites of other

judgments by motion. It must show by suﬂicient description the cause in which
the costs accrued; the issue of an execution ; a suﬂicient return of an execution,
showing search and want of property ; the production of the execution on the
trial of the motion, and the right of the applicant to judgment. Ib. Bee further

See as to this plea Q} 2892, 2909.—'1'his section incorporates the doctrine of
Gannon v. Blakemore, 10 Humph. 227, and Campbell v. Reeves, 8 Sneed, 62.
Wliere the suit originated before a justice, and matter in discharge of the defend
ant's liability arising since the commencement of the suit, is pleaded, ore temw,
in the Circuit Court, this is a plea “since the last continuance ” within the mean
ing of the rule. The defendant may, to get the beneﬁt of time, reduce it to writ
_ ing and ﬁle it, but if he fails to do so, it takes effect only at the trial, and charges
him with all the costs up to that time. 10 Humph. 228 ; S Sneed, 63.

On abatement.

§ 3209. When a plaintiff suffers his action to abate by the
death of the defendant, or other cause; or where the suit
abates by _the death of the plaintiif, and his representatives fail
to revive the same, judgment for costs may be rendered against

such plaintiff or representatives, in the name of the oﬁcers of
court, and, if against a representative, shall be paid as other
claims against the estate. [Ib., § 2389.]

in which the clerk has erred.

[Ala. Code 1852, § 2394.]

The taxation of mats is at all times under the control of the court; and costs
collected may be ordered to be refunded ata subsequent term, if found to be

erroneous. Williams v. Henderson, 1 Tenn. 424. The taxation of costs in any
court is but incidental to s. suit in such court, and on grounds of public con
venience must be left to the forum rendering the judgment. Whitesides v. Rayle, '
§ 8 Humph. 205. Hence, acourt of chancery has no power to correct a taxation
of costs made by a. court of law. Ib. ; Ross v. McCarty, 8 Humph. 169. And so

Strongly is this principle adhered tn, that it is a settled rule of practice that the’
Supreme Court will not in chancery cases, entertain jurisdiction for the purpose
of correcting the most erroneous decision on the subject of costs merely. 8 Humph.
§ 206. The Supreme Court will correct an erroneous taxation of costs in a case
ﬁnally determined there. Ib. The Judge trying ncause may look to his own
notes made at the time, in revisinga taxation of the costs. Ib. The Supreme
Court has ample power to revise an erroneous taxation of costs made by the
clerk below, and endorsed on the transcript in a cause pending before it. 3 Hum ph.
§ 170. But the taxation of costs in an inferior court for the attendance of
witnesses there, cannot be corrected in the superior court, unless s. motion is

made in the inferior court to correct the taxation, the opinion of the court had
upon the question, and the motion and judgment entered of record. Sherman v.
Brown, 4 Yerg. 561. A rule to show cause why s re-taxation of costs should not
be had is merely a collateral motion, and does not operate as a eupcrsedea: of the
execution, nor will it prevent a we're faoias against prosecution bail. Miller v.
Netherland, 1 Swan, 66, BB.

" ITt'ln.esses who were not e1:amined.”—'1'he fees of witnesses who do not at
tend the trial, cannot be taxed in the bill of costs. Williams v. Henderson, 1 Tenn.
§ 424. But it is not error to refuse to strike from the bill of costs, the costs of
witnesses summoned by the plaintiﬂ, and not examined, when it appears that the
defendant also summoned witnesses who were not examined. Knox v. Thomas, 6

Humph. 578, 575. If witnesses are summoned to prove matters inadmissible in
evidence, the costs of their attendance must be taxed to the party milling them.
Sherman v. Brown, 4 Yerg. 416.

On an appeal from aJustice‘s judgment, if

the plaintiff summon witnesses to rebut a defense made below, without the de
fendant summoning witnesses tomake the defense in the Circuit Court, the de
fendant cannot be taxed with the costs of such witnesses; for in such case, there
is no reasonable ground for their attendance. Lovitt v. Peterson, 6 Humph. 23.

A witness incompetent by reason of interest was allowed his fees in Gray v. Alex
ander, 7 Humph. I6. A witness attending without being summoned, cannot have
his attendance taxed in the bill of costs. He rnust look to the party requesting

his attendance. Hopkins v. Waterhouse, 2 Yerg. 280. A witness who has been
summoned by botltparties is entitled to costs for one attendance only. Ib. A
witness may sue the party who summoned him for the attendance money allowed
him by law, although he lives in the county in which the suit is pending, and the
cause is not ﬁnally determined. Witherspoon v. Killough, Mart. 8: Yerg. 88; rec

The rule before this statute was, that where a court dismisses a cause for want
of jurisdiction, no judgment can be rendered for costs. Tsul v. Collingsworth, 2

As to the manner in which the items shall be set out, see Q3016, and note.—As
to the penalty for sending up imperfect trancripts, see Q 4557, and note.-Costs
adjudged against a party below on the continuance of the cause, ought not to be
sent up to the court of errors on appeal or writ of error, but should be collected
below ; if sent up, the court would cause them to be stricken out in taxation of
the costs above, and grant a super-aedeaa, if necessary. Ross v. McCarty, 3

§ 3218. On receiving said costs, the clerk of the court below Whoshall
shall charge himself with the money, upon his execution docket, my “ on

and pay it to the persons entitled to the same.
Costs rightfully belong to the witnesses and Qﬂicers of the court, and although a
pa:-ty’s name is used in the collection, he still has no right to receive the same.
Cary v. Campbell, 3 Sneed, 62; Smith v. Van Bibber, 1 Swan, 110, 118-14. If
therefore the clerk of the court improperly pays to the plaintiff the costs of a
suit, he is liable for the same by motion. 8 Sneed, 62. But if costs are improp
erly taxed in favor of a witness, and collected from the losing party, the losing

party cannot maintain an action against the witness to recover them back; he
must sue the winning party to the suit. Gray v. Alexander, 7 Humph. 16, 18.
Costs recovered by the defendant are to be applied, ﬁrst, to the payment of the

cost due the oiﬁcers of the court, then to the defendant’; witnesses. Locke v. McFalls, 3 Sneed, 674. [And then to the plaintiﬂ”s witnesses.—Eds.] For by our
practice where n judgment is-rendered for costs generally, it is a recovery of all
costs which have by law accrued; and when legally taxed and the amount ascer
tained, the judgment is a judgment for that amount. Gillet v. Roadman, I5 Humph.

This statute has reference to cases where it becomes the duty of the court in

The Act of 1851-2, ch. 152, Q 2, so far modiﬁes the rules of the common law,
and the principal declared in Kelly v. Hare, 1 Humph. 163, that a person claim

ing a legal title to land, though not in possession thereof, against another having
a legal title to the same land, is subject to be sued in ejectment, upon the naked
ground of his adverse claim. Smith v. Lee, 1 Cold. 549, 551 ; Langford v. Love,
§ 8 Sneed, 308, 812. The Act of 1852 applied only to legal titles and legal inter
ests, leaving the law in this respect as it was before. The action of ejectment
cannot be maintained unless the plaintiﬂ‘ has the legal estate in the premises, and

an equitable title cannot be set up in this action against the legal title. 8 Sneed,
§ 812. But this rule is now so far modiﬁed by statute, that avendee may set up his
interest by title bond against his vendor. i 8248 a. The legal title only can be
looked to; and, in general, the plaintiff's recovery cannot be resisted on the ground
of an outstanding equitable title in a third person, or even in the defendant.

Under the law in force prior to this section, it was necessary that the sheriff
deliver the declaration to the defendant, and road and eaplain the same.

[Ib., sub-sec. 21.]
Where the verdict is for pert only, it must specify and deﬁne such part by

metes and bounds, a reference to other tracts, or natural or artiﬁcial objects, so that the same can be identiﬁed; and if the evidence be not snﬁcient to enable

the jury to give such a description, the cause should be delayed until, by proper
surveys or additional proof, such description can be given. Loard v. Phillips, 4
Sueed, 566; Brogan v. Savage, 5 Sneed, 689. A verdict for the plaintiﬁ which

does not specify the plaintiffs interest in the estate,_under this statute, is a nul
lity; and if, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the record discloses this error alone,
a new trial will be granted.

ages for the withholding of the premises by the defendant;
and as to the premises, the judgment shall be that the defend~

_
§ 3249. A general verdict in favor of the plaintiff, WithOi1tGe'neral
such speciﬁcations, entitles the plaintiff to the quantity of in- "mm
terest, or estate, and the premises, as set forth and described in
the declaration. [According with sub-sec. 23, Ibid.]
This section was evidently intended to change the rule of Van Fossen v. Pear
son, 4 Sneed, 362. See note to i 8247.

§ 3250. The judgment for the plaintiff is that he recover the Judgment,
possession of the premises according to the verdict, or, if by
default or on demurrer, according to the description in the
declaration. [Ib., sub-sec. 28.]
This section only means where the case goes off ﬁnally upon the overruling of
the demurrer, on failure to make any farther defense, as the defendant may do
as a matter of right under Q 2936. Martin v. Nance, 3 Head, 649, 651.

§ 3251. The judgment is executed by a writ of possession 1,-,m,,,,,,,,_
issued to the sheriﬂ',- and directing him to put the plaintiff in
possession of the premises. [Ib., and sub-sec. 20.]
Who may be removed by writ of possession :-All who enter upon the land
pending the action. Wallen v. Huh‘, 3 Sneed, 82.—All the tenants, where the
landlord defends, although but one is sued. Hickerman v. Dale, '7 Yerg. l49.—It
the plaintilf is put in possession of land not embraced in his recovery, the defend

ant is restored to possession bya writ of restitution. Blair v. Pathkiller, 5 Yerg.
§ 230; Hickman v. Dale, 7 Yerg. 149. See Q 2997, and note.

§ 3252. Any such judgment is conclusive upon the party mmo,’ud“_

against whom it is recovered, not under disability at the time "‘°“"
of the recovery, and all persons claiming under him by title
accruing after the commencement of the action.
[Ib., sub-sec. 25.]
Hence the plaintiff in an action of ejectment is not concluded by a judgment in
a former action against his tenant, whereby the defendant recovered the same

land, and was put in possession thereof—if the plaintiff was not a party of record
in such former action. Boles v. Smith, 5 Snced, 105.—Seoond ejectment not

§ 3259. Nothing in this chapter contained deprives the plain
tiff of his right to an action for mesne proﬁts, after verdict and
judgment in his favor, nor the defendant of the right to ﬁle a

rights are subject to the general provisions of this Code regu

§ 3260. A tenant in possession in good faith, under a lease Rent mam lﬂllhﬂlt

[Act 1813, ch. 24; 1827, ch. 46.]

The ﬁrst Act on the subject of the above three sections, was 1797, ch. 43, Q 8 ;
then 1805, ch. 42; then 1818, ch. 24, and ﬁnally 1827, ch. 46.--The Acts of
§ 1797, ch. 43, Q 8, and 1805, ch. 42, were declared constitutional in Townsend v.
Shipp's Heirs, Cooke, 293, but were held to extend only to cases where equity had
formerly alforded relief. Asimilar view was taken of the Act of 1818, in Brieatoe
v. Evans, 2 Tenn. 341. The other decisions where these statutes have been con
sidered are Weatherhead v. Bledsoe, 2 Tenn. 352; Nelson v. Allen, 1 Yerg. 877 ;

Nicely v. Boylcs, 4 Humph. 177.

In case of partition by

judgment of court there is an implied warranty between the parties by which they
have the mutual right, in case of an eviction by paramount title, to have compen
sation from each other for the loss sustained; and this right exists against

alienees, though not in their favor; and the remedy is by bill in chancery, either
by setting aside the partition as being founded in mistake, if it can be done with

§ 3293. Any person entitled to a partition of premises under 5:1,:£0» par
the foregoing provisions, is equally entitled to have such prem'
ises sold for division, in the following cases:

[Act 1827, ch. 54, § 1; 1829, ch. 3 5, §l.]
§ 1. If the premises are so situated that partition thereof can
not be made. [Act 1854, ch. 48, § 1.]
§ 2. Where the premises are of such description that it would

be manifestly for the advantage of the parties that the same
should be sold instead ofpartitioned.

[Act 1827, ch. 54, § 1.]

The original Acts of 1827 and 1829, drawn into the Code in the above section,
were interpreted in Helm v. Franklin, 5 Humph. 404. A tcnant in common is
entitled as a matter of right, to partition, and whenever partition cannot be made
without serious injury, he is entitled to a sale, in order to effect a partition with
out injury. Ib.—As to the extent of the jurisdiction of the County Court in refer
ence to sales for partition, see § 4205, and note; 2 Head, 879; 8 Sneed, 369; 2
Cold. 596; 4 Cold. 598.—-Courts have no power to order a sale of the land of

minors for partition, for the general advantage of the minors, unless the proof
clearly and certainly establishes the fact that, in one case, the land is so situated
that partition cannot be made in the mode pointed out by law; or in the other,

that the lands are of such a description that it would be manifestly to the advantage
of the heirs that it be sold.

Davidson v. Bowden, 5 Sneed, I29.

Agreements among devisees to sell for partition will be set aside, when. Doug
lass v. Harrison, 2 Sneed, 382. The Circuit or Chancery Court of the county in
which the real estate of any minor lay, might, under the original acts, on the ex
parts application of such minor, order the sale of his real estate, where it ap

peared manifestly to his interest that it should be sold. Brown, ea: parte, 8 Humph.
§ 200.

But the original statutes conferred no power on the Chancery Court to de

cree a sale of lands on an infant’s ea: parts petition, lying without its local juris
diction. Reid, ezparte, 5 Sneed, 375. But where the tracts of land lie in di1fer
ent counties, the court of chnnccry has jurisdiction to make partition of any or

all the lands within the State. Todd v. Cannon, 8 Humph. 512.

The court of

chancery had power by virtue of the Act of 1827, to make such disposition of the

proceeds of the sale as should be most beneﬁcial to the infant; whether to invest it
in other lands or lend it out upon security. Rogers v. Clark, 5 Sneed, 665. The
Chancery Court may do this without the aid of the statute. Taylor v. Keeton, 10
Humph. 536, 539; contra, 5 Sneed, 668. In aproceeding under this statntethe in
fant is not entitled to a day in court, after attaining the age of twenty-one years,
to show cause against the dccree, or elect whether he will be bound by it or not.

If the sale is regular, and within the provisions of the statute, it is a conversion

of the infaut’s real estate into personalty, and he is as much bound by it as adults,

with the qualiﬁcation that he may, after coming of age, impeach it for error upon
the face of the decree, and perhaps for fraud.

the original section.—Where a wife’s lands aro taken for public use, as by the
location of a railroad upon them, and the husband and wife together petition in
the Circuit Court for compensation, under the statute, Q 1326 at seq., the wife is

Blackmore v. Shelby, 8

This ruling was quoted and followed in Elrod v. Lancaster, 2 Head.

§ 571, 576, a case which arose before the Code, though decided subsequently, and
which does not notice the above section. This case and the doctrine on the sub
ject before the Code was considered in Hawkins v. England, 8 Head, 652, 654,

and, although the question was not properly before the court, the court take the
view that this section of the Code changes the previous rule only in case of sales
under this chapter; and that in a sale for partition, under the previous chapter,

this section could not apply. We have also the case of Collins v. Smith, 1 Head,
§ 261, which arose before the Code, and which holds that where minor heirs repre
sented by a next friend, were joined as complainants in a petition for partition,
and the next friend who was also a co-heir, became the purchaser, the ti‘tlethere
by acquired, so far as related to the portion of the infant heirs, was of such a

doubtful character that, on a hill for a speciﬁc performance, a court of equity
whould not impose it upon a subsequent purchaser. And the court say that un
der this section of the Code, such a purchase would be void, and they think it
would be so on well established principles of equity existing in the common law.

§ 3342. A forcible entry and detainer is where a person, by
force or strong hand, or with weapons, or by breaking open
the doors, windows, or other parts of the house, whether any
person be in it or not, or by any kind of violence whatsoever,
enters upon lands, tenements, or possessions in the occupation
of another, and detains and holds the same; or by threatening
to kill, maim, or beat the party in possession ; or by such words,
circumstances, or actions as have a natural tendency to excite
fear or apprehension of danger; or by putting out of doors or
carrying away the goods of the party in possession ; or by en
tering peaceably and then turning or keeping the party out of
possession by force or threats or other circumstances of terror.

[Ib., § 2.]
.Polt'ey of the law.—'1’he action of forcible entry and detainer is given to pre
serve the peace and harmony of society, by preventing persons who have conﬂict

lence and frequent breaches of the peace, too likely to arise from wrongful intru
sions into the possession of another. Childress v. Black, 9 Yerg. 820 ; Hopkins
v. Calloway, 8 Sneed, 11, 15. And to give a right to restitution under it, it isnot

so absured as to require actual bloodshed and violence and frequent breaches of
the peace in the acquisition or retention of possession. 9 Yerg. 320. This law
removes all temptation to the commission of violent acts, by compellingarestorm
tion of the property thus unlawfully taken, without regard to the best title. 8
Sneed, 16 ; Q 3354. In one case it is said that this remedy has been greatly
abused and perverted from its legitimate purposes, and has, perhaps, been produc
tive of far more numerous and serious rnischiefs than it was designed to prevent.
Scott v. Newsom, 4 Sneed, 457, 461. The object of the statute is to aiford a
speedy, cheap and expiditious mode of recovering a possession of which any one
has been deprived by force and violence, or where land is withheld from the less
or or remainder man after the termination of the lease or life estate. Hopkins
v. Galloway, 3 Sneed, 11, 12.--To put an end to all provoking and threatening
scrambles for possession. Gass v. Newman, 1 Head, 136, 188. Hence this ac
tion lies for possession of premises or lands belonging to the United. States. Ed

And see § 3854.

Two questions present themselves under this section :

§ 1. Was the plaintiﬂ‘ ever in actual possession of the premises in dispute?
§ 2. Was that possession ousted by the forcible entry and detainer of the de
feudant?

ILIL
The only questions to be inquired into in this proceeding are
a. Who was in possession?

b. How was that possession lost?

§ 9 Yerg. 95.

Questions of title cannot beinvestigated in this proceeding. Ib.; Q 3354. There
fore it has been held that no matter how perfect a man's title may be, if he enters
by violence upon the possession of another who has no title (hatever, he cannot
protect himself against the operation of the writ of forcible entry and detainer. Ib.
Even a landlord, after the expiration of his lease, cannot enter upon the posses

illustrating the policy of the law.

in possession of land without having a crop growing on it.

A person may be

Or, a person residing

in the house, or the ﬁeld enclosed bya fence, or any act done by the owner of the
land, after the tenant has left it, indicating an intention not to abandon but to
hold possession to himself, will continue possession in him. Davidson v. Phil

lips, 9 Yerg. 93, 96; quoting 4 Bibb, 888; lb. 426; 3 Marsh. 347. A posses
sion my exist without an actual residence on the land. It is enough if the enclos
ures are kept up and the doors of the house closed, so as to indicate that the

premises are not abandoned.

The use of land enclosed for pasturing or grazing

stock is as much a possession as if it were cultivated. But the accidental continu
ance or ranging of stock upon a place would not constitute possession, if the in

tention to abandon it had been evinced by declarations or actions. There must
be a concurrence of acts and intention to fulﬁll the idea of actual possession.
Hopkins v. Galloway, 3 Sneed, 11, 15. By locking the doors of the house, clos
ing the windows, and driving stock on the premises, a party acquires such a pos

session as, if forcibly ousted, this action will lie. 9 Yerg. 96. ‘Where the house
was locked and the windows closed, and the defendant demanded possession, and
was refused, and afterwards got possession, the inference was irresistible that he
got possession by “ breaking the doors, windows, or some other part of the
house"--a forcible entry within the very words of the above statute. Ib. To
constitute a forcible entry and detainer, it is not necessary that violence and
outrage upon person or property should in fact be resorted to. If the actual pos
session of another in a house or tenement, be invaded, taken and held under eir.

cumstances to show that it will not be surrendered withotlt a breach of the peace
on the one side or the other, this constitutes a case of forcible entry and detainer.
Ghildress v. Black, 9 Yerg. 817, 320; Turner v. Lumhrick, Meigs, 712, [This

last case is noted for an able analysis by Mr. Meigs, of the Act of 1821, ch. 14,
illustrated by a full citation of the authorities down to that time, 1838.] But it
is not the constructive entry which the law donomiuates “ breaking the dose ” of
another-which may constitute a trespass, and as to which the law implies force
which constitutes a case within this statute, but there must be something more
real and tangible. Thus, the taking peaoeable and quiet possession of an island
in a river, without any obstruction or impediment in the way, with no doors to
open, no gates to unbolt or fences to throw down, but all open and unoccupied,
isa case clearly beyond the scope of this remedy. 8 Sneed, 16. But the law im

plieaforca in every unauthorized entry upon the premises of which another is in
peaceabla possession, and likewise in every unauthorized obstruction of such pos
session. Actual force is not necessary. Thus, where the plaintiff had peaceable
possession of the premises, and had erected an enclosure thereon, and the defend

ant against the will, and in spite of the remonstrances of the plaintiff, came upon
the premises and erected an enclosure entirely around that of the plaintiﬂ‘, al.
though he did not remove any part of the plaintiiYs enclosure, or otherwise dis
turb the same, this was in law a forcible and unlawful seizure of the possession of
the plaintiffs enclosure, and an ouster of his possession, such as would entitle the

plaintiff to this action.

Gass v. Newman, 1 Head, 186.

Where the record fails

to show the manner in which the defendant obtained possession, the Supreme Court
will reverse for fa" ure of proof on a material point. Bird v. Fannon, 3 Head,
§ 12, 14. Where th plaintiif had removed from the premises, but indicated by
fastening the doors of the house, and the grates of the enclosure, that he did not
intend to abandon the- possession, and a casual trespasser opened the gates and

doors, and the defendant afterwards, and without any concert with the trespasser,
ﬁnding the house open, entered under a claim of title, and without actual force,
this was not a forcible entry in fact or in law, and he was not liable to be pro
ceeded against in this action, but could only be sued in an action in which the
strength of title could be tested. Greer v. Wroe, 1 Sneed, 246 ; cited approving

ly in 3 Sneed, 16, and in 3 Head, 14.

The doctrine of eviction by election has

no application to actions for forcible entry and detaincr. To maintain such an
action, the plaintiff must be actually expelled from the premises by force. Not

that he is bound to resist and ﬁght to the last extremity, nor, indeed, to ﬁght at
all; for he may retire without any resistance upon the appearance of force. But
before he can maintain the action, he must be actually out of possession. Thus,
where the plaintiff was dispossessed of a part of the premises before the com
mencement of the suit, and of the balance afterwards, he could only recover that
portion of which he was dispossessed before suit. White v. Suttle, 11 Humph.
§ 449. This action cannot be maintained to dispossess a party who has been put
in possession by command of a. court of competent jurisdiction ; as where a pug-.
chaser at master’s sale was put in possession by writ of possession. Where a person
is wrongfully dispossessed in this way, he must petition the court ordering the dis
possession to have himself re-instated; or if he have a superior title he may resort toejectment. Scott v. Newsom, 4 Sneed, 457. Whether the plaiutiﬂ was in
possession, at the time of the forcible entry complained oﬂ is a question of fact
for the jury. 9 Yerg. 96.

§ 3343. A forcible detainer is where a person enters 18W-Fotrﬁible
fully or peaceably, and holds unlawfully, and by any of the“ C
means enumerated in the foregoing section as constituting a
forcible entry. [Ib., §3.]

DOT

,

An action lies under this section where a party takes possession under a parol

contract of purchase, [void under the statute of frauds, Q 1758,] and afterwards
repudiates the contract and assumes to hold for himself. Beard v. Bricker, 2
Swan, 50; Sullivan v. Ivey, -2 Sneed, 487. But the possession is not unlawful, and
the action will not lie, until the verbal contract of sale is repudiated by one of
the parties, or both. 2 Sneed, 489; 2 Swan, 53. In such ease where the vendor
repudiates the contract, notice to quit is necessary, notwithstanding the con
trary provision in the Act of 1842, [Q 3351.] 2 Sneed, 489. But where a parol
purchaser buys in valid out-standing title, and holds under it, equity will not turn
him out of possession. The rule of Beard v. Bricker, reluctantly and doubtingly
followed in Sullivan v. Ivey, will not be extended so far. Redman v. Bowles, 5
Sneed, 547, 551. A tenant, however, cannot dispute the title of his landlord.
Washington v. Conrad, 2 Humph. 562; Coldwell v. Harris, 4 Humph. 24. And
as to how far n vendee occupies the same relation in this respect to his vendor,
see Meadows v. Hopkins, Meigs, 181 ; Knox v. Thomas, 5 Humph. 573 ; James v.
Patterson, 1 Swan, 309; Mitchell v. Barry, 4 Hayw. 136, Cooper’s Ed., and cita
tions. The force contemplated in the third section of the Act of 1821, as neo-'
essary to entitle the landlord to the remedy, need not be such as that he must
either himself commit a breach of the peace to get possession, or compel the
tenant to coinmit it in holding him out. Trousdale v. Damoll, 6 Yerg. 481, 435.
Wliere the landlord by his proof entitles himself to possession, the question ‘for the
jury, [now for the justices,] isforcc ornoforcc. Ib. Where it is the right of the

demandant to receive possession, the duty of the tenant to deliver it, and notice
has been given without effect, [now unnecessary, Q 8351,] the law implies the force;

for it is a willful and in fact forcible holding out against him who has the right
of possession. Ib. ‘Actual violence need not be proved to give effect to the
third section of this statute. lb.—If a party donates the use of a lot of his land
to the neighborhood for the purpose of maintaining a school thereon, the house
and ground, while so occupied, are in possession of the teacher, and not of the

owner of the fee ; and if, while so occupied, a third person talres forcible pos
session of it, the owner cannot maintain this action against the trespasser, until

such time as he would be entitled to the possession by the termination of the
school. Vanhook v. Story, 4 Humph. 59. Where a person took forcible pos
session of the house of another, and the owner afterwards told the trespasser
that if he had the title of a certain third person to the property, he had a. right to
the possession, but he did not believe he had her title,—such a hypothetical ad
mission did not amount to an assent that the trespasser had obtained possession
lawfully, or was holding lawfully, and would not estop the owner from recovery
in this action. Ib.

'

§ 3344. Unlawful detainer is where the defendant enters by mum

contract, either as tenant or as assignee of a tenant, or as per- "°'l"*°'
-sonal representative of a tenant, or as sub-tenant, or by collusion

with a tenant. and in either case, willfully and without force,
holds over the possession from the landlord, or the assignee of
the remainder or reversion. [@., § 5.]
§ 1
“ Unlawful detainer" was unknown in England and in this State until the Act
of 1821, ch. 14, Q I5. Hopkins v. Galloway, 3 Sneed, 11 ; Lane v. Marshall, Mart
& Yerg. 255, 260. T0'make a person guilty of unlawful detainer, under this sec
tion of the Act of 1821, there must have existed a contract of rent or lease for a
deﬁnite period, and the tenant must have held over after receiving written notice

to quit.

Mart. & Yerg. 160.

But notice to quit is now dispensed with.

Q 8351.—The purchaser of the remainder or reversion mny, by virtue of
this section, after the expiration of the term, maintain this action against
the tenant, or a sub-tenant in the same manner that his g-rsntor could.

Harley v. Rodgers, 5 Yerg. 217, 220.

And see Elliott v. Borsn, 2 Sneed, 662.

An agent employed to hold over for the owner, may at the same time be a lessee,
and have such an interest in the possession, that if ejected by the owner he would

be entitled to this remedy to recover possession.

Colcord v. Hall, 8 Heud, 625.

Where it was covenanted in the lease that in case the lessor should desire to sell
the premises before the expiration of the term, and upon notice of such desire to '
the lessee, and the payment of a certain sum of money, he should vacate the
premises and surrender the unexpired term of the lease, the lessee holding over
after receiving such notice and tender of the stipulated sum, was not guilty of un

lawful detainer.

Such a stipulation in a lease is a covenant merely, and not scan

dition or limitation. Sloan v. Cantrell, 6 Cold. 571. But if the effect of such I.
stipulation were to raise a limitation, the notice must conform to the terms of th

stipulation.

In this case, the notice was defective for failing to state that the

lcssors desired to sell the premises. Ib.—This action will not lie in favor of a
trustee, who has never had possession, against a naked trespusser, for there is no

privity between him and the trespasser, and the idea of tenancy, even by implica
tion, is excluded. Kuhn v. Feiser, 8 Head, 82. [And the plsintiﬂ‘ has not been

This statute only bars the remedy and confers no right, and the possession of
two different parties cannot be united so us to bring the case within the statute.
Thompson v. Holt, 9 Humph. 407. [This case states every loosely that the above
provision is not “like the statute of limitations in the action of ejectment ” where the possession of a. tenant may enure to the beneﬁt of his landlord; whicn means

that it is a statute of négative prescription, like@ 2766; and as under that section,
the possession of two trespassers without color of title cannot be united so as to
form one possession, and bring the case within the operation of the statute, so
under this, two possessions, as that of the defendant and his tenant, by whom he
held the premises before entering upon them himself, cannot be united so as to
make one continuous possession, and secure to him the beneﬁt of these statutes.
Eds.] The fact that the land was held by the defendant, through a collusive at.
tornmeni, if the plaintiff knew of it and acquiesced, will not take the case out of

the statute. Phillips v. Sampson, 2 Head, 429, 488.

Nor that the defendant's ten

Under the old law, Act 1821, ch. 14, a written complaint was required from
the plaintiff before issuing the writ, specifying either in general or speciﬁc terms,
that the plaintiﬂ" had an estate in the premises. Turner v. Lumbrick, Meigs, 7,

Act of 1842, [drawn into the Codein these sections.] 2 Swan, 41. And the war

must now be stated in the warrant, if necessary under the Act of 1842, to be stated at all. 2 Sneed, 42; 10 Humph. 505-6. It is not now necessary to aver
that the plaintiff has an estate in the prernises ; the averment that he is entitled

to possession is sufficient. 2 Sneed, 42. Nor, even under the old law, was it nec

The premises ought to be described with suﬂicient certainty that the oﬂicer may

the defendant, other than the service of this warrant.

[Ib., § 2.]
Before the Act of 1842, notice to quit was necessary. See Marley v. Rodgers,
§ 5 Yerg. 217. The Act of 1821 did not prescribe the number of day’s notice
the possessor should have, but it was held that he would be entitled to a reason

able notice.

If a tenant refused to surrender possession on the ground of an ad

verse claim, one days’ notice was sufficient. Ib. The above statute dispensing with
notice, applies only to those cases where the possession is made unlawful by the
statute in terms, as in case of renters, lessees, etc., holding over. The notice
must always be given, where the notice itself is necessary to make the holding
unlawful, as where a vendor by parol contract, who has given possession to his
vendcc, determines to rescind the same and recover possession. Sullivan v. Ivey,
§ 2 Sneed, 487, 489. But where a vendee, in by parol contract, repudistes the same,
and refuses to restore possession, no notice to quit is necessary. Chilton v. Nib

lett, 3 Humph. 404.

As to where a party before the Act of 1842, would he en

See as to the policy of the statutes on the subject of forcible entry and detain

not of universal application. It is said that the title may be looked to, to deﬁne
the boundarie; or in view of the question of damages or rents, to be recovered

The Circuit Court cannot ona conviction in a criminal prosecution for forcible
entry and detainer, award a writof possession. The party dispossessed must re
sort to his civil remedy. State v. Walker, 5 Sneed, 259. In executing the writ,
if the defendant does not peaceably yield possession, it is the duty of the oﬁcer
to remove him entirely off the premises. Farnsworth v. Fowler, 1 Swan, 1, 4.
The process is‘not executed, nor the execution complete until the oﬁicer is gone
and the plaintiﬁ‘ left in quiet possession. Ib. If the plaintiff gains possession

under his writ of possession after notice of an injunction, his possession is un
' lawful and he may be expelled by an action of forcible entry and detainer, or the
court issuing the injunction may give relief. Ib.

defendants have been guilty of a forcible entry and detainer, it will he the duty

of the court to dismiss the petition although the proceedings before the justices
are informal or defective, or not conformable to the statute. Childress v. Black,
§ 9 Yerg. 817, 820. The motion to dismiss the certiorari must be made at the re

before the trial.
§ 3363. lf the defendant obtain the certiorari, and, upon the ,,_m,_
trial in the Circuit Court, the jury ﬁnd that the plaintiﬁ' is en
titled to the possession of the land, they shall also ascertain the
value of the rents during the time the plaintiff has been kept
out of possession, and such other damage as the plaintiﬂ' is en
titled to, and the court shall give udgment against the defend
ant and his sureties for the amount. [Ib.]
Before this statute, damages could only be recovered by a separate action on
the certiorari bond, under the Act of 1885, ch. 84. See Hunt v. Dougherty, 3
Sneed, 418. The plaintitf is, under the above section, entitled to such rents and
damages as accrued from the time when the defendant’s possession became un

lawful. Beard v. Bricker, 2 Swan, 50, 68. See Q 3367, and note. Upon dismis
sal of the defendant's certiorari for any cause, the court cannot award a proce
dendo, but must empannel a jury to assess the plaintifs damages under this sec

If the suit was revived in the name of the heir, or real representative,

he would be entitled to recover rents and damages ; if revived in the name of the

§ 3374. Where goods or chattels are wrongfully seized orwsmit 1;",
detained, the owner may institute an action of replevin in the

Circuit Court, against the person so seizing or detaining the
same.

[Act 1845-6, ch. 65, § 1.]

At common law, the action of replevin lies only where the taking amounts to
a trespass. But under the Act of 1845-6, ch. 66, the action will lie in all cases
where the plaintiff has a present right to the possession of any personal property
in the possession of the defendant. Shaddon v. Knott, 2 Swan, 358, 368; Wil

son v. McQueen, 1 Head, 17.

It is asubstitute for detinue, and co-extensive with

it in its application. 2 Swan, 363 ; 1 Head, 18.

The peculiar and distinct object

of this action, is to recover in specie some personal chattel, which has been taken
and detained from the owner’s possession, with damages for detention. McFer
rin v. Perry, 1 Sneed, 314, 316. Sce§ 2749.‘ It does not lie where goods are
taken by process of law, at the suit of the parties against whom the process is
sues; but it may be maintained by strangers to such process. Dearmon v.
Blackburn, 1 Sneed, 390. Except where property which is exempt under the
poor laws, is seized by execution. 1 Head, 1'1. It cannot be maintained against
an oﬂicer by the defendant in the execution, on the ground that the judgment has

been satisﬁed. The remedy is by super-sedeas. Mason v. Nance, 1 Sneed, 178.
See Q 8124, note (J). In one case it was maintained against a United States mar
shal, who had seized goods under aﬁe-ri facias. Berry v. Clements, 9 Yerg. 812.
It lies against husband and wife for goods detained by the wife. Corn v. Bra
zleton, 2 Swan, 278. It lies to recover property sold by the defendant and deliv
ered to the plaintiff, and which the defendant after the sale and delivery forcibly
took and detained. The contract being executed, failure of consideration in such
a case is no defense. Applewhite v. Allen, 8 Humph. 697. Aperson may by
written contract rest the me of a chattel in another, and retain the title in himself.

Ifin such a case, he regains possession of the chattel against the will ofthe donee
of the use, replevin will lie. Woodson v. Pearce, 5 Sneed, 415. Where goods
have been obtained by theft or robbery, neither the felon nor a purchaser from

him can maintain this action to recover possession of them.
§ 3375. The action may be brought in any county in which
the goods and chattels, or any part of them, are, or in which
either of the defendants may be found.
[Ib., 1853-4, ch. 60, § 1.]
And see Q 2819.
§ 3376. The plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall ﬁle with
the clerk of the court an aﬂidavit, sworn to before said clerk,
stating—

' -

§ 1. That, according to the aﬁ"1ant’s information and belief,
the plaintiif is entitled to the possession of the property pro
posed to be replevied, describing it with reasonable certainty;
§ 2. That the defendant has seized, or that he detains the

same ;
§ 3. That said property was not subject to such seizure, de

tention, or execution; and demanding the writ of- replevin.
[Act 1845-6, ch. 65, § 10.]
It‘ separate articles of different quality are sued for, they should be described
with reasonable certainty, and so distinctly as to set them apart from each other,
so that they can be distinguished by proof, and a separate value aﬁixed to each,

so that the jury may separately assess the value of each, or the losing party may
discharge himself from paying the value of any of the articles by returning them.

the value of the property, payable to the defendant, and con
ditioned to be void if the plaintiﬂ' abide by and perform the
judgment of the court in the premises. [Ib., § 2.]
A bond for costs only is no compliance with the above section, and the plaintiﬁ‘

may be ruled to give a new and suﬂicient bond or have his suit dismissed.

Cream

er v. Ford, 1 Heisk. 307. In such a case, where a rule is made for new secu
rity absolutely, the party cannot object that the rule does not give the option to

justify his present security, unless he appear and offer to justify the same. Ib.
See Q 3391, and note. The practice of taking insuﬂicient replevin bonds is strong
ly reprehended in this case. 1 Heisk. 808.
§ 3378. The clerk will value the property according to the of

description in the aﬂidavit, for the purpose of ﬁxing the pen
alty of the bond. [Ib., § 4.]
§ 3379. The writ of replevin will direct the proper oﬁicer to
summon the defendant to answer the plaintiif wherefore he
detains his goods and chattels, describing them as in the aﬁi
davit, and also to take the property out of the possession of
the defendant and deliver the same to the plaintiif. [Ib., § 3.]

§ 3380. Counterparts of the writ of replevin may issue, up
on suggestion of the plaintiif, to any other county, to be executed upon goods, or served upon defendants found in such

county. [Act 1ssa-4, ch. so, § 1;'1845-6, ch. cs, § 5.]
See I 2821, and note.

§ 338]. The court has power to order the issuance of alias '“‘"‘"“'

thereof, as often as may be necessary.

§ 3382. The writ may be executed by seizing the goods or w,-n,|,,,.,
summoning the defendant, at any time before the ﬁrst day ot'”mM'

All the defendants must be summoned, and if any be not served it is error and

ground of reversal to proceed to judgment.

tels sued for, the plaintiﬁ may elect to proceed in case or de
tinue, and then the cause shall be conducted as if the leading
process had been in one of those forms; or, tho plaintiff may
sue out an alias and plnries writ of replevin, in order to get

possession of the goods.

[Ib., § 12.]

In can or ¢Ictinue.—'l‘he original act read in t1-over 0!/detirme. If the pinin
tiff gets possession of ﬂu property, he cannot declare in case or detinue, under
this section. See note to Form 9, page 1251. Where the plnintiﬂ’ so declares, it
is errer to overrule n demurrer for this cause. Nashville Ins. 8: Trust Co. v. Al
exander, 10 Hnmph. 878, 382. But in such a case, where the demurrer was

overruled and the plaintiﬁ‘ afterwards took a nonsuit, it was held not error to
empunnela jury to assess defendant's damages under the statute, [$890.] Ib.

§ 3384. If the‘ otlicer’s return is, that he has taken possession 11.1,,-e,,¢,,,.

of the goods and chattels sued for, but that the defendant is 'mm“d'
not to be found, the plaintiff may sue out an alias and plnries

writ of replevin, directed to the county where the defendant
resides, to have service upon the defendant.

[Act issaa, ch. 60, § 2.]
§ 3385. Should the defendant, or any defendant, be a non-‘I1r°<ll:r£;:1‘;\;il§‘_
resident of the State, the oﬂicer shall return the fact, and the

§ 3388. The defendant may plead not guilty, in which case
all special matter of defence may be given in evidence, or he
may plead specially. [Act 1845-6, ch. 65, §§ 6, 7.]
Eoidmce.—'l‘his provision is noticed in McFerrin v. Perry, 4 Sneed, 814, 816.
Under this plea. it is competent for the party to show that the title to the prop

crty rcplevied is not in the plaintiﬂ, but in himself or in nthird person, and there
by defeat the action. Parham v. Riley, 4 Cold. 5, 9. The plaintiff under the
above statute cannot succeed, unless he prove either a general or a. special prop
erty in himself, and will be defeated if the proof shows that the right to the prop
erty aud possession is in n stranger. 8 Snecd, 816-17. In such u case wherc

both parties claim title through the same person, the one by purchase,‘ the other
by exchange, the dufcndantis not estopped to show that the title is in a third per
son. Ib.-—As to the evidence where a purchaser of property at a. judicial sale sues

in replevin for the recovery of the same, sce Sandford v. Hess, 2 Head, 680.

§ 3380. On the issue being found for the plaintiff, or, in
case of default, upon writ of inquiry, the jury will ascertain

the plaintiﬁ”s damages for the seizure and detention, and judg

[Ib., § 8; 1853-4, ch. 60, § 2.]
To instruct the jury, that if they ﬁnd for the plaintiff, he will be entitled to
recover the property and one centdamages, is error. In such u case the jury are
to ascertain the plaintiﬂ"s damages. Parham v. Riley, 4 Cold. 5, 10.,-'l‘he rule

to others, does not cxtcnd to this action. In such a case, both parties being be
fore the court, the Supreme Court reversed as toboth. Only v. Dickinson, 6 Cold.


See 4 King's Dig., §§ 11,409-11,411 ; supra, Q 2974, and note.

§ 3390. If the issue is found for the defendant, or tho plain

tiﬂ' dismisses or fails to prosecute his suit, the judgment shall
be that the goods be returned to the defendant, or, on failure,
that the defendant recover their value, with interest thereon,

and damages for the detention, the value of the property and
the damages to be assessed by the jury trying the cause, or,
where the plaintiﬁ fails to prosecute, by a jury empzrnclled for
the purpose. [Act 1845-6, ch. 65, § 9.]
Ii‘ the plaintiif dismisses his action, and returns the property to the defendant,
I mere judgment oi‘ dismissal being entered, the same will not be a bur to another
action. Ward v. Mollimr, Brownsville, 1868 ; cited in 4 King's Digest, Q l0,555.
It‘ the property sued for be alike in clmrncter, and not possessed of n separate and

distinct quality, and be so described in the pleadings, a general assessment oi
damages ought to be made. Pickett v. Bridges, 10 Humph. 171. Butwhere sev
eral’ distinct and separate things are replevied, as a horse, "a cow and a mule, the

jury cannot assess in one sum the amalgamated value of the whole, with interest
thereon, but must assess the separate value of each article replevied, with inter
est thereon, as the amount to be paid in case the things be not returned. Ib.
Sayers v. Holmes, 2 Cold. 259, 263. But to enable the jury to do this, the arti
cles must be described so distinctly as to set them apart from each other, so that
they can be distinguished by proof, and a. separate value affixed to each ; they are
then sued for distinctly and separately, and not in gross. Ib. Where the defend

ant succeeds, he is entitled to damages for the detention, whether the property
is returned or not. The return of the property only discharges the judgment for
its value. Haskins v. Everett, 4 Sneed, 581 ; Mayberry v. Cliffe, 7 Cold. 1171
§ 122. Wte measure of damages allowed the defendant for the detention of the

property is discussed, in this last case, and several hypothetical rules stated. 7
Cold. 122, 125. Thejury have a large discretion in the matter of damages. Ib.,
§ 125. The defendant is entitled to an assessment of the value of the property,
according to what it was worth at the time it was taken from him under the writ
of replevin. Ib., 121.
The jury must make a separate assessment of the value of the property and the
damages for the detention; so that the plaiutiﬂ‘ may know what he has to pay as

damages in case he returns the property, and so that he may move for a new trial
if the damages are excessive.

A general verdict for the defendant is error.

ville Ins. & Trust Co. v. Alexander, 10 Humph. 378, 383; 2 Cold. 262. The court
may pronounce judgment for the dcfendant and award execution thereon, for the
damages assessed by the jury for the detention of the property, but cannot award
execution unconditionally for the value of the property replevied; but the judg
ment should be that the goods he returned to theldefeudant, or, on failure of t
pluintiﬂ‘ to restore them, that the defendant recover the assessed value thereo
with interest, and thereupon award execution.

Although the value of the property may exceed the jurisdiction of the Justice,
yet it is in the power of the plaintiff to ﬁx an estimation of value upon it at less
than its real value, and within the jurisdiction of the Justice. But if he docs so,
he is bound by his valuation thus voluntarily made, and if the property is not re
turned to him, he cannot on an appeal to the Circuit Court recover a greater
amount than such valuation, [sud damages for the dct,ention;] nor could he in

any subsequent suit recover the dilerence between such valuation and the actual
ralue of the property.

Gray v. Jones, 1 Head, 542, 545.

But, query, whether in

case the judgment should be in favor of the defmdant on the merits, he would be
concluded by the plaintiﬂ"s valuation, from recovering a judgment against the

plaintiff for a greater valuation, though beyond thejustice’s jurisdiction. lb.

§ 34l0-3414

[Ib.]

§ 6. Or fail to exercise powers conferred by law and essen

The Act of 1845-6, ch. 57, also contained provisions similar to sub-sections 4

and 5, though in different liiiiguage.—See in relation to this proceeding, under
that act, St.-itc v. Merch-.int‘s Insurance and Trust Co., 8 Humph. 235, where the

proceeding at common law is stated, and where the original Act of 1845-6, ch.
§ 57, received construction. The case of the btate v. Scott, 2 Swan, 332, was an
information against aturnpiirecompany, under the Act of 1835, ch. 54, Q 4. The
case ofthe State v. Columbia 8: Hampshire Turnpike Company, 2Sneed, 254, was a.
similar proceeding, but the report does not state under what statute. This case
holds that the information must allege a willful non-feaacnce and misfeasancs

against the corporation in respect of the speciﬁcations and charges relied on as n
forfeiture of the defendant's franchise.

It also holds that the plaintiff cannot

amend in the Supreme Court. But now see Q 2863 ct seq.—The above section
and Q 8423 are noticed in Hyde v. Trewhitt, 7 Cold. 59 ; but there seems to be no
case in our books prosecuted under this chapter of the Code.—See Q 1474, rt uq.;

agers and oﬂicers of a corporation,

or the trustees of funds niiiizpiubit°
given for a public or charitable purpose, to an account for the
management and disposition of property intrusted to their
care; to remove such oﬂicers or trustees on proof of miscon~

Sec Car. Lawsuit, Q 659.—As to the effect of submitting to arbitrators a cause
pending in court, in working a discontinuance, see the cases collected in Heiskell’s
Digest, page 162-3; also Norwood v. Stephens, 7 Cold. 1 ; and Susong v. Jack, 1
H1.-isk. 415. The rule as settled in this last case, in accordance with the dissent

ing opinion in Norwood v. Stephens, is that the submission of a cause pending to
arbitrators without a stipulation that the award is to be made the judgment of the
court is a discontinuance of the suit; and that to have this effect, it is not nec
essary that it be a valid submission, or that there should be a valid award ; but
the voluntary act of submitting the cause to another tribunal is suﬂicient.

A divorce cannot be awarded by arbitrators.
§ 589

Swan v. Harrison, 2 Cold. 534,

§ 3433. The submission may be made by any party in inter- ,, ,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,_

An agent cannot, without express authority, submit his principal's rights to ar

Before this statute, and under the general law, a verbal submission might be
made, and a verbal revocation would have been suﬂicient. Dougherty v. McWhor
ter, 7 Yerg. 239, 257; citing Kyd on Awards. And where the submission had
been made, and the arbitrators chosen by deed in writing anda rule of court

the arbitrators had taken action, change the arbitrators. Cooley v. Dill, 1 Swan,

Evans v. Cheek, 3 Hayw. 42; Mullins v. Arnold, 4 Sneed, 262, 266.

§ 3435. The submission may be of some particular matters ‘(I)1!“:(vil;at a».~_
or demands, or of all demands which one party has against the
'
other, or of all mutual demands.
Before this statute it was held that where a cause pending in court is submit

ted to arbitrators by a rule of court, the arbitrators are clothed with power to
determine, not upon all matters in controversy between the parties, but the mat
ters in controversy in that suit. It is their award as to that which is to be made

the judgmentof the court; and this is the extent of their commission from the
court. But the parties might give them a broader commission and fuller powers,
embracing claims and rights not involved in, or legally capable of being deter.
mined in the pending suit, and an award as to such claims‘ and rights might be
valid and altogether proper, but it would not, as to them,become the judgment
of the court, because notby the court referred to the arbitrators, and not involved

in that with which alone the court has to do—the controversyin the pending suit.
Kincaid v. Smith, 4 Humph. 151, 153. In this case the “ cause " was by consent
submitted to arbitrators. Among the pleas was one of set-oﬂ‘; and the court
held, that the arbitrators could not award a judgment against the plaintiff on this
plea. Ib., 158-4. And in a subsequent suit upon this same award, there being
no averment of any submission beyond the matter in controversy in the former
suit, it was held on demurrer that an action would not lie for the amount awarded
as a set-oft‘. Smith v. Kincaid, 7 Humph. 28. [It would certainly seem that these

decisions could not be maintained under our present statutes of set olf, Qi 2922,
§ 4160, which give the defendant a judgment in the same suit for the excess of his
demand over the plaintiﬁs ; and it would seem clearly the intention of the above see

tion to change the rule of these cases. See Mr. Heiskell’s note, Digest, p. 166;
and Car. Lawsuit Q 871.] Where there was a submission of the matters in regard
to the amount of compensation due from the defendant to the plaintiff, “ and all

§ 3438. Upon such proof or consent, the Judge may, in

the last section, and such order shall have the same force and

Not revocable.

§ 3439. N0 such submission shall be revocable after the
agreement is signed by the parties, or entered of record, with
out leave of the court or Justice, except by mutual consent
entered of record. [Ib., § 2.]
By the general law previous to this statute,‘ the award was revocable until made
a rule of court. This section abrogates the above rule; and it is said by an able

commentator on our law that the agreement may still be produced and proved,
and the order made, notwithstanding the revocation. Car. Lawsuit, § 562. Our
cases before the Code held—That after an award is made and published, the sub

mission cannot be countermanded.

Rogers v. Nall, 6 Humph. 29, 31.

Nor be

fore the _Code, could a submission under seal be revoked except by a writing un
der seal. Evans v. Cheek, 3 Hayw. 42; Mullins v. Arnold, 4 Sneed, 262, 266.

And now since the Code—§§ 1804-1806—places unsealed instruments on the same
footing with those under seal, it would follow by parity of reasoning, and in ac
cordance with 4 Sneed, 266, that where the submission is in writing, it cannot be
revoked by parol.-And before the Codo, n snbmissiouto arbitrators made by

parol could be revoked by parol.

Dougherty v. McWhorter, 7 Yerg. 239, 257.

But a submission cannot now be made by parol. Q 8434.

Unless, perhaps, whore

it is not intended to make the award the judgment of a court, and then the mat
ter would not fall within the provisions of this chapter, and the common law

would govern. See Cur. Lawsuit, § 560; Brown v. Welcker, 1 Cold. 197, 199.
A mere expression by one of the parties of an intention not toabide by the award,
does not amount to a revocation of a parol submission to arbitrators. 1 Cold.
§ 200.

But where the arbitrators of their own accord decline to execute the au

thority conferred on them, this amounts to a revocation, and the parties have a right to be placedlin statu quo. 1 Cold. 201.—As to whether, and when, the dcallr or
marriage of one of the parties, or the death of an arbitrator will have the effect

of revoking the submission, see Car. Lawsuit, Q 662, p. 374, where several au
thorities are quoted.
'

§ 3440. If the time within which the award is to be made is Time of award.
ﬁxed in the submission, no award made after that time shall
have any legal effect, unless made upon a recommitment by
the court; the court may, however, enlarge the time within
which an award is to be made. [Ib.]
This section embodies the doctrine oi‘ White v. Puryear, 10 Ycrg. 441 ; except
the last clause, giving the court power to extend the time within which the award
is to be made.

§ 3441. If the time of ﬁling the award is not ﬁxed in tlrc",1,‘,‘g‘,f‘°b°

submission, it shall be ﬁled within eight months from the time
such submission is signed, unless by mutual consent the time
is prolonged.
This section repeais the rule stated in White v. Puryear, 10 Yerg. 441, 443,
that if there be no time limited in the submission, within which the award is to

be made, the arbitrators may act at any time until their authority is revoked.

§ 3442. The arbitrators shall give notice of the time and ‘Notice amm

plnce of ﬁnal hearing, which notice shall be served at least "8'
ﬁve days before the day of trial.
§ 3443. In allsubmission cases, depositions may be taken 1;.|¢,,,¢._

moned by subpoena, to be issued by the clerk of the court or
Justice, as in other cases. [Act 1851~2, ch. 173, §4.]

and if guilty of false swearing, they are liable to all the penal- t-:'y°:'5-‘M

[Ib.]

§ 3445. Witnesses are also subject to all the penalties pre-wm,e,,,,

cribed by law, for failing to attend and give testimony, in
pursuance of the subpoena, as well as in damages to the party
injured by their default; and, on the other hand, they are en

titled to like privileges and like compensation as other wit

transmitted to the court, and not opened until the court

See Swan v. Harrison, 2 Cold 534, 588, where the provision that the award
must be in writing is applied, and held to be imperative in reference to cases

where the award is to become the judgment of a court.

in part where the mutter omitted may be clearly separated from the matter
_ awarded, and has no dependence upon or connection with it. 2 Swan, 216 ; citing
Stone v. Phillips, 4 Bing. 40.—An award is prime facie ﬁnal ; and tho mm: is
upon him who asserts that it is inconclusive contrary to the terms on its face.

§ 7 Yerg. 252-3.

§ 4. Must be legal. Though arbitrators have a wider range, in the adjustment
of the matter in dispute than could be exercised by :1. court, yet they cannot as a

general rule award anything contrary to law ; for the parties intend to submit to
them only the legal consequences of their transactions and engagements; besides,
to hold otherwise would be to stigmatizc tho law itself. Fain v. Hendrick, 4
Cold. 827, 837. The same doctrine is laid down in more forcible terms in Hale
v. Sharp, 4 Cold. 275, 287; and both of these cases are founded on Haley v.
Long, Peck, 93, 97, where the authorities on this question are reviewed nt length.
The effect of these cases is that the courts will not lend their aid to enforce an

award which is illegal, and contrary to public policy or good morals. But a
mistake in law, if the award is agreeable to equity and good conscience will not
in general be suiiicient to set it aside. 4 Cold. 338; citing Story Eq. Ju., §§
§ 1464, 1455. Unless the arbitrators assume to decide strictly according to law,
and mistake it. Ib., citing the same authorities. And to the same eifect is Del
ver v. Barnes, 1 Taunt. 52, quoted in Peck, 100. For the arbitrators are to de

cide according to their own opinions of equity and conscience, without being tied
down to the observance oi‘ precedents, either of law or equity, or other positive
rules. Jocelyn v. Donnell, Peck, 274.

Choosing arbitrators and they acting within their authority, the award becomes
the act of both parties, and they are estopped by it; and after a long delay and

§ 428-30. For an open removal to another county is not forbidden. Dunn v.

§ 4, 5. Absconuis, or conceals himself or properlg/.—To “ abscond "' in the legal

sense means to hide, conceal or absent one self clandestinaly, with the intent to
avoid legal process. Bennett v. Avant, 2 Sneed, 152.—“ Hath absconded or con

tachment. Conrad v. McGee, 9 Yerg. 428. [This case was decided before the

ca. ea. laws where abolished, and before the attachment law of 1843.

It belongs

to that class of old cases which held that the attachment laws are to be construed

strictly, and is of doubtful authority.--Eds] Our old acts contemplated the pro
cess of attachment against residents who absconded or concealed themselves, so
that the ordinary process of law could not be served upon them. A resident of
mother State concealing himself in this State to avoid service of‘ process, was not

an absconding debtor within the meaning of our old attachment laws. Shngart
v. Orr, 5 Yerg. 192. And see Hodges v. Deadrick, 1 Yerg. 125, 133, where the
expression “ absent debtor " in the Act of 1794, ch. 1, Q 69, was construed with
reference to the other provisions of that Act.—But now seeﬁ 345541, infra.
That the debtor is about to abscond is not a suﬂicient allegation. 2 Sneed, 153.

But an allegation that he is concealirig his property and ejects is suflicient, with
out an allegation that he is absconding or concealing himself. Boyd v. Buckingham,

§ 10 Humph. 484. The removal or concealment of the debtor’s property is, since
the Act of 1843, a substantive ground of attachment. Ib.

Passed January 26, 1871, and took effect from its passage.
The law formerly required one of the parties to be_a citizen of the State. De
catur Bank v. Berry, 8 Humph. 590; Kincaid v. Francis, Cooke, 49, 53; Webb
v. Lea, 6 Yerg. 478; Shugart v. 0rr,5Yerg. 192; Bloomﬁeld v. Hancock, 1 Yerg
§ 101. By the Act of 1851-2, ch. 177, Q 2, the rule was changed, at least so far as
to allow a Justice of the Peace to issue attachments where both parties were non
residents. Hills v. Iazelle, 5 Sneed, 363. And the later statutes and the Code
are understood to extend the remedy to all persons capable of suing, against all
who have property subject to attachment. Heisk. Dig. Q 193.-The above sec

tion restricts attachments against non-residents to cases similar to that which
arose in Shugart v. Orr, 5 Yerg. 192, where a citizen of Virginia was alleged to

be concealing himself in this State so that the ordinary process of law could not
be served on him.

§ 3456. An attachment may, in like manner, be sued outnebunot due,
upon debts or demands not due, in anyof the cases mention

ed in the preceding section except the ﬁrst, when the debtor
or defendant resides out of the State.

[Act 1855-6, eh. 50, §§ 1, 3.]
That is, if the debtor or defendant resides out of the State, and the demand
is not due, the remedy by original attachment cannot be maintained. Smith v.
Foster, 2 Cold. 153, 157.

§ 3457. Any accommodation endorser or surety may, in like Surety.
manner, sue out an attachment against the property of his

principal, as a security for his liability, whether the debt on
which he is bound be due or not.

[Act 1836, ch. 43, § 8.]

This statute does not confer a remedy in favor of an endorser against a prior
endorser; a prior endorser is not a “ principal" within its meaning.

Turner v.

Newman, 7 Humph. 329.
Construing together this section and the two following with the general princi
ples governing acourt of Chancery, it is held that the sureties of a guardian
who has received moneys of his ward, and made no settlement of the same, but
fraudulently conveyed his property, are entitled to an attachment against their
principal without discharging the debt for which they are liable as sureties. How

In ectlons for
torts.

§ 3459 a. In all actions for torts, which may be hereafter
brought in any of the courts of this State, or before any Jus

tice of the Peace having jurisdiction thereof, where the de
fendant or defendants are non-residents of this State, or fall

within any of the provisions of existing laws of this State, au

thorizing attachments to issue, it shall be lawful in such case,
for the plaintiff or plaintiffs to commence such suit by attach

ment in the same way and manner as suits are commenced up

on contracts by existing laws.

Provided, the plaintiff, his,

her or their agent or attorney, shall ﬁrst make aﬂidavit before

the Judge, Clerk, or Justice of the Peace issuing the attach

ment that the damages suedfor are justly due the plaintiff or
plaintiﬁs, as aﬂiant believes, but that the true amount of such

damages are -not ascertained, and that one or more of the caus
es exists for the issuance of said attachment; and provided,
further, that the plaintiff, his, her, or their agent or attorney,
shall give bond with one or more approved securities in double

the supposed amount of said damages claimed, payable to the
defendant or defendants, and conditioned as now provided by
law in attachment cases. [Act 1865-6, ch. 22, § 1.]

of the Judge, Clerk or Justice of the Peace, before whom the
aiﬁdavit is made and bond given, to issue said attachment, re
turnable as in other attachment cases upon contracts. [Ib., § 2.]
Passed February 9, 1866, and took eifect from its passage.
In one case, construing the phraseology of the Act of 1843, ch. 29, Q 1, “ cred
itor or other person entitled to sue,” it was held that there was no restriction as
to the cause of action, and that an attachment lay where the liability was for
damages for the non-performance of a contract. Bunyan v. Morgan, '7 Humph.
§ 210, 219. But in another case, which arose before the Act of 184-3, it was held
that where the action was for a tort which cannot be waived, and raises no im
plied ussumpsit, an attachment in equity would not lie. Union Bank v. Baker,
§ 8 Humph. 447, 450. And in the later case of Thompson v. Carper, ll Humph.

§ 542, it is said that under the Act of 1848, the original attachment is still restrict
ed to causes of action ea: eontractu, where the relation, express or implied, of
debtor and creditor, exists. And this was the understanding of the law until the
adoption of the constitutional amendments of 1866. Gibson v. Carroll, 1 Heisk.
§ 28, 25; Stewart v. Vaughn, 8 Cold. 82; Swan 1. Roberts, 2 Cold. 158, But section 4 of the schedule to the constitutional amendments of 1865, made the
attachment in actions for torts effective without service of process, and gave the

original attachment in such cases.

This provision was in force from the 22d day

of February, 1866, to the 5th day of May, 1870, when the new constitution went
into etfect; by the provisions of which, Art. 11, § 1, the schedule to the consti

tutional amendments of 1865 was abrogated. This provision in the schedule of
§ 1865 received construction in Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 163 ; Boggess v. Gamble,
§ 8 Cold. 148, and Stewart v. Vaughn, 8 Cold. 22.—See note to Q 3463.

§ 447.

An attachment bill ancillary to asuit at law, will not lie under this statute;

but in such a case, if the defendant instead of demurring to the jurisdiction, or
moving to dismiss, require the complainant to elect in which he will proceed, and
he elects to proceed in the chancery suit, the defendant cannot afterwards object
to the jurisdiction. Isaacks v. Edwards, 7 Hnmph. 465.-—In case of an attach
ment in chancery upon a legal demand, if any of the grounds laid in the bill are
untrue, as that the defendant is not about to remove himself or property beyond
the limits of the State, this can only be put in issue by plea in abatement. This
is not a case where the facts which give the court jurisdiction—bcing stated in
the bill and denied in the answer, must be proven. 7 Hnmph. 467. But see note
to} 3476. Under the original act it was held that a prayer for reliefin the bill
is unnecessary ; for the statute points out the mode of relief. Eaton v. Breathell,

§ 8 Hnmph. 584.

Nor need a statement of the indebtedness, if set out in the bill

be repeated in the aﬂidavit to the bill.

§ 3462. Attachments sued out in aid of a suit -already

This section embodies the rule of Fisher v. Cummings, 7 Humph. 232.—An ah

granted.

§ 3463. The attachment may be granted by any Judge of the
Circuit, Criminal or Special Court, by any Chancellor or Jus
tice of the Peace, or by the clerk of the court to which the at~
tachment is made returnable.
Before the Act of 1848, it was held that not even the Court of Chancery had
power to impound the property of a debtor against whom a suit had been oom

rnenced at law, and who was attempting to convey his property beyond the limits
of the State.

Union Bank v. Newman, 4 Humph. 380.

The court, in this case,

said that since the abolishmeut of the capias ad respondemimn, which kept the
person of the defendant within the jurisdiction of the court to satisfy the plain
tiff's claim, there was great danger of fraudulent removals, and a consequent fail
ure of justice, and that the remedy was with the Legislature; and this case prob

ably induced the passage of the ﬁrst and eighth sections of the Act of 1848, ch.
§ 29, which gave the auxiliary attnchment.—An ancillary attachment may, like an
original attachment, be issued by a Justice, returnable to the Circuit Court.

Thompson v. Cooper, 11 Humph. 542, 545; Scott v. White, 1 Thomp. Cas. 38; Q
§ 4125, sub-sec. 1. Until the Act of 1865, ch. 365, Q ll, clerks of courts had no
power to issue attachments. Morris v. Davis, 4 Sneed, 452, 454.—An attachment

will lie in aid of an action ea: deliclo. 11 Humph. 545; followed in 4 Sneed, 452;
Smith v. Foster, 8 Cold, 139; Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 153. In such a case, it
is not necessary that the atﬁdavit should state an indebtedness to a given amount.

ll Humph. 545. All that is necessary is, that both the aﬂidavit and writ of at
tachment show tltat a suit has been commenced by theplainlzfagainst the defend
ant; the nature thereof; the tribunal in which it is pending; the amount of llam
agea laid in the action, and thatlhe cause of action is just. 11 Humph. 545. This
deﬁnition has been quoted in the following cases as embodying the essential re~

quisites of an ancillary attachment, without which it is a nullity.

Morris v. Davis,

§ 4 Sneed, 452; Smith v. Foster, 3 Cold. 139, l45_; Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 158,
§ 157; Woodfolk v. Whitworth, 5 Cold. 561, 564; Gibson v. Carroll, 1 Heisk.
§ 23, 25. And this rule is said to be of equal application, whether the action be

at delicto or ex crmtractu. 3 Cold. 145.

And this was expressly ruled in Wood

folk v. Whitworth, 5 Cold. 561, which was a suit upon a note. And although the
aﬂidavit or petition may state the necessary facts, yet if the writ of attachment

does not, the proceedings will be a nullity. 4 Sneed, 454.

Nor is an attachment

defective in the essential particulars of the above rule cured by the appearance of
the defendant and his pleading to the merits of the principal action. The pro

ceeding being an absolute and complete nullity cannot be waived by the subse
quent proceedings of either party. 5 Cold. 565-6. But see 5 Cold. 688; 3 Hayw.
§ 203.--An ancillary attachment may issue simultaneously with the original su_m
mons. ll Humph. 545; Barber v. Denning, 4 Sneed, 267, 270. And where this
is done, a motion to amend the summons by changing the form of action, is a rec

ognition of the summons as the leading process. Gibson v. Csrrol!, 1 Heisk. 23.
In actions as delécto the summons in such a case is necessarily the foundation of
the suit; otherwise an original attachment would be given in actions ea: delicto,
which, until the oonst. amend. of 1865,was not the law. 4 Sneed, 270 ;1 Heisk. 25.

If summons be not issued, or if issued, abandoned, and the declaration found
ed upon the attachment, it cannot be sustained. 4 Sneed, 270. So, if in such a
case, there be no service of the summons, and if the attachment be void for fail
ing to show that it is ancillary to the suit commenced by summons, a judgment
by default is a nullity. 1 Heisk. 28-25. The only oﬂice of the ancillary attach

ment is to hold the property attached for the satisfaction of the judgment. It
does not bring the party into court. Where service of summons cannot be had,
this may be done in a proper case by a judicial attachment. Ingle v. McCurry,
§ 1 Heisk. 26-28. See § 8466, and note.

§ 3464. The process of attachment issues against the pr0p- Process to any]
erty of the defendant wherever the same may be found.

[Act 1794, ch. 1, §19.]
§ 3465. The oﬂicer granting the attachment may direct, upon coummm

proper application, that counterpart writs of' attachment issue ‘"""'
to any county in which property of the defendant may be

found, or such counterparts may be subsequently applied for
and obtained upon good cause shown.
Formerly the Justice had no power to issue an attachment against the estate,

in his c-mnty, of a debtor residing in another county.
§ 159; Stewart v. Roberts, 1 Yerg. 387,890.

Chambers v. Haley, Peck,

And see Hodges v. Wharton, 1 Yerg.

§ 125; Walker v. Wynne, 8 Yerg. 62.—As to counterpart summons, see {Q 282],
§ 2828.

§ 3466. In any civil action, when the summons has been re-ates;-3%
turned “ Not to be found in my county,” as to all or any one‘ N°"°'""'-’
of thedefendants, residents of the county, the plaintiff may
have an alias and pluries summons for the defendant, or, at
his election, sue out attachment against the estate of -such
defendant. [Ib., § 17 ; 1843, ch. 29, § 1.]

This provision implies that the defendant ls an inhabitant of this State at the
time of the institution of the suit, and that his residence is in the county in which

suit may have been commenced, and that he evades the service of process. In
such case, a judicial attachment may issue against his estate in order to coerce
his appearance. It cannot be of the slightest importance, in view of this remedy,
in what way, or by what artiﬁce the service of process is evaded by the defendant,
whether by concealment in the county of his residence, or in a different county,
or by a change of residence to another State. If he were a resident, and subject
to be served with the ordinary process of law, when the suit was commenced, he
cannot, by a subsequent change of residence, whether for the mere purpose of

evading service, or in good faith, defeat the plaintiffs right to a judicial attach
ment.

James v. Hall, 1 Swan, 297.

Hence, a plea in abatement which alleges

that at the time of the issuance of the judicial attachment, the defendant was not
a resident of this State, is bad in substance; because it does not allege that he

was a non-resident at the time of the commencement ofthe suit.

§ 1 Swan, 297-800.

If the sheriff retum the fact that the defendant resides in another county, a ju
dicial attachment will not lie. Slatton v. Jonson, 4 Hayw. 197. A judicial at
tachment can only be grounded on the precise return presented by the statute.
A return, “ the defendant not found in my county," does not give the court juris
diction to issue the writ. Welch v. Robinson, 10 Humph. 264. The return of
not fo be found implies that the defendant by his own act has put it beyond the
power of the ministerial oﬂicers of the court to serve him personally with process.

The language of the statute imports that after diligent inquiry and search by the
sheriﬂ‘, at the usual residence of the defendant and elsewhere, he is not to be
found; being either actually absent from the county, or having concealed him
self, so as to avoid the service of process. 10 Humph. 266. In Slatton v. Jon
son, 4 Hayw. 197, 200, it is said that the return of non est inventua implies that
the residence of the defendant is in the county, and that the sheriii‘ has been at
his plaoe of abode; and if these are not facts, the return is a false one, and sub

jects the sheriﬂ‘ to an action for a false return.

He should return the truth of

the case, either that the defendant is not an inhabitant of that county, or that he
resides in another—specifying it. lb. [But this case seems to involve an errone
ous deﬁnition of the phrase non cat inuentus. It is generally understood to refer

to a simple return of “ not found.”

See, for the manner of publication, Q 2518-2524.

See also Ingle v. McCurry,

lHeisk. 26, 28, where the mode of procedure by publication under a judicial

void. 1 Heisk. 29.

§ 3468. No judicial attachment shall issue against the estate
of any person residing without the limits of the State, unless
such process is grounded on an original attachment, or unless
the leading process in the suit has been executed on the per
son oi’ the defendant when within the State.

[Act 1794, ch. 1, 5 23.]
This provision has no application whatever to Q 8466.
§ 3469. In order to obtain an attachment, the plaintiff, his “M.,,

agent, or attorney, shall make oath in writing, stating the
nature and amount of the debt or demand, and that it is a
just claim; and, also, that one or more of the causes enume

rated in section 3455 exists.
[Act 1794, ch. 1, § 19; 1838, ch. 166, § 3.]
Requisites of a_ﬂidam'.t.—See Q 3477, and note.—An aﬂidavit stating the cause
for attachment on information and belief, is suﬂicient. Lester v. Cummings, 8
Humph. 386; Bank of Ala. v. Berry, 2 Humph. 443. It must state the nature
of the debt, whether by note, bill of exchange or breach of contract; otherwise
the proceeding will be a mere nullity. Sullivan v. Fugate, 1 Heisk. 20. Thus,
an aﬁidavit that the defendant is indebted to the plaintilf after giving all just
credits, without more, is bad. Moneyhuu v. Tarter, 1 Heisk. 20,_ note. So, an
nllidavit that the defendant was “justly indebted to the pluintiﬂ to the amount

of eighty-one dollars and twenty," was bad.

Forgey v. Anderson, 1 Heisk. 20,

davit, as well as the attachment, must show that fact.

See note to Q 8463.

§ 3470. It is no objection to the attachment, that the bill,

affidavit, or attachment states in the alternative, or otherwise, §Lf&':'.'”'
more than one of the causes for which attachment may be sued‘

This statute supersedes the rule of Conrad v. McGee, 9 Yerg. 428, 480, that
the joinder of two distinct causes of attachment would be fatal. See Smith V.
Foster, 3 Cold. 189.

§ 3471. The ofﬁcer to whom application is made, shall, before mm.
granting the attachment, require the plaintiff, his agent or at

Whemas, A. B. (or G. D., as the agent or attorney of A. B.)
hath complained on oath to me, E. F., Judge, (Chancellor,
Justice of the Peace, or clerk,) that G. H. is justly indebted

(or liable) to the said A. B. in the sum of
dollars *;
and aﬁidavit having also been made in writing, and bond given
as required by law in attachment cases, you are hereby com
manded to attach so much of the estate of the said G. H.
as will be of value suﬁicient to satisfy the debt and costs

according to the complaint; and such estate, unless replevied,
so to secure that the same may be liable to further pro

ceedings thereon to be held at the

§ 2415. No objection will lie to the form of the attachment, Substance.
if the essential matters in the foregoing precedent be set forth
in such attachment.

[Ib., Proviso.]

It will be noticed that the foregoing form is without seal.

By the original

Act of 1794, a seal was required; and an attachment without a seal was void,
and conferred no jurisdiction upon the court. McCullock v. Foster, 4 Yerg. 162;
Walker v. Wynne, 3 Yerg. 62, 71.

Test of the writ.—The Code, Q 2828, provides that all process issued from any
of the Circuit Courts returnable thereto, shall be tested of the term next preceding
the issuance. Notwithstanding this provision, the attestations of the various
forms of process given in the Code, read as though they were intended to be ﬁlled

out with the date of issuance. That this is the proper practice in attachment cases
was the understanding of the court in Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 153, 162. And
if the attachment is tested of the preceding term, an endorsement of the date of is
suqnce on the back, cures the error. 2 Cold. 162. And an error in the test of

process is amendable.

davit and bond are part of the record.

For the aili

If the defect which deprives the court

ofjurisdiction is apparent upon the face of the proceedings, a motion to dismiss
is the proper course. See note to Q 3471. But where the allegation in the aﬁ
davit on which the attachment is based, as that the defendant is a. non-resident,
is untrue, as such a fact docs not appear of record, it is denied by plea in abate

ment.

Foster v. Hall, 4 Humph. 346.

As was done in Slatton v. Brigham, 2

Sneed, 420. The doctrine stated in Cheatham v. Trotter, Peck, 198, 200, that the
afﬂdavit cannot be contradicted for the purpose of defeating the attachment, is a

mere dictum; the rule is settled otherwise.

In attachments in chancery, [Q 8461,

§ 4289,] where itis sought to dispute the allegptions made as ground of attachment,
this must be done by plea in abatement; matter in abatement stated in the an
swer will not Mail on trial of the merits. Isaacks v. Edwards, 7 Humph. 465;
citing Smith v. Story, 1 Humph. 420, which does not sustain the position, but

where the matter in abatement was urged effectively in the answer, and where the
question as to whether this mode of procedure was proper, was not noticed ;—cit
ing also Foster v. Hall, 4 Humph. 346, which is to the point. The same rule is

recognized in Kendrick v. Davis, 3 Cold. 524, 526.

For appearance and pleading

over cures irregularity of process, both at law and in equity. Terril v. Rogers, 3
Hayw. 203, 206. But not void process. Woedfolk v. Whitworth, 5Cold. 561, 566.
See also 5 Cold. 638. A dilferent practice was pursued in Lester v. Cummings, 8
Humph. 885, and Smith v. Story, 1 Humph. 420; but the question of practice is not

noticed in these cases.

Or, a bill showing no grounds of attachment will be dismissed on demurrer.

Fay v. Jones, 1 Head, 442.—-But if the defendant pleads,

and his plea in abatement is overruled or stricken out, it is no waiver of‘the bene
ﬁt of the plea. to plead to the merit. Chambers v. Haley, Peck, 159. And therefore, where judgment goes against the defendant upon his plea to the merits, the
Supreme Court, on appeal in error, will re-examine the whole case, and if satisﬁed
that there is error, will reverse and remand, with directions to reintate the plea.
in abatement and proceed thereon. Ib. Nor is the pleading in abatement to an
attachment an appearance, which gives the court jurisdiction over the defendant’s
person. Boon v. Rabi, 1 Heisk. 12; Friedlander v. Pollock, 5 Cold. 490, 494-5;
contra, Straus v. Weil, 5 Cold. 120, 126. See note to § 2903, on page 1229.

Veriﬁcation of.—Such pleas are not favored, but strictly dealt with, and no in
tendments are allowed to supply defects. They must be veriﬁed by writlen oath,
and a positive form of statement, A statement on information and belief is not
sufﬁcient, and a plea so veriﬁed is a mere nullity. Friedlander v. Pollock, 5 Cold.
§ 490, 495. And see § 2901, and note.—0bjection to a defective plea in abatement

is waived by taking testimony and going to a hearing on the merits. Wilson v.
Eiﬁer, 7 Cold. 31, 33-4.
Conclusion of.-Such a plea, traversing allegations in the aﬂidavit, properly con
cludes to the country.

Boon v. Rahl, 1 Heisk. 12, 14.

When filed.—A plea in abatement is in time when the defendant appears. Har
ris v. Taylor, 3 Sneed, 536. And this is so although there have been a Judg
ment by default, inquiry of damages and ﬁnal judgment._ Chambers v. Haley, Peck,
§ 159.

And in such case, the court cannot impose terms, as to require the defend

ant to plead to the action, instead of pleading in abatement. Roberts v. Stewart,
§ 1 Yerg. 890. Under the'Act of 1794, the defendant was not in court until he had
replevied the property attached. Peck, 159; Boyd v. Buckingham, 10 Hiimph.
§ 484, 487; Judge Cooper's note to Gillespie v. Clark, 1 Tenn. 2. But since the
Act of 1848, the defendant may plead to the action without heingcompelled to re
plevy the property attached; and it is error to refuse to allow him so to plead.
§ 10 Humph. 438-9.

Matter in abaiem.ent.—That the property on which the attachment is levied
does not belong to the defendant, and therefore that he is not before the court.
Harris v. Taylor, 3 Sneed, 536, 539.-That theproperty attached, a slave, was de
coyed from a neighboring State and levied on, in order to give the court jurisdiction.

Timmons v. Garrison, 4 Humph. 148.-Under the old law, 1794, -ch. 1, that the '
plaintiff in a suit against a non-resident was himself a non-resident. Kincaid v.
Francis, Cooke, 49; Webb v. Lea, 6 Yerg. 473 ; Decatur Bank v. Berry, 3

Humph. 590. But this is not now the law. Hills v. Lszelle, 5 Sneed, 363 ;
Q 3455, 3455 a. But a ‘plea to a judicial attachment that the defendant was a
non-resident, is bad, unless it aver that he was a non-resident at the time the at

tachment issued.

[Ala. Code, 1852, § 2562.]

Our old cases adopted the rule of construing the attachment laws strictly.

Wal

ker v. Wynne, 8 Yerg. 62, 71 ; Conrad v. McGee, 9 Yerg. 428 ; Childress v. Dick~

ens, 8 Yerg. 116; Gasqutt v. Scott, 9 Yerg. 244, 247. But this rule of construc
tion was changed by Runyan v. Morgan, 7 Humph. 210, 213, on the ground that
the attachment laws were favorites with the Legislature, and that as often as the

courts had adopted an unfavorable rule of construction the Legislature had chang
ed it. The rule was hence adopted of construing these laws so as to give full
eﬁect to the intention of the Legislature ; and this rule has since been repeated and
illustrated in Lester v. Cummings, 8 Hnmph. 388 ; Burrough v. Brooks, 3 Head,
§ 392; Alexander v. Lisby, 2 Swan, 107 ; Scott v. White, 1 Thomp. Cas. 88; Vance
v. Cooper, 2 Cold. 498 ; Swan v. Roberts, 2 Cold. 153; Smith v. Foster, 3 Cold.
§ 189; Friedlander v. Pollock, 5 Cold. 491; Brooks v. Hartman, 1 Heisk. 36, and

perhaps others.

The change dates from the Act of 1848, ch. 29, the evident policy

of which was to give creditors an enlarged remedy by attachment in place of the
remedy they had lost in the abolishment of the ca. aa. laws. See Maples v. Tun
is, 11 Hnmph. 108, 110; Boyd v. Buckingham, 10 Hnmph. -434. The former
case, decided after the Act of 1843, recognized the policy of adhering to the rule

of strict construction in a case arising before it. And whether the design be to
aﬂbrd a remedy to the plaintiff, or to protect the defendant against injustice and

wrong, the same liberal construction must prevail.

Smith v. Foster, 3 Cold. 139,

§ 143. There are however, some cases whieh, perhaps, tend the other way; such
as McReynolds v. Neal, 8 Humph. 12. Ifthe aﬂidavit do not state a suﬂident
cause for attachment, it will be quashed on motion. Bennett v. Avant, 2 Sneed,

§ 152.

Or may be abated on plea. Q 3476.

Or, as Mr. Hciskell suggests, Dig., Q

§ 196, quashed on demurrer ; for the aﬁidavit is, under Q 3472,'part of the record.
And in chancery an attachment bill showing no grounds for the issuance of an at
tachment, will be dismissed on demurrer. Fay v. Jones, 1 Head, 443.

Aﬂdavit defective, proceeding void.--If the aﬂidavit do not exhibit suﬂicient
ground of attachment, the whole proceeding is void, and the judgment a nullity.
Hodges v. Wharton, 1 Yerg. 125 ; Conrad v. McGee, 9 Yerg. 428 ; Maples v. Tunis,
ll Hnmph. 108 ; Sullivan v. Fugate, 1 Heisk. 20.—And a sale of realty under such
ajudgment passes no title. 9 Yerg. 428 ; 11 Hnmph. 108. And this is so, al
though the writ of attachment be good in form, and recite that the proper

aﬂidavit was made; for the aﬂidavit is required to be made a part of the record,
[Q 3472,] and is the basis of the suit. 11 Hnmph. 109-10. But an amendment
to a defecliqa aﬂidavit should be permitted. 11 Humph. 111. Thus, an aﬁidavit,
sworn to, but which the plaintiff had omitted by mistake to sign, is amendable.
Scott v.‘ White, 1 Thomp. Cas. 88. But where there is no aﬂidavit, it is not error
to refuse to allow one to be made by way of amendment. McReynolds v. Neal,
§ 8 Humph. 12. This rule “ results as a corrollary not only from the positive rc
quirement of the statute, but from almost every decision ever made by this court
on the subject of attachments, and is too clear for argument.” Ib.
B<md.—The bond to an attachment bill in equity is amendable. Alexander v.
Lisby, 2 Swan, 107. The case of The Bank v. Fitzpatrick, 4 Humph. 311, is said
not to deny the propriety of making such an amendment, but tacitly admits it. Ib.
A bond signed by the ﬁrm name of the parties complainant, instead of their names
individually, is, since the abolishment of private seals by Q 1804, a good bond,
and binding on the ﬁrm, but if not a good bond, it would be amendable under
this section, and the amendment would not postpone the lien of the attachment.
Brooks v. Hartman, 1 Heisk. 36, 39. Unless the motion to amend a defective
attachment bond is made in the court below, it will not be heard in the Supreme

Court. Bank v. Fitzpatrick, 4 Humph. 311. As to requisites of be/mi, and rem
edy in case of defective bond, see Q 3471, and note.
Eject of Amendment.—An amendment in an attachment case operates only
from its date. Lillard v. Porter, 2 Head, 177, 179. But the amendment of a defective bond does not postpone the lien of an attachment to the date of the amend

See Q 3907, and note.

Waiver of errors.-—By appearance and confession of judgment a party waives
objection to a defective attachment. Hearn v. Crutcher, 4 Yerg. 461, 474." And

after the principal defendant has thus lost the right to object, a garnishee cannot
object. Ib.
§ 3478. Where property, choses in action, or effects of the

debtor are in the hands of third persons, or third persons are
indebted to such debtor, the attachment may be by garnish

ment. [Act 1794, ch. 1, § 22.]
And see the deﬁnition in § 8097, which was probably intended to apply to this
article.

“ P1-operty.”—'I'he provisions of this article are evidently intended to repeal
the rule of McMinn v. Hall, 2 Tenn. 328, that a person whose contract is to pay

speciﬁc property cannot be made liable as garnishee.

Thus, moneys as well as

other property in the possession or under the control of the garnishee are, under

Q3090, 3097, gamishable. McGraw v. Memphis 81: Ohio R. R. Co., 5 Cold. 434,
§ 487. And see Miller v. McClain, 10 Yerg. 246; Barrett v. Thomas, 1 Thomp.
Cas. 67.

Q 8496, and no_te.—Judgments. Hoard v. Casey, 4 Sneed, 178. But a judgment

in the Circuit Court cannot be reached by garnishment in a proceeding before a

Justice. Glodfelter v. Cox, 1 Sneed, 330, 839-41. Bee Q B097. And see Cqpn v_
Allen, 3 Head, 418. Money in hands of ofﬁccrs, when, and when not. See noto
to Q 8097; Puwley v. Gains, 1 Tenn. 208. If the money is held for the satisfac
tion of a judgment, it cannot be taken in garnishment. 1 Tenn. 208. But where
a sheriff has collcctcd a clerk’s fees from year to year, and advanced the clerk
some of the money, for which he has taken the notes of the clerk, and then has

taken n deed of trust, he holds the proceeds, if his claim be satisﬁed, as a debtor,
and is subject to garnishment. Hearn v. Crutcher, 4 Yerg. 461, 475.—Nor are
salaries of public otﬁcers subject to garnishment.

Bank of Tenn. v. Dibrell, 8

Sneed, 879, 883.—Dcbt not due.—See Q 3480, and note; @3485.

And so the

garnishee may, after service of garnishment, purchase property of the debtor, and
pay for it without charging himself. Davenport v. Swan, 9 Humph. 186. If the
garnishec answer that he holds property of the debtor, but that the same is not
subject to execution, he must be discharged. lb. If the debt is contingent, no judg
ment can be rendered against the gamishee. Grace v. Maxwell, 6 Humph. 828;

Turner v. Armstrong, 9 Yerg. 412.

Redemption mmteytendered, on bill ﬁled to

enforce redemption, is in cu-stodia legis, and although not paid into court, not sub

ject to garnishment

Kildrew v. Elliott, 8 Humph. 515.

A partnership debt can

not be impounded in this way to satisfy the individual liability of a partner. John
son v. King, 6 Huhiph. 233. But in equity an individual debt can be attached to
satisfy a ﬁrm liability. Boyd v. Bayliss, 4 Humph. 886.

§ 3479. Attachment by garnishment is effected by inform- §&1;§,{,=_t
ing the debtor of the defendant, or person holding the proper
ty of the defendant, that the property in his hands is attached,

and by leaving with him a written notice that he is required
to appear at the return term of the attachment, or before a
Justice of the Peace at a time and place ﬁxed, to answer such
questions as may be asked him touching the property and
effects of the defendant. [Ib., § 22 ;’ 1815, ch. 20.]
See as to the nature of the proceeding by garnishment, note to Q 8087. The
garnishment notice is issued by the oﬂicer having the attachment to execute.
The clerk of the court cannot issue it. Hogshead v. Carruth, 5 Yerg. 227, 229.
See Heisk. Dig., Q 207. But if issued by the clerk, the appearance and answer of

the garnishee is a waiver of the defect, “ ifit be one. "

thereafter in his custody or under his control, to answer the

Debts not due.-—Bef0re the Code debts not due were held not subject to garnish

§ 3484. If it appears that the garnishee is indebted to the
defendant, or has property and effects of the defendant, subject
to the attachment, the court may, in case recovery is had by

the plaintiff against the defendant, give judgment against the
garnishee for the amount of the recovery, or of the indebted
ness and property. [Act 1794, ch. 1, § 22.]
The liability of the garnishee depends upon that of the principal debtor. Hearn
v. Crutcher, 4 Yerg. 461, 474. And no judgment can be rendered against the
garnishee, until a judgment has been rendered against the principal debtor ; other
wise there might be a sequestration of the defendant's goods in the gamishee's
hands, when he owed the attaching plaintiﬂ nothing. Seawall v. Murphy,
Cooke, 478.

§ 1"“ '1“ °“*-‘-

§ 3486. If, when duly summoned, the garnishee fail to appear
and answer the garnishment, he shall be presumed to be in

debted to the defendant to the full amount of the plaintiﬁ’s
demand, and a conditional judgment shall be entered up against
him accordingly. [Act 1794, ch. 1 § 22.]

§ 3487. Upon this conditional judgment, a scire facias shall
issue to the garuishee, returnable to the next term of the court,
or to a day and place ﬁxed before a Justice, to show cause why

ﬁnal judgment should not be entered against him.
[Act 1794, ch. 1, § 22.]
Sec§ 3091, and not-e.—GamiaItee’s defe1urea.—See note to Q 3103, p. 1828.
Whether the garnishee may defend by pleading in abatement, or otherwise object
to the suﬂiciency of the attachment, seems not well settled. It is said he cannot
plead in abatement to the attachment. Cheatham v. Trotter, Peck, 198. Nor

can he object to the attachment after the principal debtor has confessed judg
ment. Hearn v. Crutcher, 4 Yerg. 461, 476. [For by confessing judgment the
principal debtor releases errors, Q 3107, and the garnlshee could not stand in a


better position than his principal] Mr. Heiskell thinks that the garuishee would
be entitled to such a defense; otherwise a judgment might be rendered against
him upon a writ which might afterwards he quashed upon appearance and plea of
defendant. Heisk. Dig. Q 209, note. And this view is supported by Woodfolk v.
Whitworth, 6 Cold. 561, 566, which holds that where a garnishee submits to an

swers. gamishment on an attachment which is void, he will not be protected against
a future claim on the part of the principal defendant. And see 1 8498, and note.
But the garnishee cannot insist upon matter exclusively for the beneﬁt of the de
fendant debtor. Peck, 200. But the principal debtor may have a sttpdrsedeaa to

quash an execution issued against the garnishee. Baldwin v. Campell, 8 Humph.
§ 132, 189. But he cannot appeal from a judgment rendered against the garnishee.
' Atnip v. Gilbert, 1 Thomp. Gas. 181. An appearance and answer is awaiver of
any defect in the notice of garnishment. 4 Yerg. 475.
Garni.sItee’s eqm'ti.a.—The garnishee may show in his own favor that the prop
erty in his hands was transferred to him by the debtor for his indemnity. Nolen

v. Crook, 5 Humph. 812.

Or that although he owes the debtor, yet that the

debtor owes him a larger amount. Arledge v. Whit/e,l Head, 241. And where
the garnishee holds merchandise of the principal debtor placed in his hands for
sale, and theprincipal debtor owes the garnishee, the garnishee is entitled to :1 prior
satisfaction ofhis debt out of the propertyheld byhim. Fain v. Jones, 8 Head, 308.

And so an executor will be permitted to retain a legacy to satisfy his own debt due
from the legatee in preference to a creditor of the legatee seeking to attach the
legacy. Fay v. Reagan, 2 Sneed, 200.

And where a distributee or heir has been

advanced, the advancements must be collated and brought into contribution.be
fore they can be subjected to the demands of an attaching creditor of such heir
or distributee. Johnson v. Hoyle, 3 Head. 66. But where an absconding debtor
deposits a note with a creditor without assigning it to him, the note may be at

tached by another creditor of the absconding debtor, and the depositary cannot
hold it against the attachment. Davis v. Clayton, IS Humph. 446. l And so where
a creditor has executed a note in favor of his debtor who is a non-resident, and
the note is in the hands of an agent within the jurisdiction of the court, it may
be attached. But if the non-resident had with him the note, nothing could be

done. Boyd v. Bayless, 4 Humph. B86.

§ 3488. Upon the return of this scire facias duly served, or gléir,a:_Judg

§ 3493. The judgment in the garnishment suit, condemning
the property or debt 111 the hands of the garnishee to the sat

garnishee and defendant.
See alsoé 3099.—Il' the garnishee answer truly and fully, and upon his an
swer a valid judgment is rendered against him, this will protect him. Daniel v.

Rawlings, 6 Humph. 403.

But if the garnishee conceal or omit to disclose a. fact

which would protect him from the judgment, such judgment against him as gar
nishee will not protect him against the principal defendant, his creditor. Connor
v. Allen, 3 Head, 418, 422. And where the garnishee was indebted to the prin

cipnl debtor by note for one hundred dollars dischargeable in two thousand pounds
of bar iron, to be delivered by a given day, and the iron was not delivered as
speciﬁed, and afterwards, upon answer as garuishee he stated that he owed the

principal defendant two thousand pounds of iron, which was thereupon con
demned and sold—it was held that this answer did not discharge him from his
liability; as the money, and not the iron was due the principal

placed them in the hands of an attorney for collection, and afterwards assigned
them to a third party, and a pa-rty who had procured a void judgment against the

payee, and who also had knowledge of the assignment of the notes, garnished the
attorney, and out of the fund in ‘his hands procured satisfaction of his void judg
ment ; it was held that the assignee ofthc notes mightin equity recover hack from

§ 1. Because the garnishment proceeding was based upon a void judgment,,and
was hence a nullity ;
§ 2. Because having previous knowledge of the assignment of the notes, the gar
nishing creditor perpetrated a fraud upon the assiguee. Haynes v. Gates, 2 Head,
§ 538.

§ 3494. The garnishee against whom a judgment for money

is rendered by a Justice of the Peace, is entitled to the stay oi
execution allowed by law on Justice’s judgments.
[Act 1851-2, ch. 177, § 1.]
§ 3495. The garnishee shall not be made liable upon a debt
due by negotiable or assignable paper. unless such paper is
delivered, or the garnishee completely exonerated or indemni-

ﬁed from all liability thereon, after he may have satisﬁed the
judgment or decree.
The Supreme Court examined with solicitude to see if they could except debts
founded on negotiable paper out of the general laws relating to garnishment, but
the acts having made no exceptions, the court could make none. Hightowcr v.
Smith, 7 Yerg. 44, note. Huff v. Mills, 7 Yerg. 42, 44 ; Turner v. Armstrong, 9
Yerg. 412, 413. But the courts appear to have guarded against any incon
venience in practice by requiring the answer of the garnishee to show that the
paper is still in the hands of the principal debtor. Tumer v. Armstrong, 9 Yerg.

§ 412, 418; Daniel v. Rawlings, 6 Humph. 408, 405.

Thus, if the garnishee answer

that he became indebted by the execution of negotiable paper, but does not know

in whose hands it is, he must be discharged. 9 Yerg. 418; 6 Humph. 403; 6
Yerg. 43.

But if it appear by his answer that the paper had not been assigned

before dishonor, and that he was indebted at the time the garnishment was
served upon him, hewill be charged. 6 Humph. 403.

And so where the answer

shows that the negotiable instrument has been put in suit by the principal debtor,
creditor of the garnishee, the gas-nishee will be charged. 7 Yerg. 44.

also used without qualiﬁcation.
the Code, see Q 51.

For a deﬁnition of the word property, as used in

An attachment may be levied.—Upon an equitable interest ; but to reach it,
the bill must seek toattach it as an equity, state the nature of the title, and make
the holder of the legal title a party. Lane v. Marshall, 1 Heisk. 80. An attach
ment upon land, as the property of the defendant, will be intended to attach a le

gal interest, and if he has only an equity, n sale under it will convey no title. lb.
An equitable estate is not subject to attachment at law. Ib. It may be levied
upon an estate in remainder of real or personal property. Lockwood v. Nye, 2
Swan, 5l5.—Upon the property of a turnpike or railroad company on which the
State has a lien, when. F. & C. Turnpike Co. v. Young, 8 Humph. 108, 106;
State v. La Grange tit Memphis Railroad company, 4 Humph. 488.

Au attachment mrmot be lavied.—0n property of a debtor held by a creditor for
his own indemnity.

Fain v. Jones, 8 Head, 808.

Nor on personalty conveyed

in trust, and then before attachment issued, sold subject to the trust. Williams
v. Whipple, 1 Head, 401.-Nor on land purchased by parol contract. Sneed v.
Bradley, 4 Sneed, 801, 805.

Nor on the land in such a case, after the psrol

purchaser had sold to another to whom the vendor had made a deed. lb.

But

_ in such s case, an attachment in equity of both land and fund would have reached

one or the other. Ib. Nor can an attachment be levied upon land held by title
bond after the equitable owner has transferred his right by assignment and deliv
ery of the title bond without registration. Robinson v. Williams, 8 Head, 540.
And see Fleming v. Martin, 8 Head, 48, 51.—-Or where the parol purchaser has

sold by parol, and his veudee has been substituted to his place in the contract.
Wood v. Thomas, 2 Head, 161.

Or where the sale was in writing, but had been

rescinded in good faith by parol, or writing unregistered. 2 Head, 48.

But not if

the rescission were merely a fraudulent transfer for the beneﬁt of the vendee, and

to injure his creditors. Ib.

And where land has been sold by parol, and there has

been a decree in equity divesting title, the land cnnnot be attached as the property

of the vendor, although the decree may have been erroneous. Thacker v. Cham
bers, 5 Humph. 818.--An attachment cannot be levied on property decoyed out
of another State into this State for the purpose of giving the court jurisdiction.
Timmons v. Garrison, 4 llumph. l48.—But see Cate and Davidson’s case, cited by
Mr. Heiskell, Dig., p. 198.—Nor upon corporation property in a suit against the
stockholders. Lillard v. Porter, 2 Head, 177.

Successive attachments should be levied in the order in which they come into the
oiliccr’s hands.

Lea v. Maxwell, I Head, 865, 869.

In such a case, if the sheriff

has failed to make a return as to one of the parties where attachment was levied,
his rights will not be prejudiced thereby, but he will be entitled to his pro mta

in the distribution of the proceeds. Ib.
Good without 1'etnm.—Where a levy is made, a creditor’s rights under it are
not dependent on the sheriff's return. 1 Head, 868.

court or Justice before whom the suit is pending, unless replev

§ 8505. If any or all of the property is of so perishable awm by
nature, orso expensive, as to render a sale necessary for the in- om."
terest of the parties, before the oﬂicer can make his return, he
may sell the same, upon advertisement as in the case of execu

tion sales, and make return of the facts with the proceeds of
sale.
§ 3506. Money attached by the oﬂicer, or coming to his grpggegss

hands by virtue of the attachment, shall forthwith be paid over
to the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending, to be by
him retained until the further action of the court.
§ 3507. Any transfer, sale or assignment, made after the 

ﬁling of an attachment bill in Chancery, or after the suing out "m'°"'
of an attachment at law, of property mentioned in the bill or
attachment, as against the plaintiff, shall be inoperative and

void.

[Act 1836, ch. 43,§ 9.]

An attachment under our law is a. proceeding in perscmam and not in rem.
Its object is to compel the appearance of the debtor and security for the debt. If
the property be replevied, security must be given for the debt, or for the value
of the property attached. If not, it reinsiusin the custody of the law for the sat
isfaction of the judgment to be obtained on execution. The levy of attachment
does not divest the property of the debtor; it merely creates a speciﬁc lien upon

the property attached; and if he die pending the suit the property passes, subject
to the lien, to his representatives, real or personal. Snell v. Allen, 1 Swan, 208,
§ 111; Green v. Shaver, 8 Humph. 139, 141; Perkins v. Norvell, 6 Humph. 151,
§ 158; Boggess v. Gamble, 8 Cold. 148, 154. The property attached cannot be

sold until after the personal judgment against the debtor. After judgment the
plaintiﬁ‘ has a right to sue out a writ of vmditioni czponas to sell the property
held bound by the lien of the attachment; or he may resort to the ordinary writ

ofﬁe:-1' facias, and cause it to be levied on the property attached, or other prop
erty of the defendant, if to be found.

§ 1 Swan, 211 ; 6 Humph. 168; 8 Cold. 154.

But the election to take a writ ofﬁeri facial is a waiver of the lien of the attach
ment. l Swan, 211; Seawall v. Jones, 2 Tenn. 278. And see Judge Cooper's
note, 1 Tenn. 85, Cooper‘s Ed. If the defendant die pending the suit, it must be

revived against the personal representative in order that a judgment may be ren
dered and the personalty reached, and if realty be attached, it must be revived
against the heirs also. For they would have a right to require that the judgment
should be satisﬁed out of the personalty, and must be brought before the court that

they may see that the personal assets have been fully administered. 8 Humph. 141 ;
Stockard v. Pinkard, 6 Humph. 119. And after a judgment obtained against the
personal representative, the plaintiff maydiave scire faciaa against the heirs re
quiring them to show cause why he should not have satisfaction out of the land
attached; and if the heirs fail to show personal assets in the hands of the admin
istrator, or anything else in defense, the land will be ordered to be sold. 6 Humph.
§ 151-4. And a sale without such a proceeding against the heirs is void. Stock
ard v. Pinkard, 6 Humph. 119.—See as to the various modes of procedure against
the estates of decedents for the satisfaction of debts, Q 2257, and note; § 2268,
ct seq., and note; Q 2267, at seq., and notes; 1 2825 ct seq.; § 2362 at seq.
The levy of an attach ment ﬁxes a special lien upon the property attached, which
if the property be not released therefrom by replevy, is continued and made effect
ual by the judgment of condemnation, and sale under the writ of vcndiiioni cz

ponas. This lien is no less operative to defeat an unregistered deed than the lien
of a judgment or execution; and it will hold wherever the latter would take ef
fect. Harvey v. Champion, 11 Humph. 669. This case overrules Vinson v. Hud
dleston, Cooke, 254 ; Alexander v. Bland, Cooke, 431, and Lemmon v. Alexan

der, 1 Tenn. 84-—cases which arose before the registration act of l881.—See Q}
§ 2072, 2075, and notes; Q 2980 at seq., and notes.
The object of the 9th section of the Act of 1836, ch. 43, carried into the above
section and enlarged so as to apply to attachments at law, was to prevent the
debtor from evading the attachment after the bill had been ﬁled, and before the

levy, by sales or transfers of his estate. Burroughs v.Brooks, 3 Head, 892, 894.
Under this act, a conveyance made after bill ﬁled, is void as against the complain
ants. Ib. But this rule only extends to a conveyance of the “ property " men
tioned in the bill or attachment. Lacey v. Moore, 6 Cold. 848 ; Vance v. Cooper,
§ 2 Heisk. 98, overruling on rehearing, same case, 2 Cold. 497-4: decision inadver

tently published after a rehearing had been granted.

The same rule is recog

nized in Sharp v. Hunter, 7 Cold. 889, 394. In allother cases, the lien of an attach
ment takes effect from the date of thelevy. 6 Cold. 853 ; ll Humph. 569. And

this is the general law in other States of the Union.

Drake on Attachments, Q

§ 221. And this lien will overreach the lien of a judgment rendered subsequent to
the levy, although founded upon a summons issued and executed before the levy.

Tappan v. Harrison, 2 Humph. 172.
The evil sought to be remedied by this section of the Code was the surrepti
tious transfer of the title to property while the creditor was actually prosecuting
his remedies against the debtor. Sharp v. Hunter, 7 Cold. 889, 396. This soction does not, like Qt 4288-4286, give a lien expressly from the ﬁling of the bill;

and it is hence held that in cases falling under this section, that ia, attachments
at law, or attachments in equity upona legal demand, [Q 3461,]—no lien attaches

until the levy ofattachment; but the suit from its commencement operates as a
liapendens, during which any alienations of the property mentioned in the bill are

void as against the attaching creditor. Ib.

But where there has been a. bomlﬁde

sale of the property mentioned in the bill before the ﬁling of the bill, without be

ing properly registered, this section will not prevent the purchaser from proving
and registering his deed in the manner prescribed by law, and thereby perfecting

his title. Ib.
§ 77w lien of an attachment is loat
l. By-the lachea of the plaintiﬂ‘ in failing to take out ﬁnal process on his judg
ment.

Thus, a delay of seven months after judgment before a Justice of the

Peace, was held to be an abandonment of the levy and a waiver of the lien.
Snell v. Allen, 1 Swan, 108, 111.

§ 2. By taking out ﬁeri facia-t instead of ecndilioni ezponas.

Thus, it is said ar

yuendo in one case that the plaintiﬂ‘ may, at his election, take out either anor
der of sale, or the common writ ofﬁeri faeias, and if he elect to take out the.‘

latter, it releases the property attached.

And this dictum is quoted in Snell v.

Allen, 1 Swan, 108, 111; but the question seems never directly to have arisen.
§ 8. By any act which indicates a clear intention to abandon the levy. See
Brown v. Allen, 8 Head, 429, where the levy was of an execution, but which is

instructive on this point.

But the lien of an attachment will not be lost by the

failure of the sheriffto make return.

Lea v. Maxwell, 1 Head, 365.

‘

An amendment will not operate by relation so as to give effect to the lien of
nnattachment from the levy, but only from the date of the amendment.

Under the Act of 1794, the defendant could not plead until he had replevied the
property attached ; for the replevy bond operated as special bail. But the Act
of 1848, ch. 29, following the abolishment of the ca. sa. laws, changed the policy
of the law on this subject, and now it is not necessary for the defendant to ro
plevy before he can plead. Boyd v. Buckingham, 10 Humph. 434.—As to the

any fault of the defendant, after the replevy, is no defence to

Where the property of several joint defendants is attached, and, after replevy,
the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses as to one of the defendants, this discharges the
hsureties in the replevy bond. Harris v. Taylor, 8 Sneed, 538, 541.--The surety in
a replevy bond is bound by the result of the litigation; and he is bound by an

agreement between his principal and the plaintiff for the supplying of lost papers
on defective sfhdavits. Wells v. Grithn, 2 Head, 688.

time and place at which the defendant is required to appear

[Act 1836, ch. 43, § 5.]

A publication not containing the requisites of the above section would give
the court no jurisdiction of a judicial attachment, and a judgment by default

The Act of 1794, ch. 1, required that a lapse of six months should take place
from the date of the return before ﬁnal judgment could be rendered against a
non-resident debtor. Nevertheless a judgment rendered within that time, though
irregular and erroneous, was not void ; and if real estate were sold under such a
judgment, the purchaser would get a good title.

Porter v. Porter, 7 Humph.

§ 3530. In all other cases of judgment or decree by default,
the defendant cannot deny or put in issue the ground upon

recover such damages as he has actually sustained for wrong

fully suing out the attachment.
Do these sections, 3529, 8580, modify the rules of pro

cedure laid down in Chambers v. Haley, Peck, 159, and Roberts Y. Stewart, 1 Yerg.
§ 890, that the defendant may ﬁle a plea in abatement whenever he appears, [and
under the old law replevies,] even after judgment by default and writ of inquiry

executed, Peck, 159; and that a judgment by default will be set aside without
terms to allow him to plead, 1 Yerg. 390? Heisk. Dig., §_205.—And see note to
Q 3476; note to Q 3509.—By the provisions of these two sections, in a case

where the defendant is described in the bill as a non-residevit debtor, he may, with
in twelve months, appear and set aside the judgment on good cause shown; but
where the issuance of the attachment is based on the ground that he is an
absconding debtor, he is precluded, and he can only sue on the bond.

v. Arnold, 4 Cold. 864, 367.

Patterson

A person who has been proceeded against as

abscoiiding debtor, by attachment bill, publication, pro confuse and ﬁnal decree,

cannot, without showing that he was precluded by accident, surprise or mistake,
re-open the cause by writ of error comm nobio. Ib.

That is, the court will only

look to the cause stated in the aﬁidiivit, [or bill.]

Thus, if the attachment be

sued out solely on the ground that the defendant is a non~resident debtor, the

motion to set aside the judgment cannot be entertained. But where there are
several causes of attachment stated in the alternative, [Q 8470,] the success of
the motion must depend up'on the cause of action which is true. Smith v. Foster,
§ 8 Cold. 139, 143. The application may be by petition or motion supported by

aﬂidavits.

§ 8 Cold. 144; Sneed v. Hall, Ib., 255, 264.

The affidavits are only

part of the record so as to be available in the Supreme Court, when made so by

bill of exceptions; and it is the duty of the Circuit Judge to sign a bill of excep
tions embodying such aiﬁdavits, and where he refuses to do so, the Supreme Court

will compel him to do so by mandamus. Ib.—Such a judgment may be set aside
as to some of the defendants, and remain in force as to others.

[Act 1857-8, ch. 52, § 3.]
Under the original Act of 1825, ch. 21, the landlord had no right in the crop,

and could maintain no action grounded on any taking of or detaining of it, or in
jury to it. Hardeman v. Shumate, Meigs, 898, 402. The lien was a mere right
of priority of payment which could not be injured by a conversion of the property,

and was only lost by the laches of the landlord. Sec Mr. Meigs‘ note, Meigs' R.
§ 403. Hence a landlord could not maintain suit against a purchaser of the crop,
until he had first recovered judgment against the tenant. Ballantyne v. Green, 6
Yerg. 267; Lawrence v. Jenkins, 7 Yerg. 494. And even then, after recovering
judgment against the tenant, he could not maintain an action against one who
had purchased the crop from the tenant, alt/tough with notice of the lien. Bryan
v. Buckholder, 8 Humph. 561 ; citing and approving Hardeman v. Shumate, ut
W/rra, and Mr. Meigs' note above quoted. The sumc ruling was made in an ear

licr case, but there the purchaser of the crop did not know that the seller was a
renter. Davis v. Parks, 6 Yerg. 252. The rule declared in thecase in Helga was,
that the landlord's lien for rent is entitled to precedence out of the crop over all other debts of the tenant, and this precedence is preserved by bringing suit for
the debt, within three months after the debt falls due, and prosecutingit to judg
ment—the lien of which judgment, and of the execution thereon, takes effect from
the day the rent fa1ls'due.

Meigs, 402.

As against the landlord's lien for rent,

no portion of the crop is exempt under the poor laws.

see may have paid his landlord for his rent. 4 Yerg. 45B.—The case of Broyles
v. Lowrey, 2 Sneed, 22, was not a. case under the statutes giving the landlord a

lien, but a case where the landlord after selling his share of the crop to the ten
ant went upon the premises and distrained it.--The court of ehanczry has jurisdic»
to enforce by attachment a landlord’s lien for rent, especially where it is alleged
in the bill that the defendants are intending fraudulently to dispose of the crop,
to defeat the complainant’s right to rent. Sharp v. Fields, 1 Heisk. 671. In such
a ease, a charge in the bill that the defendants were occupying lands at the death

of the tenant for life, and that complainant permitted them to remain after the
death, and is entitled as owner, to one thirdof the crops as rent, is asuﬂicient
charge of indebtedness to support an attachment for rent.

And a bill charging

that the title of a former owner of land i&c siniple “has been vested in the
complainant by operation of law,” sufficiently alleges that he has title. Ib.

The attachment is the only mode provided by law for the enforcement of the
mechanic's lien. Barnes v. Thompson, 2 Swan, 318, 317 ; Brown v. Brown, 2
Sneed, 431, 486. The Act of 1846, ch. 118, was passed to clear up the doubts

which are supposed to have existed in Foust v. Wilson, 3 Humph. 81, as to the
proper mode of procedure to enforce this lien. 2 Swan, 816. Unless the defend
snt is ii. non-resident or absconds, or otherwise brings himself within some of the
statutory grounds of original attachment, [Q 8455,] he must be personally sum
moned to make defense, if he havgény, to the plaintiﬂ‘s demand, otherwise the

proceeding will be void. Brown v. Brown, 2 Sneed, 481, 486. The appropriate
function of the attachment is to enforce the lim, and not the appearance of the
defendant. Ib. The attachment is auxiliary and collateral to the origt'nal pro
cess which compels the appearance of the defendant. Ib. The proper practice,
then, iii this proceeding, is thus indicated :"

§ 1. The defendant is summoned to answer the plaintiﬂ"s suit, whether the pro
ceeding be in law or equity. 2 Sneed, 437.
I
a. Or, ifit be a proper case for an original attachment, the usual attachment

will issue. Ib.
§ 2. If the plaintiff desire to secure and enforce his lien for the satisfaction of the
judgment to be rendered in the suit, he must cause an attachment to be levied on
the property as auxiliary to the original process in the suit. Ib.

§ 3. Or, this attachment may be incorporated with the original process, so that
it distinctly appear, and be levied on the property. Ib.
_

§ 4. Any court having jurisdiction of the matter in litigation, has power, to is
sue the attachment, as a Justice of the Peace, or the Circuit or Chancery Court,
conforming to its course of proceeding. Ib.; Q 3547.
§ 5. Being in aid merely of the ordinary suit, the attachment must follow it, and

be issued from the same court which has jurisdiction of the plaintiﬂ'.‘s demand,
conforming to the usual conditions as to the affidavit, bond, etc-., on which attach

ments are issued. Ib.

of that court issues the attachment, and has power to administer the oath for at

tachment. Ib.; 1 4050,‘ sub-sec. 1.

Any person to whom such debt is due, may make applica

Chancery Court, in the county in which the boat then is, for a
warrant to enforce and collect the same.

[Act 1833, ch. as, § 2.]

By whom and for what boat the debt was contracted.
The items composing the debt. (a)
That it is justly due, and unpaid.
And that demand has been made of some one of the de

fendants, or of the captain or agent of the defendants, being
at the time in the county. [Ib., §§ 2, 10.]
(a) But if the debt has been liquidated by note, the items comprising it need
not be set forth. Hill v. Mills, 9 Humph. 629,681 ; Greeulaw v. Potter, 5 Sneed,

§ 590, s94.
Fbr a form of the petition, which was held suﬂicient in the Supreme Court, see
Hill v. Hills, 9 Humph. 629, 630.

The policy of the statute embodied in this article is discussed in Hill v. Hills,
§ 9 Humph. 639, and Greenlaw v. Potter, 5 Sneed, 890. This statute was not in
tended to give a remedy against absconding or non-resident debtors. It was in
tended for a very different purpose, viz., to secure all persons who might do any
work or furnish any materials or articles toward the building, repairing, ﬁtting,
furnishing or equipping any steam or keel boat, or who might have wages due
them as hands on said boat, against loss therefrom ; and to give them a speedy
and eﬂ'ectual remedy to recover the same. This is done by giving a lieu on the
boat for the space of three months, and an attuchineut against it by which it is to

be held subject to the judgment of the court to which the proceedings are re
tumable, unless the debt be paid or security given therefor.

and hence it does not lie to compel a Justice to set aside satisfaction of an execu

acted as a judicial tribunal, and having found all the facts necessary to a judg
ment or decree, so that a judgment or decree would be nothing but a conclusion
of law on the facts, the entering up of the proper judgment must be regarded as

in its nature ministerial ; and in the absence of any other adequate speciﬁc rem.

§ 238. But the oﬂicer seeking induction must previously have done everything
necessary to make his title complete. Thus, where a person seeking induction
into ofﬁce tendered sureties who refused to justify, and the court thereupon
adjudged them insufficient, it was held that a mandamus would not lie to
compel the County Court to induct the applicant into the oﬂice. Ib.

may be necessary, in the same manner and subject to the same
rules as such writs issue from courts of record.
[Act 1831, ch. 111, § 2.]
The usual oﬂice of the scire facias is to revive suits on judgments in cnse of
the death or marriage of a party by or against his personal representatives, or in

a proper case against his heirs, or to give notice to sureties in case of forfeited
bail. Hence, the cases on this subject belong mostly to the chapter on Abatement
of Actions,§ 2846, et seq.; Administration, Q 2258, etseq.; the article on Re

vival of Judgmenls, Q 2987, at seq., and the article on Forfeilurc of Bailor De
posit in Criminal Cases, Q 5177, ct seq. No other cases in the Digests, or.in
the recent Reports, have been found which involve the construction of the provi
sions of this article, and hence nonc will be cited. It may be stated, however,

that the scire facioa is a judicial writ, and can only be awarded by the court,
except when the clerk is empowered by a statutory provision or a rule of court
to issue it. Hillman v. Hickcrson, 3 Head, 575, 577 ; Friersou v. Harris, 5

Chairman v. Sawyers, 1 'l‘h0mp.Cas. 65.

But where in a motion

against an otlicer and his “ securities," the name of one of the sureties was omit
ted by mistake, but judgment was rendered against the oﬂicer and all the sure

ties, this was held good. Jones, Gov. _v. Henderson, 1 Thomp. Gas. 53. But if
some oi‘ the sureties be dead, a motion will lie against the oﬂicer and survivors.‘
it Humph. 418; Houston v. Dougherty, 4 Humph. 505. That is, where a surety
is dead, and the administrator is not known, or there is none at the time of the j

motion. Gibson v. Martin, 7 Humph. 127. [But, query; for can the personal-‘
representative of a deceased surety be proceeded against by motion ? See Q 3597
and note.—Eds.]

The rule is that if one of the sureties be dead, the remedy is

complete against the surviving sureties.

Hearu v. Erwin, 3 Cold. 399, 401.

But

the record must disclose the death of the surety not embraced in the motion; and
if it fail to do so, and there is reason to believe that the oversight was not a cul
pable omission, the Supreme Court will remand to amend. Ib. In a later case,

where the judgment had been dcfectively entered, and where the defendant had
appeared without notice, the Supreme Court refused to remand. Stuart v. McCuis
tiou, 1 Heisk. 427, 430.—But if the oﬂicer be dead, a motion will not lie against
the sureties alone.

§ 3584. And whenever by"-this chapter a motion is given
against an oﬁicer, or other person acting under the orders of

court, it carries with it the right to move against him and the
sureties on his oiﬁcial bond, or other bond executed in the dis
charge of the particular duty, although such bond may not be
in strict compliance with the law.
C'onst_ruction ; statutory bond.—Statutes giving summary remedies in deroga

tion of the common ‘law are to be strictly construed and pursued. Sumner v.
Henry, 4 Yerg. 155 ; Mc(}rae v. Galey, 1 Tenn. 251 ; Smith v. Wells, 5 Yerg. 202;
Baker v. Agey, 2 Humph. 13; Rice v. Kirkman, 3 Humph. 415; Frost v. Rucker,

§ 606, 608 ; Stuart v. McCuistion, 1 Heisk. 427 ; Crockett v. Parkison, 3 Cold. 219.
Hence, before the Code, a. motion would not lie on a bond, unless the same had
been tuken in all particulars as required by the statute, and was therefore a good
statutory bond.

§ 1486

Where a statute giving the remedy by motion is silent on the subject of notice,
the reasonable inference is that no notice is required, and the court will not re
quire it. Coleman v. Davidson Academy, Cooke, 268; Newnnn' v. Campbell
Mart. & Yerg. 63, 65 ; Williams v. Harvey, Cooke, 466 ; Baxter v. Marsh. 1

Yerg. 460-1.
Srruice of not£ce.—The notice, in the cases where it is required, is not a judi~
cial process, but n mere individual act. Broughton v. Allen, 6 Humph. 96, 98;
Watkins v. Barnes, 1 Sneed, 201, 203. Being a mere private paper. it may be
served by a private individual. Cheatham v. Howell, 6 Yerg. 811. Or it may be

served by the sheriff, in which case his return is evidence of the service; but in
such a case it is not returned into court, but delivered to the party by whom it is
given. Ib. The notice therefore, is not a leading process, like the summons, by
which suit is commenced, nor does it belong to the court until the motion is made,
and it is produced inevidence. Ib. Hence, the cause is not in court until the mo
tion is made; and until the motion is made and entered of record, a motion to
nonsuit or dismiss cannot be entertained, nor can any other proceeding be had
in the cause. Ib. So it is held in other cases that it is the motion and not the

notice that creates the lie pendent. King v. Brceden, 2 Cold. 455, 459; Hill v.
Hinton, 2 Head, 124, 126. Hence nu oﬂicer may amend his return after the ser.
vice of notice, but before motion made. 1 Head, 126; 2 Cold. 459. See note to 6
§ 2863, p. 1207, ante. But when the motion is made the court has s. cause before
it which may be continued until ﬁnally heard. Ib. But the notice of a motion is

the commencement of a suit within the meaning of the statutes of limitation.
Young v. Hare, 11 Humph. 803. And see Givin v. Vanzant, 7 Yerg. 148. The
notice, where required, not being a judicial process, but the individual act of the

party giving it, it follows that the want of notice is cured by appearance and de
fense. 1 Sneed, 203. So, appearance and defense cure adefective notice. '11
Humph. 808. Or, an appearance in fact without exception to the notice is ii.
waiver of any defects in the notice. Chaﬂin v. Crutcher, 2 Sneed, 360. But where
the defendant appeared and the judgment against him was void for want of the
necessary recitals, his appearance in the court below and in the Supreme Court,
would not be a waiver of a new notice, or notice of such an amendment as would

/

be equivalent to a new suit. Stuart v. McCuistion, 1 Heisk. 427, 480.

Sui-eties are not entitled to notice. Where notice is required, if the principal
have notice, it is sufficient to warranta judgment against him and his sureties.
Baxter v. Marsh, 1 Yerg. 460; Young v. Hare, 11 Humph. 803. But it is said
that in such a case, if the judgment were founded upon a false state of facts,

however conclusive it would be as to the principal, the siireties would be en
titled to a writ of error ooram nobis to reverse it. 11 Humph. 805. See Q 3116
and note; Q 3117; 6 Humph. 336.

§ 3588. The plaintiff in any motion may be required to give Swirl»: for

security for the costs of suit as in other cases.
See also Q 3l89.—-A motion is an action within the meaning of the statutes
where the term “action” is used. Banks v. Brown, 4 Yerg. 198. It is a mere
action, without writ or declaration. Merritt v. Parks, 6 Humph. 882-3. Hence,
being in substance and legal effect a suit, in taxing the costs, the State tax must

be included.

#3590. The word court,in the foregoing section, embraces
Justices of the Peace, and a motion lies in all cases before the

Before the Code, Justices of the Peace had not power to render judgment upon
motion. McGregor v. l(cCorkle, 3 Humph. 578; Vanbibber v. Vanbibber, 10
Humph. 53. And it was held that the word “court ” in statutes giving this remedy

§ 3591. But the Circuit Court shall have concurrent jurisdic

Justices of the Peace are conﬁned to cases where the amount is within their
jurisdiction, but the Circuit Court is not limited as to amount. Thus, a motion
will lie in the Circuit Court where the amount moved for is less than ﬁﬁy dollars.

§ 3592. Whenever damages on a motion are given, in the

absence of any speciﬁc amount mentioned, the plaintiif will be
entitled to recover twelve and one half per cent on the whole _

amount, principal and interest, due at the time of the rendition
of the judgment. [Act 1835, ch 19, § 6.]
Dunnaway v. Collier, 2 Heisk. 10 ; Smith v. Van Bebber, 1 Swan, 110, 112.
Hence, where a motion has been made against a sheriﬂ‘ for the non-return of an
execution, [§ 3594, sub-sec. 1,] the tender after notice of the motion and before
judgment of the amount due on the execution, is no defense; for such a tender

Bebber, 1 Swan, 110; Q 3692.
As to defenses on motion for non-return, see Q 3601, and note.
II. False or insrqﬂicienl ratur-n.—To sustain a motion for a false or insuﬂicient
return, the falsitymust appear on the face ofthe return and extrinsic evidence is not
admissible. If it does not so appear, the remedy is by action. Hill v. Hinton, 2
Head, 124, 127; Fussell v. Greenﬁeld, 1 Sneed, 437, 443. If the return be not
insuﬂicient in point of law, that is, if it show an adequate reason why the money

was not made, a motion will not lie. If it be thought, notwithstanding his return,
that the sheriff has not used proper diligence, or that he has been guilty of negli
gence, the remedy is by action. Rains v. Childress, 2 Humph. 449. And in a
proceeding by motion against the sheriff for an insufficient return, it is not com
petent to look beyond the return to any extrinsic matter in aid of its defects.
Union Bank v. Barnes, 11 Humph. 244-5. If the sheriﬁ‘ fail to make a levy in
due timetosell, but makes due return, heis not liable to a motion for false return,

but may be guilty of negligence, for which he would be liable to an action.

T.i-igg

v. McDonald, 2 Humph. 886, 389. The return must answer the whole writ; but
it does not therefore follow that the return of nulla bona will be false, if it can
be shown that the defendant was possessed of goods during any part of the time
the sheriff had the writ in his hands. Such a doctrine would be absurd, for it

would require the sheriff to perform impossibilities.

Many writs of ﬁ. fa. come

into the hands of the sheriff in the same way, the parties to which live in distant
parts of the county. The sheriﬂ‘ must have some time to perform these various
duties ; and if any one of the defendants place his property beyond his reach before

he can make a levy he may return nulla. bona, which will not be a false return.
He must use reasonable diligence to execute the writ ; and in an action for a false
return, it would be for a jury to say, under all the circumstances, whetherhe had

been guilty of such negligence as to constitute the return of “no property found”
a. false return.

To make the retum of nulla bona. a false return, the shcriﬂmust

be informed that the defendant has goods in the county, and must have an oppor
tunity to makea levy. 2 Humph. 888. A levy upon land, if made at the request
ofthe execution defendant, cannot be questioned by the plaintiff; and in such a
case, the sheriff would not be bound to return “ no goods and chattels found,” in
order to protect himself against the plaintiﬂ’. 2 Humph. 889. And where the

sheriff levied on suﬂicient personalty to make part of the debt, and as to the bal
ance levied on realty, but too late to sell, and returned the facts, it was held ex
tremely questionable whether his return could be regarded in legal acceptation as
a false return, if it had been proved that the defendant in the execution had other
personal property which had not been levied upon, and of which fact the sheriff
had no cognizance. Ib. But in a later case it is held that where the return re
cites no personal property of one defendant to be found, and then a levy on real
estate, the return is prime facie insuﬂlcient-too clearly so toadmit of argument.

Hassell v. Southern Bank of Kentucky, 2 Head, 281.

See § 3026, and note.

If

the sheriff return that he has levied part only of the sum directed by theﬁ. fa. to

be levied, the plaintiff by receiving the money which the sheriff returns that he
has levied, waives his action against the sheriff for a false return. Ib. But it has
been decided in several cases that the issuance of an alias execution is not a
waiver of the right of motion against a defaulting oﬂicer, especially where such
execution issued at the instance of, and for the beneﬁt of the oﬂicer. Doyle v.
Glenn, 4 Hnmph 809; Barnes v. White, 2 Swan, 442; Dunnaway v. Collier, 2
Heisk. 10, 12. But if the plaintiff on such alias collects a part of the judgment,
the sheriff would be entitled to a credit for so much ; but the sheriff would still
be liable to the twelve and one half per cent damages given by the statute as a
penalty, notwithstanding the judgment against him after the sheriff's liability ac
crued. 2 Swan, 444. But in a later case it is held that where the oﬂicer‘s liability

had attached by reason of having made an inartiﬁcial return, but where the debt
was satisﬁed, the plaintiﬁ‘ could not recover damages; for there was nothing due
on the execution on which damages could be computed. Young v. Donaldson, 2
Heisk. 52, 56. This case discusses at length how far the plaintiff will be held to
have waived his remedy by a ratiﬁcation of the misfeasance of the oflicer, or by

taking beneﬁt under it.

Where the record shows that the debt is satisﬁed, until

the satisfaction is set aside by the proper proceeding, [§ 2990 ct seq.,] a motion

against the sheriﬂ‘ for an insuﬂicient return will not lie to recover either debt, in
terest or damages. Ib.
What is a suﬂicimt relurn.—'I'he return mustanswer the whole writ. Trigg v.
McDonald, 2 Hnmph. 886, 888. It must show that the sheriff has done what the
law requires of him, or state a good reason why he has not.

Head, 124, 127; Rains v. Ohildress, 2 Hnmph. 449.

Hill v. Hinton, 2

Either that the mandate of

the writ has been obeyed, or the existence of such legal cause, as without the
imputation of willful neglect or disregard of oilicial duty on the part of the sher
iﬁ, hindered his compliance. Eakin v. Boyd, 5 Sneed, 204 ; McCrory v. Chaﬁin,
§ 1 Swan, 807-8. This is necessary to make the return “ suﬂicient" within the
meaning of the statute. Union Bank v. Barnes, 10 Hnmph. 244. The return of
an execution is the statement by the sheriff, certiﬁed to the court under sanction
of his oath and oﬁlcial responsibility, of what he has done touching the execution
of the writ. This is the only method known to the law, by which the return of
the process or the proceedings thereon can be made known in court. The return

must be full and complete in itself, and embrace every matter required to be
stated.

If a delivery bond be taken and forfeited, these facts form a proper and

necessary part of the return ; and their existence can be known to the court only
from the certiﬁed return of the sheriﬂ' upon the writ, and a delivery bond re

turned by the sheriﬁ’ “forfeited,” but not referred to in the return, will not be
looked to to aid an insufﬁcient return. 10 Humph. 245.—A return, “came to
hand the day issued, and nothing made for lack of time,” is an insuﬁicient return,
although less than ten days elapsed between the day the writ issued and the re
turn day; for in such a case it is the duty of the sheriﬂ‘ to levy before and sell

after the return day.

McCrory v. Ghaﬂin, 1 Swan, 808; cited and approved in

§ 5 Sneed, 208. So, where the writ issued a month before the return day, and the
sheriﬂ‘ did not levy until within six days of the return day, and then returned the

writ “for want of time to advertise and sell" without stating any excuse for not
lovying on any of the property of either of the ﬁve defendants at an earlier day, the
return was held insuﬂicient. Eakin v. Boyd, 5 Sneed, 204. But where the sher
iff levied on personal property twenty days before the return day, and took a de
livery bond therefor, which was forfeited by non-delivery of the property on the

day of sale, he was not liable to motion for an insufficient return on the ground
that he might have levied sooner; for he was not bound to anticipate the forfeit

ure of the delivery bond, and hence his return showed a sufficient legal reason
for failing to make the money. Ilainsv. Childress, 2Humph. 449; cited and dis
tinguished in 5 Sneed, 207. “Stopped by order of plaintiff" is a good return.

State v. McDonald, 9 Humph. 606. “No goods found in my county, ” though in
formal is substantially a good return. Peeble’s case, Peck, 196. And see Gon
way v. Jett, 8 Yerg. 48l.—Tl1e sheriff cannot return that he has retained the money for damages which he supposes himself entitled torecover from the plain
tiﬂ‘ in the execution of an indemnifylug bond taken in another case.
Blake, 2 Humph. 674.

Hinkle v.

III. Failure to pay over money wlledod.--'l'he statutes giving the remedy by
motion for failing to pay over money collected are not in derogation of the common

law, being a substitute for the attachment at common law against the otlicer.
They are hence to be construed remedially, and in this respect forman exception
to statutes giving summary remedies which in general are to be strictlyconstrued.
Cook v. Smith, 1 Yerg. 148; Cannon v. Wood, 2 Sneed, 177, 184; note to} 8584.
If the sheriff pay over the money collected to the plaintitf in the execution, or to
another party by the plaintiffs direction, he will be protected by such payment as
against the demands of third parties who may be beneﬁcially interested in the pm
ceeds. Atkinson v. Cooper, 2 Humph. 861. But where a partner made an un

authorized transfer of a judgment against the ﬁrm, and a deputy sheriﬁ‘ collected
the money and paid it to the assignee, he was held liable on motion. Vance v.
Campbell, 8 Humph. 524, 527. And where judgment is rendered in favor of one

person for the use of another, although as decided in Jennings v. Pray, 8 Yerg.
§ 85, 88, the execution must conform to the judgment and be issued in favor of the
nominal plaiutiﬁ‘ for the use of the beneﬁciary, yet the beneﬁciary is the real

plaintiff in the execution, and the sheritl‘ would be bound to pay the money to
him; for the execution itself notiﬁes him to whom the money belongs, the name
ot' the nominal plaintiﬁ being a mere shadow, used to preserve form. Barnes v.
Hays, 1 Swan, 304, 806; 1 Yerg. 175; Q 2795, and note. So, where costs are
collected, although they are nominally recovered in favor of the plaintiﬂ‘ in the
execution, yet he has no beneﬁcial interest in them, and cannot recover them by
motion against the sheriff. It is the duty of the sheriff to pay them to the clerk

[reserving his own,] who distributes them to the persons entitled to receive them,
namely, the oﬂicers of the court and witnesses. See Smith v. Van Bebber, 1 Swan,
§ 110; Carey v. Campbell, 8 Sneed, 62 ; Q 8218, and note.—Where there is a dis
pute as to whom moneys collected on execution rightfully belong, the sheriff may

protect himself by paying them into court, and the court will direct their applica
tion in a summary manner. 2 Humph. 366.—The sheriﬁ‘ ought, if applied to before
he has returned the moneys, to pay them to the person entitled to receive them ;
but if not applied to, should return them into the oﬂice, together with the writ of
execution; otherwise he is liable to motion. Cock v. Cummings, 4 Hayw. 191 ;
Nelson v.WiHiams, 4 Hayw. 161 ; Q 3l596.—See also, Vance v. Cheatham, 6 Hayw.
§ 39 ; Cheatham v. Jones, Ib., 37.
Deputy.—It was held in one case, that a deputy sheriff is notliablo for acts done
in his otliclal capacity, except to his principal. Rose v. Lune, 3 Humph. 218. But
in Witcher v. Oldham, 4 Sneed, 220, there was a recovery by motion against the
deputy for otlicial delinquency, when the motion had previously been made against
the principal sheriﬂ‘, but had failed, though not on the merits. And it would
seem from this case and Christain v. Hoover, 6 Yerg. 505, that both the principal
sheriﬂ‘ and deputy are liable for the official default of the deputy, and that a judg
ment on the merits in favor of the one, or a judgment with satisfaction, against
thc one, would be a bar to a motion or action against the other. But the Act
of 1829, ch. 41, Q 2, Car. &. Nich., p. 670, expressly gave the remedy by motion
against a deputy sherill‘ or deputy clerk for money collected and not paid over;
but this section docs not seem to be carried into the Code, but is swept away by
the general repealing clause, Q 41. But section one of that act, giving the otlicer
n remedy against his deputy, is preserved inﬂ 8605, sub-sec. 2, and in Q 3607;
and a separate remedy by motion is preserved against deputy clerks by Q 3611.

Sec Vance v. Campbell, 8 Humph. 624, 526, where this section is noticed, and
Rose v. Lane above quoted is criticized. And see 4 King’s Digest, Q 11,219, and
note. And a motion lies against the sheriff for a failure of his deputy to pay over
money collected, or the default of his deputy in not making due retum of an
execution placed in the hands of the deputy by a Justice of the Peace. Snell v.
Rawlings, 3 Humph. 85.

What the judgment muataIww.—The judgment need not recite the evidence ; for
if it state the facts simply, it will be presumed that there was auiﬁcient testimony
to authorize the court to assume their existence. Burt v. Davidson, 5 Humph.

§ 525 ; Ferrell v. Finch, 8 Yerg. 432. All the facts giving the court jurisdiction,
[note to Q 8584,] must be stated; as-—

that the defendant was sheriff, the suretyship of the other defendants, the relation
of principal and deputy, and the collection by the deputy of speciﬁed sums of
money, that executions went into the hands of the deputy, and that they were not

returned, contains a suﬂicient statement of fact. Snell v. Rawlings, 8 Humph. 85.
§ 5. In a motion against a constable and his surcties the judgment must show the
suretyship of the defendants other than the constable, or it will he void as to them.

Revlvor.

§ 3597. In case of the death of an oﬂicer or either of his
sureties, pending a motion against them, it may be revived
against the personal representative of the deceased in the same
manner as other suits are revived. [Act 1857-8, ch. 39.]
Before this Act such motions could not he revived either against the represen
tutive of a deceased oﬂicer or the representative of his surety. Burroughs v.
Goodall, 2 Head, 29, 81. Nor could a motion originally be made against the per
sonal rcpresentative of an oﬁicer. State v. Deberry, 9 Humph. 605. Nor against
the personal representative of an oﬂicer‘s surety. Park v. Walker, 2 Sneed, 502,

§ 509.

[It would seem from the language of Q 2583, that the revisers of the Code

meant to continue this rule.—-Eds.]

But by § 8626, an exception is mnde in case

of motions in favor of sureties, etc.

But if one or more of th_e sureties be dead, a

motion will lie againstthe principal and survivors. Dictum in Rice v. Kirkman,3
Humph. 416, 418; following Houston v. Dougherty, 4 Humph. 505. See Q 8688,
and note. The abatement of a motion against an oﬁicer abates it also as to his
sureties. 2 Head, 30. See Q 2846.
Erldence

§ 3598. On the trial of the motion, a copy of the execution
made and certiﬁed by the clerk, with the return thereon, if any
was made, or a statement that no return was made, if such be

the fact, -together with his certiﬁcate that the execution was re
ceived by the sheriif, or sent to him by mail, is evidence of the
facts so certiﬁed, without producing a transcript of the entire
record, or compelling the clerk himself to attend.
[Ala. Code 1852, § 2614.]
Certiﬁcate

§ 3599. So, also, the certiﬁcate as aforesaid that the execu

tion was sent to the oﬂicer by mail, will be prima facie evidence
that the writ was received by the oﬂicer, unless he states, un

der oath in writing, that he never received the writ. In such
case, the officer shall have notice of the motion.
E'vidence.—-A motion may be maintained againsta sheriff without producing his
bond, and, consequently, whether it has been recorded or not; and against his
sureties, if it has been recorded before the hearing of the motion. Williamson v.
Webb, 8 Humph. 133. The non-return must be aﬁrmatively proven. The mere
absence of a return on the docket is not suﬂicient. Gibson v. Martin, 7 Humph.

§ 127. A motion against an oﬂicer for failing to retum cannot be supported by
showlng a false or insuﬂiciem‘. return. Watkins v. Barns, 1 Swan, 201.

judgment will be for the amount so received, with interest and
damages.
ch. 87.]

But where the money was never in fact collected by the oﬂicer, but instead
thereof he wrongfully converted and disposed of the note in payment of his own
debt, there is no statute giving the remedy by motion. Haynes v. Bridge, l Cold.
§ 82, 84. The sheriﬂ’ is a ministerial oﬁicer whose duties and responsibilities are

prescribed by law; and where money is required to be received upon process or
claims put in his hands, he can receive nothing else; and if he do so—that is, if
he take debts due by himself, choses in action or property, it is not a satisfaction
of the debt, and the debtor may be made to pay it again, and the sheriif having
acted out of his line of duty, his sureties are not responsible for the act. The
actual receipt of the money by the sheriﬁ‘ is a condition of the debtor's discharge.
The cases go upon the ground of public policy, which will not suffer an oﬁcer to
travel out of his duty. 1 Cold. 84; citing many authorities. Ifthe oﬁicer had
actually collected the money of the debtor upon the claim, though without pro

cess, then by force of the legislation of our State, he and his sureties would be
liable; but where a deputy sheriﬂ‘ instead of collecting s note, turned it over to
his own creditor in payment of his own debt, this conduct, though grossly wrong
ful was unoﬂic-ial, and could not be binding upon the principal sheriﬁ' or his

surety, or on the creditors. 1 Cold. 35.

See also, State v. Gilmore, 8 Sneed, 608,

where the Act of 1827, ch. 85, § 4, received construction. The remedy extends
to all collections made by the sherilf in his ojieial character, upon process or
otherwise. 3 Sneed, 505. But where a deputy sheriff executes a receipt for
notes to be by him collected, he is liable in his individual capacity. Rose v. Lane,
§ 3 Humph. 218. So a constable by receiving s note for collection becomes the

agent of the plaintiff ; and for any negligence in failing to sue on the note, or to
take out execution, or any other unojicial act, ho would be personally answer
able in an action; but for these things his sureties are not responsible, the same
not constituting oﬂicial misconduct, but merely the violation of the duty of a pri
vate agency, which it has been held he is not forbidden by his oﬂicial station to
assume. Crittenden v. Terrill, 2 Head, 588. But the oiﬁcial duty of constables

has been so enlarged by statute as to render them and their surotics responsible
for failure to pay over money collected by them in their olﬁcial character as con

stables by virtue of their oﬁce, but without process in their hands.

§ 2 Head,

§ 591 ; Bosley v. Smith, 8 Humph. 406, 410. The liability of the sureties in such
it case arises under the general clause in the constable’s bond, “ln all things be

longing to his oﬂice, well and truly to demean himself during his continuance
therein.” 3 Humph. 410. See Q 385; note to Q 392.
If an oﬂicer collect moneys after the expiration of his term of qﬂlce, [unless he
had levied before,] his sureties are not bound for the same. Atkins v. Bailey, 9
Yerg. 111. And where a claim was placed in the hands of a constable whose
time expired before the collection of the money, and the money was collected by

another constable on an execution, and paid over to the ex-constable, this was a valid payment by the acting constable to the ex-constable as agent of tne creditor,
and the sureties of the ex-constable are not liable. 2 Head, 588. And so, if a
sheriff receive notes for collection, and prosecute them to judgment, and place
the execution in the hands of a constable, the constable would be protected by a
payment of the money to the sheriﬂ‘ as the plaintiffs agent; but if the constable
received the execution from the plaintiﬂ‘, he would not be protected by a pay

ment to the sheriﬂ‘, but would be liable to the plaintiff.

Defence by

deposit in
the mall.
§ 360]. It shall be a good defence to a motion against an of
ﬁcer residing in any county other than that from which an ex
ecution issued, for the oﬁicer to show by proof that he, in dne

time, placed the process in the regular mail, at the court-house
of the county to which the execution was directed, with the
proper return thereon, sealed up in the presence of the post
master, directed to the clerk of the court from which the same,
issued. [Act 1835, ch. 19, § 6.]
Olher dcf¢naea.—Matters equitable as well as legal may be givcn in defense.
Wells v. Gant, 4 Yerg. 491. Thus, where a constable had collected money on exc
eution, and on tendering it to the plaintiff, was told that he might keep it several
weeks, and he did so, and during the time became insolvent, it was hold that the

surety might show this, and that it would entitle himto be discharged. Ib.

And

see Billingsby v. Rankin, 2 Swan, 82.

A. It is a good defense to a motion for the non-return of an execution
§ 1. That the failure to return was occasioned by the instructions or intermed
dling of the plaintiif. Robinson v. Harrison, 7 Humph. 189; cited approvingly in
Koger v. Donnell, 1 Head, 877-8.
a. And so it seems, an order from the plaintiﬁ to “hold up” the execution,
would be a good defense ; but it is held that where personal property has been

levied on, an order to hold up tltaaala will not excuse a non-return.

turn Justlce’s
Justice’s execution, on account of sickness, high water, or en- °‘°°“"’°“'
gagement in executing any precept in behalf of the State, will
be a suﬂicient reason to authorize a Justice of the Peace, be

fore whom the motion has been made, to discharge the oﬂicer
for his failure to make return as required.
§ 3603. Any sheriﬁ' or other ofﬁcer failing to execute and }f,‘,*{}§,‘,§Y,,,‘°'

make return of any process issued from any court of record, Féiihiﬁidders
and delivered to him twenty days before the return day, is lia
ble to a penalty of one hundred and twenty-ﬁve dollars, to be
recovered by the party aggrieved on motion before the court to
which the process is returnable. [Act 1777 ch. 8, § 5, modiﬁed.]
The word " return,” in this section, is construed to mean that the oﬂlcer must
not only hand in the writ at the proper term, but must show by his endorse
ment on it that he has done what the law required of him, or a good reason why
he has not. Hence a motion will lie under this section for a false or insuﬂicient

return.

But the inquiry is conﬁned tolhe face of the return and extrinsic evidence

is excluded. The inquiry is whether or not the retum is good in law. Hill v.
Hinton, 2'Hesd, 124, 127. A return that the defendant is “not found in my

county,” instead of “ not to be found in my county,” though informal is not suﬂl
ciently defective to sustain a motion for a penalty. Ib., citing Peeble‘s case, Peck,
§ 196, which holds that a return upon a _/ieri facias of “no goods found in my
county," though informal, is substantially good.

What the judgment must show.—See note to Q 8584; note to I 3594.—The
judgment will be void unless it show on its face that the process went into the
hands of the oﬂicer more than twenty days before the return day.

Wilkinson, Brownsville, 1868; cited in King Dig.,§ 11,208.

Bartlett v.

On such a judgment against the principal no valid judgment can be rendered against the sureties

thereupon may be quashed on motion, petition or certiorari. Ib.

(c)

[Act 1824, ch. 16, § 2.]

(a) An indannifying bond, signed alone by a stranger to the execution, is a
valid statutory bond, and may be proceeded on by motion. Jobe v. Bellars, 9
Humph. 178. See Q 773.
(6) Against deputy/.—'1‘he original Act of 1829, was held to provide for two
cases: 1. Where the sheriﬂ‘had paid money. 2. Where he had become liable to
pay money. That is, before the principal sheriﬂ‘ could have a remedy against his
deputy, either his liability must have been ascertained by judgment, or he must
have actually paid money without judgment, which he was liable to pay on ac
count of the default of the deputy. Jarnigan v. Atkinson, 4 Humph. 470. This

ruling was warranted by the language of the original act, namely:

§ 1498

“In all cases where any sheriff shall have paid money or become liable to pay money, ” etc.
But it will be seen that sub-section two, above, restricts the remedy to cases
where the liability of the principal sheritf has been ascertained by judgment;

and this is in accordance with the construction given the original act ln Patter.
son v. Coleman, 4 Humph. 64—a construction afterwards modiﬁed by Jarnigan v.
Atkinson, as above stated.--It follows that where the plaintiff in the execution

notiﬁed the sheriﬂ‘ that he would move against him for the default of his deputy
at a certain term, and the sheriff thereupon notiﬁed the deputy that be would
move against him at the same term, the notice to the deputy was prematurely

given.

But in such a case, the appearance of the deputy would waive the irreg

ularity, if judgment should be taken against the principal sheriffﬁrst.

§ 4 Humph.

§ 65. The deputy may avail himself of the same equitable defenses that are al
lowed in an action on the case. Thus, he may show that the insuﬂiciency of the
return was caused by the fault or negligence of the principal, as where the prin
cipal sheritf actually wrote the return in question, and the deputy, conﬁd-ing in
his superior judgment, signed it. Cate v. Howard, 1 Swan, 15. As to the liabil
ity of the sheriﬂ for the acts 0!‘ his deputy, see note HI, to Q 8594 ; Rose v. Lane,

(c) Such a motion lies against the clerk on behalf of the parties interested,
although he may have paid over the costs to the plaintiﬂ‘ in the execution, and in
whose name they are recovered. Carey v. Campbell, 3 Sneed, 62. And see
Q 3218, and note. Under the original act, the remedy by motion did not extend
to the sureties of the clerk. Combs v. Bramlett, 4 Yerg. 569 ; Smiley v. Bigley,
§ 5 Sneed, 280.—But this is now changed by Q 3684. Under the language of the
original act, the motion was held to lie in the court of which theperson in default

was clerk, and it hence embraced spacial 0-iminal court-I, us well as others.

[Act 18-21, ch. s3,§ 1, 1s27, 011.49, §25.
“ Theparty aggr-icved."—By the Act of 1827, ch. 49, Q 25, “ the holder of any
legal claim ” was entitled to this remedy against thecounty trustee.

Under this

act it was held that although claims against the county audited and allowed by
the County Court had no negotiable quality, yet as they were generally for small
amounts, and many of them often accumulated in the hands of the same person,
it would be inconvenient and oppressive to require a separate motion in each case
in the name of the legal owner for the use of the holder; but that any person who
may be the holder and owner of any legal claim may maintain the motion in his
own name, and that possession is prima fade evidence that he is owner. The
county trustee is required where claims are presented to him for payment, to en

ter them in a book showing the order of presentation. Act 1827, ch. 49,§ 19 ; Q
§ 427, sub-sec. 3. And to pay such claims in their numerical order. Same act; Q
§ 427, sub-sec. 18. If he pays claims of a later date, and leaves prior claims unpaid,
he is liable to the prior claimants on motion. 11 Hnmph. 684-5. If in the notice

of the motion the claims are specially recited, this will cure the informality of not
specifying them with sutﬁcient certainty in the motion itself. 11 Humph.
§ 535. In a motion in the name of the chairman of the County Court for revenue
not paid over by the trustee, it was held that the motion would not lie against the

sureties alone, although the trustee was dead.

§ 7 Humph. 116, 120.

What the judgment must show.—'1‘he remedy furnished by this statute is with
out notice, summary, and contrary to the course of the common law; and hence
the proceeding on its face must show that the case comes within the statutory re
quirements, or the court will be without jurisdiction. McNairy v. Enstlrmd, 10
Yerg. 810, 814. It is asummary, a parte proceeding, in which the defendant
has no day in court to make his defense, and hence the plaintitf must make out
his case in every particular, and the judgment must show that he has done so, and

if material facts are omitted from the judgment, they will be presumed not to have
been proven, and the judgment will be void. Gannon v. Wood, 2 Sneed 177, 184.
The case must be brought strictly within the statute. Voorhies v. Dickson, 1
Sneed, 348; Cannon v. Wood, 2 Sneed, 177, 182. And the judgment must recite
and assume all the facts which give the court jurisdiction. Jones v. Read, 1
Humph. 335, 842; 2 Sneed, 182; note to § 8584.
Thejudgment must show—
§ 1. In what forum it is rendered, so that it may be seen that the court ren
dering it was of competent jurisdiction. 2 Sneed, 182.
§ 2. That a judgment had previously been obtained by the creditor against the

surety.

Jones v. Read, 1 Humph. 336, 848.

§ 3. The nature of the suretyship ; as, under the Act of 1801, that the judgment
against the surety was rendered on a “ note, bill, bond or obligation,” inwhich he
was liable only as surety. 2 Sneed, 182.

a. This is the more necessary where the proceeding is before s Justice of the
Peace; for in such case, unless the suretyship appears on the face of the proceed
ings in which the judgment against the surety was had, a jury will he necessary,

and hence the justice will not have jurisdiction. Q 2623, and note.
b. So, in a motion under Q 3630, the judgment must show that the surety is an
accommodation endorser. Allen v. Wood, 1 Head, 386.
§ 4. Where the motion was by one of several joint sureties, the judgment must
recite that it appeared to the court what amount the surety had actually paid; for

except so far as he himself had satisﬁed the judgment against himself and co-sure
ties, he could not have aseparate judgment against his principal. l Humph. 343;
§ 10 Yerg. 314. Now see next section and note.

§ 3621. And such motion may be joint or several at the op—
tion of the sureties.
Under the Acts of 1801, ch. 15, and 1809, ch. 59, it was held that where there
were several principal ohligors, judgment by motion in favor of their sureties
could not be revived against part only, except the others were dead, in which case

judgment might be rendered against the survivors. Hall v. Thompkins, 9 Humph.
§ 592; Voorhies v. Dickson, 1 Sneed, 348. But judgment against part of the sure
ties, the others not being dead, though voidable was not void, and was a pro
tection to purchasers thereunder. Ib. [Query/, whether this rule is changed by
the Code, Q 2789, making all joint obligations joint and several ?—Eds.] See note
to Q 3583. The above section changes the rule of Jones v. Read, 1 Humph. 385,
§ 343, and McNairy v. Eastland, 10 Yerg. 810, 314, which held that where judg

ment had been rendered against sureties they were entitled to judgment against
their principal, but the judgment could only be jointly in favor of all the sureties
and for the whole amount of the recovery against them. But one of several joint
sureties could have a judgment over against the principal for so much of the

judgment against the sureties as he had paid. 1 Humph. 843. And so in New
nan v. Campbell, Mart. &Yerg. 63, 66, it was held that where the sureties had
paid the judgment, a joint judgment in their favor against their principal would
be erroneous; but where a judgment had been rendered against the sursties
jointly, they would be entitled to a joint judgment over against their principal.
Recovery.

§ 3622. The judgment will be for the amount of the re
covery, or payment, as the case may be, with interest and costs.
But a surety cannot recklessly, and without authority from his principal, in a

case where it is clear that defense is hopeless, litigate an action, and thereby en
title himself to reimbursement of the costs from his principal. Holt v. Winstead,
§ 5Cold. 568, 570; citing Pars. Con., 438; 1 Pars. Notes and Bills,243. Butfor

the costs of his real bonaﬁde defense, he is entitled to indemnity, and may enforce it against his principal. 5 Cold, 6'10; Overton v. Hardin, 6 Cold. 875, 381. An
cndorser for value however, has no remedy against the maker for costs incurred
by him in his own defense. 6 (lold. 881.

§ 3623. If the fact of suretyship does not appear upon the :=';lvpt_<>r»nre:r
face of the proceedings on which judgment has been had or
payment made, or of the instrument on which the motion un
der this article is founded, a jury shall be immediately empan
neled to try the fact. [Act 1809, ch. 69, § 2.]
This section is substantially repealed in § 3628\—It follows that unless the
suretyship appear on the face of the instrument, a Justice of the Peace has no
jurisdiction; for a Justice cannot empannel a jury. Cannon v. Wood, 2 Sneed,
§ 177, 182-3. So, it was hold on general grounds that the Act of I809, ch. 69, by

which this remedy in favor of sureties was ﬁrst given, did not contemplate that
this juiisdiction should be exercised by Justice of the Peace; and this opinion

was strengthened by the frequent use of the word “ court ” in the original act,
which was held not to include Justice. But now this ruling and deﬁnition of the
word “ court ” are changed by I 8590, which see.

§ 3624. N0 surety will be permitted to confess judgment, ;_.,d,,,,,,,,,.

or allow judgment to go by default, if the principal will make "om ‘m“°W'
himselfa defendant to the suit, and tender to the surety for

his indemnity suiiicient collateral security, to be approved by
the court or justice before whom the suit is pending.

[Act 1801, ch.15, §a.]
A judgment, by confession or otherwise, will entitle the sureties jointly to this
remedy against their principal. Newnan v. Campbell, Mart. 8: Yerg. 68. And it

is not 1'1 prerequisite to the sureties’ right to this remedy that the principal should
have been notiﬁed of the existence of the suit against the sureties, and should have
had the opportunity to give the indemnity provided for by the above statute. Ib.
If the offer by the principal to defend and give counter security be not made, the
surety is not obliged to defend since the above act any more the-n before. And
indeed, he stands exactly as before, if such olfer be not made. Before the act
he might pay without su-it, and confess judgment for much more than was legally

due, but he could recover only for so much as was legally due.

and to his attorney, if out ofthe State, of his intention to move
for a rule upon him, to give counter security to indemnify him
against his liability as such surety. [Act 1822, ch, 42, § 1.]
§ 3666. Upon notice thus given, the court or Justice shall $11:gm?
makea rule requiring the pla.iutiﬁ', within a given time, to
give such counter security; and on failure of the plaintiff to
comply with the rule, the court will dismiss the suit, and give
judgment against the plaiutiﬂ' and his surety for the costs
already accrued.

[Ib.]

The above two sections are inartiﬁcially drawn ; but construing them so as to
give eifect to the intention of the Legislature, their meaning is held to be, that the

remedy given applies in favor of sureties in all cases, without regard to the atti
tude oi‘ the parties as plaintiifahd defendant. The omission oi‘ the word defend
ant, in Q 8666, must therefore be supplied, and the word plaintzf must be taken to
mean the actor or principal for whom the applicant surety is bond. Kincaid v.
Sharp, 8 Head, 151, 154. It follows that the sureties of apetitioner forcertimwi,
although such petitioner be defendant in the suit, are embraced in the above pro
visions. Ib.
“ Co-its already accrued."—By the letter of the above section there is n(»author
ity given to subject the discharged surety to any liability, except for costs already
accrued. This is another singular omission, but one which may be supplied by
construing H 3131 and 3137 in connection with the above section. It must be
taken to have been the intention of the Legislature that in either event, the court
should render such judgment as, under the circumstances, might be appropriate,
and in accordance with the established rights of the parties. The statute, then, is
held not to discharge the surety from any legal liability with which he had become

ﬁxed previous to his discharge, but merely to relieve him from future liability.
Kincaid v. Sharp, 8 Head, 151, 154-5. It follows that where s surety in a earlier
ari bond had procured his discharge under the provisions of the last two sections,
and afterwards trial was had on the merits and judgment rendered against the de

fendant, it was properto render judgment against the discharged surety for the
amount of the jiulgment below, the statutory damages, and so much of the coats
as had accrued previously to the surety/‘s discharge. Ib.

§ 3669. If the principal fail to give such counter security
within ﬁve days after the service of notice, the Justice or

clerk of the court, as the case may be, is authorized, upon aili

him to seize and hold such property, according to the terms of

the original seizure or attachment, subject to the defendant’s
‘right to again replevy; and in case he fails so to do, then sub

Under the Act of 1818, ch. 119, Q 5, the court could not release the sureties of

lunatics and other persons of unsound mind. is intrusted to the
County and Chancery Courts.
[Act 1797, ch. 41; 1851-2, ch. 163.]
Jurttdt'ct|'.<m.-—It was held in Oakley v. Long, 10 Humph. 254, that the court of
chaucery in this State has no inherent jurisdiction of idiots, lunatics, and persons
of unsound mind. Such jurisdiction resided exclusively in the County Court, un
til it was conferred upon the Chancery Court by the Act of 1851-2, ch. 163.
Appeal.-—It will be observed that an appeal is no where expressly provided for
in this chapter. In Cooper v. Summers, 1 Sneed, 458, it was held1. That under the Act of 1843-4, ch. 99, an appeal lies from the decision of the
County Court to the Circuit Court.
§ 2. That the receiving of the inquisition by the County Court and ordering it to
ho entered of record is such a “decision " as may be appealed from under that
Act.
§ 8. That upon such appeal, the Circuit Court will have no jurisdiction either to
mnpauncl a jury, or to award an inquisition dc novo ; but that such an appeal can
only operate as an appeal in error, and that the Circuit Court can only revise the
proceedings of the County Court, and alﬁrm or reverse and set aside the same, as
may be proper.

[It is said in this case, that the question whether an appeal would lie was inci
deutally considered and decided in the aﬂirmutive in Thomasson v. Kercheval,
ll) Humph. 322; but that case will hardly bear such a construction. It is true
that the cause referred to in that case went to the Circuit Court by appeal, prob
ably appeal in error, and thence to the Supreme Court by appeal in error, and
there the appeal in error abated by the death of the supposed lunatic ; and
the question considered was whether the appeal had the effect to vacate the origi

naljudgment, or merely to suspend it, and it was held that it merely had the ef
fect to suspend it, and hence on the abatement of the appeal in error the judg
ment of the County Court remained in full force, and that the record of such judg
ment was admissible in evidence to avoid a contract made by the lunatic, on the

ground of her lunacy. The Act of 1848-4, ch. 99, upon which the ruling in
Cooper v. Summers is based, provided that “ where any person or persons may
conceive him, her, or themselves, or the county aggrieved by any decree or de

cision of any County Court in this State, or by such Counly Court making allow
ances out of the public or courtly moneys, it shall and may be lawful for such per
son or persons to ask for and obtain an appeal from the decision or judgment of

said County Court,” etc. This Act does not seem to be in terms carried into

(‘-ircuit Court from the decision of the County Court in a proceeding under this
Article, the cause would, by the provisions of § 8152, be tried in the Circuit

Court do nova.-Eds.] If no appeal or writ of error in this proceeding were
given by statute, a cerliorrari would lie, this being the almost universal method
l»_v which the Circuit Court, as a court of general jurisdiction, exercises control

over inferior jurisdictions, however constituted, and whatever their course of pro
eroding.

Cooper v. Summers, 1 Sneed, 458, 456; Q! 8123, 3124, 3126, and notes.

“ Other persons of unsound mind."—Under the Aot oi‘ 1797, the jurisdiction
of the County Court was limited to “idiots and lunatics ” merely, and it did not
extend to persons disabled by sickness or age from taking care of themselves.

Cooper v. Summers, 1 Sneed, 458, 45'] ; Oakley v. Long, 10 Humph. 254, 263.
But this jurisdiction of idiots, lunatics, “ and other persons of unsound mind” was
wisely given to the Chancery Court by the Act of 1851-2, oh. 168. 1 Sneed, 457.

And the above section of the Code, and Q 8683, expressly extend it to the Coun
ty Court. Nevertheless, it seems that any return short of the ﬁnding that the per
son is of unsound vniud will not support the inquisition. 10 Humph. 262.

§ 166. The State courts may decide upon the legality of the imprisonment, and dis
charge t‘he prisoner, even though the determination may involve questions of jur

isdiction of the United States Courts, or the constitutionality of acts of Congress.
Ib.; Reynolds’ case, 6 Parker’s Cr. R. 276, 287. If the laws of the United States
justify the detention of the applicant, there is nothing illegal. If they do not, it
is not a can arising under the laws of the United States, although it may be un
der color or pretense of authority by virtue of those laws.

But a pretense of au

thority under the laws of the United States is no better than any other pretense.
§ 12 N. H. R. 197; Ohio v. Fitch, 20. Ind. 498, 508. Practically the doctrine of
giving exclusive jurisdiction to the U. S. Courts of habeas corpus proceedings
where the detention is sought to be justiﬁed under the laws of the United States,

would favor arbitrary power against the rights and liberty of the citizen and the
centralization of power in theFedera1 Government at the expense of the Sovereignty
of the State. Ib. The State Courts may in all cases require the officer to exhibit
his authority, and the State Court may judge whetherit is legal or not on its face.
Ohio v. Fitch, 20 Ind. 489, 507. In the Reynolds case, 6 Parker’s Cr. R. 2'76,
§ 287, there are a large number of respectable authorities cited in favor of the juris

diction of the State Courts.

N0tc.—If the courts of this State have power to grant

the writ of habeas corpus in the cases excepted in this section, in the absence of
the rule of law laid down in the section, then the constitutionality of the section

is worthy of grave consideration. See § 15, Art. 1, Coast. of Tenn.
§ 3722. Application for the writ shall be made by petition,
signed either by the party for whose beneﬁt it is intended, or
some person on his behalf, and veriﬁed by afﬁdavit.
[Ib., § 3710.]
The court may in certain cases without petition award the writ. See Q 3780.
Where a prisoner is committed by a magistrate, and applies for a writ of habeas
corpus on the ground that the evidence was not suﬂicient; or if he be committed
without bail for a non-bailable offence, and claims that he is entitled to bail
under the evidence, the testimony heard by the magistrate must be set forth in the

petition.

The aﬂidavit of the prisoner's counsel that in his judgment the evidence

was insufficient, will not answer, as the court is bound to presume that the magis

trate acted properly. Exports Klepper, 26 Ills. 582. Seenote to Q 3725.

The object o L18 writ of habeas corpus was not to enable persons to assert a

the court or Judge by whom it is issued or allowed. If served
by any other person than the sheriff, he possesses the same
power, and is liable to the same penalty for nonperformance of

his duty, as though he were the sheriff.

§ 3734. If the defendant refuse admittance to the person at

plaintiff shall be discharged. [Ib., 2247.]
A discharge on a habeas corpus proceeding does not preclude an investigation
by a Grand Jury. Walker v. Martin, 43 Ills. 508. The adjudication of an oﬂicer
having power to issue and decide upon a writ of habeas corpus, may be set up as

facts. In re De Costa, 1 Parker's Cr. R. 129.

Commitment.

§ 3752. Although the commitment of the person detained
may have been irregular, still, if the court or Judge is satisﬁed,

from the examination, that he ought to be held to bail, or com
mitted, either for the oﬂ'ence charged, or any other, the order
should be made accordingly.

[lb.,§ 2248.]

The court or judge may call witnesses before him when the commitment is de
fective, and inquire into the guilt of the prisoner, and remand, recognize, or dis
charge him. State v. Best, 7 Blackf. 611.
§ 3753. The plaintiff, in writing or his attorney, may waive mnnmr may

his right to be present at the examination, in which case the iiiiiiei-‘life
proceedings may be had in liis absence.
§ 3754. Disobedience of the original writ, or’ any subsequent Penalty for au
order thereon, subjects the defendant to commitment for con- svbrlil-1em of '

tempt, and also to a forfeiture of one thousand dollars to the
party aggrieved, besides rendering him liable for all damages

sustained in consequence of such disobedience.

§ 3755. The attempt to elude the service of the writ of ha- p,ru=;~|r‘_fe.:5;>‘3‘L<;_

beas corpus, or to avoid the eﬁ'ect thereof by transferring the
the plaintiff to another, or by concealing him, is a high mis

demeanor, for which the guilty person, and any one knowingly
aiding or abetting him therein, shall be ﬁned, on conviction,
not more than one thousand dollars, and imprisoned not more
than one year.

§ 3750. Subpoena for witnesses in all proceedings under this Wanam
chapter, may be issued by the court or Judge granting the
writ, or before whom the same is returnable, or by any Justice ‘
of the Peace. [Act 1823, ch. 15, § 1.]
§ 3757. Witnesses thus summoned are subject to the same wiaism-,,

of perjury as if administered in the mode prescribed by this
chapter, unless the form is objected to at the time.

[Ib.]

Where a statute prescribes a form of oath, it is not necessary to the validity
of the oath that it should pursue the exact words of the Act. The adoption of
such a principle would be ruinous to society. Perjury and slander would often

ﬁnd in slight verbal variances from the prescribed forms of oaths, the means of
escape from the coudign punishment which justice invokes. Unquestionably an
an oath administered substantially according to the prescribed form will be valid,
and if taken falsely, the party will be guilty of perjury. Sharp v. Wilhite, 2
Humph. 434, 437. If u party be sworn with the uplifted hand, though not con
scientiously scrupulous of swearing on the Gospels, and depose falsely, he will be

guilty of perjury. State v. Wisenliurst, 2 Hawks. 468; cited and approved in
Doss v. Birks, l1 Humph. 432, which cites also to the same effect, Whart. Cr.
Law, 473; Coin. v. Knight, 12 Mass. 274, and Campbell v. People, 8 Wend. 636.
The practice in this State has been to administer the oath with uplifted hand and

solemn appeal to God, without inquiring of the witness whether he is conscien
tiously scrupulous of swearing on the Gospels; and such oath has been uniformly

regarded as legal and binding. ll Humph. 482; recognized in Looper V. Bell,
§ 1 Head, 378, 376.—See Q 4973, and note.
§ 3777. Every written contract, instrument, or signature pur
porting to be executed by the party sought to be charged, his

partner, agent, or attorney in fact, and constituting the foun
dation of an action, is conclusive evidence against such party,
unless the execution thereof is denied under oath.
[Act 1817, ch. 86, § 2; 1819, ch. 27, § 4; 1819, ch. 42, §1.]
See i 2909. For form of plea of non est factum see Q 2940, Form No. 1, and
note.—The foundation of the action is the note, bond, judgment, or other ev
idence of debt, introduced to make out the pls.intiﬂ"s case. Douglas v. Cross, 6
Cold. 416, 419. A receipt in the nature of an agreement, by which the defend
ant acknowledges having received two promissory notes, and agrees to have them
properly endorsed and retumed to the plaintiif, if specially declared on, is the

foundation of the suit, and is conclusive against the defendant, unless denied under
oath.

Ib.

And so, where suit was brought on a written agreement by which the

defendants acknowledged having received three hogsheads of tobacco, which they were to freight to New Orleans, and if the same bore inspection, pay the plaintiﬂ‘
the price they should sell for, on their return,--this instrument was clearly the
foundation of the action, and not having been denied on oath, full proof prime fa‘
cie, to entitle the plaintiff to recover. Jones v. Walker, 5 Yerg. 427, 481. This
section, [as well as Q 2909,] has no application to s ease where, in a suit by the
uselgnee of n. note against the original payee, the assignment is drawn in question.
In such a case, the plea of non-assignment without oath is proper; or if the suit

originated before a justice where the pleadings are or: terms, the plaintiﬂ' must
prove the assignment without its being denied by plea. Stone v. Bond, 1 Heisk
§ 425-7; Richardson v. Cato, 9 Hnmph. 464. To permit proof, under the plea of
nowassumpsit, that the endorsement is not genuine, would be a violation of the
statute. Knott v. Planters’ Bank, 2 Hnmph. 498; Smith v. Wallace, 4 Yerg. 572
Burtlen of proof on plea ofnon est‘ factum.—Under this plea, where it alleges

in general terms that the instrument sued on is not the defendant's act and deed:
[see Roberts v. State, cited under Q 2940, forrn No 1,] the burden of proof is upon
the plaintiff. Brown v. Phelsn, 2 Swan, 629, 631 ; Carter v. Turner, 6 Sneed, 178,
§ 182, and Hill v. Scales, '7 Yerg. 410, where the charge of the Circuit Judge to this

eﬂect was not called in question.

On the contrary the unreported case of Union

Bank v. Horkins, Brownsville, 1868, and Bumpas v. Timms, 8 Sneed, 459, are
cited in King's Digest, Q 9096, as deciding the general rule to be that the burden
of proof is on the defendant to establish his plea; but this is clearly not the law.

nor does Bumpas v. Timms, so decide. 1 Greenl. Ev. Q 74 etuq.

But on the other

hand, the general rule is_thst upon a special plea of non eat fadum which admits
the execution of the instrument, but seeks to avoid it on some ground aside from
the execution, the onus is on the defendant. Carter v. Tumer, 5 Sneed, 178, 182 ;
Brown v. Phelan, 2 Swan, 629, 681 ; Bumpas v. Timms, 8 Sneed, 459, 461. As
where the plea admits the signing and sealing of the instrument, but denies that
it was ever delivered to the plaintiﬂ‘. 5 Sneed, 178, 180. Or where it admitted
the signing and delivery of the instrument, as a promissory note, but alleged that
the same was afterwards altered, without defendant's knowledge, consent or au
thority, by aﬂixing a seal to his signature. 2 Swan, 629, 630. Or where it aver
red that after the execution and delivery of the note, its date was altered without
defendant’s consent. 3 Sneed, 459-60.-And so the denial on oath, in a petition

for supersedeas to quash a justice‘s execution issued against the petitioner as
stsyor, that the petitioner ever executed an order authorizing the justice to enter

his name as stayor, is in effect a plea oﬂ‘ non est factum, and throws the burden
of proof upon the party seeking to establish his liability. McDowell v. Turney,
§ 5 Sneed, 225, 228.

But if the alteration appears on the face of the instrument,

the law imposes on the party claiming under it, the burden of explaining such al
teration. 2 Swan, 681; 1 Greenl. Ev., Q 564.

Passed March 23, 1860. Tool: eifect May 28, 1860.—For a. similar statute see
the Alabama Code, of 1852, Q 2281.—The rule before this statute was : If one of
two partners be sued ona partnership demand, he must plead the matterin abate
ment, and set out the names of the partners, so that the plaintiff may, it‘ need be,
sue them together; but if one of two partners bring a suit upon a partnership

demand, the defendant may take advantage of it at the trial of the cause; for be
may not know, until it comes out in evidence, that the fact is so. Coffee v. East

§ 3780. An account on which action is brought, coming from

the correctness of the account, and the certiﬁcate of a State com
missioner annexed thereto, or the certiﬁcate of a Justice, with

the clerk’s certiﬁcate that such Jnstice is an acting Jnstice with
in his county, is conclusive evidence against the party sought
to be charged, unless he shall, on oath deny the account.

[Act 1819, ch. 25, § 1.]
Reason lmdpolicy of this Act, “ toaﬂ'ord the creditor an easy and cheap means
of collecting his debts when they were justly due, and no defense existed.” live
v. Baslrett, 8 Humph. 340, 842; Western and Atlantic Railroad Co. v. Head, 
Sneed, 107, 110.
It was "to enable tho plaintilf in such cases to have judgment

without further proof, unless defendant would deny the account on oath, and thus
give him notice that he must be prepared to prove the correctness of the account."
Brown v. Stabler, 1 Heisk. 444-5.

C‘on:t1-action.--This Act should not beconstrued in parimaleria with the book
debt law, [next section,] but should be taken to mean that which its terms import,
and no more. 8 Humph. 341-48. It intended to put proven accounts on the
same footing with notes, bills of exchange, eto., in respect of the pica of non at

factum under the Act of 1819, ch. 27, Q 4,
Anderson, 1 Heisk. 1, 8. Hence
Ejed of denial on oatIt.—If the account is unjust, the defendant may deny it on
oath, and this neutralizes the eﬂ'ect of the plaintiffs oath, makes up an issue be
tween them, and puts the plaintiﬁ‘ to his proof as effectually as though the Act
had not existed. 8 Humph. 342-3; Brien v. Peterman, 8 Head, 498, 500. And where the justice of the account is denied on oath, the account itself cannot be
received in evidence. 8 Head, 498-9. And where judgment was rendered by a justice in favor of the plaintiff, on a sworn account, and the defendant removed
the cause into the Circuit Court by certiorm-t', the denial in the petition for cartin
rari of the justness of the account, was suiﬁcient as a matter of pleading to put
the plaintiff to his proof in the Circuit Court. Brown v. Stabler, 1 Heisk. 444 ;
citing McDonald v. Turney, 5 Sneed, 225, which see, under {Q 2909 and B777.
And it seems that where two persons are sought to be charged jointly, and are
alike interested in the defense, the denial of one is equal to the denial of both.

§ 8 Head, 499.
Eject of probate.—Where it was sought to charge a person as surviving part
ner, and it appeared that the business of the ﬁrm was conducted in the name of
the deceased partner alone, and the sworn account was made out against him in
his individual capacity, and the defendant simply plead nil debit without denying
the account on oath, it was held that the sworn account not denied on oath did
not have the effect to charge the defendant as surviving partner without proof of
the partnership, and that it was A ﬁrm debt. Trundle v. Edwards, 4 Sneed, 572.
That the sworn account per as, is not only evidence of the debt, but of the char
acter in which the defendant is sued, or ground of his liability, is, the court say,
untenable. Ib., 375.
Want may be embraced in ﬂu account.—0nly matters arising ea: conlracm, by
dealings between the parties, and which are properly matters of account. The
remedy does not extend to torts. W. & A. Railroad Co. v. Mead, 4 Sneed, 107
Thus, the Act does not extend to an account for the value of goods lost by u com
mon carrier. Ib. But if the account embraces the proper subject matter, it makes
no difference whether the items included on it be many or one. Thus, an account
for a balance due on price of a horse, is within the statute. Hunter v. Anderson,
§ 1 Heisk. 1.

How declared on; Profert.—It being the intention of the statute to put ac
counts proven in this manner on the some footing as notes, bills, etc., in respect
of the plea of mm est factum, as stated in Cave v. Baskett, 3 Humph. 842, it is
necessary that the action should be brought on the proven account; that the
declaration should state that the account is an account from another county or

State, proven under this section of the Code; and profert should be made of the
account. Unless this is done, the account is not admissible as evidence.
er v. Anderson, 1 Heisk. 1. See Q 2898, and note.

Denial, whcnﬁled.—In Brien v. Peterman, 3 Head, 498, 500, where the sworn
account was ﬁled with the declaration, and the denial on oath made nearly twelve
months afterwards, and only one day before the trial, and the plaintiff did not ask
for a continuance, but elected to go to trial, he was not entitled to a new trial on
the ground of surprise. But the court in Hunter v. Anderson, 1 Heisk. 1, 4,
while approving this ruling, hold that the defendant must ﬁle his sworn denial
with his plea to the plnintiﬁ‘s declaration, ifnless he should be permitted by the
court to ﬁle it at a subsequent period; which the court may allow in the exercise
of its discretion.

testator or intestate, for such articles as shall be proved in man
ner aforesaid. [Ib.]
Policy of the book debt lmn.—It was intended to afford mechanics and shop
keepers the means of collecting their small accounts where there was no witness
by whom they could be proved. For the amount limited, it would afford ample
remedies for persons of this class ; for where the value would exceed $75, a wit»
ness could most usually be found to prove some part of it. When thus proved

by the book, it becomes, to use the language of the act, " good evidence; " and
so strong did they suppose they were making the proof, that they deemed it nec
essary in the fourth section to provide that the defendant might be permitted to
oppose the same by other legal evidence. To make a man a witness in his own

case, so that unless the defendant could establish by other legal evidence that the
work was not done, or the articles not delivered, the plaintilf’s oath should be
the sole ground of a judgment in his favor, was a dangerous extension of the law
of evidence. It was very important therefore to limit the amount to which such

proof might be made, and the time within which a claim which was to be thus
supported should he brought forward. Cave v. Baskett, 8 Humph. 840.-And
now the rule of evidence known as “the book debt law, " and which is declared
in the above sections, is so far extended or rather superseded, as to admit parties,
except in proceedings by or against executors, administrators or guardians, to

testify, without regard to the character of the claim, the amount involved, or any
limitation of time. The provisions of Q 8818::-8813 e, are not, however, to be
construed as repealing the book debt law. Q 8786 a.
C0nstructio1L—-In the, construction of Q 8780, the book debt law has no appli

cation. 8 Humph. 340; note to Q 8780.—'l‘he book debt law is in no just sense
a statute of limitations, and hence the suspension of the statute of limitations from
Hay 6, 1861, to Jan. 1, 1867, did not operate to extend the two years within which
anaccount under this statute may be proven. Neville v. Northcutt, 7 Cold. 294, 297.

—This statute has always, both in North Carolina and Tennessee, received aliberal
construction for the advancement of the remedy. Irwin v. Jordan, 7 Humph. 167.
Thus it has been held that an account for the hire of a slave or a horse may be
proved under the statute. 7 Humph. 169 ; Easley v. Eakin, Cooke, 888. Where

there is no demurrer to a bill in dtancery, the chancellor may hear and determine
the cause upon the same principles as a court of law. In this view, perhaps, the
complainant may avail himself of the book debt law, upon making out a mac strid

ly within its provisions.

Johnson v. Draper, 8 Head, 549.

And it would seem

from Nevillev. Northcutt, 7 Cold. 294, 296, that all the prerequisites of the statute
must be complied with. But although the plaintilf is not competent to prove his
own account, if he can prove it by another witness, yet if the defendant waive the
question of competency, the evidence of the plaintiff becomes material, perjury may
be assigned thereon, or an action will lie for slanderous words imputing perjury

thereon. If the oath be substantially in accordance with the prescribed form, it
will be valid, and if taken falsely the party will be guilty of perjury. Sharp v.
Wilhite, 2 Humph. 484, 487.

There must be a speciﬁcation in the aﬁidavit or act

accompanying it, of Use items making up the account.

Where a complainant in

ehaneery failed to establish his account by a discovery from the defendant, he
could not prove it to the extent of seventy-ﬁve dollars by his own oath under the
book debt law, withoutaetting forth the items embraced in no much of his ao

connt as is thus proved.

§ 8 Head, 550.

And it seems from an earlier case, that csaram KINDS or nvmmwcs, srrscr msnsor.
a lumping charge without A hill of particulars, although proved to be in the hand
writing of a deceased clerk, would not be good.

McClure v. Byrd, 1 Tenn. 21.

The rule being that the hand-writing of a deceased clerk may be proved as evi
dence that certain charges were made by him. Ib. If the defendant avail himself
of the credits stated in the oath of the plaintiff, he must also admit the debits ; he

cannot take one part of the statement without the other. Ib.
Where the plaintiﬂ‘ swears, as the statute requires, that he has no other means

ofproving his book account except his own oath, etc, his book is evidence, and
if the jury ﬁnd for him upon it, the judgment shall not be arrested or s new trial
granted, merely because it may appear that he might have otherwise proven his
lccount, as that could not make the verdict erroneous; but the plaintiff would bo

guilty of a perjury, for false swearing. Irwin v. Jordan, '1 Humph. 167-8.

Plainttf may be cross-ea:amined.—The party availing himself of the statute vol
untarily places himself in the position of a witness, and the other party has the
right to cross-examine as to each item ofthe account, thearticles delivered, the time,

place, person to whom delivered, price, and every material fact. Johnson v. Price,

§ 3787. The certiﬁcate of a notary public in or on his protest, (Jertiﬂcatn of
that he has given the parties to negotiable paper notice of the my"
dishonor, is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the cer
tiﬁcate ; and in like manner, entries in his books to the same
eﬁect, are prima facie evidence, in case of his death, of the facts
therein stated.

[Act 1819, ch. 49, § 2; 1820, ch. 25, §4; 1835, ch. 11, § 3.]
This section repeats the provisions of Q 1800, l801.—-See Smith v. McMannus,

§ 7 Yerg. 47 7, 485.

The notary is a public oﬂicer, and when he certiﬁes that he

has done an oﬁicial act, it must be presumed that he has done it correctly, unless
some statute or rule of law prescribes a particular mode, until the contrary ap
pears. lf the fact of notice be stated by the notary, either in or on the protest,
it is sufficient, without stating the time when the notice was given, the post-ojics
to which it was sent, and all the particulars necessary to make out a good legal
notice under the law merchant. Golladay v. Bank of the Union, 2Head, 57, 59;
quoted and approved in Caruthers v. Harbert, 5 Cold. 862, 867. If the body of
the protest recite, “ I then notiﬁed the drawers and endorsers, " this is suﬁicient.

§ 2 Head, 67.

But the presumption is subject to rebuttal hy proof contradicting

the notary's certiﬁcate ; as where the certiﬁcate recited that the notice was left at
the endorser’s oﬂice in Memphis, it was rebutted by showing that the endorser
had no oﬂice in Memphis at the time. 5 Cold. 868. The domicil or sleeping
room of a judge, in the third story of a building, the judge being nearly all the
time engaged in his duties at the court house, is not his place of business within
the meaning of the rule laid down in Bank of Columbia v. Lawrence, I Pet. 582.

Ib.

If the certiﬁcate in its body show that the notices were deposited in the

post-otlice on the day of the protest, it will be good, although it do not show by
its date that it, (the certiﬁcate,) was made on the day of protest. Union Bank v.
Holcomb, 5 Humph. 683. But a certiﬁcate endorsed on a protest more than a
year after the protest was made, stating that the notice was given at the time of

making the protest, is not embraced either in the words or meaning of the stat
ute, and cannot be received as evidence. Winchester v. Winchester, 4 Humph.
Ill. And a memorandum or endorsement, without date, made on the back of a
protest, by the notary ; thus, “ Notices of the within protest put in the post-ofﬁce
at Jackson, addressed," etc.,--the body of the certiﬁcate not showing the date of the notice, was held inadmissible, because it did not show that notice had been

given in time, and could not have assisted other proof that might have been intro
duced to establish the time when notice was given; for evidence to prove the time
would necessarily establish the notice. Hagler v. Mchleans, 9 Yerg. 278.

Entry in noiary’s book.—An entry on the margin of a notary's ofiicial boolr,
opposite the protest in these words, “ Indorser duly notiﬁed in writing Septem
ber 1, 1821,” is admissible in evidence, thenotary being dead, to show the fact of
notice, and will be suﬂicient when coupled with proof of the notar_v‘s prompt hab
it of business. Bell v. Perkins, Peck, 261. And so, an entry on the margin ofa
notary's official book, opposite the protest in these words, “ Indorser duly noti
ﬁed, W. Perkins, N. P." which entry was made by the notai-y‘s daughter and by
his instructions, was held admissible as evidence, to prove notice, the notary be

ing dead; and when coupled with proof of the notary's prompt habit of giving no
tice of protests, sutﬁcicnt. McNeil v. Elam, Peck, 268.
Oiher eviden¢c.—An entry on the notary’s book, with the notary‘s testimony
that he believed that he had given the notice because he had so entered it on his
book, is good evidence. Bank of Tenn. v. Cowan, 7 Humph. 70. Where the cer
tiﬁcate on the protest was in the hand-writing of s clerk of the notary, and the
clerk testiﬁed that it was his business to deliver thenotices ofprctest, and that it was
his habit to make such entries at the time of delivery of thenotices; that he had no

recollection of giving the notice of protest to the endorser; but from the fact of see
ing his endorsement to that elfect on the protest, he presumed he had, and was

satisﬁed in his own mind that he had given the notice as stated in his certiﬁcate
on the protest,—this was suﬂicient evidence of the notice.

in operation from its passage. If the new Constitution, Art. 2, § 20, repeals §
§ 162 of the Code, then this Act took effect August 7, 1870, or forty days alter its

passage. Otherwise according to Day v. McGinnis, 1 Heisk. 310, it did not take

Saunders v. Harris, 5 Humph 345. If the original is in possession of the party
oﬁering the oﬂice copy, the copy is not admissible. 5 Hnmph. 345. And see
§ 2 King's Dig., Q 6070 ct seq. Public records themselves are proved by examined

copies. 1 Greenl. Ev., § 91. As to Oﬁte co]-n'es the rule is, that ifit is made the
duty of the oﬁcer by law to furviislt copies, they are admitted in all courts un
der the same jurisdiction, and in the United States an oﬂicer having the legal cos‘
tody of public records, is es: oﬂicio competent to certify copies of their contents.
§ 1 Greenl. Ev., {Q 507, 485, and note.—Original public records cannot be brought
into court and produced in evidence, because, by the law of this State, the jury
are to carry with them when they retire, all such records as are given them in evi

loc v. Wilson, 2 Tenn. 59. Therefore a book of entries of land cannot of itself
be given in evidence. Ib. In another case it is said: “It has been permitted to use
the original papers in suits as records, [evidence,] where they were of the same court
in which the trial was had. When ﬁrst attempted, it had been best to have rejected
them, not because they were not the best evidence, but because of the danger to the

records of the country.
Doubtiug, as we do, the propriety of such a practice, we
will, however, not reverse for such a cause; the objection does not go to the mer
its. Nichol v. Ridley, 5 Yerg. 68, 65.—A duly certiﬁed copy ofa paper belonging
to a public oiﬁcer may, under the above section, be read in evidence on behalf
of the State in a criminal prosecution. Reeves v. State, 7 Cold. 96. This view
of the question is not in conﬂict with the bill of rights, which provides that the
prisoner shall meet the witness face to face. [See Const. of Tenn. Art. 1, Q 9,

note (c).]

In such a case the paper is the witness, and the Code only substitutes

a certiﬁed copy instead of the original paper.

Ib., 101.

and expenses in bringing a prisoner from another State to this State for trial, au

certiﬁed by the Comptroller, may be read in evidence under the above section. Ib.

federal courts of the United States, may be proved by a copy
thereof, attested by the clerk, under his seal of oﬁice, ifhe have
one, together with a certiﬁcate of a Judge, Chief Justice, or pre
siding magistrate, that the attestation is in due form of law.

See Const. U. S. Art. 4, Q 1; Act of Congress of May 26, 1790; Act of Con-,
gross of March 27, 1804; VoL 1 of this work, pp. 175-6, and note. It seems to
be generally agreed that the method of authentication prescribed by the Act of
Congress is not exclusive of any other which the States may see proper to adopt.
Colfee v. Neely, 2 Heisk. 804, 809; citing 1 Greenl. Ev., Q 505, and note 1;
Brightly’s Digest of laws, p. 265. The Act of Congress, ante, p. 175, provides

that the authentication shall be made by “the attestation oi" the clerk and the
seal of tits court, if there be a seal," etc. It is questioned whether there is any
distinction between the seal of the court and the seal of the clerk as oﬁicer of the
court; but if there is, an attestation by the clerk under his seal of oﬂice wolld be
good by the express words of the above section of the Code, and it is not neces.
sary in such a case for the Judge to certify that there is no public seal of oﬂice in
his court. 2 Heisk. 809, 810. If the seal of the court is aﬂixed to a record from

another State, it is immaterial whether it is aﬂixed to the certiﬁcate of the Judge
or to that of the clerk. Foster v. Taylor, 2 Tenn. 191 ; 2 Heisk. 310. But see
contra, 1 Greenl. Ev., Q 506; Turner v. \Vashington, 8 Wash. 126. If the judg

ment of another State has the etfect of record evidence in the courts bf the Stats
from which it is certiﬁed, it will have the same eﬂ‘ect in the courts of any other
State; and a plea of nil debit to an action brought upon such a judgment in an.
other State, is bad. Mills v. Duryee, 7 Crsnch, 488. And see Leland v. Wilkin
son, 6 Pet. 817; United States v. Johns, 4 Dali. 412; Ferguson v. Harwood, 7
Cranch, 408; Drummond v. Magruder, 9 Cranch, 122. In the absence of all con
trary proof, the annexation of the seal to the exempliﬁcation must be presumed to
have been done by a person having custody of the same, and competent to do

the act.

United States v. Amedy, ll Wheat. 892. Unless the record of judgment

show a service of process or an appearance by the defendant, it is not evidence
against him. Buford v. Hickman, Hemp. 232. But the record is conclusive, al
though it appear that the suit was commenced by attachment of property, if the
defendant afterward appeared and made defense.
Mnyhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat
§ 129. The certiﬁcate must be authenticated by the presiding J udgc: a certiﬁcate

by one signing himself “ one of the Judges" is not sufficient.

Stewart v. Gray,

Hemp. 94; Gardner v. Lindo, 1 Cranch. C. O. 78. ..The record is not admissible
if the certiﬁcate of the presiding Judge omit to state that the attestation is “in

due form of law," Trigg v. Conway, Hemp. 688. The defendant cannot plead
in bar any fact which contradicts the record sued on. Field v. Gibbs, Pet. O. C.
§ 74; Blount v. Darrah, 4 Wash. C. C. 667; Turner v. Washington, 8 Wash. C. C.
§ 126.
It is said that the judgment of the court of another State can be impeac.-hed——

§ 1. For want ofjurisdiction.
§ 2. For fraud. Coffee v. Neely, 2 Heisk. 304, 810, reviewing numerous authori
ties. And it is held that proceedings in this State upon a judgment of another

State may be enjoined for any cause which would authorize an injunction against
ajudgment of one of our own courts. Wilson v. Robertson, 1 Tenn. 266; Win
chester v. Jackson, 3 Hayw. 305 ; S. C., Cooke, 420 ; Glasgow v. Lowther, Cooke,
§ 464. And see Estes v. Kyle, Meigs, 84. The rule, however, stated in a later case is, that a judgment rendered in one State in pursuance of the laws thereof, is to be
regarded as absolutely binding upon the citizens of every other State until it is
set aside by the tribunal rendering it, or reversed on error.

Topp v. Mallory, 2

Swan, 184. But this is to be understood of cases where the court rendering the
judgment hadjurisdiction. Ib., 187. And is now limited to cases free from fraud.
§ 2 Heisk. 312-318.

And in a suit at law in this State upon the judgment of the

court of another State, a plea of fraud is agogd plea. Ib.

of that State having provided that it should be received as evidence in the tribunals
of Kentucky.

Coﬂee v. Neely, 2 Heisk. 804, 811.

The weight of authority is

that the courts do not judicially know the laws of a sister State. Editor's note, 2
Tenn. 191, where Richard v. Hicks, 1 Tenn. 207; Wilson v. Smith, 5 Yerg. 399,
and Stephens v. Bowman, 9 Humph. I546, are cited to this point. The ﬁrst case
holds that the courts of this State are not bound to know the laws of another
State as they are our own ; that they are not presumed to know the laws of other
countries, and that they must be shown when required; but this rule does not

apply to grants of land made in this State by North Carolina before the separation,
as to which our courts are bound to know whether they have all the legal requis
ites. 1 Tenn. 208. The second case above quoted has reference to the laws of
Missouri before it became a part of the Union, that is, while it was Spanish terri
tory; and of them it says, they should he proved asfacts from the best sources,
such as eminent jurists, and other legal characters who have had opportunities to
become experienced in them, as well as by the public documents of the country.
The same evidence in regard to the construction and practice upon the written
laws made since the acquisition of the countrg by the United States, might be very
proper and useful. 5 Yerg. 899. This case seems to recognize the distinction
between the proof offoreign laws and those ofa sister Slate of the Union, since
stated and discussed in 1 Greenl. Ev., QQ 486, 487,488, 489, 504. The third case
above cited held that the various North Carolina acts which, as was shown to the
court, had been passed from time to time down to the year 1831, extending the
statutory limitation of one year within which deeds of sale of slaves were required
to be registered, would not be presumed to have been continued down to the year
§ 1846 ; and thatit was incumbent on theparty seeking the beneﬁt of such supposed
laws to produce them, and where such a deed had been registered more than a

year after its execution, the mere fact of registration would not be prime: facie
evidence that the registration was authorized by law. 9 Humph. 548. In another
case it is said that the court will either recur to its own knowledge of the judiciary

system of a sister State, or look into their printed Statutes, although those laws
were not produced below.

Foster v. Taylor, 2 Tenn. 191.

As to how far a court

can act upon its ownlmowledge of the laws of a foreign State, see 1 Greenl. Ev.,
§ 488a. The general rule adopted by the courts of other States and the Supreme
Court of the United States, is said to be that a printed volume purporting on the
face of it to contain the laws of a sister State is admissible as prima facie evi
dence to prove the statute laws of that State. 1 Greenl. Ev., Q 489, citing many
authorities. But in Texas, the book must purport to be published by authorily.

Martin v. Payne, 11 Tex. 292.
And in Massachusetts, the words:

“ By author

ity of the State. Men-iﬁeld v. Robbins, 8 Grey, 160.

[Provz'decl, however, that this Act shall not be so construed

as to give colored persons the right to vote, hold oﬂice or sit

by virtue of the provision of the ninth section of the Amend
ed Constitution, ratiﬁed February 22, 1865.
[Act 1865-6, ch. 18.]
This Act was passed January 25, 1866; but according to the doctrine of Day

v. McGinnis, 1 Heisk. 810, it did not take effect until April 21, 1867.
So far as it relates to colored persons, the Act of Congress above referred to,
isthe Act of July 2, 1863, 5 S; 13 Stat. 351; 2Bright. p. 204, Q 6. So far as it
relates to this subject, its language is as follows:
“In the courts of the United States, there shall be no exclusion of any witness
on account of color.”

A: to Indians, the only general Act of Congress in force at the time of the pas
sage of the above Act is believed to have been the Act of March 15, 1864, Q I ;
§ 13 Stat. 29; 2 Bright. p. 274, Q 29; which made Indians competent as witnesses
in cases arising under that Act, which prohibited the sale or gift of liquor to In
dians, or the introduction of liquor into the Indian country.

The preceding section 3808, is therefore repealed aa to persona of color, but is
possibly still in force as to Indians, or persons of mixed Indiun blood.

§ 77:0 proviso to the above section, so far as relates to the right to vote is re
pealed by the Constitution of 1870, Art. 4, Q I ; ante, p. 99. So far as it relates
to the service of colored persons on juries it is also repealed by the Act of l867—_8,

§ 3810. A nominal plaintiff, or naked trustee, shall not be ggminl-ippnu

In Anderson v. Bradie, 7 Yerg. 297, it was held that the Act of1825, ch’. 29,
[M 2795, 2858, 3200,] established no new rule of evidence, and did not render the
nominal plaintiff competent as a witness. And this in Barton v. Trent,,'8 Head,
§ 167, 169, was said to have been the rule prior to the adoption of the Code, es~

tublished by repeated adjudications.

And Evans v. Gibbs, 6 Humph. 405, 407,

cited Anderson v. Bradie, as placing our courts in the category of those who en

forced the rule of exclusion on the technical and abstract ground of being a party
to the suit, without reference to the ground of interest.-The above section of
the Code was expounded in Barton v. Trent, 8 Head, 169, and Sewnnee Mining

§ 3819. Due respect shall be paid to said subpmnas ; and the
ollicer to whom they are directed, and every witness thereon
summoned, shall be under the same rules, and subject to the

§ 3820. Every witness legally bound to appear as herein di

day to day, and from term to term, until ,dischargcd by the
court, or the party at whose instance he is summoned.

[Act 1794, ch. 1, § 29.]
The common law rule that the expenses of a witness should be tendered before
he is compelled to attend is abrogated by this act of Assembly. Smith v. Bargcr,

§ 9 Yerg. 322; Witherspoon v. Killough, Mart 8: Yerg. 88 ; recognized as the settled
law in Carrcn v. Breed, 2 Cold. 465, 467. The Legislature intended that allow
ance per diam and for mileage, should be the entire compensation tg which the witness would be entitled ; and hence, the party summoning a witness is not bound
to tender his expenses as a condition precedent to his right to recover the penalty
given by the next section. 9 Yerg. 322.

“ Until discharged by the Court. "--A formal discharge by the court is not re
quired. The meaning of the statute is, that whenever aﬁnal judgment is given
which determines the cause, the witnesses are thereby discharged. A nonsuit is
a ﬁnal disposition ofa cause as completely as ajudgment on a verdict; and where
a nonsuit is taken, the witnesses have a right to consider themselves discharged,

although the nonsuit be set aside at the term at which it is taken. Cochran v.
Brown, 1 Hnmph. 329. So, it is said, that after ﬁnal judgment, the witnesses are
not bound to await the determination of a motion for new trinl, or the determin

ation of an appeal ; but a ﬁnal judgment discharges them, although a new trial is
afterwards granted, or the cause on appeal is reversed or remanded. Ib.

“ Or the party at whose instance he is summoned. ”—It seems that if the party
summoning the witness agreed with him that he need not attend, unless conven
ient, and that if not present at the trial, he should not be called out,—this, if

proved by competent testimony, would discharge the witness from liability.

Wallace v. Weir, 1 Tenn. 312. But new females are privileged from attending as

The subpoena is in the nature of a record, and the scirefacias need only set it outsub

stautiully, as in other cases.

Smith v. Burger, 9 Yerg. 322, 824.

The scire fucias

need not show that the subpoena issued to the sheaijfof the witneses’ county ; for the
subpoena would notshow such a fact, and the scirefacias recites only what appears
in the subpoena, and besides the penalty is given, whether the witness resides in the
C0uut§' in which the court sets or not. 9 Yerg. 824. Seeﬁ 3817, and uote.—But
public officers, jailers, attorneys and physicians avoid the above penalty by claim

ing excmption from being compelled to attend as witnesses at the time the sub
pcena is served, or afterwards by application to the court, in which case their de
positions may be taken. Q 8836, sub-sec. 7; 5,! 8839, $840. But if such exemp

Q 3841.

Before a ﬁnal judgment can be rendered against the witness, there must

be an actual service of the scire faciaa ; or what is equivalent, a return of two

By the original act, the witness was relieved from liability by showing his “in

the like.

Duke v. Given, 4 Yerg. 478, 480.—F0rmerly a witness proceeded against by sci. f¢., could not discharge himself by his own affidavit. 4 Yerg. 480. But
this was under the rule of evidence which excluded parties as witnessos—now
changed by Q 8818 a,etseq.-—It is a good defense to the scire facia: that the nub

take probate of witnesses’ attendance, at any time between the
commencement and the ﬁnal decision of a cause, either in va

A witness attending without being summoned cannot have his attendance taxed
in the bill of costs. He must look to the party reoucsting his attendance. Hop
kins v. VVaterhouse, 2 Yerg. 230. The fact that no subpoena can be found among
the papers, will not prevent the witness from proving his attendance; for the wit

ness has nothing to do with the return of a summons, or with its preservation
after it is returned. Where a witness has proved his attendance, the presumption
is that the record justiﬁed it. If improperly proved in term time, the law sup
poses it a public act, known to the parties, and if unauthorized for want of being
summoned, the court, on motion for that purpose, would order the attendance dis
allowed. If proved within ﬁve days after the rise of the court, before the clerk,
the presumption is that he had examined, and from the record discovered the right
to prove under the summons; Hopkins v. Waterhouse, 2 Yerg. 828. The mem

See Q 8886, sub-sec. 5.——Befo1-e the Code it was held that an aﬂidavit that a wit
ness wasa transient person, moving from place to place, and that he talked of mov
ing out of the country, would not authorize the clerk to issuea commission to take

such person's deposition, and his deposition could not be read in evidence. Turnley
v. Evans, B Humph. 222. So, in an earlier case, where it appeared that a witness
had no property, was about removingto another part of the State, and had declared
that she would not again attend court, the court said that they had no authority
to order a commission to take the deposition of a person removing from one part
of the State to another ; but under the circumstances unless consentwere given to
take the deposition, they would order a continuance. McFarland v. Moore, 1 Tenn. '
§ 32. The rule was declared to be, that where depositions are taken dc bane ease at
law, before they can be read, the party offering them must prove the death, or re
moval of the witness beyond the limits of the State; or, in case of his residence,
an incapacity to attend from indisposition ; and, in the last case, a subpoena taken
out and put into the hands of the oﬁicer, and that he did all in his power to pro~
cure the testimony in court. Coulter v. Purcell, 1 Tenn. 4'79. And see Hodg v.
Nance, l Swan, 57, 59.
- 1

But this section of the Cbde introduces a change in the law as regards the taking
of depositions of persons residing in the county in which the suit is pending. Form
erly, the deposition of witnesses livingin the county could not be taken generally,
but only in special cases upon cause shown. But the deposition of u witness, taken
under this section of the Code, may be read, although the witness is p1-esenl in court
and if the opposite party desires a further examination, he may introduce the wit
ness, treating him as the witness of the party taking the deposition. Turney v.
Oﬂicer, 3 Head, 567. See Q 3843. But where the deposition ofa witness residing

in the county has been taken under this section, if the witness /la-9 been subpmnaed
to attend by the adverse party, and is in attmdance as a witness, and the reading,
of the deposition is objected to, the deposition cannot be read, but the party who
took his deposition must, if he desires his testimony, examine him. Puryear v.
Reese, 6 Cold. 21, 27. The court say,it seems to have been held otherwise, [prob
ably referring to the case in 8 Head, above quoted], but we think this the cor
rect practice. Ib. But this rule does not apply where the witness reqides in mu
other county. In that case, the adverse party may summon him if he wishes him

examined in court, but this does not preclude the reading of hisdeposition by
the party who took it: it simply enables the party who summoned him to examine
himifhe chooses. 6 Cold. 27; Ford v. Ford, 11 Humph. 89; Car. Lawsuit,§ 814.

The party who takes and ﬁlesa deposition is not bound to read it; and if the
opposite party read it, he makes it his evidence, and it may be impeached by the
party by whom it was taken.

not be established by the certiﬁcate of the magistrate who took it, except in the

suit in which it was taken.

Ross v. Cobb, 9 Yerg, 467, 471.

Complete identity

depositions of several witnesses were taken the same day before the same com
missioner, some of them to be used in one ease, and some in another, but all con

that none of the depositions so taken could be read in either case.

False claim.

§ 3841. A false claim set up by the witness, shall in no way
affect the right of the party summoning the witness, to proceed

against him under the provisions of this Code, and the burden
of proof is on the witness, upon scire facias, to show the fact

Under the Act of 1817, where the deposition of witnesses residing in another
Bounty has been taken by the plaintiﬂ‘, and the defendant subpmnas them for

cases allowed by law, upon giving the opposite party legal no
tice of the time and place, or by ﬁling interrogatories as here

in provided.
Since the above provisions, the following decisions are presumed tobeobsolete,
or ofno value to the practitioner :—White v. Edgman, 1 Tenn. 22, note, which
held that a deposition could not be lawfully taken upon a commission issued by

a clerk, unless there was an order oi‘ court in force authorizing it; McCandless v.
Polk, 10 Humph. 617, which held that the clerk could not issue a commission, or

make an order to take depositions during the sitting of thccourt ; Dixon v. Steele,
§ 5 Hayw. 28, which related to a variance between the commission and caption of

the deposition; Edster v. Montgomery, 6 Humph. 281, which held that the oﬁi
cial statement-of the clerk that an atlidavit had been made upon which the com

mission issued, was evidence oi that fact; and Hodges v. Nance, 1 Swan, 57, 59,
which held that where an order of court directs a deposition to be taken dc bene

ease, and 'tiiB"tiommission issued by the clerk directed it to be taken absolutely,
it must be held to have been taken dc bane ease.

For, the Act of 1851-2, ch. 161,

dispensed with both order and commission, and rendered them unnecessary; and
hence where the commission was void because the name of the party taking the
deposition had never been inserted, the deposition was nevertheless good.

Hoo

ver v. Rawlings, 1 Sneed, 287.
“ Order or commission”.-—The original act read “ order," but did not contain
the word “ commission." But it was held that in dispensing with the order,-it
dispensed with the commission also; for the order is nothing more than a pre
cept directing that a commission shall issue. 1 Sneed, 289.

Oommissicms issued in blank.-—[The Act of1845-6, ch. 209, authorized either
party, his agent or attorney toﬁll up the blanks in commissions with the names of
thecommissioners, before whom thedeposition was to be taken. It was held that the
blank might be ﬁlled at any time before the deposition was taken, but not after
wards. Oliver v. Bank of Tenn., 11 Humph. 74, 76 ; McCandless v. Polk, 10 Humph.

§ 617, 623. The above named Act is also noticed in Hoover v. Rawlings, 1 Sneed, 287,
§ 289. This act appears to be omitted from the Code, and is repealed by § 41.
Nevertheless the practice which it sanctions still continues to some extent, although

some clerks have been known to refuse to issue commissions in blank. But as the
commission is unnecessary, if the party chooses to take the deposition without it,
and as a void commission will not vitiate the deposition, (1 Sneed, 287,) no harm

could probably result from issuing it in blank.—Eds.]
Caption of de
position.

§ 3848. The caption and certiﬁcate shall be substantially as
follows:

In the

Certlﬂcate '

The said witness—-i, aged
, being duly sworn, de
posed as follows:
The foregoing depositions were taken before me, as stated
in the caption, and reduced to writing by me, (or by the wit
nesses.) And I certify that I am not interested in the cause,
nor of kin or counsel to either of the parties, and that I sealed
them up and delivered them to-——-, (or put them in the post oﬂice,) without being out_of my possession, or altered
after they were taken.
§ 18

Given under my hand the

day of

Caplion.—A variance in the description of the suit between the caption ofﬁ de
position and the commission for taking it, will not be fatal, if enough appears to
enable the court to presume that the suit is, in fact, the same. Dixon v. Steele, 6
Hayw. 28. [This decision is of little value, as depositions may now be taken

without commission.

Certiﬁca1e.—It should appear by some means that the commissioner sustained
the character which the rule requires, that he was not interested, of counsel, etc.,
and that the deposition was in his hand-writing, or in that of the witness. As
soon as he appears to sustain the necessary character, the court will give credence
to all he certiﬁes, and if‘ satisﬁed by a comparison of the signature with the body,
that they are both in the same hand-writing, will be convinced ofthe requisite fact,
though it were better if expressly certiﬁed. But how is it to bc known that he is
not interested, related, or of counsel, etc. Y Hardly any one else can be able to
speak of all these requisites ; and if not otherwise suﬁicicntly proved, it cannot be
known but by his certiﬁcate. The only ground for presuming him qualiﬁed is,
that otherwise he would not have taken the deposition. But he may have not
known of the rule that disqualiﬁes him. The fact, therefore, ought to be stated
in the caption, or in some other part of the deposition, if not otherwise proved
by aﬁirmative testimony, not only that he sustains the necessary character, but
also the requisite qualiﬁcations, in not being subject to any of the disqualiﬁcations
imposed by the rule. Cross-examination by the det‘endant,_cau only prove that
he had notice of the time and place of taking the deposition, and nothing more.

Wilson v. Smith, 6 Yerg. 379, 407.

“ Reduced to writing by me,” elc.—If, on a comparison of the signature with
the body of the deposition, the court is satisﬁed that they are both in the same
hand-writing, that will be suiiicient evidence that the deposition was reduced to
writing by the oﬂicer. Wilson v. Smith, 6 Yerg. 379, 407. [But the taker of
the deposition should not be misled by these old cases, but should pursue strictly
the form of the statute. It‘, then, he make amistake or omission, the lawyers and
court will look to these cases to see whether there is any precedent under which

the deposition may be admitted.-Eds.]—See Q 3865 and note.

If a disinterested

person be selected by the taker of a deposition to write for him, in his presence,
and under his direction, it is as well as if he himself had written it. Bedford v.
Ingram, 5 Hayw. 155. But now sec § 3859.
“ Nor of kin,” etc.-It was formerly held that it was not necessary for the cer
tiﬁcate to show that the person taking the deposition was not rclatod to either of
the parties. Blair v. Bank of Tennessee, 11 Humph. 84, 88; Looper v. Bell, 1
Head, 873, 875. But this ruling is repealed by the above section.

Service of
notice.

§ 3854. The sheriff, coroner, or constable of any county in
this State, into whose hands a notice to take depositions has been
put, shall deliver a copy of such notice to the proper person in
due time, and return the original notice, with the time of de
livery marked thereon, to the court or Justice before whom
the suit is pending. [Act 1817, ch. 199, § 5; 1847-8, ch. 17.]
A return of the oﬂicer in these words, " executed this writ own the 18th of June

§ 1859," though informal, is suﬂicient evidence that the notice was served.

Bew

ley v. Cummings, 3 Cold. 282, 234. In an old case it was held that if notice he
left~at the residence of the party to be notiﬁed, and he be in the house and con

ceal himself ; or if he be in the neighborhood, it will be a suﬁlcient service of the
notice. But it will be otherwise if he be in a distant part of the State, or in an
other State. In the latter case, service must be on his attorney, and by leaving
a notice at his place of residence also. If in the State, he must be personally

served. And the ailidavit to prove notice, must State his concealment or being in
the neighborhood at the time of leaving a copy of the notice at his place of resi
dence. And it must state his being out of the State, when proof is made of notice
served on his attorney, and of leaving a. copy at the house of the principal. Wil
son v. Drake, 5 Hayw. 180.

§ 3854 a. It shall be suﬂicient to serve notice of time and
place of taking depositions upon the counsel of non-resident
parties, and such service shall have the same effect as if served

on the party himself.

§ 3855. When the witnesses reside out of the State, or over one i>.,,°:“,.,,,, upon nterfog.
hundred any ﬁfty miles from the place of trial, either party nones
may take depositions by ﬁling interrogatories with the clerk,
giving the opposite party notice thereof, who shall have ten

days thereafter to ﬁle cross interrogatories, to which rebutting
interrogatories may then be put; at any time after which the
deposition may be taken upon a certiﬁed copy of the interroga
tories, to be issued by the clerk. [Act 1827, ch. 81,§ 5.]
Where a deposition has been once taken upon interrogatories ﬁled, all the
elﬁcacy of such interrogatories is exhausted, and the party has no right to re-take
the deposition without re-ﬁling the original or additional interrogatories, and giv
ing the opposite party notice, as required by the above section.

§ 3856. If the opposite party is a non-resident, or ifjudgment ‘3)[l,I;:.."V.then
by default or pro confesso has been taken for want of appear

the clerk a copy of the interrogatories, with a memorandum of

terrogatories with the clerk as provided by section
of the Code, it shall be the duty of the clerk to give notice 01
the ﬁling of such interrogatories, to the counsel of the opposite

be a non-resident. [Act 1859-60, ch. 53, § 2.]
Passed March 9, 1860, took cifect May 6, 1860.

As to notice.--A party has the right to be present and cross-examine the wit
nesses whose depositions are sought to be taken against him, and reasonable op
portunity must be aﬂorded him to be thus present. Therefore it is not legal to
give him notice to take different depositions at diﬂ'erent places on the same day,
but the depositions will not be rejected for this cause, where it appears that he did not attend at either place, and was not prejudiced thereby. Blair v. Bank of
'l‘enn., 11 Humph. 84, 88. The notice must designate the witnesses to be examined
by name, or the deposition cannot be rend, unless it appear that the opposite
party attended and cross-examined, which would cure the defect. Robertson v.
Campbell, 1 Tenn. 172. For, to appear in person or by agent, and participate in
the taking of a deposition, is a waiver of objection for want of notice. Bedford

v. Ingram, 6 llayw. 155, 164; McNew v. Rogers, 1 Thomp. Gas. 32.

Where the

witness resides at a distant place, as two hundred miles from the place of trial, it
is lawful to allow, in the notice, two days for taking his deposition; and it may be
read, though taken on the ﬁrst day and closed up, unless it appear by aﬁidavit
that the opposite party attended on the last day for the purpose of cross-examin
ing, and could not do so by reason of the deposition having been taken and sealed,
or some other unfairness. Smith v. Cocke, 1 Tenn. 296. A deposition signed

John G. Priestly, taken upon a. notice and commission to take the deposition of
John Priestly may be read in evidence; even where the deposition related to the
execution of the bond sued on, which was attested by the witness by the name of
John Priestly, and the execution of which ins denied by the defendant by plea of
non at factum. Brooks v. Mcliean, Cook!‘ 162. Where depositions are excepted to for want of notice, unless it appear in the record, or by proof incorporated
into the bill of exceptions, that there was no notice, the Supreme Court will pre
sume that notice was regularly given. Harris v. Burris, 1 Thomp. Gas. 137.

any person acquainted with the facts, stating the contents there- '"Pl>1l¢“
of, as near as may be, and that sncli instrument has been un

intentionally lost or mislaid, and is still the property of the
person claiming under it, unpaid and unsatisﬁed.

SeeQ 2898, and note; Q 8908, and note; Q8907, and uote.—It seems to have
been the understanding that prior to this act the only remedy upon lost instru
uieuts was in equity. Gwathney v. Stump, 2 Tenn. 808; Powers v. Fitzhugli, 10
Humph. 415, 417. But in one case it was held that this statute does not confer
any jurisdiction upon the courts of law, for that existed before ; and that it only
prescribes the manner of suing upon lost instruments, or regulates the practice

thereon. Murlock v. Brown, 7 Humph. 61. For this reason it was held that a
defect in the affidavit, as where it failed to show that the bond had not been sold,
bartered, transferred, assigned or conveyed, etc., did not oust the court of jurisdic

tion, and that the aﬂidavit was hence amendable. Ib. See Q 2863, and note. But
since this act, the jurisdiction of a court of law to afford this species of relief has nev
er been questioned. Union Bank v. Osborne, 6 Humph. 818-19. The remedy at
law given by the statute, does not, however, supersede the former remedy in equity.
Carter v. Vaulx, 2 Swan, 639, 641. In pursuing the new remedy at law given by the

statute, the provisions of the statute must be observed. The profert or production of
the instrumentis dispensed with, the atﬁdavit being substituted instead thereof,
but in all other respects the suit is to be conducted in the same manner and form as
if the instrument were in the plaintiﬂ"s possession. Thus, it was held that where the
instrument sued on, a note under seal, was fraudulently withheld by the defendant

the defendant could not make an aﬂldavit of the withholding of the note and sue
on the precedent demand; and an additional reason for so holding was that the
execution of the sealed note extinguished the original consideration. Powers v.
Fitzhugh, 10 Humph. 416. The aﬂldavit may be made by an agent or attorney
oi‘ the plaiutilfinto whose possession the instrument has actually come, and by

whom it has been lost or mislaid; but it cannot be made by a party in whose
hands it has never been. Carter v. Vaulx, 2 Swan, 639, 641. [This case holds
that a person to whom a note was sent by mail, and who never received it, could
not make an aﬂidavit with regard to its loss—a ruling mﬂconceived and errone

ous by all the authorities. The loss must be accounted for by the best evidence the
nature of the case admits of. See note to Q 8907.—Eds.]
The expression “ other instruments of writing for the payment of money," in
the original act, was held to embrace an endorsement, so that a party claiming
under a lost endorsement, might sue upon it at law without profert. 6 Humph.
§ 819.

§ 3902. So also, if such instrument is wrongfully in the pos

duce, and that such instrument is the property of the person
claiming under it, unpaid and unsatisﬁed. [Ib.]
§ 3903. If the instrument is one which the law requires should
be denied under oath, the aﬁidavit produced before or at the
trial, will be suﬂicient to establish the claimant’s right, wheth
er he is plaintiff or defendant; and if denied under oath, or

otherwise legally put in issue, may be established by competent
evidence of its contents.

[Ib., §§ 1, 3.]

See Q 2898, and note; Q 3901, and note; Q 8907, and note.—Where suit was
brought on an alleged lost iudentnre of apprenticeship, proof of the loss cannot
be made by a person who by reason of his tender years at the time of the execu

tion of the indenture, could not have known any thing about it. Nor can its
contents be established by the testimony oi a chairman of the County Court, who
states that he does not know much about the matter, and who conjectures its con
tents from the usual formin such cases. Cheek v. James, 2 Heisk. 170. Nor is
proof by the clerk of a court that since the case was called for trial, he hsd ex
amined papers in his oﬂice labeled 1851, [the date of the bond,] and did not ﬁnd

the bond, proof of suﬂicient search to admit secondary evidence. Ib. Although the
necessary steps to entitle the plaintiff to recover on the lost instrument may not
have been taken, yet after plea to the merits and verdict, the judgment will not
be arrested for this cause. Lowry v. Medlin, 6 Humph. 450. The case standing
on similar grounds to a declaration upon u covenant without profert. Ib. See §
§ 2893, and note. Thus, where suit is brought on a lost instrument, the aﬂidavit,
[under the original act, veriﬁed before the court,] is annexed to and ﬁled with
the declaration, and forms part of the record as a substitute for profert; and

therefore a demurrer is a proper and convenient mode to test the suﬁiciency and
validity of the declaration, including the aﬁidavit. Carter v. Vaulx, 2 Swan, 689,
§ 641. In strictness the substance of the aﬂidnvit should be stated in the declara
tion itself; but this is not usual in practice, nor is it required. 2 Swan, 641.

Unless theaﬂidavit show that the instrument alleged to be lost has not been sold
or transferred, [and now, that it “ is still the property of the plaintiff, unpaid and
unsatisﬁed,”] it will be bad on demurrer. 2 Swan, 641. But this defect is amende

ble.

Murlock v. Brown, 7 Humph. 61; Q 2868 dug.

§ 3904. The court or Justice before whom the action is tried, ggggugyru

may, in ease recovery is had upon a lost instrument, require “"1"!”

party, and conditioned to indemnify such party against any de

mand by action on such lost instrument; and execution shall
be stayed until such bond is given. [Ib., § 6.]
If the inferior court neglect to order the stay of execution as required by the
statute, and the cause be removed for any cause into the court of errors, that

court, proceeding to render such judgment as thejinferior court should have ren
dered, will direct the stay of execution, until the bond be ﬁled.

fraudulently made away with, may be supplied, upon applica

nature of the case will admit of. [Act 1847-8, ch. 116,§1.]
SeeQ 2893, and note; 8901, and note; 8908, and note.--This provision is but
a substantial transcript of the common law applicable to lost records, or other
papers; and the ﬁrst step necessary to be taken under it, is to establish the nn
intentionnl loss or destruction of the records. This may ordinarily be done by
the evidence of the clerk, or other olﬁcer entrusted by law with the care and cus
tody of the record books, or other papers, the loss of which is sought to be sup
plied. Lane v. Jones, 2 Cold. 818-20; citingl Swan, 265; 1 Grcenl. Ev., § 509.

By the terms of the statute as well as by the principles of the common law, the loss
Of the record or other paper must be unintentional.

A voluntary destruction of

it,~would not authorize the court to admit secondary evidence of the contents,
until the party charged with the loss had repelled every inference of a fraudulent
design in its destruction. 2 Cold 320; citing Bladev. Noland, 12 Wend. 173.
If the paper might or ought to have been deposited in a public oﬂicc or other
particular place, that place must be searched. Vaulx v. Mcrriwesther, 2 Sneed,
§ 683, 686; 1 Grecnl. Ev., Q 568. Thus, an aﬂidavit of careful search among the
papers of a deceased party, to whom a dccd had been executed and delivered, was

held not suﬂicient ground for letting in secondary evidence of the contents of the
deed, unless it were also shown that the oﬂices of the county court clerk and
register had also been searched
§ 1. Because it might have been deposited thcre—thoss oiﬁccs being the places
for the acknowledgment and probate, [nnd registration] of deeds.
§ 2. Because it was shown in evidence that the parties to the deed went to the
county seat for the purpose of having it acknowledged and registered.
§ 8. Because no inquiry had been made of the personal representative or heirs

of the deceased vendee. 2 Sneed , 686-7.
Thus, where the affidavit of the clerk as to the loss of a peace warrant, stated
that the pla.intiﬂ"s attorney took it out_of his office, and he, the clerk, had not seen
it since, it was held that this rendered it indispcnsably necessary that the attorney
should be sworn, if in reach of process, and account for its non-production, before
secondary evidence of its contents could be admitted. Pharis v. Lambert, 1 Sneed,
§ 228, 231 ; cited and approved in 2 Sneed, 686. In case of the loss of n record,

the clerk of the court being the legal custodian of the record books and papers
of the court, until the loss of the record is shown by him, or satisfactory reasons
given why it cannot be so shown, the aﬁidavit of an attorney employed in the

cause is wholly inadmissible.
Sneed, 276, 278.

§ 2 Cold. 822.

Same rule in Tyree v. Magncss, 1

The general rule on the subject is, that before parol evidence

of the contents of a writing can be admitted on the ground of its loss, the party
must show that he has, with reasonable diligence, resorted to and exhausted all
the sources of information and means of discovery which were accessible lo him,
and which the nature of the case would naturally suggest. 2 Snead, 687 ; citing
§ 1 Greenl. Ev., Q 558; 1 Stark Ev., 386, 340; 6 Term R. 236; 3 Watts &: Serg.

§ 291; s Scott, ss.
But if there be no ground of suspicion that the paper has been suppressed, ordi
nary diligence to produce it will be deemed suﬂicient; and what is proper dili
gence will depend much upon the circumstances of the case. Tyree v. Magness,
§ 1 Sneed, 276, 277 ; citing 4 Phil. Ev., C & H. notes, 441. This subject is govern
ed by the leading rule of evidence which requires all facts to be established by
lhe best proof thenaturc of the case will afard. 2 Sneed, 687-8. While the
rule was in force which excluded witnesses on account oi‘ interest, the party pro
posing to prove the contents of a paper might make the aﬂidavit of its loss or des
truction. Hale v. Darter, 10 Humph. 92; 1 Sneed, 230. And, a fortiori, so
may his security for costs. 1 Snecd, 230. But where the loss can be proved by
A disinterested witness, this is better. 10 Humph. 93. The loss of the record
or other paper being established to the satisfaction of the Court, it is then, and
not till then, competent for the court, upon proper application, to direct, by an
Order of record, which should show the grounds on which it is predicated, that the

lost paper or other record be supplied by the best evidence the nature of the case
will admit of. The substitute must be in substantial conformity to the original.
§ 2 Cold. 320. The proof of unintentional loss, and the order of court to snpplyit by
substituting other pleadings, papers, etc., for the original, being entered of record,

the next inquiry is, as to the character of the proof by which the lost record or
other paper can be supplied; the statute, as well as the common law, requiring
it to be done by “ the best evidence the nature of the case will admit of.” What
this character of evidence is, in s. given case, is not always a questionfree from diffi

culty; but the clearest and most satisfactory rule of law deducible from the Ameri
can authorities, seems to be the following: If, from the nature of the case itself,
it is manifest that a more satisfactory kind of secondary evidence exists, the
party will be required to produce it; but where the nature of the case does not of

itself disclose the existence of such better evidence, the objector must not only
prove its existence, but must also prove that it was known to the other party in
season to have been produced at the trial. 2 Cold. 320-21 ; citing 1 Greenl.Ev.,
Q 84, note 2. This rule of evidence is, in most cases, of easy application. The
very nature of the fact to be proved, generally discloses the existence of some
writing or memorandum of an oﬂicial character by which it can be proved; and
in every such instance, the writing must be produced before the mere memory of
witnesses can be resorted to, to show the contents of a record, or other paper.

The law is justly jealous of the memory ofwitnesses when they come to speak of
the contents of a written instrument which they have merely read; and hence it
has been holden, where the record books were burnt or mutilated, or lost, that
the clerk’s docket, and the notes or journal of the presiding Judge, were the next
best evidence of the contents of the record, and must be produced in preference

to the mere parol evidence of witnesses. 2 Cold. 821. In this and the like class
of cases, the law by its presumptions, generally indicates the existence of the next
best evidence, and the place where it can be found.

But it sometimes happens

that there is no legal presumption of the existence of other and better secondary
evidence; and in such cases any proof is received which is not inadmissible by

the rules of evidence, subject, however to be objected to, on the ground that other
and better evidence was previously known to the party proposing to supply the

lost record or other paper, and which he might by proper diligence have pro
duced.
§ 4
Under the above statute it is held-—

§ 1. The lost record or other paper can only be supplied in the court in which
the cause is pending, to which the paper belonged, or of which the record is a
part. 2 Cold. 322; Graves v. Keaton, 8 Cold. 8, 12; and see Tyree v. Magness,

§ 1 Sneed,276,278.
§ 2. N_o paper can be supplied under the above section, unless it has been “ ﬁled.”
Baker v. Mayor & Aldermen of Mclifinnville, 2 Heisk. 117. Papers which have
not been ﬁled, cannot be supplied under the above section, after a cause has been

determined, by proof that they were read at the hearing.

The Chancery Court

has no power thus to manufacture records from the uncertain memory of witness
es after s. cause has been determined. Mullins v. Aiken, 2 Heisk. 635, 550.

§ 3. The provisions of this section were intended only to enable a party during
the pendcncy of a suit, to supply any record, proceeding or paper which had beep
ﬁled in the action, and had been lostor destroyed, or fraudulently made sway with

and which he might conceive necessary to a correct adjudication of his rights in such action, and not to the supplying of a ﬁnal judgment which had been de
stroyed. The proper practice is, -where the record of a judgment has been lost,
for the plaintiﬁ‘, if he desires execution thereon, to apply to the court where the
judgment was rendered, for an execution; and upon proof satisfactory to the court

of the rendition of the judgment, and that the record of it is lost, execution should
be awarded. Faust v. Echols, 4 Cold. 397.
§ 4. Such application must be accompanied by satisfactory proof that the record
or paper has been lost or made away with as provided in the statute. 8 Cold. 12;
§ 2 Cold. 822; Galbraith v. McFarland, 8 Cold. 267, 277. And see 2 Sneed, 688;
§ 1 Sneed, 228; 1 Sneed, 276.
§ 6. The question whether there is a reasonable presumption that the paper has

been lost, being a preliminary question, is to be determined by the Judge, and
not by the jury. 1 Sneed, 277.
§ 6. There must then be an order of the court directing the lost paper or reo
ord to be supplied by secondary evidence. 2 Cold. 222-8; 3 Co'ld. 277. Q“
§ 7. This being done, there must be an order that the supplied paper be substi

tuted for the original. 2 Cold. 223 ; 3 Cold. 277.
Remanding to s11pply.—Where the response to a certiorari shows that the
portion of the record as to which the diminution has been suggested, has been

lost, the Supreme Court will remand the cause to supply the same. Seay v.
Hughes, 6 Sneed, 166. But the court will not remand to supply where it appears
that the papers desired were never made a part of the record by being ﬁled in the
court below. Mullins v. Aiken, 2 Heisk. 686, 662.

themselves directly to the frailties of our nature, and guard us against trusting
our own hearts, where relationship or preconceived opinions are involved; and

warn us oi‘ the fact that judges of every grade are but human, subject to be swayed
by the same passions and prejudices that inﬂuence other men. Were the law
otherwise, judicial oﬂlcers would be exposed to a thousand surmises and suspi
cions, which, whether just or unjust, would weaken the power of the law itself,
and tend to corrupt the channels of its impartial administration. The courts of

all grade: ought to set their faces against all violations of the Cmslitution ; and
none more imperatively demands their scrupulous regard than the one under
consideration.

Reams v. Kearns, 5 Cold. 217, 220.

Whereachancellor had been

counsel for a complainant in a cause in which property had been sold under decree, and a note with security taken for the payment of the purchase money, it
was held that the chancellor was incompetent to render a judgment on motion of
the clerk and master against the surety for the purchase money, and that such a
judgment was a mere nullity. Ib.—Waterhouse v. Martin, Peck, 374,—a very in
structive case, discusses at length the question of incompetency by reason of con

sanguinity or atiinity, at common law, and under the Constitution of 1796, Art. 6,
Q 8, and holds—
'
§ 1. That where the bench consists of several Judges, and the competency of one
of them is questioned, it is a question to be settled by the Judges present, and not

alone by the Judge whose competency is questioned.
§ 2. That a Judge who is confessedly incompetent by reason of being connected
by aﬂinity or consanguinity to one of the parties, is nevertheless competent to

sit upon the determination of the competency of a brother Judge.
§ 8. That where the wife of a son of one of the Judges was aunt to the plsintiﬂ‘,
the Judge was not disqualiﬁed by reason of aﬂlnity, for the son only had formed

acts which might be done by the Judge of the court, were he presiding, the Judge
of another court, presiding in his stead,by interchange, may do in like manner.
Thus, a Judge presiding by interchange, may appoint a special term, the holding oi

question seems to have been made in either case upon the propriety of the pro

ceeding.

The opinion of the majority of the court delivered by Andrews, J., in

llclﬁnnville 8: Manchester R. R. Co. v. Huggins, 7 Cold. 217, is commended as
the leading case on the interpretation of the above section, and section 4518,

and its reasoning is said to be conclusive.

Msbry v. Ross, 1 Heisk. 769, 776.

The case in 7 Coldwell holds that, under the above section, the Supreme Court or
a part thereof, cannot set aside an order granting or dissolving an injunction, but
that the authority conferred by it is limited to the staying of proceedings which

qre of a nature to be actively and aﬂirmatincly enﬁrrced against a party. p.
Q28.

And this interpretation is adopted in the case in 1 Heiskell, where a super- _

sedeaa was refused to set aside a decree dissolving an injunction. pp. 769-776.
In arriving at this result it is incidentally held
I. That the proper oﬂlce and function of the superscdeas is undoubtedly merely
to stay proceedings. 7 Cold. 223; citing Bouv. Law Dict. That it is technically
a writ to suspend ‘the execution of a judgment; that there must be something in
the course of execution, to suspend which the writ is awarded; something inﬁcri,
but not yet ﬁnished ; some aﬂirmative act to be done, to prevent the doing of
which the writ is awarded. 1 Heisk. 778.
§ 2. That the supersedeas provided for in the above section, and Q 4518, does not
operate as an appeal or writ oi‘ error, to bring the cause into the Supreme Court.
The cause remains in the inferior court, and the superseded: when granted, merely

suspends the cause until ﬁnal hearing but does not reverse it.

§ 7 Cold, 224.

§ 8. That the only cases where the supcrsedeas is provided for in the Code, ex
cept in sections 8988 and 4513, are cases in which it is given as ancillary to the

writ of error and the writ of certs'ora1-i; and in which its oﬂice is merely to stay
proceedings under the judgment or decree, while the cause is pending in the ap_
pellate court. 7 Cold. 228.

§ 8934. The Clerk of the Supreme Court, upon issuing super-am ,0 ,,,,,,

deas in such case, shall transmit to the Chancery Court a copy iii’ 1 $0 $01111

§ 3935. The Chancellors of the State, or a majority of them,
may make such rules as they may deem beneﬁcial and proper

upon shall be obligatory on all the Chancery Courts.

might designate the business to be done at the special term, having reference to the business of the docket of the court.

Brown v. Newby, 6 Yerg. 895.

Where

a special term was appointed “ for the trial of causes upon the civil docket," this
order was held to exclude criminal causes, and included all civil business at law
u and in equity, and a decree in equity at such a special term, [the Circuit Courts at
that time having equity jurisdicti0n,] was valid, and conclusive upon the parties_
Ib. The laws authorizing special terms make them distinct terms, and not contin
uations of the regular terms ; and if an appeal be prayed for' and granted at a reg
ular term, the cause is immediately transferred to the court oi‘ errors and appeals;

and no order made at the regular term can be changed, or any new order made in the
cause at the special term. And an order made at the regular term that a party have
until the special term toprepare a bill of exceptions, is of no validity, and in such

a case, a bill of exceptions signed at the succeeding special term will not be noticed
in the Supreme Court. Staggs v. State, 8 Humph. 272, 2'14. See note to Q 2968
§ 80, where by law a motion was to be made at the ﬁrst term of the circuit court, after

cannot be made atsuch special term. Gamer v. Carroll, 7 Yerg. 365. And where a

judgment by default was taken,and an inquiry of damages awarded to be executed
at the next term, and a special term intervened before the next regular term, it
was held that the writ of inquiry was properly executed at the special term.

Hall

v. Mount, 3 Cold. 75. See I 8529 b. A continuance of a cause to the next term,
must be understood as subject to the power of the court to appoint a special term,
at which it will stand for trial. Ib. But where a special term intervenes after the
appearance term, or term at which the pleadings are made up, it is held that the
cause does not stand for trial until the next regular term, and a trial without con
sent at the special term is error, and ground of reversal ; the policy of the statute

being to relieve the crowded docket of" causes already upon them, and not to
bring causes to trial before the parties have had the time which the law allows,

after making up the issue, to prepare for trial.

prepared and sent to the Grand Jury bya person who signs himself John Wilker
son, acting as soliciter-general, will not be sustained. The designs of the consti
tution are disappointed by sulfering the interference of any other than the Attorney
General, and therefore it ought not to be allowed; not excluding those temporary

qﬂicers who are legally appointed by the Governor or court, when such temporary
appointments are provided for by law. 3 Hayw. 98. That the State can employ

must show the facts necessary to support the appointment, as that the regular
incumbent of the olﬁce is absent. Hite 1. State, 9 Yerg. 198, 202; Staggs v.

regular appointment. Such an objection is purely technical and does not reach

the merits.

The day has now passed for rescuing the guilty upon mere technicali

The Legislature has wisely willed it, and it is not for the courts to resist

the great reform.

We would rather favor than obstruct it.

§ 1 Sneed, 114-15.

A year later, the Supreme Court again reverse this rule and hold that in the ex

ercise of this power to appoint, it is material to state in the order the facts which
render it necessary, so that it may appear to be a case under the Constitution.

[Art 6, Q 6.]

For the court has no general power to appoint, but a special power merely; and in its exercise the facts must appear, on the existence of which the
validity of the appointment depends. Pippin v. State, 2 Sneed, 43, 45. The Con
stitution provides for but two cases in which this power of appointment can be
exercised: 1. Where the Attorney General fails to attend. 2. Where he reﬁna

ce to attend. Hence, an order appointing an Attorney General pro fem. in a pur
ticular case, on the ground that the regular incumbent was incompetent by ren
son of having defended the prisoner before his election and qualiﬁcation as At
torney General, discloses a -new cause of appointment not warranted by the Con
stitution, and is ground of arresting judgment. But if the regular incumbenthad
failed or reﬁned to attend and prosecute, as he might with good and sulﬁcient
reason have dons, the power to appoint would have been clear and explicit. 2
Sneed, 45-6. But where an Attorney General has been appointed by the Gover
nor, [under Q 819,] it is not necessary, noris it practicable that the commission
should be copied into the record of every court in the circuit, nor need the record
show his appointment; as the Supreme Court will take judicial notice of the
same. Nor is it necessary in signing an indictment that such an olﬁcer should
specify the district of which he is Attorney General.

tation.
The courts cannot impose other conditions upon admission to practice, nor pre
scribe a different oath from that imposed by the above section. Thus, where a
rule of court required attorneys, in addition to the oath prescribed by the statute,
to swear to support “ the Schedule adopted by the people on the 22nd of Febru
ary, 1865, and all laws enacted by the Legislature, under the constitutional amend
meats, until declared void by the Supreme Court of the State,” the rule was held
unauthorized ; and an order prohibiting an attorney from practicing without tak

inlg it was error. It was also held that such an order was one from which an ap
peal lies; and the Supreme Court ordered the attorney restored to practice.
Champion v. State, 3 Cold. 111. So an attorney was not an oﬂicer within the
meaning of the repealed Act of 1868, Ex. Sess., ch. 2, § 5, which prescribed what
was known as the “Kuklux oath,” and required it to be administered to “ all oili
cers.” Iugersoll v. Howard, 1 Heisk. 247, 254. [From the analogy of this case,
it would appear that the frequent practice of administering to attorneys the oath

against dueling, prescribed by Q} 752, 752:1, is without authority of law; and
some of the Circuit Judges have so held, when the taking of the dueling oath was

objected to.--Eds.]

from which an appeal lies to their court. Sheriffs and other

§ 3970. The several courts of this State may strike from their mm mgy
strike from

rolls any person not authorized to practice in such courts, andr@11I
also any practicing attorney or counsel, upon evidence satisfac

tory to the court that he has been guilty of such misdemeanor,
or acts of immorality, or impropriety, as are inconsistent with

the character or incompatible with the faithful discharge of the
duties of his profession.

[Act 1817,Cl1. 51,§1;1821,ch.66,§3.]
If an attorney has been convicted of crime, he is deemed unﬁt for the ofﬁce, and
is stricken from the roll, [Brownsha1l’s Case Cowp. 829,] and was commonly sworn
in former times, never again to practice in any oi‘ the Kings‘ courts. [2 Inst. 214;
§ 4 Inst. 101 ; 2 Inst. 212 ; Jerome's Case, Cro. Car. 74.] If an attorney has been
guilty of conduct corrupt in the estimation of the court, he will be stricken from
the roll as above, although it does not in law amount to an indictable olfence.

[King v. Southerton, 6 East, 142; 1 Com. Dig. 630 ; 2 Hawk. 219.]

These au

thorities fully establish the powers of the courts to inquire, upon evidence, in s

summary way into the conduct of its oﬂicers, and to remove them in certain cases,
if they are thought unﬁt for the station. But the duties of the attorney in England
diﬁ'er in many respects from those of our attorneys, who are counsellors also.
They are holden to be peculiarly oﬂicers of the court, and subject to its control.

Improftssional, indelicate and reprehensible, and for which it may have been the
duty of the court to have stricken the attorney from the rolls. Turner v. St. John,
§ 3 Cold. 876, 378. The causes for which an attorney may be debarred under‘ the

old statute of 4 Hen. 4, and our old statutes made in aﬂirmance of it, are discussed
in Smith v. State, 1 Yerg. 228 ct seq. It is said to be remarkable that there is not
a provision in any act of Assembly in Tennessee upon the subject, but what is in
strict aﬂirrnance of that statute ; nor does a single provision go beyond it. Our

statutes require that the attorney shall be of good moral character, learned, and
of capable mind. A loss of either cl‘ these is a good ground of withdrawing the priv
ilege conferred by the license. Ib., 230 ; decided in 1829. Suppose an attorney were
to become insane by the hand of Providence or by intemperance, he would be dis
qualiﬁed and the license should be withdrawn. Were he to become besotted and

notoriously protiigate, he would be neither virtuous nor of good fame, and should
bestricken from the roll. Ahundred other instances might be cited where attor
neys once qualiﬁed might become disqualiﬁed; when the privilege should be taken
from them. Ib. This instructive case contains much other dicta on the same sub
ject, and holds that it is a good cause to strike an attorney from the rolls that he

accepted a challenge to ﬁght a duel, or that he fought aduel ina sister State,
and killed his antagonist.

§ 3971. If charges are preferred against an attorney or c0un- mugelw be
sel to any court, they shall be reduced to writing and a copy fur- “‘_‘"“““'
nished the person accused, who may appear and show cause
against the charges. [Act 1815, ch. 97, § 2.]
In Smith v. State, 8 Yerg. 228, 231, the practice in the proceeding to debar an
attorney, both as it is in England, and with us, under the above Act of 1816, is
discussed. It is said that after the attorney has been cited to appear, the practice is the same with us as under the British statute.

The attorney may answer the

charges in writing, if he chooses, when evidence will be heard to support or resist

them ; or if he does not answer, still the charges must be proved or confessed by
the defendant before he can be stricken from the roll. If the charges are insuflicient
he may move to quash them, and there the matter will end. Pleas and demurrers
never entered the mind of the Legislature when prescribing the mode of procedure

under the Act of 1815. They only meant that a plain man, ignorant of law, should
have a plain remedy against a member of a profession possessing many advan

tages in skill over him; that his statement should be taken as prima facie
true. 1 Yerg. 281. The question of practice is further discussed wth similar con
clusions in the opinion of Judge Peck, p. 238 at seq.

§ 3973. No attorney or counsel shall be permitted, in giving
testimony against a client, or person who consulted him pro
fessionally, to disclose any communication made to him as attor
ney by such person, during the pendency of the suit, before
or afterwards, to his injury. [Act 1821, ch. 66, § 3.]
See 1 Greenl. Ev., § 237 ct seq.—The rule declared by the above section is found
ed in public policy. It is a rule of_ protection to the client, more than a rule of
privilege to the attorney. The latter is not allowed, if he would, to break the seal
of secrecy and conﬁdence. Itissupposed to be necessary to the administration of
iustice, and the prosecution and defense of rights, that the communications between
clients and their attorneys should be free and unembarrassed by any apprehensions
of disclosure or betrayal. The object of the rule is, that the professional inter

course between attorney and client should be protected by profound secrecy.

It

is not necessary to the application of the rule, as was held in some of the old cases,

now overruled, that a suit should be pending or anticipated, [1 Greenl. Ev., Q 240,
note,] nor that there should be a regular retainer or payment of fees.] 1 Greenl. Ev.,
§ 241.] But he must be applied to for advice and aid in his professional character,
and that in relation to some act past, or right or interest in e:cistancc. The rule

has no reference to cases where abstract legal opinions are sought on general ques
tions of law, either civil or criminal.
In such cases, no facts are or need to be
disclosed implicating the party, and so there is nothing to conceal of a conﬁden
tial nature. If the defendant had perpetrated an act, and applied for legal corin
sel and advice in relation to it, secrecy would be imposed; but where no act has
been done, or if done, not disclosed, and only n general opinion on a question

of law is asked, there would be no professional conﬁdence. It would be mon
strous to hold that if counsel was asked and obtained in reference to a con
templated crime, the lips of an attomey would be sealed, where the fact might
become important to the ends of justice in the prosecution of crime.

In such a

C1180 the relation cannot be taken to exist. Public policy would forbid it. We
presume the rule has never been extended so far, nor will it be. Mcliianus v.

Bennett v. State, Mart. & Yerg. 183.

But if a writ of

venirc faeias is actually issued, it need not set forth the order of the County Court
in pursuance of which it is issued. Such an order forms no part of the writ, and
is not required to be certiﬁed to the Circuit Court.

Besides the existence of such

an order is presumed, because it will not be intended that the clerk acted without
it. State v. Cole, 9 Humph. 626, 628. It is immaterial whether it begins “I com.
mand you to summon,” or “ you are hereby commanded to summon.” Ib. Nor
need the clerk in signing it add his official designation. His name is suﬂicient ;
for the court will judicially know who is clerk, without his certifying that he is

clerk by adding his oﬂicial designation. Ib.

Nor need the seal of the court be

aﬁlxed to the writ, nor to a copy of the order designating the jurors, if that is

issued instead of the writ. Mart. & Yerg. 184-5.
Form of the writ.—The following form taken from State v. Cole, 9 Humph.

But it seems that objections of this nature savor of reﬁnement and technicality,

positive rules laid down, that it is not the existence of an opinion either way,

q which constitutes the disqualiﬁcation, but the grounds on wlulclult is formed. 2
Swan, 583. Or it might be speaking more correctly to say, that the law does not
regard an opinion at all, unless based upon a knowledge, or reliable information

of thcfacts. 2 Swan, 588.
The rule is that an opinion disqualiﬁes a person as a juror—

§ 1. Where the opinion is founded upon a person's own knowledge of the facts,
or n statement of them by witnesses or others professing to know the circumstances.
§ 2 Swan, 581-2; Hoses v. State, 11 Humph. 232, 285; Moses v. State, 10 Humph.

§ 456, use; Rice v. State, 1 Yerg. 432.
§ 2. Where the opinion is entertained, but from the examination it is left doubt
ful whether it is formed as above stated, or not, 2 Swan, 581-2. But if the opin
ion is formed merely from rumor or report, and not relied on as true, it does not
disqualify him. 2 Swan, 583 ; 11 Humph. 235; 10 Humph. 458; Henry v. State,
§ 4 Humph. 270. The rule stated in an earlier case was, that if the person has
heard the circumstances of the case; and, believing the statement to be true, has
fonned, or formed and expressed an opiuion—that is, has made up his mind

as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, he ought to be rejected.

Mc

Gowan v. State, 9 Yerg. 184, 198. 'I_'his rule was carefully re-examined and
renﬂirmed in Payne v. State, 3 Humph. 875, where it is said to be clear, explicit,

and free from ambiguity—an accurate and just delineation of the grounds and
principles upon which the impartiality of a juror may be tested; and’ both these
cases are quoted and approved in Henry v. State, 4 Humph. 270; and the princi
ple of McGowan‘s case is also recognized in Wright v. State, 4 Humph. 194, and
Carroll v. State, 8 Humph. 815. Another case lays down the rule as follows :
That loose impressions, and conversations of a juror as to a prisoner’s guilt or in
nocence, founded upon rumor, if disclosed by himself or others to the court on
the selection of the jury, do not have the effect to set him aside as incompetent, nor
if disclosed after the verdict, are they a cause for new trial. Howcrton v. State,
Meigs, 262; quoted, criticised, and declared to be sound law, in Troxdale v. State,
§ 9 Humph. 411, 422; again quoted and declared to be well settled in Brakeﬁeld

v. State, 1 Sneed, 215, 219. The rule is carried, if possible, further, in Major v. State,
§ 4 Sneed, 597, 607, where nine jurors stated that they had formed an opinion as to
the guilt or innocence of the prisoner; that the opinion was formed from rumor ;
that they yet believe the rumor; and each one said he still had an opinion ; yet

it was said they were not disqualiﬁed. The court aid: “ It is now well settled
that an opinion formed upon mere rumor, though entertained atthe time the jur
or is presented, does not disqualify him.” 4 Sneed, 608. But it is said that the
above rule of Howerton v. State, though sound law, has gone as far as the law on

this point can be carried. Accordingly the court limit this rule by another,
which may be stated as follows : If the expression of opinion of the guilt or in
nocence of the prisoner is not a loose expression of opinion founded on rumor,
but a deliberate and calm expression of opinion, founded upon the best informa
tion llc could get, he would be disqualiﬁed; and if such disqualiﬁcation should ap

pear after Yﬁﬂiﬂi,» he would be held to have prejndged the case, and a new trial
should be granted.

Troxdo-lo v. State,9Humphi. 41 l,422—3.

And where a person

oﬁered as a juror appears to have formed on opinion, not from minor merely, but
upon a detail of circumstances from persons in whom he seems to have conﬁded,

he ought to bercjected for cause.

McGowan 1. State, 9 Yerg. 184, 193. If the

juror comes on the spot where the body ofthe deceased is lying, immediately after
the killing, nnd says the accused ought to be hung ; and when he is presented as
a juror, says that now he has no opinion, and fails to explain the changes wrought
in his mind, he is not a competcntjuror. Norﬂeet v. State, 4 Sneed, $40, 343.

he had formed nnd expressed an opinion ; and the court thereupon asked the coun
sel for the prisoner what step they proposed to take, and they ‘replied that they
had nothing to say, whereupon the court discharged thejuror as if challenged for

cause-—'tt was held to be error to discharge the juror without ascertaining up
on what his opinion was based; but the defendant not having objected at the time,

tacitly consented to the juror‘s discharge, and hence, could no take advantage of
the error after verdict.

Challenge arraujuror suom.—.\'othing has been better settled for centuries

No higher authority of what the criminal law and its practice is, cuu be referred
to than Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, who lays down the rule to be “ That no
juror can be challenged either by the king or by the prisoner, without consent, at‘
ter he has been sworn, unless it be for some cause that happened since he was
sworn. [2 Hawk. P. C. 43.] Nor is want of knowledge an exception to the general
rule. [King v. Watson, Yelv. 24 ; McClure v. State, I Yerg. 206, 219.] Gilles

Disqualiﬁcation ofjurors idmt ground of new trial, and when not.—Upnn the
same ground it has been repeatedly held, that objections to a juror, propfer defect
um, which were not made known upon challenge, cannot be urged as ground for a
new trial. Calhoun v. State, 1 Humph. 477, 478, 480. As that the juror was
not u freeholder of the county of the venue. l Humph. (V8, 480. But where the
attorney objected, after thejury had been sworn, that one oi‘ them was not a frec
holdcr, or householder, and moved that nuother juror be subI.ituted., to 'I‘1’IICl1 the

prisoner objected, it was held that the prisoner could not afterwards assign the
sitting of that juror as error. Jamigan v. State, 1 Yerg. 529. So, it cannot be ob
jected, after verdict. that a juror was an athei.<t. 1 Yerg. 218-19. Or that he

was n member of the grand jury which indicted tbcqrisoner. 8 Yerg. 508.

§ 4025. Ortliat one ofthe jurors had nmde a. w:r-_get~on the result of the verdict; it

i

But if it be made to appear by aﬁduvit that one of the jurors forrned a deliber
ate prejudgmeatt of the prisoners guilt, that is, had made a deliberate and calm

expression of opinion, based not upon rumor, but upon tie ﬁrst information he
could get--such a case presents the very question reserved in Howerton v. State,
lleigs, 262, viz., that oi‘ a juror denying upon oath his opinions and convictions
with the design ofiujuriug the prisoner by sitting upon his trial; and in such a state
of facts a new trial ought to be granted. Troxdale v. State, 9 Humph. 411, 433.
So where it was made to appmr by nﬂidavit that one oftiuejurors, on the day
of the trial, before being selected, had said, “ As to Hrakctﬁeld, 1 believe he ought
to be hung; damn him, he ought to be hung,”--he was held to have prcjudged the
ease, and these facts not being known tothe prisoner at the time he accepted the ju
ror, it was held that he was entitled to a new trial. Drakeﬁeld v.State, 1 Sneed, 215,
§ 218. It was with reference to a case of this kind, numel_v,tha1tofa juror being dis.
qualiﬁed by reason of having made up his mind as to the prisoner’s guilt, the prison

er heing unaoquainted with this fact, and who on his coir dire had testiﬁed that he
had not formed or expressed an opinion, that the Supreme Gout-t in Howerton v.
State, Meigs, 262, lay down the rule above stated, that loose impressions and conver
sations founded upon rumor will not disqualify.
Eject of ajidavit in such case.-—-The case of Howerton v. State, above quo
ted, is understood to hold that the aﬂidavit of one person made after conviction,
that a juror had before the trial expressed an opinion as to the prisoner's guilt,
would merely be a counterpoise to the juror's statement to the contrary on his
voir dire, and would not be suﬂicient evidence that the juror had prejudged the
case to entitle the prisoner to a new trial. Mcigs, 264 ; and this ruling is approv
ed in Troxdale v. State, 9 Humph. 411. But, this last case limits the rule, and
holds it not to apply where the pre-judgment ofthe case is established by two wit
nesses. 9 Humph. 423. So in Brakcﬁeld v. State, 1 Sneed, 215, 218, the fact that
thejuror had expressed a conviction of the prisoner's guilt, was established by two
witnesses, and the question of the above cases was not Faised. But the counter
aﬂidarit of the juror was offered to explain the matter, and this was held inadmis

sible, because the juror stood criminated before the court; and it is a settled rule,
that the aﬂidavit of the offending juror cannot he relied on to exculpate him-.
solf and prejudice the prisoner. 1 Sneed, 219; citing to this point Hines r. State,
§ 8 Humph. 602, and Luster v. State, ll Humph. 170.

Eject of discharging juror.-Where ajuror is thus dicharged before being
sworn, the prisoner is only allowed his peremptory challenges unexbausted. He
is not entitled to a new venire. Lewis v. State, 3 Head, 127, 143. The same rul
ing was in effect made in Fletcher v. State, 5 Ilumph. 249, 256.
It is otherwise if thejury has been sworn and the trial commenced. See Q4028,
and note. Where one,of the persons selected as a juror, before the panel is com

pleted,is permitted to stand aside on his own application, for physical inability’ to sit,
without objection from either party, but also without the consent of the prison.

er, this is no error, although both parties exhaust their whole number of peremp
tory challenges before the panel is completed. 5 Humph. 256.
The interrogatories which may be propounded on either side, will not be pre
scribed by the court of errors, but will be left to the discretion of the Circuit Court.
Fletcher v. State, 6 Humph. 249, 255, where the rule is aptly illustrated.

term within the twelve months next preceding.

[Act 18-13-4, ch. 134, § 3; 105, ch. 60, § 1.]
See also Q 39ts8.—'l‘he reason for disqualifying persons who have suits pending
was evidently to prevent any combination among the jurors to render verdicts in
favor of each other ; and this reason would be just as applicable to cases pend
ing but continued, as to cases pending which may he continued. With this in view
it is held that the above section and Q 3988 are to be construed together, and that

the expression in the above section “who has a suit then pending for trial at the
same term ofcourt” means and was intended to mean, precisely the same thing as
the expression in Q8988 “ who has an action pending in court at the term to which
he is nominated.” Therefore ajuror is incompetent who has a cause pending in the
court, although it is not for trial at the term to which he is nominated. Riley v_
Russel, 1 iieisk. 294, 298. [This ruling is based upon an inadvertent and erroneous
quotation ofboth the clauses construed, which we have corrected above, in ab
stracting the case. It is submitted with deference that on a correct reading of
the clause from Q 8988, neither of the sections will bear this construction. —~Eds.]

essary to returua bill, many form a majority oi‘ all. Pybos v. Sli|.t0, 3 llumph. 49,

citing authorities. The Act of 1779 prescribed that the ﬁrst eighteen drawn shall
be a Grand Jury. The Act of 1811, provided that “no more than thirteen shall be
drawn." It was held that these Acts were merely directory as to the maximum
number which should be sworn as the Grand Jury;that the practice has been

uniform that if one of the thirteen be sick or unable to attend, the remaining
twelve may trunsnct the business of the Grand Jury; and that under these Acts
the number of twelve will constitute a valid Grand Jury. 8 Humph. 49, 51. If
one of the Grand Jury be incompetent, their proceedings are void; because the
proper number to constitute the grand inquest is wanting, and because he who is
incompetent shall not be one oi‘ the triers of the offense at any stage of the prose

See Q 8993, and note.—Where only thirteen of the panel selected by the
County Court attend, they arew be organized into a Grand Jury and sworn, with
out the formality of drawing their names from a hat. So, if less than thirteen
attend, the form is dispensed with, and the jury is completed from the bystanders.
The requirement that the names of the Grand Jurors are to be drawn from a hat,
only applies where more than thirteen of the panel are in attendance. Work»
man v. State, 4 Sneed, 425. Under the above statute [Act, 1817, ch. 131,] it is

said that if the County Court nomination be illegal and void, it will be disregarded
by the court, and bystanders empanneled. And if the jurors thus \mh\u~fully nom
inated aud summoned are freeholders or householders, they are “good and law

ful men," [Q 8981,] and, standing by, may be empanneled.
§ 4 Yerg. 145, 147.

Lowrence v. State,

Suppose nsuliicieut number are not summoned by the sheritf; or, if summoned,
do not attend, the Act of 1817, orders the deﬁciency made up of bystanders. A
majority of this court do not believe that where less than twenty-six jurors are
nominated, [now twenty-ﬁve,
§ 3981, 8982,] the order of the County Court is
void. Every man in the county who isa freeholder or householder, being the
“ peer“ of every other man, is a qualiﬁed juror. The County Court has the right

to nominate as high as twenty-six,[uow thirty-seven, Q 8982,] for the Circuit Court
has the power to summon every man in the county to attend, if needed, and out

of twenty-six to draw a Grand Jury.
of facts are equal; and the Circuit Courts have full power and unlimited discrtr

tion, without making distinctions, to call forth and organize this arm of the ju
dicial power. Truly, for the sake of convenience, andvtluzt a jury may be ready
to aid the courts, the County Court is directed to see that the common sheriff of
both courts has a jury ready on the ﬁrst day of the term. But if the County
Court, the sheriff, or the jury summoned fail, the Circuit Court in virtue of its own
power, calls upon the jurors of the county at pleasure, and proceeds with busi
ness. Ib., 4 Yerg. 147-8. We deem it idle to reﬁne in reference to the details of

practice in the courts below.

Was the Grand Jury who found the bill of indict

ment composed of good and lawful men? Such is the presumption in favor of
the proceedings of the Circuit Court lb; citing MeClure‘s Case, 1 Yerg. 206. It is
not necessary that the qualiﬁcation of the Grand Jury should appear in the caption
of the indictment. Cornwell v. State, Mart. & Yerg. 147, 149-50; State v. Alder
son, 10 Yerg. 5234. The understanding of the rule was, that where the indict
ment is found in a superior court, the statement that the jurors were good and

lawful men is not even necessary.

Bonds v. State, Mart. 6:. Yerg. 148, 146; cit

ing Chit. Cr. L. 333; 2 Hawk. ch. 25, Q 126. And so, it is said that if the names
of the grand jurors do not appear in the record, and the proceedings have been
had in a superior court, regularity of proceeding is presumed as in the King’i
Bench. McClure v. State, 1 Yerg. 206, 218; citing 1 Sauud. 248, note 11. Nor
need the names of the grand jurors appear where the indictment has been found
in the Circuit Court, it‘ it appear to have been found by the competent number.
Ib. Nor is it necessary that there should be a separate caption to the proceed
ings reciting that the grand jurors were sworn. If the grand jurors themselves

recite that fact in the indictment, that is suﬂicient.

§ 1 Yerg. 216-‘Z18.

[As to the

requisites of the caption of the record under our practice, see Q 4041, note; Q

§ 5242, sub-secs. 4, 5.]

So, it is held not to be necessary that the venire facias

should be spread upon the minutes of the Circuit Court; for it composes no part
of the proceeding in that court. It is enough if the record shows the return of
the venire facias, and the selection of a Grand Jury of good and lawful men from
among the number summoned and attending. Conner v. State, 4 Yerg. 187, 140;
citing Cornwcll's case and McClure‘s case, above quoted. But if the record fail to
show that a venire facias was returned, and contain any other one of the grounds

of objection cured by Q 5242, the judgment must be reversed. State v. Davidson,
§ 2Cold. 184, 186 ; note (b) to Q 5242. But. the existence of an order of the County
Court authorizing the venire facias, need not appear in the record of the Circuit
Court. The existence of such an order is presumed; because it will not be in
tended that the clerk acted without such an order; and it need not and cannot

appear in the record of the Circuit Court; for it forms no part of the vcm'rafa
ciao, and is not required to be certiﬁed to the Circuit Court.

Humph. 626, 628.

State v. Cole, 9

But it seems from an earlier case that the practice is for the

clerk of the County Court to issue a certiﬁed copy of the order designating the
venire, which takes the place of a formal writ. See Q 3998, and note. But where
git was objected that the caption of the indictment did not show that the Grand

Jury were householders or frseholders, the objection was held to be answered
by the recital in the caption that they were good and lawful men ; for they could
not be good and lawful men without being householders or freeholders. Ib. For

the Supreme Court will presume in favor of the regularity of the Circuit Court.
If, however, the record does set out the venirc faciaa, and shows particularly and
minutely all that was done in selecting and empanneling the Grand Jury, and by
such record it appears that the statutes have not been pursued, a question wholly
diﬁerent would be raised. In such a case nothing would be left to presume. 4

Yerg. 141. But where the venire fat-ias as set out in the record, directed the sheriff to summon the following “good and lawful men", without other description,
and it was objected that itishould have commanded him in express words to sum
moncitizens of Maury county, it was held that the words “ good nnd lawful men ”
included every otherquuliﬁcation, and the writ was n suﬂicient command to sum
mon citizens of the county, householders or freeholders. State v. Alderson, 10
Yerg. 623; citing Comwell's case, above quoted, and 1 Chit. Cr. Law, 333.
“ F1-eeholder."——It is not necessary that the grand juror should be a freeholder

of the county, it being suﬂicient if he is a freeholder of the State. State v. Bry
ant, 10 Yerg. 627.
How objected to ; Plea in abatement.-~Ifthe record show that the Grand Jury
was composed of good and lawful men, we are bound to take the fact to be sot

unless the contrary is shown in the record which is alleged to be erroneous.

Law, 545; Mahala v. State, 10 Yerg. 537. The above Act of 1817, does not im
peratirely require that in case of the sickness of a juror another shall _be summon
ed,*and the cause immediately tried do M120. The act is only directory as to the
mode oi‘ proceeding where the case provided for shall occur. By the common law
where a juror becomes sick, the whole jury is brolien up, and the same eleven that
had before been sworn, are put to the prisoner, and may be eha1lengcd.by_ him.
[1 Chit. Cr. Law, 645; 4 Taunt. 309.] By the Act of 1817, ajuror is to be sum
moned instanter in place of the sick juror, and sworn, the eleven remaining as
part of the panel elected, and not subject again to challenge, nor are they again
to be sworn; [citing Garner v. State, 6 Yerg. 160, which declares this rule]

The right of challenge is conﬁned to the juror newly summoned alone.

State v.

Curtis, 5 Humph. 601, 603. We do not hold, as in England, that in consequence
of the withdrawn juror, the panel is broken up and that an entire selection dc
uovo must follow. [4 Taunt. 309 ; 2 Leach, 620; 3 Camp. 208.] The letter of
this act, which is directory, provides that jurors shall be called to ﬁll the vacated

places. The jurors remaining will be as so many selected and sworn; and be~
cause of those last called and sworn, the pleadings will be read again, and the tes"
iimony heard do yiovo. Garner v. State, 5 Yerg. 160, 164»-6,

But these principles

of the common law, and provisions of the statute, by which, in case of the sickness
of a juror, a trial may be had dc nova, in-siantcr, do not prevent the court from
postponing such new trial to another term. It may in its discretion, supply the

place of such sick juror, and proceed to try the cause do novo, or discharge the
jury and continue the ‘cause. 5 Humph. 608. Where a juror is discharged
for sickness, and the court proceeds to supply his place under the above statute,
the prisoner is entitled to his full number of peremptory challenges, as in case of
the discharge of the whole panel, and a venire do nouo. Garner v. State, 6 Yerg.

The clerk cannot, instead of inserting the documents which constitute a.

record, leave them out, and then supply the omission by his own statement of
their contents or substance. Simmons v. Wood, 6 Yerg. 618, 524; Barry v.
Rhea, 1 Tenn. 345. Thus, where a sci. ﬁx. was issued and served upon heirs, it
was held that the place of the writ and return as constituents of the record, can
not be supplied by the clcrk’s statement of the issuance and retum of the writ.

See note to Q 4077, sub-sec. 10. ‘The original papers in the inferior court can
not be used in the Supreme Court, instead of a transcript; nor will the Supreme
Court look to them as parts of the record, even by consent. Anderson v. Walk.

Note by M1-. Heiakall:

“But in practice it is often necessary to take up an

original paper, as where its genuineness is in question, and the extrinsic evidence
afforded by the paper is important; and in such cases the Supreme Court have,

ln several unreported cases, allowed the originals to be sent up with the record
by special order of the court below."

Walker v. Graham, 10 Yerg. 231, 232-3 ;

It is said to be a high exercise of judicial

power to make extraneous matter part of the record, and if not exercised with
great care, may be productive of much mischief. Wynne v. Edwards, '1 Humph.
§ 418. Such extraneous matter, including bonds, bills, notes, depositions, etc.,

must be examined and certiﬁed under the hand and seal of the judge by hill of
exceptions before they become part of the reoord., An order upon the minutes
that sych papers be made part of the record will not do; for this leaves it to the

clerk to certify and authenticate them—a duty which can only be performed by
the judge. But it seems the rule would be otherwise if such papers had them
selves been spread upon the minutes; for in such case, the judge, in signing the
minutes would necessarily authenticate them, and the clerk could not possibly
make a mistake in sending them up. 7 Humph. 418-20. So it is held in Allen
v. State, Hart. 8: Yerg. 294, which was a criminal case where the defendant had
been convicted, that a memorandum of a motion for the postponement of execu
tion, in order that the defendant might apply for pardon, made and overruled’

formed no part of the record, because not excepted to, and made part of the
record by bill of exceptions. [If this case means that an order of court, made in

the progress oi‘ a cause, and immediately atfecting the determination of the same,
or any of the parties thereto, and duly entered on the minutes, is not a part of the
record in the revising court, unless made so by bill of exceptions, it does not

seem to be supported by any other case. A later case says that “ nothing is part
of the record but the pleadings, the orders of court and the bill of exceptions"

Editors’ Note.—The following analysis of the transcript of n record in cases
at law may be found useful to clerks:—

§ 1. The carries. This isa historical statement by the court, preﬁxed to the
minutes of each term, showing
a. The style of the court from which the record is certiﬁed. Thus, if the
suit was commenced in another court, and came to this courtby change of venue,

the transcript should show simply the style of the court rendering the ﬁnal judg
ment. Or, if a suit had been commenced and ended, for instance, in the Law Court
of Memphis—a court which has been abolished by statute, and its records trans

ferred to the Second Circuit Court of Shelby County; Ind a transcript is desired
on which to sue in a foreign court, the caption would recite that the proceeding
took place in the Law Court of Memphis, and the certiﬁcate of the clerk certi

fying the record would show that he is the legal custodian of the same.
b. The name ofthc Judge who presided; in order that it may be seen that
there was a competent court to render the judgment.

c. The place where the court was held; in order that it may appear that it
was held at a place authorized by law. 'I'l1atis(1). The county seat ; or in case of a special court the town or city designated
by law for the holding of the same.
(2). The Court-house.
d. The term at which the judgment was rendered, that is, the date of the
commencement of the session; in order that it may appear that it was held at a
term authorized bylaw. If the judgment was rendered at a special term, the
caption should show that fact; otherwise it would show aiﬁrmatively that the

judgment was rendered at a term not authorized by law.
The following Fons or CAPTION is suggested:

Be it remembered that at a term [or special term] of the First Circuit Court of
Shelby County, State aforesaid, begun and held at the court-house in the city of
Memphis, in and for said county, on Monday the 21st day of January, the same
being the third Monday in January, A. D., 1871, present and presiding the Hon

orable Carrick W. Heiskell, Judge of said court, [or the Honorable A. B., Judge
of the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit presiding by interchange,] the following pro
ceedings were had, to wit: [Here follow with the body oi‘ the transcript]
§ 2. The ﬁrst step in the suit; that is, the sosn son cosrs, or attachment, re

plevin, or other bond given previously to the issuance of the original process ; or
the rsursa onn, if that has been taken in lieu of a bond.

§ 3. The osmnvu. raocsss; that is, the summons, attachment, writ of replcvin,
or otherwise.

If it were an attachment, and writs of garnishment were issued,

as these are merely notices to third persons by the levying oﬂiccr, they would not
be included in the transcript unless set out by the sheriff in his return, or made
part of the record by bill of exceptions. They are like subpoenas, and garnishees
are entitled to compensation as witnesses. See Q5 8087, 8102. If the original
process is returned not found, and alias and pluriea writs are issued, they
should also be set out in the transcript.
§ 4.

the declaration,
plea or demurrer, replication, etc.
§ 5. The

J
§ 6. The nun. Innis; namely

Thc order overruling motion for new trial, if any; entry of record showing the
signing of the bill of exceptions, if any is made; and entry of prayer and grant
of appeal. It may be here observed that the various processes, pleadings and
record entries are to be copied into the transcript in the order of their date, so
as to exhibit the various steps taken in the cause, in

historical order, and

thereby enabling the rivising court, without confusion, to comprehend the case.
This observation would not be thought necessary, but it would seem from Judge
Caruther’s instructions, Lawsuit, p. 267, that all the record entries are to be

grouped together in one place in the transcript. Thus, the date of process
should be exhibited by the clerk's endorsement of issuance, copied into the tran
script; of pleadings, by the clerk’s endorsement of the date of ﬁling; and entries
from the minutes, by a copy of the historical recital of the record, which is a re
cital by Uta court-for the record is signed by the Judge—which precedes the min
utes of each day, and whiclrgenerally runs thus:

“January Term, 1871, Monday, January 24th, 1871;" or, what is generally prac
ticed, a historical recital by the clerk, stating that at a. certain date the following,

entry appears of record, setting it out. See Car. Lawsuit,§ 404, sub-sec. 6.
§ 7. The am. or sxcsrrloas. This is to be copied literally, except where it in
structs the clerk in parenthesis, thus, (here insert it, etc.,) to insert depositions
or other documents on ﬁle.
Bills of exception are frequently drawn with little skill, and with little appar
ent knowledge of what proceedings in the case are parts of the record per se, and

what must be made so by being inserted in the bill. The bill often instructs the
clerk to set out therein pleadings, process and record entries which he has already
copied into the transcript in their historical order. In such case, the simplest
way would be to refer back to the page of the transcript on which such plead
ing, process or entry is set out; but as he has the plain command of the
judge before himto insert it in the bill of exceptions, he can only follow it,
and is probably entitled to his fees for the matter thus inserted a second time.

business of such clerk; such deputy ﬁrst taking an oath to
support the constitution and laws of this State, and faithfully
to discharge the duties of deputy clerk of the court for which
he acts. [Act 1794, ch. '1, §72, enlarged.]
As to the oath of deputy, see 1338; Coast. of Tenn., Art. 10, § 1; {Q 752,

§ 752 a.

Signature by, see note to Q 2815, p. 1183.

Neither the Code nor the

old Acts, 1794, ch. 1,@ 72, and 1805, ch. 1, prescribe the manner in which

deputies shall be appointed. In view of the old acts it was held that the appoint
ment might well be by parol ; for the public deals with the principal and holds
him responsible for the proper discharge of the duties of his ollice, and not the
deputy ; and that the acts of a deputy appointed by parol were valid, especially
ministerial acts, performed under the eye of the court while in session. Bonds v.
State, Mart. & Yerg. 143, 145. But in a later case, this case is said to establish
only that it is competent for a person not regularly appointed and qualiﬁed as
deputy clerk to perform under the eye and superintendence of the court, services

ofa ministerial nature.

Atkinson v. Micheaux, 1 Humph. 812, 319. And where

the clerk verbally requested an individual to attend to all the duties of his oiﬂce
during his absence, without appointing him deputy, and no oath was administered
to such person, it was held that he was a mere locum tenens by courtesy, and had
no power to administer an oath, or issue a ca. rat. 1 Humph. 312, 320. But in
Farmers’ and Merchants‘ Bank v. Chester, 6 Humph. 458, 478, it was held in
view oi‘ the act of 1794, ch. 1, Q72, that a deputy holding by valid appointment

was an oﬂcer do facto, and that his acts were valid as to third parties, although
he had not qualiﬁed according to law; and in view of earlier registration acts in

force at that time, it was held that the probate oi‘ a deed taken by such a deputy
was valid.

See Q 2039, and note; @2071, and note.

And the case above quoted

from 1 Humphrey: is said to be not in conﬂict with this view; for there the per
son whose acts were milled in question, was not a deputy at all, neither legally
appointed nor legally qualiﬁed. 6 Humph. 481. But an agent, in charge of the
oiﬁce during the absence of the clerk, may receive and place on ﬁle a bill in
chancery; and such I. bill will be regarded as ﬁled, and the suit commenced, so
as to save the bar of the statute of limitations, from the date of its being received

and placed on ﬁle by the locum tenens, and not from the date of its being marked
ﬁled by the clerk. Montgomery v. Buck, 6 Yerg. 416.
Note.—'l‘he proper and preferable way seems to be for the clerk to appoint his
deputy by an instrument in writing signed by him. Neither the seal of the court
nor the private seal of the clerk need be aﬂixed. The oath of the deputy should
then be written out, taken and subscribed to by him. @758. The oath may be
administered by the principal clerk, or any other oﬁieer authorized to administer

an ontli. Q 753, sub-sec. 1.
The oath includes
l. An oath to support the Constitution of this State, and of the United States,

and the laws of this State. Const. of Tenn. Art. 10, §4; @758, and the above
sub-section.
§ 2. An oath of ofﬁce. Const. of Tenn. Art. 10, § 1.

That is, an oath " faithl‘ull_v

oath “ faithfully to discharge the duties of his oﬂicc to the best of his skill and

§ 3. The oath against dueling, as prescribed in Q 7-'52 a.
The following form is suggested:
STATE or Term:-zssrr,

I, A. B., do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitu
tion of the United States, and the Constitution and laws of the State of Tennes
see; and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the oﬁice of Deputy Clerk
of the First Circuit Court of Shelby County, which I am about to assume, to the

best of my skill and ability.

And 1 do further swear that I have not, since I

became a citizen of this State, given, accepted, or knowingly carried a challenge,
in writing or otherwise, to any person being a citizen of this State, or aidcd or
abetted therein, since the adoption of the Constitution in 1835, and that I will

not during my continuance in oﬂlce be guilty of either of these acts.

§ 18 .
F. T. Clerk, etc.
This oath is to be “accompanied by the same certiﬁcate, ﬁled in the same
oﬂice, and with the same endorsement as the oaths oi‘ the principal,“ @758.

Which probably implies that the deputy's oath is to be ﬁled in the clerk's office,
and, together with his appointment, entered upon the minutes of the court-the
usual practice in such cases. It is a misdemeanor for the deputy to act without

ﬁrst taking and ﬁling the oath. Q 759.—Eds.
Receive
money.

§ 5. To receive the amount of any judgment or decree ren~
dered in the court of which they are clerks, either before or
after the issue of execution thereon. [Act 1807, ch. 66, §8.]
See Q 4093, sub—sec. 9.—The payment of nothing but money can be allowed
under this statute. And a receipt given by the clerk, the consideration of which
is anything but money, such as debts due by himself, choses in action, or property,
is not a satisfaction of the execution, but a hindrance to its collection. Crutch
ﬁeld v. Robins, 5 Humph. 15, 17; citing Lytle v. Etherly, 10 Yerg. 389, which
holds that the payment to the clerk of a bank check, endorsed “good” by the cash

ier of the bank upon which it was drawn, would not constitute a valid redemption of
real estate. There was some conﬂict of authority among the old cases as to
what was receivable as money. See note to § 1942; note to Q 1967. The better

opinion, and in accord with the current of modern decisions, seems to be that of
Crutchﬁcld v. Robins, 5 Humph. 15, followed in Graham v. State, 5 Humph. 40,
that money is a generic term and covers everything which by common consent is
used as a representation of property, whether it be gold or paper, and hence that

a payment in current convertible bank paper is a satisfaction of n judgment.

to a married woman sold by order of any of the courts of this
State, shall not be paid out by the clerk or any commissioner,

§ 4055. So, also, if the person entitled to the proceeds of ornerwn or
either realty or personalty, sold by order of court, is of unsound Wound mm’
mind, the funds can only be paid to a guardian or committee
duly appointed, who has given bond and security, according
to law, satisfactory to the court making the sale.
§ 4050. Any court in this State may, in term time, and as om, and
often as the public interest requires, direct the Attorney Gen-B§§§ii§?d'.b°

in which the clerk discharges his oﬂicial duties in relation

during the vacation after such court, carefully examine the
oﬁice, books, records, and papers of such clerk, and report in
writing their condition and the manner in which the clerk dis
charges his oﬁicial duties in relation thereto, specifying partic

or misbehavior in oﬁice; and for any other cause to which the
penalty of removal from oiﬁce is attached by law.
[Act 1801, ch. 17, and sundry .Acts.]
Acts of the Legislature declaring what act or omission shall amount to s for
feiture oi his oﬁice are not unconstitutional. Evans v. Justices, 3 Hayw. 26; &vier
v. Justices, Peck, 384. If the malfeasance or nonfcasancc appear to the court
from its records, it may remove the clerk without the intervention of s jury or con

viction on indictment. 8 Hayw. 27; Hardin County Court v. Ilurdin, Peck, 291 ;
Peck, 339. Nor is this a violation of the constitutional provision ,[Art. 1, Q 8,] that
no man shall be disseized of his freehold, but by the judgment of his peers, and
the law of the land. Peck, 339; 3 Hsyw-. 27. For the words “judgment of his

peers or the law of the land,“ mean the verdict of a jury in case of disputed facts,
or where the facts are otherwise legally apparent, by the judgment of a court
legally constituted. Peck, 339. And see Fields v. State, Mart. 8'. Yerg. 168 ; Tip
ton v. Han-is, Peck, 414; Q 4063. Nor would it be illegal or unconstitutional to
say that aclerk may be proceeded against both civilly and criminally, diverse

intuitu',- civilly, for the purpose of removal ; and criminally for the purpose of
pronouncing a judgment of disqualiﬁcation, after conviction on indictment. Peck,
§ 341. If an order of removal be made at an early day of the term, it is super
ceded by an order to reinstate the clerk made it a subsequent‘ day of the same
term, whether such order of restitution were erroneous or otherwise; and the
court cannot, at a subsequent term, snnul the order of restitution, but may
then make a new order of removal for the previous default. Peck, 291. Where
a clerk has been removed improperly, mandanius lies to compel his restitution.

Peck, 291; Ragsdale v. State, 2 Swan, 416; recognized in Felts v. Mayor 8: Al
dermen of Memphis, 2 Head, 650, 655. But a writ of error also lies to revise
the proceedings.

Form of the entry/.—The following form was held good in Calhoun v. State,

“Tuesday, February 8th, 1842.

of their otiicer, and returneda bill of indictment against John H. Calhoun, Nathan

[Here setting out the bill of indictment with the endorsement thereon.] A true
bill.
'
Absolom Grant, Foreman of the Grand Jury.”
[It is to be observed that it seems not to be the more usual practice to insert in
the body of each record entry the date at which the proceeding it recites took
place. This is shown in each case by the caption of the minutes of the day the entry
is made; except where orders omitted to be entered at the proper time are entered
mmc pro tune as of the date when they were made, in which case the date as of
which it is entered, is recited in the entry itself. In making transcripts where the
entries themselves do not show the date at which they were made, the clerk recites
historically from the minute book the date at which each entry appears of record;
and
no question
seems ever]to haveA been made as to the propriety of this practice.

The objection for incompetency of the justice must be taken before the justice,
and before trial on the merits, or it will be considered as waived. Wroe v. Greer,
§ 8Swan, 172-3. Foraparty may waive and preclude himself‘ from taking any
objection to o. decision on account of a judge being related to one of the parties,

and the waiver may be express, or by necessary implication. Ib. ; citing 3 Bl. Com.

§ 299, and notes; Matthew v. Ollertin, Mod. 226. But although the objection be made

before the justice and overruled, and the cause heard and judgment rendered
notwithstanding the objection, yet, the cause being appealed to the Circuit Court,
the incompetency of the justice cannot be objected to there by ples. in abatement,
because the appeal brings up the cause for trial dc novo, beforea competent court.

§ 4102. In all suits, instituted according to law, to sell the
real estate of deseedents for the payment of debts, or to sell
lands for partition, the court may decree a sale of lands lying
in any part of the State. [Act 1848, ch. 170.]

§ 4103. The courts of this State having jurisdiction to sell -1-R1,, ho,

Order and departments of a court in ses:ion.—The order of a court of jus
tice is s part of the law of the land.

The different departments of the court are

the bench and the bar, the clerk's box, within the bar, behind the bar, and the
area of the court. The bench, bar, and clerk’s boa: are intended for the officers
of the court; and are particularly under the government of the court.

speaking, no person has a right to go into the bar but attorneys.

Strictly

The people have

a right to be anywhere in the court-house except on the bench, in the bar, or in
the clerk’s box, so long as they demean themselves peaceably—but not to saunter
and stand between the bench and bar. The ordinary clients of lawyers sit by the

side of their counsel, by the general acquiescence of the bar; and if not in the
way, nor in any manner disturbing the business of the court, such client would
not be removed out of the bar to gratify the querulous disposition of any mem

ber of it. In criminal cases, the prisoner is either on trial or in custody. If the
former, his proper place is just within the bar near his counsel. If in custody,
the otﬁcers of the court, place him behind the bar, within sight of the court,
where he is attended to by the court and its oﬂicers. State v. Underwood 2 Tenn

§ 4106. The power of the several courts of this State to issue
attachments, and inﬂict punishments for contempts of court,
shall not be construed to extend to any except the following
cases: [Act 1831, ch. 19, §1.]
§ 1. The willful misbehavior of any person in the presence of

of justice. [Ib.]
§ 2. The willful misbehavior of any of the oﬁicers of said
courts, in their oﬂicial transactions.

As to enforcement of process and execution by attachment for contempt, see
{Q 3104, 3105. In chaucery, Q 4478 ct aeq.; Q 4860 at aeq.,' Underwood's case,

§ 2 Humph. 46. The Act of 1831, drawn into the above section and enlarged, is
similar in its terms to the Act of Congress of March 2, 1881, which was intr0~
duced and passed at the conclusion of the impeachment trial of Judge Peck,
before the Senate of the United States, which grew out of a proceeding for con
tempt. This Act, with several cases expounding it, will be found in Brightly's

Digest of Laws, Vol. 1, pp. 189-90. Sec also 4U. S. Statutes at Large, 487.

We

have but one case expounding the above section of the Code, namely, State v.
Gallaway, 6 Cold. 326. Although this opinion is extra-judicial, the court holding,
(page 331,) that they were without jurisdiction as a revising court, yet it was
perhaps called for by the circumstances of that case, and seems to be acquiesced
in by the bench and bar of Tennessee, as a correct exposition of the above stat
utc. It holds
§ 1. Tliat the inferior courts of Tennessee have no power to punish as contempts,
the acts or omissions of parties and persons, other than such acts and omissions
as are prescribed by the Code, or other statutory enactments. 5 Cold. 829.
§ 2. That contempts atcommon law, which do not fall within the ﬁve clauses pre
scribed by the Code, or other statutory enactments, are not punishable by the
inferior Courts of Tennessee; and that sub-section 6 was not intended to embrace,
and does not embrace, the vast and undeﬁned scope of contempts prescribed by
common law, outside of statutory enactments. The court say that such has been
the obvious and necessary construction of the Code, and such has been the uni
versul opinion and practice of the courts and profession in Tennessee, since tho

Act of 1831, ch. 19, which is substantially carried into the Code. 5 Cold. 329.
§ 8. That the above section withdraws from the courts the commonlaw power to
protect their suitors, witnesses, oﬂicers and themselves against the libels of the
press, though published and circulated pending the trial of the cause; unless,
perhaps, the matter published be of a character and vicinity to the court, so as
fairly to bring it within the class above prescribed, of " willful misbehavior of a
person so near to a court as to obstruct the administration ofjustice. 5 Cold. 830;
citing and qualifying Poulson's case, quoted iu 1 Kent Com., 801.
§ 4. That although the courts have no power to prevent the publication of their
proceedings while in progress by process of contempt, yet they may do so by
excluding from the court parties who are there for the purpose of reporting the
testimony or proceedings, except upon condition of suspending publication until
after the trial be completed, or until such time before the completion as the

court may judge proper.

§ 5 Cold. 839; citing 1-Iolmes’ case, 1 Wallace Jr.,

§ 1-11.

'5. The judgment of a court punishing a person for contempt, is not subject
to revision by appeal, writ of error, certiorari, or otherwise, although such judg

ment may be void on its fucs.

§ 6 Cold. 831-883.

The same ruling was made

in Martins‘ case, 5 Yerg. 456.
§ 6. The remedy where a party is illegally imprisoned for acontempt is by
Imbsaa corpus, by virtue of which writ the party imprisoned may, and ought to
he, discharged and released, if the imprisonment be illegal. 5 Cold. 335-337.
a. But this power of one court to release a person illegally imprisoned for
contempt by another court, is conﬁned to cases where the illegality or want of

jurisdiction appears ﬁmn the record of the committinq court. But it is not
competent for the court hearing the habeas cmyms to inspect and revise the
e-nidcwwe upon which the committing court acted. 5 Cold. 887.
§ 7. An appeal or writ of error does not lie to the Supreme Court, from the judg
ment of an inferior court or Judge, discharging, or refusing to discharge upon
Iiabw; corpus, u party from imprisonment for contempt. 5 Cold. 883-385; ac
cording with, but qualifying Malone's case, 3 Sneed, 418.
§ 8. In order that the remedy by habeas corpus may be effective, and consistent
with the power of the courts to maintain their dignity, safety, eﬂiciency, and cxis
ence, it shall be essential to the validity of a judgment committing a person for

<-nntempt, that it state on its fuce the cause of contempt alleged, as the ground
of jurisdiction on which the judgment is rendered. 5 Cold. 837-8 ; overruling
Snmmer’s case, 5 Ired.
§ 9. The power to punish for contempt being vital to the respectability, safety
and existence of the judicial department of the government, the above sub-sec
lious are not to be construed strictly, but so as to give them s liberal applica
lion to the cases which may arise in the exigencies of the courts. 5 Cold. 388-9.
§ 10. That the imprisonment of a person for publishing :1 newspaper article de
nouncing the Judge oi‘ a court as guilty of oﬂiciai corruption in discharging upon
bail a prisoner under indictment for o. felony, is unauthorized by the law of this
F-rate. 5 Cold. 828.

§ 4107. The punishment for contempts may be by ﬁne or Punishment,

imprisonment, or both ; but where not otherwise specially pro
vided, the Circuit, Chancery, and Supreme Courts are limited
in a ﬁne of ﬁfty dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding ten

(lays, and all other courts are limited to a ﬁne of ten dollars.
§ 4108. But if the contempt "consists in an omission to per Imprisonment.
form an act which it is yet in the power of the person to per

form, he may be imprisoned until he performs it.
§ 4109. If it consist in the performance of a forbidden act,

the person may be imprisoned until the act is rectiﬁed by plac
ing matters and person in statu quo, or by the payment of
damages.
§ 4ll0. Upon an attachment to answer for a contempt, ex
cept in not performing a decree, the ofﬁcer executing the pro
cess shall take bail from the defendant as in other cases; and
the court ordering the attachment shall specify the penalty of
such appearance bond. [Act 1831, ch. 19, § 2.]
T714 mode ofprocedure where the contempt is for breach of an injunction is
set out at length in Rutherford v. Metcalf, 6 Hsyw. 58. At common law a party
arrested for a contempt will be discharged, if by his answer to interrogations

ﬁled, he make such a statement as will free him from the imputed contempt;
and testimony contradicting the answer will not be heard. But in chmwery the
rule is dilferent. The answer of the defendant denying the contempt is not conclu
sive, and does not necessarily entitle the defendant to his discharge; but the

truth of the answer may be examined into ; opposing testimony may be heard, and
the action of the court regulated in accordance therewith. Underwood's case, 2.

the presence of the court, see New Chancery Rule, No. '1, Appendix.

§ 4113. The jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, when not
otherwise provided, is geographically co-extensive with the
limits of their respective counties.

[Const. of Tenn. Art. 6, § 15.]
And they have no oﬁlcial power or authority beyond the limits of their county.
The oiiice of a Justice of the Peace, by our constitution, is local, conﬁned within
the bounds of his county, beyond which he is divested of all oﬁicial power and

authority.

Bashaw v. State, 1 Yerg. 177, 187.

The exercise of the oﬂice and

duties of a Justice of the Peace is local in its nature, circumscribed by the lines

of the county, and conﬁned to its limits. When he passes those bounds, he leaves
his oﬂicial capacity behind him, and only reassumes it again upon his regress into
the county. Stewart v. Roberts, ,1 Yerg. 387-8. Thus, a marriage performed
by a justice outside his county was not a valid marriage under the marriage act
of 1797, so as to form a constituent part in a prosecution for bigamy. 1 Yerg.

§ 187.

So it was held that he could not issue an attachment against the prop

erty within his county, of a citizen of another county. 1 Yerg. 387. But the law
on this subject has been changed. See Q} 4178, 8456. In the former case, Peck
J., dissented, and thought there were many acts which a justice could do with
out regnrd toplace, such as signing judgment, taking bonds for appeal, and the

like.

But the constitution of 1834, followed by that of 1870, settled the rule

in accordance with the opinion of the other Judges, and since, the controversy

seems to have been, (arising on questions relating to the stay of executions,)
whether a.justice's judicial acts are valid if not performed and at his oﬂice ; and
the latest ruling, and the one more in accordance with the liberal iulendment
made in favor ofjustice’s proceedings, is that the acts of ajustice arc valid if per

formed anywherc in, his county, and that the place wherever he performs an
act, being in his county, is his oﬂice for that particular purpose and occasion.

[Act 1845-6,ch. so; 1853-4,<=11.ss,§ 1; 1849-50, ch. 269,
§ 1-]
This statute, giving justices jurisdiction to the same extent where the contract
is dischargeable in speciﬁc articles, as where it is dischargeable in money, renders
the rulings in Arnold v. Embree, Peck, 184, and Bedford v. Hickman, 1 Yerg.
§ 166, obsolete.

“Note of Iuzncl."-’1‘he old Act of 1809, 2d. Sess., ch. 64, § 1, read “ specialty,
note or agreement, signed by the parties, or on a settled account signed by the

parties; " and in such cases gave justices jurisdiction to the extent oi‘ one hun
dred dollars. In other cases their jurisdiction was limited to ﬁftyn dollars. It
was held that this did not embrace the claims of a surety against his principal,

, on account of the paying of his principal’s debt. Such a payment raises an im
plied G-Bsurnp-Ii! merely, but is not “ an agreement" signed by the parties. Gra
ham v. Green, 4 Hayw. 187.

[Applying this case by analogy to the present law,

it would follow that ajustice’s jurisdiction in such a case would extend to two
hundred and ﬁfty dollars only, under the following sub~ssction.—Eds.]
Awm-d.—So, under the same act an award was held not a specialty, nor an
agreement signed by the parties to be charged, nor n stated account signed ; for
though signed by the arbitrators, yet they are not agents of the parties. Collins v

Oliver, 4 Humph. 439. [Applying this case to the present statute, the extent of
a justice's jurisdiction in a suit on an award would be two hundred and ﬁfty dol
lars, under the following sub-section.-—Eds.]
Covenant in morl_qage.—So under the same statute, when a mortgage deed
recited that the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant in the sum of eighty-nine
dollars and twenty-two cents, it was held that this was a covenant for the pay
ment of money, and might be sued on before a justice, being within his jurisdic

tion.

Conger v. Lancaster, 6 Yerg. 477.

[Such a covenant not being a “note

of hand,” would probably now full under the next sub-section, and the jurisdiction

would be limited to two hundred and ﬁfty dollars.
cited below.—Eds.]

See White v. Buchanan;

“En(lor.1emenls."-The terms of the above sub-section in regard to the
jurisdiction on negotiable paper, repeal the rulings made in Smith v. Wallace, 4
Yerg. 572, and particularly the rulings in Mitchell v. Miller, Meigs, 510, and

Crockett v. Wright, 2 Humph. 322, on statutes then in force. See Meigs' Digest»
§ 1187; King's Digest, Q 7692 at seq. Since the passage of the acts extending
the jurisdiction on endorsements of negotiable paper to ﬁve hundred dollars
where demand and notice are expressly waived in the endorsement, it has been
held
§ 1. That the terms, obligation, contract, or other evidences of debt, [see neat
sub‘section,] do not embrace endorsements where demand and notice are not
waived.

Mason v. Westmoreland, 1 Head, 655-6; citing/Mitchell v. Miller, and

Crockett v. Wright, above quoted.
§ 2. That in case of endorsements, which do not waive demand and notice, the
jurisdiction of a justice does not, hence, exceed ﬁfty dollars. 1 Head, 556. [But it

would now be two hundred and fifty under the next sub-sect1on.—Eds.]
§ 3. That in such a case, where the proceedings do not show in what character
the liability of the endorser arose, either in the warrant or the judgment, the revis

ing court will not in a collateral proceeding, as by certiomri in lieu of audits
querela, sued out to quash execution, look to the note or other evidence, but will
presume that the justice has no jurisdiction. But if the case were to come up for
review upon appeal, or certiorari in lieu of appeal, the rule would be different
l Head, 557. The same ruling was made in Witt v. Bussey, 10 Hnmph. 208.

See note (ti), p. 1139.
Gua-mnty.—'l'he above section does not embrace a guaranty for the payment

of the debt of another. And where a justice rendered a judgment for three hun
dred snd forty ﬁve dollars and thirty cents upon an assignment of judgment and
guaranty of payment, it was held void for wsnt of jurisdiction. White v. Buchanan,

§ 6 Cold. 82, 84.

§ 2. To all unsettled accounts, obligations, contracts, or other A.c,,.,,,,,_
evidences of debt, not embraced in the preceding section, when GEO“ $250.

the amount claimed does not exceed two hundred and ﬁfty
dollars. . [Act 1853-4, ch. 58, § 2.]
This sub-section is noticed in Ayres v. Moulton, 5 Cold. 154, where the war

~ rantsnmmoned the defendants to answer the plaintiﬁs “ for money had and received
for their use and beneﬁt, to wit, two hundred and twenty-two dollars and ninety

cents, with interest thereon”; and it was held that the justice hsd jurisdiction
of that amount.
“Amount claimed. "—Under the old Act of 1794, ch. 1, { 52, it was held that

it was the balance due upon n. note, contract or other evidence of debt that
determined the question of jurisdiction. Thompson v. Gibson, 2 Tenn. 285 ;
Boyd v. Hensley, 5 Hayw. 258. Thus, where the debt or demand is reduced by
payment made on that particular account below the sum of ﬁfty dollars, the
minimumjurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the suit ought to be brought before a
justice. Ross v. Jackson, Cooke, 486. But the rule is otherwise if the plaintitf’s
demand is reduced by independent demands of the defendant which may be pleaded

by way of setroﬂ‘. Thus, where the plaintitf sued for four hundred dollars, and the
defendant established a set-oil‘ of three hundred and ninety-six dollars and ﬁfty
cents, it was competent for the Circuit Court to render s judgment for the balance,
namely, three dollars and ﬁfty cents. Cooke, 406. And see note to Q 4280. But
where the amount of the demand is within the justice's jurisdiction, but by
adding the accumulated interest thereto, it exceeds it, the justice cannot render a

judgment for the demand and interest, making a round sum in excess of his
jurisdiction, and such a judgment is void. Morrow v. Calloway, Mart. it Yerg. 240.
But where the debt as evidenced by a. written instrument is within the justice's
jurisdiction, but with the accumulated interest would exceed it, this does not
prevent the plaintiff from suing before a justice, if he does not claim in his
warrant a sum in excess of tltejur-isdiciitm ,- for by suing in his warrant for a
sum equal to the jurisdiction, though less than what appears to be due by his
note counting the interest, he admits that there is no more due than he sues for,
and abandons the excess; and a judgment for the amount sued for, will be a bar
to the further recovery of the excess. 5 Hayw. 258. So, where the value of the
property sued for in replevin is in excess of the justice's jurisdiction, the plaintiff

may, by ﬁxing a valuation in the warrant [aﬂidavit] at less than the real value,
bring the case within the justice's jurisdiction; and by such a. valuation, thus
voluntarily made, the plaintiff would be bound. If the property be not restored
to his possession by the writ, he cannot recover on trial a greater amount than
the valuation so ﬁxed by him; nor could he in any subsequent suit, recover the

difference between the amount and the real value of the property: the judgment
would conclude him. Gray v. Jones, 1 Head, 542, 645. See Q 3395, and note;

Q 3397, and note.

But a Justice of the Peace has not jurisdiction of a covenant

with collateral nomiitions, the performance of which is secured by a penalty
exceeding the amount of which he has jurisdiction, though the damages occasioned
by the breach be less than the penalty, and within the jurisdiction. Wallen v.

Lane, 1 Tenn. 74; Collins v. Oliver, 4 Humph. 439.

As a bond for the payment

of rent, the penalty of which was above the justice’s jurisdiction. I Tenn. 74.

Or a bond to perform an award. 4 Humph. 439. [Tho distinction between the
rule of these two last cases and that of those preceding, seems to be, that actions
on bonds with conditions “sound in damages ”—-4 Humph. 441-0. distinction
_which would now, perhaps, be regarded a technical when applied to justice's
proceedings; but whether this be so or not, has ceased to be of any importance,
since the extent of the jurisdiction is the same whether the action be to recover
on a simple contract or for damages,—-namely, two hundred and ﬁfty dollars.

Q 4128 a.-—Eds.]
As the justice cannot render a judgment for an amount beyond his jurisdiction,
so the Circuit Court cannot confer that power indirectly by entering a renziuilur.
Crow v. Cunningham, 5 Cold. 255, 260; Dixon v. Caruthers, 9 Yerg. 30, 32. If
the judgment be rendered by ajustice for a sum above his jurisdiction, and the
case be taken to the Circuit Court, that court cannot get jurisdiction by a remittilur
there, of an amount suﬁicient to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the
justice. 9 Yerg. 32. Nor in such case does appearance in the Circuit Court give
jurisdiction. White v. Buchanan, 6 Cold. 32, 33 ; citing 9 Yerg. 80, and Agee v.
Demcnt, 1 Humph. 332. But the same strictnesa not being required in proceed
ings before justices as in actions in the superior courts, there will be no reversal

in the Supreme Court because of the recovery in the Circuit Court being greater
than the damages laid in the warrant, if the amount of the recovery in the Circuit
Court is within the justice’s jurisdiction. In such ll case the warrant would he
amended in the Circuit Court, so as to embrace the whole extent of the justioe's
jurisdiction in damages. Hickerson v. Joyce, MS., Brownsville, 1869. But where
a note had been executed for an amount above a justice’s jurisdiction, and a party
who was surety thereon, executed his own note to the payee for an amount
sufficient to bring the original note within the jurisdiction of a justice, and the
maker was sued before a justice, and judgment rendered against him ; and alter
Wards, the surety having paid his note so executed to the original payee, sued
his principal for the same, it was held that a surety may make a payment which
will bringa note within the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace, without doing any
illegal act, or injuring any one in the estimation of the law. Such a payment is
not forbidden, either by common or statute law. Hall v. Hall, 10 Humph. 352.

title and then received the purchase money, and sued the vendee before a justice
for the inter-at which had accrued between the ﬁrst -tender and the actual pay

case, in reference to a judgment condemning land for taxes, where the items

were set out in columns like a justice’s docket, that the omision of the usual sign
of federal money [ Q ] before the items of judgment, rendered the judgment void
foruncertainty. Randolph v. Metcalf, 6 Cold. 400. A ruling so stringent would not
be extendedto justices’ proceedings, yet as papers are liable to loss, and ﬁgures to

Hollius v. Johnson, 8 Head, 846, 348.

An entry on

titled, “ Same v. Elias Reese,” held that the judgment against Elias Reese was void.
McClellan v. Cornwell, 2 Cold. 298. It is suggested in one case that the provision
of the Act of 1835, requiring justices to keep dockets will go far to cure defects

n form ofjustice‘: docket, which will be found in Caruthers Bl Nicholson’s Laws,
p. 485. This form does not precisely answer the requirements of the above sub
sections. For instance, the names of the parties are not set out in full, but are

set down as “ Jno. Doe vs. R. Roe." Under the rulings in Bell v. Williams, 4
Sneed, l96, and Johnson v. Billingsly, 8 Humph. 168, probably the old form
would still be good, but the following is supposed to meet more nearly the require
ments of the Code.

[For Form see next page]

will be sufficient to render the proceedings and entries valid
for all purposes, so far as the parties litigant are concerned, and

all persons claiming under them.

[Act 1851-2,-ch. 100.]

Thus, where the docket was ruled in columns similar to the form of the statute,
but there was no caption to the columns, but several judgments were entered in
them, it was held that s. judgment so entered was not void, when attacked by I.

“ Guilty of misdemeanor-."—If the indictment shows on its face that a period
of time elapsed between the expiration of the term of the defendant and the qualiﬁcation of his successor, it must negative the fact that the defendant delivered
the papers to the nearest justice as provided by the statute. State v. Jones, 10

§ 4144. Before issuing original process in any civil action,

May require

the Justice may require the plaintiff to give security for the
prosecution of the action, or take the oath entitling him to sue
without security.
See also Q 2818; § 8187; Q 8196 a.

The following form of undertaking, ab

tached beneath the warrant, is suggested as a good bond for costs, conforming
to the present law and the practice of the Circuit Court in such cases :—

“I acknowledge myself the plaintiff's security for the prosecution of the above
named suit with etfect, and for the payment of all costs that may at any time be
adjudged against him. This January 15, 1872.
John Brown.”
It will be sullicient if the surety alone sign the bond. The plaintiff is bound
without signing. If the bond is executed on a detached piece of paper, it should

identify the suit to which it belongs by stating the names of the parties, and the
court in which the suit is brought.

Broyles v. Blair, 7 Yerg. 279.

In such a

case the following is suggested as a suﬁcient form, and one that might well be
adopted in all cases :—

“ I, John Brown, acknowledge myself the plaintiifs security for costs in a suit
this day commenced by John Doe against Richard Roe before James Hall, Jus
tice of the Peace, and I hereby undertake to pay all costs that may at any time be
adjudged against the said plaintiff in the event such costs are not paid by him.

This January 15, 1872.

Substance of war1'¢mt.—It has been several times held under statutes confor

tain a statement of the trespass, injury or breach of contract for which the dam

ages are claimed. While little importance has been attached to the form of the
action [now abolished, see § 2746,] yet the cause of the action should be brieﬂy
but substantially set out.

But particularity of description will not be required.

will be sulﬁcient if the warrant indicate the nature of the injury complained of. Par

§ 9 Yerg. 416; Kirby v. Lee, 8 Yerg. 439 ; Hartin v. Edwards, 11 Humph. 374. Thus
it was held that if, as was stated, the damages sued for was for taking the plain

tiﬂ"s colt, the warrant should so state. 5 Yerg. 269. Or where the suit was
against the purchaser of cotton, on which the plaintiff, as landlord, had a lien for
rent. 6 Yerg. 260. Or where the suit was for the penalty given by statute
against a miller for not grinding in turn, or not keeping the measures required
bylaw. < Kirby v. Lee, 8 ‘Yerg. 439; Kirby v. Rice, Ib., 442. But strict and

technical nicety is not required. The warrant need not conclude against the stat
ute. It is suﬂicient if it notify the defendant in a plain and sensible manner why
he is sued. 8 Yerg. 441 ; Ib., 448. See Q 1926. And so under the Act of X799,
ch. 28, Q 2, which gave a penalty for enticing away a slave, it was suﬂicient that

the warrant summoned the defendant to answer a plea of debt, etc., for enticing
away and harboring a certain slave, without stating the county in which the of
fense was committed. Marshall v. Pennington, 8 Yerg. 424, 429-30. So, a war
rant requiring the defendant to answer a plea of damages occasioned by beating
and wounding the plaintiff, is good. 9 Yerg. 417. Where the wariant set out
the cause of action as fraud in the trade of a horse, representing the animal to be
sound when he was unsound; whereas, the ground of complaint as exhibited in
the proof was that the defendant had misrepresented the age of the horse, it was
held that the warrant did not suﬁcieutly notify the defendant of the cause of ac
tion, and did not support the judgment. Martin v. Edwards, 11 Humph. 374.
We can only expect and demand injustice’s proceedings such reasonable certainty
ns may be necessary for the attainment of justice. Wood v. Hancock, 4 Humph.
§ 465, 467. And so, under the old law before forms of action were abolished, where
a warrant required the defendant to answer “ in a plea of trespass under ﬁfty dol
lars " when the action was in fact trover for speciﬁc property, the judgment was

arrested.

Davis v. Parks, 6 Yerg. 252, 260.

But a warrant in “ trespass for lb;

fraudulent detention of a note, ” etc., was, though very informal, a good warrant

in trover.

And a warrant which summoned the defendant to answer the plaintiff

“in plea of trespass to his damage under twenty dollars, " was bad and ground of
arresting judgment, because it did not specify the nature of the trespass com
plained of. But this was under the Act of 1829, ch. 24, which contained the rig
orous provisions that iu case of the defendant’s failure to give bail, the constable

should commit him to the common jail until trial. Parris v. Brown, 5 Yerg. 267.
But a warrant against a public ferry-keeper for damages for refusing to set a pas
senger over the stream, need not set out tho name of the water-course, nor charge
that the defendant was keeper of n public ferry on the same. Wallen v. McKin
ney, 3 Humph. 245. Nor, where the warrant stated the action to be trespass for
damages to defendant by overﬂowing his land, was it necessary to allege in the

warrant that the land lay in the county of the venue.

It was sutiicient if it ap

peared in the evidence. Large v. Dennis, 6 Sneed, 595, 597. So liberal were the
courts in favor of justice’s proceedings even before the Code, and before the stat
ute ofjeofails of 1852, ch. 100, [Q 4176, ct aeg.,] that it was held that the several
forms of action and the rules which governed them, could not be enforced and
preserved in suits before justices. Bodenhamer v. Bodenhamer, 6 Humph. 264,
§ 267. And hence in actions before justices it was held that the bar of the statute
of limitations arose out of the evidence, and, as in courts of equity, must be ap
' plied according to truth and substance, and not according to the form of action.
Ib.; Merritt v. Parks, 6 Humph. 882, 336; Phipps v. Richmond, 1 Humph. 21;

Pike v. Greene, l Yerg. 465.

And the Words “plea of debt, ” in ujustioe’s war

rant must be molded to apply to accounts, assumpsit, damages for the non-com

pliance with a contract or legal duty, etc.

§ 6 Humph. 267-8.

The form ofaction

stated in the warrant is nothing. The justice must decide on the evidence. Large
_v. Dennis, 5 Sneed, 597. And all contracts are now sued in the same form of ac
tion in all courts. Q 2746. But while the mere form of proceedings before jus
tices will not be regarded, if they be, substantially, correct, so as to attain the
ends of justice; yet the two classes of actions arising ex dclicto and ea: contractu

cannot be united and blended together, without producingsuch confusion as must
result in injustice and injury to the one party or the other. Thus, where the plain
tiﬂ‘ had a demand for the proceeds of a sale of tobacco, which the defendant of

fered to pay, but which the plaintiff refused, and thereupon brought an action
against the defendant before a Justice of the Peace, for damages for selling the
tobacco contrary to instructions, it was held that he could not recover in this ac
tion the proceeds of the sale of the tobacco, for this would throw the costs upon

the defendant, through the plaintiff 's wrong.

§ 1680,

Beasley v. Bradley, 2 Swan, 180,

After appearance by defendant before the justice, and again in court on ap

peal, and trial on the merits without exception to the warrant, the judgment will
not be reversed because the warrant omits to state that the demand was for a less

sum than the limit of the justice’s jurisdiction, or that it was upon some instru
ment of writing under the defendant's signature. Baker v. Allen, 2Tenn. 175.
[These decisions, except the one in 6 Sneed, were rendcrcd before the passage of
Act of 1851-2, ch. 100, carried into the Code at {Q 4176-4178, which enact a
still more liberal rule.

Under Q 4177, which provides that ho civil case originat

ing before s. Justice of the Peace and carried to a higher court, shall be dismissed
by such courtfor any informality whatever, such a ruling as that made in Par
ris v. Brown, above quoted, where judgment was arrested in the Supreme Court

because thejustice's warrant did not state the nature of the injury sued for, could
not now be made.-Eds]
If the warrant is taken out against two, but is served only upon one, the Justice
may render judgment against the one served without taking further notice of the
other. It is not necessary in such a case, in a proceeding before a justice to en

ter a formal nollc prosequi as to the one not served.

Moon v. Harmon, 4 Yerg.

§ 21.

§ 4147. The constable is the proper executive oﬁicer of a 
Justice’s court, but the sheriff may perform any of the duties ‘harm
required.
It has also been held that a deputy sheriff may execute process issued by s Justice

of the Peace; for although there is no law directly conferring the power, yet the
usage has long prevailed, and several old statutes recognized it.

Union Bank v.

Lowe, lleigs, 225, 230. And see Estes v. Williams, Cooke, 413.
A Justice of the Peace has no authority to receive money on a judgment ren

dered by him.

Lytle v. Smith, 3 Humph. 327.

§ 4148. A. Justice may, in writing, specially depute any dis- ,,,,,,ce my

crcet person, of full age, not being a party, to perform any par- §l°il’e‘ii.° "°"°“'
ticular duty devolving upon a constable, if no constable is at
hand and the business urgent. [Act 1741, ch. 5, § 9.]
The original not was probably intended to apply to criminal cases ; but long
usage and the general understanding of the profession and judicial tribunals have

sanctioned the application of it to civil cases.

Hampton v. Allison, 9 Humph. 118.

'l'he power to appoint s. special deputy cannot be delegated or exercised by proxy.
Thus, where the justice did not know the christian name of the person he desired
to deputize, but wrote the deputation thus:

“ For want of oﬂicer I do hereby deputize
Hampton, to execute the within
process, and return it according to law," and authorised the plaintiff to ﬁll up the
blank with the christian name, and it was afterwards done by writing the word
“ William" in the blank, it was held that the deputation was void. Allison v.
llampton, 11 Humph. 71.

§ 4l4S a. That section 4148 of the Code of Tennessee be so 3“,

amended as to read as follows: A Justice may, in writing,m““ W!" em‘
specially depute any discreet person of full age, not being a party

by law upon a constable, if no constable is at hand and the
business urgent; but no magistrate, shall make such special

deputation unless one of the parties to a suit pending, or his or
§ 107 warm. srar.
her attorney, shall make oath before the magistrate, and ﬁle
the same in writing, stating that to the best of their informa
tion, there is no regular oﬁicer at. hand, and that the business

§ 4150. If the time and place of trial is not ﬁxed in the war
rant, the oﬁicer serving it shall notify the defendant of the

time and place, and make his return accordingly.
See also Q 2817.
§ 4151. The parties in all cases are entitled to one hour in
which to appear after the time ﬁxed for trial, and neither party is
bound to wait longer for the other.

Uontlnuances.

§ 4152. Continuances may be had, for the purpose of ob
taining evidence not then'in reach, upon good cause shown by
aﬂidavit, specifying the testimony relied on, and ﬁled with the
papers; but no second continuance, by the same party, shall
be allowed except on payment of all costs; nor third continu
ance unless the party applying shall give bond, with good
security, in a suﬂicient sum, to abide by and perform the judg
ment. The continuance shall in no case exceed sixty days.

[Act 1794, ch. 1, § 62; 1829, ch. 33.]
If after warrant sued out, the plaintitf fails to prosecute with diligence, the
suit may be discontinued on motion; but if the defendant go to trial on the
merits, he the-reby waives the right to move for a discontinuance, and cannot
afterwards do s0. Maynard v. May, 2 Oold. 44.

§ 4153. Either party applying fora continuance, shall, if re- -1-..i|m.,,.,,
quired by the opposite party, consent that the testimony of
any witness in attendance be then taken, to be used on the
trial of the cause.

§ 4l54. If neither party appears at the time and place ﬁxed ll,>§';;g1:_of W11
for trial, or demands a trial, and no evidence has been ﬁled
with the Justice, the suit shall be dismissed at the plaintiﬁ"s
cost.
§ 4155. If the defendant does not appear, the Justice shall 0, 
proceed to hear the allegations and proofs of the plaintiﬁ, and
shall renderjudgment thereon for the amount to which he shows
himself entitled under the warrant.
“Hear Me alZ¢gatiom.”—Tliese are oral. There is no law requiring any plead
ings to be made up ; nor is there any law requiring a written statement of the de
mand, other than the warrant itself. Baker v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 175. As a consequence
of there being no written pleadings before justices, there is no means of knowing
on appeal, what defense may or may not have been made; and the cause is, of
course, open for any and all legitimate defenses. Clark v. Howard, 10 Yerg. 250.
And no pleadings are required after the cause has been appealed to the circuit
' court. 2 Tenn. 175. The rule is said to be that pleadings before Justices of the
Peace, or in suits originating before them and carried to a higher court, are ore
tcmn, except in cases where it is required that the pleading should be made

under oath. Neville v. Northcutt, 7 Cold. 294, 298. Thus the plea of non eat
factum must be on oath and in writing, even before a Justice of the Peace. State
v. Roberts, 11 Humph. 589. Pleas which raise defenses which have arisen since the

last continuance, as for instance, that the defendant since the last continuance
has been adjudged a bankrupt, must likewise be sworn to, and of course to this end
would have to be reduced to writing. See Q 2909, and note. The plea of non-assig'n

ment, however, is not sworn to. See note to Q 2909, where the distinction between
this plea and non at factum by an endorser is shown.

It results from the plead

ings before a justice being 01-aicnus, that if a defendant is sued the second time
on the same demand, he must protect himself by averring and proving the pre
vious recovery or judgment. 2 Tenn. 175.

Statute of limitation.s.—This will be applied to the evidence and substance of
the case, and not to any words the justice may choose to use in the summons, [as
indicating the form of action.) Bodenharner v. Bodenhamer, 6 Humph. 264. [This
case, and also Phipps v. Richmond, 1 Humph. 21, are no longer of any value
as all contracts are sued on in the same form of action, even in courts of record.
-Eds]

EmZdence.—-Justices have powers like courts of record, to make orders, orissue
commission for the taking of depositions. See Q 3844 ; Q 3838. And see generally
the chapter on depositions, Q 3836, at seq. [The Title of the Code on evidence of
course applies to proceedings before Justices of the Peace.—Eds.] Several cases
originating before justices, have involved the construction of the book debt law—
such as Irwin v. Jordan, 7 Humph. 167; Johnson v. Price, 8 Head 549, and
perhaps others. See on this subject, Q 878l,et seq. [Several old cases originating
before Justices of the Peace, and which on the trial before the circuit or superior
court involved questions of evidence, are collected in King's Digest, Q2 7769, at
seq., but as they do not involve the construction of any of these statutes, they
will not be further noticed hcre.—Eds.] In actions brought before justices for
damages, in which cases the warrant is requiredto set forth with reasonable cer

tainty the cause of action, so as to notify the defendant in a plain and sensible
manner why he is sued, [note to @4146, ] the evidence must conform to the state
ment of cause of action in the warrant. Thus, where the warrant set forth the
cause of action asfraud in the sale of a horse in representing him to be sound,it.

was held that without an amendment of the warrant no proof could be had as to
the age of the horse; but if the cause of action had been stated generally as fraud

in the sale of the horse, it would have been competent to prove misrepresentation
in the age of the horse.

§ 4158. If he fails to comply with this requirement, and the
Justice renders judgment against him for the costs, the plaintiff

[Ib.]

§ 4160. If the defendant pleads a set-013' to the plaintiﬁ’s debt,
and it appears that there is a balance duo in favor of the de

fendant, the Justice shall enter up judgment in favor of the
defendant, and against the plaintiff for such balance.

[Act 1815, ch. 53,§1.]

But if trial is had, and the plaintiff fails in establishing any demand against the
defendant, the defendant cannot have a judgment against the plaintlﬂ’ for his set
§ 01!‘; for in such a case, there is no “ balance" due the defendant on a comparison

of I/heir accounts, but a separate independent demand. Edington v. Pickle, 1
Sneed, 122. 'I'his is also the rule in suits brought in the circuit court. See Q 2922
and note; 1 2964, note(b). So, in s. case appealed from ajustice where evidence
of a set-oﬂ had been given under the above Act of 1815, and the jury returned a
verdict in favor of the defendant for the sum of seventeen dollars, without mak
ing any response to the claim of the plaintiff, and thereupon the defendant dame
in and released the verdict for the said sum, it was held that there was nothing up
on which the court would render judgment, and that a vmire dc nova should be
awarded. Barnard v. Young, 5 Humph. 100, cited and followed in 1 Sneed, 126.

Plaintt] eamwt diamis.r.—-Upon the same principle it follows that a dismissal
of the plaintitfs suit would defeat the defendants plea of set-oil‘ ; accordingly it
has been held that after the defendant has ﬁled his plea of set-oﬂ‘, the plaintiif

has no power to dismiss his suit, and thereby defeat the defendant's cross-action.
Riley v. Garter, 8 Humph. 280.

§ 4l6l. If the sum found for either plaintiff or defendant M,,m|,,,,._

exceed the jurisdiction of the Justice, such party may remit

the excess, and take judgment for the residue; but he cannot
afterwards sue for the amount so remitted.

§ 4l62. If the residue upon the defendant’s set-off, after sat. when ems,
of defendant ’s

isfying the plaintiﬂ’s debt, exceed the magistrate’s jurisdiction, ;-ﬁt.-!<;1c1ee;lxf,euer',1:_
the defendant may enter on the Justice’s docket a satisfaction ‘"°“°"
of so much of his claim as the amount of the plaintiffs demand

as ascertained by the Justiee, and tender the plaintiff a receipt
for the amount thus set-off, in which case judgment shall be
rendered in favor of the defendant for costs.
Nor: to M 4160-4162.—C'on1truction.—As to set-oil‘ generally, see Q 2918 ct
aeq., and notes.—The acts giving the plea of set-oi? are founded upon principles of

equity, are wise in their provisions, and have been constantly enforced according
to their spirit. McClain v. Kincaid, 6 Yerg. 232, 234.
“Mutual dema.nds.“—See§ 2918, sub-sec. 1, and note. Demands may beset-off
against each other without regard to the nature of the security, so that the sum
demanded to be set-off be certain. Thus, in an action before a Justice of the Peace

upon a note, the defendant is entitled to set-oﬂ‘ an account. McClain v. Kincaid,
§ 5 Yerg. 232.
Juri-trliciion as to amolmt.—Under the old law, where the justice‘s jurisdiction
was one hundred dollars on a note and but ﬁfty dollars on an account, the defend
ant sued on a note might plead by way of set-oﬂ‘ an account, although the sum
claimed by such account were more than ﬁfty dollars, and the justice might render

judgment on such set-oﬂ, if the balance found due were within lulu jurisdiction.
The sum to be setroff cannot be material, so that the justice has jurisdiction of
the balance which may be found due. McClain v. Kincaid, 5 Yerg. 232. Applying
this rule to Q 4123, sub—secs. 1 and 2, it would follow that a defendant sued on a
note may plead by way of set-oif an account for any sum, but ajustice could not
render a judgment in favor of the defendant for more than two hundred and ﬁfty

dollars. And this, was in effect held in Crow v. Cunningham, 5 Cold. 255, 260.
On appeal from Justice.—If a defendant who is entitled to a sct-offfail to bring
it forward before a.-Tustice of the Peace, he may nevertheless set it up in the circuit court on appeal, in the same manner that he might have done before the justice.
McClain v. Kincaid, 5 Yerg. 232; Crow v. Cunningham, 6 Cold. 255 -9. And
in such a case, the circuit court cannot render ajudgment in favor of the defend
ant for an amount exceeding the jurisdiction oi‘ the justice, any more than the
justice himself could have done so; and where such a judgment is rendered in the
circuit court, it is not cured by remitting the excess.

§ 4173. Justices of the Peace have jurisdiction to proceed by
attachment against the property of the defendant, in the same

way as the courts of record, under the rules, regulations, and
provisions in this Code prescribed in regard to proceedings by

attachment, as far as the same are applicable, and not controll
ed by other express provisions.
See the chapter on attachments, Q 3455 at seq.—Under the old Act of 1794, at
tachments issued by justices were not levlable on realty, and such s levy was
void.

Puckett v. Owen, Peck, 167; Hodges v. Wharton, 1 Yerg. 125.

But the
rule is otherwise under the Code. See Q 8587, prescribing the proceeding where
a justice’s attachment is levied on land.
Jurisdiction.

§ 4174. The jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace in such

cases, is limited to the amount of their jurisdiction over the
subject-matter of suit, or cause of action.

[Act 1843-4, ch. 29, §7 ; 1851-2, ch. 177, § 2.]
Until the Act of 1848-4, the jurisdiction of justices by attachment was very
limited; but that Act made thisjurisdiction co-extensive with the jurisdiction by
warrant, which at that time did not exceed two hundred dollars. Afterwards
the Act of 1849-50, ch. 269 was passed, extending the justicc‘s jurisdiction on
certain written instruments to ﬁve hundred dollars, as provided in § 4123, sub
sec. l. This was followed by the Act of 1851-2, ch. 157, which again made jus
tices’ jurisdiction by attachments co~extensive with their jurisdiction by warrant.

Apperson v. Looney, 2 Swan, 664.

The jurisdiction of justices in actions for

damages under the Code, was ﬁfty dollars only. Q 4123, sub-sec. 3. But since
the Code, the jurisdiction of justices in suits for damage: has been increased, ﬁrst
by the Act of 1859-60, ch. 65, to one hundred dollars, and again by the Act of
§ 1865-6, ch. 51, to two hundred and ﬁfty dollars. [And now, the question may
arise, whether by operation of the above section of the Code a justice can issue
an attachment for agreater sum than ﬁfty dollars where the action is for a tort.
lfwe follow the dicta in Apperson v. Looney, above quoted, which is to the effect
that the jurisdiction of justices in attachment cases will not be extended by con
struction, the answer would be no. But the case of Stewart v. Vaughn, 3 Cold.
§ 22, 24, contains dicta. which would indicate a contrary rule, namely, that constru

ing the Act of 1860 with the provisions of the Code, and the Schedule to the
amended Constitution of 1865, the jurisdiction in such case was limiled to one
hundred dollars. And now, construing together the provisions of the Code, and
Q 4123 a, and Q 3459a it is probable that the justice’s jurisdiction by attachment
in eases of tort is co-extensive with his jurisdiction by warrant.-—Eds.]
By gornishment.-Until the Act ol‘ 1815, ch. 20, § 8, a justice had no power
to summon a gsrnisheo in an attachment proceeding. Seawell v. Murphy, Cooke,
§ 478. But now ajustice may renderjudgment against a garnishee to the extent

cecdlngs.

§ 4176. Every intendruent is in favor of the sufficiency and

validity of proceedings before Justices of the Peace, when
brought in question, either directly or collaterally, in any of
the courts of the State, where it appears on the face of the pro
ceedings that the Justice has jurisdiction of the subject-matter
and of the parties. [Act 1851-2, ch. 100, § 1.]
Seeﬂ 4I32.—As early as 1812, it was held that proceedings before justices
should be favored as much as the rules prescribed by the Legislature will permit.
Baker v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 275. But in a later case it was said that in proportion

as their jurisdiction increases as to amount, there should be an increase of strict
ness and regularity in their proceedings. Oftentimes the amount of judgments
rendered by justices involves all the property of those in the humbler walks
of life; and to such, the justice’s judgments are of as serious consequence as

heavier judgments against the wealthy in the higher tribunals. Patrick v. Drie
kell, 7 Yerg. 140. And it is again said that the extensive and varied jurisdiction
conferred on Justices of the Peace, would seem to require that there should be

substantial accuracy at least in their proceedings.

This is demanded by what is

due to the rights and interests of parties, to what is due to the protection and se
curity of oﬂicers who execute the process, and of persons who may become pur
chasers of property at their sales. Hubbard v. Birdwell, 11 Humph. 221. But it
is said that to require strict and formal practice in these inferior tribunals would
be to destroy their jurisdiction, and in its results do serious injury, perhaps, to

the community. When we consider how extensive is the jurisdiction of these
magistrates’ courts, embracing a great variety of subjects, not cognizable origin
ally in any superior forum, we cannot but see the necessity of making great allow
ance for their informal and irregular proceedings. This view of the subject has
been taken in many reported cases. Substantial accuracy is all that can be had,
or will be required in their proceedings. Glass v. Stovall, 10 Humph. 458-4.
Thus, in an old case the court of errors refused, after appearance and trial on the

merits without exception to the warrant, to reverse a justice‘s judgment because
the warrant omitted to state that the demand was for less than ﬁfty dollars, [the
then jurisdiction except on notes and signed accounts,] or that the instrument sued
on was signed by the defendant. Baker v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 175.
Certainty in thejudgment.-It has been held that a memorandum on a warrant.
“judgment $37.00," is void for uncertainty.

Such an entry does not show in

whose favor the judgment was rendered.

It might be for the plaintiff, or itmight

be for the defendant on a plea of set-oﬁ'.

Hubbard v. Birdwell, 11 Humph. 220-1.

A judgment formally entered but ante-dated, and rendered in the absence of the
defendant and without notice to him, after the cause has been continued, but not
to any certain day, and without any trial of the matter in dispute between the par

ties, is void, and execution thereon will be quashed on certiorari for this purpose.
Hubbard v. Birdwell, 11 Humph. 220. But where the defendant had been sum
moned, and on the day appointed went to the justice's house, and there learned
that be had gone south; and afterwards the justice returned and gave judgment

against him, without notice, and without giving him an opportunity to defend, it
was held that the judgment was not void, and that although the defendant had
good ground for certiorari for new trial, yet he could not have the execution on
such judgment quashed on certiorari for that purpose. West v. Williamson, 1

Swan, 277. Where there were several defendants, a judgment endorsed on the
warrant, "judgment in favor of the plaintiif for sixty-one dollars and eighty-threeN mvon or JUs'r1c1ts’s PROCEEDINGS.
cents and costs,”was a valid judgment against all the defendants.

Parker v.Swan,

§ 1 Humph. 80, 83.

How attacked.—No objection can be taken collaterally to any proceeding be
fore a justice, if it appear fair and regular on its face, and relate to n subject
within his jurisdiction; but the objection must be taken directly in a suit impeach
ing the proceeding before the justice, and seeking to have it corrected or annull
ed. Hubbard v. Birdwell, ll Humph. Q20-1. This may be done by causing the

execution to be certiﬁed to the Circuit Court, [by certiorari in lieu of appeal] ;
and when this is done, parol evidence is admissible to show the true state of the
case. Ib. And see to the same effect West v. Williamson, 1 Swan, 277, above

quoted. In a collateral proceeding, as certiorari in lieu of audita querela, sued
out to quash execution, the rule is that a justicc’s judgment, valid oniis face, can.
not be attacked by evidence dehors the proceeding. Mason v. Westmoreland, 1
Head, 565; Witt v. Russey, 10 Humph. 208; Taliaferro v. Herring, 10 Humph.
Thus, in such a proceeding it cannot be shown by extrinsic evidence that

the justice rendering the judgment had no jurisdiction of the subject matter; as
where it was alleged that the judgment was rendered against the defendant as an
endorser above the sum of ﬁfty dollars, and that demand and notice were not
waived in the instrument sued on, the note sued on could not be looked to to

show the want of jurisdiction. lb.

To have availed himself of this want of jur

isdiction, the defendant should have appealed, if he knew of the judgment within
the time allowed for appeal, and if he did not, the fact should have been stated
as a legal excuse for not appealing, and the ce1"i*im-ari should have been for a new
trial, and not to quash the judgment and execution. Where this is done, it may,
in a new trial in the Circuit Court, he shown, as a matter of evidence, that the
justice had no jurisdiction. 1 Head, 556-7-; 10 Humph. 209. S0, it cannot be
shown by a stayor, on eertiorari to quash the execution against him, that the
judgment was given on a confession, without suﬂicient legal authority. 10 Humph.
§ 272. If the judgment is valid on its face, it cannot be impeached in the Circuit
Court by adefendant whose land has been levied on and the papers certiﬁed to
the Circuit Court for condemnation. Turner v. Ireland, ll Humph. 447. Nor in
such a case by a stayor. Anderson v. Kimbrough, 5 Cold. 260, 262. The con
verse of this doctrine is also true, namely, that a justice‘s judgment, void on its
face, cannot be aided by extrinsic evidence. McClellan v. Cornwell, 2 Cold. 298,
§ 303.

Jur1Isdictt'o1t.—If the justice has no jurisdiction over the subject matter the
want of it cannot be cured by appearance, plea, consent or otherwise, but the

judgment must remain to all intents and purposes absolutely null and void. But
it is not so in the case of a want of jurisdiction over the person. This is a per
sonal privilege, and if the party seeks to avail himself of it, he must do it, if he
appear, by plea in abatement; for if he enter an appearance and suffer a judg
ment by default, or it‘ he plead to-the merits of the case and go to trial, he has
waived his privilege, and shall not be permitted afterwards to reassert it. Agee v
Dement. 1 Humph. 332.

deemed just and proper.
See Q 2863 ct seq. ; Q 2875 and note.—As to the power of Justices to correct
their judgments, sce Q 2879 a.—Where amotion was made before a justice against
n constable for failing to pay over money collected on execution and appealed
to the Circuit Court, it was said that the circuit court not only had power, but
it was its duty to permit the original motion, brought. into court by the appeal,
to be so amended as to make the suit one as well for the delinquency for which
it was bought before the justice, as for allinsiiﬂicicnt returns an the same exc

Appeal bond
presumptive
-lrappc.-al._

King v. Breeden, 2 Cold. 455, 462.

§ 4178. An appeal bond returned with other papers to the
Circuit Court, in prima facie evidence that an appeal was
prayed and granted, but the presumption may be rebutted by
proof that an appeal was not prayed and obtained within the
time allowed by law.

[Ib., § 3.]

Before this statute, it was held that a recital in an appeal bond was not of
itself proof of an appeal prayed and granted. Cooley v. Julin, 5 Yerg. 439; Rogers

v. Hill, 1 Ycrg. 400.

In order to give the Circuit Court jurisdiction of the case,

it was necessary that the papers from before the justice should show that an

appeal had been prayed and granted from his judgment, the mere recital in the
appeal bond not being sullicient for this purpose. Hall v. Bewley, 11 Humph.
§ 106. Nor did the Act of 1821,.ch. 21, Q l, [see Q 2875,] authorize the entry of

an appeal where no entry had been made by the justice allowing it, and the
only evidence that it had been prayed and granted was the recital in the con
dition of the appeal bond. Dicmm in Rogers v. Cochran, 3 Yerg. 311. But
where the justice omitted to enter the fact that an appeal was prayed and
granted, the justice might, on motion in the Circuit Court, supply the defect by
amending the papers in conformity to the recitals in the appeal bond. Lawler v.
Howard, Meigs, 15; citing in support of this position a dictum in Cooley v_
Julin, above quoted. And in Hull v. Bewley above quotcd,it was even said that un
der the Act of 1821, [see Q 2875,] the amendment need not be made in the Circuit
Court by thejustice ; but where the record showed that such an amendment was
made in the Circuit Court, but did not show by whom it was made, the Supreme

Court might reasonably infer, in the absence of proof, that it was the justice who
made it. Ib. But where a warrant was returned before a justice for trial, and
there appeared endorsed on the warrant, but without being signed by the jus
tice, the following entries : “Judgment against the plaintiff for costs of suit.“
“from which the plaintiﬂ' prays an appeal, which is granted,"-— this though

informal and imperfect, was held sufficient evidence of ajudgment and an ap
peal to warrant the Circuit Court in taking jurisdiction, no exceptions having
been taken in the Circuit Court.

Glass v. Stovall, 10 Humph. 453.

And since the above statute, it is hcld in conformity with Lawler v. Howard,
above quoted, that where the justice’s entries do not show that an appeal was

prayed an.d granted, but the bond does, the Circuit Court should, under Q 2875,
(which see,) permit the justice to amend. McCarver v. Jenkins, 2 Heisk. 629,
§ 633.
IIBCILLLIIOUB DECISIONS RELAUKG TO PROCEEDINGS BEFORE JU8'l'ICES

A justice has no power to render a “conditional judgment ,-" as where the de
fendant told him that there was something wrong about the notes sued on, but he
might enter a conditional judgment, it was held that the justice neither had power
to enter a conditional judgment nor an absolute judgment by confession. Gwinn v.

Newton, 8 Humph. 7 l0.

§ 1692

[This, of course, has no reference to a conditional judgment against a. gnrnishee in default of answer, which a justice has power to enter.

See§ 3091; §§s4se,a4s7J
Canceling sal_isfaction.——Where a judgment has been paid, and satisfaction

Evidence of acts ofjustice.-—If :1 paper issued by a justice is offered in evidence,
it must be proved to be genuine, and to have been really issued by the justice; to
do which any witness is as competent as the justice himself. Osborne v. State,

[Act 1s35, ch. 6, § 2.]
In all cases where a speciﬁed number or portion oi‘ the Justices of the Pence are
required to be present in the County Court for any given purpose, the record
should show that such number were present, and constituted the court when the

business was done.

An appropriation of public money to the use of an individual

is one oi‘ those cases ; and an order made to appropriate money where the record
does not show that the requisite number were present, is a nullity. Coleman v.

Smith, Mart. dz Yerg. 36; Q 1185 and note.

But where it is made requisite by

statute to the validity of a particular order or decree that a certain number of jus
tices be present when it is passed, it_is not necessary that the entry of such order
or decree should have incorporated intoit a statement that the requisite number

were present. It will be suiﬁcient if the record [that is the caption of the day’s
proceedings,] shows that on that day the requisite number were present. McCul

by simple calculation, ascertaining the share oi‘ the distributes or legatee, and
upon this to make an order for the payment of the interest thus summarily ascer
-tained. _The majority of the court say it could not have been contemplated that
the county court should havejurisdiction to construe wills, to try questions of set
off, to pass upon complicated accounts between the executor and distributee or
legatee, to try questions of iui‘anc_v or other complicated fact. These are matters
of litigation which cannot be tried in a summary proceeding. Under this stat
ute the only power the County Court has is sitnply to order the payment of the
legacy or distributives share, readily ascertained without complication or plausi

ble dispute, and without issue or litigation. It was not intended that the exe
cutor or administrator should answer with a view to litigate and cont-est. The
petition is only to perform the olﬁce ofa notice in a summm-y proceeding, the
statute, [Q 2314,] expressly declaring that the proceeding shall be summarily

heard, and determined as soon as practicable.

Hence, where a petition was ﬁled

against an administrator with the will annexed, to compel him to pay over a
legacy ol'$lO0, with interest, to which he answered, admitting the right to the
legacy, but insisting that he had paid it, and the answer was controverted on the
ground that the payment was made to the petitioner while under age, and in Con
federate treasury notes, it was held that the County Court had no jurisdiction.

§ 4204. The County Court is, moreover, in cases of conciir-(,~.,,,,.,,,,,,,_,.

rent jurisdiction, vested with all the incidental powers be-j"mmu°n'
longing to, or conferred by law upon the court with which
its jurisdiction is concurrent, for the purpose of exercising
and effectuating such jurisdiction. [Act 1851-2, ch. 92.]
§ 45205. The court may, accordingly, appoint commissioners we 0, mp.

to make sale of real or personal property, taking bond and se-my‘
curity for the faithful performance of duty, when deemed nec
essary; may revise, set aside, or conﬁrm the proceedings of
such commissioners, as other courts ; give judgments or decrees

upon notes and obligations taken in the progress of a cause;
and relieve, upon petition, any purchaser or party, or person

interested, by opening biddings, setting aside sales, or otherwise
like the Circuit or Chancery Court in similar cases.
The shove two sections are merely declaratory of the law as it previously existed
in regard to the juristliction oi‘ the court to sell land for partition, without vesting
in that tribunal any new or more extended power or authority. Bond v. Clay, 2
Head, 379; examined, and the same doctrine nﬂirmctl in Young v. Thompson, 2
Cold. 596, 600; and in Porter v. Woodard, 4 Cold. 598. Hence where land has
been sold by the County Court for. partition, the sale conﬁrmed and title vested,
the County Court has no power to set aside the conﬁrmation and release the pur
' chaser, on the ground ofa supposed defect in the title. 2 Head, 379; citing Young
i 1. Shurnatc, 8 Sneed, 369, where the some doctrine is held. The jurisdiction of the

County Court [over this subject,] though of an equitable nature is very limited
in extent. It is merely what the statute has expressly conferred, and nothing more.
It extends simply to the making and completion of the sale in the particular case,
and when that is accomplished the jurisdiction is exhausted, except for the purpose
of rendering judgment by motion for the purchase money, if not paid when the

note or obligation falls due; to do which, authority is given by statue. It is cer
tainly true that before the conﬁrmation of the report, the sale being incomplete,
the court necessarily possesses tiis incidental power of setting the salc aside and

of discharging the purchase. But it is no less clear that ajter the sale has been
completed, by conﬁrmation of the report, and decree visiting the title in the pur
chaser, if any matter of equity exist ofashould arise, entitling the purchaser to be

relieved against the payment of the consideration money, resort must be had to a
court of equity. The simple power to ronderjudgment by motion against the pur
chnser upon his obligation for the purchase money cannot be held to invest the
County Court with jurisdiction to declare the sale void, either on the ground of
fraud or irregularity in the proceedings. No such jurisdiction exists in that tri
bunal. 3 Snccd, 369-71-2; quoted approvingly in Young v. Thompson, 2 Cold.
§ 596, 599. Before the conﬁrmation of the 1-cportof sale, the sale is incomplete,
and the County Court possesses the incidental power of setting it aside; but the
conﬁrmation of the report of the sale, the purchaser having complied with the
terms, not only completes the sale, but, at least in the case of the sale of person~
alty where no lien is retained, vests in the purchaser agood and valid title to the

property. This is said to be the well settled doctrine on this subject, recognized
in the case of Curd v. Bonner, [4 Cold. 682,] at the same term. 2 Cold. 601.
Hence if the conﬁrmation of the report not only completes the sale, but also
vests the purchaser with a title to the property as eﬂ'ectually as a decree,upon its face
and in express terms divesting and vesting title, there is_no reason for the appli
cation of a ditferent rule. Hence, where slaves were sold by the County Court
for distribution, and the sale conﬁrmed, and notes given for the purchase money,
but the cause still retained in court, the County Court had no authority to sot
aside the sale and cancel the notes given for thc purchase money, on the ground
that since the conﬁrmation of the sale the slaves had been emancipated by a con
stitutional ordinance; and such an order was a mere nullity, and had no eﬂ'ect. up
on the rights oi‘ the parties. 2 Cold. 596-602. The principle declared in the
preceding case is also recognized in Porter v. Woodard, 4 Cold. 598, 599 ; and the
same cases, together with Porter v. Woodard, are cited approvingly in Dean v.

Snelling, 2 Hcisk. 484, 488.
“ Give ju.d_qment—upon notes"; etc.—Euch of the courts, County, Circuit and
Chancery possesses this power. Still v. Boon, 6 Sueed, B80. The County Court

is empowered to render judgment upon notes taken as prescribed in the above
section, upon motion and without notice. This being a summary proceeding,
very fact which is necessary to give the court jurisdiction and to authorize the judg
ment must be set out in the judgment. as having been made to appear. Ruclter v.
More, 1 Heisk. 726, 732; citing 5 Humph. 426; 3 liumph. 316; 3 Cold. 2l9. See
also note toQ 3683; Q 3204, last part of note; note toé 3594, p. 1493; note

to 4 3603.
Writ of possession.—Whilc the County Court possesses the powers above enu

merated, yet it has no power to issue a writ of possession in favor of the purchas
er at one of its sales. Its jurisdiction over the sale of lands is purely statutory,
and the above sections do not confer this power. Porter v. Woodard. 4 Cold. 498.

Jzarbxdictioit in 7>artition.—Sce Q 4201, sub-secs. 5 and 9; Q 3266.

Under the

Act of 1787, ch. 17, the County Court was possessed of general jurisdiction in cases
of partition. Wilcox v. Cannon, 1 Cold. 369. This jurisdiction iv continued by

‘the Code, Q 4201, sub-secs. 5 and 9. And the jurisdiction of the County Court
over this subject is concurrent with that of the Circuit and Chancery Courts.
Q3226.

It follows that whichever court takes jurisdiction of the subject, its

jurisdiction is ﬁnal and conclusive upon the others.

Thus, the County Court,

having made a decree for partition, it cannot be reviewed in the Chancery Court»

nor can that court again adjudicate upon the same subject matter. Gass v. Hawk
ins, 1 Thomp. Cns. 238. The County Court being n court of general jurisdiction
over this subject, it follows thatits proceedings in partitioning estates will be pre
sumed to be correct, in the absence of proof‘to the contrary, when collaterally
brought in question. 1 Cold. 369. But the County Court has no jurisdiction of n
case of partition where itis necessary as a preliminary to settle title. Dean v. Snell

ing, 2 Heisk. 484.

The rule that the ﬁling of an answer in the Chancery Court

isa waiver if objections to the jurisdiction to decree upon matters properly of
legal cognizance, has no application to the jurisdiction of the County Court. Ib.
An answer toa petition for partition in the County Court does not waive an objec

tion to the right of the court to try and adjudge title, but the petition will be
-dismissed at the hearing. Ib.

The court say, that but for the adjudicated cases

to the contrary, the Chancery Court seemsto be an especially appropriate tribunal
to determine questions of title preliminary or incident to a partition.

And the

Reporter adds in a note that this power is expressly conferred by Q 8277 of the
'Code. Ib., 490. [But see Gass v. Hawkins l Thomp. Cas. 238, and the cases
collected in the Editor's note; from which the rule would seem to be that where
the legal title is in dispute, the Chancery Court will not decree partition, until
the rights of the parties are settled at law; but where there are merely equities
to settle, the Chancery Court will assume jurisdiction, and in the same proceed

ing, settle the rights of the parties and decree partition.—Eds.]

§ 4906. The establishment and general supervision of roads :'!.l<;i:tl:laa‘l'lmprov0
and ferries, water-courses and local improvements, is intrusted

to the County Court, as provided in sections 1241-1273.
[Act 180-L, ch. 1; 1835, ch. 29, § 1. ]
See also Q 1183 ct scq.—- The Legislature has considered the county court the
-proper depository of the jurisdiction over roads, ferries and bridges. Their local
‘residence presumes a knowledge of the public interest in these matters in gener

ll)’ and as having the best means of acquiring information upoif, and examining
the merits of the respective applications that may be made to them.

It might per

haps have been the original intention of the Legislature that this jurisdiction should
be exclusive in the county court. Be that as it may, the old Superior courts, and
after them the circuit courts haveundertaken tocontrol the exercise of this jurisdic
tion in some particularinstances ; and the Supreme court, the jurisdiction being set

"tled, has the right of examining the judgment of the circuit court, and consequently
-'tl1e decision of the county court.

ln doing so, the Supreme court as a revising

rtribunal, must not forget the latitude oi‘ discretion necessarily bestowed on the
county court in tho exercise of this jurisdiction, and the superior means possessed
‘by them for the correct exercise of it, compared to what this court may be rea

-sonably supposed to possess.

And the corrective power of the Supreme court

in this class of cases, is called into action to distinguish between a reasonable

-exercise by the county court of its discretion, and a gross departure therefrom.
Blair v. Carmichael

§ 2 Yerg. 306.

The jurisdiction of the county court over the

subject of roads is general and exclusive.

Hence, it follows that. where the record

-shows a competent court, that is, the competent. number of justices to have been
present, every presumption exists in favor of the regularity of the proceeding.

And where a public road has been established by a. competent court, and its ju
risdiction therein remains unreversed, it is not competent in a collateral proceed"
ing, as, for instance, a criminal prosecution for obstructing the road so established,
to show informalities and defects in the orders taken in the county court to es
tablish i\', but the person interested must object to the proceeding when it took

place, or otherwise reverse it upon appeal in error. Mankin v. State, 2 Swan,
§ 206. So in an action for the penalty given by} 1237, for obstructing a public
road, where the defendant justiﬁed under an order of the county court authorizing
him to close the road, he having opened a new road around his farm, which the
county court accepted in lieu of the old one, it was held that the fact that the

new road was not accepted upon the report of a jury of view, could not be
brought in question. The court was of the opinion that a proceedingin the coun
ty court opening a public road is not such a proceeding us requires that all the
facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction should be recited in the judgment,
and the judgment being valid on its face, cannot be attacked in a collateral proceed

ing, and shown to be void by parol evidence.

Any person Feeling himself aggrieved

by ajudgment of the county court in such aproceeding has his right of appeal

to have its errors reviewed and corrected; but it is clear that ajudgment not
void on its face, cannot be attacked in any collateral proceeding, and shown by

parol to be a nullity. Stanley v. Sharp, 1 lieisk. 417, citing authorities.

Tha

counly court cannot, under the constitution, impair the privilege granted to a turn
pike company by opening sh/mpilt-es, to enable persons to avoid the payment of
toll. Franklin it Columbia Turnpike C0. v. County Court of liaury, 8 Humph. 842.
And if it make such an order, and the shunpike is opened, the chancery court will

order it to be closed, as a violation of chartered rights.

lb.—Iu contests in the

county court between the-public and citizen relative to the establishment of roads,

eognizable in the court ofpleas and quarter sessions in Tennessee, as in the spirit
ual courts of England. But since the Constitution of 1834, the County Court

Taylor v. Pope, 5 Cold. 413, -125.

Where

the writ and declaration are for a sum within thejurisdiction of the Circuit Court,
but upon trial, a verdict is rendered for a sum less than ﬁfty dollars, the judg
ment cnnnot be arrested. If the defendant knows that the action is brought for
a sum under the jurisdiction of the court, no matter what may be the sum laid in
the writ and declaration, he has the right to put the question of jurisdiction in
issue by a. plea in abatement. If this is not done—-the writ and declaration show

ing, primafacia, a cause of action for a sum within thejurisdiction, and the mat
ter in abatement having been waived,--it is too lute to take advantage of the
question of the jurisdiction,_ when it is discovered by verdict that the sum

was less than thejurisdiction.

The same rul

ing was made in Martin v. Carter, 1Yerg.489. [These rulings are based upon the
Act of 1803, ch. 5, Q2, which provided that if any suit should be commenced
fur u less sum than ﬁfty dollurs, said suit should abate on plea of the defendant.
This Act applied only to the old court of pleas and quarter sessions, and seems

to be omitted from the (lode. See QQ 2902, 2903, where the various grounds of
the abatement of actions prescribed by statute or recognized by judicial decisions
are enumerated.;—Eds.] When the debt or demand is rendered below the amount
necessary to give the court jurisdiction, bypagpnmis made on that parliculm-debt

with power to order and take all proper accounts, and other

wise to perform the functions of a Chancery Court.
[Act 1851-2, ch. 152, § 9.]
The construction of this section came under consideration in an action

brought in the Circuit Court for work and labor done on defendant's railroad,
nndfor damages for being ejected from the work. The Circuit Court refused
after the trial had conslderuldy progressed, on motion of the defendant, to take
the case from the jury and rcfcr it to the clerk or a commissioner, to state an
account under the shove section. It was held this was not error. The court
say that the above provision has no application to such a case as the one in
question; but covers cases where a suit is brought in a court of law, which from

its nature and character is perfectly cognizablc in a court of equity, and the de
fendant fails to demur.

In such a case, the plaintiff shall not be denied the re

lief to which he is entitled upon the merits of his case by the dismissal of his
suit with costs; but the circuit judge may,at his discretion, transfer the case
to the Chancery Court, or retain it in his own court, and determine it upon prin
ciples of equity, order all proper accounts, and otherwise exercise the functions ofa

chancellor in reference to it.

But that does not mean that in a case of sim

ple legul character, the Circuit Court may assume the functions of a. court of equi
ty, because some equitalbc defense is set up, or a case is developed in the proof

of which a court of equity might have exercised a concurrent jurisdiction, if that
forum had been selected in the ﬁrst instance.

In such a case, the same general

principle would apply since, as before the Code, that the tribunal ﬁrst taking ju
risdiction should retain it. Sewauee Mining Co. v. Best, 3 Head. 701, 793.

See Car. Lawsuit, § 278; Q1 2951, 2952, supra, and notes; § 2945 and note.
Where a sunnnons was retumed to a term of the court which by reason of the
absence of the Judge was not held, but at which term the plaintiff ﬁled his declar
ation, to which the defendant failed to plead, it was held that on the ﬁrst day of
the next succeeding regular term, the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment by de
fault. Brient v. Waterﬁeld, 5 Sneed, 587. See note to proceeding section ; also
Q 4224. The plaintiff cannot take judgment by default for failing to plead until
after the expiration of the time allowed for pleading, although the term of court
adjourn before the expiration of such time. In such a case the plaintiff will be
entitled to ajndgment by default on the ﬁrst day of the next term. Byrd v.
Bank of Tenn., 2 Swan, 43. The old case of Findley v. Johnson, 1 Tenn. 344,
stated the practice, (which had become the law of the land,) to be, that the rules
are taken at the close of the term, ordinarily on the last day, when it is usual for
the parties to waive the time allowed for pleading, if not expired, and make up
their issues by consent, so as to be ready for the trial at the succeeding term.
If the plaintiff desires to take judgment by default for want of a plea, he must do
it on the seventh day of the term. [But this was under the old Act of 1794, ch.
§ 1, Q 26, which gave the plaintiff three days in which to declare, and the defendant
three day in which to plead. By the present law, it would be the sixth day.] This is
done usually in the morning; for the court will not permit trials to be interrupted
by motions. In case the plaintiff permits the seventh day to pass without taking
judgment by default, it is avirtual waiver until the rules are held, when he may again
call for the defendant, and if he does not appear and plead, judgmentby default pas
ses. But even at the rules, this judgment must be regularly taken, that is, when the
cause is called by the clerk in the order in which it stands on the docket ; otherwise
it may be set aside for irregularity at any time while the rules are holding, without

an aﬁidavit of merits.

[This case, decided in the old Superior Court, in 1808, is

believed to be inapplicable, or but partially applicable to present practice, particu
larly in the circuit and special courts which have crowded dockets, and where mo
tion dockets are kept and called once a week. Even in such cases, where judg
ment by default for failure to plead has not been taken by motion entered on the
motion docket, it has been held by some of the circuit judges, that the plaintiff is
entitled, as a matter of right, to judgment by default, on verbal motion, on the last

day of the term.-—Eds.]

§ 4240 The plaintilf and defendant shall, within the ﬁrst g.,b,,q,,m
two days after each subsequent step taken by the other in pleadh.'“'
making up an issue, demur or plead thereto, on penalty of
having the suit dismissed, or judgment taken by default,
according as the failure is by the pl-aintiﬂ' or defendant. [Ib.]
Thus, after the time for ﬁling a replication is passed, the plaintiff may be non
suited for failing to take this step. But in such a case if the defendant, instead
of non-suiting the plaintiif, elect to go to trial upon the issues made in the case,

he cannot, after verdict, be heard to complain that he has not had trial of a plea.
to which there was no replication or issue, but will be held to have waived the

defense set up in such plea. Harris v. Snider, 9 Humph. 748, 745. A judgment
cannot be rendered upon a verdict where there are no pleas and no issues to try,
and such a judgment is erroneous and reversible. The proper course in such a
case is to take judgment by default. Hop>on v. Fountain, 4 Humph. 243. A.

the judgment by default, the plaintiff, in the ascertainment of the actual damages
sustained, is entitled to no greater latitude, either in respect of the admission of
evidence, or the extent of his right of recovery, than he would be upon the trial
of an issue joined. Thus, where the declaration was in covenant, the plaintiff, on
inquiry of damages, was only entitled to recover damages on the breaches alleged.
Eastman v. Crowder, 10 Humph. 194. If the plaintiﬁ"s cause of action is def»

tivcly stated, the Supreme Court will, after judgment by default, disregard the
defects or omissions. But if no cause of action be stated at all, as where in asuit
against maker and endorsers on a prommissory note, the declaration omits to
state that there was demand of payment and notice of non-payment to the en
dorsers,-the Supreme Court will not, after judgment by default, sustain the judgment as against an endorser; but in such a case where the omitted facts may ex

mcnt at law, unless defence was not made for lack of opportunity, or remedy lost.

through accident, mistake or fraud, unmixed with negligence. Seny v. Hughes, 5
Sneed, 115. Ignorance of a defence is not suﬂicient. George v. Alexander, 6
Cold. 641; but see 2 Heisk. 329. Judgment at law by undue advantages. Hulcombe v. Cannday 2 Heisl-:. 610. A court of equity having jurisdiction to set
aside a fraudulent judgment ac-ainst a will in the circuit court, has jurisdiction
for all purposes upon a bill which prays for an account and adjustment of all

rights under the will. Smith v. Harrisson, 2 Heisk. 230.

But will not attempt

to determine the validity of the will itself. Ib. A party cannot obtain aid from
Chancery after a judgment at law, unless he can impeach the verdict on ground
not available at law, or unless prevented from making his defence by fraud, acci-»
dent or mistake, or the act of the adverse party, unmixed with negligence, and.
all must be speciﬁcally alleged in the bill. Levan v. Patton, 2 Heisk. 109.
It is a ground of Chancery jurisdiction that there is some obstruction to the~

jurisdiction of acourt of law, which the aid of a court of equity is required
to remove. That such ﬁnal complete and adequate relief cannot be given by a
court of law, as can be afforded in a court ofChuncery. Almony v. Hicks, 3 Head, 42;
Porter v. Jones, 6 Cold. 816.
An instrument may bevoid upon lI.S face, so that
no suit could be maintained upon it; yet acourt of equity will decree it can
celled. Ib; Jones v. Perry, 10 Yerg. 69, 83 ; Johnson v. Cooper, 2 Yerg. 531 ;
Hamilton v. Cummings, 1 John. Ch. 522; contra, 2 Story Eq. Jur. Q 700 a, and
cases cited. But where the invalidity does not appear on its face, the jurisdiction

of equity to declare it cancelled is well settled.

§ 6 Cold. 319.

Chancery may afford relief where lands intended to be conveyed were omitted
to be conveyed by mistake. Frazier v. Tuhb, 2 Heisk 662. Equity will relieve
againat mistake, accident etc., but not against improvident contract. Bankhead
v. Alloway. 6 Cold. 75. It is well settled that mere inadequacy of consideration.
is not acause for which equity will set aside acontract. Wright v. Wilson,
§ 2 Yerg. 294. Unless the inadequacy is gross and shocking, such as amount to
proof of fraud. White v. Flora, 2 Tenn. 426, Cooper’s edition, and cases cited.
But in one case, where there was no fraud, but gross and shocking inadequacy
of consideration, the Supreme Court adjudged “ according to the very right of‘

the case,” and aﬁirmcd a decree granting relief.

Where the parties to an illegal & immoral contract are equally guilty, neither
can invoke the aid of equity to disturb it after it is executed; but where the
contract is executory, and the public interest is involved, it is in the discretion of
the courts to set it aside. Porter v. Jones, 6 Cold. 322, citing Smith's Leading
Cases, Vol. 1, part 1, p 638; Yerger v. Rains, 4‘llumph. 259; 1 Story’s Eq. Jur.,.

Wiﬂiams v. Tallisferro, 1 Cold. 38; Hale v. Sharp, 4 Cold. 275. Before chancery
will interfere with a judgment at law it must be made to appear

§ 1. That it was unjust.
§ 2. That complainant was prevented from making defence by fraud, accident,

or the act of complainant, and that he was chargeable with no negligence, Row
land v. Jones, 2 Heisk. 321; Hickerson v. Raynel, Ib., 829; Kenrny v. Smith, 2
Yerg. 127. A decree rendered in one chaucery district cannot be reversed or
pronounced a nullity by a chancellor in n different district. Smith v. Jonson, 2

Where the county court or circuit court has concurrent jurisdiction with the
chsncery court over any given subject, whichever court ﬁrst takes jurisdiction
ousts the others; and the others cannot abjudicate upnn the same subject matter.

§ 4983. The creditor, whose execution has been returned
unsatisﬁed in whole oi‘ in part, may ﬁle a bill in Chancery
against the defendant in the execution, and any other person
or corporation, to compel the discovery of any property, in
cluding stocks, choses in action, or money due to such defend
ant, or held in trust for him, except when the trust has been Exception.

created by, or the property so held has proceeded from some
person other than the defendant hiinself, and the trust is de
clared by will duly recorded, or deed duly registered. [Ib.]
Prior to the act of 1832, ch. 11, chancery had no power to subject the stock of
a debtor in a corporation fairly acquired and held, on the principle that neither a.
judgment nor a ﬁ. fa. fastened any lien upon the same, and that chaucery acted
only in aid of the remedy at law. Erwin v. Oldham, 6 Yerg. 185. But now the
stock in corporations is subject to execution like other personal property. See Q}
§ 1487, 3034.-For cases under the original act of 1832, see Gasget v. Scott, 9 Yerg,

§ 244; Hopkins v. Gnllatin Turnpike Co., 4 Humph. 403.

Upon a return of nulla

allegation of the insolvency of the defendant be suﬂicieut to give jurisdiction
without a return of nulla bona?—Eds.]
§ 4284. The court has power to compel the discovery, and

to prevent the transfer, payment, or delivery of the property,
and to subject the same to the satisfaction of the judgment

or decree, whether such property could, if in the defendant’s
possession, or with the title vested in him, be levied upon by

execution or not. [Ib., § 2.]
§ 4285. The court is empowered, also, to order all such

bonds and other instruments to be executed by either the»
complainant or defendant, and all such transfers to be made,
as may be necessary to carry the jurisdiction into complete
eifect. [Ib.]

§ 4286. The creditor has a lien upon the property from the
ﬁling of his bill, but he may acquire a lien from the rendition.
of the judgment or decree, by causing a memorandum thereof,
within sixty days from its rendition, tobe registered as pro

vided in sections 29S~t-2985, and by ﬁling his bill within
thirty days from the return of the execution unsatisﬁed.
[Ib., § 3.]
Note to Q 4283-4286.—The application of these provisions of the Code to in
solvent corporations, when construed in connection with other sections, is
certainly very indirect, if indeed they may be snid to have any application at all,
It is clear that under Q 4283, the creditor by judgment or decree may, after a retum
of execution unsatisﬁed in whole or in part, ﬁle his bill against the defendant in
the execution, and embrace in the bill any other person or cor
poration, secure his lien, and compel a discovery of any property, stocks,
choses in action belonging to, or money due to such defendant, or held in trust
for him; but it is not equally clear from the language of the statute that such

defendant may be an insolvent corporation, not using its franchises. The Legis

lature did not intend to break down all distinction in the view of a court of
equity, between an insolvent corporation not using its franchises, and a solvent
one, in the full exercise of all its powers and privileges. Construing the above
sections with sections 4294 and 4295, it is held that by the latter sections the»

Legislature did not intend merely to extend the remedy given by Q 4283
v

to creditors generally, but to create a separate and distinct remedy against cor
porations found in a given condition. It is hence held that a creditor cannot,

under Q 4283, by ﬁling a bill against aninsolvent corporation, not using its
franchises, acquire such a lien upon the assets of the corporation as will entitle
him to full satisfaction of his demand to the prejudice of other creditors; but
that the assets of such a corporation remain, as before the above statute, accord
ing to the general doctrine of equity, impressed with the character of apledge or
trust for the beneﬁt of all the creditors, and in which all are entitled to share
ratahly, notwithstanding the superior diligence of some. Marr v. Bank of West
Tennessee, 4 Cold. 471. By the Act of 1860, ch. 27, Q 30, this principle is so far

modiﬁed in regard to insolvent banking corporations. that bill-holders are to
have priority of satisfaction over other creditors. Ib., 486 ; @ 1829 b, sub-sec. 2'1,
and note.

§ 4Q87. In all cases where personal service of process can Toerty
without
udgmeut at
not be made at law, and where no original attachment at w.

law will lie, and no judgment at law can be obtained, and
also in cases where the demand is purely of an equitable

nature, the Court of Chancery has jurisdiction to subject
legal and equitable interests in every kind of property, witl1
the exception stated in section 4283, the lien to commence
from the ﬁling of the bill, if the facts are veriﬁed by aﬁidavit,
and injunction granted. [Ib., § 4.]
The history, policy and proper construction of this section of the Code are dis
cussed at length in Graham v. Merrill, 5 Cold. 622, 632-88, where Erwin v.
Oldham, 6 Yerg. 185; Ewing v. Cantrell, Meigs, 864, 378, and Gasget v. Scott,
§ 9 Yerg. 244, 250, are quoted.-The mere ground that the demand of the com
plainant is of an equitable nature is not of itself suflicient to warrant the im
pounding of the defendants property by attachment and injunction. 5 Cold.

§ 688.

But the court has power to grunt attachments and injunctions in regard

to properties, in the ordinary course of proceeding, when necessary or useful

to obtain or secure its jurisdiction; and the inadvertent grant of such process
by the court, does not make the process void, but it will be discharged on motion.

Ib., 631-638.

§ 4288. Any creditor, without ﬁrst having obtained a judg Fraudulent
ment at law, may ﬁle his bill in Chancery for himself, or for °°“°""°°"‘
himself and other creditors, to set aside fraudulent conveyances
of property, or other devices resorted to for the purpose of
hindering and delaying creditors, and subject the property,
by sale or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the debt.
[Act 1851-2, ch. 365, § 10, modiﬁed.]
See also Q 1759 ct seq.—Under this statute, 1851-2, ch. 865, Q 10, it is not
necessary for a creditor to come into chancery with a judgment at law, and

an execution with a return of nulla. bona. He is authorized to ﬁle a bill in all
cases where a conveyance has been made by a debtor of any properly, either
real, personal or mixed, of any description, to which the title is legal or equitable,
for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or defrauding his creditors. Wilson v.
Beadle, 2 Head, 510, 513. Statutes made to suppress fraud are to be liberally
expounded. Hence the word “ conveyance," in the above statute is to be taken in
an enlarged sense, and embraces assignments of claims, and every species
of chases in action. 2 Head, 518. The above section and Q 4286 are also
noticed in Harrison v. Hallum, 5 Cold. 525, when it is held that in order to

subject a legacy in the hands of executors—which is equitable personal assets,
_the bill must show either—
§ 1. Ajudgmcnt, execution and a nulla bona.
§ 2. Or one of the grounds on which an original attachment in Chancery may
issue, prescribed by the statute law.
§ 3. Or a conveyance or device, made as to the properties sought to be sudject

ed, to hinder and defraud creditors. Unless such a bill exhibits one of these
elements, it exhibits no ground of jurisdiction and will be dismissed on demur
rer.

§ 5 Cold. 528.

The intent of this and the two following sectionsis to give creditors at largo
the same remedies against fraudulent conveyances and decrees of their debtor,
as are had in Chancery, according to the course of the common law, by judg

ment creditors. The proper construction of these sections is, that the court has
the same power and jurisdiction in all respects, to set aside fraudulent convey
ances and other fraudulent devices, in the cases therein mentioned, and to sub
ject the properties, by sale or otherwise, to the payment of debts, as if the credi

tor had judgment, or judgment and execution, or judgment, execution and nulla
bona return. August v. Seeskind, 6 Cold. 166, 172. See also note to Q 4291.
Under § 8455, the seizure of the property is necessary to the jurisdiction of the‘
court; but under the above section it is different. The court obtains jurisdiction
of the person of the defendant by subpmna or publication, and the property may
be seized at the discretion of the court. Ib. The Clerk and Master cannot issue
attachment under these sections. The Chancellor alone ean; but the Clerk.

and Master can, under Q 3455.

[Act 1s01, ch. s,§ 2.]
The policy of the original act is discussed in Davis v. Fulton, 1 Tenn. 121, 184.
It conferred a new power upon our courts of equity to act in rem, where they"

could only act in personam before.

It gave the means of affording relief in n

case which, by general principles,would be proper, by authorizing the court to~
act in rem in relation to foreign contracts, when the debtor shall be insolvent.
§ 1 Tenn. 135. Previously, no remedy had been prescribed. It is essentially a

proceeding in 1-em : no personal notice is required and publication is snhstitned.
The statute can not be made to apply to any ease but the one provided for,.
being an encroachment upon the practice of courts of chancery, by giving them
jurisdiction to subject the estate of a defendant without perscnal notice, and
where he resides beyond the jurisdiction of the court. It confers new and
extraordinary powers. If a judgment is recovered by A against B, in a sister State,
and a ﬁeri facias returned thereon by the proper oﬁicer “ not satisﬁed," and the
defendant in the execution owns real or personal properity in this State,—upon
a bill being exhibited for that purpose, the court has power and authority to
render liable such property for the payment of the debt. But it is held that “ to the
defendant alone does the Act apply ,when he owns property in his own right, and
not as adoninistrater of another State,whc1-s a judyrnent has been there rrcovm-ed’

against him as such, to be levied of the goods in his hands unadmi.m'stercd.”'

material defendant is found, (Z2) unless otherwise prescribed
by law.
(a) It may act in 1-em in the case prescribed in § 4297. See note to that sec
tion.-See Grace v. Hunt, Cooke, 341, 343; Davis v. Fulton, 1 Tenn. 121, 138.

(b) This general rule, which embodies the language of the Act of 1809, ch. 12,
Q3, [see Q 2808,] was enunciated in the following cases: Childress v. Perkins,
Cooke, 87 ; Newnan v. Stuart, Cooke, 839 ; Parker v. Porter, 4 Yerg. 81 ; Cain Y.

Butler, 4 Hayw. 53, and Unniversity v. Cambreling, 6 Yerg. 79, 85. Hence, if
the defendant resides in a different county from the county in which the court is
situated and over which it has jurisdiction, and process is served upon him in
the county of his residence, the suit must abate. Cooke, 339-41 ; 4 Hayw. 63; 4
Yerg. 81-83. But if the defendant happens to be in the county from whence the
process issues, and process is served upon him there, the court acquires jurisdic
tion of his person, although his residence is in another county ; and the sheriﬁ"s

return is evidence of the fact that he is served with process in the county from
whence the process issued. Cooke, 87. In this case, as well as the other case in
Cooke, and the case in 4 Haywood, the rule was applied to injunction bills; but

this is now charged by staute, Q 4311, sub-sec. 8.

N ewnan v. Stuart, Cooke, 839, 841 ; University v. Cambreling, 6 Yerg. 79, 85.
Were this not the rule. justice would be defeated in most instances for want of
parties to a ﬁnal decree. 6 Yerg. 85. If a material defendant appears and de
fends by agreeing that the suit shall abide the event of another suit pending in the
same court, this is equal to service of subpmna within the jurisdiction, and gives

the court jurisdiction of all material parties, no matter in what part of the State
they reside. Ib.

§ 4307. In like manner, if the suit is properly instituted, ,l,\,3§1e<>.',1=¢\'
attachments, injunctions, and all other process known to the
court, and necessary to attain the ends of justice, may be

issued to any other county.

§ 4308. Any cause pending in the Chancery Court, may he 
transferred, by consent of parties, to the Chancery Court of
another district. [Act 1835, ch. 4, § 10.]
§ 4309. The jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in which ',{g;"',*},‘,f,{,',‘;',',~_
suit is brought, can only he resisted by plea in abatement,
demurrer, or motion to dismiss.
[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 16, modiﬁed.]
If the want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings, a motion to
dismiss will lie; and a failure to plead in abatement is not a waiver ofjurisdio
tion; for such a plea relates to matter not appearing in the bill, and could dis
close no additional fuct. Parker v. Porter, 4 Yerg. 81. But if the defendant
submits to answer the bill, he cannot afterwards except to the local jurisdiction.
Davis v. Fulton, 1 Tenn. 121, 137. And this was declared in the act of 1801,
ch. 6, Q 16. And where the defendant appears and agrees that the suit shall
abide the event of another suit pending in the same court, this is equivalent to a
service of subpoena within the jurisdiction. University v. Cambreling, 6 Yerg. '19,

§ 85. It seems that the provision of this section extends to objections to the
jurisdiction of the subject matter also; and this can be made by plea, [Q 4818,]
demurrer, [Q 4319,] or motion to dismiss. Greene v. Stames, 1 Heisk. 582,
§ 689-90; Bennett v. Wilkins, 5 Cold. 240-41. A bill totally wanting in equity
upon its face, which shows that the complainant is entitled to no relief, may be
dismissed on motion of the defendant, or by the chancellor of his own accord.
Earles v. Earles, 3 Head, 366.

§ 4310. The Court of Chancery has jurisdiction, in all cases Covenant
for the performance of covenants and collateral conditions
against the sureties in an obligation, when it has jurisdiction

against the principal.

[Act 1835, ch. 20, § 17.]

§ 4311. The local jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery is, 
also, subject to the following rules:
§ 1. The bill may be ﬁled in the chancery district in wliicl1w,,m,,,

the defendant or a material defendant resides; and if, upon ii§'.§§.iri'i'rt-§ius|.
inquiry at his residence, he is not to be found, he may be
proceeded against by publication or judicial attachment, as
herein provided. [Act 1787, ch. 22, § 1.]

§ 2. Bills seeking to divest or clear up the title to land, or to

°' "‘° 1"“ ""' enforce the speciﬁc execution of contracts relating to realty,
may be ﬁled in the district in which the land or any material

part of it lies.
[Act 1825, ch. 22; 1827, ch. 42; 1833, ch. 52.]
See as to local jurisdiction inpartition, QQ 3268, 3269.—If all the parties in
interest are before the court by personal service of process, and some of the
lands to be sold lie within the chancery district, the court has power to decree

the sale of those lauds lying in any other part of the State. Todd v. Camron, 8
Humph. 512.

tion has issued.

[Act 1825, ch. 22, § 2.]

This statute changes the rule declared in Childress v. Perkins, Cooke, 8'7;
Newnan v. Stuart, Cooke, 839, and Cain v. Butler, 4 Hayw. 53, so fer as regards

injunction bills. See note (b), to Q 4305.
Against non

§ 4. Bills against non-residents, or persons whose names or
residences are unknown, may be ﬁled in the district in which
the cause of action arose, or the act on which the suit is predicated
was to be performed, or in which the subject of the suit or
any material part thereof is. [Act 1827, ch. 42; 1833, ch. 52.]
Before the Act of 1827, as above, a bill would not be entertained by the courts
of equity ofthis State, ﬁled by a non-resident against a non-resident, upon a

contract entered into in another State. Avery v. Holland, 2 Tenn. 71, 76-9.

And

it was a. good plea in abatement to a bill in chancery, that the cause of action
did not originate within the State, and that the original process was not executed
upon the defendant personally; although the hill was to foreclose a mortgage
on land lying within the jurisdiction of the court. Grace v. Hunt, Cooke, 341.
Or although the contract concerned a locative interest in lands lying in this
State. 1 Tenn. '71. An exception to this rule was made by the Act of 1801,

ch. 6, Q 2, in favor of non-resident judgment creditors of non-resident insolvent
debtors. See § 4-297, and note.
Attachments.

§ 5. Whenever attachment of property is allowed in lien of
personal service of process, the bill may be ﬁled in the county
or district in which the property or any material part thereof
sought to be attached, is found at the commencement of the

suit.

Answer ﬁled as a cross bill, to become operative must be accompanied by a

title, the vendee may show any sufﬁcent defect. Ib. If an answer contains matter of
charge not contained in the bill, and discharge as to the same subject, complainant
must amend his bill and put the matter in issue, if he would avail himself of the

charge and disprove the discharge.

Neither is he required to deinnr , except for the No, ¢,,,,,,,_

want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter, or of the person,
but he may have all the beneﬁt ofa demurrer by relying there
on in his answer.
See Q 2934, and note; Q 4309.—A demurrer, general in its terms, after the form
of a general demurrer in the English Cliiiiicery Practice, not only does not raise
the question of jurisdiction, but under Q 2934, which applies to all courts, whether
of law or of equity, is a mere nullity. Kirkinan v. Snodgrass, 3 Head. 370. But
in a case where a cross-bill was dismissed on general demurrer, it was held no
error; for the bill was totally wanting in equity on its face, and might have been
dismissed on defenda.iit’s motion, or by the chancellor of his own accord. Eai-lea
v. Earles, 3 Head. 866. The lust clause of the above section does not refer to de
murrers for want ofjurisdiction.
The defendant cannot deniur to the jurisdic

is a waiver of objection to the jurisdiction. Bennett v. Wilkins, 5 Cold. 240.

are of legal cognizance.

[Act 1851-2,cl1. 365, § 9; 1s01, ch. 6, § 16.]
The same rule applies to objections to local jurisdiction, or jurisdiction over
the person. Q 4309. - If the parties proceed to a hearing on bill and answer,
or bill, answer and proof, this section would silence the defendant from insist
ing on n want of jurisdiction in the court, that objection being waived by re
lying on it in the answer; and this was all the legislation intended. Lowe V.
Morris, 4 Sneed, 69, 71. Hence, it is competent for the court at any time be
fore ﬁnal hearing, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to permit the answer
to be withrawn, and a plea to the jurisdiction to be ﬁled. Ib. And a pro con
feaao, being equivalent to an answer, is likewise a waiver‘ of the jurisdiction,
though the demand is purely a legal one. Wiley v. Bridgman, 1 Head, 68, 70.
Before the -passage of the above act, it was the settled rule that if a party neg
lected to make his defence at law, whether the defence was purely legal, or
from its nature both legal and equitable, and no obstacle in the way of such
defence existed in the legal forum, he could not afterwards avail himself of it
in a court of equity. Stockley v. Rowley, 8 Head, 493, 496, and other cases.
But this rule is so far changed by the above act that, at least in all cases not

unﬁtfor the 1'nvesh'_qa.lio1t of equity, if the defendant neglect to avail himself of
the objection to the jurisdiction, b_v demurrer, and answers to the merits of the
bill, the objection is waived, and cannot afterwards be insisted upon. 2 Head,
§ 496. And the answer is a waiver of objection to the jurisdiction, although it con
tains ademnrrer thereto. Bennett v. Wilkins, 5 Cold. 240; Lowrey v. Naif, 4

Cold. 370, 372.

See Q 4319, and note.

Hence, in a proceeding for partition, when

_the objection is not taken by demurrer, and the defendant answers, and the parties
carry the cause to a ﬁnal hearing upon the pleadings and proofs, the parties will
not be turned out of court to go through another process of litigation, because they
have attempted to clear the title and obtain partition in the same suit. Leverton

argument of s demurrer, the court, when the ground for demurrer canbe

expense of ﬁling a new bill, instead of deciding upon the demurrer, given
the plaintiff liberty to amend on payment of the costs incurred by the

Lion is made to this rule by the 5 Geo. II, ch. 22, which was substantially

followed by us in one act of 1787, ch. 22.

The Act of 1801, ch. 6, Q 2, [Q 4297];

§ 1825, ch. 22; 1833, ch. 47, and other acts followed, making exceptions to the
rule, and resulting in the above article of the Code. See Grace v. Hunt Cooke,
§ 841 ; also Mr. Heiskill's note, Dig., Q 566, sub-sec. 1. Where the order of

publication made by the clerk did not show at what time the defendant was
required to appear, but the dccree recited that it appeared that the publication
had been made according to the order heretofore made in this court, and no
order appeared to have been made in the court,—it was held, in an action of
ejectment, that in collateral proceedings the proper publication would be
presumed, in support of the proper action of the chancery court; although such
a decree, if appealed from, might, perhaps, be held erroneous and irregular. Kil
crease v. Blythe, 6 Humph. 378, 390. This was under the Act of 1757, which is
precisely similar to the Code in requiring a copy of the order to be published.
In one case it was objected thatit did not appear that the person who proved the
publication was a primer, or connected with any newspaper; and that the paper
to which the alﬂduvit proving publication was appended did not show that the
paper in which publication was made was a newspaper, or that it was published
after the order of publication was made; and that the order of publication did
not show that the paper in which the publication was to be made was a news
paper; and thatthe certiﬁcate of the clerk did not show that the paper signed by
the person proving the publication was sworn to by him ;—but these objections.
were held to be highly technical, and without substantial merit. Claybrooke v.
Wade, 7 Cold.‘ 565, 659. The court said they would presume that the Memphis
A;-_qu.g, the paper in which publication was made, was a “ newspaper," within the
meaning of the statute; and that it must also be presumed that the publication
was subsequent to, and in pursuance of the order. Ib. Wliilst the above section
of the Code provides that the fact of publication may be proved in a certain
manner, it by no means restricts, but in fact enlarges, the means of establishing
the fact of publication; and that fact may be established by any other competent
evidence. Ib., 560. Besides. this court has repeatedly holden, that where it is
recited in the decree of the court below, that notice has bben duly given by
publication, etc., this court will presume that the fact is as recited in the decree.
Presnmptions of this character are necessary to uphold the proceedings of the.
judicial tribunals of the country. Ih.—But where there was a positive charge that

the sale was made without any publication, and the commissioner to make the sale

prayed for in the bill, who was principal defendant to a bill to set aside the
sale, answered that he had no recollection of any publication, but supposed he
made it, because it was his duty to do so, and no order or proof of publication
appeared in the record,—this was held evidence that there had been no publica
tion. Rucker'v. Moore, 1 Heisk. 726. In case of the death of a non-resident
defendant before answer, his death is to be suggested of record, and proved, and
a bill is to be ﬁled, and proeesss issued thereon, to which his representatives may

make such answer as the nature of the case may require.

When a person has

died before answer, leaving an infant representative, it seems necessary that a
Iubpmna. accompanied by a copy of the bill should issue, as is usual in practice.
Upon return of its execution, if no person shall apply to be appointed guardian,
the court will appoint one, who shall have until the next term to hnswer, being

the time allowed by acts of assembly to defendants in ordinary cases [QQ 2827,
§ 2828]. After answer ﬁled by the guardian, the cause will proceed. Lewis v.
Outlaw, 1 Tenn. 139, 142. If the defendant die after answer, and his children
being necessary parties, are infants, the same course will be pursued, except that
the guardian will take up the defense where the defendant lel't it. Ib. See also
§ 4360. If the defendant, upon whom process has been ser

ved, fails to appear and defend in the time required by law,
the bill may be taken for confessed, or the complainant may
proceed by process of contempt to compel an answer.

diction by proceedings for contempt, see Q H06 at seq.—As to the mode of pro‘
ceeding when the contempt is for the breach of an injunction, see Rutherford
v. Metcalf, 5 Hayw. l58.—As to execution by attachment of the person, see H 3104,

Q 2, sub-sec, 2; Q 4110. If the penalty of the bond is not ﬁxed by the court, it
is ﬁfty dollars, Q 4111. But where the attachment is against a witness, the clerk
and master ﬁxes the amount of bail. Rule VII, 1 2, sub-sec. 6, Appendix.

§ 4363. If the defendant fails to appear in compliance with
the terms of his bail, a second attachment issues, upon which
no bail can be taken; and the penalty of the bail-bond may be
decreed forfeited and collected by execution. [Ib, § 19.]
See also Rule VII, App., § 2, sub-sec. 4.

§ 4364. If the defendant appears, and refuses to answer fully,
he shall be committed to jail, there to remain until he purges

the clerk and master, and the defendant or his solicitor notiﬁed W WW"
thcreof. and ordered to answer, the defendant fails to ﬁle a

suﬁicient answer within thirty days, or to appeal from the
order of the master. [Act 1851-2, ch. 365, § 5.]
The practice of treating the defendant's neglect or refusal to put in an answer
as an admission of the truth of the allegations of the bill, seems not to have been

of very ancient standing in the English court of chsncery.

The course formerly

was, to put the complainant to make proof of the substance of the bill.

But the

practice more recently established was to take the bill pro confesso.

Before

doing so, however, the complainant was required to resort to all the process of
the court, in order to compel the defendant to answer. Lanum v. Steel, 10 Humph.
§ 280; citing 1 Dan. Ch. Pr. 567, 570, 573. The practice of taking bills for eon
fessed is said to be of such serious consequence to the rights of the parties, that
it is both proper and necessary that it should be strictly conﬁned within the
limits prescribed by the statute and rules of the court. 10 Humph. 282. Accord
ing to our practice, orders for taking hills pro confesso, and setting down causes
for hearing, properly appertain to the duties and functions of the clerk and
master, and not of the chancellor; and should be made at the rules, and not in
court. Ib. [This case held that a pro confcaso taken on any day of the term
other than the ﬁrst day, which by the then law was the rule day, should be set
aside aserroneous; but now by Q 4421, each day of the term is a rule day.-—Eds.]

But orders taking bills for confessed are in the discretion of the Court. and
will not be reversed except for manifest injustice. Buchanan v. Mcllanus, 8
Humph. 449.

§ 4371. Whenever an order pro confesso is lawfully had, the
allegations-in the bill are to be taken as admitted, except in
the case of infant defendants, persons of unsound mind,
executors, or administrators, bills for divorce, and bills, with
out attachment of property, against non-residents, and persons
whose names or residences are unknown.

[Ib., § 3 ; 1801, ch. 6, § 15.]
§ 4472. In the excepted cases of infants and persons of un
sound mind, the defendant shall appear by guardian or com
mittee before the complainant can proceed with his cause.
In Kilcrease v. Blythe, 6 Humph. 378, 390, a decree against infants on publica
tion withont appearance was held good.-1n altachment cases, persons laboring un
der the disability of infancy, coveture or unsoundness of mind have six months
after the removal of the disability to show cause against the judgment or decree.
§ 3532. And this applies to cases in chancery brought by attachmept. Q 4378.

Taken on publication.—Tliere is no difference between the effect of a pro con
fesso taken on apublication, and one based upon personal service.
Wade, 7 Cold. 555-60-1.

Claybrooke v.

Eject of pro confesso.--A bill taken for confessed is viewed as true in rela
tion to matters of fact. Jackson v. Honeycut, 1 Tenn. 30; Douglass v. Evans, 1
Tenn. 82; Keou v. White, Meigs, 858; Stone v. Duncan, 1 Head. 103.
But this principle does not apply to divorce macs ,- for, although the bill
"may be taken for confessed as in other cases,” Q2454: yet the complainant
must make out his case by aﬂirmative proof; and, when the divorce is sought on
the ground of adultery, show negatively that none of the statutory defences
If the bill shows that the complainant is not entitled to

the relief he seeks, judgment pro confa-1-to will avail nothing.

Ross v. Ramsey, 3

Head, 15. An agreement to take an account as ifanswer ﬁled, the pro confeaao
-to stand, lets in an attack upon the whole equity of the bill. Pearl v. Nashville,
Meigs. 597, 603.

Bill against two, answer by <me.—If the bill is against two defendants, and
-one answers, an-l disproves the compl:iina.nt’s whole case, it will be dismissed as
to both. Pettey v. Hannum, 2 Humph. l02, 105; Hennessee v. Ford, 8 Humph.
§ 499 ; 10 Johns. 525; McDaniel v. Goodall, 2 Cold. 391 ; Claybroolte v. Wade, 7
Cold. 555. 560; Warren v. Kennedy, 1 Heisk. 437, 439. And the effect ofa
judgment by default at law is the same. 1 Heisk. 439; Q 2961, and note. But
this rule does not apply where the defendants’ rights are distinct. Philips v.
Hollister, 2 Cold. 269. And see Stone v. Duncan, 1 Head, 103. If s bill be taken
for confessed against a married woman, and her trustee- comes in and
answers, his defense will be asuﬁicient to protect her rights. Cherry v. Clements,
§ 10 Humph. 652, 554. So, the answer ofa vendor will protect the rights of his
vendee against apro confesao. 8 Humph. 499. But a pro confesao against com
plainant's vendor, is, as to facts involving the validity of cOmpla.inHnt's purchase,
-conclusive against a defendant who sold to such vendor. Keon v. White, Meigs,
§ 858, 86!. A decree rendered against some of the defendants, without taking
judgment pro crnvfes-so is of no more force than if no step had been taken to
make them parties. Wright v. Wilson, 2 Yerg. 294.

Upon answer adjudgrd insziﬂicient.--Where a bill was taken for confessed upon
an answer adjudged insufficient, the rule formerly was that it was treated as if
no answer had been ﬁled. Lea v. Vanbibber, 6 Humph. 18, 20; Lannm v. Steele
§ 10 Humph. 280, 283. But now see Q 4407.

from the Chancellor, or clerk and master, an order setting aside
the decree pro confesso, upon ﬁling a. full and suﬁicient answer
and the payment of costs.

[Act 1801, ch. 6, §15, Proviso.]

A defendant seeking to have apro confeaso set aside must not only show a
“good cause," but this good cause ought to be so indicated that the court may be
able to determine what it really is. Wilson v. Waters, 7 Cold. 328, 828.

A decree pro confesso will not be set aside when the answer tendered contain
no matter )f defence suiﬂcient to enable the defendant to resist the relief sought
by the bill. Lewis v. Simonton, B Humph. 183. A judgment pro confesso
ought not to be set aside, as a general rule, after the witnesses are dead ; but
there may be exceptions justifying it. Buchanan v. Mchianus, 3 Humph. 449. Set
ting aside judgments pro confesso, on cause shown is a matter conﬁded to the

discretion of the chancellor; and as in case of other orders preparatory to the trial
of causes, his action can seldom be revised by a court of errors. Ib. Receiving
counter aﬂidavits on a motion to set aside a judgment pro confeuo is a practice of
doubtful and dangerous tendency, and not to be encouraged. lb.
“By the Code, Q 4875, it would seem doubtful whether the answer and payment

of costs are conditions precedent, or whether the order may be made to take ef
fect infuturc, on the condition being complied with.” Heisk. Dig., p. 569. See
for the practice under the original act, Scales v. Scales, 8 Hayw. 229. If a pro
confeaso is set aside with leave to answer, the defendant is precluded from any
other mode of defense, and cannot plead or demur without special leave. Allen r.

jurisdiction shall afterwards be allowed.
[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 16.]
This rule applies to objections to the jurisdiction orer the subject mat
ter. Q 4321, and note. So the falsity or non existence of the causestated
as the ground for attachment in equity is matter in abatement, and is not
available after answering to the merits, though denied and not proved.
Hendrick v. Davis, 8’Co1d. 624, 527; Foster v. Hall, 4 Humph. 346;
Isaaclts v. Edwards,7 Humph. 465, 467. If aplea in abatement to an at

Jtotton to
dismiss.

§ 4386. A bill may be dismissed, on motion of the de
fendant—
§ 1. For want of equity on its face. (a)
§ 2. Because unknown to the forms of the court. (6)
' 3. If it appear on the face of the bill, that the courthas
no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. (c)
§ 4. For want of any of the prerequisites to the issuance of

the writ.
§ 5. For misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties, where the fact
appears on the face of the bill. (e)
§ 6. For mnltifarionsness.
§ 7. For such other grounds as may be specially declared
suﬁicient by this Code.
(a) A bill totally wanting in equity upon its face, or which shows that the com
plainant is entitled to no relief, may be dismissed upon motion of the de
fendant, or by the chancellor of his own accord. Such a bill requires no
answer, and its disniissal can do no injury to the complainant. Earles v.

Earles, 3 Head, 366. If from the face of the bill, it appears that the court
has no jurisdiction of the cnse, or if it contain no matter of equity what»
ever, the chancellor may properly dismiss the bill on mere motion, at the
appearance tcrm or at any subsequent stage of the cause.

But not so, when

a case proper l'0r equitable relief is dejcctively stated in the bill.

Thompson v.

Paul, 8 Humph. 114, 117. In one case it is held, the chancellor cannot, in
the exercise of his ordinary powers as such, dismiss a bill, until it comes
regularly before him for adjudication, or until it is at issue. Parks v. Jones,
§ 2 Cold. 172, 174. But in hhyse v. Biggs,3 Head, 36,a bill was dismissed
for want of equity on the hearing of a motion to dissolve an injunction.

(b.) If abill is known to the forms of the court, it must be open to plea
or demurrer; if not, it may be taken oﬂ‘ the ﬁles as a novelty. Cox v. Breed
love, 2 Yerg. 499, ﬁll; citing Perry v. Phillips, 1'1 Ves. 184. If a demurrer
is ﬁled, it admits the jurisdiction of the court, and the bill must he ex
amined to see if there is any equity: but if the court has no jurisdiction
of any such matter; if the hill cannot be received and acted upon; if it
is not known to the forms of the c0urt;—it may be taken off the ﬁles
summarily by motion, and process which has emanated from it must be

quashed. 2 Yerg. 500, 611.
(c.) As in Parker v. Porter, 4 Yerg. 81,88.
(d.) As where an attachment bill is with a bond omitting the clause of
indemnity for wrongfully suing out the attachment.
patrick, 4 Humph. 311.

Bank of Ala. v.Fit:

(0.) If there bea misjoinder of parties or causes of action, the chancellor
may dismiss the bill as to one set of parties, or as to one cause of action,
and retain it as to the other. Johnson v. Brown, 2 Humph. 327, 880.
( j'.) As to multifariousness, see the cases collected in Heiskell’s Digest, p. 540
-at seq.; Harrison v. Hallnm,5 Cold. 625. See also @482-'i,et seq.
(_q.) A motion lies to comwl a party who is prosecuting at law the sumo
'csu=e- for which he is proceeding in equity, to elect in which court he will
.~proceed. Cooke v. Dotson, 1 Tenn. 169. So, if pending a rule fora new
trial in ejectment, the defendant ﬁlea hill for the same matter, he must
elect, and if he proceeds in equity, the rule for new trial will be discharg

-ed.

§ 4387. The power of the court to allow amendments, and Am==¢1=¢I*

to permit the complainant to supply defects and omissions is not
aﬂ"ected by any thing contained in the foregoing section.
Amendments in chancery proceedings are allowed, with great liberality. Cocks
v.Evans, 9 Yerg. 287, 294 ;Hackney v. Hackney, 8 Humph, 450. Especially in di

vorce cases. 8 Humph. 450. But an exception to this rule exists in cases of answers
upon oath, which, for obvious reasons will not easly be changed. 9 Yerg. 294. But
after the examination of witnesses and publication passed, no part of the pleadings,
can be altered or added to, but under very special circumstances, or in consequence
of some subsequent event. 9 Yerg. 295'; citing Mitt‘. Pl., 259. ‘Hans, after testimony
taken and closed and an interlocutory decree deciding upon the merits, and account.
ordered, to enable the court to make aﬂnal settlement, an amendment of the answer
to permit the defendant to plead the statute of limitations, ought not to be al

lowed. 9 Yerg. 295. Au answer ought not to be amended so as to draw in new is
sues, and a new hearing upon them, after a former hearing, when the testimony is
closed and new depositions might become necessary. Flora v. Rogers, 4 Hayw. 202.
Nor to add a defense really omitted by mistake, alter depositions taken, and pre
parations made for the hearing, so as to make a new examination and preparation
necessary, if the defense can be brought forward by cross—bill or otherwise,
unless it be to prevent a criminal prosecution. Ib. lf the same matter be put in the
answer to an amendment, which has already been disposed of in the former bill, or
which is impertinentto the matters alleged in the amendment, the complainant may
except to such matter, and have it stricken out. Ib. When an amendment is made
to the bill, after answer ﬁled,}the defendant has thirty days in which to answer the
amendment. Q 4336.

' Demurrers are for substance or for form.
Substance. 1. That plantiﬁ has no interest in the subject.

§ 3. That the defendant has no interest.

§ 4. That the plaintilf is not entitled to the relief.prayed for.
§ 5. That the value of the subject matter is beneath the dignity of the Court.
§ 6. That the bill does not embrace the whole matter.
§ 7. Want of proper parties, or misjoinder of parties.
§ 8. Multifariousness or confounding distinct demands.

§ 9. That the remedy is barred by the statute of limitations.
§ 10. Another suit pending for the same cause.

The court has discretion to permit a defendant to withdraw an answer and ﬁle
a demurrer. Lowe v. Morris, 4Sneed, 69.

Plea of innocent purchaaer.—If complainant ' has a right to relief, yet the defend

§ 4389. To procure prompt dispatch of the business of the 3.", amt.
court, the defendant may make a rule, in the clerk’s oiﬁce, on mp mm“
his adversary to take any step necessary to the progress of the
cause, and the clerk shall give notice of this rule immedi
ately to the party interested, or his counsel.
§ 4390. If the party upon whom such rule is made, fail tomlm ‘O um
vtake the necessary step, the Chancellor, at the next term, unless "BP
good cause be shown for the failure, shall make a peremptory
rule, ﬁxing the time within which the step shall be taken, and
if not so taken, the cause shall be dismissed.

§ 439l. No step taken by the defendant shall prevent him »m,,,n,,,,,_
from moving to dismiss for the default of the complainant. mum’
§ 4392. The court may, however, upon good cause shown by Cﬁlllilftlllllkfom
aﬁidavit, relieve the complainant from the consequences of his Mult
default, imposing such terms to hasten the hearing of the
cause, as, in its discretion, may be thought just.

The above four sections supersede the Act of 1801, ch. 6, Q 29, and Rule 29,
Car. 8: Nich. p. 744.
Under the above three sections a rule will be made—
§ 1. Where complainant fails to reply to a plea, or set it for argument.
§ 2. Where leave is obtained to amend a bill, and complainant fails to do it.
§ 8. Where some of the parties are dead, and no action is taken.
§ 4. Where a fame sole is a party, and marries, and no step is taken to revive.
§ 6. Where a suit is pending both in law and equity, a rule will be made ro
quiring complainant to elect in which court he will proceed.
§ 6. Where a plea of bankruptcy is sustained, and the assignee fails to make
himself a party, Hicks Ch. Pr., p. 126. Filing an amended bill postpones the
time for ﬁling answers to the original bill until the time for ﬁling answers to

the amended bill.

Graham v. Cook, 6 Yerg. 404.

§ 4393. If the plaintiff conceives any plea or demurrer to be Plea or de
naught, either for the matter or manner of it, he may set it {,'1,“,",'?‘}.§‘,3"
down with the clerk to be argued; or, if he thinks the plea mm"
good but not true, he may take issue upon it, and proceed to {,',f:f“P°“
trial. If the plea be found false, the complainant shall have

the same advantages as if it had been so found by verdict at
common law.

[Act 1801, ch. 26.]

Where an answer is ﬁled in support of a plea, if there is doubt of its sufﬁciency,
it should be set down for argument, and not excepted to; for an exception
allows the plea just as a replication would. Hicks Ch. Pr., 100. If a defendant
admits a verbal agreement, invalid under the statute of frauds, but does not insist
on the statute, the Court will decree speciﬁc performance. Sneed v. Bradley, 4
Sneed, 801. If there is a charge of fraud or other circumstances in a bill to avoid
I bar of the action, a plea must deny the fraud or other circumstance and
mustbe supported by an answer. Graham v. Nelson, 5 Humph. 605; Hicks Ch.
Pr., p. 105-7; Williams v. Caplinger, 6 Humph. 257. Sections 2901, at seq. apply
to chsncery proceedings. Kendrick v. Davis, 8'Cold. 624. Where a plea required
to be under oath is not sworn to, it should not be noticed, Graham v. Nelson, 5

Humph. 609.
In all eases where it would be necessary to establish the truth of a plea, upon
oath, at the hearing, it should when ﬁled, be sworn to by the defendant. Danl. Ch.

Pr., 786, at seq. Notwithstanding the oath is waived in the bill. Hearty. Corning,
§ 3 Paige, 566. And in all eases whore a plea should be supported by answer.
Danl. Ch. Pr., 790. Where a plea ought, on motion, to be struck from the
ﬁles for some defect or irregularity, as if it be not sworn to, setting it down for
argument is not a waiver of the objection, but a mode of obtaining the judgment of
the court on its validity as a plea. 6 Humph. 609.

§ 4394. A demurrer or a plea shall be set for argument at

§ 4395. Upon a plea or demurrer argued and overruled, no
other plea or demurrer shall be received, but the defendant
shall answer the allegations of a bill; and, in case he fails to
do so by the next rule day, or by the time prescribed by the
court, the bill may be taken for confessed, or answer enforced
by contempt, as if no such plea or demurrer had been ﬁled.

See Gsnt v. Gant, 10 Humph. 464, and citations.—Th¢ clerk hns no authority
to discharge the contempt, or to recieve the answer: and if an answer is trans
mitted to the clerk and placed on ﬁle by him while the defendant is in contempt,
the complainant may treat it as a nullity; and if this is done, it is error in the

chancellor to dismiss for want of prosecution until the contempt is cleared. 10

or Justice presides. The oath may also be administered, in
another State, by a commissioner of this State, appointed by
the Governor, or by a notary public, whose attestation shall

the complainant may take his bill for confessed as to the part
to which his exceptions relate, and proceed with the cause as
in other cases. [Act 1851-2, ch. 365, §§ 5, 15.]
If the defendant make a full and perfect answer, and upon exceptions thereto,

the chancellor adjudge it insnﬂicient, and proceed to decree

§ 4408. When the defendant resorts to a cross-bill, he shall
ﬁrst answer the original bill, before he can require the com
plainant therein to answer his bill. [Act 1801, ch. 6, §38.]
But if an amended bill is ﬁled after a cross-bill, the cross-bill must be an
swerd ﬁrst. Scales v. Nichols, 3 Hayw. 229, 231; citing 2 Atk. 218, 219.—A
cross-bill incorporates itself with the original bill and must be heard with it
When, therefore, the compliiinsints in it cross-bill set it down for hearing, they do
an act, the legal effect of which is, perhaps, to set down the principal cause also.
Cooke v. Trotter, 10 Yerg. 213-14. So. an appeal from a decree on a cross-bill

opens the cause on the original bill.

Woodrum v. Kirkpatrick, 2 Swan, 218.

Wliere a cause was of eleven years standing, and a reference of account had been
made to the Master but iio account taken, it was held that leave would not be
granted to ﬁle a cross-bill, unless the matter of it was material, or unless the
beneﬁt of it could not be had in any other way,-as by proof, or the examination
of the party upon interrogatories. If allowed at so late a period, it should be on
condition that the hearing on the original bill should proceed, as if the cross-bill

it is not error to read it, although it was taken after the commencement of the
term at which an order previously made for taking it had expired. Richmond

upon good cause shown by aﬂidavit, directing the arrest of a defendant and
detention until he give bond conditioned not to remove himself or the property in
controversy beyond the limits of the State, so as to defeat the decree which
might be given in the cause. Smith v. Koontz, 4 Hayw. 189. In a later case it
was held that the chancery court has no power independently of statutory enact
ment, to impound the property of a defendant at law to secure the payment of
adebt. Union Batik v. Newman, 4 Humph. 380. The new Constitution, Art.
I, Q l8, prohibits the legislature from passing any law authorizing imprisonment
for dcbt in civil eases. And in the case above quoted from 4th Haywood,Cooper‘s

Injunctions in this State are not otherwise issued than on the ex part: state

ment, made on oath, of him who obtained it.

Rutherford v. Metcall, 5 Hayw.

§ 58, 64. By the English practice, in ordinary cases, an injunction is not obtained
until the answer comes in. Not so with us. The injunction here issues with
the subpaana generally, though it may be moved for as in England. There, if an
answer admits or evades the equitable charges of the bill,the court will grant an in
junction. Our courts seem to act on the same principle in dissolving, that the
English courts do in allowing an injunction. Haynes v. Ilazlerigg, 1 Tenn. 242.
Injunctions may be granted, quia ti/net, either before or after suit at law. If
after suit and before plea, the suit at law may proceed to issue and stop there.
If after issue, it proceeds tojudgment, and there stops until the lleterminatior
of the suit in equity. Hendricks v. Dallum, 1 Tcnn. 427.
Disobedience o_f.—It is contempt of court to disobey an injunction. Ruther
fold v. Metcalf, 5 Hayw. 58. Even though it was inadvertently granted. Gra
ham v. Merrill, I5 Cold. 638. Any person who acts in deﬁance of an injunction is
liable for the injury done innocent persons, and the injunction is effective from
the time defendant knows of its existence. Farnswortl: v. Fowler, 1 Swan 1 ; Boils
v. Boils, 1 Cold. 284. A sale of property under an execution in disregard of an in
junction, rendcrs the oﬁicer liable for its value. Stinson v. McMurray, 6 Humph.

v A party in contempt for violating an injunction will not be heard in tho cause,
until he yields obedience. Rutherford v. Metcalf, 5 Hayw. 68. And see Q 4396
and note. And see further, the cases collected under the head of “ efect of in
junctions," in Ileiskells Digest, pp. 608, 609. An inadvertent grant ol" an injunc

If an injunction is dissolved, it may be granted again upon a supplemental bill
showing new facts. Fanning v. Dunham, 4 John. Ch. R. 35-57. But not if the

to open the package. [Act 1825, ch. 71, § 3.]
§ 4439. Before issuing the writ of injunction, the clerk and
master shall take from the complainant, besides the usual bond
for the prosecution of the suit, a bond conditioned, according to

to the object of the bill, as follows:

‘D0 enjoin suit
It law before
judgment

§ 1. Wlieii a judgment at law has been obtained, the condi
tion of the bond shall be to pay the amount of the judgment
atlaw, with interest, damages, and costs, or to perform the
decree of the court, in case the injunction is dissolved, and also
to pay such damages as may be sustained by the wrongful
suing out of the attachment [Injunctioni]
§ 2. When before judgment at law, the investigation of the
questions involved has been drawn by injunction into the
Court of Chancery, upon the ground of a concurrent jurisdic

tion in that court, the condition of the bond shall be to pay
costs and damages awarded by the Chancery Court on dis
missing the bill.
This sub-section embodies the doctrine of Black v. Caruthers, 6 Humph. 87,
§ 90, where the pature of injunction bonds under our practice is stated.—By our
practice the taking of a bond before the issuance of an injunction is substituted

for the deposit of money with the clerk and master, according to.the practice in
England. Conway v. Jett, 8 Yerg. 481, 484; 6 Humph. 90. Where a judgment
at law has been obtained, and the object of the suit in chancery is to abate the
amount of it, or to set it aside upon some equitable ground,—it has been usual to
give the bond l'or the amount of the judgment, conditioned for its payinent in the
event of failure in chancery. But where before judgment at law, the investiga
tion of the questions involved, has been drawn by injunction into the court of
chancery, upon the ground of a concurrent jurisdiction in that court, better
adapted to the merits of the controversy, it hns been more usual, as it certainly

is more proper, Ihat the condition of the bond should stipulate for the payment
in case offailure in the rhancery suit, of co-it-v and damages only. 6 Humph. 90,
§ 91. This case also holds, that in the abxence of legislation and arijudimtion, I

bond conditioned, in case of failure to prosecute the bill with effect, to pay Ill
costs, charges and damages, and to stand to, abide by and perform the decree of
the chancery court, would be regarded as taken within the competency of the

judge to order it, and the clerk to take it. But now the above sub-section sup
plies the “legislation" in the absence of which this ruling was mnde, and renders
the ruling obsolete.--It was also held in Newell v. Porter, decided before the
Code, that the Chancellor has s discretionary power as to the condition of the
bond. 10 Humph. 325, 827. Thus, where the bond was conditioned to pay all
costs and damages that might result to the defendant from the injunction, if the
suit was not successfully prosecuted, it was held good. 10 Humph. 825. The
taking of an injunction bond by s clerk and master is a judicial act. Ward v.
Cullom, 2 Cold. 353, 364. Therefore whenever s clerk and master accepts such a
bond, the proof to overturn his action by showing that the signatures of any of
the parties were put there as an escrow should be as clear, satisfactory and de
monstrative as that required to set aside the decree or judgment of a court of re
cord on the ground of fraud. Ib. It is not essential to the validity of an injurie
tion bond, for it to have been delivered to the clerk at his oﬂice, or for all the
signers to have been present at its delivery, or for them to have acknowledged it
before him at any time. Ib., 362.
As to suits under the pauper oath, see Q 8192, and note.
Although o_1/er cnnnotbe demanded ofs record in general, yet an injunction bond

taken in an equity case belongs to the obligee named in it, and may be demanded
by him to be proceeded in any other court. Nichol v. White, 4 Huyw. 257.
see Q 2893, and note.

And

Besides the bond reqnired_by law, the Chancellor shall, when any money is
-

admitted lo be due, direct its payment into court, or require the complainant to
perform his ﬁat as to any part of the mutter sought to be enjoined, as to which
the complainant fails to allege sufﬁcient equity. See Rule VI, § 4, Appendix.

§ 4440. The penalty of the bond shall be as follows :
I‘
nal
f
bgndfyo
If the object is to enjoin a money demand after judgment,
in double thejudgment or sum sought to be enjoined.
In allother cases in such sum as the court shall order.
In the absence of any order, in the sum of ﬁve hundred
dollars.
§ 4441. Whenever the security is to be taken in any other c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,m,
county than that in which the court is held, the_ clerk and 
master may appoint a commissioner in the county where
security is to be taken, to judge of the suﬂiciency of the bond
and security, and to take the same as he himself might do.
[Act 1835, ch. 41, § 9.]
§ 4442. The damages may be ascertained by the court in gasps on
which the cause is heard, and injunction dissolved, upon refer'
ence to the clerk and master, and proof, or upon an issue of fact,
to be made up and tried as in other cases of issues of fact, if the
parties elect to have a jury. [Act 1845-6, ch. l22, § 3.]
§ 4443. If the defendant evade, or attempt to evade the ,,,,.,,c,,,,

service of the injunction, it shall be the duty of the oﬁicer to W'“'°“°“‘
leave a copy at the det'endant.’s residence, and state the facts in
his return, which shall be deemed a suﬂicient service.

§ 4444. A defendant may move to dissolve or modify an
injunction in vacation, before the Chancellor of the division in
which the bill is ﬁled, either for want of equity in the bill or,
upon the coming in of the answer, to be heard upon certiﬁed

copies of the bill, or bill and answer; but ﬁve days’ notice of
such application shall be given to the pla.intiﬁ'or his solicitor.
“In vacation."-— According to an old case, the motion, to dissolve {fin court,
is made without notice.

Rentfroe v. Dickinson, 1 Tenn. I96.

But the old

Chancery Rule, No. VII. Code of 1858, p. 980, prescribed “ at least one day’s
notice by motion in open court, or ﬁve days’ notice in writing, unless the motion
is based upon the defendant's answer, in which case three days must elapse after
the ﬁling of the answer, unless the chancellor shall order otherwise. The only pro
vision as to notice in the new rules, seems to that in rule VI, Q 2, which provides
that the notice shall state upon what the motion isbnsed, whether for want of
equity on the face of the bill, or upon bill and answer. There being nothing in
the new rules repugnant to the old rule, the old rule is probably still in force.
Atany time.

§ 4445. A motion to dissolve an injunction may be made at
any time upon answer, or tor want of equity on the face of the

bill.
It was the old practice not to hear a motion to dissolve an injunction, until
the return of the subpmna. Barton v. Lytle, Cooke; 89. Except in cases of for
eign or non-resident defendants; and this was put upon the ground that injus
tice might in such cases arise upon frivolous bills before the coming in of the
answer, when it appeared from the face of the bill that a decree could not be
ultimately made. 1 Tenn. 197. The theory of this distinction was that until the
coming in of the answer a resident defendant is in contempt, and that n defendant
will not be heard to move for the dissolution of an injunction while in contempt.
But in cases of non-residents, contnmely was not presumed. Ib. In England
the rule is said to be that there must be notice of a motion to dissolve, and
that the motion will in no ease be entertained while the defendant is in contempt
for not answering. Ib. But in England in ordinary cases an injunction is not
obtained until an answer comes in. Not so with us: the injunction issues with
the aubpwna, generally, although it may be moved for as in England. There if an
answer admits or evades the equitable clnirges of a bill, the court will grant an in
junction. Our courts seem to act on the same principle in dissolving, that the,
English Courts do in granting, an injunction. Haynes v. Hazlerigg, 1 Tenn. 242.
If the bill discloses sufﬁcient equity as to a part of the sum the recovery ofwhich
is enjoined, but that part is les-1 than ﬁfty dollars, the minimum jurisdiction of
the court, the injunction will be dissolved. I Tenn. 196. And see M 4280
§ 4281.

§ 4446. If there are exceptions to the suiﬁciency of the an
‘When excep
tions to an

~lwer.

swer, a motion to dissolve injunction upon the answer shall
not be entertained until the exceptions are disposed of, unless
the court should be of opinion that the matters of exception
would not affect the motion.
The above three sections are amended by QQ 4416 a, 4416 b.
Appeal; Supmiedeas; Certio1'a1-1'.-It would seem that an appeal does not lie
in the discretion of the Chancellor, under Q 3157, from an iriterloczttory order dis
solving an injunction. For it was held in one case that that section does not
authorize an appeal from an order refusing a motiento dismiss for wantef

Creiishavv v. Watson, Jackson, 1887, cited in

Heisk. Dig.. p. 592. And in another case, that it does not authorize an appeal
from an order discharging an auxiliary attucliuieiit. Jacobi v. Schloss, 7 Cold.
§ 785, 788. Nor can the Supreme Court, under H 3933, 3934, supersede an inter

locutory order or decree dissolving an injunction.

See note to Q 3933.

Where

an iiijiiiiction has been dissolved by interlocutory decree, an appenl from the

ﬁnal decree does not restore it, and the Supreme Court cannot in such ruse re
store it ; but an appeal from aﬂmal decree dissolving an injunction continues the
iiiijunction in force to the court above. Kearney v. JlL‘l(.s‘0ll,l Yerg. 294. In
such It case, if an appeal has been prayed and granted, but omitted to be entered
by the clerk. the Supreme Court will remove the cause/from below by crrtiorari

and superudeaa.

Ib. And see § M84, note (c)

-ceedings on ajiidginent for money, in whole or in part, the

[Act 1819, Cll. 119, § 1.]
See also Q} 4442, 4449, 4450.—'l‘he original Act provided, that “ when any in
ijunction shall be obtained to stay the collection of money on a judgment in any
of the CO\ll".5 of this State, and the same shall he dissolved on motion, or on ﬁnal

hearing of the cause. it -vha.//.120 the duly of the clerk of the court, in which the said
injunction shiill be dissolved or ﬁnal decree rendered, to enter upjudgment against
the party obtaining the same and his securities, for the ainountof the Principal, inter

tended to confer on the court a power which did not exist already, or to enlarge its
powers. It was merely directory to the clerk in the case speciﬁed therein. Black
V. Caruthers, 6 Humph. 91-93. This statute, like others giving summary rem
edies in derogation oi the common law, is to be strictly construed. It does not
extend to the case where the dissolution of the injunction is produced by the
abatement of the suit in consequence of the debt of the complainant. Patterson

is dissolved. the Chancellor shall require of the defendant a
refunding bond, in double the amount of the sum allowed to

-be collected, payable to the opposite party, and conditioned
to refund the amount collected, if so ordered on ﬁnal hearing;
and the court may render a decree upon such bond, against
any or all of the parties thereto.
A refunding bond will not be dispensed with because the defendant has given
Asirnilar bond in another State upon a bill pending there between the same par
ties enncerning the same mutter. McKim v. Fulton, 1 Tenn. 238. The bond will
.be valid, although delivered to the clerk on the street. Hansard v. Bank of

And see Q 8946 et reg.

Clerks may be required to give bond as special commissioners or receivers.

the office of receiver, see Waters v. Carroll, 9 Yerg. 102, 107; Whitesides v.
Laiferty, 8 Humph. 150. The practice of appointing the clerk receiver is not

allowable in England, and ought to be discouraged with us; and the court cannot
impose such duties upon the clerk without his consent.

The same power is conferred by Q 4420, sub-sec. 5. In clumcery, depositions
are taken without an order of court for that purpose ; and if taken by commis
sioii, and upon due notice, it is not error to read them, though taken after the
commencement of the term at which an order previously made for taking them

had expired. Richmond v. Richmond, 10 Yeig. 343.—And see Q 8847 at seq.
A party who takes a deposition is not bound to read it. If the opposite party

For the order of trying jury causes, see Q 2947 et seq. ; Q 2960 a.

"The right of

trial by jury shall remain invioliite.” Const. of Tenn., Art. 1, Q 6. That is, as it
existed at common lnw at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. McGinnis
v. State, 9 Humph. 43, 60; Trigally v. Mayor, &c., 6 Cold. 382, 385; noteto Q 6,
Art. 1, Const. of Tenn. And see 3 Greenl. Ev., Q 260, ct scq.—Isxurs offact are

It is discretionary with the court, without demand of the parties, to

a pica.


It would seem from Q 4393 that ajury may be had in chancery upon

The court has also power to direct a suit at law to try the right. Farms

wortli v. Arnold, 4 Sneed, 252, 266. An injury sounding iii dnnniges, as a cheat
in the sale of a horse, when it comes collaterally before a court of ch-ancery, as up
on an injunction to prevent the collection of the notes for the price, must be tried
by jury. A decree cannot be based upon the report of aclerk upon such a matter,
nor can a decree autiiorize such a report. In such a ciisc, the right of trial by

jury is undoubted, and it is error to determine the damages by reference to the
clerk and master, for which the case will be reversed and remanded. King v.

Street, 1 Yerg. 450.

since either party may demand a jury, unless the demand is made. " Dig., Q 591.]
In one case, where the bill was for the cancellation of a deed, alleging that the

clause of warranty was forged by the defendant, and this was directly denied by
the answer, the Supreme Court was unwilling to try the issue, but sent it to law

to be tried by a jury. Mayse v. Garner, Mart. & Yerg. 383, 385.

So, on a bill to

enjoin o judgment at law because the plaintiff has tampered with the jury, the
court directed an issue to try the plaintiﬂ"s right anew. Humphreys v. Blevins, 1
Tenn. 36, 88. Upon a bill to sct aside the deed of a husband in fraud of dower,
it was held that a jury was proper to try the validity of the deed, but not to 86

sess the damages, and that the court might disregard the whole matter. London
v. London, 1 Humph. l. If the party applying for ajury tenders an immaterial
issue, the Supreme Court will not remand to have the proper issue submitted to
another jury, but will grunt relief, treating the facts as though the chancellor had
found them for himself. Gass v. Mason, 4 Sneed, 497, 507

Form of the iuue.—See London v. London, 1 Humph. 4; Gsss v. Mason, 4
Sneed, 603 ; Lancaster v. Ward, l Tenn. 430.

Trial of tit» t'.ssue.—'l‘he issue may be read to the jury from the bill or answer,
or on a distinct paper. Richmond v. Richmond, 10 Yerg. 843.
Eject of the answer as evideuce.—ln Mayse v. Garner, Hart &Yerg. 888, 885,
the Supreme Court in sending an issue to n court of law for trial by jury, cite the
following authorities as showing the eﬂk-ct the answer is to have as evidence be

fore the jury: Hunter v. Wallace, 1 Tenn. 240; Act of 1782, ch. 11 § 8; 9
Cranch, 160; I Phil. Ev., 115 and note. Hunter v. Wallace holds that the jury
are not concluded by the general rule that there must be two witnesses to disprove
s. fact stated in the answer, or one witness with corroborating circumstsnoﬂ.
In another case the same judge (Overton) expressed the opinion. and reasoned
at length to enforce it, that the rule of evidence Fhﬁllid be the same ns where the
trial is by the clmncc-llor. But White, J., doubted and Campbell, J., thought the
practice ought to be the some as at law. Humphreys v. Blevins, 1 Tenn. 178.

This opinion of Judge Overton is reiterated by Humphreys, J., in Lancaster v.
‘Ward, 1 Tenn. 430. 488, Where it is said that if there are circumstances besides the
testimony of one witness, the jury will give them such credit as they may think
they deserve. The Act of 1782, ch. ll, Q8, abore quoted, provided that “tho
mode of proceeding by such juries shall be the same in every respect as in trials
at law ; the same rules and methods to be observed in this case as have been
practised upon questions of fact being submitted by a court of chancery to s

common lawjurisdiction."

This act is not in terms carried into the Code ; but

consult for similar provisions, {Q 3156, 4469.

In the later case of Richmond Y.

V Richmond, the court says that the answer is evidence, but is subject to all the
rules applicable to other witnesses, and will be looked upon by thejury with all
the suspicion that attaches to an interested person. 10 Yerg. 848.
Eject of the vcrdict.—Where the issue is made up and submitted to the jury
upon the mere motion of the chancellor, without the application of either party,

the verdict is merely advisory and the chancellor may disregard it, if he sees ﬁt,
and decree “ in the teeth of the verdict." Lowe v. Traynor, 6 Cold. 638, 685 ', Or
gain v. Ramsey, 3 Humph. 580; London v. London, 1 Humph. 1, 15; Hum
phreys v. Blevins, 1 Tenn. 178, 182 ; Simmons v. Tillery, lTenn. 274; Fsrnsworth
v. Arnold, 2 Sneed, 252, 257. But the verdict ought to have weight with the
court, and especially with the court of errors. 8 Humph. 580.
It is not as obligatory upon the court as is the ﬁnding of a verdict upon an is.

sue at common law, but still it has much weight, and will be sustained, unless it
appears satisfactorily to be unsupported proof. Timmons v. Garrison, 4 Humph.

§ 113 TENN. STAT.
§ 148. But this rule is to be understood in a limited or qualiﬁed sense, and as be"
ing applicable in its greatest force to issues depending upon such questions as
the credibility to be given to witnesses, etc. 6 Cold. 638. But if the issue is

granted on demand of a party, the verdict is said to be as binding as a verdict at
law.

White v. Chestnut, Knoxville, 1863 ; cited in Heiskell‘s Digest, p. 603'.

And see Q 3156.

But if the party demanding ajury submit an immaterial issue,

the verdict will be disregarded, a new issue refused, auda decree pronounced as
if no verdict had been found. Gass v. Mason, 4 Sneed, 494, 507. See Q 4-468.
And not more than two new trials can be granted to the same party, except for

error in the charge of the court, or in admitting or rejecting testimony, or for
the misconduct of the jury.

See § 3122, and note.‘ An action at law differs from

an issue out of chnncery in this: In the former, the motion for a new trial must
be made before the court in which the action is brought; while in the latter, the
motion must be made in the court that directed the issue. Farnsworth v Arnold,

§ 2 Sneed, 252, 255. In directing an action at law, the court always directs it to
be brought in such a form that the result shall be regarded as conclusive. Ib.;
citing 2 Dan. Ch. Pr., 762-4.

Where a chancellor directs an issue to be tried in

a court of law, he can only be informed of the result of the trial by a certiﬁed
copy oi‘ the record.

The individual certiﬁcate of the Judge who conducted the

trial at law will not do; and in such case, a trial dc nova of the issue will b'e
directed. Baker v. King, 6 Yerg. 402.

[Cases in which a decree may be made in favor of one defendant against
another are-—

§ 1. Where the decree, made in favor of the complainant against one or more
defendants, operated to create a right or equity in favor of one defendant against
another, which might be adjusted and protected in the same suit,--an equity or

right arising out of the decree itself, and not from a state of facts outside of the
decree made, and not determined by it.

Keeling v. Heard, 8 Head, 592.

§ 2. Cases where the complainant and one defendant have rights of the same
nature, and growing out of the same facts, against the other defendant, so that

Need not re
elte facts.

§ 4476. Decrees need not recite the facts upon which they
are based, but only the conclusions to which the court has

come.

Prlor to the Act of 1835, ch. 20, Q 15, 16, [supi-a, {Q 3108, 8121,] a decree

which did not contain a recital of the facts upon which it was founded was erro
neous. Burdoine v. Shelton, 10 Yerg. 4|, 46. And the depositions and proofs
copied into the transcript were no part of the record on which error could be
assigned. Mitchell v. Nicholson, 8 Yerg. 194, 197; Kenner v. Smith, 8 Yerg 206
§ 7. The only errors which could be complained of were errors in law, appearing

from the facts stated in the bill; which facts as stated, were to be taken as true.
§ 8 Yerg. 207. These cases probably produced the provisions in the Act of 1835,
as above quoted.

A decree cannot be rendered upon proof alone, where the facts are not set out
in the bill or answer. Cunningham v. Wood, 4 Humph. 417. But see Oocke v
Trotter, 10 Yerg. 218. If the answer makes out a proper case for relief, though.
it dilfers from the bill, still the court will decree it. Rose v. Mynatt, '7 Yerg. 30.

§ 4484. .The decree may divest the title to property, real or
personal, out of any of the parties, and vest it in others, and
such decree shall have all the force and effect of a convey
ance by such parties, executed in due form of law.
[Act 1801, ch. 6, § 48.]
The practice before the act of 1801 was to decree that the parties having the
legal title should make n deed as directed in the decree; but since that act, the
practice has been to divest the right by decree. Claiborne v. Crockett, Meigs 607,

of whom it is made.

[Act 1837-8, ch. 176, § 1.]
This section seems to resolve the doubt expressed in Claiborne v. Crockett,

Meigs, 607, 611, whether since the act of 1801, [Q 448-1,] the mere direction in I
decree to the clerk and master to make s deed, nnd a deed made in conformity

thereto, will divest the title out of the person sgninst whom the decree is made,

§ 4493. Upon theﬁnal decree, the costs shall be paid by theppon ﬂllll
OCIQOI
party against whom the court shall adjudge them, according
to its discretion.

[Act 1782, ch. 11, § 3.]

This discretion is not an arbitrary, capricious, blind discretion, but a legal dis
cretion, resulting from a view of the case, taken in combination with all the cir
cumstances, and calling to its aid the issue of like questions, heretofore, upon
cases as nenrly analogous as can be found. Clark v. Clark, 4 Hayw. 86, 43 ; per

White, J., arguendo.

It is an equitable discretion, depending upon the circum

stances of the case, guided by principles that have been established, and regulated
by the practice that has been adopted in analogous cases. Perkins v. McGavock,
§ 3 Hayw. 255; citing ‘Z Atk. 400, 551; 3 Bro. Ch. 890. A trustee who is in no
default gays no costs; but it is otherwise if he deny the trust and clnim the bene

ﬁt accruing therefrom.

§ 8 Hsyw. 255-7. And seo the same case, 3 Hayw. 265.

A person becoming security for costs undertakes with reference to the discretion
ary power of the chancellor to adjudge costs agninst either party, and is subject to
its exercise whether his principal succeeds or not. Hence, if the bond is conditioned

that the complainant shall “ successfully prosecute a bill of complaint this day
ﬁled by him" etc., “ or pay all costs incident on failure thereof," it will bind the
surety for the costs, if taxed against his principal and himself, although his prin
cipal may have succeeded in the suit. Allison v. Stephens, 2 Head. 261-2. And see
Ogg v. Leinart, 1 Heisk. 40; note under Q 3196 c. A court of Chancery has no
power to give a summary decree for costs against the surety of a. next friend.
Hackney v. Hackney, 8 Humph. 452. A clerk who is entitled to costs on a
judgment sought to be enjoined, is not a proper party to the bill, and service
on him does not give the court jurisdiction to proceed against the others, and

decree against him for the costs of the suit in equity. McGavock v. Elliott,
§ 3 Yerg. 373. Upon the death of a defendant, the untaxed costs must be paid by
the complainant; for although his heirs are before the court, they are formal

parties only, and are not liable to pay costs.

Craig v. Leiper, 2 Yerg. 193, 199;

citing 4 Bro. Ch. 178; 8 Atk. 773; 2 Ves. 465.

Where the defendant is proba

bly insolvent, the complainant will be decreed to pay costs in the ﬁrst instance, and
to recover over. Smith v. Lurry, Cooke, 82-'5, 328. A party claiming to have a
§ 1ocator’s share laid oil‘ to him, on a special contract, and being denied speciﬁc re
lief and remitted to his remedy at law, because the locatorunder whom he had
claimed had not acted with proper skilland diligence in the location, was required
to pay costs. Hall v. Ross, 8 Hayw. 200. A vendee who had obtained a judgment
on his bond for title, without the payment of the purchase money, and retaining
the possession of the property, being‘ decreed to accept a conveyance of the title,
was held to pay the costs, in equity and at law. Kennedy v. Woolfolk, 8 Hayw.
§ 195, 200. On acontest between crnﬂicting grants and entries, the costs were
adjudged against the losing party, in White v. Crockett, 3 Hayw. 183, I89. An
injunction against a paid judgment was made perpetual by a decree on pro 00»

fesso, and defendant taxed with costs.

Pigg v. Sparrow, 3 Hayw. 144.

Whew

a non-resident plaiiidlfhud covenanted to convey land, and oifered by letter to

the defendant promised, but did not furnish, but obtained judgment by attachment

was enjoined and decreed to pay the costs of the injunction bill, but the phtintiﬂ

to pay the costs at law.

After a case has been decided in the Supreme Court, a motion to obtain the

question is not properly before the court. Planter's Bank v. Perrin, Jackson,

§ 449C. The court has no original , jurisdiction, but appeals
and writs ot error, or other proceedings for the correction of
errors, lie from the inferior courts of law and equity, within
each division, to the Supreme Court held for that division.
[Act 1822, ch. 13, § 4.]
A history of the present Supreme Court and its jurisdiction will be found
in 4 King’s Digest, §11,256. The present Constitution, Art. 6,§2, simply
repeats the corresponding provision in the Constitution of 183-it on this sub
ject, aud leaves the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as it was before.
See also note to Q2, Art. 6 of the Constitution of the State.—'I'he Supreme
Court has jurisdiction, as necessarily incident to its appellate jurisdiction,
to render judgment, upon motion, against a sheriff for failing to make due
land proper return of executions issuing from the Supreme Court. Bank of
Tennessee v. Cannon, 2 Heisk. 428. But has no jurisdiction to render
judgment by motion against the principals in favor of a surety, nor against
a co-surety. Waters v. Lewis 9 Yerg 16; Ward v. Thomas, ,2 Cold. 565;
Evans v. Vanbibber, lThomp. Cas. 61. Sections 8631, 3632, and 8633 were
intended to apply to the inferior tribunals, and confer no power on the
Supreme Court to render a judgment ‘on motion of a. surety against his prin
cipal. 2 Cold. 568. The Constitution having deprived the Supreme Court
of original jurisdiction, such jurisdiction cannot be conferred by an act of the
Legislature. Miller v. Coulee, 5 Sueed,432; State v. Bank of East Tennessee,
§ 5 Sneed, 573 ; Ward v. Thomas, 2 Cold. 565, 572. The latter clause of the
second section of the sixth article of the Constitution was not even intended
to give the Legislature power to confer upon the court original jurisdiction of
those cases of which it had such jurisdiction in 1834; but was designed to con
ﬁne the clause to such powers as, though not appellate, were absolutely necessary
in carrying out and completing the appellate jurisdiction, given by the ﬁrst clause
of the same section. 2 Cold. 572. Thus, if an appeal is prayed and defeated,
the Supreme Court will aid the appellant by any writ which would overcome and
remove the injury. King v. Hampton, 8 Hayw. 59; Craddick v. Pritchett, Peck,
§ 22. As a mandamus to compel the inferior judge to signs. bill of exceptions.
State v. Hall, 3 Cold. 255. But cannot issue a mandamus to compel an inferior

judge to hear a habeas corpus case.

State v. Elmore, 6 Cold. 628.

And so, a.

mandamus to compel the Circuit Court to proceed with the trial of a cause was
refused, because the Court had no original jurisdiction, and could not take cog
nizance of any matter, unless in reference to an appeal prayed and defeated or
attempted to be defeated. 4 Hayw. 59.
Y In Chancery causes, the theory that the Court is merely for correction of
errors is often violated in practice.

Often extensive original jurisdiction is exer

cised to afford relief, which the Court below should have given, and the cause is.
given a form and character, only shown by the records in the Supreme Court.
Dibrell v. Eastlaud, 3 Yerg. 538.

The Supreme Court will, in equity cases, do»

justice and settle the rights of all the parties before it, not being restrained by
§ 1.cchnic.al rules. Ward v. Thomas, 2 Cold. 565, 568. Thus, the decree below
is generally altered in some respects, often revised and entirely changed, giving

the cause a form and character only to be learned from the records of the
Supreme Court. A bill is dismissed below, but on appeal sustained, and an
account ordered in the Supreme Court, in taking which the whole evidence is
heard, and almost the entire substance of the cause appears in the records oi‘ the

Supreme Court. 3 Yerg. 585-6. And sec} 2108; Q 4496, and note.—But a bill

amendment of clerical errors after the adjournment of the term, see
§ 2877, 2878,
and note.
The above statute has been applied in numerous cases. It has given sanction
to a rule repeated in many cases, that where the justice of a case has been attained,
the Supreme court will llul. reverse because of irregularities in the proceedings
by which the ﬁnal result has been reached. See David v. Bell, Peck, 184 ; Gregory
v. Allen, Mart. 8: Yerg. 74; Brinson v. Smith, Peck, 194; Sanders v. Young, 1
Head, 219; Clark v. Bell, 8 lluinph. 26, 28; Kelton v. Blevins, Cooke, 90, 102 ;
Cannon v. Blake-more, 10 Humph. 227; Langford v. Love, 3 Sneed, 808, 311.
So, one defendant will not be heard to complain that a judgment is erroneous as
to his co-defendant; because such an error does not affect the merits of thejudg
ment against himself. Smith v. Foster, 3 Cold. 139, 147 ; Bentley v. Hurxthal,
§ 3 Head, 378. This departure in the rules of pleading, which is said to have had its
origin under the above section of the Code, does not extend to the action of
replevin. Only v. Dickinson, 5 Cold. 486.
The rule is that the Supreme Court can onl_v reverse for errors apparent on the
face of the record aﬂerting the merits of lite ront1‘oun's_t/. Wells \'. Hosely, 4
Cold. 401, 405. But if it can see from the record tharthe court below has com
mitted such nn error, it will reverse the judgment and award a new trial, whether
a new trial was asked for in the court below or not. 4 Cold. 405. Butit the error
complainettof be in Ihe action of Ihe jury, as, l'or example, that there was no evi
dence to support the verdict, this court cannot reverse the judgment and grant a
new trial, unless the court below had been asked to correct the error, and had
refused to do so; and in such n case, the refusal of the court to set aside the ver
dict aud grant a new trial is the error, for which the Supreme Court will reverse.
Ib. The question is, has the eourt below committed an error, aﬂ'ecting the merits
of the controversy, and is such error apparent? To entitle the party to a re

versal in the Supreme Court, it is_ not necessary that he should have asked the
court below to correct its own errors.

Ib.

In chanrcr_z/ cases, where it appears from the record that more satisfactory
evidence can be obtained, the Supreme Court has power to rermmdfor ad
ditional proof. Grider v. Harbison, 6 Cold. 208, 214; citing as authority for the

rule, Cowan v. Dodd, 8 Cold. 279.-Seealso

§ 3167-3171.

Where the court below has no jurisdiction, but renders judgment as ifit had,
the Supreme court may strike from the docket, correct, or aﬂirm the judgment.
§ 2 Yerg. 441.
A Court of Errors must presume every thing, which the record will permit, in
support of thejudgment, and nothing against it. Mart. 5: Yerg. 80. The plaintilfin
error must place his cause in such position as to show that the judgment, of which
he complains, is erroneous; as that improper evidence was objected to and
admitted, or that the court refused, upon application,to instruct the jury properly.
Cool, (Coopers’ Ed.), 89; lb, 403. Where the record does not show that it
contains all the wfderwe. the court will presume there was enough to sustain the

verdict. s Head, 608; 5Sneed, saz; 4 Cold. 249,2 Humph. 140; Ib. 529; z
Head. 97. But this doctrine of presumption has its limit.

Cooke, 102.

Where the record shows that it contains all the proof, and a fact material to
‘sustain the action does not appear to have been proved, a verdict cannot cure
the defect of proof, nor can the proof be presumed. 2Humph. 426. Where
there is no evidence in the record as to publication for non-residents, but the

decree recites that publication was duly made this will be sufficient. 1 Cold. 581
And see note to§ 4859.
A verdict will not cure a failure to aver the dishonor of a note. 2 Humph.
§ 162. And see Aidcr by verdict, under Q 2969.
The Supreme Court will not remand u cause for an amendment which might
or not be asked for below. 1 Yerg. 443. And as to amendments in the S_u
preme Court, and when the court will remand to amend, see Q 2872, and note

will not cure a. deﬁciency oi‘ proof. 2 Humph. 425 and 455. As where a record

purports to set out all the evidence in a case of replevin or trover, and does not
show the value of the property. 4 Cold. 246. See also 2 Humph. 425.
§ 2. Where the record shows that the judge thought the verdict against the
evidence and the law, but refused a new trial on some other ground. 4 Sneed,
§ 591; 10 Humph. 428.
Where there is more than one issue, and for separate causes of action,
found for plaintiff, and no evidence to support the verdict on one. 4 Sneed, 557.
§ 4. Where the verdict is not a true response to the evidence, it will be held that
there is no evidence to support the verdict.

§ 2 Sneed, 630; 4 Humph. 899; 10

.. Ib., 42s.
§ 5. For great rashness of the jury. 8 Humph. 278.
§ 6. If illegl evidence was admitted; unless it appears that it could not have
inﬂuenced the result. 1 Cold. 127. But it will be conclusively presumed that

by consent.

Term, 1867.
§ 12. Judgment in replevin against two, good as to one, and erroneousas to

one, will be revised as to both.

The general rule in actions for debts and torts

does not apply to replevin. 5 Cold. 486. And see Q 2974, and note.
§ 13. Before the act of 1851-2, ch. 152, a judgment against two, and erroneous
as to one, would be reversed in all cases. 10 Humph. 247; 4 Ib., 273; 7 Ib., 286

But in 8 Gold. 139 and 148, if was held that in actions of tort, the judgment on
appeal would be s.lﬁt-med as to those against whom there was no error, and re
versed as to those against whom there was error. See 4 Cold. 199; Qé 2972
