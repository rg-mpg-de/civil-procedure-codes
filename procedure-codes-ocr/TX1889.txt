0) A commission of arbitration and award was created by the Act of July 9th, 1879; 16
Leg. S. S. p. 30. It had power to hear and pronounce award upon all civil cases pending in
the supreme court or the court of appeals, referred to it by consent of parties. The conclu
sion or award of the commission was reported to the court by which the case was referred,
and was made the judgment of the court. Such orders were made by the proper court as
were necessary or proper to make the award effective. It wras held that the commission was
not a court but simply a board of referees or arbitrators, whose award could be made the
judgment of the court, and whose opinion was limited to the particular case in which it was
delivered. Henderson v. Beaton, 52 T. 29. The Act of 1879 was amended by the Act of Feb.
9th, 18S1; 17 Leg. p. 4, which also authorized the supreme court and court of appeals to refer
to the commission civil cases pending in those courts for examination and reports, which
could be used by the respective courts to facilitate them in reaching a conclusion upon the law
and facts of the case. The opinion of the commissioners when adopted by the court were
published as the opinion thereof in other cases. The Act of Feb. 9th, 1881, was held to be
constitutional. Stone v. Brown, 54 T. 330. It was further held that questions decided by the
commission in arriving at their award, in cases referred to them by agreement, are as conclu
sively settled for the purpose of further proceedings in that case, as they would be by the
adjudication of the case by the appellate court. Burns v. Led better, 66 T. 282; Stelle v.
Shannon, 62 T. 198. And the conclusions announced by the commissioners, when adopted by
the court, are as authoritative as any of its own decisions. Wooters v. Hollingsworth, 5S T.
371. But the adoption of the conclusions of the commission does not imply an approval of the
reasons given therefor. Hearn v. Gillett, 62 T. 23. Further amendments were made by the

§ 533. Collateral consanguinity is the relation subsisting among per

tion in the direct course of relationship between the two parties makes a degree. Thus, broth
ers are related in the first degree. The mode of computing degrees of collateral consanguinity
is to begin with the common ancestors and reckon downwards, and the degree the two persons,
or the more remote of them, is distant from the ancestor, is the degree of kindred between
them. Thus, an uncle and nephew are related in the second degree. First cousins are related

proper remai'ks of the successful counsel are presumed to have influenced the minds of the jury,

the decision is announced. [Act Feb'y 6, 1853; April 6, 1853, § 99; 4th Leg.

the court, either verbally or in writing, what they desire to communicate.
§ 1308. May ask further instruction. The jury may, after having re
tired, ask further instruction of the court touching any matter of law. For

retirement, the court may in like manner permit such portion of the deposition
or paper to be again read to the jury.
§ 1311. Disagreement of jury. The jury may, after the cause is sub
mitted to them, be discharged by the court when they cannot agree, and both
parties consent to their discharge, or when they have been kept together for
such time as to render it altogether improbable that they can agree.
§ 1312. May be discharged. They may also be discharged by the court
when any calamity or accident may, in the opinion of the court, require it;
and they shall be so discharged when by sickness or other cause their number

tried at the same or another term.

role for discriminating between actual and exemplary damages. G. H. & S. A. R'y Co. v. Dunlavy,
56 T. 256 ; but the omission is not error, where a proper charge has not been asked. T. &
P. R. R. Co. v. Casey, 52 T. 112. Should instruct as to what constitutes a partnership. Bacon
v. Lloyd, 1 App. C. C. § 286.
§ 1317. Requisites of the charge. The charge shall be in writing and
signed by the judge, and he shall read it to the jury in the precise words in
which it is written ; he shall not charge or comment on the weight of evidence ;
he shall so frame the charge as to distinctly separate the questions of law from
the questions of fact; he shall decide on and instruct the jury as to the law
arising on the facts, and shall submit all controverted questions of fact solely
to the decision of the jury. [Act Feb'y 5, 1853; April 10, 1853, § 99; 6th

Aet. 1320. Refused instructions are part of record. When the instruc
tions asked, or some of them, are refused, the judge shall note distinctly which
of them he gives, and which he refuses, and shall subscribe his name thereto,
and such instructions shall be filed with the clerk, and shall constitute a part
of the record of the cause, subject to revision for error without the necessity
of taking any bill of exception thereto. [Act May 13, 1846; June 22, 1846,
§ 100; 1st Leg. p. 363; P. D. 216.]
§ 99; 6th Leg. p. 19; P. D. 1464.]

cases where a special verdict of the jury is rendered, or the conclusions of
fact found by the judge are separately stated, the court shall, unless the same
be set aside and new trial granted, render judgment thereon, and it shall be
sufficient for the party excepting to the conclusions of law or judgment of

•There seems to be no change made by the new article except the insertion of "the" be
tween " of " and " fact," and some changes in punctuation. See old Article and note below.
[Old Art. 1333. The jury shall render a general or special verdict as may be directed by
the court ;* and the verdict shall comprehend the whole issue or all the issues submitted to
them ; and upon a trial by the court, the judge shall, at the request of either of the parties,
also state in writing the conclusions of ' the fact found by him, separately from tlie conclu
sions of law ; 2 which conclusions of fact and law shall be filed with the clerk 3 and shall con
stitute a part of the record ; and in all cases where a special verdict of the jury is rendered i
or the conclusions of fact found by the judge are separately stated, the court shall, unless the
same be set aside and new trial granted, render judgment thereon, and it shall be sufficient
for the party excepting to the conclusions of law or judgment of the court a to cause it to be
noted on the record in the judgment entry, that he excepts thereto; and such party may there
upon take his appeal or writ of error without a statement of facts or further exceptions in the
transcript, but the transcript shall in such case contain the special verdict or conclusions of
fact and law aforesaid and the judgment rendered thereon.] [Acts 1879, ch. Ill, p. 119; and

1 1) The refusal of a judge to furnish a statement must be shown by the record. C. N. Bank
v. Stout, 61 T. 567.
§ 813. Or when it is apparent that the refusal worked no injury to the complain
ing party. Sliuber v. Holcomb, 2 App. C. C. § 224. And see Barnett v. Abernathy, 2 App.
C. C. § 775. A party is entitled to have the statement prepared and filed in the record upon
request made therefor within a reasonable time. In this case, the request was made immedi
ately after the motion for new trial was overruled, and the term continued for ten days there
after. North v. Lambert, 3 App. C. C. § 53. When the judge failed to state the conclusions
of fact found by him, as well as his findings of law. exception thereto having been properly
reserved, the judgment was reversed and cause remanded for a new trial. Oallaghan v. Grenet,
66 T. 239.
§ 335. The sufficiency of the
facts found to sustain the legal conclusion of the judge will not be considered unless excepted
to. When such exception is made and noted in the judgment entry, the adverse party must
take notice of it, and if, in his opinion, the conclusions of fact or law are not so full or accurate
as they should be, for his own protection, it will be his right to have a statement of facts from
which the judgment may be sustained ; or in any other respect, to have a complete presenta
tion of the case. If no exception to the conclusions of law or judgment of the court is noted,
unless the failure to except be waived or not insisted on, the only inquiry will be, whether the
pleadings justify the judgment. Continental Insurance Co. v. Milliken, 64 T. 46. Also, see G.
C. & S. F. R'y Co. v. Fossctt, 66 T. 338.
§ 1334. Not void for want of form. No special form of verdict is re
quired, and where there has been a substantial compliance with the require
ments of the law in rendering a verdict, the judgment shall not be arrested or
reversed for mere want of form therein. [Act Alay 13, 1846; June 22, 1846,

conveyance of real estate, or for the delivery of "personal property, the decree
may pass the title to such property without any act to be done on the part of
the party against whom the judgment is rendered. [Act May 13, 1846; June
22, 1846; § 120; 1st Leg. p. 363; P. D. 1481.]
§ 1339. Court shall enforce its own decrees. The court shall cause its
judgments and decrees to be carried into execution ; and where the judgment
is for personal property, and it is shown by the pleadings and evidence and
the verdict, if any, that such property has an especial value to the plaintiff,
the court may award a special writ for the seizure and delivery of such prop
erty to the plaintiff, and the court may, in addition to the other relief granted
in such case, enforce its judgment by attachment, fine and imprisonment.

tors and guardians) that an order of sale shall issue to the sheriff or any
constable of the county where such property may be, directing him to seize
and sell the same as under execution, in satisfaction of the judgment; and if
the property can not be found, or if the proceeds of such sale be insufficient
to satisfy the judgment, then to make the money, or any balance thereof re
maining unpaid, out of any other property of the defendant, as in case of
ordinary executions. [Act May 13, 1846; June 22, 1846, §119; 1st Leg.

§ 1340a. Writ of possession awarded. Hereafter, when any order fore
closing a lien upon real estate is made in a suit having for its object the fore
closure of such lien, in any court having jurisdiction, such order shall have all

suit of foreclosure, and any person claiming under the defendant to such suit
by any right acquired pending such suit ; and the court shall so direct in the
judgment providing for the issuance of such order, and the sheriff or other
officer executing such order of sale shall proceed by virtue of said order to
place the purchaser of the property sold under the same in possession thereof
within thirty davs after the day of sale. [Act of February 10, 1885. Took

on appeal are required to be sent up by a justice of the peace (Rev. Stats. Art. 1640) that the
district court can determine what the cause of action presented and tried before the magis
trate was. Though the pleadings may have been oral, the statute requires that a brief state
ment showing their character shall be noted on the magistrate's docket. (Rev. Stats. Art.
1573.) Maass v. Solinsky, 67 T. 290.
This article does not dispense with the necessity of forming, in some way, the issues to be
tried, a brief statement of which should be noted on the magistrate's docket; therefore, when
the record shows affirmatively that there were no pleadings made by the defendant in a suit
for a debt before a justice of the peace, it was error on appeal to hear evidence of payment.
It seems that the record in the supreme court would be sufficient to show the pleadings, if
there appeared therein the brief statement required by the statute, either from the transcript
oSthe justice's docket or that of the district court, or by entry on the minutes of the latter
cOHrt, either independent of or in the judgment itself. Moore v. Jordan, 67 T. 394.

Murrell, 1 App. C. C. § 891 ; Mensing v. Ayres, 2 App. C. C. § 562 ; Brunswig v. Kramer, 2 App.
C. C. § 804. The rules applicable to formal written pleadings in the district and county
courts have no application in proceedings in the justice's court. Formal pleadings are
dispensed with. Where there is no exception to the claim or account of the plaintiff, evidence
will not be excluded on account of the generality of the statements therein. I. & G. N. Ry.

plaintiff should allege that defendant "was a corporation duly incorporated." T. & P. R. R.
Co. v. Miller, 1 App. C. C. § 262. In a suit against an indorser upon a note, it is not
necessary that the citation should state that the principal maker of the note was dead,
