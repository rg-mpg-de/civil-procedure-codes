Section 1. Name of the act This act shall be known as the Code
of Practice in Civil Cases of this State.
Sec. 2. Classification of remedies. Remedies in civil cases in the
courts of this state are divided into two classes—
1. Actions.
2. Special proceedings.
Sec. 3. Civil action defined. A civil action is an ordinary pro
ceeding in a court of justice, by one party against another, for the
enforcement or protection of a private right, or the redress or pre
vention of a private wrong. It may also be brought for the recovery
of a penalty or forfeiture. (Notes.)
Sec. 4. Special proceeding defined. Every other remedy in a civil
case is a special proceeding.
Sec. 1. Forms of action abolished — one form substituted. The
forms of all actions and suits, heretofore existing, are abolished,1
and hereafter there shall be but one form of action for the enforce
ment or protection of private rights, and the redress or prevention
of private wrongs, which shall be called a civil action. (Notes.)
Sec. 2. Plaintiff and defendant. In such action the party com
plaining is known as the plaintiff, and the adverse party as the de
fendant.
Sec. 3. Proceedings to be either ordinary or equitable. The pro
ceedings in a civil action may be of two kinds—
1. Ordinary.
2. Equitable.
Sec. 4. What proceedings may, and when they must, be equitable.
The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable proceedings, in
all cases where courts of chancery, before the adoption of this code,
had jurisdiction; and must so proceed, in all case3 where such juris
diction was exclusive. (Notes.)
Sec. 5. Ordinary in all other cases. In all other cases the plain
tiff must prosecute his^ action by ordinary proceedings.
Sec. 6. Action on lost writing may be by ordinary proceedings.
[Amended Dee. 21, 1863.] An action upon a written obligation,
which has been lost or destroyed, or on judgments, the records of
which have been destroyed, may be prosecuted by ordinary proceed
ings. {Notes.)
Sec. 7. No dismissal because wrong proceeding adopted—correc
tion. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceedings adopted,
shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of the action, but merely
a change into the proper proceedings by an amendment in the plead
ings, and a transfer of the action to the proper docket. (Notes.)
Sec. 8. How error corrected by plaintiff. The error mentioned
in the last section, may be corrected by the plaintiff without motion,
at any time before the defendant has answered ; or afterward, on
motion in court.
Sec. 9. When defendant may have correction made. The defendant
shall be entitled to have the correction made in the following cases:
1. Where the action has been commenced by equitable proceed
ings, the defendant, by motion made at the time of filing his answer,
may have them changed into ordinary proceedings, when it appears
that, by the provisions of section five, the plaintiff should have
adopted ordinary proceedings, and in addition, that his answer pre
sents a defense on which he is entitled to a trial by jury.
2. Where the action has been commenced by ordinary proceed
ings, the defendant, by motion made at or before the time of filing
his answer, may have them changed into equitable proceedings, when
it appears that, by the provisions of section four, the plaintiff should
have adopted equitable proceedings. (Notes.)
Sec. 10. Equitable issues in ordinary actions—how tried. Where
the action has been properly commenced by ordinary proceedings,
either party shall have the right, by motion, to have any issue, which,
before the adoption of this code, was exclusively cognizable in chan
cery, tried in the manner hereinafter prescribed1 in cases of equit-
able proceedings ; and if all the issues are such as, before the adop
tion ot this code, were cognizable in chancery, though none were
exclusively so, the defendant shall be entitled to have them all tried
as in cases of equitable proceedings. (Notes.)
Sec. 11. When and how plaintiff may require security upon an
equitable issue being made in an ordinary action. If the plaintiff's
claim is for money due by contract, and the defendant puts in a de
fense of exclusively equitable cognizance) upon the plaintiff filing an
affidavit that he verily believes that he will succeed in the action,
and that the collection of his claim after judgment will be endan
gered by the delay arising from such defense being put in, the court
shall require the defendant to give security for the payment of any
judgment the plaintiff may obtain in the action, and upon his fail
ure to give such security, shall order the defendant to pay into court
an amount sufficient to discharge the plaintiff's claim and his prob
able costs ; upon which order execution may bo issued as upon a
judgment, and the amount collected upon execution shall be brought
into court and await the deciska of the action, and be paid to the
plaintiff or defendant, according to such decision. But no such se
curity shall be required if the trial of the equitable defense takes
place during the term at which it is put in, nor until all defenses to
the action, other than those of equitable cognizance, are tried or dis
posed of in favor of the plaintiff.
Sec. 12. Error as to kind of proceeding waived if not objected to
at proper time. An error as to the kind of proceedings adopted in
the action, is waived by failure to move for its correction at the
time and in the manner prescribed in this chapter ; and all errors in
the decisions of the court, on any of the motions named in this chap
ter, are waived unless excepted to at the time ; which may be done
by the clerk noting, at the end of such decision, words of the fol
lowing import : " To which decision the plaintiff (or defendant) ex
cepts." 1
Sec. 13. Provisions of the code apply to both kinds of proceeding.
The provisions of this code, concerning the prosecution of a civil
action, apply to both kinds of proceedings, unless the contrary ap
pears.
Sec. 14. When judgment in ordinary proceeding may be annulled
or modified by equitable proceeding. A judgment obtained in an ac-
tion by ordinary proceedings, shall not be annulled or modified by
any order in an action by equitable proceedings, except for a defense
■which has arisen or been discovered since the judgment was ren
dered.' But such judgment does not prevent the recovery of any
claim, though such claim might have been used as a defense by way
of setoff or counterclaim in the action on which the judgment was
recovered. (Notes.)
Sec. 15. Court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction over all courts.
The court of appeals shall have appellate jurisdiction over the final
orders and judgments of all other courts of this commonwealth, sub
ject to the exceptions in the next section. (Notes.)
Sec. 16. Cases in which it has no jurisdiction. Where the action
or proceeding is for the recovery of money or personal property,
and the matter in controversy does not exceed one hundred dollars
in value, or, in behalf of the defendant, where the judgment of the
inferior court is against him for money or personal property, not ex
ceeding in value one hundred dollars, unless reduced below that
amount by a setoff or counterclaim, or where the judgment grants
a divorce, or where the judgment or order is by the quarterly court,
county court, police court, city or mayor's court, or justice's court,
and an appeal is given to the quarterly or circuit court, the court
of appeals shall have no appellate jurisdiction. (Notes.)
[Amended, Feb. 9, 1858.] The court of appeals shall have ju
risdiction over all judgments [in actions] for the recovery of money
or personal property, where the value in controversy is fifty dollars
or over that amount.
Sec. 17. Cost not included in giving jurisdiction. The costs are
not to be included in estimating the value necessary to give juris
diction to the court of appeals.
Sec. 18. Circuit courts have general original jurisdiction. Cir
cuit courts have original jurisdiction of all actions and proceedings
for the enforcement of civil rights, or redress of civil wrongs, except
■where exclusive jurisdiction is given to other courts.
[Amendment of April 3, 1861.] That hereafter, in actions for the
recovery of money or property, where the amount claimed by the
plaintiff does not exceed fifty dollars, exclusive of interest, and the
defendant or defendants are non-residents of Kentucky, and said
defendants are the owners of real estate in this commonwealth,
but not of personal estate sufficient to satisfy the demand of the
plaintiff, jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the circuit and equity
and criminal courts of the county where such real estate is situate
to try such action, as though the amount claimed exceeded fifty dol
lars; and the plaintiff shall be entitled to sue out all such provisional
remedies, and to prosecute his demand in the same way and under
the same rules as now apply to similar actions in said courts, where
jurisdiction is now given by law. (Notes.)
Sec. 19. Jurisdiction of Louisville chancery court. The Louis

ment shall make a minute of the same, as part of the record. The

vided by law. (Notes.)

order for the safe-keeping, or for the payment, or deposit in court,
or delivery of the subject of the action to such person as it may

lecy will support action. An action to recover the possession of
specific personal property taken under a distress warrant, where it

against the party who sued out the warrant; and the property
claimed under such action, may, under the order for its delivery, be
taken from the officer who seized it, where he has no other claim to
hold it than that derived from the warrant. The indorsement of a

petitions in actions founded on a note, bond, bill of exchange,
mortgage, or other written obligation of the defendant; nor to de
fenses founded on the written obligation, release, or written ac-
knowledgment of' the plaintiff, unless the writing on which the

be stated. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of a
court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to

allegation is made in a petition, and is not controverted in the
answer, or made in the answer in relation to a counterclaim or set
off, and is not controverted in the reply, it need not be proved on
the trial. (Notes.)
Sec. 149. Performance of precedent condition may be staled generally.
In pleading the performance of a condition precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such
performance, but it may be stated, generally, that the party duly
performed all the conditions on his part; and if such an allegation
is not controverted as stated in the last section in regard to judg
ments, it shall not be necessary to prove it on trial. (Notes.)
Sec. 150. In action for libel or slander, no inuendo need be stated.
In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in

cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to state, generally,
that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff;

hundred and forty-eight, in regard to judgment, it shall not be ne
cessary to prove it on the trial. (Notes.)

the mitigating circumstances. (Notes.)

material allegation of the petition, not specifically controverted by
the answer, and every material allegation of new matter, in the an
swer, constituting a counterclaim or setoff, not specifically contro
verted by the reply, must, for the purposes of the action be taken
as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer not relat
ing to a counterclaim or setoff, or of new matter in a reply, is to
be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct de
nial, or avoidance, as the case may require. Allegations of value,
or of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true, by the
failure to controvert them.1 (Notes.)
Sec. 154. What is a material allegation. A material allegation in
a pleading, is one essential to the claim or defense, and which could
not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient.
(Notes.)
Sec. 155. Deeds and other writings relied on in pleading, must be
fled. If either party shall rely upon any deed or other writing, he
shall file, with his pleading, the original deed or writing, if in his
power.1 If he can not produce such deed or writing, he shall so
state in his pleading, together with the reason therefor ; and if such
reasons are sufficient, he may file the best evidence of the contents
of such deed or writing in his power. Original deeds and other
writings, filed by either party, as above provided, shall remain on
file for the inspection of the other party, until allowed by the court
to be withdrawn ;% and, in such case, copies, attested by the clerk,
shall be substituted by the party withdrawing the originals. (Notes.)
thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended upon
such terms as may be just. (Notes.)
Sec. 157. Facts to be found according to proof. Where the vari
ance is not materia], as provided in the last section, the court may
direct the fact to be found according to the evidence, and may order
an immediate amendment without costs.
Sec. 158. Claim or defense unproved in general scope, fatal.
Where, however, the allegation of the claim or defense, to which
the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or particu
lars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be
deemed a case of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure
of proof. (Notes.)
Sec. 159. Plaintiff may amend without leave before answer. The
plaintiff may amend his petition, without leave, at any time before
an answer is filed, and without prejudice to the proceedings already
had. (Notes.)
Sec. 160. Demurrer overruled, party may answer or reply. Upon
a demurrer being overruled, the party demurring may answer or
reply.
Sec. 161. Amendments to be liberally allowed—immaterial errors
disregarded. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, amend1 any pleadings or pro
ceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case ;
or, when the amendment does not chnnge substantially the claim or
defense, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts
proved. The court may likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer
or reply to be made after the time limited in this code, or, by an
order, enlarge such time.2 And whenever any proceeding taken by
a party, fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this
code, the court may permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as
to make it conformable thereto. And when the allegations of a
pleading are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the
olaim or defense is not apparent, the court may require the plead
ing to be made definite and certain by amendment. The court
must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in
the proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of the
adverse party;1 and no judgment shall be reversed or affected by
reason of such error or defect. (Notes.)
Sec. 162. Supplemental pleading allowed. The plaintiff and de
fendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supple
mental complaint, answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the
case, occurring after the filing of the former petition, answer, or
reply. (Notes.)

ance if not ready. When either party shall amend any pleading or

same term, or to another term of the court.
Sec. 164. Verification, may be made on calling action for trial.

either party, as a deposition between the party interrogating and
the party answering.1

sonable notice of their being filed.
Sec. 172. Failing to answer—when ground of continuance. The
trial of an action, by ordinary proceedings, shall not be postponed

the facts the party believes will be proved by the answers thereto, and
that the party has not filed the interrogatories, nor omitted to file
them, for the purpose of delay. Whereupon, if the party will con

mitted by those interrogated, the trial shall not be postponed for
that cause.

in ordinary proceedings. The proceedings in section one hundred

thereof, according to such affidavit, shall be deemed to be sustained,
and judgment given accordingly.
Sec. 178. Court may compel answers to interrogatories. The court

money, or securities for money, or evidences of debt, in the

thereupon such proceeding may be had as in other actions, and
judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, to subject the prop
erty of the defendant in the hands of the garnishee, or for what

property which may be under its control, in the following order :
1. Personal property, other than slaves.
2. Slaves.
8. Real property, or so much thereof as may be necessary

It may order the sheriff to repossess himself, for the purpose of
selling it, of any of the attached property which may have passed

and the sheriff shall, under such order, have the same power to take
the property, as upon an order of attachment.
Sec. 257. Any person may prefer claim to property—liens and
priorities to be ascertained. Any person may, before the sale of
any attached property, or before the payment to the plaintiff of the
proceeds thereof, or of any attached debt, present his petition,1

ment, or stating a claim to the property, or to an interest in, or

a reference to a commissioner, or may impanuel a jury to inquire
into the facts. If it is found that the petitioner has title to, a
lien oh, or any interest in such property, the court shall make such
order as may be necessary to protect his rights. The costs of this
proceeding shall be paid by either party, at the discretion of the
court.
Where several attachments are executed on the same property,
the court, on the motion of any one of the attaching plaintiffs, may
order a reference to a commissioner, to ascertain and report the
amounts and priorities of the several attachments. (Notes.)
Sec. 258. Plaintiff may be required to give additional security.
The defendant may, at any time before judgment, after reasonable
notice to the plaintiff, move the court for additional security on the
part of the plaintiff; and if on such motion, the court is satisfied

or is not sufficient for the amount thereof, it may vacate the order
of attachment, and direct restitution of any property taken under
it, unless in a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, sufficient
security is given by the plaintiff.

the ground of its having been issued contrary to the provisions of
article one of this chapter ; and the judge, on an inspection of the
papers in the action, or of authenticated copies of them, shall have

ment now pending, or hereafter commenced, the affidavit or grounds
of attachment may be amended so as to embrace any grounds of

the time of the commencement of said proceeding, the lien created
by the suing out or levying the original attachment shall be held

period so limited, unless the attachment is reinstated in the mean
time. (Notes to 285.) *
Sec. 296. By whom reinstatement made. A judge of the court
of appeals, in any case in which the plaintiff has secured the right
to apply therefor, in the manner provided in the last section, may,
upon an inspection of copies of the record, and of the depositions
and affidavits read upon the motion to discharge, reinstate the
attachment; and, if the order of reinstatement shall be filed in the
clerk's office of the court in which the action is pending, within the

Sec. 299. Causes for which it may be granted. Where it appears
by the petition that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded,
and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the com
mission or continuance of some act which would produce great or
irreparable injury to the plaintiff, or where, during the litigation, it
appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do,
or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the
plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending
to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be
granted to restrain such act. It may also be granted in any case
where it is specially authorized by statute.1 (Notes to 297.)
Sec. 300. By whom granted. The injunction may be granted at
the commencement of the action, or at any time before judgment,
by the court, or by the judge thereof or any circuit judge, or by
the presiding judge of the connty court,2 where it appears by the
petition that the plaintiff is entitled thereto. And, during a liti
gation, it may be granted by the court, or by the judge thereof or
any circuit judge, where it satisfactorily appears by affidavits that
aufficient grounds exist therefor. (Notes to 299.)
Sec. 301. Court may authorize clerk to grant The judge of the
circuit court for any county may, if he deem it right and proper,
by an order duly entered on the order book of said court, author
ize the clerk of said court to grant injunctions and restraining
orders, in the same manner and under like restrictions that the pre
siding judge's of county courts may grant injunctions and restrain
ing orders ; but no such authority shall be conferred on any deputy
of such clerk. {Notes to 297.)
Sec. 302. Granted before judgment subject to further order. All
injunctions granted before final judgment, shall be subject to tho

answered. An injunction shall not be granted against a defendant
who has answered, unless he has had notice of the application
therefor. (Notes to 297.)

tion to stop the general and ordinary business of a corporation, or
the operations of a turnpike, railroad, or canal company, or of a
municipal corporation, or of the trustees of a town or any building,
erection, or other work, or to restrain a nuisance, or the unlawful
issue or circulation of small notes or bills, can only be granted by
the court, or by the judge thereof, or any circuit judge, upon rea
sonable notice of the time and place of the application therefor,
to the party enjoined. (Notes to 297.)
Sec. 306. Where notice given, either party may read affidavits.
On the hearing of an application for an injunction of which notice
has been given, each party may read affidavits. (Notes to 297.)
Sec. 307. Injunction bond—terms and amount In every case,
the court or judge granting an injunction shall specify in the order
therefor an amount, for which the party obtaining it shall give secu
rity in a bond to the party enjoined, before the injunction shall be
come effectual ; which amount shall be sufficient to cover all the
probable damages and costs that may be occasioned by the injunc
tion. The court or judge may prescribe the effect of the bond, so
as to secure to the party enjoined the damages to which he may be
come entitled, if it is finally decided that the injunction ought not
to have been granted. Where the injunction is to stay proceedings
upon a judgment or final order for money, the amount for which se
curity is required shall be sufficient to cover, with other damages,
the sum enjoined, with five years' interest thereon. Where the in
junction is to stay proceedings upon a judgment for property, the
amount specified in the order shall be sufficient to cover also the
rent, hire, or value of the use thereof for two years; and in case
of personal property, its value likewise. {Notes to 297.)
Sec. 308. Bond to be executed—terms where judgment stayed.
The order of injunction shall not be issued by the clerk, until the
bond mentioned in the last section has been executed in his office by
one or more sufficient sureties1 of the party obtaining the injunc
tion. Where the injunction is to stay proceedings upon a judgment
or final order, the bond shall be to the effect that the party obtain
ing the injunction will satisfy the judgment or order, or so much of
it as is enjoined, to the extent to which the injunction may be dis
solved; and that he will also satisfy any modified judgment or order
that may be rendered or made in lieu of it, or so much of it as ex
ceeds the amount left unenjoined. In other cases, unless otherwise
directed by the court or judge, the bond shall be to the effect that

twenty-seven to forty-two, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and
six of the Revised Statutes, except that a petition in equity shall be
filed wherever a bill in chancery is directed therein, which sections
are as follows :
1. In what county to be proved and recorded. Wills shall be
proved before, and admitted to record by, the county court of
the county of the testator's residence; if he had no known
place of residence in this state, and land is devised, then in
the county where the land, or the greater part thereof, lies ; if
no land is devised, then in the county where he died or that
wherein his estate, or the greater part thereof, shall lie, or
where there may he any debt or demand owing to him.

circuit court. The writ of error from the circuit court shall be
sued out/ within five years after rendering the order of probate
or rejection in the county court, and from the court of appeals
within one year after the final decision in the circuit court.
3. Will not evidence till proved—then conclusive. No will
shall be received in evidence until it has been allowed and ad
mitted to record in a county court, and its probate before such
court shall be conclusive, until the same is superseded, re
versed, or annulled.
4. Court may compel production. Any such court, on being
informed that a person has in his custody the will of a testa
tor, may summon him, and, by proper process, compel him to
produce the same.
5. How non-resident's will proved. When a will of a non
resident of this state relative to estate within this state has
been proved without the same, an authenticated copy thereof,
and the certificate of probate thereof, may be offered for pro
bate in this state. When such copy is so offered, the court to
which it is offered shall presume, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, that the will was duly executed and admitted
to probate as a will of personalty in the state or country of the
testator's domicil, and shall admit such copy to probate as a
will or personalty in this state. And if it appears from such
copy that the will was proved in the foreign court of probate
to have been so executed as to be a valid will of lands in this,
state by the law thereof, such copy may be admitted to probate
as a will or real estate.
6. Depositions of subscribing witness may be taken. When
any will or any such authenticated copy is offered for probate,
and a witness attesting the same resides out of this state, or,
though in the state, is in confinement in another county or cor
poration under legal process, or is unable from sickness, age or
other infirmity, to attend the court before which the same is
offered, or resides at a distance of more than fifty miles, such
court may cause a commission to be issued, annexed to the said
will or copy, and delivered to the person authorized by law to
take depositions in other cases, to take his deposition. The
deposition of such witness shall be taken and certified as de
positions are taken in other cases, except that no notice need
be given of the time and place of taking the same, unless it is
in a case in which the probate is opposed by some person who
has made himself a party. And the proof so given shall have
the same effect as if it had been given in the court from which
the commission issued.
7. Parties interested may he summoned. A person offering
or intending to offer to a county court a will for probate, may
obtain from the clerk of such court process directed to the
proper officer of any county, requiring him to summon any
person interested in such probate to appear at the next term
of such court, and show cause why the said will should not be
admitted to record.
8. Court may cause all persons interested to be summoned.
The court to which a will is offered for probate, may cause all
persons interested in the probate to be summoned to appear on
a certain day.

such probate may be summoned, or proceeded against by order
of appearance, and to any person so interested who is an in
fant or of unsound mind, a guardian ad litem may be assigned
as in other cases.
10. Appeal to circuit court—parties—trial by jury. When the
proceeding is taken to the circuit court, all necessary parties shall
be brought before the court ; and upon the demand of any one
of them, a jury shall be impanneled to try which, or how much,
of any testamentary paper produced is, or is not, the last will
of the testator. If no jury be demanded, the court shall deter
mine that question, and the final decision given shall be a bar
to any other proceeding to call the probate or rejection of the
will in question—subject to the right of appeal, or writ of error
to the court of appeals, as hereinbefore named ; but nothing
in this section shall preclude a court of chancery from its juris
diction to impeach such final decision, for such reason as would
give it jurisdiction over any other judgment at law.
11. County court may proceed ex parte and summarily. A
county court may, however, without summoning any party, pro
ceed to probate and admit the will to record, or reject the
same.
12. Persons not made parties, non-residents and infants may
contest Any person interested, who, at the time of the final
decision in the circuit court, resided out of this state, and was
proceeded against by order of appearance only, without actual
appearance, or being personally served with process, and any
other person interested, who was not a party to the proceeding
by actual appearance, or being personally served with process,
may, within three years after such final decision in the circuit
court, by bill in chancery, impeach the decision, and have a
re-trial of the question of probate ; and either party shall be
entitled to a jury for the trial thereof. An infant, not a party,
shall not be barred of such proceeding in chancery until twelve
months after attaining full age.
13. Effect of proceedings in chancery to contest. But no such
proceeding in chancery, for establishing or avoiding a will,
shall operate further than is necessary to the rights of such in
fant, non, resident, or other party, or otherwise affect the rights
of any other person interested in the probate.
14. Record of proof on trial in circuit court to be evidence in
chancery proceeding. The record of what is proved or deposed
in court, by witnesses on the motion to admit a will to record,
and any depositions lawfully taken out of court on such motion
of witnesses who can not be produced on a trial afterward be
fore a jury, may, on such trial, be admitted as evidence, to have
such weight as the jury shall think they deserve.
15. Will to remain in clerk's office where recorded. Every will
or authenticated copy so admitted to record by any court, shall
be recorded by the clerk thereof, and remain in his office, ex
cept during such time as the same may be carried to another
court under a subpena duces tecum.
16. Witt may be deposited in clerk's office for safe-keeping.

same, according to the directions on a sealed envelop. If there
are no such directions, or the party entitled does not apply,
the will shall be handed to and opened by the next or some
succeeding county court, after the death of the testator, and
there retained for probate. (Notes.)

corded, shall have the jurisdiction of making the settlements.
(Notes to 520.)
Sec. 522. Caveats regulated by Revised Statutes. The proceed
ings on caveats shall be according to the provisions of chapter
eleven of the Revised Statutes, which are as follows :
1. How to proceed. If any person obtains a survey of land
to which another claims a better right, such other may enter a
caveat with the register, to prevent the issuing of a grant until
the right is determined. The caveat shall state the plaintiff's
claim, and the reason why the grant should not issue. It shall
be verified by his affidavit, or by that of his agent, and declare
that it is entered in good faith, with the intention of procuring
the land for the plaintiff, and not for the benefit of the person
against whom it is entered. A copy of the caveat, certified by
the register, shall, within fifteen days from the time it was en
tered, be handed to the clerk of the circuit court of the county
where the land, or the greater part thereof, lies, who shall im
mediately issue a summons thereon, returnable to the first day
of the next term of the court, against the defendant, and renew
the same, from term to term, if required. If the summons be
not returned, or be returned not executed, the caveat shall be dis
missed at the costs of the plaintiff, unless it appear that the
non-return or non-execution was not occasioned by the neglect
of the plaintiff. If the summons is executed fifteen days before
the first day of the term, and the caveat shall stand for trial at
that term, and the defendant shall, on or before its call, file his
written response thereto, verified by his affidavit. If the sum
mons be not so executed, it shall stand for trial at the next
term after it is so executed. All issues of fact made by the
caveat and the response, shall be tried by a jury, if required
by either party. If the defendant be a non-resident of this
state, he may be proceeded against, and with the like effect as
is permitted against a non-resident in any other suit. Upon
service of the summons, or upon notice to the plaintiff of the
filing of defendant's response in the clerk's office, during vaca
tion, either party, respectively may proceed to take depositions.
The court may permit an amendment of the statement con
tained in the caveat or response, and may give time for further
preparation. If the copy of the caveat be not lodged with the
clerk within the fifteen days, it shall be deemed to be abandoned ;
and upon certificate from the clerk that none such has been left
with him, the register may proceed in disregard of the caveat.
The court may, in its discretion, require the plaintiff to give
security for costs, and on his failure to give the same, dismiss
his suit.
[Amended, March 1, I860.] 1. That hereafter when a caveat
shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, it shall be
placed on the ordinary docket, and stand for trial as an ordin
ary action. •»
2. This act shall apply to caveats now pending, and shall
take effect from its passage.
[Further amended, February 21, 1863.] That no caveat
shall be dismissed in consequence of the same not having been
filed with or handed to the clerk of the circuit court of the
county where the land or the greater part thereof lies, within
fifteen days from the time it was entered with the register; but
in all cases where a caveat has been or may be filed in the
clerk's office of the circuit court of the county in which the
land or the greater part thereof lies, such court shall dispose
of and decide the case on its merits, disregarding the time it
was filed or handed to the clerk ; Provided, however, the plain
tiff or plaintiffs in the caveat shall not have a longer period
than the second term of the court after the caveat is entered
with the register, for filing the same in the clerk's office.
[Further amended, March 3, 1865.] 1. That the third and
tenth subdivisions of the first section of chapter eleven of the
Revised Statutes, entitled " caveat," be, and the same are here
by, so amended, as to allow the plaintiff in the caveat, or his
agent, or attorney, to file a copy of the caveat, certified by the
register, in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the
county in which the land, or the greater part thereof, lies, within
sixty days from the time when the caveat was entered.
2. Appeals lie from judgments upon caveats. The judgment
upon a caveat shall be liable to revision in the court of ap
peals, by appeal or writ of error, in the same manner, in all
respects, as any other judgment of the circuit court.
3. Copy of the judgment to be delivered into land office. A
copy of the judgment, if in favor of the defendant, must be de
livered into the laud office within three months from the time it
is rendered, or a new caveat may, for that cause, be entered

whom a subpena is issued for his attendance as a witness,
shall conceal himself, or otherwise intentionally evade the ser
vice of the subpena; or if any person who has a minor under

place to be fixed in the warrant, to give his testimony, and answer
for the contempt. If the warrant is not for immediately bringing
the witness before the court or officer, a sum shall be fixed in which
the witness may give bond with surety for his appearance, and if no
sum is fixed by the court or officer, it shall be one hundred dollars.
Sec. 598. Extent of punishment of witness for contempt The

657. Court to exercise control over interrogation of witnesses.
658. Direct and cross-examination.
659. What is a leading question, and by whom it may be asked.
660. Party can not impeach, but may contradict his own witness.
661. How a witness may be impeached by the adverse party.
662. Before evidence of a contradictory statement is admissible, witness
must be questioned concerning the statement
663. Evidence of good character inadmissible before general character
has been impeached.
664. Re-examination of witness.
665. Witnesses may be examined out of hearing of each other.
666. Persons present, though not summoned, may be compelled to testify.
667. Judge or juror may be examined as a witness.
668. Writings shown to a witness must be shown to the adverse party.
Sec. 656. Order in which proof to be given on trial. The party
who begins the case must ordinarily exhaust his evidence before the
other begins. But the order of proof shall be regulated by the court,
so as to expedite the trial, and enable the tribunal to obtain a clear
view of the whole evidence.1
Sec. 657. Court to exercise control over interrogatories to witnesses.
The court shall exercise a reasonable control over the mode of in
terrogation, so as to make it rapid, distinct, as little annoying to the
witness, and as effective for the extraction of the truth as may be ;
but subject to this control, the parties may put such legal and per
tinent questions as they may see fit. The court, however, may
stop the production of further evidence on a particular point,
where the evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reason
able doubt.
Sec. 658. Direct and cross-examination. The examination of a
witness by the party producing him is the direct examination ; the
examination of the same witness upon the same matter, by the ad
verse party, the cross-examination. The direct examination must
be completed before the cross-examination begins, unless the court
otnerwise directs.
Sec. 659. What are leading questions, and by whom asked. A
question that suggests to the witness the answer which the examin
ing party desires, is a leading question. On the direct examination,
leading questions are not allowed, except under special circum
stances, making it appear that the interests of justice require it.
On cross-examination the adverse party may put leading questions ;
but if he examines the witness on new matters, such examination is
subject to the same rules as the direct examination.
Sec. 660. Party can not impeach, but may contradict his own wit
ness. The party producing a witness, is not allowed to impeach
his credit, by evidence of bad character, unless it is a case in which
it was indispensable that the party should produce him ; but he may
contradict him by other evidence, and by showing that he has made
statements different from his present testimony. {Notes.)
Sec. 661. How witness impeached by adverse party. A witness
may be impeached by the party against whom he is produced, by
contradictory evidence, by showing that he has made statements
different from his present testimony, or by evidence that his gen
eral reputation for truth or immorality renders him unworthy of
belief, but not by evidence of particular wrongful acts, except that
it may be shown by the examination of a witness, or record of judg
ment, that he has been convicted of a felony. (Notes to 660.)
Sec. 662. Before contradictory statement admissible, witness must
be questioned concerning it. Before other evidence can be offered
of the witness having made, at another time, a different state
ment, he must be inquired of concerning the same, with the
circumstances of time, place, and persons present, as correctly as
the examining party can present them ; and if it is in writing, it
must be shown to the witness and he allowed to explain it. (Notes
to 660.)
Sec. 663. Evidence of good character, when admissible. Evi
dence of the good character of a witness is inadmissible until his
general reputation has been impeached. (Notes to 660.)
Sec. 664. Re-examination of witness. A witness once examined,
can not be re-examined as to the same matter, without leave of the
court. But he may be re-examined as to any new matter upon
which he has been examined by the adverse party. After the ex
amination on both sides is concluded, the witness can not be recalled
without leave of the court. (Notes.)
Sec. 665. Witnesses may be examined out of each other's hearing.
If either party requires it, the judge may exclude from the court
room any witness of the adverse party not at the time under exam
ination, so that he may not hear the testimony of the other wit
nesses.
Sec. 666. Persons present, though not summoned, must testify.
A person present before a court or a judicial officer, may be com
pelled to testify in the same manner as if he was served with a
subpena.
Sec. 667. Judge or juror may be examined. The judge or a juror
may be called as a witness by either party, but in such case, it is in
the discretion of the court to suspend the trial and order it to take
place before another judge or jury ; and where a party knows, at
the time the jury are sworn, that a juror is to be called by him as
a witness, he shall then disclose it, and the juror shall be excluded
from the jury.
Sec. 668. Writings shown witness must be shown adverse party.
Whenever a writing is shown to a witness, it may be inspected by
the adverse party, and if proved by the witness, it must be read to
the jury before his testimony is closed ; otherwise, it can not be
read, unless the witness is recalled.
Sec. 669. All persons competent, except those in next section. All
persons, except those enumerated in the next section, shall be com
petent to testify in a civil action.
Sec. 670. Who are incompetent—exceptions. The following per

client's consent.
6. [Amended, March 2, I860.] Persons interested in an
issue, in behalf of themselves, and parties to an issue, in be
half of themselves or those united with them in the issue. But
this sixth division shall not hereafter be so construed as to ex
clude a witness from testifying who has no interest in the issue
to be tried.
[Further amended, March 2, I860.] That subdivision six, of
section six hundred and seventy, of the civil code, be, and the
same is hereby, so amended as to allow the plaintiff or owner,
in an action to recover the value of lost baggage against com
mon carriers, innkeepers or wrongdoers, to testify in his own
behalf as to the contents and value thereof.
[Further amended, January 10, 1866.] That subdivision
six, of section six hundred and seventy, of the civil code of
practice, be, and the same is hereby, so amended, as to allow
the plaintiff's or owner's wife, in an action to recover the
value of lost baggage against common carriers, innkeepers or
wrongdoers, to testify as to the contents and value thereof, in
the same manner and to the same extent that the husband is
now allowed to testify by law.
7. Negroes, mulattoes or Indians, in any action or proceed
ing where a white person, in his own right, or as representa
tive of a white person, is a party, except in actions brought to
recover a penalty or forfeiture for a violation of law, against a
negro, mulatto or indian.
[Amended, February 14, 1866.] That negroes and mulat
toes shall be competent witnesses in all civil proceedings in
which negroes and mulattoes are the only parties interested in
the issue, and in all criminal proceedings where a negro or
mulatto is a defendant. (Notes.)
Sec. 671. All other objections go to the credit of witnesses. All
other objections to witnesses shall go to their credit alone, and be
weighed by the jury or tribunal to which their evidence is offered.
{Notes)
Sec. 672. New matter stated in answer to interrogatories, adverse
party may testify. In actions by equitable proceedings, if a party,
in answering interrogatories,1 state new matters not responsive to
the inquiries, the party interrogating may, before the trial, file hia
written statement, under oath, concerning such new matters, which
shall be read as a deposition. (Notes.)
Sec. 673. Same in ordinary proceedings. In actions by ordinary
proceedings, if a party, in answering interrogatories,2 or when in
troduced as a witness, states new matters not responsive to the in-
quiries of the adverse party, the latter shall be allowed to testify
orally concerning such new matter.
Sec. 674. Trustees, etc., not personally interested may testify. A
personal representative or trustee not personally interested in the
action shall not be incompetent to testify by reason of being a
party.1
Sec. 675. Officers or trustees of a corporation. An officer or in
habitant of a county, city or town, or an officer, member or trustee
of a corporation or religious society, although a party to the action,

courts. {Notes)
Sec. 685. Action to be dismissed, if bond not given. An action in
which a bond for costs is required by the last section, and has not

which a bond for costs has been given, the defendant may, at any
time before judgment, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move
the court for additional security on the part of the plaintiff; and if,
on such motion, the court is satisfied that the surety in the plaintiff's

b* fixed by the court, sufficient security is given by the plaintiff.
Sec. 689. Attorney liable for cost, till bond given. Where process

who is required, by the first section of this chapter, to give security
for costs, but who has failed to do so, the attorney shall be liable as

Sec. 693. How a notice may be served. The service of a notice
shall be by giving a copy thereof to the person to whom it is directed,
or, if he can not be found at his usual place of abode, by leaving a
copy there with a white .person over the age of sixteen years, resid
ing in the same family with him, or, if no such white person is there,
then by affixing a copy to the front door of such place of abode. If
the person to whom the notice is directed can not be found, and has
no known place of abode in this state, the notice may be served by
delivering a copy to his attorney. The return of the officer, or the
affidavit of the person who served the notice, shall state the time
and manner of the service ; and where a copy of the notice is not
given to the person to whom it is directed, the return or affidavit

Sec. 698. How on persons constructively summoned. A notice to
a person constructively summoned, and not appearing, shall be served
on the attorney appointed to defend for him.
Sec. 699. In what cases on the counsel. Where it is not other
wise specially provided in this code, a notice to a party in an action
of any motion or proceeding to be made or taken therein in court,
or before a judge, may be served upon such party or his attorney;

livering to him a copy of the notice.
Sec. 700. How served when party not a resident of the county.
Where a party to an action does not reside in the county in which
it is pending, a notice to him to take depositions may be served by

be the duty of the sheriff, and of every constable to whom any no
tice in an action may be delivered for service, within his county, to

obedience of the process of the court.
Sec. 702. Offer to compromise before trial. The defendant in an
action for the recovery of money only, may, at any time before the trial,
serve upon the plaintiff, or his attorney, an offer in writing, to allow
judgment to be taken against him for the sum specified therein. If
the plaintiff accepts the offer, and gives notice thereof to the defend
ant, or his attorney, within five days after the offer was served, the
offer, and an affidavit that the notice of acceptance was delivered in
the time limited, may be filed by the plaintiff, or the defendant may
file the acceptance, with a copy of the offer verified by affidavit, and
in either case, the offer and acceptance shall be noted upon the rec
ord; and judgment shall be rendered accordingly. If the notice
of acceptance is not given in the period limited, the offer shall be
deemed withdrawn, and shall not be given in evidence or mentioned
on the trial. If the plaintiff fails to obtain judgment for more than
was offered by the defendant, he shall pay the defendant's costs
from the time of the offer. (Notes.)
Sec. 703. Offer to allow judgment for certain sum. In an action
for the recovery of money only, the defendant having answered,
may serve upon the plaintiff, or his attorney, an offer in writing,
that, if he fails in his defense, the amount of the recovery shall be
assessed at a specified sum. If the plaintiff accepts the offer, and
gives notice thereof to the defendant, or his attorney, within five
days after it was served, and the defendant fails in his defense, the
judgment shall be for the amount so agreed upon. If the plaintiff
does not accept the offer, he shall prove the amount to be recovered,
as if the offer had not been made. The offer shall not be given in
evidence or mentioned on the trial. And if the amount recovered
by the plaintiff does not exceed the sum mentioned in the offer, the
defendant shall recover his costs incurred in the defense, in respect
to the question of amount, to be taxed under the direction of the
court. (Notes to 702.)
Sec. 704. Making offer to compromise, no ground of continuance.
The making of any offer, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
shall not be a cause for a continuance of an action, or a postpone
ment of a trial.
Sec. 705. Parties may agree upon a case, and submit to court for
decision. Parties to a question which might be the subject of a civil
action, may, without action, agree upon a case containing the facts
upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission of
the same to any court which would have jurisdiction if an ac
tion had been brought. But it must appear by affidavit that the
controversy is real, and the proceedings in good faith, to determine
the rights of the parties. The court shall, thereupon, hear and de
termine the case, and render judgment as if an action were pend
ing. (Notes.)
Sec. 706. What constitutes the record in such case. The case, the
submission and the judgment shall constitute the record.
Sec. 707. Costs may be adjudged—appeal. The judgment shall
be with costs, may be enforced, and shall be subject to reversal, in
the same manner as if it had been rendered in an action, unless
otherwise provided in the submission.
CHAPTER V.
OFFER TO CONFESS JUDGMENT.
708. Defendant may offer to confess judgment, and if plaintiff refuses to
accept, he shall be subject to costs, unless he recovers more than
the offer. •
Sec. 708. Offer to confess judgment After an action for the re
covery of money is brought, the defendant may offer in court to
confess judgment for part of the amount claimed, or part of the
causes involved in the action. Whereupon, if the plaintiff, being
present, refuses to accept such confession of judgment in full of his
demands against the defendant in the action, or having had such
notice, that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of the time
of making it, as the court shall deem reasonable, fails to attend,
and, on the trial, does not recover more than was so offered to be con
fessed, such plaintiff shall pay all the costs of the defendant incurred
after the offer. The offer shall hot be deemed to be an admission
of the cause of action, or amount to which the plaintiff is entitled,
nor be given in evidence upon the trial.
Sec. 709. Officer may require indemnifying bond before selling. If
an officer who levies, or is required to levy, an execution upon per
sonal property, doubts whether it is subject to the execution, he
may give to the plaintiff therein, or his agent or attorney, notice
that an indemnifying bond is required. Bond1 may, thereupon, be
given by or for the plaintiff, with one or more sufficient sureties, to
be approved by the officer, to the effect that the obligors therein will
indemnify him against the damages which ho may sustain in conse
quence of the seizure or sale of the property, and will pay to any
claimant thereof the damages he may sustain in consequence of the
seizure or sale, and will warrant to any purchaser of the property
such estate or interest therein as is sold ; and, thereupon, the officer
shall proceed to subject the property to the execution, and shall
return the indemnifying bond to the circuit court of the county in
which the levy is made. (Notes.)
Sec. 710. Unless bond given, officer may refuse to proceed. If the
bond mentioned in the last section is not given, the officer may re
fuse to levy the execution ; or, if it has been levied, and the bond
is not given in a reasonable time after it is required by the officer,
he may restore the property to the person from whose possession it
was taken, and the levy shall stand discharged. (Notes to 709.)
Sec. 711.' Claimant or purchaser must look to the bond. The
