forth in the complaint, as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or con
nected with the subject of the action ;
Second. In an action arising on contract, any other cause of action
arising also on contract, and existing at the commencement of the action.
Sec. 81. The defendant may set forth by answer as many defences
and counter claims as he has ; they shall each be separately stated, and
refer to the causes of action which they are intended to answer, in such
manner that they may be intelligibly distinguished ; the defendant may also
demur to one or more of several causes of action in the complaint, and
answer the residue.
Sec. 82. Sham and irrelevant answers or defences and frivolous de
murrers may be stricken out, or judgment rendered notwithstanding the
same, on motion, as for want of an answer.
THE REPLY.
Sec. 83. When the answer contains new matter constituting a counter
claim, the plaintiff may, within thirty days, reply to such new matter, denying
each allegation controverted by him or any knowledge or informa
tion thereof sufficient to form a belief, and he may allege in ordinary and
concise language without repetition, any new matter not inconsistent with
the complaint, constituting a defence to such new matter in the answer ; or
he may demur to an answer containing new matter, when upon its face it
does not constitute a counter claim or defence ; and the plaintiff may demur
to one or more of such defences or counter claims, and reply to the residue
of the counter claims.
Sec. 84. If the answer contains a statement of new matter constitut-
ing a counter claim, and the plaintiff fails to reply or demur thereto within
the time allowed by law, the defendant may move on notice for such judgment
as he may be entitled to upon such statement, and the court may
thereupon render judgment, order a reference, or assessment of damages
by a jury, as the case may require.
Sec. 83. If a reply to any counter claim is insufficient, the defendant
may demur thereto, stating the grounds thereof.
GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING.
Sec. 86. Every pleading in a court of record sliall be subscribed by
the attorney of the party, and when any pleading in a case is verified, all
subsequent pleadings, except demurrers, shall be verified also.
Sec. 87. The verification shall be to the effect that the same is true
to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those matters
stated on his information and belief, and as to those matters that he believes
it to be true, and shall be made by the party, or, if there are several par
ties united in interest and pleading together, by one at least of such parties
acquainted with the facts, if such party is within the county where the
attorney resides, and capable of making the affidavit. The verification
may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the party making such
pleading is absent from the county where the attorney resides, or for
some cause is unable to verify it ; and shall be to the effect that the same
is true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief. When a
corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof;
and when the state or any officer thereof in its behalf is a party, the veri
fication may be made by the attorney general. The verification may be
omitted when an admission of the truth of the allegation might subject
the party to prosecution for felony.
Sec. 88. It is mot necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading,
the items of an account therein alleged, but he shall deliver to the adverse
party, within ten days after a demand thereof, in writing, a copy of the
account verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, if within
the personal knowledge of such agent or attorney, to the effect that he
believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The
court, or judge thereof, may order a further or more particular bill.
Sec. 89. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining
its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view to
substantial justice between the parties.
Sec. 90. If irrelevant or redundant matter is inserted in a pleading
it may be stricken out on motion, and when a pleading is double, or does
not conform to the statute, or when the allegations of a pleading are so
indefinite or uncertain, that the precise nature of the charge or defence is
not aPParent> tne court may strike it out on motion, or require it to be
amended.
gEC- 9^ In pleading a judgment, or other determination of a court,
or officer, of special or general jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to
6tate tne ^acta conferrmS jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination
may be stated, to have been duly given or made. If such allegation is
controverted, the party pleading is bound to establish on the trial, the facts
conferring jurisdiction,
Sec. 92. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract> •* shtHl not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance,
but it may be stated, generally, that the party duly performed all
the conditions on his part, and if such allegation is controverted, the party
pleading is bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such per
formance.
Sec. 93. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom,
jt ;g 8ufficjent to refer to 8UCn 8tatute by its title, and the day of its ap
proval, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof,
Sec. 94. In actions by or against corporations, created by or under
tne laws of this state, it is sufficient to refer in the complaint or answer to
the act of incorporation, or the proceedings by which such corporation was
* * * *
created.
Sec. 95. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to
8tate m tne complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the
application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the
cause of action arose ; but it shall be sufficient to state generally, that the
same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff ; and if such alle
gation is controverted, the plaintiff is bound to establish on trial, that it
was so published or spoken.
Sec. 96. In the action mentioned in the last section, the defendant
may in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defama
tory, and any mitigating circumstances to reduce the amount of damages ;
and whether he proves the justification or not, he may give in evidence
the mitigating' circumstances,
Sec. 97. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained
doing damage, an answer that the defendant or person, by whose command
he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress
was made, and that the property distrained was, at the time, doing
damage thereon, shall be good without setting forth the title to such real
property.
Sec. 98. The plaintiff may ujiite several causes of action in the same
complaint, whether legal or equitable, when they are included in either of
the following classes :
First. The same transaction or transactions connected with the same
subject of action ;
/Second. Contracts express or implied :
Third. Injuries with or without force to person and property, or
either :
Fourth. Injuries to character ; or,
Fifth. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for
withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same ; or,
Sixth. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages
for the withholding thereof;' or,
Seventh. Claims against a trustee by virtue of a contract, or by opera
tion of law. But the causes of action so united, shall belong to one only
of these classes, and affect all the parties to the action, a'"1 vwinfm
different places of trial, and shall be separately stated.
Sec. 99. Every material allegation of the complaint not specifically
controverted by the answer as prescribed, and every material allegation
of new matter in the answer constituting a counter claim not controverted
by the reply as prescribed, shall for the purposes of the action, be taken
as true ; but the allegation of new matter in the answer not relating to a
counter claim or of new matter in a reply is to be deemed controverted
by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may
require.
MISTAKES IN PLEADINGS, AND AMENDMENTS.
Sec. 100. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proof, is material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his
prejudice in maintaining his action or defence upon the merits. When-
ever it is alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the court, and it shall be shown in what respect he
has been misled ; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be
amended upon such terms as may be just.
Sec. 101. "When the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence,
or may order an immediate amendment, without costs.
Sec. 102. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action, or
defence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some particulars
only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of
variance witliin the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
Sec. 103. Any pleading may be once amended by the party, of course,
without costs', and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any
time before the period for answering it expires ; or if it does not delay the
trial, it may be so amended at any time within thirty days after filing of
the answer, demurrer or reply to such pleading; in such case the amended
pleading shall be filed in the proper office and notice thereof served on the
adverse party, who shall have thirty days to answer the same. After the
decision of the demurrer, the court may, in its discretion, if it appears
that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the party demurring,
to withdraw the same, and plead over, or if the demurrer is sustained,
may allow the pleading demurred to, to be amended, on such terms as
may be just.
Sec. 104. The court may, before or after judgment in furtherance of
justice and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process
or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by cor
recting a mistake in the name of a party, a mistake in any other respect,
or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or when the amend
ment does not change substantially the claim or defence, by conforming
the pleading or proceeding to the fact proved.
SkC. 105. The court may likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer
or reply to be made or other act to be done after the time limited by this chapter, or by an order enlarge such time; and may also in its discretion,
at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a
judgment, order, or other proceeding, taken against him, through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, and may supply an
omission in any proceeding. And whenever any proceeding taken by a
party, fails to conform in any respect to the provisions of the statute, the
court may permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it con-
formable thereto ; but this section does not apply to a final judgment in
an action for a divorce.
Sec. 106. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant,
such defendant may be designated in any process, pleading or proceeding
by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the process, pleading
or proceeding may be amended accordingly.
Sec. 107. The court shall in every stage of an action disregard any
error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not affect the
substantial rights of the adverse party, and no judgment can be reversed
or affected by reason of such error or defect.
Sec. 108. The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed
on motion to make a supplemental complaint, answer or reply, alleging
facts material to the case occurring after the former complaint, answer or
reply.
TITLE VII.
CONSOLIDATION AND INTERPLEADING.

for the purpose of compelling one to satisfy a debt due to the other, for
which the plaintiff is bound as surety.

tract or for money, or specific real or personal property, may; at any time
before answer, upon affidavit that a person, not a party to the action and
without collusion with him, makes a demand against him for the same
money, debt, or property, upon due notice to such person, and the adverse
party, apply to the court for an order to substitute such person in his
place, and discharge the defendant from liability to either party, on his
depositing in court the amount of the debt or money, or delivering the
property or its, value, to such person as the court may direct ; and the
court may thereupon make the order, and thereafter the action shall pro
ceed between the plaintiff and person so substituted ; and the court may
compel them to interplead.

Sec. 116. Before such writ is served, a bond shall be executed to the
defendant in an amount double the value of the property, as stated in the
affidavit, conditioned that the action shall be prosecuted with effect for a
return of the property to the defendant, if a return is adjudged, and for
the payment to him of such sum as for any cause may be recovered
against the plaintiff; such bond shall be executed by the plaintiff, or by
some one in his behalf, with two or more sureties to be approved by the

Sec. 123. For the purpose of justification, each surety shall attend
before a judge, court commissioner, or a justice of the peace, at the time

closure denies any indebtedness to, or the possession or control of any
property, money or effects of the defendant, there shall "be no further pro
ceeding, except in the manner following: if the plaintiff in such case
believes that, such garnishee does not answer truly in response to the
questions put to him upon such examination, or that the conveyance

of the defendant, he may, on notice to such garnishee and to the defend
ant at any time before the garnishee has been discharged by the court or
officer, of not less than six days, apply to the court in which the action is
pending or a judge thereof, for permission to file a supplemental com

about to do or is doing, or threatening, or procuring, or suffering some act
to be done in violation of the plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of
the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary
injunction may be granted to restrain such act. And where, during the

principal, together with one or more sufficient sureties to be approved by
said court or judge to the effect that the party applying for the writ will

rights of the applicant would otherwise be prejudiced, nor unless a satis
factory excuse is furnished, showing why the application was not made in
time to allow the same to be heard and determined, upon notice before the
day of sale. In all other cases, if the court or judge deems it proper

^Ec* ^ne property hereinbefore mentioned is not exempt from
any attachment issued in an action for the purchase money of the same
property, op from an execution issued upon any judgment rendered
therein.
Sec. 281. "Whenever any personal property exempt as aforesaid, is
levied upon, seized or sold by virtue of any execution, the damages sus-
tained by the owner thereof by reason of such levy, seizure or sale, and
any judgment recovered therefor shall be exempt from attachment, exe
cution or other proceeding whereby any creditor of said owner seeks to
apply the same to the payment of his debt.
^EC' ^^en tne °fficer holding an execution against any person,
is of the opinion that 6uch person has more property of the classes speci
fied in section two hundred and seventy-nine than is by law exempt, he
may levy on the whole of any one class, and forthwith make an inventory
thereof, and cause the same to be appraised at its cash value by two dis
interested freeholders of the precinct where such property may be, on
oath to be administered by him to such appraisers. If such appraisal ex
ceeds the amount by law exempt of that class, the debtor may thereupon
forthwith select of such property an amount not exceeding in value, as so
appraised, the amount exempt, and the balance shall be held and applied
by said officer as in other cases. If neither the debtor nor his agent
appears and makes such selection, the officer shall make the same. If one
or more indivisible articles of any such class is of greater value than the
whole amount exempt of that class, the officer shall sell the same, and
after paying to the debtor the amount exempt of that class, shall apply
the residue in discharge of his said process.
Sec. 283. A levy may be made upon grain or grass while growing,

in life, and the execution thereof may be completed at any time within
thirty days after such grain, grass, or other unharvested crop is ripe, or fit
to be harvested.
Sec. 284 The sheriff shall exeoute the writ against the property of
tne judgment debtor, by levying on the property, collecting the things in
action, or selling the same, if the court so orders, selling the other pro
perty, and paying to the plaintiff the proceeds, or so much thereof as will
satisfy the execution.
Sec. 285. Before the sale of personal property on execution, notice
thereof shall be given as follows :
— ° . . , , . ., » ,. , , f
irst. By posting written or printed notice of the tune and place of
sale, in three public places of the county where the sale is to take place,
ten days successively.
Second. When real property is sold upon judgment, decree or execu
tion, a similar notice, describing the property with sufficient certainty to
enable a person of common understanding to identify it, shall be posted
for six weeks successively, in three public places of the county where the
property or some part thereof is situated, and a copy thereof shall bo pubr
lished once a week, for the same period, in a newspaper of the county, if

state.
Sec. 286. An officer selling without the notice prescribed by the last section, 6hall forfeit one hundred dollars to the aggrieved party, in addition
to his actual damages ; and a person taking down or defacing the notice
posted, if done before the sale, or the satisfaction of the execution, and
without the consent of the parties, shall forfeit fifty dollars ; but the valid
ity of the sale is not affected by either act, either as to third persons, or
parties to the action.
Sac. 287. A sale shall be made by auction between nine o'clock in
the morning and sunset, in the county where the premises or some part
thereof is situate ; after sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the
execution, no more shall be sold ; neither the officer holding the execution
nor his deputy can purchase ; when the sale is of personal property capa
ble of annual delivery, it shall be within view of those who attend the
sale, and be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price
and when the sale is of real property, and consisting of several known
tracts or parcels, they shall be sold separately, or when a portion of such
real property is claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold
separately, such portion shall be thus sold.
S >:c. 288. Upon the sale of real property where the estate sold is less
than a leasehold of two years unexpired term, the sale is absolute ; in all
other cases the property sold is subject to redemption as provided by
law.
Sec. 289. Whenever any sale of real property is made upon any execution,
or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of a court, (except
where otherwise specified in such judgment, decree or order,) the officer
shall make and deliver to the purchaser a certificate under his hand and
seal containing—
First. A description of the execution, judgment, decree, or order,
uader which such sale is made ;
Second. A description of the real property sold;
Third. The price paid for each parcel sold separately;
Fourth. The date of the sale and name of the purchaser;
Fifth. When subject to redemption it shall be so stated.
Said certificate shall be executed, proved or acknowledged, and recorded
as required by law for the conveyance of real estate, within twenty days
after such sale.
Sec. 290. Such certificate, so proved or acknowledged and recorded,
shall, upon the expiration of the time for redemption, operate as a con-
veyance to the purchaser or his assigns, of all the right, title and interest
of the person whose property is sold, in and to the same, at the date of
the lien upon which the same was sold, without any other conveyance
whatever.
Sec. 291. Real estate sold upon execution, judgment or decree, may
be redeemed—•
First. By the judgment debtor, his heirs or assigns ;
Second. By a creditor having a lien, legal or equitable, on the real
estate or so;ne part thereof, subsequent to that on which the same was
sold. Creditors shall redeem in the order of their respective liens.
Sec. 292. The judgment debtor, his heirs and assigns, may redeem
within one year after the day of sale, by paying to the purchaser the
amount of his bid with interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent,
par an vim, aud if the purchaser is a creditor having a prior lien, the
amount thereof with interest. If no such redemption is made, the senior
creditor may redeem within five days after the expiration of said year,
and each subsequent creditor within five days after the time allowed all
prior lien holders as aforesaid, by paying the amount aforesaid and all
liens prior to his own held by the party from whom such redemption is
made : provided, that no creditor can redeem unless within the year afore
said he files notice of his intention to redeem in the office of the clerk of
the court where the judgment is entered.
Sec. 293. The person desiring to redeem shall pay to the person
holding the right acquired under such sale, or for him to the sheriff, or
clerk of the district court of the county in which such real property is
situated, the amount required by law for such redemption, and shall pro
duce to such person or officer :
First. A certified copy of the docket of the judgment or deed of con
veyance or mortgage, or of the record or files evidencing any other lien
under which he claims the right to redeem, certified by the officer in
whose custody such docket, record, file or files shall be ;
Second. Any assignment necessary to establish his claim, verified by
the affidavit of himself, or of a subscribing witness thereto, or of some
person acquainted with the signature of the assignor ;
Third. An affidavit of himself or his agent, showing the amount then
actually due on his lien.
Sec. 294. The person or officer from whom such redemption is made,
gnan make and deliver to the person redeeming a certificate under his
hand and seal, containing :
First. The name of the person redeeming, and the amount paid by
him on such redemption ;
Second. A description of the sale from which such redemption is made,
and of the property redeemed ;
Third. Stating upon what claim such redemption is made, and if
upon a lien, the amount claimed to be due thereon at the date of redemp
tion.
Such certificate shall be executed and proved or acknowledged and
recorded, as provided by law for conveyance of real estate, and if not so
recorded within ten days after such redemption, such redemption and cer
tificate is void, as against any person in good faith making redemption
from the same person or lien. If such redemption is made by the owner
of the property sold, or his heirs or assigns, such redemption annuls such
Bale ; if by a creditor holding a lien on the property, or some part thereof,
said certificate, so executed and proved or acknowledged and recorded,
operates as an assignment to him of the right acquired under such sale,
subject to such right of any other person to redeem, as is, or may be pro
vided by law.
Sec. 295. The interest acquired upon any sale is subject to the lien
°^ attachment or judgment duly made or docketed against the person
holding the same, as in case of real property ; and may be attached or
sold upon execution, in the same manner.
Sec. 296. Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption,
the court may restrain the commission of waste on the property, by order
granted with or without notice, on application of the purchaser or judg
ment creditor ; but it is not waste for the person in possession of the
property at the time of sale, or entitled to possession afterward, during
the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in the same man
ner in which it was previously used, or to use it in the ordinary course of
husbandry, or to make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon, or to
use wood or timber on the property therefor, or for the repairs of fences,
or for fuel in his family, while he occupies the property.
Sec. 297. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his
successor in interest, is evicted therefrom, in consequence of irregularity
in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of
the judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the judg
ment creditor ; such judgment creditor, if the recovery was in conse
quence of the irregularity, shall thereupon be entitled to a new execution
on the judgment, for the price paid on the sale, with interest ; and for
that purpose the judgment shall he deemed valid against the judgment
debtor, his personal representatives, heirs or 'devisees ; but not against a
purchaser in good faith, or an incumbrancer, whose title or incumbrance
has accrued before a levy on such new execution.
Sec. 298. When property, liable to an execution against several persons,
is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the j udgment i
levied upon the property of one of them, or one of them pays without a
sale, more than his proportion, he may compel contributions from the
others ; and when a judgment is against several, and is upon an obliga
tion of one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays the
amount, or any part thereof, either by sale of his property, or before sale,
he may compel repayment from the principal. In such cases, the person
so paying or contributing, is entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce
contribution or repayment, if within ten days after his payment he
files with the clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered, notice
of his payment, and claim to contribution or repayment ; upon filing such
notice, the clerk shall make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket.
TITLE XXIV.
PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE EXECUTION.
Sec 299. When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to
the sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he does not reside in this
state, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment roll, or a transcript
of a justice's judgment is filed, is returned unsatisfied, in whole or in
part, the judgment creditor is entitled to an order from a judge of the
district court from which the execution was issued, requiring such judg
ment debtor, or if a corporation, any officer thereof, to appear and answer
concerning his or its property, before such judge, or a referee appointed
by him at a time and place specified in the order.
Sec. 300. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment
debtor, as provided in the last section, the judge may upon proof,
by affidavit that there is danger that the debtor will leave the state, or
conceal himself, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where
such debtor is, to arrest him and bring him before such judge ; upon
being brought before the judge he may be examined on oath, and ordered
to give bond with sureties, that he will attend from time to time, before
the judge or referee, as he shall direct, during the pendency of the pro
ceeding, and until the final determination thereof, and will not in the mean
time dispose of any portion of his property, not exempt from execution ;
in default of giving such bond he may be committed to jail by warrant
of the judge, as for a contempt.
Sec 301. After the issuing of execution against property, any person
indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount of his
debts, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execution,
and the sheriff's receipt is a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid.
Sec. 302. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify upon any
proceedings under this chapter, in the same manner as upon the trial of
an issue.
Sec. 303. If the examination is before a referee the testimony and
proceedings shall be certified by him to the judge ; all examinations and
answers before a judge or referee under this chapter, shall be on oath,
except that when a corporation answers, the answer shall be on the oath
of an officer thereof.
Sec. 304. The judge may order any property of the judgment debt
or, not exempt from execution, in the hands either of himself or any
other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied toward the sat
isfaction of the judgment, except that the earnings of the debtor for his
personal services, at any time within thirty days next preceding the order,
can not be so applied, when it appears by the debtor's affidavit, that such
earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly
by his labor.
Sec. 305. The judge may also by order appoint a receiver of the
property of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, or forbid a
transfer or other disposition thereof, or any interference therewith.
Sec. 306. If it appears that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to him, claims an in
terest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or
debt is recoverable only in an action against such person or corporation,
by the receiver ; but the judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other
disposition of such property or interest, till a sufficient opportunity is
given to the receiver to commence the action, and prosecute the same to
judgment and execution ; such order may be modified or vacated by the
judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he may direct.
Sec. 307. If any person, party or witness disobeys an order of the
judge or referee, duly served, such person, party or witness may be pun
ished by the judge, as for a contempt ; the proceedings therefor are pre
scribed in chapter eighty-seven of these statutes, respecting the punishment
of contempt.
Sec. 308. No person shall, on examination pursuant to this chapter,
be excused from answering any question on the ground that his examina
tion will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud ; but his answer
shall not be used as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding or
prosecution.

upon record in the office of the clerk of the court in the county where
such term is to be held, such clerk shall draw and issue a venire for the
number of jurors mentioned in such order.
Sec. 6. At the opening of the court the clerk shall prepare separate
ballots containing the names of the persons summoned as petit jurors,
which shall be folded as nearly alike as possible, and so that the name
cannot be seen, and be deposited in a sufficient box.
Sec. 7. When an indictment is called for trial, and before drawing
the jury, either party may require the names of all the jurors in the
panel to be called, and that an attachment issue against those who are
absent ; but the court may, in its discretion, wait or not, for the return of
the attachment.

the clerk of the court, a demand in writing for such jury, whereupon such
clerk shall forthwith deliver a certified copy of such demand to the sheriff
of the county, who shall give to both parties, four days' notice of the time of
striking the same. At the time designated, said sheriff shall attend at his
office, and in the presence of the parties, or their attorneys, or such of

qualified to serve as jurors within the county, forty such persons as he shall
think most indifferent between the parties, and best qualified to try such

strike for the party not attending. When each party has stricken out
twelve names, as aforesaid, the sheriff shall make a fair copy of the names
of the remaining sixteen persons, and certify the same under his hand to
be the list of jurors struck for the trial of such cause or proceeding, and
shall deliver the same to the clerk, who shall thereupon issue and deliver
to the sheriff or other officer, a venire facias, with the names in said list
contained, annexed thereto ; and such sheriff or other officer, shall summon
the persons named, according to the command of such writ ; and upon the
trial of the cause, the jury so struck shall be called as they stand upon
the panel, and the first twelve of them who shall appear, and are not
challenged for cause, or set aside by the court, shall be the jury, and
shall be sworn to try the issue joined in said cause or proceeding : pro
vided, that if a sufficient number does not appear for the trial of said
cause, the court shall cause talesmen to be called as in other cases.
Sue. 16. If the said sheriff is interested in the cause or proceeding,
or related to either of the parties, or does not stand indifferent between
them, the judge of the said court may name some judicious and disinter
ested person to strike the jury, and to do and perform all things required
to be done by such sheriff, relating to the striking of the same ; but in no
case shall it be necessary to strike such jury more than six days previous
to the term of the court at which the action or proceeding is to be tried,
and three days' service of the venire shall be held sufficient.
Sec. 17. The party requiring such struck jury, shall pay the fees for
diking the same, and the legal fees for mileage and attendance, for each
juror so attending, and shall not have any allowance therefor in the taxa
tion of costs.

and his assistants, when employed, shall be ascertained and allowed by the
court, and the amount thereof, together with the fees allowed by law to the
referees, shall be paid by the plaintiff, and may be allowed as part of the
charges.
Sec. 12. If it is alleged in the complaint, and established by evidence,
that the property or any part of it is so situated that partition cannot be
made without great prejudice to the owners, the court, except as provided
in the next section, may order a sale thereof, and for that purpose may ap
point one or more referees ; or when, without such allegation and proof,
referees are appointed to make partition, who report that the property, or
any distinct portion thereof, is so situated that a partition thereon cannot
be made without great prejudice to the owners, and the court is satisfied
that such report is correct, it may thereupon by an order direct the referees
to sell the property or portions so situated.
Sec. 13. When there are liens on the property amounting to more
than the value thereof as stated in the complaint, or when, after due ex
amination, it appears probable that, the property will not sell for a sum in
cash equal to the amount of the liens thereon existing, with costs and ex
penses of sale, no sale shall be made.
Sec. 14. When the premises consist of a mill or other tenement
wn'ca cannot be divided without damage to the owners, or when any speo
ified part of the estate is of greater value than either party's share and can
not be divided without damage to the owners, the whole estate, or the part
thereof so incapable of division, may be set off to any one of the parties
who will accept it, he paying to any one or more of the others such sums
of money as the referees award to make the partition just and equal, or
the referees may assign the exclusive occupancy and enjoyment of the
whole, or the part, to each of the parties alternately for certain specified
times, in proportion to their respective interests.
Sec. 15. When the whole or any specific part of the premises is thus
assigned, the person entitled for the time being to the exclusive occupancy,
shall be liable to his co-tenants for any injury to the premises, occasioned
by his misconduct, as a tenant for years under a common lease without ex
press covenants would be liable to his landlord ; and the other tenants in
common may have their remedy therefor against him by action, jointly or
severally at their election.
Sec. 16. While an estate is in the exclusive occupancy of a co-tenant
under such an assignment, he shall be entitled to the same remedy against
whoever trespasses upon or otherwise injures the premises as if he held the
same under a lease for the term for which they were so assigned to him ;
and he and all the other tenants in common shall be entitled to recover
such other and furlher damages as they have sustained by the same tres
pass or injury, in like manner as if the premises had been leased by them.
Joint damages recovered by such tenants in common by force of this or
the preceding section, shall be apportioned and divided among them accord
ing to their respective rights, by the court in which the judgment is
recovered.
Sec. 17. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold, if
there is an estate by the curtesy, in dower or for life, or years, in an undi
vided share of the property, the whole of such estate may be set off in any
part of the property not ordered to be sold.
Sec. 18. In every case proof shall be made of the existence, priority
and amount of any liens on the property of which partition is sought, in
such manner and upon such notice to those interested as the court shall
direct, and if said liens do not amount to the value of the premises as ad
mitted or proved, a sale may be ordered by referees under the direction of
the court.
Sec. 19. The proceeds of the sale of the incumbered property shall
De applied, under the direction of the court, as follows :
First. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the action ;
Second. To pay the costs of the reference ;
Third. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens, in their order
of priority, by payment of the sums due, and to become due, the amount
remaining due to be verified by affidavit at the time of payment ;
Fourth. The residue among the owners of the property sold, according
to their respective shares.
Sec. 20. The proceedings, to ascertain the amount of incumbrances,
and to determine their priority, as above provided, or those herein author-
ized to determine the rights of parties to funds paid into court, shall not
delay the sale nor affect any other party whose rights are not involved in
such proceedings.
Sec. 21. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or parcels, belong-
ing to persons who have become parties to the action, and who are known,
are paid into court, the action may be continued as between such parties,
for the determination of their respective claims thereto, which shall be
ascertained and adjudged by the court ; further testimony may be taken
in court, or by a referee, at the discretion of the court, and the court may,
if necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law in contro
versy, by pleadings, as in an original action.
Sec. 22. All sales of real property made by referees under this chapter,
shall be made by public auction to the highest bidder for cash, upon
notice published in the manner required for the sale of real property on
execution ; the notice shall state the terms cf the sale, and if the property,
or any part of it is to be sold subject to a prior estate, charge, or specific
lien, that shall be stated in the notice.
Sec. 23. "When the estate of a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy, or
for life, or years, in the whole or any part of the property in question, has
been admitted by the parties, or ascertained by the court to be existing at
the time of the order for sale, and the person entitled to such estate has
been made a party to the action, such estate may be first set off out of any
part of the property, and a sale made of such parcel, subjoct to the prior
unsold estate of such tenant therein ; but if in the judgment of the court,
a due regard to the interest of all the parties requires that such estate be
also sold, the sale may be so ordered.
Sec. 24. If a sale of the property, including such estate, is ordered,
the estate and interest of every such tenant or person passes thereby ; and
the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall hold the property, discharged
from all claims, by virtue of such estate or interest, whether the same
relate to the individual share of a joint tenant, or tenant in common, or to
the whole, or any part of the property sold.
Sec. 25. The persons entitled to such estate, in dower, tenancy by
curtesy, or tenancy for life, or years, whose estate has been sold, are enti-
tied to receive such sums in gross as may be deemed, upon principles of
law applicable to annuities, a reasonable satisfaction for such estate, and
which the person so entitled may consent to accept instead thereof, by an
instrument under seal duly acknowledged or proved, in the same manner
as deeds for the purpose of record.
Sec. 26. If such consent is not given at or before the report of sale,
the court shall ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds
o" the sale, deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to be
invested for the benefit of the person entitled to such estate in dower, by
the curtesy, or for life, and order the same to be deposited in court for that
purpose.
Sec. 27. The proportions of the proceeds of the sale to be invested,
shall be ascertained and determined in the several cases, as follows :
First. If an estate in dower is included in the order of sale, its proportion
shall be one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the property, or
of the sale of the individual share in such property, upon which the claim
of dower existed ; i
Second. If an estate by the curtesy, or other estate for life, or years,
is included in the order of sale, its proportion shall be the whole proceeds
of the sale of the property, or of the sale of the individual share thereof
in which such estate may be. And in all cases the proportion of the ex
penses of proceedings shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale.
Sec. 28. If the persons entitled to such estate in dower, by the curor
ror or years, are unknown, the court shall provide for the
protection of their rights, in the same manner, as far as may be, as if
they were known and had appeared.
Sec. 29. In all cases of sales in partition, when it appears that a marr'ed
woman has an inchoate right of dower in any of the property, divided
or sold, or that any person has a vested or contingent future right or estate
therein, the court shall ascertain and settle the proportional value of such
inchoate, contingent or vested right or estate, according to the principles
of law applicable to annuities and survivorships, and direct such propor
tion of the proceeds of the sale to be invested, secured or paid over, in such
manner as to protect the rights and interests of the parties.
Sec. 30. A married woman may release such right, interest, or estate
^0 ner husband, and acknowledge the same in the manner required by law,
in respect to the acknowledgment of deeds by married women, before any
officer authorized to take acknowledgment of deeds, or if executed out
of this state, before any officer residing in the state, territory, district or
county, where the acknowledgment is made, who is authorized to take the
acknowledgment of deeds, to be recorded in this state. Upon the release,
the share of the proceeds of the side arii-ing from her contingent interest,
sua^ ue P*^ t0 her husband, and the release, or the payment, investment,
or otherwise securing of a share of the proceeds of a sale, shall be a bar
against such right, estate or claim.
Sec. 31. The terms of the sale shall be made known at the time ; and
^ 'he premises consist of distinct farms or lots, they shall be sold separ
ately.
Sec. 32. Neither of the referees, nor any person for the benefit of
either of them, can be interested in the purchase, nor can a guardian of
.„ ',. , • , f « i b . ■
an infant party be interested in the purchase ot any real property, being
the subject of the action, except for the benefit of the infant. All sales
contrary to the provisions of this section are void.
Sec. 33. After completing the sale, the referees shall report the same
*° t'ie cour^' w'ln a description of the different parcels of land sold to each
purchaser, the name of the purchaser, the price paid or secured, the terms
and conditions of the sale ; the report shall be filed in the office of the
clerk of the district court of the county where the property is situated.
Sec. 34. If the sale is confirmed by the court, an order shall be en-
tered, directing the referees to execute conveyances, which they are authorized
to do ; such order may also give directions to them respecting the
disposition of the proceeds of the sale.
Sec. 35. When a party, entitled to a share of the property, or an
incumbrancer entitled to have his lien paid out of the sale, becomes a
purchaser, the referees may take his receipt for so much of the proceeds
of the sale as belongs to him, and shall also pay over to the plaintiff or
his attorney, and take his receipt for, the costs and charges of the action.
Sec. 36. The conveyance shall be recorded in the county where the
premises are situated, and shall be a bar against all persons interested in
^ pr0perty jn any way, who have been named as parties in the action,
and against all such parties and persons as were unknown, if the summons
has been properly served, and against all persons claiming from them or
cither of them.
Sec. 37. The conveyances shall also be a bar against all persons having
specific or general liens or incumbrances, by judgment, on any undi-
vided share or interest in the premises sold, or who have been served wiih
notice, as prescribed by section eighteen, and also against all persons hav-
ing specific liens of any undivided share or interest therein, who have
been made parties to the action ; but no creditor having such specific lien
can be affected by the sale or conveyance, unless he has been made a
party. ,
Sec. 38. When there are proceeds of sale belonging to an unknown
owner, or to a person without the state, who has no legal representative
within it, or when there are proceeds arising from the sale of an estate
subject to the prior estate of a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy, or ten-
ant for life, or years, which are paid into court or deposited with an officer,
by order of the court, the same shall be invested in securities on interest,
for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto.
Sec. 39. When an investment of any such proceeds is made, it shall
be done, except as herein otherwise provided, in the name of the clerk of
the district court of the county where the papers are filed, and his suc
cessors in office, who shall hold the same for the use and benefit of the
parties interested, subject to the order of the court.
Sec. 40. The clerk by whom an investment is made, and his suecessors
in office, shall receive the interest and principal as it becomes due.
and apply and invest the same as the court may direct ; and shall file in
his office, all securities taken, and keep an account book, provided and
kept for that purpose, in the clerk's office, free for inspection by all per
sons, of investments and moneys received by him thereon, and the dispo
sition thereof.
Sec. 41. When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between
the parties, according to their respective rights, without prejudice
to the rights and interest of some of them, the court may adjudge com-
pensation to be made by one party to another for equality of partition ;
but such compensation cannot be required to be made to others by owners
unknown, nor by infants, unless in case of an infant it appears that he has
personal property sufficient for that purpose, and that his interest will be
promoted thereby.
Sec. 42. When the share of an infant is sold, the proceeds of the sale
may be paid by the referees making the sale, to his general guardian, or
to the special guardian appointed for him in the action, if such general or
special guardian, before the payment of such share into court, has given
the security required by statute.
Sec. 43. The guardian who is entitled to the custody and manage-
ment of the estate of an insane person, or other person, adjudged incapable
of conducting his own affairs, whose interest in real property has been
sold, may receive in behalf of such person his share in the proceeds of
such real property from the referees, if the guardian, before the money is
paid into court, has executed with sufficient sureties, an undertaking ap
proved by the judge of the district court, that he will faithfully discharge
the trust reposed in him, and will render a true and just account to the
person entitled or to his legal representative.
Sec. 44. The general guardian of an infant, and the guardian entitled
to the custody and management of the estate of an insane person, or oth-
er person adjudged incapable of conducting his own affairs, who is entitled
to real estate held in joint tenancy, or in common, or in any other man
ner, to authorize his being made party to an action for the partition thereof,
may consent to a partition without action, and agree upon the share to be
eet off <(to such infant or other person entitled, and may execute a release
in his behalf to the owners of the shares of the parts to which they may
be respectively entitled, upon an order from the court
Sec. 45. The state may be made a party to an action for the sale or
partition of real property, in which case the summons and complaint shall
be served upon the attorney general, who shall appear on behalf of the
state.
Sec. 46. The costs of partition, including fees of referees and other
disbursements, shall be paid by the> parties respectively entitled to share
in the lands divided, in proportion to their respective interests therein,
and may be included and specified in the judgment ; in that case they are
a lien on the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced by exe
cution against the parties separately. Where, however, a litigation arises
between some of the parties only, the court may require the expense of
such litigation to be paid by the parties thereto, or any of them.

an estate or interest therein, adverse to him, for the purpose of determin
ing such adverse claim, estate or interest.
Sec. 2. If the defendant in such action, disclaims in his answer, any
interest or estate in the property, or suffers judgment to be taken against
him without answer, the plaintiff cannot recover costs.
Sec. 3. In an action for the recovery of dower, before admeasure-
ment, or by a tenant in common, or joint tenant of real property, against
a co-tenant, the plaintiff shall show, in addition to the evidence of his
right, that the defendant either denied the plaintiff's right, or did some
act amounting to such denial.
Sec. 4. In an action for the recovery of real property, when the plaintiff
shows a right to recover, at the time the action was commenced, but
it appears that such right has terminated during the pendency of the action,
the verdict and judgment shall be according to the fact, and the
plaintiff may recover damages for withholding the property.
Sec. 5. Any person against whom a judgment for the recovery of
real property is rendered, may within six months after written notice of
the judgment, upon the payment of all costs and damages recovered
thereby, demand another trial, by notice in writing to the adverse party,
or to his attorney in the action, and thereupon the action may be brought
to trial by either party.
Sec. 6. The judgment given on a trial to be had under the last sec-
tion, shall be annexed to the judgment roll of the former trial, and the
judgment last given shall be the final determination of the rights of the
parties. If a prior judgment has been executed, restitution shall be ordered
as the last judgment may determine the rights of the parties, and
the same may be enforced by execution.
Sec. 7. Damages for withholding the property recovered, shall not
exceed the fair value of the property, exclusive of the use of improve-
ments, made by the defendant for a period not exceeding six years ; and
when permanent improvements have been made by a defendant or those
under whom he claims, holding under color of title adversely to the claims
of the plaintiff, in good faith, the value thereof shall be allowed as a set
off against the damages of the plaintiff for the use of the property.
Sec. 8. Any person who erects any building, tenement or fences upon
land, in good faith, and having color of title, and good reason to believe
that the legal title to such lands ia or was vested in him, when, in fact,
such title was or is not in him, and he has no legal or equitable rights
whereby he can enforce a conveyance to him of such title, such person
shall be eutitled to and may remove such buildings, tenements or fences,
from said land, doing no unnecessary damage to the land, and in so doing
shall only be liable for the actual damage done the land : provided, that
no person shall remove a building or fence under the provisions of this section, unless he removes the same within sixty days after the determin
ation of the action or proceeding, respecting the title to the premises on
which such building or fence is erected, as contemplated herein, or within
sixty days after notice to remove the same, given by the holder of thelegal title, unless within said sixty days an action is commenced and pros
ecuted to try such question of title.
Sec. 9. The court in which an action is pending for the recovery of
real property, may on motion, upon notice by either party, and for cause
shown, grant an order allowing to such party the right to enter upon the
property and make survey and measurement thereof for the purpose of
the action.
Sec. 10. The order shall describe the property, and a copy thereof
shall be served on the owner or occupant, and thereupon such party may
enter upon the property with necessary surveyors and assistants, and
make such survey and measurement, but if any unnecessary injury is
done to the property, he is liable therefor.
Sec. 11. A mortage of real property is not to be deemed a convey
ance, so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of
the real property without a foreclosure.
Sec. 12. When real property is sold on execution, the purchaser
thereof, or any person who may have succeeded to his interest, may, after
his estate becomes absolute, recover damages for injury to the property
by the tenant in possession, after the sale, and before possession is deliv
ered under the conveyance.
Sec. 13. An action for the recovery of real property, against a per
son in possession or in receipt of the rents and profits thereof, cannot be
prejudiced by an alienation made by such person, either before or after
the commencement of the action, but in such case if the defendant has no
property sufficient to satisfy the damages recovered for the withholding of
possession, such damages may be collected by action against the purchaser.
Sec. 14. The district court has power to pass the title to real estate
by a judgment, without any other act to be done on the part of the defend
ant, when such appears to be the proper mode to carry its judgments into
effect ; and such judgment being recorded in the registry of deeds of the
county where such real estate is situated, shall, while in force, be as effect
ual to transfer the same, as the deed of the defendant.
Sec. 15. When in case of a lease of real property, and the failure of
the tenant to pay rent, the landlord has a subsisting right to re-enter for
such failure, he may bring an action to recover possession of the property,
and such action is equivalent to a demand of the rent and a re-entry upon
the property ; but if at any time before the expiration of six months after
possession obtained by the plaintiff on recovery in the action, the lessee or
his successor in interest, as to the whole or part of the property, pays to
the plaintiff, or brings into court the amount of rent then in arrear, with
interest and the costs of the action, and performs the other covenants on
the part of the lessee, he may be restored to the possession, and hold the
property according to the terms of the original lease.
Sec. 16. In actions affecting the title to, lien upon, or interest in real
property, the plaintiff, at the time of the commencement of the action, or
at any time afterward, may file for record in the office of the register of
deeds of each county, in which the real property so affected, or some part
thereof is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the
names of the parties, the object of the action, and a description of the
real property in the county affected thereby ; and when the plaintiff
amends his complaint by altering the description of the premises affected
thereby, or so as to extend his claim against the premises, he 6hall file a
new notice. And the register of deeds shall record all such notices in the
same book and in the same manner as mortgages are recorded. From the
time of filing such notice, and from such time only, the pendency of the
action shall be notice to purchasers or incumbrancers of the rights and
equities of the plaintiff to the real property in said notice described.
Sec. 17. If in any such action there are defendants against whom no
personal claim is made, the plaintiff may serve upon such defendanls at
the time of the service of the summons on them, a written noiice, sub
scribed by the plaintiff or his attorney, setting forth the general object of
the action, a description of the property affected by it, and that no personal
claim is made against such defendants. If any such defendant on whom
such notice is so served, unreasonably defends the action, he shall pay full
costs to the plaintiff.
Sec. 18. Every person in possession of land, out of which any rent
is due, whether it was originally demised in fee, or for any other estate of
freehold, or for any term of years, shall be liable for the amount or propor
tion of rent due from the land in his possession, although it is only a part
of what was originally demised.
Sec. 19. Such rent may be recovered in a civil action, and the deed,
demise, or other instrument in writing, if there is any, showing the pro-
visions of the lease, may be used in evidence by either party, to prove the
amount due from the defendant.
Sec. 20. Nothing contained in the two preceding sections shall deprive
landlords of any other legal remedy for the recovery of their rent, whether
secured to them by their lea-es or provided by law.
Sec 21. Estates at will may be determined by either party by three
months' notice in writing for that purpose, given to the other party ; and
when the rent reserved is payable at periods of less than three months,
the time of such notice shall be sufficient if it is equal to the interval be
tween the times of payment ; and in all cases of neglect or refusal to pay
the rent due on a lease at will, fourteen days' notice to quit, given in
writing by the landlord to the tenant, is sufficient to determine the lease.
Sec. 22. Aliens may take, hold, transmit and convey real estate ; and
no title to real estate shall be invalid on account of the alienage of any
former owner.
Sec. 23. A person seized of an estate in remainder or reversion, may
maintain a civil action for any injury done to the inheritance, notwith-
standing an intervening estate for life or years.
Sec. 24. One joint tenant or tenant in common, and his executors or
administrators, may maintain an action against his co-tenant, for receiving
inore than his just proportion of the rents or profits of the estate owned
by them as joint tenants or tenants in common.
Sec. 25. Anything which is injurious to health, or indecent or offen-
sive to the semes, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to
interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance,
and the subject of an action ; such action may be brought by any person
whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is
lessened by the nuisance, and by the judgment, the nuisance may be en
joined or abated, as well as damages recovered.
Sec. 2(5. If a guardian, tenant by the curtesy, in dower, for life, or
years, joint tenant, or tenant in common, of real property, commits waste
thereon, any person injured by the waste may bring an action against him
therefor, iu which action there may be judgment for treble damages, for
feiture of the estate of the party offending, and eviction from the property.
Sec. 27. Judgment of forfeiture and eviction can only be given in
favor of the person entitled to the reversion, against the tenant in posses-
sion, when the injury to the estate in reversion is adjudged in the action
to be equal to the value of the tenant's estate or unexpired term, or to
have been done in malice.
Sec. 28. Whoever cuts down or carries off any wood or underwood,
tree or timber, or girdles, or otherwise injures any tree, timber, or shrub,
on the land of another person, or in the street or highway in front of any
person's house, village or- city lot, or cultivated grounds, or on the com
mons, or public grounds of any city or town, or on the street or highway
in front thereof, without lawful authority, is liable to the owner of such
land, or to such city or town, for treble the amount of damages which may
be assessed therefor, in a civil action in any court having jurisdiction,
except as provided in the next section.
Sec. 29. If upon trial of such action it appears that the trespass was
casual or involuntary, or that the defendant had probable cause to believe
that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own, or that
of the person in whose service, or by whose direction the act was done,
judgment shall be given for only the single damages assessed in the
action.
Sec. 30. Nothing in the last two sections authorizes the recovery of
more than the just value of the timber taken from uncultivated wood land
for the repair of a public highway or bridge upon the land, or adjoining it.
Sec. 31. If a person put out of real property in a forcible manner
without lawful authority, or being so put out, is afterward kept out by
force, recovers damages therefor, judgment may be entered for three times
the amount at which the actual damages are assessed.
Sec. 82. In case of forcible entry or forcible detention, if a person,
claiming in good faith under color of title to be rightfully in possession, so
j, QJ. fept out) recovers damages therefor, judgment may be entered
in his favor for three times the amount at which the actual damages are
assessed.

Sec. 9. Whenever a judgment is obtained against any corporation

them, founded upon such judgment ; and if such decree was rendered in
a proceeding instituted by the attorney general, such creditor may, on his
application, be made complainant therein, and may in like manner make
the directors and stockholders, sought to be charged, defendants in such
action.
Sec. 17. Whenever any creditor of a corporation seeks to charge the
directors, trustee? or other superintending officers of such corporation, or

any 9Ucn account, it appears that such corporation is insolvent, and that it

or the stockholders thereof, are made parties to an action in
which a judgment is rendered, if the property of such corporation is
insufficient to discharge its debts, the court shall proceed to compel each
stockholder to pay in the amount due and remaining unpaid on the shares
of stock held by him, or so much thereof as is necessary to satisfy the
debts of the company.

shall proceed to ascertain the respective liabilities of the directors or other
officers, and of the stockholders, and to adjudge the amount payable by
each, and enforce the judgment as in other cases.
Sec. 23. Whenever any action is brought against any corporation, its
directors or other superintending officers or stockholders, according to the
provisions of this chapter, the court, whenever it appears necessary or
proper, may order notice to be published, in such manner as it shall direct,

dies with the person of either party, except as provided in the next se<?-
tion. All other causes of action, by one against another, whether arising
on contract or not, survive to the personal representatives of the former,
and against the personal representatives of the latter.
Skc. 2. When death is caused by the wrongful act or omission of any
party, the personal representatives of the deceased may maintain an
action, if he might have maintained an action, had he lived, for an injury
caused by the same act or omission ; but the action shall be commenced
within two years after the act or omission, by which the death was caused ;
^ne (jamageg thereon can not exceed five thousand dollars, and the amount
recovered, is to be for the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin,
to be distributed to them in the same proportions, as the personal prop
erty of the deceased person,
Sec. 3. When a judgment is taken against an administrator or execu-
tor Up0n failure to answer, it is not to be deemed evidence of assets in
. . . r . . . , _. „ -, i
his hands, unless it appears that the complaint alleged assets, and was
personally served on him.
Sec. 4. The real property which belonged to a deceased person, is
not DOun<^ or m my way affected by a judgment against his executors or
administrators, nor liable to be sold, by virtue of an execution issued upon
such judgment.
Sec. 5. No person is liable to an action as executor of his own wrong,
for navmg taken, received, or interfered with the property of a deceased
person ; but is responsible to the executor, as general or special adminis
trator of such deceased person, for the value of all property so taken or
received, and for all damages caused by his acts, to the estate of the
deceased.
Sec. 6. Any administrator or executor duly appointed in any other
8tate or country, may commence and prosecute any action in any court of
this state, in his capacity of executor or administrator, in like manner and
under like restrictions as a resident may do ; provided, that before com
mencing any action, an authenticated copy of his appointment as such
executor or administrator is filed in the probate court of the county in
•which such action is to be commenced.
Sec. 7. The next of kin of a deceased person, are liable to an action
ov fl crC(]itor of the estate, to recover the distributive shares received out
of" such estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his debt ;
tile action may be against all the next of kin jointly, or against any one
or more of them.
Skc. 8. In such action, the plaintiff may recover the value of all the
assets received by all the defendants in the action, if necessary to satisfy
his demand ; and the amount of the recovery shall be apportioned among
the defendants, in proportion to the value of the assets received by each ;
and no allowance or deduction can be made from such amount, on account
of there beinjr other relatives to whom assets have also been delivered.
Sec. 9. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a recovery is had
pursuant to the last section, may maintain an action against all the other
relatives of the testator, to whom any such assets have been paid jointly,
or any one or more of them, for a just and equal contribution, and may
recover of each defendant such amount as bears the same proportion to
the whole sum collected of the plaintiff, as the value of the assets deliv
ered to such defendant bears to the value of all the assets delivered to all
the relations of the deceased.
Sec. 10. Legatees are liable to an action by a creditor of the testator,
t0 recover the value of a legacy received by them. The action may be
brought against all, or any one or more of the legatees. In such action,
the plaintiff cannot recover unless he shows :
First. That no assets were delivered by the executor or administrator
of the deceased, to his heirs or next of kin ; or,
Second. That the value of such assets has been recovered by some
other creditor ; or,
Third. That such assets are not sufficient to satisfy the demands of the
plaintiff ; and in the last case he can recover only the deficiency.
The whole amount which the plaintiff can recover, shall be apportioned
among all the legatees of the testator, in proportion to the amount of their
legacies respectively, and his proportion can only be recovered of each
legatee.
Sec. 11. If an action is brought against several next of kin jointly,
or against several legatees jointly, for assets delivered to them, and a recovery
had against them, the costs of such action shall be apportioned
among the several defendants, in proportion to the amount of the damages
recovered against each of them.
Sec. 12. In case of a judgment against several next of kin of a testator,
or against several legatees, the payment on satisfaction of the amount re-
covered against any one of the defendants, discharges such defendant, and
exonerates him and his property from the judgment.
Sec. 13. Heirs and devisees are liable to an action by a creditor of a
deceased person, to recover the debt, to the extent of the value of any real
property inherited by, or devised to them; if such action is against the
heirs, all the heirs who are liable shall be made parties to the action.
Sec. 14. But the heirs are not liable for the debt, unless it appears
that the personal assets of the deceased were not sufficient to discharge it,
or that after due proceedings before the probate court, the creditor is un
able to collect the debt, from the personal representatives of the deceased,
or from his next of kin, or legatee ; if the personal assets were sufficient
to pay a part of the debt, or in case a part thereof has been collected, as
mentioned in the last section, the heirs of such deceased person are liable
for the residue.
Sec. 15. But the last section does not affect the liability of heirs for a
debt, of their ancestors, where such debt was by his will expressly charged
exclusively on the real property descended to such heirs, or where such
debt is by the will expressly directed to be paid out of the real property
descended before resorting to the personal property.
Sec. 1 6. When the heirs, devisees or legatees have received real or
personal estate, and are liable for any debts under the provisions of law,
they shall be liable in proportion to the estate they may have respectively
received ; and a creditor shall have a right to recover his claim against a
part or all of such heirs, devisees or legatees, to the amount of the estate
they have respectively received r but no action shall be maintained un
less commenced within one year from the time the claim is allowed or
established.
Sec. 17. If by the will of the deceased any part of his estate, or any
devisees or legatees shall be made exclusively liable for the debt, the devisees
or legatees shall be liable to contribute among themselves [only]
according to the will.
Sec. 18. If all the persons liable for the payment of any such debt,
shall not be included in the action as defendants, the action shall not thereby
be in any way dismissed or barred, but the court before which it is
pending may order any other parties brought in, by any proper process,
and may allow such amendments as may be necessary to make them de
fendants, on such terms as the court shall prescribe.
Sec. 19. If more than one person is liable as aforesaid, and the creditor
brings an action against all or a part of the persons so liable, and the
persons liable dispute the debt or the amount claimed, the district court
may order an issue to be formed, and direct that the amount may be ascer
tained by a jury, and said court shall ascertain and determine how much
each is liable to pay, and may award execution therefor.
Sec. 20. If any of the heirs, devisees or legatees, dies without having
big juaj 8Uare of the debts, his estate shall be liable therefor, as for
his own debt, to the extent to which he would have been liable, if liv
ing.
Sec. 21. When any of the heirs, devisees or legatees, pays more than
his share of such debt, the other persons liable shall be holden and com
pelled to contribute their just proportion of the same.
Sec. 22. In cases where the next of kin, legatees, heirs and devisees
016 liable for the debts of their ancestors, as herein provided, they shall
give preference in the payment of the same, and are liable therefor, in the
following order :
First. Debts entitled to a preference under the laws of the United
States;
Second. Judgments against the ancestor or testator, according to the
priority thereof, respectively ;
Third. Debts due to other creditors.
Sec. 23. No preference can be given by any next of kin, legatee, heir,
or devisee, to one debt over another of the same class, except one specified
in the second sub-division of the last section ; nor is a debt, due and pay
able, entitled to a preference over a debt not due ; nor does the commence
ment of an action against any next of kin, legatee, heir, or devisee, for
the recovery of a debt, entitle it to preference over others of the same
class.
Sec. 24. The next of kin, legatees, heirs and devisees may show that
there are debts of a prior class, unsatisfied; or that there are unpaid debts
of the same class with that on which the action is brought ; and if it ap
pears that the value of the personal property delivered to them, or of the
real estate descended or devised to them, does not exceed the debts of a
prior class, judgment shall be rendered in their favor,
Sec. 25. If the personal property delivered to such next of kin or leg-
atee, or if the real estate, descended or devised to such heir, and devisee,
exceeds the amount of debts which are entitled to a preference over the
debt for which the action is brought, judgment shall be rendered against
them only for suth a sum as bears a just proportion to the other debts of
the same class with that on which the action is brought.
Sec. 26. If debt of a class prior to that on which the action is brought,
or of the same class, is paid by any next of kin, legatees, heirs, or devi
sees, they may prove such payment, and the amount of the debt so paid
shall be estimated in ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same
manner as if such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the
last two sections.
Sec. 27. If it appears that the real property so descended was not
a];enate(j Dy the heir at the time of the commencement of the action, or if
the heir confesses the claims and shows what real property has descended
to him, the court shall order that the debt of the plaintiff, or the propor
tion thereof which he is entitled to recover, be levied of the real property
80 descended, and not otherwise ; and every judgment rendered in such
action has preference as a lien on the real property so descended, to any
judgment obtained against such heir personally for a debt on demand in
his own right.
Sec. 28. When it appears in the action, that before the commencement
thereof, the heir has aliened the real property descended to him, or
any part thereof, he shall be personally liable for the value of the property
so aliened, and judgment may be rendered therefor, and execution award
ed, as in actions for his own debts. But no real property, aliened in good
faith by an heir, before action commenced against him, is liable to execu
tion, or in any manner affected by a judgment against him.
Sec. 29. In actions brought against several heirs jointly, or several
devisees jointly, the amount, which the plaintiff recovers, shall be appor-
tioned among all the heirs of the ancestor, or among all the devisees of
the testator, in proportion to the value of the real property descended or
devised, and such proportion only can be recovered of each heir or leg
atee.
Sec. 30. Devisees made liable, by the foregoing provisions of this chapter, to the creditor of their testator, are not so liable, unless it appears
that his personal assets, and the real property of the testator descended to
his heirs, were insufficient to discharge the debt ; or unless it appears that
after due proceedings before the probate court, the creditor has been un
able to recover the debt, or any part thereof, from the personal represent
atives of the testator, or from his next of kin, or legatees, or from his
heirs.
Sect. 31. In either of the cases specified in the last section, the
amount of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the real property
descended to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, and the amount which such
plaintiff may have failed to recover from the personal representatives of
the testator, his next of kin, legatees and heirs, may be recovered of
the devisees of such testator, to the extent of the real property devised
to them respectively.
Sec. 32. But the last two sections do not affect the liability of dc-
visees, for a debt of their testator, where such debt was, by his will, expressly
charged exclusively upon the real property devised, or by the
terms of the will made payable exclusively by such devisee, or made
payable out of the real property devised, before resorting to the personal
property, or to any other real property descended or devised.
Sec. 33. The provisions of this chapter, with regard to heirs, and to
proceedings by and against them, and to judgments and executions against
them, are applicable to actions and proceedings against devisees, and
they must in like manner be jointly sued.
Sec. 34. In cases where, by the provisions of any statute, a child, born
after the making of a will, is entitled to succeed to a portion of the testa-
tor's real and personal property, such child shall have the same rights and
remedies to compel a distribution of the personal property, and a partition
of the real property, as are provided for next of kin, and for heirs, and
shall in all respects be liable in the same manner, and to the same extent,
to the creditors of his ancestor, in respect to the personal property deliv
ered to him, and the real property descended to him, as is herein pre
scribed in relation to the next of kin, and heirs, and such child may
recover of the legatees and devisees who may have received or taken any
real or personal property of the testator, the share or portion thereof to
■which he may be entitled.
Sec. 35. The provisions of the last two sections, relative to a child
born after the making of a will, apply equally to every person, who being
a witness to a will, is entitled, by the provisions of any statute, to
recover a portion of the real or personal property of the testator from the
legatees and devisees named in such will.
Section 1. The official bond or other security of a public officer to
the state or any municipal body or corporation, whether with or without
sureties, is to be construed as security to all persons severally, for the
official delinquencies against which it is intended to provide, as well as
to the state, body or corporation designated therein: provided, that
when no other provision is made by law, it shall run to the state of
Minnesota.
Sec. 2. "When a public officer, by official misconduct or neglect, for
feits his official bond, or renders his sureties liable upon an official security,
any person injured thereby, or who is by law entitled to the benefit of the
security, may bring an action thereon, in his own name, against the officer
and his sureties, to recover the amount to which he is entitled by reason
of the delinquency.
Sec. 3. Before an 'action can be brought by a plaintiff", other than
the state or body politic named in the bond, leave shall be obtained of
the district court, or a judge thereof, within the county where the action
is triable, by the production of a copy of the bond, and an affidavit show
ing the delinquency, and if the delinquency is such, that if established on
the trial, it would entitle the party applying to recover in the action, leave
shall be granted.
Sec. 4. A judgment in favor of a party for one delinquency, does
not preclude the same or another party, from an action on the same secu
rity for another delinquency.
Sec. 5. Upon the execution issued on a judgment, recovered upon
the official security of a public officer, against him and a surety, there
shall be indorsed a direction to the officer to whom the execution is de
livered, to collect the same out of the property of the principal, if suffi
cient can be found, and if not, then to collect it out of the property of
the surety.
Sec. 6. Actions for fines and forfeitures, may be prosecuted by the
officers or persons to whom they are by law given, or who, by special
provisions of law, are authorized to recover them ; and whether prose
cuted by public officers or by private persons, are governed by the same
rules as other civil actions, except as herein otherwise prescribed.
Sec. 7. "When an action is brought for a penalty, which is limited by
law, not to exceed a certain amount, the action may be brought for that
amount, and upon trial, the amount recovered shall be determined in
proportion to the offence.
Sec. 8. A recovery of a judgment, for a penalty or forfeiture, by
collusion between the parties, with intent to save the defendant from the
consequences contemplated by law, in case where the penalty or forfeiture
is given wholly or partly to the prosecutor, does not prevent the recovery
of the same by another person.
Sec. 9. Fines and forfeitures, . not specially granted or appropriated
by law, shall be paid into the treasury of the state ; and whenever any
property, real or personal, is forfeited to the state, or to any officer, for
its use, an action for the recovery of such property, alleging the grounds
of the forfeiture, may be brought by the proper officer, in the district
court of any county where such property may be.
Sec. 10. All fines and forfeitures imposed as a punishment for any
offense, or for the violation or neglect of any duty imposed by statute,
may be prosecuted for and recovered by indictment in the district court ;
or when the amount or value thereof does not exceed one hundred dollars,
the same may be prosecuted for by complaint before a justice of the
peace, who shall have jurisdiction therefor concurrently with the district
court, and in all cases of the imposition of a fine pursuant to statute, aa
punishment for any offense, the offender may be committed till the same
is paid, or he is otherwise discharged according to law.

Sec. 3. An action may be brought by the attorney general in the

to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine not ex
ceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, upon every such officer or member
of such body or board ; such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the
state treasury, and the payment of such fine is a bar to an action for any
penalty incurred by such officer, or member of such body or board, by
reason of liis refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.

court has exclusive original jurisdiction, and in such case the supreme
court or a judge thereof shall first make a rule, returnable in term, that
such district court, or judge thereof, show cause before the court why a
peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue, and upon the return day
of such rule such district court, or judge, may show cause against the rule
by affidavit or record evidence, and upon the hearing thereof the supreme
court shall award a peremptory writ or dismiss the rule. In case of emer
gency a judge of the supreme court at the time of making the rule to

court> an<i 8na^ 06 applied for upon affidavit, by motion to the court, or a
judge thereof in vacation, and if the cause shown, appears to the court or
judge to be sufficient, a writ shall be thereupon issued, which shall com
mand the court and party, or officer to whom it is directed, to desist and
refrain from any further proceedings in the action or matter specified there
in, until the next term of said supreme court, or the further order of the
court thereon ; and to show cause at the next term of said court, or some

term time, why they should not be absolutely restrained from any further
proceedings in such action or matter.

to whom it is directed, in the same manner as a writ of mandamus ; and a
return shall be made thereto by such court or officer, which may be enforced
by attachment.
Sec. 16. If the party to whom such writ is directed, shall, by an
instrument in writing, to be signed by him and annexed to such return,
adopt the same return, and rely upon the matters therein contained, as
sufficient cause why such court should not be restrained, as mentioned in
said writ, such party shall thenceforth be deemed the defendant in such
proceeding, and the person prosecuting such writ may take issue, or demur
to the matters so relied upon by such defendant.
Sec. 17. If the party to whom such writ is directed, shall not adopt
Bucn return> tne Party prosecuting such writ, shall bring on the argument
of such return, as upon a rule to show cause ; and he may, by bis own

parties, shall render judgment, either that a prohibition absolute, restrain

thereof, as may be deemed just.
Sec. 19. If the party to whom such first writ of prohibition is directed,
adopts the return of the court thereto, and judgment is rendered for
the party prosecuting such writ, a prohibition absolute shall be issued, but
if judgment is given against such party, a writ of consultation shall be
issued as above provided.

specified in the preceding twenty-first section.

any criminal offense, or if he appears, by the testimony offered with the
return, upon the hearing thereof, to be guilty of such an offense, although

shall proceed to let such party to bail, if the case is bailable, and good
bail is offered, or if not, shall forthwith remand such party.

person legally entitled thereto, or, if no one is so entitled, he shall be dis-

aid of said writ.
Sec. 42. The party brought before any such officer, on the return of
nny wr*' °^ haDeas corpus, may deny any of the material facts set forth
in the return, or allege any fact to show either that his imprisonment or
detention is unlawful, or that he is entitled to his discharge, which allega
tions or denials shall be on oath ; and thereupon such officer shall proceed
in a summary way, to hear such allegations and proofs as are legally pro
duced in support of such imprisonment 'or detention, or against the same,
and to dispose of such party as justice requires.
Sec. 43. Whenever from the sickness or infirmity of the perron directe<^

without danger, be brought before the officer before whom the writ is
made returnable, the party in whose custody he is, may state the fact in
his return to the writ, verifying the same by his oath ; and if such officer
is satisfied of the truth of such allegation, and the return is otherwise
sufficient, he shall proceed to decide upon such return, and to dispose of
the matter ; and if it appears that the person detained, is illegally impris
oned, confined, or restrained of his liberty, the officer shall order those
having such person in their custody, to discharge him forthwith ; and if it
appears that such person is legally detained, imprisoned, or confined, and
is not entitled to be bailed, such officer shall dismiss the proceedings.

person entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, whether a writ has been issued
r .. , i i ,•
or not, transfers such prisoner to the custody or places lnm under the
power or control of another person, or conceals him, or changes the place
of his confinement with intent to elude the service of such writ, or to
avoid the effect thereof, the person so offending shall forfeit to the party
aggrieved thereby the sum of four hundred dollars, to be recovered in a
civil action.
Sec. 47. Any officer or other person refusing to deliver a copy of any

bringing up such prisoner. The officer granting the writ may in his dis
cretion require a bond in a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars,
with sufficient sureties, conditioned that the obligors will pay all costs and
expenses of the proceeding and the reasonable charges of restoring the
prisoner to the person from whose custody he was taken, if he is re
manded. Such bond shall run to the sheriff of the county and be filed
in the office of the clerk of the court from which the writ issues.
Sec. 50. Every writ of habeas corpus issued pursuant to this chapter,
may be served by delivering the same to the person to whom it is directed ;
if he cannot be found it may be served by being left at the jail, or other
place in which the prisoner is confined, with any under officer or other
person of proper age having charge, for the time, of such prisoner.
Sec. 51. If the person on whom the writ ought to be served conceals
himself, or refuses admittance to the party attempting to serve the same,
it may be served by affixing the same in some conspicuous place on the
outside, either of his dwelling house or of the place where the party is
confiued.
Sec. 52. If the writ is returnable at a certain day, such return shall
be made, and such prisoner produced at the time and place specified there-
in ; if it is returnable forthwith, and the place is within twenty miles of
the place of service, such return shall be made, and such prisoner pro
duced within twenty-four hours ; and the like time shall be allowed for
every additional twenty miles.
Sec. 53. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to restrain
the power of any court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, when
necessary to bring before them any prisoner for trial, in any criminal case
lawfully pending in the same court, or to bring any prisoner to be ex
amined as a witness in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending
in such court, when they think the personal attendance and examination
of the witness necessary for the attainment of justice.
Section 1. Every mortgage of real estate, containing therein a power
of sale, upon default being made in any condition of such mortgage, may

an(l to make such foreclosure, it is requisite:
First. That some default in a condition of such mortgage has occurred
by which the power to sell has become operative ;
Second. That no action or proceeding has been instituted at law, to
recover the debt then remaining secured by such mortgage, or any part
thereof ; or if the action or proceeding has been instituted, that the same
has been discontinued, or that an execution upon the judgment rendered
therein has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part ; and,
Third. That the mortgage containing such power of sale has been duly
recorded, and if it has been assigned, that all the assignments thereof have
been recorded.
Sec. 3. When a mortgage is given to secure the payment of money
by installments, each of the installments, either of principal or interest,
mentioned in such mortgage, may be taken and deemed to be a separate
independent mortgage ; and such mortgage for each of such install
ments, may be foreclosed in the same manner, and with the like effect, as
if such separate mortgage was given for each of such subsequent install
ments, and a redemption of any such sale by the mortgagor shall have the
like effect as if the sale for such installments had been made upon an inde
pendent prior mortgage.
Sec. 4. In such case if the mortgaged premises consist of separate and
distinct farms or tracts, only such tract, or tracts, shall be sold as are suffito
satisfy the installment or installments then due, with interest and
costs of sale, but if said premises do not consist of such separate and dis
tinct farms or tracts, the whole shall be sold, and in either case the pro
ceeds of such sale shall, after satisfying the interest, portion or installment
of the principal due, with interest and costs of sale, be applied toward
the payment of the residue of the sum secured by said mortgage, and not
due and payable at the time of such sale, and, if such residue does not
bear interest, such application shall be made with a rebate of the legal in
terest for the time during which such residue shall not be due and payable,
and the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the mortgagor, his legal represent
atives or assigns.
Sec. 5. Notice that such mortgage will be foreclosed by sale of the
mortgaged premises, or some part of them, shall be given by publishing
the same for six successive weeks, at least once in each week, in a newspaper
printed and published in the county where the premises intended to
be sold, or some part thereof, are situated, if there is one, if not, then in
a newspaper printed and published at the capital of the state. In the lat
ter case, a copy of such notice shall be served, at least four weeks before
the time of such sale, on the person in possession of the mortgaged prem
ises, if the same are occupied, but when they are not occupied, and the
mortgagor, his heirs or personal representatives reside in the county where
such premises lie, then on such mortgagor, his heirs or personal represent
atives, as the case may be ; proof of such service may be made, certified
and recorded, in the same manner and with like effect as proof of the pub
lication of a notice of sale under a mortgage.
Sec. 6. Every notice shall specify :
First. The names of the mortgagor and of the mortgagee, and the
assignee, if any; "
Second. The date of the mortgage, and when recorded ;
Third. The amount claimed to be due thereon, and taxes, if any,
paid by the mortgagee, at the date of the notice ;

tially to that contained in the mortgage ; and,

party requesting such postponement.
Sec. 9. If the mortgaged premises consist of separate and distinct
farms, or tracts, they shall be sold separately, and no more farms or tracts,

person or officer :

other judicial proceeding ;

ance, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial, or other judicial pro

in an action or special proceeding contrary to law, after such action or
special proceeding is removed from the jurisdiction of such inferior tribu

of a judicial officer, is also a contempt of the authority of such officer.
Sec. 2. Every court of justice, and every judicial officer, has power
- *^ pUn^jj contempts, by fines or imprisonment, or both ; but when the con
tempt is one of those mentioned in the first or second sub-divisions of the

tion or special proceeding, was defeated or prejudiced thereby, before the
contempt can be punished by imprisonment, or by a fine exceeding fifty
dollars.
Sec. 8. When a contempt is committed in the immediate presence of
^e court» or officer, it may be punished summarily, for which an order shall
be made, reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view and pres
ence, adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby guilty of a
contempt, and that he be punished as therein described. Such punish
ment, however, cannot exceed that prescribed by section twelve ; where
the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the
court, an affidavit or other evidence shall be presented to the court or offi
cer of the facts constituting the contempt.
Sec. 4. In cases other than those mentioned in the last section, the court
or officer may either issue a warrant of arrest, to bring the person charged,
to answer, or without a previous arrest may, upon notice, or upon an order,
to show cause, which may be served by a sheriff or other officer, in the
same manner as a summons in an action, grant a warrant of commitment,
impose a fine, or both, not exceeding the punishment prescribed by section
twelve, and make such order thereupon as the case may require,
Sec. 5. If the party charged is in the custody of an officer by virtue
°f a order or process, civil or criminal, except upon a sentence for
felony, an order may be made for the production of such person, by the
officer having him in custody, that he may answer, and he shall thereupon
be produced and held until an order is made for his disposal.
Sec. 6. Whenever a warrant of arrest is issued pursuant to this chapter>
tne court or officer shall direct whether the person charged may be let
to bail for his appearance upon the warrant, or detained in custody with
out bail ; and if he may be bailed, the amount in which he may be let to
bail. The directions given in this respect shall be specified in the war
rant.
Sec. 7. Upon executing the warrant of arrest, the sheriff shall keep
the person in actual custody, bring him before the court or officer, and de
tain him until an order is made in the premises, unless the person arrested

rested to bail, he shall be discharged from the arrest, upon executing and
delivering to the officer, at any time before the return day of the warrant,
a recognizance with two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the person
arrested will appear on the return of the warrant, and abide the order of
the court or officer thereupon, or pay, as may be directed, the sum specified
in the warrant.
Sec. 9. The officer shall return the warrant of arrest, and the recognizance,
if any received by him from the person arrested, by the return
day specified therein. If he fails to make the return, a warrant of arrest,
nQt Daiiabie> may be issued against him, specifying therein the cause of
issuing it.
Sec. 10. The officer to whom the warrant mentioned in the last sec-
**on 19 delivered, shall execute it by arresting the person proceeded against,
bringing him personally before the court or officer, and detaining him in
custody until otherwise ordered.
S E 0 ■ 11. When the person arrested has been brought up or appeared,
the court or officer shall proceed to investigate the charge, by examining
him and the witnesses tor and against him, for which an adjournment may
be had from time to time, if necessary.
Sec. 12. Upon the evidence so taken, the court or officer shall determine
whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the contempt
charged, and if it is adjudged that he is guilty of the contempt, a fine shall
be imposed upon him, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, or he
be imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both. But in the discretion of
the court or officer, (in case of inability to pay the fine, or endure the im
prisonment,) he may be relieved in such manner and upon such terms as
maybe just.
Sec. 13. If an actual loss or injury to a party in an action or special
proceeding, prejudicial to his right therein, is caused by the contempt, the
court or officer, in addition to the fine or imprisonment imposed for the
contempt, may order the person proceeded against to pay the party ag
grieved a sum of money sufficient to indemnify him, and to satisfy his
costs and expenses ; which order, and the acceptance of money under it,
is a bar to an action by the aggrieved party for such loss and injury.
Sec. 14. When the contempt consists in the omission to perform an
act which is yet in the power of the person to perform, he may be impris-
oned until he performs it ; and in that case the act shall be specified in the
warrant of commitment.
Sec. 15. Persons proceeded against, according to the provisions of this chapter, are also liable to indictment for the same misconduct, if it is an
indictable offense, but the court before which a conviction is had on the
indictment, in passing sentence, shall take into consideration the punish-
ment before inflicted.
Sec. 16. When the warrant of arrest has been returned served,if the
person arrested does not appear on the return day, the court or officer may
issue another warrant of arrest, or may order the recognizance to be pros-
ecuted, or both. If the recognizance is prosecuted, the measure of damages
in the .action is the extent of the loss or injury sustained by the
aggrieved party, by reason of the misconduct for which the warrant was
issued, and the costs of the proceedings.
Sec. 17. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an officer is
required to keep a person arrested in actual custody, and to bring him be-
fore a court or officer, the inability, from illness or otherwise, of the person
to attend, is a sufficient excuse for not bringing him up.

mora^ character, and who possesses the requisite qualifications of learning
ability, is entitled to admission to practice in all the courts of this
state.

court or any district court when in session, and shall show first, that he is

may be proved by certificate or other evidence satisfactory to the court.
Sec. 3. The applicant shall also be examined in open court, as to his
qualifications of learning and ability, by the judges, or under their direc
tion, at the term at which application for admission is made.

to practice as an attorney and counsellor in all the courts of this state ;
and upon the entry of the order, he is entitled to practice as such attorney
and counsellor.
Sec. 5. It is the duty of any attorney and counsellor :
First. To support the constitution and laws of the United States, and
of this state ;
Second. To maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and
judicial officers ;
Third. To counsel or maintain such actions, proceedings or defences,
only, as appear to him legal and just, except the defence of a person
charged with a public offense ;
Fourth. To employ, for the purpose of maintaining the cause confided
to him, such means only as are consistent with truth, and never to seek to
mislead the judges by any artifice or false statement of fact or law ;
Fifth. To maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril to him
self to preserve the secrets of his client ;
Sixth. To abstain from all offensive personality and to advance no fact

of an action or proceeding from any motive of passion or interest ; and,
Eighth. Never to reject, for any consideration personal to himself, the
cause of the defenceless or oppressed.
Sec. 6. An attorney or counsellor who is guilty of deceit or collusion,
or consents thereto, with intent to deceive a court or judge, or a party to
an action or judicial proceeding, is punishable for a misdemeanor, and
shall also forfeit to the party injured, treble damages, recoverable in a
civil action.
Sec. 7. If an attorney and counsellor knowingly permits a person not
his general law partner to sue out process, or to prosecute or defend an
action or proceeding in his name, he and every person who so uses his
name, shall severally forfeit to the party against whom the process was
issued, or the action or proceeding prosecuted or defended, the sum of
fifty dollars, recoverable in a civil action.

supreme or district court, to maintain or defend the same, unless previously
admitted to practice, as herein provided.
Sec. 9. An attorney and counsellor has authority :
First. To bind his client in any of the proceedings in an action or
special proceeding by his agreement duly made or entered upon the
minutes of the court ; but such agreement or stipulation shall be disre

the same is alleged, or his attorney ;
Second. To receive money claimed by his client in an action or special
proceeding during the pendency thereof, or within two years after judg
ment, and upon the payment thereof, and not otherwise, to discharge the
claim or acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment.
But this section does not prevent a party employing a new attorney to
issue an execution upon a judgment, or to take other proceedings pre
scribed by the statute for its enforcement ; and when he does so, the
authority of the former attorney ceases.
Sec. 10. If it is alleged by a party for -whom an attorney appears,
that he does so without authority, the court may at any stage of the pro-
ceedings relieve the party for whom the attorney has assumed to appear
from the consequences of his acts ; it may also summarily, upon motion,
compel the attorney to repair the injury to either party consequent upon
his assumption of authority.
Sec. 11. The court or a judge may, on motion of either party, and
on showing reasonable grounds therefor, require the attorney for the

to appear.

of the appearance of the party in person shall be given to the adverse
party ; until then, he is bound to recognize the former attorney,
Sec. 14. When an attorney dies, or is removed, or suspended, or
cea=es to act as such, a party to an action for whom he was acting as

furnished, is placed in the hands of the owner of any building or vessel,

owner.
Sec 10. If the person erecting as owner, any building described in

release said lien ; and if such person having received satisfaction as afore
said, by himself or attorney, or judgment having been rendered against
him as aforesaid, shall not within ten days after request in writing, lodge
