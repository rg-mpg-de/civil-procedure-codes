ing, must show to what part it is responsive. It is the duty of

from.
6. An express admission of a fact is not necessary to render

belief that an adverse party, whose pleading has been verified by
a person other than himself, knows that a statement thereof, in
the affidavit mentioned, is untrue, and that the motion is not
made for delay, the court, if such statement be material, shall
require such adverse party to verify the pleading; and, if he fail
to do so, within a reasonable time, shall treat it, with regard to
him, as if it had not been filed.
5. Verification of a pleading does not make other or greater
proof necessary on the side of the adverse party than would have

defendant must state whether or not he claims it, or any part of
it ; and, if he claim part of it, his answer must so describe such
part that it may be identified. The making of such statement,
or of such statement and description, shall not, of itself, throw
on the defendant the burthen of proving his right to the land
claimed by him ; but, if the plaintiff recover any part thereof,
the defendant shall pay the costs of the action.
§ 126 [153]. Material allegations taken as true—exceptions to
rule. Every material allegation of a pleading must, for the purposes

? 139. Court may allow amendment without verification.
§ 129 [156]. Variance between pleadings and proof—what
deemed material. No variance between pleadings and proof is
material, which does not mislead a party, to his prejudice, in main-
taining his action or defense upon the merits. A party who claims to
have been so misled must show that fact to the satisfaction of the
court ; and, thereupon, the court may order the pleading to be
amended, upon such terms as may be just.
§ 130 [157]. Fact to be found according to evidence, and
pleadings amended. If such variance be not material, the court
may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence, and may
order an immediate amendment.
§ 131 [158]. When variance deemed a failure of proof. If,
however, the allegation of the claim or defense, to which the proof
is directed, be unproved, not in some particular or particulars only,
but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of
variance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
Amendment of March 24,1888: § 1. That section 131 of the
Civil Code of Practice be amended by adding thereto the follow
ing words, to-wit : "In an action on a contract alleged to have
been made by several defendants, in the event the evidence shall
show the contract to have been made with less than all those
defendants by whom it is alleged to have been made, this shall
not be deemed either a variance or failure of proof, but judg
ment may be rendered against the party or parties shown to be
bound and in favor of those shown not to be bound."
§ 132 [159]. Plaintiff may amend without leave before
answer. The plaintiff may, at any time before answer, amend his
petition without leave; but, unless the amendment be tiled five days
before the term at which the defendant is summoned to answer, he
6hall give to the defendant notice, of one day, of his intention to
amend. (Mai/ be filed in vacation to rare, defect, sec. 109—2).

court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms
as may be proper, cause or permit a pleading or proceeding to be
amended, by adding or striking out the name of a party ; or, by cor
recting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; or, by inserting other allegations material to the case; or, if
the amendments do not change substantially the claim or defense, by
conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. And, if
a proceeding taking by a party fail to conform in any respect to the
provisions of this Code, the court may permit an amendment of such
proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto. And, if the alle
gations of a pleading be so indefinite or uncertain that the precise
nature of the claim or defense is not apparent, the court may require
the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment. The
court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect
in the proceedings, which does not affect the substantial rights of the
adverse party ; and no judgment shall be reversed or affected by rea
son of such error or defect. {Party in. fault must pay cost of, sec. US- -5 ;
antendment of affidavit for attachment, sec. 86'8—-'.)
§ 135 [162]. Supplemental pleading allowed. A party may
be allowed, on motion, to file a supplemental pleading, alleging
material facts occurring after the filing of the former pleading; but
if a plaintiff, having a lien for a debt due and a debt not due upon
property which he seeks to subject, state both claims in his petition,
he may, upon a suggestion of record that one of them has become
due, pendente lite, have judgment for a sale of the property therefor.
§ 136 [163]. Continuance on amendment. If a party amend a
pleading or proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit or
otherwise, that the adverse party can not be ready for trial in conse
quence thereof, a continuance may be granted to some day in the
same term or to another term of the court.
§ 137 [164]. Verification of petition before trial. A petition
filed without verification shall not be dismissed for that reason, if the
verification be made on or before the calling of the action for trial.
§ 138 [165]. Verification not necessary after trial begins. (No
objection shall be taken, after the commencement of the trial, to any
pleading for the want of, or a defect in, the verification. \
§ 1 39 [1 66] . Court may allow amendment without verification.
Courts may, in their discretion, permit the amendments authorized by
this chapter to be made without being verified, unless a new and dis
tinct cause of action or defense be thereby introduced.

person for whose life such life estate is held by the trustee, to dis
pose by a last will and testament, or by an instrument in the nature

such court by such life-tenant, it shall be the duty of the court
to appoint a receiver, who shall take possession of such land and
