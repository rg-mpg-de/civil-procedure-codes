by them or their Attorneys, as the Case may be, leave the Decision
of any Issue of Fact to the Court, provided that the Court, upon a
Rule to show Cause, or a Judge on Summons, shall, in .their or his
Discretion, think fit to allow such Trial ; or provided the Judges of
the Superior Courts of Law at Westminster shall, in pursuance of the
Power herein-after given to them, make any, General Rule or Order
dispensing with such Allowance, either in all Cases or in any particular
Class or Classes of Cases to be defined in such Rule or Order ;
and such Issue of Fact may thereupon be tried and determined, and
Damages assessed where necessary, in open Court, either in Term or
Vacation, by any Judge who might otherwise have presided at the
Trial thereof by Jury, either with or without the Assistance of any
other Judge or Judges of the same Court, or included in the same
Commission at the Assizes ; and the Verdict of such Judge or Judges
shall be of the same Effect as the Verdict of a Jury, save that it
shall not be questioned upon the Ground of being against the Weight
of Evidence; and the Proceedings upon and after such Trial, as to the
Power of the Court or Judge, the Evidence, and otherwise, shall be
the same as in the Case of Trial by Jury.
SEC. 2. It shall be lawful for any One of the Judges of any of the
Superior Courts at Westminster, at the Request of the Lord Chief
Justice or Lord Chief Baron, to try the Causes entered for Trial at
Nisi Prius in Westminster and London in either of the Courts, on the
same Days on which the said Lord Chief Justice or Lord Chief Baron,
or any other Judge of the same Court, shall be sitting to try Causes
at those Places respectively, or at either of them, so that the Trial of
Two Causes may be proceeded with at the same Time ; and all
Jurors, Witnesses, and other Persons who may have been summoned
or required to attend at or for the Trial of any Cause before the said
Lord Chief Justice or Lord Chief Baron, as the Case may be, shall
give their Attendance at and for the Trial thereof before such other
Judge as may be sitting to try the same by virtue of this Act ; and it

Justice or Lord Chief Baron, as the Case may be, to appoint from
Time to Time fit and proper Persons, to be approved by the. said
Lord Chief Justice or Lord Chief Baron, to attend for them and on
their Behalf respectively before such Judge ; and the Trial of every
Cause which shall be so had by virtue of this Act shall, if
necessary, be entered of Record, as having been had before the
Judge by whom such Cause in fact was tried.
SEC. 3. If it be made appear, at any Time after the issuing of the

tried in the ordinary Way, it shall be lawful for such Court or Judge,
upon such Application, if they or he think fit, to decide such Matter
in a summary Manner, or to order that such Matter, either wholly or
in part, be referred to an Arbitrator appointed by the Parties, or
'to an Officer of the Court, or, in Country Causes, to the Judge of
any County Court, upon such Terms as to Costs and otherwise
as such Court or Judge shall think reasonable ; and the Decision or
Order of such Court or Judge, or the Award or Certificate of such

depends, upon a Question of Law fit to be decided by the Court, or
upon a Question of Fact fit to be decided by a Jury, or by a Judge
upon the Consent of, both Parties as herein-before provided, it shall
be lawful for such Court or Judge to direct a Case to be stated,
or an Issue or Issues to be tried ; and the Decision of the Court
upon such Case, and the Finding of the Jury or Judge upon such
Issue or Issues, shall be taken and acted upon by the Arbitrator
as conclusive.
SEC. 5. It shall be lawful for the Arbitrator upon any compul- sory Reference under this Act, or upon any Reference by Consent of Parties where the Submission is or may be made a Rule or Order of any of the Superior Courts of Law or Equity at Westminster, if he
shall think fit, and if it is not provided to the contrary, to state his
Award, as to the whole or any Part thereof, in the Form of a Special,
Case for the Opinion of the Court, and when an Action is referred,
Judgment, if so ordered, may be entered according to the Opinion of
the Court.
SEC. 6. If upon the Trial of any Issue of Fact by a- Judge under
this Act it shall appear to the Judge that the Questions arising

tried before him, it shall be lawful for him, at his Discretion, to order
that such Matter of Account be referred to an Arbitrator appointed
by the Parties, or to an Officer of the Court, or, in Country Causes,
to a Judge of any County Court, upon such Terms as to Costs, and
otherwise, as such Judge shall think reasonable ; and the Award or
Certificate of such Referee shall have the same Effect as herein-before
provided as to the Award or Certificate of -a Referee before Trial and it shall be competent for the Judge to proceed to try and dispose
of any other Matters in question, not referred, in like Manner as if no
Reference had been made.
SEC. 7. The Proceedings upon any such Arbitration as aforesaid shall,
except otherwise directed hereby or by the Submission or Document
authorizing the Reference, be conducted in like Manner, and subject
to the same Rules and Enactments, as to the Power of the Arbitrator

Documents, enforcing or setting aside the Award, and otherwise, asupon
a Reference made by Consent under a Rule of Court or Judge's
Order.
SEC. 8. In any Case where Reference shall be made to Arbitration as aforesaid the Court or a Judge shall have Power at any Time, and
from Time to Time, to remit the Matters referred, or any or either
of them, to the Re-consideration and Re-determination of the said

said Court or Judge may seem proper.

Reference under this Act shall and- may be made within the
First Seven Days of the Term next following the Publication of the
Award to the Parties, whether made in Vacation or Term ; and if no

Rule granted thereon is afterwards discharged, such Award shall be
final between the Parties.
SEC. 10. Any Award made on a compulsory Reference under this Act
may, by Authority of a Judge, on such Terms as to him may seem
reasonable, be enforced at any Time after Seven Days from the
Time of Publication, notwithstanding that the Time for moving to
set it aside has not elapsed.

to be hereafter made or executed, or any of them, shall agree that any
then existing or future Differences between them or any of them shall
be referred to Arbitration, and any One or more of the Parties so
agreeing, or any Person or Persons claiming through or under him or
them, shall nevertheless commence any Action at Law or Suit in
Equity against the other Party or Parties, or any of them, or against
any Person or Persons claiming through or under him or them in
respect of the- Matters so agreed to be referred, or any of them, it
shall be lawful for the Court in which Action or Suit is brought, or
a Judge thereof, on Application by the Defendant or Defendants, or

such Agreement as aforesaid, and that the Defendant was at the
Time of the bringing of such Action or Suit and still is ready and
willing to join and concur in all Acts necessary and proper for causing,
such Matters so to be decided by Arbitration, to make a Rule or
Order staying all Proceedings in such Action or Suit, on such Terms
as to Costs and otherwise as to such Court or Judge may seem fit :

be discharged or varied as Justice may require.
SEC. 12. If in any Case of Arbitration the Document authorizing the
Reference provide that the Reference shall be to a single Arbitrator,
and all the Parties do not, after Differences have arisen, concur in
the Appointment of an Arbitrator ; or if any appointed Arbitrator

a new one ; or if, where the Parties or Two Arbitrators are at liberty
to appoint an Umpire or Third Arbitrator, such Parties or Arbitrators
do not appoint an Umpire or Third Arbitrator ; or if any appointed
Umpire or Third Arbitrator refuse to act, or become incapable of
acting, or die, and the Terms of the Document authorizing the Reference
do not show that it was intended that such a Vacancy should
not be supplied; and the Parties or Arbitrators respectively do not
appoint a new one.; then in every such Instance any Party may
serve the remaining Parties or the Arbitrators, as the Case may be,
with a . written Notice to appoint an Arbitrator, Umpire, or Third
Arbitrator respectively; and if within Seven clear Days after such
Notice shall have been served no Arbitrator, Umpire, or Third Arbitrator
be appointed, it shall be lawful for any Judge of any of the
Superior Courts of Law or Equity at Westminster, upon Summons to
be taken out by the Party having served such Notice as aforesaid,
to appoint an Arbitrator, Umpire, or Third Arbitrator, as the Case

unless the Document authorizing the Reference show that it was
intended that the Vacancy should not be supplied ; and if on such a
Reference One Party fail to appoint an Arbitrator, either originally or
by way of Substitution as aforesaid, for Seven clear Days after the
other Party shall have,appointed an Arbitrator, and shall have served
the Party so failing to appoint with Notice in Writing to make the_
Appointment, the Party who has appointed an Arbitrator may
appoint such Arbitrator to act as sole Arbitrator in the Reference,
and an Award made by him shall be binding on both Parties as if the
Appointment had been by Consent ; provided, however, that the
Court or a Judge may revoke such Appointment, on such Terms as
shall seem just.
SEC. 14. When the Reference is to Two Arbitrators, and the Terms of the Document authorizing it do not show that it was intended that there should not be an Umpire, or provide otherwise for the Appointment of an Umpire, the Two Arbitrators may appoint
an Umpire at any rime within the Period during which they have
Power to make an Award, unless they be called upon by Notice
as aforesaid to make the Appointment sooner.

compulsory Order of Reference as aforesaid, or under any Order
referring the Award back, shall make his Award under his Hand,

been appointed, and shall have entered on the Reference, or shall
have been called upon to act by a Notice in Writing from any Party,
but the Parties may by Consent in Writing enlarge the Term for
making the Award'; and it shall be lawful for the Superior Court
of which such Submission, Document, or Order is or may be made
Rule or Order, or for any Judge thereof, for good Cause to be
stated in the Rule or Order for Enlargement, from Time to Time
to enlarge the Term for making the Award ; and if no Period be
stated for the Enlargement in such Consent or Order for Enlargement,
it shall be deemed to be an Enlargement for One Month ; and
in any Case where an Umpire shall have been appointed it shall be
lawful for him to enter on the Reference in lieu of the Arbitrators,
if the latter shall have allowed their Time or their extended Time
to expire without making an Award, or shall have delivered to any
Party or to the Umpire a Notice in Writing stating that they
cannot agree.
SEC. 16. When any Award made on any such Submission, Doculiver
ment, or Order of Reference as aforesaid directs that Possession of
any Lands or Tenements capable of being the Subject of an Action
of Ejectment shall be delivered to any Party, either forthwith o
at any future Time, or that any such Party is entitled to the Possesin
sion of any such Lands- or Tenements, it, shall be lawful for the Court
of which the Document authorizing the Reference is or is made a
Rule or Order to order any Party to the Reference who shall be in

possession of the same claiming under or put in possession by him
since the making of the Document authorizing the Reference, to
deliver Possession of the same to the Party entitled thereto, pursuant

ment or Submission it is provided that the same shall or may be made
