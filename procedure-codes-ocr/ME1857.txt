SEC. 5. If after breach of the condition, the mortgagee, or

holding possession of the premises, he may proceed for the pur
pose of foreclosure in either of the following modes:
Fim.—He may give public notice in a newspaper printed in
the county where the premises are situated, if any, or if not, in
the state paper, three weeks successively, of his claim by mort
gage on such real estate, describing the premises intelligibly, and
naming the date of the mortgage, and that the condition in it is
broken, by reason whereof he claims a foreclosure; and cause a
copy of such printed notice, and the name and date of the news
paper in which it was last published, to be recorded in each reg
istry of deeds in which the mortgage deed is or by law ought to
be recorded, within thirty days after such last publication.
Second.—-He may cause an attested copy of such notice to be
served on the mortgagor or his assignee, if he lives in this state,
by the sheriff or his deputy of the same county, by delivering it
to him in hand or leaving it at his place of last and usual abode;
and cause the original notice and the sheriff ’s return thereon to
be recorded within thirty days after such service as aforesaid;
and in all cases the certiﬁcate of the register of deeds shall be
prima facie evidence of the fact of such entry, notice, publication
of foreclosure, and of the sheriff’s return.

redeem the mortgaged premises within three years next after

is entitled to the possession of the premises for breach of the

party, award the conditional judgment hereinafter mentioned,
