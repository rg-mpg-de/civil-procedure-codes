reasonable diligence, be ascertained by him, and such fact he
made to appear by afhdavit to the court, or to a judge thereof,
or to the county judge of the county where the trial is to be had,
such court, judge, or county judge may grant an order that the
stunmons be served on such unknown party or parties by publishing the same for six weeks, once in each week successively, in
the State paper and in a newspaper printed in the county where
the premises are situated, which publication shall be equivalent
to a personal service on such party or parties.

them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows:
1. Ifthe action be against defendants jointly indebted u on

contract, he may proceed against the defendant served, un ess

the court otherwise direct; and if he recover judgment, it may
be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so
far only as that it may be enforced against the joint property
of all, and the separate property of the defendants served, and
if they are subject to arrest, against the persons of the defendants served; or,

2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he
may proceed against the defendants served in the same manner
as if they were the only defendants.

 If all the defendants have been served, judgment may be
taken against any or either of them severally, when the plantiff
would be entitled to judgment against such defendant or defendants if the action had been against them or any of them
alone.

4. If the name of one or more parties shall, for any cause,
have been omitted in any action in which judgment shall have
passed against the defendants named in the summons, and such
omission shall not have been pleaded in such action, the plaintiff, in case the judgment. therein remain unsatisfied, may by
action recover of such partner separately, upon proving his
joint liability, notwithstanding he may not have been named
in the original action; but the plaintiff shall have satisfaction of
only one judgment rendered for the same cause of action.

SEC. 88. In the cases mentioned ' in section 86 the service of the summons shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time
prescribed by the order of publication.

SEC. 69. Proof of the. service of the summons, and of the complaint or
notice, if any, accompanyino the same, must be as follows:

1. If served by the sherid‘, his certificate thereof; or,

2. If by any other person, his aiiidavit thereof; or, .

:3. In case ()1 publication, the atiidavit of the printer, or his
foreman, or principal clerk, showing the same, and an aiiidavit of
a deposit of a copy of the summons in the post ofice, as required bylaw, if the same shall have been deposited; or,

4. The Written admission of the defendant. _

In case of service, otherwise than by publication, the certificate, aflidavit, or admission must state the time and place of
service. ~

Sec. 90. From the time of the service of the summons in a civil action,
or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court is deemed

to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all the
subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

claim, or connected with the subject of the action.

2. In an action arising on contract, any other cause of action
arising also on contract-, and existing at the commencement of
the action. 9

The defendant may set forth, by answer, as many defenses
and counter-claims as he may have, whether they be such as
have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both.
They must each be separately stated, and refer to the causes of
action which they are intended to answer, in such manner that
they may be intelligibly distinguished. ‘

SEC. 102. Sham and irrelevant answers and defenses may be stricken
out, on motion, and upon such terms as the court may in Its d1scretion impose.

SEC. 103. When the answer contains new matter constituting a counterclaim, the plaintiif may, within twenty days, reply to such new
matter, denying ‘generally or specially each allegation controverted by him, or any knowledge or information thereof sufli—
cient to form a belief; and he may allege, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, any new matter not inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a defense to such new matter in the answer; a11d the plaintiff may, in all cases, demur to an
answer containing new matter, where upon its face it does not
constitute a counter-claim or defense; and the plaintiff may demur to one or more of such defenses or counter-claims, and reply
to the residue of the c/ounter-claims. And in other cases where
an answer contains new matter constituting a defense by way of
avoidance, the court may, in its discretion, on the defendant’s
motion, require a reply to such new matter; and in that case the
rpply shall be subject to the same rules as a reply to a counterc aim.

SEC. 104. If the answer contains a statement of new matter constiqiting ,

a counter-claim, and the plaintiff fail to reply or demur thereto
within the time prescribed by law, the defendant may move, on
a notice of not less than ten days, for such judgment as he is entitled to upon such statement, and, if the case require it, a writ
of inquiry of damages may be issued.

SEC. 105. If a reply of the plaintiff to. any defense set up by the answer
of the defendant be insufficient, the defendant may demur thereto, and shall state the grotmds thereof.

SEC. 106. Every answer, amended complaint, or reply, in a court of record, must be subscribed by the party or h1s attorney, and verified as provided in the next section. '

SEC. 107. The verification must be to the effect that the same is true to
the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those matters stated on information and belief, and as to those matters he
believes it to be true, and must be by the aflidavit sf the party,
or, if there be several parties united in interest and pleading together, by one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts,
if such party be within the county where the attorney resides
and capable of making the afljdavit.

The affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the

action or defense be founded upon a written instrument for the .

payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession
of the agent or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the
pleading be within the present knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the pleading is verified by any other person than
the party, he shall set forth in the afiidavit his knowledge or the
grounds of his belief on the subject, and the reasons why it is
not made by the party. ' VVhen a corporation is a party, the
verification may be made by any officer thereof; and when the
State or any oflicer thereof in its behalf is a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with the facts.
The verification may be omitted whe11 an admission of the truth
of the allegation might subject the party to prosecution for felony; and no pleading can be used iii a crlminal prosecution
against the party as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such
pleading.

SEC. 108. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading"
the items of an account therein alleged, but he shall deliver tothe adverse party, Within ten days after a demand thereof, in

writing, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading is verified,

must be verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent or attorney,,

to the effect that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from
giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a
county judge, may order a further account when the one delivered is defective, and the judge may in all cases order a bill of
particulars of the claim of either party to be furnished.

SEC. 109. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a
view ‘of substantial justice between the parties. '

SEC. 110. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it
may be stricken out, on motion of any person so aggrieved thereby, and when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or
uncertain that the precise nature of the charge or defense is not

apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite
and certain by amendment.

SEC. 111. In pleading a judgment, or other determination of a court’
or oflicer of special jurisdiction, it.shall not be necessary to state
the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment’ or determi.nation may be stated to have been duly given or made. -If such

allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound -toestablish, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.

SEC. 112. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent, in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing suchperformance ; but it may be stated generally that the party duly
performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation
be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish,
on trial, the facts showing such performance. In an action or
defense founded upon an instrument for the payment of money
only, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a copy of the in, strument, and to state that there is due to him thereon, from the

adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims.

SEC. 113. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it
shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title, and the day

of its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice
thereof.

SEC. 114. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to
state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of
showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter
out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufiicient
to state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning the laintiif, and if such allegation be controverted the
plaintiff sha be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so pub'shed or spoken. '

SEC. 115. In the actions inentioned in the last section, the defendant
may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the
amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification or
not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

SEC. 116. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained
doing damage, an answer that the defendant, or person by whose
command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property
upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at that time doing damage thereon, shall be good,
without setting forth the title to such real property.

SEC. 117. The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several causes
of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all arise out of,

1. The same transaction, or transactions connected with the
same subject of action;

-3. Contract, express or implied; or,

35. Injuries, with or without force, to person or property, or
cit her; or,

4. Injuries to character ; or,

5. Claims to recover real property, with or Without damages,
for the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same;
or,

6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages, for ‘the withholding thereof; or,

7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of_a contract, or by operation of law. But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one of
these classes, except in actions for the -foreclosure of mortgages,
and must affect all the parties to the action, and not require
different places of trial, and must be separately stated. In actions to foreclose mortgages, the court shall have power to adjud e and direct the payment, by the mortgagor, of any residue
of t e mortgage debt that may remain due and unsatisfied after
a sale of the mortgaged prennses. In cases in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the debt secured by such
mortgage, a11d 1f the mortgage debt be secured by the covenant
or obligation of any person other than the mortgagor, the plaintiff may make such person a party to the action, and the eourt
may adjudge payment of the residue of such debt remaining due
and unsatisfied, after the sale of the mortgaged premises, ag:1ins_,t

such other person, and may enforce such judgment as in other

cases.

SEC. 118. Every material allegation of the complaint, not controverted
by the answer, as prescribed in section 100, and every material
allegation of new matter in the answer, constituting a set-off or
counter-claim, not controverted by the reply, as prescribed in section 103, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true.
But the allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating to
a set-off or counter-claim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be
deemed controverted by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require.

SEC. 119. No variance between the allegation in a pleading a11d the
proof shall be deemed material, unless it shall have actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action
or defense, upon the merits. Wheneve1' it shall be alleged that
a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled, and
thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended,
upon such terms as shall be just.

SEC. 120. VVhere the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the
evidence, or may order an lmmedlate amendment, Without costs.

SEC. 121. Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defense to which the proof is directed is unproved, not . in some
particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning,
it shall not be deemed a case of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

SEC. 122. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course,
without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already
had," at any time within twenty days after it is served, or at any
time before the period expires for answering it ; or it can be so
amended at any time within twenty days after the service of the
answer or demurrer to such pleading, unless it be made to appear
to the court that it was done for the purposes of delay, and the
plaintiff or defendant will thereby lose the benefit of a term for
which the cause is, or may be, noticed; and if it appear to the
court that such amendment was made for such purpose, the
same may be stricken out and such terms imposed as to the

court may seem just. I11 such case a copy of the amended plead- ing must be served on the adverse party. After the decision of
a demurrer, either at a general or special term, the court may,
in its discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was interposed
in good faith, allow the party to plead over on such terms as
may be just. If the demurrer be allowed for the cause mentioned
in the fifth subdivision of section 95, the court ma *, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, order the action to be
divided into as many actions as may be necessary to the proper
determination of the causes ofaction therein mentioned.

SEC. 123. The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance of
justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process, or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party,
or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment does not
change substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the
pleading and proceeding to the facts proved.

SEC. 124. The court may likewise, in its discretion, and upon such terms
as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other
act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or by an order

enlarge such time; and may also, in its discretion, and upon
such terms as may be just, at any time within one y-ear after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, or other
proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence,

surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission in a

any proceeding; and whenever any proceeding taken by a party
fails to conform in any respect to the provisions of this Code, the
court may in like manner, and upon like terms, permit an
amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable
thereto. '

SEC. 125. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name ; and When his true name shall be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

SEC. 126. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any error
or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not affect
the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment
shall be reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.

SEC. 127. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on
motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer, orpreply, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the former complaint, answer, or reply, or'of which the party was ignorant when
his former pleading was made, and either party may, by leave
of the court, in any pending or future action, set up, by a supplemental pleading, the judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction rendered since the commencement of such action, determining the matters in controversy in said action or
any part thereof, and if said judgment be set up by the plaintiff,
the same shall be without prejudice to any provisional remedy
theretofore issued or other proceedings had in said action in his

* behalf:

case such service may be made ‘by publication, or in such other
manner as the court shall direct. Such leave shall not be given,
unless it be established by the oath of the party, or other satisfactory proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, remains
unsatisded and due. But the leave shall not be necessary When
execution has been issued on the judgment Within the five years,
and returned unsatisfied in Whole or in part. When judgment

the day when the judgment was docketed in the county, or at
any time thereafter.

personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real
property, or trustees, it shall require the oflicer to satisfy the

judgment out of such property.

3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it shall
require the ofiicer to arrest such debtor and commit him to the

jail of the county until he shall pay the judgment, or be discharged according to law. _

4. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal
property, it shall require the oflicer to deliver the possession of
the same, particularly describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require the officer to satisfy any
costs, damages, or rents and profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it

SEC. 236. When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or of any one of the several debtors in the same juclgment, issued to the sheriff’ of the county where he resides or has
a place of business, or, if he do not reside in the State, to the
sheriff of the county where a judgment roll or a transcript of a
justice’s judgment for twenty-five dollars or upwards, exclusive
of costs, is filed, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the
judgment creditor, at any time after such return made, is entitled to an order from a judge of the circuit court, or a county
judge of the county to which the execution was issued, requiring
such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property before such judge, at a time and place specified in the order,
within the county to which the execution was issued.

2. After the issuing of an execution against property, and
upon proof by aliidavit, of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the judge of the circuit court, or county judge, that any
judgment debtor, residing in the county Where such judge resides,
has property not exempt from execution, which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such
judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear
at a specified time and place to answer concerning the same;
and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application
of the pro crty of the judgment debtor towards the satisfaction
of the ju gment as is provided upon the return of an execution.

 On an examination under this section, either party may examine witnesses in his behalf, and the judgment debtor may be
examined in the same manner as a Witness.

4. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may, upon proof by aflidavit or otherwise,
to his satisfaction, that there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the
State, or concealing himself, and that there is reason to believe
that he has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to such
judgment, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county
where such debtor may be, within his jurisdiction, to arrest him
and bring him before such judge. _ Upon being brought before the

. judge he may be examined on oath, and, if it then appears that
there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the State, and that he has
property which he unjustly refused to apply to such judgment,
ordered to enter into an undertaking, With one or more sureties,
that he Will, from time to time, attend before the judge as he
shall direct, and that he will not, during the pendency of the
proceedings, dispose of any portion of his property’ not exempt
from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking,
he may be committed to prison by warrant of the judge, as for
a contempt.

5. No person shall, on examination pursuant to this chapter,
‘be excused from answering any question on the ground that his
examination will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud;
but his answer shall not be used as evidence against him in any
criminal proceedings or prosecutions. Nor shall he be excused
from answering any question on the ground that he has, before
the examination, executed any conve _ance, assignment, or transfer of his property for any purpose, ut his answer shall not be
used as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution.

SEC. 237. After the issuing of execution against property, any person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount
of his debt, or so much thereof as shall be necessary to satisfy
the execution; and the sherili"s receipt shall be a suliicient discharge. for the amount so paid.

SEC. 238. After the issuing or return of an execution against property
of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the
same judgment, and upon an ailidavit that any person or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted
to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, the judge may, by
an order, require such person or corporation, or any oflicer or
member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place and answer concerning the same. The judge may also, in his discretion, require notice of such proceeding to be given to any party
in the action, in such manner as may seem to him proper.

The proceedings mentioned in this section, and in section 258,
may be taken upon the return of an execution unsatisfied, issued
upon a judgment recovered in an action a ainst joint debtors,
in which some of the defendants have not een served with the
summons by which said action was commenced, so far as relates
to the joint property of such debtors; and all actions by creditors, to obtain satisfaction of judgments out of the property of
joint debtors, are maintainable in like manner and to the like
effect. These provisions shall apply to all proceedings and actions now pending, and not actually terminated by any final
judgment or decree.

SEC. 239. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify on any proceedings under this chapter, in the same manner as upon the trial

not exempt from execution, in the hands either of himself or of
any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied
towardsthe satisfaction of the judgment, except that the earnings
of the debtor for his personal services, at any time Within sixty
days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied when it is
made to appear, by the debtor’s afrldavit or otherwise, that such
earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly
or partly by his labor.

SEC. 242. The judge may also, by order, appoint a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor in the same manner and with the
like authority as if the appointment was made according to section 192. '

whether any other su plementary proceedings are pending
against the judgment ebtor, and if such proceedings are so
’ ending, the plaintiff therein shall have notice to appear before

‘In, and shall likewise have notice of all subsequent proceedings
in relation to said receivership. No more than one receiver of
the property of a judgment debtor shall be appointed. The
judge may also, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition
of the property of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, and any interference therewith.

Whenever the judge shall grant an order for the appointment
of a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor, the same
shall be filed in the oiiice of the clerk of the county where the
judgment roll in the action, or transcript from justice’s judgment,
upon which the proceedings are taken, is filed ; and the said
clerk shall record the order in a book to be kept for that purpose

in his oflice, to be called “ book of orders appointin receivers of
judgment debtors,” and shall note the time of the ling of said
order therein. A certified copy of said order shall be delivered
to the receiver named therein, and he shall be vested with the
property and effects of the judgment debtor from the time of the
filing and recording of the order as aforesaid. The receiver of
the judgment debtor shall be subject to the direction and control of the court in which the judgment was obtained upon
which the proceedings are founded; or if the judgment is
upon a transcript from justice’s court, filed in the county
clerk’s oflice, then he shall be subject to the direction and
control of the county court. But before he shall be vested
with any real property of such judgment debtor, a certilied copy of said order shall also be filed and recorded in the
ofdce of the clerk of the county in which any real estate of such

judgment debtor, sought to be effected by such order, is situated, '

and also in the oflice of the clerk of the county in which such
judgment debtor resides.

SEC. 243. If it appear that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an action against such
person or corporation by the receiver; but the judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest, till a suliicient opportunity be given to the receiver to
commence the action, and prosecute the same to judgment and
execution; but such order may be modified or dissolved by the
judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he
shall direct.

SEC. 244. The judge may, in his discretion, order a reference to a referee agreed upon by the parties, or appointed by him, to report
the evidence or the facts, and may, in his discretion, appoint
such referee in the first order, or at any time.
