the names of such heirs or devisees, or any of them, and their residence, are
unknown to the plaintiff, proceedings may be had against such unknown heirs
or devisees, without naming them; and the court shall make such order respect
ing service as may be deemed proper. If service by publication be ordered,
the publication shall not be less than three weeks. 
§ 79. Where the action is against
two or more defendants, and one or more shall have been served, but not ail of
them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows: First, If the action be against de
fendants jointly indebted upon contract, he may proceed against the defendants
served, unless the court otherwise direct; and if he recover judgment, it may be
entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it
may be enforced against the joint property of all, and the separate property of
the defendants served; and if they are subject to arrest, against the persons of
the defendants served. Second, If the action be against defendants severally
liable, he may, without prejudice to las rights against those not served, proceed
against the defendants served in the same manner as if they were the only de
fendants.
§ 80. Nothing in this
code shall be so construed as to make a judgment, against one or more defend
ants jointly or severally liable, a bar to another action against those not served.

§ 81. When the petition has been filed,
the action is pending, so as to charge third persons with notice of its pendency,
and while pending no interest can be acquired by third persons in the subject
matter thereof as against the plaintiff's title; but such notice shall be of no avail
unless the summons be served or the first publication made within sixty days
after the filing of the petition. 

§ 82. When any part of real prop
erty, the subject matter of an action, is situated in any other county or counties
than the one in which the action is brought, a certified copy of the judgment in
such action must be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of such other
county or counties, before it shall operate therein as notice, so as to charge third
persons, as provided in the preceding section. It shall operate as such notice,
without record, in the county where it is rendered. 

§ 83. The plaintiff may unite several causes
of action in the same petition, whether they be such as have heretofore been
denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all arise out of either one
of the following classes: First, The same transaction, or transactions, connected
with the same subject of action. Second, Contracts, express or implied. Third,
Injuries, with or without force, to person and property, or either. Fourth, In
juries to character. Fifth, Claims to recover the possession of personal prop
erty, with or without damages for the withholding thereof. Sixth, Claims to
recover real property, with or without damages for the withholding thereof, and
the rents and profits of the same. Seventh, Claims against a trustee, by virtue
of a contract, or by operation of law. But the causes of action so united must
all belong to one of these classes, and must affect all the parties to the action,
except in actions to enforce mortgages or other liens. 

§ 84. The pleadings are the written sta.aments,
by the parties, of the facts constituting their respective claims and d ■•
fenses. 

§ 85. The rules of pleading heretofore ex
isting in civil actions are abolished; and hereafter, the forms of pleadings in
civil actions in courts of record, and the rules by which their sufficiency may be
determined, are those prescribed by this code. 

§ 86. The only pleadings allowed are:
First, The petition by the plaintiff. Second, The answer or demurrer by the
defendant. Third, The demurrer or reply by the plaintiff. Fourth, The de
murrer bv the defendant to the reply of the plaintiff. 

§ 87. The petition must contain:
First. The name of the court, and the county in which the action is brought,
and the names of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, followed by the word
"petition."
econd, A statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary
and concise language, and without repetition.
Third, A demand of the relief to which the party supposes, himself entitled.
If the recovery of money be demanded, the amount thereof shall be stated; and,
if interest thereon be claimed, the time from which interest is to be computed
shall be also stated. 

§ 88. Where the petition con
tains more than one cause of action, each shall be separately stated and num
bered. 

§ 89. The defendant may demur to thipetition
only when it appears on its face, either: First, That the court has nc
jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, or the subject of the action. Second,
That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue. Third, That there is anothei
action pending between the same parties for the same cause. Fourth, Thai
there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant. Fifth, That several causes
or action are improperly joined. Sixth, That the petition does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 

§ 90. The demurrer shall specify dis
tinctly the grounds of objection to the petition. Unless it do so, it shall be
regarded as objecting only that the petition does not state facts sufficient to con
stitute a cause of action. 

§ 91. When any of the defects enumer
ated in section eighty-nine do not appear upon the face of the petition; the ob
jection may be taken by answer; and if no objection betaken, either by demurrer
or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to hare waived the same, except only
the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, and that the petitipn does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 

§ 92. When a demurrer is sus
tained, on the ground of misjoinder of several causes of action, the court, on
motion of the plaintiff, shall allow him, with or without costs, in its discretion,
to file several petitions, each including such of said causes of action as might
have been joined; and an action shall be docketed for each of said petitions,
and the same 6hall be proceeded in without further service. 

§ 93. The defendant may demur to one or
more of the several causes of action stated in the petition, and answer to the
residue. 

§ 94. The answer shall contain: First, A general or
specific denial of each material allegation of the petition controverted by the
defendant. Secon A statement of any new matter constituting a defense,
counterclaim or setotf, or a right to relief concerning the subject of the action,
in ordinary and concise language, and without repetition. Third, When relief
is sought, the nature of the relief to which the defendant supposes himself entitled. The defendant may set forth, in his answer, as many grounds of defense,
counterclaim, setoff, and for relief, as he may have, whether they be such as
have been heretofore denominated legal, or equitable, or both. Each must be
separately stated and numbered, and they must refer, in an intelligible manner,
to the causes of action which they are intended to answer. 

§ 95. The counterclaim mentioned in the last section must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against a plaintiff, be
tween whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and arising out of
the contract or transaction set forth in the petition as the foundation of the
plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject of the action. The right to re
lief concerning the subject of the action, mentioned in the same section, must
be a right to relief necessarily or properly involved in the action for a complete
determination thereof, or settlement of the question involved therein. 

§ 96. If the defendant omit to
set np a counterclaim or setoff, he cannot recover costs against the plaintiff in
any subsequent action thereon; but this section shall not apply to causes of ac
tion which are stricken out of or withdrawn from the answer, as in sections
ninety-seven and one hundred and twenty. 

§ 97. When it appears that a new party
is necessary to a final decision upon a counterclaim, the court may either per
mit the new party to be made by a summons, to reply to the counterclaim, or
may direct the counterclaim to be stricken out of the answer, and made the sub
ject of a separate action. 

§ 98. A setoff can only be pleaded in an ac
tion founded on contract, and must be a cause of action arising upon contract
or ascertained by the decision of a court. 

§ 99. When it appears that a new party is
necessary to a final decision upon the setoff, the court shall permit the new party
to be made, if it also appear that, owing to the insolvency or non-residence of
the plaintiff, or other cause, the defendant will be in danger of losing his claim,
unless permitted to use it as a setoff. 

§ 100. When cross demands have ex
isted between persons under such circumstances that, if one had brought an ac
tion against the other, a counterclaim or setoff could have been set up, neither
can be deprived of the benefit thereof by the assignment or death of the other;
but the two demands must be deemed compensated so far as they equal each
other. 

§ 101. The guardian of an infant or per
son of unsound mind, or attorney for a person in prison, shall deny, in the answer,
all the material allegations of the petition prejudicial to such defendant. 

§ 102. When the answer contains
new matter, the plaintiff may reply to such new matter, denying, generally or
specifically, each allegation controverted by him; and he may allege, in ordinary
and concise language, and without repetition, any new matter not inconsistent
with the petition, constituting a defense to such new matter in the answer; or he
may demur to the same for insufficiency, stating, in his demurrer, the grounds
thereof; and he may demur to one or more of such defenses set up in the answer,
and reply to the residue. 

§ 103. If the reply to any defense set up
by the answer be insufficient, the defendant may demur thereto, stating the
grounds of such demurrer. 

§ 104. Where the an
swer contains new matter constituting a right to relief against a co-defendant
concerning the subject of the action, such co-defendant may demur or reply to-
such matter in the same manner as if he were plaintiff, and subject to the same
rules, as far as applicable. 

§ 105. The answer or demurrer, by
the defendant, shall be filed within twenty days after the day on which the sum
mons is returnable; the reply or demurrer shall be filed within thirty days after
the day on which the summons was made returnable; the demurrer to the reply
shall be filed within forty davs after the day on which the summons was made
returnable. 

§ 106. The court, or any judge thereof
in vacation, may, in his discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, allow
an answer or reply to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited
by this act, or by an order enlarge such time. 

§ 107. Every pleading, in a court of rec
ord, must be subscribed by the party or his attorney. 

§ 108. In all actions, allegations of the
execution of written instruments and indorsements thereon, of the existence of
a corporation or partnership, or of any appointment or authority, or the cor
rectness of any account duly verified by the affidavit of the party, his agent or
attorney, shall be taken as true unless the denial of the same be verified by the
affidavit of the party, his agent or attorney. 

§ 109. The verification mentioned
in the last section shall not be required to the answer of a guardian defending
for an infant or person of unsound mind, or a person imprisoned. 

§ 110. If there be several per
sons united in interest and pleading together, the affidavit may be made by any
one of such parties. When a municipal or other corporation is a party, the ver
ification may be made by an officer thereof, its agent or attorney. 

§ 111. The affidavit shall be sufficient if it
state that the affiant believes the facts stated in the pleading to be true. 

§ 112. In all cases where the
party pleading is a non-resident of the county in which the action is brought,
or if be shall be absent from the county where the pleading is filed, an affidavit,
made before filing the pleading, stating the substance of the facts afterward in
serted in the pleading, shall be a sufficient verification. Such affidavit shall be
filed with the pleading intended to be verified thereby. 

§ 113. The affidavit verifying
pleadings may be made before any person before whom a deposition might be
taken, and must be signed by the party making the same; and the officer before
whom the same was taken, shall certify that it was sworn to or affirmed before
him, and signed in his presence. The certificate of such officer, signed officially
by him, shall be evidence that the affidavit was duly made, that the name of the
officer was written by himself, and that he was such officer

§ 114. When the affi
davit is made by the agent or attorney, it must set forth the reason why it is
not made by the party himself. It can be made by the agent or attorney only:
First, When the facts are within the personal knowledge of the agent or attor
ney. Second, When the plaintiff is an infant, or of unsound mind, or impris
oned. Third, When the pleading to be verified is founded upon a written
instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument is in the pos
session of the agent or attorney. Fourth, When the party is not a resident of,
or is absent from, the county. 

§ 115. In the construction of
any pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall
be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.

§ 116. All fictions in pleadings are abol
ished. 

§ 117. The title of a cause shall not be changed
in any of its stages. 

§ 118. If the action,
counterclaim or setoff be founded on account or on a note, bill, or other written
instrument, as evidence of indebtedness, a copy thereof must be attached to and
filed with the pleading. If not so attached and filed, the reason thereof must
be stated in the pleading. But if the action, counterclaim or setoff be founded
upon a series of written instruments executed by the same person, it shall be
sufficient to attach and file a copy of one only, and in succeeding causes of ac
tion or defenses, to set forth in general terms descriptions of the several instru
ments respectively. 

§ 119. If
redundant or irrelevant matter be inserted in any pleading, it may be stricken
out, on motion of the party prejudiced thereby; and when the allegations of a
pleading are so indefinite and uncertain that the precise nature of the charge or
defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite
and certain by amendment. 

§ 120. The court, \t any time before
the final submission of the cause, on motion of the defendant, may allow a
counterclaim or setoff, set up in the answer, to be withdrawn, and the same may
become the subject of another action; on motion of either party, to be made at
the time such counterclaim or setoff is withdrawn, an action on the same shall
be docketed and proceeded in, as in like cases after process served; and the
court shall direct the time and manner of pleading therein. If an action be
not so docketed, it may afterwards be commenced in the ordinary way. 

§ 121. In pleading a judgment, or
other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall be suffi
cient to state that such judgment or determination was duly given or made; and
•the jurisdiction of any such court or officer shall be presumed until the contrary
appears. 

§ 122. In pleading the per
formance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall be sufficient to state that
the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegations
be controverted, the party pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts show
ing such performance. 

§ 123. In
an action, counterclaim or setoff, founded upon an account, promissory note,
bill of exchange or other instrument, for the unconditional payment of money
only, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a copy of the account or instru
ment, with all credits, and the indorsements thereon, and to state that there is
due to him, on such account or instrument, from the adverse party, a specified
sum, which he claims, with interest. When others than the makers of a prom
issory note, or the acceptors of a bill of exchange, are parties in the action, it
shall be necessary to state, also, the kind of liability of the several parties, and
the facts, as they may be, which fix their liability. 

§ 124. In pleading a pri
vate statute, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such
statute by its title, and the day of its approval, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof. 

§ 125. In an action
for libel or slander, it shall be sufficient to state, generally, that the defamatory
matter was published or spoken of the plaintiff; and if the allegation be denied,
the plaintiff must prove, on the trial, the facts, showing that the defamatory
matter was published or spoken of him. 

§ 126. In the actions mentioned
in the last section, the defendant may allege the truth of the matter charged as
defamatory, and may prove the same, and any mitigating circumstances, to re
duce the amount of damages, or he may prove either. 

§ 127. In any action for the re
covery of real property, it shall be described with such convenient certainty as
will enable an officer holding an execution to identify it. 

§ 128. Every material
allegation of the petition, not controverted by the answer, and every material
allegation of new matter in the answer, not controverted by the reply, shall, for
the purposes of the action, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter
in the reply shall be deemed to be controverted by the adverse party, as upon
■direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require. A demurrer to a reply shall
not be held to admit any of the facts alleged in such reply for any purpose other
than to determine the sufficiency thereof. Allegations of value, or of amount
of damages, shall not be considered as true, by failure to controvert them; but,
this shall not apply to the amount claimed in actions on contract, express or im
plied, for the recovery of money only. 

§ 129. A material allegation, in a plead
ing, is one essential to the claim or defense, which could not be 6tricken from
the pleading without leaving it insufficient 
§ 130. Neither presumptions of law
nor matters of which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in the pleading.

§ 131. When a tender of money is alleged in any plead
ing, it shall not be necessary to deposit the money in court when the pleading is
filed, but it shall be sufficient if the money is deposited in court at the trial, or
when ordered by the court. 

§ 132. If an original pleading be lost, or with
held by any person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be substituted. 

§ 133. No variance between the allegations,
in a pleading, and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it have actually
misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense
upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has been so misled, that
fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and it must also be shown
in what respect he has been misled, and thereupon the court may order the plead
ing to be amended, upon such terms as may be just 

§ 134. When the variance is not ma
terial, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found,
according to the evidence, and may order an immediate amendment without
cost 

§ 135. When, however,
the allegation of the claim or defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved,
not in some particular or particulars only, but in its general scope and meaning,
it is not to be deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a fail
ure of proof. 

§ 136. The plaintiff may amend
his petition without leave, at any time "before the answer is filed, without preju
dice to the proceedings; but notice of such amendment shall be served upon the
defendant or his attorney, and the defendant shall have the same time to answer
or demur thereto as to the original petition. 

§ 137. At any time within ten days
after the demurrer is tiled, the adverse party may amend, of course, on payment
•of costs since tiling the defective pleading. Notice of the filing of an amended
pleading shall be forthwith served upon the other party or his attorney, who
shall have the same time thereafter to answer or reply thereto, as to an original
pleading. 

§ 138. Upon a demurrer being
overruled, the party who demurred may answer or reply, if the court be satis
fied that he has a meritorious claim or defense, and did not demur for delay.
§ 139. The court may, before or
after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading, process or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in
any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or con
form the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved, when such amendment
does not change substantially the claim or defense; and when any proceeding
fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this code, the court may
permit the same to be made conformable thereto by amendment. 

§ 140. The court, in every stage of action,
must disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does
not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be
reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect. 

§ 141. If the demurrer be
sustained, the adverse party may amend, if the defect can be remedied by way
of amendment, with or without costs, as the court, in its discretion, shall direct.

§ 142. When either party shall amend any plead
ing or proceeding, ana the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that
the adverse party could not be ready for trial, in consequence thereof, a contin
uance may be granted to some day in term, or to another term of the court.
§ 143. When the plaintiff shall be igno
rant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated, in any
pleading or proceeding, by any name or description; and when his true name
is discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly. The
plaintiff, in such case, must state in his petition that he could not ascertain the
true name; and the summons must contain the words, "real name unknown,"
and a copy thereof must be served personally upon the defendant. 
§ 144. Either party may be allowed,
on notice, and on such terms, as to costs, as the court may prescribe, to file a
supplemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts material to the case, oc
curring after the former petition, answer or reply. 

§ 145. Whenever two or more actions are pend
ing in the same court, which might have been joined, the defendant may, on
motion and notice to the adverse party, require him to show cause why the
6ame shall not be consolidated, and if no cause be shown, the said several
actions shall be consolidated. 

§ 146. The order for consolidation may be made
by the court, or by a judge thereof, in vacation. 

§ 147. A defendant in a civil action can be arrested,
before and after judgment, in the manner prescribed by this code, and not
otherwise; but this provision does not apply to proceedings for contempt; nor
does it apply to actions or judgments prosecuted in the name of the state of
Kansas to recover fines or penalties for crimes, misdemeanors or offenses. 

§ 148. An order for the arrest of the de
fendant shall be made by the clerk of the court in which the action is brought,
when there is filed in his office an affidavit of the plaintiff, his authorized agent
or attorney, stating the nature of the plaintiff's claim, that it is just, and the
amount thereof, as nearly as may be, and showing one or more of the followin »
particulars:
JFw»t, That the defendant has removed, or begun to remove, any of his
property out of the jurisdiction of the court, with intent to defraud his creditors.
Second, That he has begun to convert his property, or a part thereof, into
money, for the purpose of placing it beyond the reach of his creditors.
Third, That he has property, or rights of action, which he fraudulently con
ceals.
Fourth, That he has assigned, removed or disposed of, or has begun to dis
pose of, his property, or a part thereof, with intent to defraud his creditors.
Fifth, That he fraudulently contracted the debt, or incurred the obligation,
for which suit is about to be or has been brought. The affidavit shall also con
tain a statement of the facts claimed to justify the belief in the existence of
one or more of the above particulars. 

§ 149. The order of arrest shall not be issued by
the clerk, until there has been executed, by one or more sufficient sureties of
the plaintiff, a written undertaking to the effect that the plaintiff shall pay to the
defendant all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, if the
order be wrongfully obtained, not exceeding double the amount of the plaintiff s
claim stated in the affidavit. 

§ 150. The order may be made to accompany
the summons, or at any time afterward, before the judgment. 

§ 151. The order of arrest shall be
addressed and delivered, with a copy of the affidavit, to the sheriff; the order
shall state the name of the parties, the court in which the action is brought, and
the amount of the plaintiffs claim specified in the affidavit, and shall require
the sheriff to arrest the defendant, and hold him to bail in double the sum stated
in the affidavit, and to make return of the order on a day to be named therein,
with the undertaking of the bail, if any be given. 

§ 152. The return day of the order of arrest,
when issued at the commencement of the suit, shall be the same as that of the
summons; when issued afterward, it shall be fifteen days after it is issued. 
§ 153. The sheriff shall execute the order
by arresting the defendant, and delivering to him a copy of the order, and of
the affidavit. If the defendant cannot be found before the return day, the
plaintiff shall be entitled to further orders, without another affidavit or under
taking until the defendant is arrested; but orders of arrest shall not be issued
to any other than the county in which the action is brought. 
§ 154. The defendant, when arrested,
shall be committed by the sheriff to the jail of the county, and kept in custody
until discharged by law. 
§ 155. The defendant may, be
fore or after giving bail, deposit in the hands of the sheriff, or in the court, the
amount of money mentioned in the order of arrest; whereupon he shall be dis
charged, or bis bail, if any be given, shall be released. 
§ 156. The sheriff shall pay into court the money
received by him in lieu of bail. If received in vacation, he shall pay it in on
the first day of the next term; if received during a term, he shall pay it in im
mediately. 

§ 157. The court shall make proper orders for
the safe keeping of money deposited in lieu of bail. It may direct the sheriff
to keep the money, and, after final judgment in the action, shall order it to be
paid to the party entitled thereto, according to the result. 

§ 158. Money so deposited with the
sheriff, in lieu of bail, or directed by the court to be kept by him, shall be held
upon his official responsibility; and he and his sureties shall be liable, and may
be proceeded against for any default in relation thereto, as in other cases of de
linquency. 

§ 159. Bail may be given by the defendant on his arrest,
or at any time afterward, before judgment. It shall be done by causing one or
more sufficient sureties to execute a written undertaking to the plaintiff, in the
presence of the sheriff, to the effect that, if judgment shall be rendered in the
action against the defendant, he will render himself amenable to the process of
the court thereon. The undertaking, when accepted, shall be returned to the
clerk's office, and the defendant discharged. 

§ 160. The plaintiff or his attorney may ac
cept the bail by indorsing such acceptance on the undertaking; or may object to
the bail, for insufficiency, at any time within five days after tlie undertaking has
been given. Within such time, he shall serve upon the sheriff a written notice
that he does not accept the bail, or he shall be deemed to have accepted it, and
the sheriff shall be exonerated from liability. When the undertaking is given
after return of arrest, the plaintiff shall have notice thereof. 
§ 161. On the receipt of such notice, the
sheriff or defendant may, within two days thereafter, give, to the plaintiff or his
attorney, notice, in writing, of the justification of the same or other bail, before
a judge or clerk of the court in which the action is brought, a probate judge or
justice of the peace, at a specified time and place; the time to be not less than
five nor more than ten days thereafter. In case other bail be given, there must
be a new undertaking. 
§ 162. For the purpose of justification, each
of the bail must attend before the proper officer, at the time and place mentioned,
and may be examined on oath or affirmation touching his sufficiency, in such
manner as the officer may think proper. 
§ 163. If the officer find the bail sufficient, he
shall indorse his allowance on the undertaking, and cause the same to be filed
with the clerk, and the sheriff shall thereupon be discharged from liability. 
§ 164. After being arrested, if the defendant
escapes or be rescued, or bail be not taken, or be adjudged insufficient, or a
deposit be not made, the sheriff shall be liable as bail. But he may discharge
himself from liability by putting in sufficient bail at any time before judgment
§ 165. The return of "not
found," upon an execution against the body of the defendant shall be necessary
to fix the liability of the sheriff as bail, which liability shall be the amount of
the judgment, interest and costs. This liability shall be enforced only in a sep
arate action against him, or against him and his sureties on his official bond, as
jn other cases of delinquency. 

§ 166. The bail adjudged insufficient, shall
be liable to the sheriff for the damages he may sustain by reason of such insuf
ficiency. 
§ 167. The liability of the bail shall be fixed in
the manner provided in section one hundred and sixty-five, for fixing the lia
bility of the sheriff as bail, and the bail can be proceeded against in an action
only. 
§ 168. A surrender of the defendant
to the sheriff of the county in which he was arrested, with a delivery of a cer
tified copy of the undertaking of the bail, whether such surrender be made by
the defendant himself, or by his bail, shall discharge the bail. Such surrender
may be made at any time before the return day of the summons in an action
against the bail. The sheriff shall give to the bail a written acknowledgment
of the surrender, and hold the defendant in his custody, upon said copy of the
undertaking of the bail, as upon an order of arrest. On the production of the
sheriff1 s acknowledgment of the surrender, to the clerk of the court, an exonera
tion of the bail shall be entered on his undertaking. 

§ 169. For the purpose of surrendering the
defendant, the bail, at any time and place, before he is finally charged, may
himself arrest him, or by a written authority, indorsed on a certified copy of
the undertaking, may empower any person of suitable age and discretion to do
so. 
§ 170. The bail will be exonerated by the
death of the defendant, or his imprisonment in a state prison, or by his legal
discharge from the obligation to surrender himself amenable to the process of
the court, or by his surrender to the sheriff of the county in which he was ar
rested in execution thereof, within the time fixed in section one hundred and
sixtv-eight, or within such further time as the court, in which the action is pend
ing* may allow. 

§ 171. If money be deposited

the same garnishees after they shall have once been discharged, upon a new
affidavit, if he shall have reason to believe they have subsequently become
liable; and he may proceed against garnishees resident in other counties than
that in which the action is pending; but if an issue for trial shall be joined be
tween the plaintiff and such garnishee, the court may, on motion, change the
place of trial of such issue to the county of the garnishee's residence. 

§ 200<2. Within twenty days from the
service of such garnishee summons the garnishee may, if the truth warrant, file
with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending his affidavit, substan

County, , ss. — E. F., being first duly sworn, says that on the day of ,
A D. 18—, he was served with a garnishee summons in the above-entitled action; that he was then
and is now in no manner and upon no account indebted or under liability to the defendant (naming
him), and that he then had and now has in his possession or under his control no real estate and no
personal property, effects, or credits, of any description, belonging to said defendant or in which he
has any interest; and is in no manner liable as garnishee in this action. Subscribed and sworn to
before me, this day of , A. D. 18—.
Thereby the proceedings against such garnishee shall be deemed discon

within twenty days thereafter the plaintiff serve notice on such garnishee that
he elects to take issue on his answer as garnishee, and will maintain him to be
liable as garnishee; in which case the issue shall stand for trial as a civil action,
in which the affidavit on the part of the plaintiff shall be deemed the petition
and the garnishee's affidavit the answer thereto. 

§ 200<j. Unless the garnishee shall make
the affidavit provided for in section five he shall, within twenty days from the
service of the garnishee summons, file an affidavit in which he shall state —
First, Whether he was at the time of the service of the garnishee summons

whether an absolute or contingent liability, and all the facts and circumstances
necessary to a complete understanding of such indebtedness or liability. When
the garnishee shall be in doubt respecting any such liability or indebtedness he
may set forth all the facts and circumstances concerning the same, and submit
the question to the court.
Second, Whether he held at the time aforesaid or now holds the title or pos
session of any real estate, or any interest in land of any description, or of any

any such belonging to the defendants, or in which he is in any wise interested;
and if he 111011 admit any such, or be in doubt respecting the same, he shall set
forth a description of such property, and all the facts and circumstances con
cerning the same, and the title, interest, or claim of the defendant in or to the
same.

erty to which the defendant, and any other person as well, makes claim, he may
set forth the names and residences of such other claimants, and so far as known,

summoned, shall fail to file his affidavit as required in the preceding sections,
the court may render judgment against him for the amount of the judgment

and costs, together with the costs of such garnishee. Such garnishee may also
be proceeded against as for contempt. 
§ 200<7- The answer of the garnishee
shall in all cases be conclusive of the truth of the facts therein stated, unless
the plaintiff shall within twenty days serve upon the garnishee a notice in writ
ing that he elects to take issue on his answer; in which case the issue shall
stand for trial as a civil action, in which the affidavit on the part of the plaintiff
shall be deemed the petition, and the garnishee's affidavit the answer thereto.
The plaintiff may in all cases move the court, upon the answer of the garnishee,
and of the defendant, if he shall also answer, for such judgment as he shall be
entitled to thereon, but any such judgment shall be no bar beyond the facts
stated in such answer. 
§ 200A. The answer of a corporation
summoned as a garnishee may be made by any officer thereof; and of any other
garnishee, by any agent or attorney, in his behalf, who shall be acquainted with
the facts.

verified, to be served within twenty days from the service of the garnishee sum
mons on him, defend the proceedings against any garnishee, upon the ground

from execution against such defendant, or for any other reason is not liable to
garnishment; or upon any ground upon which a garnishee might defend the
same; and may participate in the trial of any issue between the plaintiff and
garnishee for the protection of his interests. And the garnishee may, at his
option, defend the principal action for the defendant, if the latter does not, but
shall be under no obligations so to do. 
§ 200;'. The proceedings
against a garnishee shall be deemed an action by the plaintiff against the gar

judgments shall be applicable thereto; but when the garnish inont is not in aid
of an execution, no trial shall be had of the garnishee action until the plaintiff
shall have judgment in the principal action, and if the defendant have judg
ment, the garnishee action shall be dismissed with costs. The court shall ren
der such judgment in all cases as shall be just to all the parties, and properly
protect their respective interests, and may adjudge the recovery of any indebt
edness, the conveyance, transfer, or delivery to the sheriff, or any officer ap

principal officer thereof may be so examined. Such deposition may be taken
before the probate judge, or before a notary public to be designated by the
judge of the court in which the action is pending, on application by the plaint
iff upon five days' previous notice to the defendant, stating the time and place
of such application, or it may be taken without the state upon commission, in
the manner provided for taking other depositions. The attendance of the gar
nishee to be examined may be compelled upon subpoena and the payment of wit
ness fees if demanded; and such examination shall be subject to the same rules
as that of any other witness, but he shall not be compelled to disclose anything

in his hands, and the name and residence of such claimant, the court may, on
motion, order that such claimant be interpleaded, as a defendant to the gar
nishee action; and that notice thereof, setting forth the facts, with a copy of such
order, in such form as the court shall direct, be served upon him; and that after
such service shall have been made, the garnishee may pay or deliver to the offi
cer or the clerk such indebtedness or property, and have a receipt therefor,

manner required for service of a summons in a civil action, and may be made
without the state, or by publication thereof, if the order shall so direct. Upon
such service being made, such claimant shall be deemed a defendant to the gar
nishee action, and within twenty days shall answer, setting forth his claim or any
defense which the garnishee might have made. In case of default, judgment

the defendant, except such as may be by law exempt from execution. Any
property, moneys, credits and effects held by a conveyance or title, void as to
the creditors of the defendant, shall be embraced in such liability. In case such
moneys, credits and effects in the possession or under the control of the gar
nishee shall exceed the amount of the plaintiff's claim, the garnishee shall stand
liable to the plaintiff only for the amount of the plaintiff's claim as disclosed by
the affidavit provided for in section two thousand seven hundred and fifty-three,
together with such farther amount as shall be equal to all costs and damages
which the plaintiff may recover in the action and garnishee proceedings.

dered upon a liability of the garnishee arising either —First, By reason of his
having drawn, accepted, made, indorsed or guaranteed any negotiable bill, draft,

emergency. Judgment may be given for any money or other thing owing
although it has not become payable, in which case the garnishee shall not be re
quired to pay or deliver it before the time appointed by the contract. 

§ 200o. No action shall be commenced by the defend
ant or his assignee against a garnishee upon any claim or demand liable to
garnishment, or to recover any property garnished, or execution be issued upon

prosecution of one stayed.

the effect that they will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the amount of the
judgment, with all costs that may be recovered against such defendant in the
action, not exceeding a sum specified, which sum shall not be less than double
the amount demanded by the complaint on file, or in such less sum as the court
shall, upon application, direct. The sureties shall justify their responsibility by
affidavit annexed stating a sum which each is worth, in property within this state,
over and above all his debts and liabilities and property exempt from execntion,

garnishee admitted by his answer; and if he do not, the garnishee shall recover
costs of the plaintiff. The costs shall include an attorney's fee of twenty-five
dollars, to be taxed in favor of the prevailing party. In all other cases under

money received by him from garnishees, shall be held and paid over by him,
nnder the same requirement and responsibility of himself and sureties, as are
provided in respect to money deposited in lieu of bail. 

§ 213. If the defendant, or
other person on his behalf, at any time before judgment, cause an undertaking to
be executed to the plaintiff, by one or more sureties, resident in the county, to be

in his affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of
the court, the attachment in such action shall be discharged, and restitution

erty of the defendant in his hands. 

§ 214. The undertaking men

in the hands of the officer, after applying the moneys arising from the sale of
perishable property, and so much of the personal property and lands and tene

satisfy the judgment, shall be sold by order of the court, under the same restric
tions and regulations as if the same had been levied on by execution; and the
money arising therefrom, with the amount which may be recovered from the
garnishee, shall be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs. If there be not

thereon for the residue, in all respects as in other cases. Any surplus of the
attached property or its proceeds shall be returned to the defendant 

§ 223. The court may com

contempt. 

§ 224. The court may order the sheriff
to repossess himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached prop

to take the property as he would have under an order of attachment. 
§ 225. Where several attachments are

ties to the action. 
§ 227. The defendant may, at any time
before judgment, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move the court for ad
ditional security on the part of the plaintiff; and if, on such motion, the court
is satisfied that the surety in the plaintiff's undertaking has removed from this

attachment and direct restitution of any property taken under it, unless, in a
reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, sufficient security be given by the
plaintiff.

lent intent, or is about to remove his property, or a material part thereof, with
the intent or to the effect of cheating or defrauding his creditors, or of hinder
ing or delaying them in the collection of their debts, a creditor may b/ing an
action on his claim before it is due, and have an attachment against the property

§ 231. The attachment authorized by the
last section may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by
the judge thereof, or, in his absence from the county, by the probate judge of
the county in which the action is brought; but before such action shall be
brought, or such attachment shall be granted, the plaintiff, or his agent or
attorney, shall make an oath in writing, showing the nature and amount of the
plaintiff's claim, that it is just, when the same will become due, and the exist
ence of some one of the grounds for an attachment enumerated in the preced
ing section. 
§232. If the court
or judge refuse to grant an order of attachment, the action shall be dismissed,
but without prejudice to a future action; and in all such actions, application for
an attachment must be made.

or judge granting the attachment shall specify the amount for which it is allowed,
not exceeding a sum sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim, and the probable
costs of the action. 
§ 234. The order of attachment, as
granted by the court or judge, shall not be issued by the clerk until there has
been executed, in his office, an undertaking, on the part of the plaintiff, as in

ment in an action, or may be allowed as a provisional remedy, and, when so
allowed, it shall be by order. The writ of injunction is abolished. 
§ 238. When it appears, by the petition,
that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part
thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act, the
commission or continuance of which, during the litigation, would produce injury
to the plaintiff; or when, during the litigation, it appears that the defendant is
doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done,
some act in violation of the plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of the action,
and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be
granted to restrain such act. And when, during the pendency of an action, it
shall appear, by affidavit, that the defendant threatens or is about to remove or
dispose of his property with intent to defraud his creditors, or to render the judg
ment ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be granted to restrain such removal
or disposition. It may, also, be granted in any case where it is specially author
ized by statute. 

§ 239. The in
junction may be granted at the time of commencing the action, or any time
afterwards, before judgment, by the district court, or the judge thereof, or, in his
absence from the county, by the probate judge, upon its appearing satisfactorily
to the court or judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff or his agent, that the plaint
iff is entitled thereto. 

§ 240. If the court or judge deem it
proper that the defendant, or any party to the suit, should be heard before grant
ing the injunction, it may direct a reasonable notice to be given to such party to
attend for such purpose, at a specified time and place, and may, in the meantime,
restrain such party. 

§ 241. An injunction shall not be granted
against a party who has answered, unless upon notice; but such party may be
restrained until the decision of the application for an injunction. 

§ 242. No injunction, unless otherwise
provided by special statute, shall operate, until the party obtaining the same
shall give an undertaking, executed by one or more sufficient securities, to be
approved by the clerk of the court granting such injunction, in an amount to
be fixed by the court or judge allowing the same, to secure to the party injured
the damages he may sustain, if it be finally decided that the injunction ought
not to have been granted. 

§ 243. The order of in
junction shall be addressed to the party enjoined, shall state the injunction,
and shall be issued by the clerk. Where the injunction is allowed at the com
mencement of the action, the clerk shall indorse upon the summons "Injunc
tion allowed," and it shall not be necessary to issue the order of injunction, nor
shall it be necessary to issue the same where notice of the application therefor
has been given to the party enjoined. The service of the summons so indorsed,
or the notice of an application for an injunction, shall be notice of its allowance.

§ 244. Where the injunction is allowed
during ihe litigation, and without notice of the application therefor, the order of
injunction shall be issued, and the sheriff, shall forthwith serve the same upon
each party enjoined, in the manner prescribed for serving a summons, and make
return thereof without delay. 
§ 245. An injunction binds the party from
the time he has notice thereof, and the undertaking required by the applicant
therefor is executed. [
§ 246. No injunction shall be granted by
a judge, after a motion therefor has been overruled on the merits of the appli
cation, by his court; and where it has been refused by the court in which the
action is brought, or a judge thereof, it shall not be granted to the same appli
cant, bv a court of inferior jurisdiction, or any judge thereof. 
§ 247. An injunction granted
by a judge, may be enforced as the act of the court. Disobedience of any in
junction may be punished as a contempt, by the court or any judge who might
have granted it in vacation. An attachment may be issued by the court or
judge, upon being satisfied, by affidavit, of the breach of the injunction, against
the party guilty of the same, and he may be required, in the discretion of the
court or judge, to pay a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars, for the use of
the county, to make immediate restitution to the party injured, and give further
security to obey the injunction; or, in default thereof, he may be committed to
close custody, until he shall fully comply with such requirements, or be other
wise legally discharged. 

§ 248. A party enjoined may, at any
time before judgment, upon reasonable notice to the party who has obtained
the injunction, move the court for additional security; and if it appear that the
•urety in the undertaking has removed from the state, or is insufficient, the court
may vacate the injunction, unless, in a reasonable time, sufficient security is
given. 

§ 249. On the hearing of an application
for an injunction, each party may read affidavits. All affidavits shall be filed.
§ 250. If the injunction be
granted without notice, the defendant, at any time before the trial, may apply,
upon notice, to the court in which the action is brought, or any judge thereof,
to vacate or modify the same. The application may be made upon the petition
and affidavits upon winch the injunction is granted, or upon affidavits on the part of the party enjoined, with or without answer. The order of the judge,
allowing, dissolving or modifying an injunction, shall be returned to the office
of the clerk of the court in which the action is brought, and recorded and
obeyed, as if made by the court. 

§ 251. If application be made upon affi
davits, on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose
the same, by affidavits or other evidence, in addition to that on which the in
junction was granted. 

§ 252. A defendant may
obtain an injunction upon an answer, in the nature of a counterclaim. He shall
proceed in the manner hereinbefore prescribed. 

§ 253. An injunction may be granted
to enjoin the illegal levy of any tax, charge or assessment, or the collection of any
illegal tax, charge or assessment, or any proceeding to enforce the same; and any
number of persons whose property is affected by a tax or assessment so levied,
may unite in the petition filed to obtain such injunction. An injunction may
be granted in the name of the state to enjoin and suppress the keeping and
maintaining of a common nuisance. The petition therefor shall be verified by
the county attorney of the proper county, or by the attorney general, upon in
formation and belief, and no bond shall be required. 

§ 254. A receiver may be appointed
by the supreme court, the district court, or any judge of either, or in the ab
sence of said judges from the county, by the probate judge: First, In an action

subject any property or fund to his claim, or between partners or others jointly
owning or interested in any property or fund, on the application of the plaint

proceeds thereof, is probable, and where it is shown that the property or fund
is in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured. Second, In an action
by a mortgagee for the foreclosure of his mortgage and sale of the mortgaged
property, where it appears that the mortgaged property is in danger of being
lost, removed or materially injured, or that the condition of the mortgage has
not been performed, and that the property is probably insufficient to discharge
the mortgage debt. Third, After judgment, to carry the judgment into effect
Fourth, After judgment, to dispose of the property according to the judgment,
or to preserve it during the pendency of an appeal, or in proceedings in aid of
execution, when an execution has been returned unsatisfied, or when the judg

Fifth, In the cases provided in this code, and by special statutes, when a cor
poration has been dissolved, or is insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolv
ency, or has forfeited its corporate rights. Sixth, In all other cases where
receivers have heretofore been appointed by the usages of the courts of equity.

§ 255. No party, or attorney, or person
interested in an action, shall be appointed receiver therein. 

§ 256. Before entering upon his duties, the re
ceiver must be sworn to perform them faithfully, and with one or more sureties,
approved by the court or judge, execute an undertaking to such person, and in
such sum as the court or judge shall direct, to the effect that he will faithfully
discharge the duties of receiver in the action, and obey the orders of the court
therein. 
§ 257. The receiver has, under the control
of the court, power to bring and defend actions in his own name, as receiver; to
take and keep possession of the property, to receive rents, collect debts, to com
pound for and compromise the same, to make transfers, and generally to do such
acts respecting the property as the court may authorize. 

§ 258. Funds in the hands of a receiver may be invested
upon interest, by order of the court; but no such order shall be made, except
upon the consent of all the parties to the action. 
§ 259. When it is admitted, by the
pleading or examination of a party, that he has in his possession or under his
control any money or other thing capable of delivery, which, being the subject
of litigation, is held by him as trustee for another party, or which belongs or is
due to another party, the court may order the same to be deposited in court or
delivered to such party, with or without security, subject to the further direction
of the court. 

§ 260. Whenever, in the exercise of
its authority, a court shall have ordered the deposit or delivery of money or other
thing, and the order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the disobedience
as for a contempt, may make an order requiring the sheriff to take the money,
or thing:, and deposit or deliver it, in conformity with the direction of the court.
§ 261. Issues arise on the pleadings, where a fact or
conclusion of law is maintained by one party, and contfoverted by the other.
They are two kinds: First, Of law. Second, Of fact 

§ 262. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer
to the petition, answer or reply, or to some part thereof. 

§ 263. An issue of facts arises: First, Upon a
material allegation in the petition, controverted by the answer; or, second,
upon new matter in the answer, controverted by the reply; or, third, upon
new matter in the reply, which shall be considered as controverted by the de
fendant without further pleading. 
§ 264. Issues, both of law and fact, may
arise upon different parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases
the issues of law must be first tried, unless the court otherwise direct 
§ 265. A trial is a judicial examination of the issues,
whether of law or fact, in an action. 
§ 266. Issues of law must be tried by the
court, unless referred. Issues of fact arising in actions for the recovery of
money, or of specific real or personal property, shall be tried by a jury, unless
a jury trial is waived, or a reference be ordered, as hereinafter provided. 

§ 267. All other issues of fact shall be tried
by the court, subject to its power to order any issue or issues to be tried by a
jury, or referred as provided in this code. 

§ 268. A separate trial between the plaintiff
and any or all of several defendants, may be allowed by the court, whenever
justice will be thereby promoted. 

§ 269. The general mode of summoning
the jury is such as is or may be provided by law. 
§ 270. If there shall be impan
eled, for the trial of any cause, any petit juror, who shall have been convicted
of any crime which by law renders him disqualified to serve on a jurv; or who
lias been arbitrator on either side, relating to the same controversy; or who has
an interest in the cause; or who has an action pending between him and either
party; or who has formerly been a juror in the same cause; or who is the em
ployer, employe, counselor, agent, steward or attorney of either party; or who
is subpoenaed as a witness; or who is of kin to either party; or any person who
shall have served once already on a jury, as a talesman on the trial of any cause,
in the same court during the term, he may be challenged for such causes; in
either of which cases the same shall be considered as a principal challenge, and
the validity thereof be tried by the court; and any petit juror who shall be re
turned upon the trial of any of the causes hereinbefore specified, against whom
no principal cause of challenge can be alleged, may, nevertheless, be challenged
on suspicion of prejudice against, or partiality for, either party, or for want of
competent knowledge of the English language, or any other cause that may
render him, at the time, an unsuitable juror; and the validity of such challenge
shall be determined by the court. 

§ 271. The plaintiff first, and afterward
the defendant, shall complete his challenges for cause. They may then, in
torn, in the same order, have the right to challenge one juror each, until each
shall have peremptorily challenged three jurors, but no more. 
§ 272. After each challenge, the vacancy
•hall be filled before further challenges are made; and any new juror thus in
troduced may be challenged for cause as well as peremptorily. [
§ 273. When the requisite number of jurors cannot
otherwise be obtained, the sheriff shall select talesmen to supply the deficiency
from the bystanders, or the body of the county, as the court may direct. 
§ 274. The jury shall be sworn to well and truly
try the matters submitted to them in the case in hearing, and a true verdict
give, according to the law and the evidence. 

§ 275. When the jury has been
sworn, the trial shall proceed in the following order unless the court for special
reasons otherwise directs:
First, The party on whom rests the burden of the issues may briefly state
his case, and the evidence by which he expects to sustain it.
Second, The adverse party may then briefly state his defense, and the evi
dence he expects to offer in support of it.
Third, The party on whom rests the burden of the issues must first produce
his evidence; after he has closed his evidence the adverse party may interpose
and file a demurrer thereto, upon the ground that no cause of action or defense
is proved. If the court shall sustain the demurrer, such judgment shall be
rendered for the party demurring as the state of the pleadings or the proof
shall demand. If the demurrer be overruled, the adverse party will then pro
duce his evidence.
Fourth, The parties will then be confined to rebutting evidence unless the
court for good reasons in furtherance of justice permits them to offer evidence
in their original case.
Fifth, When the evidence is concluded and either party desires special in
structions to be given to the jury, such instructions shall be reduced to writing,
numbered, and signed by the party or his aUorney asking the same, and deliv
ered to the court. The court shall give general instructions to the jury, which
shall be in writing, and be numbered, and signed by the judge, if required by
either party.
Sixth, When either party asks special instructions to be given to the jury,
the court shall either give such instructions as requested, or positively re
fuse to do so; or give the instructions with a modification in such manner that
it shall distinctly appear what instructions were given in whole or part, and in
like manner those refused, so that either party may except to the instructions as
asked for, or as modified, or to the modification, or to the refusal. All instruc
tions given by the court must be signed by the judge, and filed together with
those asked for by the parties as a part of the record.
Seventh, After the instructions have been given to the jury, the cause may
be argued. 

§ 276. A party excepting to the
giving of instructions, or the refusal thereof, shall not be required to file a
formal bill of exceptions; but it shall be sufficient to write at the close of each
instruction, ' ' Refused and excepted to, " or, " Given and excepted to, ' ' which
shall be signed by the judge. 

§ 277. Whenever, in the opinion of the court,
it is proper for the jury to have a view of the property which is the subject of
litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order them
to be conducted, in a body, under the charge of an officer, to the place, which
6hall be shown to them by some person appointed by the court for that pur
pose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than the person so ap
pointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with the trial. 
§ 278. When the case is finally submitted
to the jury, they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If they retire,
they must be kept together, in some convenient place, under charge of an officer,
until they agree upon a verdict or be discharged by the court, subject to the
discretion of the court to permit them to separate temporarily at night, and at
their meals. The officer having them under his charge shall not suffer any
communication to be made to them, or make any himself, except to ask them if
they are agreed upon their verdict, unless by order of the court; and he shall
not, before their verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of
their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon. 

§ 279. If the jury are permitted to separate, either
during the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admonished
by the court that it is their duty not to converse with, or suffer themselves to be
addressed by, any other person, on any subject of the trial, and that it is their
datv not to form or express an opinion thereon, until the case is finally sub
mitted to them. 
§ 280. After the jury have retired for delib
eration, if there be a disagreement between them as to any part of the testi
mony, or if they desire to be informed as to any part of the law arising in the
case, they may request the officer to conduct them to the court, where the in
formation on the point of law shall be given in writing, and the court may give
its recollections as to the testimony on the point in dispute, in the presence of, or
after notice to, the parties or their counsel. 

§ 281. The jury may be discharged by the court on
account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or calamity requiring their
discharge, or by consent of both parties, or after they have been kept together
until it satisfactorily appears that there is no probability of their agreeing. 
§ 282. In all cases where the jury
are discharged during the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, it may
be tried again immediately, or at a future time, as the court may direct. 
§ 283. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict,
they must be conducted into court, their names called by the clerk, and their
verdict rendered by their foreman. When the verdict is announced, either party
may require the jury to be polled, which is done by the clerk or the court ask
ing each juror if it is his verdict. If any one answers in the negative, the jury
must again be sent out, for further deliberation. 

§ 284. The verdict shall be written, signed by the
foreman and read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry made whether it is
their verdict. If any juror disagrees, the jury must be sent out again; but if
no disagreement be expressed, and neither party requires the jury to be polled,
the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged from the case. If, however,
the verdict be defective in form only, the same may, with the assent of the jury,
before they are discharged, be corrected by the court. 

§ 285. The verdict of a jury is either
general or special. A general verdict is that by which they pronounce gener
ally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.
A special verdict is that by which the jury finds facts only. It must present
the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them;
and they must be so presented as that nothing remains to the court but to draw
from them conclusions of law. 

§ 286. In all cases the jury
6hall render a general verdict, and the court shall in any case at the request of
the parties thereto, or either of them, in addition to the general verdict, direct
the jury to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in writing by the
party or parties requesting the same. 

§ 287. When the special find
ing of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict, the former controls the lat
ter, and the court may give judgment accordingly. 

§ 288. When, by the verdict, either
party is entitled to recover money of the adverse party, the jury, in their ver
dict, must assess the amount of recovery. 

§ 289. The trial by jury may be waived by
the parties, in actions arising on contract, and with the assent of the court in
other actions, in the following manner: By the consent of the party appearing,
when the other party fails to appear at the trial by himself or attorney. By
written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the clerk. By oral con
sent, in open court, entered on the journal. 
§ 290. Upon the trial of questions of fact
by the court, it shall not be necessary for the court to state its findings, except
generally, for the plaintiff or defendant, unless one of the parties request it,
with the view of excepting to the decision of the court upon the questions of law
involved in the trial; in which case the court shall state, in writing, the con
clusions of fact found, separately from the conclusions of law. 

§ 291. All or any of the issues in the ac
tion, whether of fact or of law, or both, may be referred, upon the written con
sent of the parties, or upon their oral consent in court, entered upon the journal.
§ 292. When the parties do not consent, the
court may, upon the application of either, or of its own motion, direct a refer
ence in either of the following cases: Where the trial of an issue of fact shall
require the examination of mutual accounts, or when the account is on one side
only, and it shall be made to appear to the court that it is necessary that the
party on the other side should be examined as a witness to prove the account;
in which case the referees may be directed to hear and report upon the whole
issue, or upon any specific question of fact involved therein; or where the tak
ing of an account shall be necessary for the information of the court before
judgment, in cases which may be determined by the court, or for carrying a
judgment into effect; or where a question of fact other than upon the pleadings,
shall arise, upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of an action. 

§ 293. A trial before referees is con
ducted in the same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same power
to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, to administer all necessary
oaths in the trial of the case, and to grant adjournments, as the court, upon
inch trial. They must state the facts found and the conclusions of law separ
ately, and their decisions must be given, and may be excepted to and reviewed
in like manner. The report of the referees upon the whole issue stands as the
decision of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner
as if the action had been tried by the court. When the referee is to report the
facts, the report has the effect of a special verdict. 

§ 294. In all cases of reference, the
parties, except when an infant may be a party, may agree upon a suitable per
son or persons, not exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered accord
ingly, and if the parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or more
referees, not exceeding three, who shall be free from exception. 
§ 295. It shall be the duty of the ref
erees to sign any true exceptions taken to any order or decision by them made
in the case, and return the same, with their report, to the court making the refer
ence. 

§ 296. A judge, in vacation, upon the
written consent of the parties, may make an order of reference which the court
of which he is a member could make in term time. In such case, the order of
reference shall be made on the written agreement of the parties to refer, and
shall be filed with the clerk of the court, with the other papers in the case.
§ 297. The referees must be 6worn or affirmed
well and faithfully to hear and examine the cause, and to make a just and true
report therein, according to the best of their understanding. The oath may be
administered by any person authorized to take depositions. 
§ 298. The referees shall be allowed such com
pensation for their services as the court may deem just and proper, which shall
be taxed as part of the costs in the case. 
§ 299. An exception is an objection taken
to a decision of the court or judge upon a matter of law. 

§ 300. The party objecting to the decision must
except at the time the decision is made, and time may be given to reduce the
exception to writing, but not beyond the term. If the decision objected to is
made in vacation or at chambers, the judge may give time to reduce the excep
tion to writing, not exceeding ten days. 
§ 301. No particular form of exception is
required. The exception must be stated, with so much of the evidence as is
necessary to explain it, and no more, and the whole as briefly as possible. 

§ 302. Where the decision objected to
is entered on the record, and the grounds of objection appear in the entry, the
exception may be taken by the party causing to be noted, at the end of the
decision, that he excepts. 

§ 303. Where the decision is not en
tered on the record, or the grounds of objection do not sufficiently appear in the
entry, the party excepting must reduce his exceptions to writing, and present it
to the judge for his allowance. If true, it shall be the duty of the judge to allow
and sign it; whereupon it shall be filed with the pleadings as a part of the rec
ord, but not spread at large on the journal. If the writing is not true, the judge
shall correct it, or suggest the correction to be made, and it shall then be signed
as aforesaid. 

§ 304. No exception shall be regarded,
unless it is material and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the party ex
iting. 
§ 305. Exceptions taken to the de■cision
of any court of record may, by leave of such court, be withdrawn from
the files by the party taking the same, at any time before proceedings in error
are commenced. 
§ 306. A new trial is a re-examination,
in the same court, of an issue of fact, after a verdict by a jury, report of a ref
eree, or a decision by the court. The former verdict, report or decision shall
be vacated, and a new trial granted, on the application of the party aggrieved,
for any of the following causes, affecting materially the substantial rights of
such party:
First, Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, referee, or prevail
ing party, or any order of the court or referee, 'or abuse of discretion, by which
the party was prevented from having a fair trial.
Second, Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party. •
Third, Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded
against.
Fourth, Excessive damages, appearing to have been given under the influ
ence of passion or prejudice.
Fifth, Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery, whether too large
or too small, where the action is upon a contract, or for the injury or detention
of property.
Sixth, That the verdict, report or decision is not sustained by sufficient evi
dence, or is contrary to law.
Seventh, Newly-discovered evidence, material for the party applying, which
he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
the trial.
Eighth, Error of law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the party
making the application. 

§ 307. A new trial shall
not be granted on account of the smallness of the damages, in an action for an
injury to the person or reputation, nor in any other action where the damages
shall equal the actual pecuniary injury sustained. 
§ 308. The application for' a new trial
must be made at the term the verdict, report or decision is rendered; and, ex
cept for the cause of newly-discovered evidence, material for the party apply
ing, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced
at the trial, shall be within three days after the verdict or decision was rendered
unless unvoidably prevented. 

§ 309. The application must be by
motion, upon written grounds, filed at the time of making the motion. The
causes enumerated in subdivisions two, three and seven, of section three hun
dred and six, must be sustained by affidavits, showing their truth, and may be
controverted by affidavits. 
§ 310. Where the grounds for a new
trial could not, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered before, but are
discovered after the term at which the verdict, report of referee or decision was
rendered or made, the application may be made by petition, filed as in other
cases, not later than the second term after discovery; on which a summons shall
issue, be returnable and served, or publication made, as prescribed in section
seventy-four. The facts stated in the petition shall be considered as denied
without answer, and if the service shall be complete in vacation, the case shall
be heard and summarily decided at the ensuing term, and if in term, it shall be
heard and decided after the expiration of twenty days from such service. The
case shall be placed on the trial docket, and the witnesses shall be examined in
open court, or their depositions taken as in other cases; but no such petition
shall be filed more than one year after the final judgment was rendered. 

§ 311. Whenever damages are recover
able, the plaintiff may claim and recover any rate of damages to which he may
be entitled for the cause of action established. 

§ 312. The provisions of this article
respecting trials by jury apply, so far as they are in their nature applicable, to

clerk of court, at least twelve days before the first day of each term of the court,
and the actions shall be set for particular days in the order hereinafter stated,
and so arranged that the cases set for each day shall be tried as nearly as may
bo on that day, namely: First, Issues of fact to be tried by a jury; second,
issues of fact to be tried by the court; third, issues of law. If the defend
ant fails to answer or demur, the cause, for the purpose of this section, shall be
deemed to be at issue upon questions of fact; but in every such case the plaint
iff may move for and take such judgment as he ifl entitled to on the defend
ant' s default on or after the day on which said action shall be set for trial. No
witnesses shall be subpoenaed in any case while the cause stands upon issue of
law; and whenever the court shall regard the demurrer in any case as frivolous,
and put in for delay only, no leave to answer or reply shall be given, unless
upon payment of all costs then accrued in the action. 

§ 314. The trial of an issue of fact, and the as
sessment of damages in any case, shall be in the order in which they are placed
on the trial docket, unless by the consent of the parties or the order of the court
they are continued or placed at the heel of the docket, unless the court, in its
discretion, shall otherwise direct. The court may, in its discretion, hear at any
time a motion, and may by rule prescribe the time for hearing motions. 

§ 315. Actions shall be triable at the first term of
the court after the issues therein by the times fixed for pleading are, or shall
have been made up ten days before the term. When issues of law are made
up either before or during a term of court, but after the period for preparing
the trial docket of such term, the clerk shall place such actions on the trial
docket of that term; and when any demurrer shall be adjudged to be frivolous,
the cause shall stand for hearing or trial in like manner as if an issue of fact had
been joined in the first instance; but the court may in its discretion fix specially
the time when such cause shall stand for trial. 

§ 316. The court may, for good cause shown,
continue an action at any stage of the proceedings, upon such terms as may be
just When a continuance is granted on account of the absence of evidence, it
shall be at the cost of the party making the application, unless the court other

on account of the absence of evidence, can be made only upon affidavit, show

for an absent witness, the affidavit must show where the witness resides, if his
residence is known to the party, and the probability of procuring his testimony
within a reasonable time, and what facts he believes the witness will prove, and
that he believes them to be true. If, thereupon, the adverse party will consent
that on the trial the facts alleged in the affidavit shall be read and treated as
the deposition of the absent witness, or that the facts in relation to other evi
dence shall be taken as proved to the extent alleged in the affidavit, no contin
uance shall be granted on the ground of the absence of such evidence. 
§ 318. The clerk shall make ont a copy of the

credibility.

§ 321. Any party to a civil action or
proceeding may compel any adverse party or person, for whose benefit such
action or proceeding is instituted, prosecuted or defended, at the trial, or by
deposition, to testify as a witness in the same manner, and subject to the same
rules, as other witnesses.

joint contractor in the absence of his surviving partner or joint contractor,
when such surviving partner or joint contractor is an adverse party. If the testi
mony cf a party to the action or proceeding has been taken, and he afterwards
die, and the testimony so taken shall be used after his death, in behalf of his
executors, administrators, heirs at law, next of kin, assignee, surviving partner

be liable shall be incumbered by mortgage or any other lien or liens, such lands
and tenements may be levied upon and appraised and sold, subject to such lien
or liens, which shall be stated in the appraisement. 

§ 449. If the officer, by
virtue of an execution issued from any court of record in this state, shall levy
the same on any goods and chattels claimed by any person other than the de
fendant, or be requested by the plaintiff to levy on any such goods and chattels,
the officer may require the plaintiff to give him an undertaking, with good and
sufficient securities, to pay all costs and damages that he may sustain by reason
of the detention or sale of such property; and until such undertaking shall be
given, the officer may refuse to proceed as against such property. 

§ 450. In all
cases where a sheriff, coroner or other officer shall, by virtue of an execution,
levy upon any goods and chattels which shall remain upon his hands unsold, for
want of bidders, for the want of time to advertise and sell, or any other reason
able cause, the officer may, for his own security, take of the defendant an un
dertaking, with security, in such sum as he may deem sufficient, to the effect
tliat the said property shall be delivered to the officer holding an execution
for the sale of the same, at the time and place appointed by said officer, either
by notice, given in writing, to said defendant in execution, or by advertisement,
published in a newspaper printed in the county, naming therein the day and
place of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver the goods and chattels at
the time and place mentioned in the notice to him given, or to pay to the officer
holding the execution the full value of said goods and chattels, or the amount
of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given as aforesaid, may be proceeded
on as in other cases. 

§ 451. The officer who levies upon goods and
chattels, by virtue of an execution issued by a court of record, before he pro
ceeds to sell the same shall cause public notice to be given of the time and place
of sale, for at least ten days before the day of sale. The notice shall be given
by advertisement, published in some newspaper printed in the county, or, in
case no newspaper be printed therein, by setting up advertisements in five pub
lic places in the county. Two advertisements shall be put up in the township
where the sale is to be held; and where goods and chattels levied upon cannot
be sold for want of bidders, the officer making such return shall annex to the
execution a true and perfect inventory of such goods and chattels, and the plaint
iff in such execution may thereupon sue out another writ of execution, directing
the sale of the property levied upon as aforesaid; but such goods and chattels
shall not be sold, unless the time and place of sale be advertised, as hereinbefore
provided. 

§ 452. When any writ shall issue, directing the
sale of property previously taken in execution, the officer issuing said writ shall,
at the request of the person entitled to the benefit thereof, his agent or attorney,
add thereto a command to the officer to whom such writ shall be directed, that
if the property remaining in his hands not sold shall, in his opinion, be insuffi
cient to satisfy the judgment, he shall levy the same upon lands and tenements,
goods and chattels, or either, as the law shall permit, being the property of the
judgment debtor, sufficient to satisfy the debt. 

§ 453. If execution be levied upon lands and
tenements, the officer levying such execution shall call an inquest of three dis
interested householders, who shall be resident within the county where the lands
taken in execution are situate, and administer to them an oath, impartially to ap
praise the property so levied on, upon actual view; and such householders shall
forthwith return to said officer, under their hands, an estimate of the real valne
of said property. 

§ 453a. That if the words "appraise
ment waived,", or other words of similar import, shall be inserted in any deed,
mortgage, bond, note, bill or written contract hereafter made, any court ren
dering judgment thereon, shall order as part of the judgment that the same,
and any process issued thereon, shall be enforced, and that lands and tenements
may be sold thereunder without appraisement; and such judgment, and any
process issued thereon, shall be enforced, and sales of lands and tenements
made thereunder, without any appraisement or valuation being made of the
property to be sold: Provided, That no order of sale or execution shall be issued
upon such judgment until the expiration of six months from the time of the
rendition of said judgment. 
§ 453J. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with any of the pro
visions of this act, are hereby repealed. 
§ 454. The officer receiving
such return shall forthwith deposit a copy thereof with the clerk of the court
from which the writ issued, and advertise and sell such property, agreeably to the
provisions of this article. 

§ 455. If, upon such return, as
aforesaid, it appear, by the inquisition, that two-thirds of the appraised value of
said lands and tenements, so levied upon, is sufficient to satisfy the execution, with
costs, the judgment on which such execution issued shall not operate as a lien on
the residue of the debtor's estate, to the prejudice of any other judgment cred
itor; but no such property shall be sold for less than two-thirds of the value re
turned in the inquest; and nothing in this section contained shall, in anywise,
extend to affect the sale of lands by the state, but all lands, the property of in
dividuals indebted to the state for any debt or taxes, or in any other manner,
shall be sold without valuation, for the discharge of such debt or taxes, agreeably
to the laws in such cases made and provided. 
§ 456. If the property of
any clerk, sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, constable, or any collector of
state, county, town or township tax, shall be levied on for, or on account of,
any moneys that now are, or may hereafter be, by them collected or received
in their official capacity, the property so levied on shall be sold without valua
tion. 
§ 457. Lands and tenements taken on execution
shall not be sold until the officer cause public notice of the time and place of
sale to be given, for at least thirty days before the day of sale, by advertisement
in some newspaper printed in the county, or, in case no newspaper be printed
in the county, in some newspaper in general circulation therein, and by potting
up an advertisement upon the court-house door, and in five other public places
in the county, two of which shall be in the township where such lands and ten
ements lie. All sales made without such advertisement shall be set aside, on
motion, by the court to which the execution is returnable. 

§ 458. If the court, upon the return of any
writ of execution, for the satisfaction of which any lands or tenements have
been soldl shall, after having carefully examined the proceedings of the officer,
be satisfied that the sale has, in all respects, been made in conformity to the
provisions of this article, the court shall direct the clerk to make an entry on
the journal that the court is satisfied of the legality of such sale, and an order
that the officer make to the purchaser a deed for such lands and tenements; and
the officer, on making such sale, may retain the purchase money in his hands
until the court shall have examined his proceedings, as aforesaid, when he shall
pav the same to the person entitled thereto, agreeably to the order of the court.

§ 459. The sheriff or other officer who, upon
such writ or writs of execution, shall sell the said lands and tenements, or any part thereof, shall make to the purchaser as good and sufficient deed of convey
ance of the lands and tenements sold, as the person or persons against whom
such writ or writs of execution were issued could have made of the same, at or
any time after they became liable to the judgment The deed shall be suffi
cient evidence of the legality of such sale, and the proceedings therein, until the
contrary be proved, and shall vest in the purchaser as good and as perfect an
estate in the premises therein mentioned, as was vested in the party at, or after,
the time when such lands and tenements became liable to the satisfaction of the
judgment; and such deed of conveyance, to be made by the sheriff or other of
ficer, shall recite the execution or executions, or the substance thereof, and the
names of the parties, the amount and date of rendition of each judgment, by
virtue whereof the said lands and tenements were sold as aforesaid, and shall
be executed, acknowledged and recorded as is or may be provided by law, to
perfect the conveyance of real estate in other cases. 

§ 460. The officer who levies
upon goods and chattels, or lands and tenements, or who is charged with the
duty of selling the same, by virtue of any writ of execution, may refuse to pub
lish a notice of the sale thereof, by advertisement in a newspaper, until the
party for whose benefit such execution issued, his agent or attorney, shall ad
vance to such officer 60 much money as will be sufficient to discharge the fees
of the printer for publishing such notice. 

§ 461. Before any officer shall be excused
from giving the notification, mentioned in the last section, he shall demand of
the party for whose benefit the execution was issued, his agent or attorney (pro
vided either of them reside in the county), the fees in said section specified. 

§ 462. All sales of lands
or tenements under execution shall be held at the court house, in the county in
which snch lands and tenements are situated. No sheriff or other officer mak
ing the sale of property, either personal or real, nor any appraiser of such prop
erty, shall, either directly or indirectly, purchase the same; and every purchase,
so made, shall be considered fraudulent and void. 

§ 463. If lands or tenements, levied on as
aforesaid, are not sold upon one execution, other executions may be issued to
sell the property so levied upon. 
§ 464. In all cases
where two or more executions shall be put into the hands of any sheriff or other
officer, and it shall be necessary to levy on real estate to satisfy the same, and
either of the judgment creditors, in whose favor one or more of said executions
are issued, shall require the sheriff or other officer to levy said executions, or so
many thereof as may be required, on separate parcels of the real property of
the judgment debtor or debtors, giving to the officer making the levy on behalf
of the creditor, whose execution may, by the provisions of this article, be enti
tled to a preference, the choice of such part of the real property of the judg
ment debtor or debtors, as will be sufficient, at two-thirds of the appraised value,
to satisfy the same; and in all cases where two or more executions, which are
entitled to no preference over each other, are put into the hands of the same
officer, it shall be the duty of the officer, when required, to levy the same on
separate parcels of the real property of the judgment debtor or debtors, when,
in the opinion of the appraisers, the same may be divided without material in
jury; and if the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient, at two-thirds
of its appraised value, to satisfy ail the executions chargeable thereon, such part
of the same shall be levied on, to satisfy each execution, as will bear the same
proportion in value to the whole, as the amount due to the execution bears to
the amount of all the executions chargeable thereon, as near as may be, accord
ing to the appraised value of each separate parcel of said real property. 

§ 465. If the term of service of the sheriff or other
officer who has made, or shall hereafter make sale of any lands and tenements,
shall expire, or if the sheriff or other officer shall be absent, or be rendered un
able, by death or otherwise, to make a deed of conveyance of the same, any
sncceeding sheriff or other officer, on receiving a certificate from the court from
which the execution issued for the sale of said lands and tenements, signed by
the clerk, by order of said court, setting forth that sufficient proof has been
made to the court that such sale was fairly and legally made; and on tender of
the purchase money, or if the same or any part thereof be paid, then, on proof
of such payment and tender of the balance, if any, may execute to the said pur
chaser or purchasers, or his or their legal representatives, a deed of conveyance
of said lands and tenements so sold. Such deed shall be as good and valid in
law, and have the same effect, as if the sheriff or other officer who made the sale
had executed the same. 

§ 466. If, on any sale made as aforesaid,
there shall be in the hands of the sheriff or other officer, more money than is suf
ficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution, with interest and costs, the sheriff
or other officer shall, on demand, pay the balance to the defendant in execution,
or his legal representatives. 

§ 467. If any judg
ment or judgments, in satisfaction of which any lands or tenements are sold, shall
at any time thereafter be reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect the title of the purchaser or purchasers; but, in such cases, restitution shall be made,
by the judgment creditors, of the money, for which such lands or tenements were
sold, with lawful interest from the day of sale. 

§ 468. No judgment hereto
fore rendered, or which hereafter may be rendered, on which execution shall
not have been taken out and levied before the expiration of one year next after
its rendition, shall operate as a lien on the estate of any debtor, to the prejudice
of any other judgment creditor. But in all cases where judgment has been or
may be rendered in the supreme court, and a special mandate awarded to the
district court to carry the same into execution, the lien of the judgment creditor
shall continue for one year after the first day of the term of the district court to
which such mandate may be directed. Nothing in this section contained shall
be construed to defeat the Hen of any judgment creditor who shall fail to take
out execution and cause a levy to be made, as herein provided, when cuch fail
ure shall be occasioned by appeal, proceedings in error, injunction, or by vacancy
in the office of sheriff or coroner, or the disability of such officer, until one year
after such disability shall be removed. In all cases where real estate has been
or may hereafter be taken on execution and appraised, and twice advertised and
offered for sale, and shall remain unsold for want of bidders, it shall be the duty
of the court from which such execution issued, on motion of the plaintiff, to set
aside such appraisement and order a new one to be made, or to set aside such
levy and appraisement and award a new execution to issue, as the case may re
quire. 

§ 469. The sheriff or other officer, to
whom any writ of execution shall be directed, shall return such writ to the court
to which the same is returnable, within sixty days from the date thereof.

§ 470. In all cases
where judgment is rendered in any court of record within this state, upon any
instrument of writing in which two or more persons are jointly and severally
bound, and it shall be made to appear to the court, by parol or other testimony,
that one or more of said persons so bound, signed the same as surety or bail,
for his or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said court, in
recording the judgment thereon, to certify which of the defendants is principal
debtor, and which are sureties or bail. And the clerk of the court aforesaid
shall issue execution on such judgment, commanding the sheriff or other officer
to cause the money to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements,
of the principal debtor; but for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor
to make the same, that he cause the same to be made of the goods and chattels,
lands and tenements, of the surety or bail. In all cases, the property, both per
sonal and real, of the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the court, shall
be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail shall be taken in
execution. 

§ 471. Each householder, sum
moned to appraise real estate under the provisions of this chapter, shall be al
lowed and receive for his services the sum of fifty cents for each day he may be
so engaged as such appraiser, to be collected on the execution by virtue of
which the property appraised was levied on, if claimed at the time of making the
return of such appraisement. And when any householder, summoned as afore
said, shall fail to appear at the time or place appointed by the officer, and dis
charge his duty as appraiser, he shall, on complaint being made to atiy justice
of the peace of the township in which such householder resides, forfeit and pay
the sum of fifty cents for every such neglect, unless he can render a reasonable
excuse. Such sum shall be collected by said justice, and paid in to the town
ship treasurer, for the use of the township. 
§ 472. If any sheriff or
other officer shall refuse or neglect to execute any writ of execution to him di
rected, which has come to his hands, or shall neglect or refuse to sell any goods
and chattels, lands and tenements; or shall neglect to call an inquest and return
a copy thereof forthwith, to the clerk's office, or shall neglect to return any writ
of execution to the proper court, on or before the return day thereof; or shall
neglect to return a just and perfect inventory of all and singular the goods and
chattels by him taken in execution, unless the said sheriff or other officer shall
return that he has levied and made the amount of the debt, damages and costs;
or shall refuse or neglect, on demand, to pay over to the plaintiff, his agent or
attorney of record, all moneys by him collected or received for the use of said
party, at any time after collecting or receiving the same, except as provided in section four hundred and fifty-eight; or shall neglect or refuse, on demand made
by the defendant, his agent or attorney of record, to pay over all moneys by
him received for any sale made, beyond what is sufficient to satisfy the writ or
writs of execution, with interest and legal costs, such sheriff or other officer
shall, on motion in court, and two days' notice thereof, in writing, be amerced
in the amount of said debt, damages and costs, with ten per cent, thereon, to
and for the use of said plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be. 

§ 473. If any clerk of a court shall neglect
Or refuse, on demand made by the person entitled thereto, his agent or attorney
of record, to pay over all money by him received in his official capacity, for the
use of such persons, every such clerk may be amerced, and the proceedings
against him and his sureties shall be the same as provided for, in the foregoing section, against sheriffs and their sureties. 
§ 474. When the cause of amercement
is for refusing to pay over money collected as aforesaid, the said sheriff or other
officer shall not be amerced in a greater sum than the amount so withheld, with
ten per cent, thereon. 

§ 475. When an
sxecution is issued to the sheriff of any county other than that in which the
judgment was rendered, the sheriff, after indorsing the date of its reception
thereon, shall deliver the same to the clerk of the district court of his county,
who shall thereupon enter the same in the execution docket in the same manner
as if it had issued from the court of which he is clerk; and before the sheriff
shall return any such writ, he shall cause his return to be entered in like man
ner. 

§ 476. When execution shall be
issued in any county in this state, and directed to the sheriff or coroner of an
other county, it shall be lawful for such sheriff or coroner having the execution,
after having discharged all the duties required of him by law, to inclose such exe
cution, by mail, to the clerk of the court who issued the same. On proof being
made by such sheriff or coroner, that the execution was mailed soon enough to
have reached the office where it was issued within the time prescribed by law,
the sheriff or coroner shall not be liable for any amercement or penalty if it do
not reach the office in due time. 
§ 477. No sheriff
shall forward, by mail, any money made on any such execution, unless he shall be
specially instructed to do it by the plaintiff, his agent or attorney of record. In
all cases of a motion to amerce a sheriff, or other officer of any county other than
that from which the execution issued, notice in writing shall be given to such
officer, as hereinbefore required, by leaving it with him, or at his office, at least
fifteen days before the day on which such motion shall be made. All amerce
ments so procured shall be entered on the record of the court, and shall have
the same force and effect as a judgment. 
§ 478. Each and every
surety of any sheriff or other officer may be made party to the judgment ren
dered as aforesaid, against the sheriff or other officer, by action, to be com
menced and prosecuted as in other cases; but the goods and chattels, lands and
tenements of any such surety shall not be liable to be taken on execution, when
sufficient goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the sheriff or other officer,
against whom execution may be issued, can be found to satisfy the same. Noth
ing herein contained shall prevent either party from proceeding against such
sheriff or other officer, by attachment, at his election. 

§ 479. In cases where a sheriff or other
officer may be amerced, and shall not have collected the amount of the original
judgment, he shall be permitted to sue out an execution and collect the amount
of said judgment, in the name of the original plaintiff, for his use. 
§ 480. When prop
erty, liable to an execution against several persons, is sold thereon, and more
than a due proportion of the judgment is laid upon the property of .one of them,
or one of them pays, without a sale, more than his proportion, he may compel
contribution from the others; and when a judgment is against several, and is
upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays
the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale of his property or before
sale, he may compel repayment from the principal; in such case, the person so
paying or contributing is entitled to the benefit of the judgment, to enforce
contribution or repayment, if within ten days after his payment he file, with the
clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and
claim to contribution or repayment. Upon a filing of such notice, the clerk
shall make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket 

§ 481. When
a judgment debtor has not personal or real property, subject to levy on execu
tion, sufficient to satisfy the judgment, any equitable interest which he may have
in real estate, as mortgagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, or any interest he mar
have in any banking, turnpike, bridge, or other joint stock company, or any in
terest he may have in any money, contracts, claims, or choses in action, due or
to become due to him, or in any judgment or decree, or any money, goods or
effects which he may have in the possession of any person, body politic or cor
porate, shall be subject to the payment of such judgment, by action, or as here
inafter prescribed. 

§ 482. When an executioi.
against a judgment debtor, or one of several debtors in the same judgment, is
sued to the sheriff of the county where he resides, or, if he does not reside
in the state, to the sheriff of the county where judgment was rendered, or a
transcript of a justice's judgment has been filed, is returned unsatisfied, in whole
or in part, the judgment creditor is entitled to an order of the probate judge,
or judge of the district court, of the county to which the execution was issued,
requiring such debtor to appear and answer concerning his property, before such
judge, or a referee appointed by such judge, at a time and place specified in such
order, within the county to which the execution was issued. 

§ 483. After the issuing of an
execution against property, and upon the affidavit of the judgment creditor, hia
agent or attorney, that the judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refusee
to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, the probate judge or
judge of the district court of the county in which the order may be served, may,
by order, require the judgment debtor to appear, at a time and place in said
county, to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon
be had, for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the
satisfaction of the judgment, as hereinafter prescribed. 

§ 484. Instead of the order requiring the attendance
of the judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sections, the judge
may, upon proof to his satisfaction, by affidavit of the party or otherwise, that
there is danger of the debtor leaving the state, or concealing himself, to avoid
the examination herein mentioned, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff to arrest
him and bring him before such judge, within the county in which the debtor
may be arrested. Such a warrant can be issued only by a probate judge, or the
judge of the district court, of the county in which such debtor resides or may
be arrested. Upon being brought before the judge, he shall be examined on
oath, and other witnesses may be examined on either side; and if, on such ex
amination, it appear that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state, and
that he has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, he
may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, in such sum as the judge may
prescribe, with one or more sureties, that he will, from time to time, attend for
examination before the judge or referee, as shall bo directed. In default of en
tering into such undertaking, he may be committed to the jail of the county, by
warrant of the judge, as for a contempt. 

§ 485. No person shall,
on examination pursuant to this article, be excused from answering any ques
tion on the ground that his examination will tend to convict him of a fraud;
but his answer shall not be used as evidence against him in a prosecution for
such fraud. 
§ 486. After the
issuing of execution against property, any person indebted to the judgment
debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof ai
may be necessary to satisfy the execution; and the sheriff's receipt shall be a
sufficient discharge for the amount so paid, or directed to be credited by the
judgment creditor on the execution. 

§ 487. After the issuing or
return of an execution against property of a judgment debtor, or of any one of
several debtors in the same judgment, where it is made to appear by affidavit
or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the judge, that there is reason to believe that
any person or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted
to Mm, the judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation, or any
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place within the
county in which such person or corporation may be served with the order to
answer, and answer the same. . The judge may, also, in his discretion, require
notice of such proceeding to be given to any party in the action, in such manner
as may seem to him proper. 
§ 488. Witnesses may be required, upon the order
of the judge, to appear and testify upon any proceedings under this article, in
the same manner as upon the trial of an issue. 
§ 489. The party or witness may be required to
attend before the judge, or before a referee appointed by the court or judge.
All examinations and answers before a judge or a referee, under this article,
must be on oath, and reduced to writing; but when a corporation answers, the
answer must be on oath of an officer thereof. 
§ 490. The judge
may order any property of the judgment debtor, not exempt by law, in the hands
either of himself or any other person or corporation, or due to the judgment
debtor, to be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment, and may enforce
the same by proceedings for contempt, in case of refusal or disobedience; but the
earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within three months
next preceding the order, cannot be so applied, when it is made to appear, by
the debtor's affidavit or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use
of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor. 

§ 490a. That the earn
ings of a debtor, who is a resident of this state, for his personal services at any
time within three months next preceding the issuing of an execution, attach
ment or garnishment process, cannot be applied to the payment of his debts
when it is made to appear by the debtor' s affidavit or otherwise that such earn
ings are necessary for the maintenance of a family supported wholly or partly
by his labor: Provided, That at the time of filing such affidavit the debtor shall
notify the plaintiff or his agent or attorneys thereof in writing: And provided.
That nothing herein contained shall prevent the adverse party from controvert
ing the matters sought to be proven by such affidavit by counter affidavit, or if
sought to be proven in any other manner the same may be controverted by any
competent evidence: And provided further, That such counter affidavit shall be
filed within twenty-four hours after the notice of the filing of the said debtor's
affidavit, and final hearing shall be had thereon at a time to be fixed by the
court within ten days from the notice of the filing of the debtor' s affidavit if
pending in the justices' court, and if pending in the district court it shall be
tried at the first term held after filing such affidavit. 

§ 491. The judge
may also, by order, appoint the sheriff of the proper county, or other suitable
person, a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner
and with like authority as if the appointment was made by the court. The judge
may also, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property of the
judgment debtor, not exempt by law, and any interference therewith. 

§ 492. If
it shall appear that the judgment debtor has any equitable interest in real estate
in the county in which proceedings are had, as mortgagor or mortgagee, or oth
erwise, and the interest of said debtor can be ascertained as between himself
and the person or persons holding the legal estate, or the person or persons
having a lien on or interest in the same, without controversy as to the interest
of such person or persons holding such legal estate or interest therein, or lien on
the same, the receiver may be ordered to sell and convey such real estate, or the
debtor's interest therein. Such sale shall be conducted, in all respects, in the
same manner aa is provided by this code for the sale of real estate upon execu
tion; and the proceedings of sale shall, before the execution of the deed, be
approved by the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the transcript has
been filed as aforesaid, aa in case of sale upon execution. 

§ 493. If the sheriff shall be ap
pointed receiver, he and his sureties shall be liable on his official bond for the
faithful discharge of his duties as receiver, and no additional oath shall be re
quired of him; if any other person shall be appointed receiver, he shall give a
written undertaking, in such sum as shall be prescribed by the judge, with one
or more sureties, to the effect that he will faithfully discharge the duties of re
ceiver, and he shall also take an oath to the same effect before acting as such
receiver. The undertaking mentioned in this section shall be to the state of
Kansas, and actions may be prosecuted for a breach thereof, by any person in
terested, in the same manner as upon a sheriff's official bond. 
§ 494. The receiver shall be vested
with the property and effects ana rights in action of the judgment debtor, not
exempt by law, or such part thereof as the court or judge may order, and may
«ue for, collect, and recover, and dispose of the same, and apply the proceeds
according to the order of the court or judge, and generally may do such acts
concerning the property as the court or judge may authorize. 
§ 495. The court or
judge may order the delivery, to the receiver, by the judgment debtor, or any
other person in whose possession the same may be, any notes, bills, accounts,
contracts, books or other evidences of indebtedness or right in action, of the
judgment debtor, and may enforce such order by attachment, as for a contempt.

§ 496. The judge or referee, acting under the
provisions of this article, shall have power to continue his proceedings, from
time to time, until they shall be completed. 

§ 497. The judge may, in his discretion, order a ref
erence to a referee, agreed upon or appointed by him, to report the evidence or
the facts. 
§ 498. If any person, party or witness disobey an
order of the judge or referee, duly served, such person, party or witness may
be punished by the judge, as for a contempt. 
§ 499. The order mentioned in sections four

indebted to him; and thereupon the clerk shall issue an order, requiring such
person or corporation to answer, on or before a day to be named in the order,
not less than ten nor more than twenty days from the date of issuing the same,
all interrogatories that may be propounded by the judgment creditor, concern
ing such indebtedness or property. 
§ 503. The judgment cred
itor, or his attorney, shall prepare interrogatories concerning such indebtedness
or property, a copy of which shall be served on the garnishee at the time of the
service of the order, or within three days thereafter. And the garnishee shall,

person of the debtor may be issued upon any judgment for the payment of
money: First, When the judgment debtor has removed, or begun to remove,
any of his property out of the jurisdiction of the court, with intent to prevent
the collection of money due on the judgment. Second, When he has property,
rights in action, evidences of debt, or some interest or stock in some corpora
tion or company, which he fraudulently conceals with the like intent. Third,
When he has assigned or disposed 6f all, or any part, of his property, or rights
in action, or has converted the same into money, with intent to defraud his
creditors, or with the intent to prevent such property from being taken in exe
cution. Fourth, When he fraudulently contracted the debt, or incurred the
obligation, upon which the judgment was rendered. Fifth, When he was ar
rested, on an order, before judgment, and has not been discharged as an insolv
ent debtor, or the order has not been set aside, as improperly made. 

§ 507. An exe
cution against the person of the debtor, except as prescribed in section five
hundred and nine, can be issued only when the same is allowed by the supreme
court, the district court, or any judge of either, upon being satisfied, by the affi
davit of the judgment creditor, or his attorney, and such other evidence as may
be presented, of the existence of one or more of the particulars mentioned in section five hundred and six. 

§ 508. A justice of the peace may issue
an execution against the person of a judgment debtor, upon being satisfied of
the existence of one or more of the same particulars, by the like affidavit and
evidence. 
§ 509. In all cases in
which the judgment debtor was arrested before judgment, and has not been re
leased from imprisonment by an application for relief, as an insolvent debtor,
and where the order for such arrest has not been adjudged improper, an execu
tion against the person of such judgment debtor may issue of course. 
§ 510. Any person taken in exe
cution as aforesaid, shall be discharged by delivering or setting off to the officer

§ 511. Any person impris
oned under the provisions of this article shall be entitled to prison bounds, which
shall be co-extensive with the county, upon executing an undertaking, with one
or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by the sheriff, to the effect that if the
debtor go beyond the prison bounds before being discharged according to law,
he will pay to the plaintiff the amount of the execution, with interest and costs;
but in case the person shall be out of jail, in prison bounds, the judgment cred
itor, upon whose judgment he was imprisoned, shall be entitled to execution
against the lands and tenements, goods and chattels of the debtor, and all other
remedies prescribed by this code for the collection of debts. 

§ 512. The death of a person un
der arrest in an execution does not satisfy the judgment; but an execution may
issue thereon as if no arrest had been made. 

§ 513. If a person, imprisoned under an
order of arrest made before judgment, is not charged in execution, within ten
days after judgment, he shall be discharged from such imprisonment 

§ 514. Incases of commitment under
this article, or upon arrest before or after judgment, in civil cases, the person

rendered, on such terms as may be just. 

§ 515. If the execution be for the deliv
ery of the possession of real or personal property, it shall require the officer to
deliver the same, particularly describing the property, to the party entitled
thereto, and may, at the same time, require the officer to satisfy any costs or
damages, recovered in the same judgment, out of the goods and chattels of the
party against whom it was rendered; and, for the want of such goods and chat
tels, then out of the lands and tenements; and in this respect it shall be deemed
an execution against the property. 
§ 516. When the judgment is not for
the recovery of money or real property, the same may be enforced by attach
ment, by the court rendering judgment, upon motion made, or by a rule of the
court upon the defendant; but in either case, notice of the motion or a service
of a copy of the rule shall be made on the defendant, a reasonable time before
the order of attachment is made. 

§ 517. In special cases, not hereinbe
fore provided for, the execution shall conform to the judgment or order of the
court. When a judgment for any specified amount, and also for the sale of
specific real or personal property, shall have been rendered, and an amount,
sufficient to satisfy the amount of the debt or damages and costs, be not made
from the sale of property specified, an execution may issue for the balance, as
in other cases. 

§ 518. In all cases in which a judgment
shall be rendered by a justice of the peace, the party in whose favor the judg
ment shall be rendered may file a transcript of such judgment in the office of
the clerk of the district court of the county in which the judgment was rendered;
and thereupon the clerk shall, on the day on which the same shall be filed,
enter the case on the appearance docket, together with the amount of the
judgment and time of filing the transcript; and shall also enter the same on the
judgment docket, as in case of a judgment rendered in the court of which he is
clerk. 

§ 519. Such judgment shall be a lien upon the
real estate of the judgment debtor, from the day of filing the transcript, in the
same manner and to the same extent as if the judgment had been rendered in
the district court. 
§ 520. Execution may be issued thereon, to the sher
iff, by the clerk of the court, in the same manner as if the judgment had been
taken in court; and the sheriff shall execute and return the same, as other exe
cutions; and in case of sale of real estate, his proceedings shall be examined and
approved by the court as in other cases. 
§ 521. The justice of the peace
shall certify on the transcript the amount, if any, paid on such judgment. 
§ 522. If such judgment
becomes dormant, or if any of the parties thereto die before the same is satisfied,
it may be revived in the same manner as other judgments in the district court;
and a certified copy of the entry of such transcript may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the district court of any other county, and shall be a lien on the real
estate of the debtor in such county, from the date of the filing of such copy.

§ 523. The defendant, in an ac
tion for the recovery of money only, may, at any time before the trial, serve
upon the plaintiff or his attorney an offer, in writing, to allow judgment to be
taken against him for the sum specified therein. If the plaintiff accept the offer
and give notice thereof to the defendant or his attorney, within five days after
the offer* was served, the offer, and an affidavit that the notice of acceptance
was delivered within the time limited, may be filed by the plaintiff, or the de
fendant may file the acceptance, with a copy of the offer, verified by affidavit;
and in either case, the offer and acceptance shall be noted in the journal, and
judgment shall be rendered accordingly. If the notice of acceptance be not
given in the period limited, the offer shall be deemed withdrawn, and shall not
be given in evidence or mentioned on the trial. If the plaintiff fails to obtain
judgment for more than was offered by the defendant, he shall pay the defend
ant's costs from the time of the offer. 

§ 524. The making of an offer, pursuant to the
provisions contained in the foregoing section, shall not be a cause for a contin
uance of an action or a postponement of the trial. 

§ 525. Parties to a question, which might
be the subject of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon a case contain
ing the facta upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission of
the same to any court, which would have jurisdiction if an action had been
brought. But it must appear, by affidavit, that the controversy is real, and the
proceedings in good faith to determine the rights of the parties. The court
shall thereupon hear and determine the case, and render judgment as if an
action were pending. 

§ 526. The case, the submission,
and a copy of the judgment, shall constitute the record. 
§ 527. The judgment shall be with
costs, may be enforced, and shall be subject to reversal, in the same manner as
if it had been rendered in an action, unless otherwise provided in the submis
sion. 

§ 528. After an action for the
recovery of money is brought, the defendant may offer in court to confess judg
ment for part of the amount claimed, or part of the causes involved in the
action; whereupon, if the plaintiff, being present, refuse to accept such confes
sion of judgment in full of his demands against the defendant in the action, or,
having had such notice that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of the
time of making it, as the court shall deem reasonable, fail to attend, and on the
trial do not recover more than was so offered to be confessed, such plaintiff
shall pay all the costs of the defendant incurred after the offer. The offer
shall not be deemed to be an admission of the cause of action, or the amount
to which the plaintiff is entitled, nor be given in evidence upon the trial. 

§ 529. A surety
may maintain an action against his principal, to compel him to discharge the
debt or liability for which the surety is bound, after the same has become due.

§ 530. A surety may maintain an action
against his principal, to obtain indemnity against the debt or liability for which
he is bound, before it is due, whenever any of the grounds exist, upon which.

used on the hearing, the notice shall state that fact, and it shall be served a reason
able time before the hearing. 

§ 535. Notices of motions, mentioned in
this article, may be served by a sheriff, coroner or constable, the party or his at

case in such court, after the judgment of the court below shall have been set
aside or reversed. Second, When the judgment directs the delivery of the pos
session of lands or tenements by the plaintiff in error, he will not commit or
suffer to be committed any waste thereon; and if the judgment be affirmed by
the court above, or if judgment be rendered against the plaintiff upon the fur

for Buch judgment. The court reversing such judgment or final order shall not
issue execution in causes that are removed before Uiem on error, on which they
pronounce judgment as aforesaid, but shall send a special mandate to the court
below, as the case may require, to award execution thereupon; and such court,
to which such special mandate is sent, shall proceed in such cases in the same
manner as if such judgment or final order had been rendered therein. In cases
decided by the supreme court, when the facts are agreed to by the parties, or
found by the court below, or a referee, and when it does not appear, by excep
tion or otherwise, that euch findings are against the evidence in the case, the su
preme court shall send a mandate to the court below, directing it to render such
judgment in the premises as it should have rendered on the facts agreed to or
found in the case. 

§ 560. It shall be the duty of the judges of
the supreme court to prepare, and file with the papers in each case, full notes of
the opinion of the court upon the questions of law arising in the case, within
sixty days after the decision of the same; and the opinion so filed shall be
treated as a part of the record in the case, but no costs shall be charged there
for, except for copies thereof ordered by a party; and no mandate shall be sent
to the court below, until the opinion provided for by this section has been filed.

case in the supreme court shall be stated, in writing, by the judge delivering the
opinion of the court, and filed with the papers of the case, which shall be con
fined to points of law arising from the facts in the case, that have been deter
mined by the court; and the syllabus shall be submitted to the judges concurring
therein, for revisal before filing thereof, and it shall be filed with the papers,
without alteration, unless by consent of the judges concurring therein; and a
copy of such syllabus shall, in all cases, be sent to the court below, by the clerk
of the supreme court, with the mandate provided for by section five hundred
and fifty-nine of this act. 
§ 562. When a judgment or final order is re
versed, the plaintiff in error shall recover his costs, including the costs of the
transcript of the proceedings, or case made, filed with the petition in error; and
when reversed in part and affirmed in part, costs shall be equally divided be
tween the parties.

the clerk shall not be a ground of error, until the same has been presented and
acted upon in the court in which the mistake, neglect or omission occurred.
§ 564. Writs of error and certiorari, to re
verse, vacate or modify judgments or final orders, in civil cases, are abolished;
but courts shall have the same power to compel complete and perfect transcripts
of the proceedings containing the judgment or final order sought to be reversed,
to be furnished, as they heretofore had under writs of error and certiorari.
§ 565. If the
judgment of a justice of the peace, taken on error, as herein provided, to the
district court, be affirmed, it shall be the duty of such court to render judg
ment against the plaintiff in error for the costs of suit, and award execution
therefor; and the court shall thereupon order the clerk to certify its decision in
the premises to the justice, that the judgment affirmed may be enforced, as if
such proceedings in error had not been taken; or such court may award execu
tion to carry into effect the judgment of such justice, in the same manner as
if such judgment had been rendered in the district court. 
§ 566. When the proceedings of a justice
of the peace are taken in error to the district court, in the manner aforesaid,
and the judgment of such justice shall be reversed or set aside, the court shall
render judgment of reversal, and for the costs that have occurred up to that
time, in favor of the plaintiff in error, and award execution therefor; and the
same shall be retained by the court for trial and final judgment, as in cases of
appeal. 

§ 567.
That when an order, discharging or modifying an attachment or a temporary in
junction, shall be made in any case, and the party who obtained such attachment

provided for in this act, and the costs of filing and entering such statement
shall be recovered as part of the costs of enforcing such hens. 
§ 633. All claims for liens and rights of action to
recover therefor under this act shall be assignable so as to vest in the assignee
all rights and remedies herein given, subject to all defenses thereto that might
be made if such assignment had not been made. Where a statement has been
filed and recorded as herein provided, such assignment may be made by an en
try, on the same page of the mechanics' lien docket containing the record of
the lien, signed by the claimant or his lawful representative, and attested by the
clerk; or such assignment may be made by a separate instrument in writing.

§ 634. Any lien provided for by this act may be en
forced by civil action in the district court of the county in which the land is situ
ated, and such action shall be brought within one year from the time of the filing
of said lien with the clerk of said court: Provided, That where a promissory note
is given such action may be brought at any time within one year from the matnrity
of said note. The practice, pleading and proceedings in such action shall
conform to the rules prescribed by the code of civil procedure as far as the same
may be applicable; and in case of action brought, any lien statement may be
amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice as pleadings may be in any
matter, except as to the amount claimed. 
§ 635. In such actions all persons whose liens are filed as
herein provided, and other incumbrancers, shall be made parties, and issues
shall be made and trials had as in other cases. Where such action is brought
by a sub-contractor, or other person not the original contractor, such original
contractor shall be made a party defendant, and shall at his own expense defend
against the claim of every sub-contractor, or other person claiming a lien under
this act, and if he fails to make such defense the owner may make the same at
the expense of such contractor; and until all such claims, costs and expenses
are finally adjudicated, and defeated or satisfied, the owner shall be entitled to
retain from the contractor the amount thereof, and such costs and expenses as
he may be required to pay: Provided, That if the sheriff of the county in which
such action is pending shall make return that he is unable to find such original
contractor, the court may proceed to adjudicate the hens upon the land and

render judgment to enforce the same with costs. 
§ 636. If several actions brought to enforce the
Hens herein provided for are pending at the time, the court may order them to
be consolidated; and in any action brought to enforce a lien under this act, if
the building or other improvement is still in course of construction, the court,
on application of any party engaged in furnishing labor or materials for such
building or improvement, may stay the trial thereof for a reasonable time to
permit the filing of a hen statement by such party under the provisions of this
act. 
§ 637. In all cases where judgments may be ren
dered in favor of any person or persons to enforce a hen under the provisions
of this act, the real estate or other property shall be ordered to be sold as in
other cases of sales of real estate, such sale to be without prejudice to the rights
of any prior incumbrancers, owner or other person not a party to the action.

§ 638. In any action brought by any artisan or
day laborer to enforce any hen under this act, where judgment be rendered for
plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover a reasonable attorney's fee to
be fixed by the court, which shall be taxed as costs in the action. 
§ 638<z. If any lien or liens shall be filed
under the provisions of this act and no action to foreclose any of said hens shall
have been commenced, the owner of the land may file his petition in the dis
trict court of the county in which said land is situated, making said lien claim
ants defendants therein, and praying for an adjudication of said lien or liens so
claimed, and if any such lien claimant shall fail to establish his lien, the court
may tax against said claimant the whole, or such portion of the costs of such
action as may be just: Provided, That if no action to foreclose or adjudicate
any hen filed under the provisions of this act shall be instituted within one year
from the filing of said lien, the clerk of the district court shall enter under the
head of "Remarks,1' in the mechanics' lien docket hereinbefore named, that
said lien is canceled by limitation of law. 
§ 638i. If the proceeds of the sale be insufficient to
pay all the claimants, then the court shall order them to be paid in proportion
to the amount due each. 
§ 638c. The erecting or constructing of a light
ning rod or rods on any buildings shall not be considered such an improvement,
fixture, or attachment, as to come under the provision of section one (1) of this
act. 
§ 638c?. The contractor or owner mentioned in section 1 of
this act may execute a bond to the state of Kansas for the use of all persons in
whose favor liens might accrue by virtue of this act, conditioned for the payment
of all claims which might be the basis of liens; which bond shall be in a sum
not less than the contract price, and with good and sufficient sureties, whose
qualifications shall be verified in accordance with section 723 of the code of civil
procedure, such surety as shall be approved by the clerk of the district court in
the county in which the property is situated, and may file such bond in the of
fice of said clerk; and when such bond is so approved and filed no lien shall
attach under this act, and if when such bond is filed hens have already been
filed, such lien shall be discharged. Suits may be brought on said bond by any
person interested. 


§ 638*. That whenever
any public officer shall, under the laws of the state, enter into contract in any
sum exceeding one hundred dollars, with any person or persons, for purpose of
making any public improvements, or constructing any public building or mak
ing repairs on the same, such officer shall take from the party contracted with a
bond with good and sufficient sureties to the state of Kansas, in a sum not less
than the sum total in the contract, conditioned that such contractor or contract
ors shall pay all indebtedness incurred for labor or material furnished in the
construction of said public building or in making said public improvements.

§ 638/ That such bond shall be filed in the office of the
clerk of the district court of the county in which such public improvement is
to be made or such public building is to be erected; and any person to whom
there is due any sum for labor or material furnished, as stated in section one of
this act, or his assigns, may bring an action on said bond for the recovery of
said indebtedness: Provided, That no action shall be brought on said bond after
six months from the completion of said public improvements or public build
ings. 

§ 639. The district court may grant a
divorce for any of the following causes: First, When either of the parties had
a former husband or wife living at the time of the subsequent marriage. Second,
Abandonment for one year. Third, Adultery. Fourth, Impotency. Fifth,
When the wife, at the time of the marriage, was pregnant by another than her
husband. Sixth, Extreme cruelty. Seventh, Fraudulent contract. Eighth,
Habitual drunkenness. Ninth, Gross neglect of duty. Tenth, The conviction
of a felony, and imprisonment in the penitentiary therefor, subsequent to the
marriage. 

§ 610. The plaintiff in an action for divorce must
have been an actual resident, iu good faith, of the state, for one year next preced
ing the filing of the petition, and a resident of the county in which the action
is brought at the time the petition is filed. 

§ 641. The petition must be verified as
true, by the affidavit of the plaintiff. A summons may issue thereon, and shall be
served, or publication made, as in other cases. When service by publication is
proper, a copy of the petition, with a copy of the publication notice attached
thereto, shall, within three days after the first publication is made, be inclosed
in an envelope addressed to the defendant, at his or her place of residence,
postage paid, and deposited in the nearest post office, unless the plaintiff shall
make aud tile an affidavit that such residence is unknown to the plaintiff, and
cannot be ascertained by any means within the control of the plaintiff. 

§ 642. The defendant, in his or her answer, may allege
a cause for a divorce against the plaintiff, and may have the same relief there
upon as he or she vould be entitled to for a like cause if he or she were plaintiff.
When new matter is set up in the answer, it shall be verified as to such new
matter by the affidavit of the defendant. 
§ 643. When the parties appear to be in equal wrong,
the court may in its discretion refuse to grant a divorce, and in any such case
or in any other case where a divorce is refused, the court may for good cause
shown make such order as may be proper for the custody, maintenance and
education of the children, and for the control and equitable division and dis
position of the property of the parties, or of either of them, as may be proper,
equitable and just, having due regard to the time and manner of acquiring such
property, whether the title thereto be in either or both of said parties. 

§ 644. After a petition has been filed in an action
for divorce and alimony, or for alimony alone, fhe court, or a judge thereof in
vacation, may make and enforce by attachment such order to restrain the dispo
sition of the property of the parties or of either of them, and for the use, man
agement and control thereof, or for the control of the children and support of
the wife during the pendency of the action, as may be right and proper; and
may also make such order relative to the expenses of the suit as will insure to
the wife an efficient* preparation of her case; and on granting a divorce in fa
vor of the wife or refusing one on the application of the husband, the court may
require the husband to pay such reasonable expenses of the wife in the prose
cution or defense of the action as may be just and proper, considering the re
spective parties and the means and property of each. 

§ 645. When a divorce is granted, the court shall
make provision for guardianship, custody, support and education of the minor
•children of the marriage, and may modify or change any order in this respect,
henever circumstances render such change proper. 

§ 646. When a divorce shall be granted by reason of
the fault or aggression of the husband, the wife shall be restored to her maiden
name if she so desires, and also to all the property, lands, tenements, heredita
ments owned by her before her marriage or acquired by her in her own right
after such marriage, and not previously disposed of, and shall be allowed such
alimony out of the husband' s real and personal property as the court shall think
reasonable, having due regard to the property which came to him by marriage
and the value of his real and personal estate at the time of said divorce; which
alimony may be allowed to her in real or personal property, or both, or by de
creeing to her such sum of money, payable either in gross or in installments, as
the court may deem just and equitable. If the divorce shall be granted by
reason of the fault or aggression of the wife, the court shall order restoration to
her of the whole of her property, lands, tenements and hereditaments owned by
her before, or by her separately acquired after such marriage, and not previously
disposed of, and also such share of her husband' s real and personal property,
or both, as to the court may appear just and reasonable; and she shall be barred
of all right in all the remaining lands of which her husband may at any time
have been seized. And as to such property, whether real or personal, as shall
have been acquired by the parties jointly during their marriage, whether the title thereto be in either or both of said parties, the court shall make such divis
ion between the parties respectively as may appear just and reasonable, by a di
vision of the property in kind, or by setting the same apart to one of the parties,
and requiring the other thereof to pay such sum as may be just and proper to
effect a fair and just division thereof. But in case of a finding by the court,
that such divorce should be granted on account of the fault or aggression of the
wife, the court may in its discretion set apart such a portion of the wife' s sepa
rate estate as may seem proper for the support of the children, issue of the mar
riage. 

§ 647. A divorce granted at the instance
of one party shall operate as a dissolution of the marriage contract as to both,
and shall be a bar to any claim of the party for whose fault it was granted in
or to the property of the other, except in cases where actual fraud shall have
been committed by or on behalf of the successful party. Every judgment of
divorcement granted by a district court shall be final and conclusive, unless ap
pealed from within the time and in the manner herein provided. A party de
siring to appeal from a judgment granting a divorce, must within ten days after
such judgment is rendered file a written notice in the office of the clerk of such
court, duly entitled in such action, stating that it is the intention of such party
to appeal from such judgment; and unless such notice be filed no appeal shall
be had or taken in such cause; if notice be filed as aforesaid, the party filing
the same may commence proceedings in error for the reversal or modification
of such judgment at any time within four months from the date of the decree
appealed from, and not thereafter; but whether a notice be filed as herein pro
vided, or not, or whether proceedings in error be commenced as herein provided,
or not, it shall be unlawful for either party to such divorce suit to marry any
other person within six months from the date of the decree of divorcement; and
if notice be filed and proceedings in error be commenced as hereinbefore pro
vided, then it shall be unlawful for either party to such cause to marry any other
person until the expiration of thirty days from the day on which final judgment
shall be rendered by the appellate court on such appeal; and every person mar
rying contrary to the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of bigamy,
and such marriage be absolutely void. 

§ 647a. Every person convicted of bigamy as such of
fense as defined in the foregoing section shall be punished by imprisonment in
the penitentiary for a term of not less than one year nor more than three years.

§ 647S. Every decree of divorce
shall recite the day and date when the judgment was rendered in the cause, and
that the decree does not become absolute and take effect until the expiration of
six months from said time. 
§ 648. When either of the parties to a marriage
shall be incapable, from want of age or understanding, of contracting sucli mar
riage, the same may be declared void by the district court, in an action brought
by the incapable party; but the children of such marriage, begotten before the
same is annulled, shall be legitimate. Cohabitation after such incapacity ceases,
shall be a sufficient defense to any such action. 

§ 649. The wife may obtain alimony from the husband
without a divorce, in an action brought for that purpose in the district court, for
any of the causes for which a divorce may be granted. The husband may make
the same defense to such action as he might to an action for divorce, and may,
for sufficient cause, obtain a divorce from the wife in such action. 

§ 650. Upon the trial of an action for a divorce, or
for alimony, the court may admit proof of the admissions of the parties to be
received in evidence, carefully excluding 6uch as shall appear to have been ob
tained by connivance, fraud, coercion or other improper means. Proof of co
abitation, and reputation of the marriage of the parties, may be received as>
evidence of the marriage. But no divorce shall be granted without proof. 
§ 651. A wife who resides in this
state at the time of applying for a divorce, shall be deemed a resident of this
state, though her husband resides elsewhere. 
§ 651a. In any action for a divorce here
after tried, the parties thereto, or either of them, shall be competent to testify
in like manner, and respecting any fact necessary or proper to be proven, as
parties to other civil actions are allowed to testify. 

§ 652. The writ of quo warranto, and proceed
ings by information in the nature of quo warranto, are abolished, and the
remedies heretofore obtainable in those forms may be had by civil action. 

§ 653. Such action may be brought in the su
preme court or in the district court, in the following cases:
First, When any person shall usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold or ex
ercise any public office, or shall claim any franchise within this state, or any
office in any corporation created by authority of this state;
Second, Whenever any public officer shall have done or suffered any act
which, by the provisions of law, shall work a forfeiture of his office;
Third, When any association or number of persons shall act within this.
state as a corporation without being legally incorporated;
Fourth, When any corporation do or admit acts which amount to a sur
render or a forfeiture of their rights and privileges as a corporation, or when
any corporation abuses its power or exercises powers not conferred by law;
Fifth, Where any corporation claims, by virtue of a congressional grant,
any of the public lands or Indian lands to which the Indian title or right of oc
cupancy has been extinguished;
Sixth, For any other cause for which a remedy might have been heretofore
obtained by writ of quo warranto, or information in the nature of quo warranto.

§ 654. When the action is brought by the at
torney general or the county attorney of any county of his own motion, or when
directed to do 60 by competent authority, it shall be prosecuted in the name of
the state, but where the action is brought by a person claiming an interest in the
office, franchise or corporation, or claiming any interest adverse to the franchise
gift or grant, which is the subject of the action, it shall be prosecuted in the
name and under the direction, and at the expense of such persons; whenever
the action is brought against a person for usurping an office by the attorney gen
eral or the county attorney, he shall set forth in the petition the name of the
person rightfully entitled to the office, and his right or title thereto; when the
action in such case is brought by the person claiming title, he may claim and re
cover any damage he may have sustained. 

§ 655. In every case contesting
the right to an office, judgment shall be rendered according to the rights of the
parties, and for the damages the plaintiff or person entitled may have sustained,
if any, to the time of the judgment. 

§ 656. If judgment be rendered in
favor of the plaintiff or person entitled, he shall proceed to exercise the func
tions of the office, after he has been qualified as required by law; and the court
shall order the defendant to deliver over all the books and papers in his custody
or within his power, belonging to the office from which he shall have been
ousted. 

§ 657. If the defendant shall refuse or neglect
to deliver over the books and papers, pursuant to the order, the court, or judge
thereof, shall enforce the order by attachment and imprisonment 

§ 658. When judgment is rendered in favor
of the plaintiff, he may, if he has not claimed his damages in the action, have a
separate action for the damages at any time within one year after the judgment.
The court may give judgment of ouster against the defendant, and exclude him
from the office, franchise or corporate rights; and in cases of corporations, that
the same shall be dissolved. 

§ 659. If judgment be rendered against any corporation,
or against any persons claiming to be a corporation, the court may cause the costs
to be collected by execution against the persons claiming to be a corporation,
or by attachment against the directors or other officers of the corporation, and
may restrain any disposition of the effects of the corporation, appoint a receiver
of its property and effects, take an account, and make a distribution thereof
among the creditors and persons entitled. 

§ 6fJ0. Every person restrained of his liberty, under any
pretense whatever, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause
of the restraint and shall be delivered therefrom when illegal. 

§ 661. Application for the writ shall
be made by petition, signed and verified either by the plaintiff or by some per
son in his behalf, and shall specify: First, By whom the person in whose behalf
the writ is applied for is restrained of his liberty, and the place where, naming
all the parties, if they are known, or describing them, if they are not known.
Second, The cause or pretense of the restraint, according to the best of the
knowledge and belief of the applicant. Third, If the restraint be alleged tobe
illegal, in what the illegality consists. 

§ 662. Writs of habeas corpus may be
granted by any court of record in term time, or by a judge of any such court, either
in term or vacation; and upon application the writ shall be granted without
delay. 

§ 663. The writ shall be directed to the
officer or party having the person under restraint, commanding him to have such
person before the court or judge, at such time and, place as the court or judge
shall direct, to do and receive what shall be ordered concerning him, and have
then and there the writ. 

§ 664. If the writ be directed to the sheriff, it shall
be delivered by the clerk to him without delay. 

§ 665. If the writ be directed to-
any other person, it shall be delivered to the sheriff, and shall be by him served

§666. If the person to whom such writ
is directed cannot be found, or shall refuse admittance to the sheriff, the same
may be served by leaving it at the residence of the person to whom it is di
rected, or by affixing the same on some conspicuous place, either of his dwelling
house or where the party is confined or under restraint. 
§ 667. The sheriff or other person to whom
the writ is directed shall make immediate return thereof, and if he neglect or
refuse, after due service, to make return, or shall refuse or neglect to obey the

and verified by the person making it, who shall state: First, The authority or
cause of restraint of the party in his custody. Second, If the authority be in writ
ing, he shall return a copy and produce the original on the hearing. Third, If
he has had the party in his custody or under his restraint, and has transferred him
to another, he shall state to whom, the time, place and cause of the transfer.
He shall produce the party on the hearing, unless prevented by sickness or in
firmity, which must be shown in the return. 
§ 669. The court
or judge, if satisfied of the truth of the allegation of sickness or infirmity, may
proceed to decide on the return, or the hearing may be adjourned until the
party can be produced, or for other good cause. The plaintiff may except to
the sufficiency of, or controvert the return or any part thereof, or allege any
new matter in avoidance; the new matter shall be verified, except in cases of
commitment on a criminal charge; the return and pleadings may be amended
without causing any delay. 
§ 670. The court or judge shall thereupon proceed
in a summary way to hear and determine the cause; and if no legal cause be
shown for the restraint or for the continuance thereof, shall discharge the party.

§ 671. No court or judge shall inquire

ond, upon any process issued on any final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction; or, third, for any contempt of any court, officer or body having

court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, upon an indictment or in
formation.

liable to a civil action for obeying any writ of habeas corpus or order of discharge
made thereon. 

§ 677. Whenever it shall appear by affi
davit that any one is illegally held in custody or restraint, and that there is good
reason to believe that such person will be carried out of the jurisdiction of the
court or judge before whom the application is made, or will suffer some irrepar
able injury before compliance with the writ can be enforced, such court or judge
may cause a warrant to be issued, reciting the facts, and directed to the sheriff
or any constable of the county, commanding him to take the person thus held
in custody or restraint, and forthwith bring him before the court or judge, to be
dealt with according to law. 

§ 678. The court or judge

any proceeding heretofore commenced or judgment rendered or right acquired,
shall not be affected thereby; and where the action of waste is specially men
tioned and authorized in any statute, it may be used until otherwise provided;
but it shall be commenced, and proceeded in throughout, in the manner pre
scribed for the civil action of this code. Wrongs heretofore remediable by ac
tions of waste, are subjects of actions as other wrongs, and the same relief shall
be granted as may now be granted under the action of waste. 

§ 686. When an officer, executor or administrator
within this state, by misconduct or neglect of duty, forfeits his bond or renders
his sureties liable, any person injured thereby, or who is, by law, entitled to the
benefit of the security, may bring an action thereon in his own name, against
the officer, executor or administrator and his sureties, to recover the amount to
which he may be entitled by reason of the delinquency. The action may be in
stituted and proceeded in on a certified copy of the bond, which copy shall be
furnished by the person holding the original thereof. 

§ 687. A judgment in favor of a party for one de
linquency does not preclude the same or another party from an action on the
same security for another delinquency. 

§ 688. The writ of mandamus maybe issued
by the supreme court or the district court, or any justice or judge thereof, during
term, or at chambers, to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person, to
compel the performance of any act which the law specially enjoins as a duty,
resulting from an office, trust or station; but though it may require an inferior
tribunal to exercise its judgment or proceed to the discharge of any of its func
tions, it cannot control judicial discretion. 

§ 689. This writ may not be issued in any
case where there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the
law. It may issue on the information of the party beneficially interested.

§ 690. The writ is either alter
native or peremptory. The alternative writ must state, concisely, the facts,
showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission
to perform it, and command him that immediately upon the receipt of the writ,
or at some other specified time, he do the act required to be performed or show
cause before the court whence the writ issued, at a specified time and place, why
he has not done so; and that he then and there return the writ with his certifi
cate of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a
similar form, except that the words requiring the defendant to show cause why
he has not done as commanded, must be omitted. 

§ 691. When the right to require the per
formance of the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given
for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus may be allowed in the first in
stance; in all other cases, the alternative writ must be first issued. 

§ 692. The motion for the
writ must be made upon affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the ap
plication to be given to the adverse party, or may grant an order to show cause
why it should not be allowed, or may grant the writ without notice. 
§ 693. The allowance of the writ must
be indorsed thereon, signed by the judge of the court granting it, and the writ
must be served personally upon the defendant; if the defendant, duly served,
neglect to return the same, he shall be proceeded against, as for a contempt.
§ 694. On the return day of the alternative writ,
or such further day as the court may allow, the party on whom the writ shall
have been served may show cause, by answer made in the same manner as an
answer to a petition in a civil action. 

§ 695. If no answer be made, a
peremptory mandamus must be allowed against the defendant; if answer be
made, containing new matter, the same shall not, in any respect, conclude the
plaintiff, who may, on the trial or other proceeding, avail himself of any valid
objections to [its] sufficiency, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct de
nial or by way of avoidance. 

§ 696. No other pleading
or written allegation is allowed than the writ and answer; these are the plead
ings in the case, and have the same effect, and are to be construed and may
be amended in the same manner, as pleadings in a civil action; and the issues
thereby joined must be tried, and the further proceedings thereon had, in the
same manner as in a civil action. 

§ 697. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he shall
recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be ascertained by the
court or jury, or by referees, as in a civil action, and costs; and a peremptory
mandamus shall also be granted to him without delay. 

§ 698. A recovery of damages, by virtue of this arti

§ 37. When the plaintiff, his agent or at
torney, shall make oath, in writing, that he has good reason to and does believe
that any person or corporation, to be named, and within the county where the
action is brought, has property of the defendant, (describing the same,) or cred
its in his possession, or is indebted to him, if the officer cannot come at the
property, he shall leave with such garnishee a «opy of the order of attachment,
with a written notice that he appear before the justice, at the return of the
order of attachment and answer, as provided in section thirty-nine: .Provided,
That when the garnishee is a corporation, the answer day for such garnishee
shall in no case be less than ten days from the day of service of the written
notice aforesaid; and if the office or place of business of the president or other
head of the said corporation, or of the secretary, cashier or managing agent
thereof, is not held or kept in the county where the action is pending, the an
swer day for such garnishee shall not be less than twenty days from the day of
service of written notice as aforesaid. 

§ 38. The copy of the order and notice shall be
served upon the garnishee as follows: If he be a person, they shall be served
upon him personally, or left at his usual place of residence; if a corporation,
they shall be left with the president or other head of the same, or the secretary,
cashier or managing agent thereof. 
§ 39. The garnishee shall appear
before the justice, in accordance with the command of the notice, and shall
answer, under oath, all questions put to him touching the property of every de
scription and credits of the defendant, in his possession or under his control;
and he shall disclose truly the amount owing by him to the defendant, whether
due or not; and in the case of a corporation, any stock therein held by or for
the benefit of the defendant, at or after the service of the notice. The exam
ination of the garnishee, with the questions and answers, shall be reduced to
writing by the justice, or in his presence signed by the party and filed, unless
the parties otherwise agree. 

§ 40. A garnishee may pay the money
owing to the defendant by him, to the constable having the order of attachment,
or into court. He shall be discharged from liability to the defendant for any
money so paid, not exceeding the plaintiff's claim. He shall not be subject to
costs beyond those caused by his resistance of the claim against him, and if he
disclose the property in his hands, or the true amount owing by him, and deliver
or pay the same according to the order of the court, he shall be allowed his costs.

§ 41. If the garnishee do not appear
and answer, as required by section thirty-nine, the justice may proceed against
him by attachment, as for a contempt. 
§ 42. If the garnishee
appear and answer, and it is discovered on his examination that at or after the
service of the order of attachment and notice upon him, he was possessed of any
property of the defendant, or was indebted to him, the justice may order the
delivery of such property, and the payment of the amount owing by the gar
nishee into court, or may permit the garnishee to retain the property or the
amount owing, upon the execution of an undertaking to the plaintiff, by one
or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the amount shall be paid or the
property forthcoming, as the court may direct. 

§ 43. If the garnishee
fails to appear and answer, or if he appears and answers, and his disclosure is
not satisfactory to the plaintiff, or if he fails to comply with the order of the
justice to deliver the property and pay the money owing into court, or give
the undertaking required in the preceding section, the plaintiff may proceed
against him in an action, in his own name, as in other cases; and thereupon
such proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment may be rendered
in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the property and credits of every
kind, of the defendant in the possession of the garnishee, and for what shall
appear to be owing by him to the defendant, and for the costs of the proceed
ings against the garnishee. If the plaintiff proceed against the garnishee by
action, for the cause that his disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appears in
the action that such disclosure was incomplete, the plaintiff shall pay the costs
of such action. The judgment in this action may be enforced as judgments in
-other cases. When the claims of the plaintiffs in attachment are satisfied by
the garnishee, he may, on motion, be substituted as the plaintiff .in the judg
ment. 

§ 44. The plaintiff may give notice to the
justice that the answer of the garnishee is unsatisfactory, and demand a trial of
the truth of such answer, and the justice shall thereupon appoint a day for such
trial, which shall be conducted, in all respects, as in other cases. 

§ 45. Final judgment shall not be
rendered against the garnishee until the action against the defendant in attach
ment has been determined; and if, in such action, judgment be rendered for the
defendant in attachment, the garnishee shall be discharged, and recover costs.
If the plaintiff shall recover against the defendant in attachment, and the gar
nishee shall deliver up all property, moneys and credits of the defendant in his
possession, and pay all the moneys from him due, as the court may order, the
garnishee shall be discharged, and the costs of the proceedings against him shall
be paid out of the property and moneys so surrendered, or as the court may
think right and proper. 

§ 46. If judgment be rendered, in the action, for
the defendant, the attachment shall be discharged, and the property attached,
or its proceeds, shall be returned to him. 

§ 47. If judgment be rendered for
the plaintiff, it shall be satisfied as follows: So much of the property remaining
in the hands of the officers, after applying the moneys arising from the sale of
perishable property, and so much of the personal property, if any, as may be
necessary to satisfy the judgment, shall be sold, by order of the justice, und§r
the same restrictions and regulations as if the same had been levied on by exe
cution; and the money arising therefrom, with the amount which may be recov
ered from the garnishee, shall be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs. If
there be not enough to satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand, and execu
tion may issue thereon for the residue, in all respects as in other cases. Any
surplus of the attached property, or its proceeds, shall be returned to the defend
ant. 

§ 48. The justice may order the constable to
repossess himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached property
which may have passed out of his hands without having been sold or converted
into money; and the constable shall, under such order, have the same power to
take the property as he would have under an order of attachment. 
§ 49. Where Beveral attachments are executed on the
same property, or the same persons are made garnishees, the justice issuing the
first order served, on the motion of any of the plaintiffs, may determine the
amounts and priorities of the several attachments, and the proceeds shall be ap
plied accordingly. 
§ 50. The officer shall return, upon every or
der of attachment, what he has done under it. The return must show the prop
erty attached, and the time it was attached. When garnishees are served, their
names, and the time each was served, must be stated. The officer shall also
return, with the order, all undertakings given under it. 
§ 51. An order of attachment binds the prop
erty attached from the time of service, and the garnishee shall stand liable to
the plaintiff in attachment for all property, moneys and credits in his hands, or
due from him to the defendant, from the time he is served with the written no
tice mentioned in section thirty-seven; but when property is attached in the
hands of a consignee or other person having a prior lien, his lien thereon shall
not be affected by the attachment 

§ 52. If the defendant, or other
person in his behalf, at any time before judgment, cause an undertaking to be
executed to the plaintiff, by one or more sureties, resident in the county, to be
approved by the justice, in double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, to be stated
in his affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of
the justice, the attachment in such action shall be discharged, and restitution
made of any property taken under it, or the proceeds thereof. Such undertak
ing shall also discharge the liability of a garnishee, in such action, for any prop
erty of the defendant in his hands. 

§ 53. If the defendant shall, hefore the
trial is commenced, file an affidavit, denying the grounds laid for the attach
ment in the plaintiff's affidavit, the justice shall, on reasonable notice, in writ
ing, being given to the opposite party, proceed to examine into the truth of the
grounds laid for such attachment, and shall hear such evidence as may be pro
duced by either party; and if it appear that such grounds are not sustained by
the evidence, the justice shall discharge the attachment. 

§ 54. If, in any
case where an order of attachment has been issued by a justice of the peace,
it shall appear from the return of the officer and from the examination of the gar
nishee, that no property, moneys, rights, credits or effects of the defendant has
been taken under the attachment, but that the defendant is the owner of an in
terest in real estate in the county, the justice before whom such action is pend
ing shall, at the request of the plaintiff, forthwith certify his proceedings to the
district court of the proper county; and thereupon the clerk of said court shall
docket said cause, and the action shall be proceeded with in said court in all
respects as if the same had originated therein. 

§ 54a. That in
all personal actions arising upon contract before justices of the peace if the
plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall file with the justice, at the time of or after the
commencement of suit, an affidavit stating that he has good reason to believe,
and does believe, that any person or corporation to be named, and within the
county where the action is brought, has property, money, goods, chattels, credits
and effects in his hands, or under his contract, belonging to the defendant, or
that such person or corporation is anywise indebted to the principal defend
ant, whether such indebtedness be due or not, that the principal defendant (nam
ing him) is justly indebted to the plaintiff in a given amount over and above all
legal setoff, and that the plaintiff has good reason to and does believe that he
will lose the same unless a garnishee summons issue to the aforesaid person, a
garnishee summons shall be issued and personally served, in the same manner
as an ordinary summons, and from the time of such service the garnishee shall
Btand liable to the plaintiff for all property, money and articles in his hands or
due from him to the defendant. 

§ 54i. Said garnishee summons shall be
directed to the proper officer, reciting the commencement of suit against the
principal defendant and the filing of the affidavit, and thereupon commanding
said officer to warn and summons such person to appear before said justice, on
a day named, not more than twenty days from the date of issuing the same, to
make disclosure, under his oath, to be filed with the said justice, touching his li
ability as garnishee of the principal defendant (naming him) as charged in said
affidavit, and thenceforth to pay no money and deliver no property to the de
fendant (naming him), and of said writ to make due return. 
§ 54c. The garnishee shall appear before the jus
tice in accordance with the commands of said summons, and the same proceed
ings shall thereafter be had in case of the appearance or default of said garnishee,
as near as may be, and with like effect as in proceedings against a garnishee in
attachment before justices of the peace. 
§ 5id. That when under proceed
ings to which this act is supplemental, it shall appear to the justice from the
answers of the garnishee that he has property, moneys, credits, chattels or ef
fects in his hands, or under his control, belonging to the defendant, or that the
garnishee is anywise indebted to the defendant, and that the summons issued in
the action has not been and cannot be served on the defendant in the county in
the manner prescribed by law, the justice shall continue the cause for a period
of not less than thirty nor more than fifty days, and thereupon service may be
made by publication in the same manner and with like effect as is prescribed
by law in proceedings in attachment before justices of the peace. 

§ 55. Justices of the peace shall
have jurisdiction of actions for the recovery of specific personal property not ex
ceeding one hundred dollars in value, as herein provided. 

§ 56. An action for this purpose shall not
be brought until there is filed in the office of the justice an affidavit of the plaint
iff, his agent or attorney, showing:
First, A description of the property claimed.
Second, That the plaintiff is the owner thereof, or has a special ownership
therein, stating the facts in relation thereto, and that he is entitled to the imme
diate possession of the property.
Third, That the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant
Fourth, That it was not taken in execution on any order or judgment against
said plaintiff, or if so taken on execution, that it is by statute exempt from seiz
ure, or for the payment of any tax, fine or amercement assessed against him, or
by virtue of an order of delivery issued under this article, or any other mesne or
final process issued against said plaintiff; and,
Fifth, The actual value of the property. When several articles are claimed,
the value of each article shall be stated as nearly as practicable. 

§ 57. The justice shall not issue a summons as
hereinafter provided, until there has been executed in his office, by one or more
sufficient sureties of the plaintiff, to be approved by the justice, an undertaking
in not less than double the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit, to
the effect that the plaintiff shall duly prosecute the action, and pay all costs and
damages which may be awarded against him, and if the property be delivered
to him that he will return the same to the defendant, if a return thereof be ad
judged. 

§ 58. Upon such affidavit and undertaking being ex
ecuted and filed with the justice, he shall issue a summons as in other cases, but
in addition commanding the constable immediately to seize and take into his
custody, wherever they may be found in the county, the goods and chattels men
tioned in the affidavit, and deliver the same to the plaintiff. 

§ 59. The constable shall execute the writ by
taking the property therein mentioned. He shall also deliver a copy of the
summons to the persons charged with the unlawful detention of property, or
leave such a copy at his usual place of residence, and shall make return of the
time and manner of service, and any undertaking taken by him. 
§ 60. If, within twentyfour
hours after service or the copy of the summons, there is executed, by one
or more sufficient sureties of the defendant, to be approved by the constable, an
undertaking to the plaintiff, in not less than double the amount of the value of
the property, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff, to the effect that the de
fendant will deliver the property to the plaintiff if such delivery be adjudged,
and will pay all costs and damages that may be awarded against him, the con
stable shall return the property to the defendant. If such undertaking be not
given within twenty-four hours after the service of the order, the constable shall
deliver the property to the plaintiff. 

§ 61. The plaintiff may, within twentyfour
hours from the time the undertaking mentioned in the preceding section
is given by the defendant, give notice to the constable that he excepts to the
sufficiency of the sureties. If he fails to do so, he must be deemed to have
waived all objections to them. When the plaintiff excepts, the sureties must
justify, upon notice, as bail on arrest. The constable shall be responsible for
the sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is waived, as above
provided, or until they justify. 
§ 62. The affidavit of the plaintiff,
as to the value of the property, shall fix the jurisdiction of the justice so far as
such value is concerned; but the value of the property shall not be assessed
against the defendant at a greater amount than that sworn to by the plaintiff in
his affidavit 

§ 63. If the property has been delivered
to the plaintiff, and he fails to prosecute his action to final judgment, the justice
shall, upon the application of the defendant or his attorney, impanel a jury to
inquire into the right of property, and the right of possession of the defendant
to the property taken. If the jury shall be satisfied that the said property was
the property of the defendant at the commencement of the action, or if the said
jury be satisfied that the defendant was entitled to the possession at such time,
they shall find accordingly, and shall further find the value of such property, or
the value of the possession thereof, and any damages for withholding the same
as may be just and proper. 
§ 64. In all cases when the property has been deliv
ered to the plaintiff, when the jury shall find for the defendant, they shall also
find whether the defendant had the right of property, or the right of possession
only, at the commencement of the suit, and, if they find either in his favor, they
shall also find the value of the property, or the value of the possession, and such
damages for withholding said property as may be just and proper. 

§ 65. The judgment in the cases mentioned in the
two preceding sections shall be for the return of the property, or for the value
thereof, or the value of the possession of the same, in case a return cannot be
had, and for damages for withholding said property, and the costs of suit.

§ 66. In all cases when the property has
been delivered to the plaintiff, where the jury shall find for the plaintiff on the
trial, or on inquiry of damages, they shall assess adequate damages to the plaint
iff for the illegal detention of the property, for which, with costs of suit, the
justice shall render judgment against the defendant. 
§ 67. When the property claimed has not been
taken, the action may proceed as one for damages only, and the plaintiff shall
be entitled to such damages as may be right and proper. 

§ 68. The constable, in executing the
writ, may break open any building or inclosure in which the property claimed,
or any part thereof, is concealed; but not until he has been refused an entrance
into said building or inclosure, and the delivery of the property, after having
demanded the same. 
§ 69. Whenever it shall be made to ap
pear to the satisfaction of the justice, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or other
wise, that the defendant, or any other person, knowingly conceals the property
sought to be recovered, or, having control thereof, refuses to deliver the same
to the officer, the justice may commit such defendant, or other person, until he
or they disclose where such property is, or deliver the same to the officer. 
§ 70. If any justice shall issue
a writ to replevin property, as is provided by this act, without the affidavit and
undertaking being executed and filed in his office, as is provided in this article,
the same shall be set aside at his costs, and he shall be liable, in damages, to
the party injured. 

§ 71. In all cases before a justice, the
plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall file with such justice a bill of particulars of
bis demand, and the defendant, if required by the plaintiff, his agent or attor
ey, shall file a like bill of particulars he may claim as a setoff; and the evi
dence on the trial shall be confined to the items set forth in said bill. 

§ 72. The bill of particulars
must state, in a plain and direct manner, the facts constituting the cause of ac
tion or the claim to be set off. 

§ 73. The bill of particulars of the plaintiff
must be filed at the time the action is commenced, and that of the defendant must
be filed at or before the hour named in the summons for the appearance of the
defendant, unless further time be given' by the justice, for good cause shown.
§ 74. The
bill of particulars may be amended at any time before the trial, or during the
trial, or upon appeal, to supply any deficiency or omission in the items, when,
by such amendment, substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment
be made at the time of or during the trial, and it be made to appear to the sat
isfaction of the justice, by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse
party, in consequence of such amendment, an adjournment must be granted.
The justice may also, in his discretion, require, as a condition of an amendment,
the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the justice; but such
payment cannot be required unless an adjournment is made necessary by the
amendment. 

§ 75. If, on the return of process, or at any time be
fore trial shall have been commenced, either party shall file with the justice of
the peace before whom any cause is instituted or is pending for trial, an affi
davit, stating: First, That such justice is a material witness for either party;
or, second, that he verily believes that he cannot have a fair and impartial trial
before such justice, on account of the bias or prejudice of the said justice against
the affiant; or, third, if a jury be demanded by the adverse party, then that
lie cannot, as he verily believes, have a fair and impartial trial in such town
ship, on account of the bias or prejudice of the citizens thereof, the trial of the
case shall be changed to some other justice of the peace, as provided in the
next section. 
§ 76. If the place of the trial be
changed on account of the bias or prejudice of the justice, or of his being a
material witness in the cause, such cause shall be transferred for trial before
some other justice of the peace of the same township, if there be one there le
gally competent to try such cause; if there be no such justice within such town
ship, or if such change be granted on account of the bias of prejudice of the
citizens of such township against such party, the case shall be taken to some
justice in an adjoining township of the same county. 

§ 77. The justice granting such
change shall deliver or transmit the papers in the cause, together with a certi
fied transcript of the proceedings before him, to the justice to whom such change
may be granted, who shall proceed therein, and have the same jurisdiction, pow
ers and duties, in all respects whatever, as if such suit had been originally insti
tuted before him. 
§ 78. Before any such change shall be allowed, the costs,
as specified in the next following section, shall be paid by the party applying
for such change, or he shall have confessed a judgment therefor before the jus
tice granting the change. 
§ 79. When such change is at the instance
of the plaintiff, he shall be taxed with all the costs which have accrued, and
which shall accrue in the cause, until such transcript and papers shall be deliv
ered to the justice to whom such cause is removed for trial; and when on the
application of the defendant, he shall be taxed with the costs which have accrued
for issuing subpoenas to witnesses, and service thereof, witness fees, and costs of
the justice for transferring the cause to the docket of the other justice. 

§ 80. Upon the return day, if a jury be required,
or if the justice be actually engaged in other official business, he may adjourn
the trial without the consent of either party, as follows: First, Where a
party is in attendance who is not a resident of the county, or where the defend
ant is in attendance, under arrest, the adjournment not to exceed forty-eight
hours, and the defendant, if under arrest, to continue in custody. Second, In
other cases, not to exceed eight days, unless by consent of parties. If the trial
be not adjourned, it must take place at the time stated in the summons. 

§ 81. Either party may have the trial adjourned
without the consent of the other, for a period not exceeding fifteen days, by filing
an affidavit of himself, his agent or attorney, that he cannot, for want of ma
terial testimony which he has been unable to procure, safely proceed to trial.
§ 82. An adjournment may be had on ac
count of the absence of evidence by either party on the return day, or any other
subsequent time to which the case may be adjourned, on the application of either
party, for a period not exceeding ninety days from the time of the return day
of the summons, upon filing an affidavit showing the materiality of the evidence
expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has been used to obtain it, and
where the evidence may be; and if it is for an absent witness, the affidavit must
show where the witness resides, if his residence is known to the party, and the
probability of procuring his testimony within a reasonable time, and what facts
he believes the witness will prove, and that he believes them to be true. If
thereupon the adverse party will consent that on the trial the statement of facts
alleged in the affidavit shall be read and treated as the deposition of the absent
witness, or that the facts in relation to other evidence shall be taken as proved
to the extent as alleged in the affidavit, no continuance shall be granted on the
ground of the absence of such evidence. 

§ 83. If either party fail to appear
at the time specified in the summons, or within one hour thereafter, or fail to
attend at the time to which the trial has been adjourned, or fail to file the
necessary bill of particulars, the cause may proceed at the request of the ad
verse party; and in all cases where a counterclaim or setoff has been filed be
fore the dismissal of the cause by the plaintiff, the defendant shall have the
right to proceed with the trial of his claim. 
§ 84. In all actions, al
legations of the execution of written instruments and indorsements thereon, of
the existence of a corporation or partnership, or any appointment or authority,
or the correctness of an account duly verified by the affidavit or affirmation of
the party, his agent or attorney, shall be taken as true unless the denial of the
same be verified by the affidavit of the opposite party, his agent or attorney.
§ 85. Any justice may issue subpoenas to compel the
attendance of witnesses to give evidence on any trial pending before himself,
or for the purpose of taking depositions, or to perpetuate testimony. 
§ 86. Subpoenas may be served by a constable or
any other person, and shall be served by reading the same or stating the con
tents thereof to the witness, or by leaving a copy thereof at his usual place of
residence. 
§ 87. When not served by a constable or some person
deputed for that purpose by a justice, no fees shall be charged in the suit for
serving it. 
§ 88. If any witness, having
been subpoenaed, attend, and be not examined by either party, the costs of such
witness shall be paid by the party ordering the subpoena, unless the adverse
party, by confessing the matter or otherwise, render unnecessary the examina
tion of such witness. 
§ 89. Whenever it shall appear to the
satisfaction of a justice, by proof made before him, that any person has been
duly served with a subpoena to appear and give testimony before him in any
matter in which he has authority to require such witness to appear and testify,
that his testimony is material, and that he refuses or neglects to attend as such
witness, in conformity with such subpoena, the justice shall issue a warrant to
arrest the delinquent, for the purpose of compelling his attendance and punish
ing his disobedience. 
§ 90. When the person arrested is brought before the
justice, or when a person in attendance refuses to testify as a witness, and no
valid excuse be shown, the justice may impose a fine on him not exceeding five
dollars. An entry of such fine, stating the reason thereof, must be made by
the justice in his docket; and thereupon shall have the effect of a judgment in
favor of the state of Kansas against the delinquent, and may be enforced against
his person or property. 
§ 91. Every person subpoenaed as afore
said, and neglecting to appear or refusing to testify, shall also be liable to the
party in whose behalf he shall have been subpoenaed, for all damages which
such party shall sustain by reason of such delinquency. 
§ 92. Depositions may be taken to be read in any
cause pending before a justice of the peace, in like manner, and subject to the
same rules and restrictions and rules of law, as in cases pending in courts of
record. 
§ 93. At the time appointed for trial, if no jury shall
have been demanded by either party, the justice shall proceed to try the action,
shall hear the proofs and determine the cause, according to law and the right.

§ 94. Where parties agree to enter, without
process, before a justice, an action, of which such justice has cognizance, the
justice shall enter the same on his docket and proceed to trial, judgment and
execution, in all respects in the same manner as if summons had been issued,
served and returned. 
§ 95. In all civil actions, after an appear
ance of the defendant, and before the justice shall proceed to inquire into the
merits of the cause, either party may demand a jury to try the action, which
jury shall be composed of six good and lawful men, having the qualifications of
jurors in the district court, unless the parties shall agree on a less number. 
§ 96. When a jury is demanded, the trial of the
case must be adjourned until a time fixed for the return of the jury; if neither
party desire an adjournment, the time must be determined by the justice, and
must be on the same day or within the next two days. The jury must be im
mediately selected as herein provided. 
§ 97. The justice shall write in a panel
the names of eighteen persons, citizens of the county, from which the defend
ant, his. agent or attorney, must strike one name, the plaintiff, his agent or at
torney, one, and so on alternately, until each shall have stricken six names,
and the remaining six shall constitute the jury to try such case; and if either
party neglect or refuse to aid in striking the jury as aforesaid, the justice shall
strike the same in behalf of such party. 
§ 98. The justice thereupon shall issue a sum
mons for the jury, in which the following form shall be observed, in substance,
as near as practicable: "The state of Kansas, county. The state of
Kansas to , constable of township: You are hereby com

persons summoned, at the time appointed for the trial of the cause. 
§ 100. Jurors, for neglecting or re
fusing to attend when properly summoned, or refusing to serve when in at
tendance, shall be liable to a like penalty, and be proceeded against in the same
manner, as witnesses who fail to attend or refuse to testify. 
§ 101. The constable shall be in at
tendance on the court, at and during the progress of the trial; and if, from
challenge or other cause, the panel shall not be full, he may fill the same in

the cause shall be continued, the jurors must attend at the time and place ap

shall sit together and hear the proofs and allegations of the parties, and, after
hearing the same, shall be kept together in some convenient place, under the

fied that a jury, sworn in any cause before him, cannot agree on their verdict,
after having consulted upon it a reasonable time, he may discharge them and
continue the cause, and may, if required by either party, proceed to strike
another jury as hereinbefore provided. The cause shall be continued until
such time as the justice thinks reasonable, unless the parties or their attorneys
agree on a longer or shorter time, or unless they agree that the justice may
render judgment on the evidence already heard before him. 
§ 110. The justice before whom a cause has been
tried, on motion of the party aggrieved, at any time within five days after the
decision or verdict, shall vacate- the decision or verdict and grant a new trial,
for the same reasons and upon the same terms and conditions as provided in
the code of civil procedure in like causes; and he shall set a time for a new
trial, of which the opposite party shall have at least three days' notice. 

§ 111. The opposite party shall also have a reasonable
notice of such motion for a new trial, if the same is not made on the day of the

the proceedings shall be, in all respects, as upon the return of the summons.
§ 112. In all cases which shall be tried by
a jury before a justice of the peace, either party shall have the right to except
to the opinion of the justice upon any question of law arising during the trial
of the cause; and when either party shall allege such exception, it shall be the
duty of the justice to allow and sign a bill containing such exception, if truly
alleged, with the point decided, so that the same may be made part of the
record of the cause. 

§ 112a. Bills of exception
may be made, signed and sealed in any case tried before a justice of the peace,

county, and if he be not a resident of the county, by leaving a written notice
thereof at the office of the justice, ten days before the trial. 

§ 115. Upon a verdict, the justice
must immediately render judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the jus
tice, judgment must be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if the
defendant has been arrested, or his property attached; in other cases, it must
be entered either at the close of the trial, or, if the justice then desires further
time to consider, on or by the fourth day thereafter, both days inclusive. 

§ 116. When the amount due
to either party exceeds the sum for which the justice is authorized to enter judg
ment, such party may remit the excess, and judgment, may be entered for the
residue. A defendant need not remit such excess, and may withhold setting the
same off; and a recovery for the amount set off and allowed, or any part thereof,
shall not be a bar to his subsequent action for the amount withheld. 

§ 117. If the defendant,
any time before trial, offers, in writing, to allow judgment to be taken against
him for a specified sum, the plaintiff may immediately have judgment therefor,
with the costs then accrued; but if he do not accept such offer before the trial,
and fails to recover, in the action, a sum equal to the offer, he cannot recover
costs accrued after the offer, but costs must be adjudged against him; but the
offer, and failure to accept it, cannot be given in evidence or mentioned on the
trial. 

§ 118. When judgment

Second, If it be a case where any of the judgment debtors are certified on the
docket as surety, it shall command that the money be made of the personal prop
erty of the principal debtor, and. for want thereof, of the personal property of
the surety. In such case, the personal property of the principal, subject to ex

expiration of the thirty days. 
§ 142. It shall be lawful for the sheriff or

of the peace who issued the execution, or for the constable holding the execu
tion, to purchase, either directly or indirectly, any property sold on such execu
tion; and any justice or constable who shall offend against the provisions of

ders, or other just cause, it shall be his duty to return with the execution a
schedule of all such goods and chattels; and the justice shall, unless otherwise
directed by the party for Whom such execution issued, or his agent, immediately
thereafter issue an order, thereby commanding any constable to whom the
same may be directed or delivered, to expose such property to sale; which sale
and the proceeding thereon shall be the same as if such property had been sold
on the original execution. 
§ 151. Any constable having levied on goods and
chattels, of which he permits the party against whom the execution issued to re
tain the possession, is hereby authorized to take such security for his own indem
nity as he may require, that such property shall be delivered at the time and
place appointed for the sale thereof. 

§ 152. If the constable, by virtue of any at

pointed for the sale of such property. 

§ 152J. If, on the trial, the justice shall be satis
fied, from the proof, that the property, or any part thereof, belongs to the claim
ant or claimants, such justice shall render judgment against the party in whose
favor such execution or attachment issued for the costs, and issue execution
therefor, and shall, moreover, give a written order to the constable, who levied
on, or who may be charged with the duty of selling such property, directing him
to restore the same, or so much thereof as may have been found to belong to
such claimant or claimants: Provided, That either party may at, or before the
time of trial call for a jury, and in that case, the mode of drawing, and all pro
ceedings there, shall be conducted in all respects as is now provided for trial by
jury, before justices of the peace.

and shall make return to the justice who issued the same to that effect, such

in his possession or under his control, and the amount owing by him to the judg
ment debtor, whether due or not 

§ 156. Such order shall be issued in the
