the performance of which such bond ought to have been
taken.

returnable, put in his answer, without oath, denying the

shall be had at the same term, and on such trial the plaintiff
shall be held to prove the existence of the facts set forth in

costs of the plaintiff.

may, upon motion, compel him to answer by attachment of his

body.

§ 2709. Such judgment by default may be proceeded on
to final judgment in like manner, as in cases of the defendant
in actions upon contracts, but no final judgment shall be rendered against the garnishee until there shall be final jut gment against the defendant.

§ 2710. The plaintiff may deny the answer of the garnishee in whole or in part, and the issue shall be tried as ordinary issues between plaintiffs. If on such trial the property or effects of the defendant be found in the hands of the
garnishee, the value thereof shall be assessed and judgment

answer of the garnishee be not excepted to or denied at the
same term at which it is filed, it shall be taken to be true and
suhicient.

member of such body or board: such ‘fine, when collected, shall
