1853 Proposed Civil Procedure Code for Utah Territory

"The every day increasing necessity for a law regulating procedure in civil cases induced them to devote the earliest and greatest portion of their labor to that important subject. It has been thought prudent to defer for the present the preparation of an index.
Your committee regret that the want of sufficient time and unavailable pressure of other business have prevented them from reporting upon the subjects of a Chancery and a Criminal practice as well as a revision of the criminal law and many other subjects which the public interest demands."

§ 70. The summons shall require the defendant to appear and answer the complaint, or that judgment by default will be taken against him:
1. If he be served within the county in which the action is brought, ten days before the term of the court; or if in any other county, thirty days before the court he shall appear and answer the complaint on the return day of the summons.
2. If he be served less than ten days within the county in which the action is brought or less than thirty days in any other county, he shall appear and answer the complaint on the first day of the term next after the return day of the summons. 

§ 71. The summons shall be served by the sheriff of the county in which the court is held, or by his deputy, or by a person specially appointed. The summons shall be returned to the office of the clerk from which it issued, with the certificate of the sheriff or his deputy or the affidavit of the person appointed of its service and of the service of a copy of the complaint.

§ 73. When the service of the summons cannot be made as prescribed in the last preceding section, and the defendant, after due diligence cannot be found within the territory, and when that fact appears by affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, or judge thereof, and it in like manner appears that a cause of action exists against the defendant or that he is a proper party to an action relating to real property in this territory, such court or judge may grant an order that the service be made by publication of a summons in either of the following cases:

When publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint, out of the territory, shall be equivalent to publication and deposit in the post office. In either case, the service of the summons shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time prescribed in the order for publication.

4. The written admission of the defendant.
In case of service otherwise than by publication, the certificate, affidavit, or admission must state the time and place of service.

§ 79. From the time of the service of the summons and complaint, the court shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance of the defendant shall be equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

Chapter 12. General rules of pleading.

§ 95. Every pleading except a demurrer shall be subscribed and verified under oath by the party or his attorney.

§ 97. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading a copy of the instruments of writing, or the items of an account therein alleged; but, he shall file a verified copy thereof with such pleading, and serve the same on the adverse party. He shall within ten days after a demand thereof in writing, deliver the adverse party a copy of such instrument of writing, or the items of an account, verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true; or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, or judge thereof may order a further account, when the one delivered is defective and the court may, in all cases, order a bill of particulars of the claim of either party to be furnished. 

§ 98. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view of substantial justice between the parties. 

§ 99. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of any person aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations of pleading are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge or defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment. 

§ 100. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.

§ 101. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance, but it may be stated generally, that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. 

§ 102. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the date of its approval, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

§ 103. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published, or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish on trial that it was so published or spoken.

§ 104. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his answer allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances to reduce the amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

§ 105. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained doing damage, an answer that the defendant or person by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing damage thereon, shall be good without setting forth the title tot such real property. 

§ 106. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the same complaint, when they all arise out of:
1. Contract, express or implied; or
2. Injuries, with or without force, to the person; or
3. Injuries, with or without force, to property; or
4. Injuries to character; or
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same.
6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages for the withholding thereof; or
7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation of laws.
But the causes of action so united must all belong to one only of these classes and must effect all the parties to the action and not require different places of trial and must be separately stated. 

§ 107. Every material allegation of the complaint, not specifically controverted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter in the answer, not specifically controverted by the reply, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter in a reply shall not, in any respect, conclude the defendant, who may, on the trial, countervail it by proofs, either in direct denial, or by way of avoidance.

§ 108. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim or defense and which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient.

Chapter 13. Amendments.

§ 109. Any pleading may be once amended by the party, of course, without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings already had at any time before the case is called for trial. In such case a copy of the amended pleading shall be served on the adverse party. 

§ 110. After the decision upon a demurrer if it be overruled, the party shall be allowed to plead over at such time as the court may direct. If the demurrer be sustained, either party may amend any pleading demurred to, upon such terms as may be just, and he shall serve a copy of the same, as amended, on the adverse party, within such time as may be prescribed by the court.

§ 111. The court may in its discretion and upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made after the time limited therefore, or by an order enlarge such time.

§ 112. When a plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name; and when his name shall be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

§ 113. The plaintiff and defendant respectively before joining issue, may be allowed on motion to make a supplemental complaint, answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint, answer, or reply. 

Chapter 14. Of issues.

§ 114. Issues arise upon pleadings when a fact or conclusion of law is maintained by the one party and controverted by the other. They are of two kinds:
1. Of law;
2. Of fact.

§ 115. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the complaint, answer, or reply, or to some part thereof. 

§ 116. An issue of fact arises:
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint controverted by the answer; or
2. Upon new matter, or a set-off controverted by the reply; or
3. Upon new matter in the reply.

§ 117. Issues, both of law and of fact, may arise upon different parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases the issues of law shall be first tried. 

§ 118. An issue of law shall be tried by the court. An issue of fact shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived.

§ 119. A motion to postpone a trial on the ground of the absence of evidence, except by the consent of the parties, shall only be made upon affidavit showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be obtained, and what diligence has been used to procure it, and also the name and residence of the witness or witnesses. The court may also require the moving party to state, upon affidavit, the evidence which he expects to obtain, and if the adverse party thereupon admit that such evidence would be given, and that it be considered as actually given on the trial, or offered and overruled as improper, the trial shall not be postponed. 

Chapter 15. Trial by jury.

§ 120. When the action is called for trial, the clerk shall prepare separate ballots, containing the names of the jurors summoned, who have appeared and not been excused, and deposit them in a box. He shall then draw from the box twelve names, and the persons whose names are drawn shall constitute the jury. If the ballots become exhausted before the jury is complete, or if from any cause a juror or jurors be excused or discharged, the sheriff under the direction of the court, shall summon from the bystanders or citizens of the county or district so many qualified persons as may be necessary to complete the jury. The jury shall consist of twelve persons, unless the parties consent to a less number. The parties may consent to any number not less than three, and such consent shall be entered by the clerk on the minutes of the trial.

§ 121. Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are several parties on either side, they shall join in a challenge before it can be made. The challenge shall be to individual jurors, and shall be preemptory or for cause. Each party shall be entitled to four preemptory challenges. 

§ 122. Challenge for cause may be taken on one or more of the following grounds:
1. A want of any of the qualifications provided by statute to render a person competent as a juror;
2. Standing in relation of guardian and ward, employer and clerk, or principal and agent to either party; or being a member of the family of either party; or a partner in business with either party; or being security on any undertaking or obligation for either party;
4. Having served as a juror, or been a witness, on a previous trial between the same parties for the same cause of action;
5. Interest on the part of the juror in the event of the action;
6. Having formed or expressed an unqualified opinion or belief as to the merits of the action.
7. The existence of a state of mind in the juror, evincing enmity to either party.

§ 123. Challenges for cause shall be tried by the court. The juror challenged and any other person as a witness may be examined on the trial of the challenge. 

§ 124. As soon as the jury is completed, an oath or affirmation shall be administered to the jurors in substance, that they, each of them, will well and truly try the matter in issue between the plaintiff and the defendant, and a true verdict give according to the evidence.

§ 125. When the jury is completed and sworn, the ballots containing the names of the jurors sworn, shall be laid aside till the jury so sworn is discharged, and then they shall be returned to the box; and every ballot drawn containing the name of a juror not to sworn, shall be returned to the box as soon as the jury is completed.

§ 126. The jurors may be kept together in charge of a proper officer, or may in the discretion of the court, at any time before the submission of a cause to the jury, be permitted to separate, in either case they may be admonished by the court that they shall not converse with any other person, or among themselves, on any subject connected with the trial, or to express any opinion thereon, until the case is finally submitted to them.

§ 127. If after the impaneling of the jury, and before a verdict, a juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duties, the court may order him to be discharged. In that case, unless the parties agree to proceed with the other jurors, a new juror may be sworn, and the trial begin anew; or the jury may be discharged and a new jury then or afterwards impaneled. 

§ 128. After hearing the charge of the court, which shall be delivered in writing, the jury may either decide in the court room, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they shall be kept together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient place under the charge of one or more officers, until they agree upon their verdict, or are discharged. The officer shall, to the utmost of his ability, keep the jury together, separate from other persons; he shall not suffer any communication to be made to them, or make any himself, unless by order of the court, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict; and he shall not, before the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person, the state of their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon. 

§ 129. Upon retiring for deliberation, the jury may take with them the pleadings in the cause, and all papers (except depositions) which have been received as evidence on the trial, or copies of such parts of public records, or private documents given in evidence, as ought not in the opinion of the court, be taken from the person having them in possession. They may also take with them notes of the testimony or other proceedings on the trial, taken by themselves or any of them; but none taken by any other person, except by consent of the parties. 

§ 130. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a disagreement between them, as to any part of the testimony, or if they desire to be informed of any point of law arising in the cause, they may require the officer to conduct them into court. Upon their being brought into court, the information required shall be given in the presence of, or after notice to the parties or counsel. 

Chapter 16. Of the verdict. 

§ 131. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. A general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the court. 

§ 132. In an action for the recovery of personal property, if the property has not been delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant, by his answer, claim a return thereof, the jury shall assess the value of the property, if there verdict be in favor of the plaintiff, or if they find in favor of the defendant, and that he is entitled to a return thereof, and may at the same time assess the damages, if any are claimed in the complaint or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained, by reason of the detention or taking and withholding such property.

§ 133. In every action for the recovery of money only, or real property, the jury in their discretion may render a general or special verdict. In all other cases, the court may direct the jury to find a special verdict in writing upon all or any of the issues; and in all cases may instruct them, if they render a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be state in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The special verdict or finding, shall be filed with the clerk and entered upon the minutes.

§ 134. When a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent with the general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.

Territory of Utah

To C.D.
You are hereby notified that A.B. has sued out a writ of error from the supreme court, to reverse the judgment of the district court of said district, given in your favor, against the said A.B. at the __ term of 18--; and unless you appear in the said supreme court on the __ Monday of 18--, the cause will be heard in your absence.

If returned "not found," the court of error may make such order for the service or publication of the notice, as shall appear most likely in the particular case, to convey a knowledge of the proceeding to the defendant in error, and may then proceed as if the notice had been personally served.

§ 263. The transcript shall contain a copy of the writ and return, the pleadings, the journal entries and bills of exceptions, the execution and return, and such other matters as the court or judge shall have ordered to be made as part of the record.

§ 267. The undertaking for a writ of error may be in the following form:
We promise to pay all costs that may be awarded against A.B. on his writ of error in this cause, and also the judgment if affirmed, or any modified judgment that may be given against him.

§ 270. The reversal of a judgment, order, or decision, shall not affect the title of property sold upon an execution issued upon such judgment, order or decision, if such property be purchased as the sale by a stranger, but if purchased by the judgment creditor, the plaintiff in error may bring an action for the recovery thereof, and the court may award restitution or render such other judgment as justice may require.

4. It must have existed at the time of the commencement of the action, and must then have belonged to the defendant;
5. It shall be allowed only in actions founded upon demands which could themselves be the subject of set-off, according to law;
6. If there be several defendants, the demand set-off must be due to all of them jointly;
7. It must be a demand existing against the plaintiff in the action, unless the action be brought in the name of a plaintiff who has no real interest in the contract, upon which the action is founded; in which case no set-off of a demand against the plaintiff shall be allowed, unless as hereinafter specified.

§ 273.
