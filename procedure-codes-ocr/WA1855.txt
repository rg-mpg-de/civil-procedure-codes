and whether he prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the
mitigating circumstances. '

SEC. 63. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained,
doing damage, an answer that the defendant, or person by whose command
he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing
the damage thereon, shall be good, without setting forth the title to such
real property.

SEC. 64. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the same

2d. Injuries, with or without force, to the person; or

claim or defence, and which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insuiiicient.

proof shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse
party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits.

shall be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has
been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended,
upon such terms as shall be just.

SEC. 67. When the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence,
or may order an immediate amendment, without costs. ,

SEC. 68. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defense, to which the proof is directed, is not proved, not in some particular
or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not be
deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure of
proof.

deemed reasonable, and at any time before the close of the next term of
the court, after the term in which any judgment, order, or other proceeding is had, the court, on motion, and upon good cause shown, after reasonable notice to the adverse party, or his attorney, may relieve a party from
such judgment, order, proceeding, taken against him, through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and supply an omission in any
proceedings.

SEC. 70. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of the defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding
by any name; and when his true name shall be discovered, the pleading or
proceeding may be amended accordingly.

SEC. 71. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings, which shall not effect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed or
effected by reason of such error or defect. ' ,

SEC. 72. The court may, on motion, allow supplemental pleadings,
showing facts which occurred after the former pleadings were filed.
