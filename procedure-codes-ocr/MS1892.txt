32 (2309). Appeal from final judgment or decree.—An appeal may be taken
to the supreme court from any final judgment of a circuit court in a civil case, not
being a judgment by confession, or from any final decree of a chancery court, not

but such appeal shall operate as a supersedeas only when the party applying for the
same shall comply with the terms hereinafter prescribed; and in no case shall such
appeal be held to vacate the judgment or decree.
An appeal may be prosecuted from a judgment or decree final in its nature, immediately after its ren
dition and before the end of the term of the court at which it is rendered. Byrne v. Jeffries, 38 Miss., 533.
Where an appeal is prosecuted from the decision of the board ot supervisors to the circuit court, and
there decided, the party aggrieved may appeal to the supreme court; the statute is "from any final judg
ment," etc. Crump v. Colfax Co., 52 Miss., 107.
An order of a circuit court of the state sustaining a motion for the removal of the cause to the federal
court, is not a final judgment from which an appeal can be prosecuted. Jackson v. Alabama R. R. Co., 58Miss., 648.
An appeal may be prosecuted from a final judgment of the circuit court, rendered in vacation under a
statute authorizing the case to be so heard and determined. Perkins v. Carravvay, 59 Miss., 222.

cided in vacation within thirty days after the decree is tiled in the proper office.
Such appeal must be allowed by the court or the chancellor ; hut the appeal bond

The defendant who appeal* from a decree overrulinsr his demurrer to the bill, is not bound to answer be
fore decision* on the appeal. Montgomery v. Norris, 1 How. (Mies.), 499.
The appeal from decree overruling a demurrer to the bill is a mutter of right. Nesbit v. Rodewald, 43
Miss. 304; McKee v. Coffee, 58 Miss., 653.
The clerk of the court has no power to allow appeals under this section. Nesbit v. Hodewald, 43 Miss.,
304; Thompson v. Toomer, 50 Miss., 394; Johnson v. Jones, 51 Miss., 800.
Where the decree on the demurrer to a bill is that it be sustained as to one ground assigned and over

expense and delay; but such appeal shall be applied for within ten days after the
date of the order or decree complained of; and bond shall be given and approved
as in appeals from a decree overruling a demurrer, and the chancellor shall determine
whether the appeal shall operate as a supersedeas or not.
The clerk of the chancery court has no authority to grant an appeal from interlocutory orders or decrees.
Holliman v. Dibbrell, 51 Miss., 96.
The refusal to hear a motion to dissolve an injunction or to consider an answer, in order to determine
the weight and scope of exceptions to it, is equivalent to overruling the motion to dissolve, and is appealable,
it the chancellor think this necessary or proper to settle the principles of the case. O'Conner v. Starke, 59
Miss., 481.
An appeal from a chancery court on exceptions to an answer for insufficiency or impertinence does not
lie. Clay Co. v. Chickasaw Co., 63 Miss., 289.
A decree dissolving an injunction and awarding damages on a motion to dissolve, is an interlocutory
decree. Wilson v. Pugh, 61 Miss., 449.
An appeal from a decree in vacation, under the section, perfected at the time of the decree by giving the
required bond, is as if perfected during term time; and in such case a summons to the opposite party is un
necessary; but if the bond be afterwards given, summons is necessary. Neel v. Neel, 61 Miss., 630.
If appeals under the section are improvident)? granted, the supreme court, of its own motion, will dismiss
them. Ward v. Whitfield, 64 Miss.. 754.

another prosecution of the defendant for the same offense.
(2) From a judgment actually acquitting a defendant where a question of law
has been decided adversely to the state; but in such case the appeal shall not sub
ject the defendant to further prosecution, nor shall the judgment of acquittal be
reversed, but the supreme court shall nevertheless decide the question of law pre
sented.
(3) From a ruling adverse to the state in every case in which a defendant is con
victed and prosecutes an appeal; and in such case the whole record shall be carried

lars shall be sufficient, or the appellant may deposit that sum with the clerk in lieu

resentatives of any who have died, as may be necessary to secure the rights of the
party entitled to such decree ; and a decree for the sums assessed and for costs shall

It is unnecessary for all the appellants who unite in the appeal to execute the bond Hudson v. Gray,
58 Miss., 589

to deposit a sufficient sum of money to cover costs, he shall have an appeal without
bond or deposit for costs; and his appeal shall stay the judgment appealed from.
The bond, affidavit, or deposits for costs, is required in order to stay the judgment in all criminal cises.
Taking bail and discharging the prisoner after conviction, on appeal, is unauthorized until the section is com
plied with, turn v. State, 66 Miss., 389.
Where the sentence in a capital case is imprisonment for life, on an appeal, the defendant, to have a stay

the person deprived of his liberty on the same terms and conditions as are provided

129

64-67

APPEALS.

bail in any case held not to be one in which the party is entitled to bail. In all other
cases an appeal from a judgment on trial of a writ of habeas corpus may be had on
the terms prescribed for appeals in civil cases, where a supersedeas is not desired.
64 (2339). Bail after conviction of misdemeanor.—In all cases of conviction
of a misdemeanor, an appeal taken shall stay the judgment appealed from; and the
appellant, if sentenced to imprisonment for his offense, or to stand committed until
his fine and costs shall be paid, may be relieved from such imprisonment or com
mitment, pending his appeal, by giving bond, with sufficient sureties, freeholders
in this state, to be approved by the clerk of the court from which the appeal is
taken, payable to the state in the penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor
more than one thousand dollars, to be determined by such clerk, with reference to
the grade of the offense, as indicated by the judgment, and the ability of the ap

among the papers of the case.
66 (2341). Bail, after conviction of felony, discretionary.—A persou con
victed of felony shall not be entitled to be released from imprisonment pending an
appeal to the supreme court, unless it be so ordered by the court in which the con
viction was had, or by the supreme court, or by the judge who presided at the con
viction, or the judge of the district in which such conviction was had, or a judge
of the supreme court in a vacation of said court; and the making of such order
shall be a matter of discretion with either court or judge, to be exercised with the
greatest caution, and only when the peculiar circumstances of the case render it
proper in the opinion of the court or judge.
It is improper to admit to bail, pending an appeal, one convicted of a felony, because he has a crop
which needs his attention, and the forced neglect of which will result in his financial ruin, and because his
wife is frail and delicate. Bail is a special favor, to be granted, not on personal grounds, but under peculiar
circumstances, 10 be judged of as a matter of sound judicial discretion. Hill v. State, 64 Miss., 431.
67 (2342). Amount of bail fixed by judge. — Where an order shall be made as
provided in the last section, the court or judge shall designate the amount of the
bond to be given ; and the clerk of the court where the conviction was had shall take
bond of the appellant and sureties, being freeholders in this state, to be approved by
him, in the sum fixed by the order, payable to the state, and conditioned for the
appearance of the party in the supreme court and circuit court to abide by and per
form such sentence or judgment as may be rendered in the case; or the supreme
court or circuit court, or any judge of either court making such order for bail, may
take and approve the bond required to be given, or it may be taken by the sheriff
in whose custody such prisoner may be, and shall be sent to the supreme court.

before the supreme court.
68 (2344). Duty of clerk when appeal is taken.—When the appellant shall
have complied with the law applicable to his appeal, the clerk of the court from
which the appeal is taken shall immediately make and certify a transcript of the
record of the case, and transmit it and the appeal-bond taken, except the bail-bond
in cases of misdemeanor, to the clerk of the supreme court; and in all civil cases,
where the appeal is not perfected during the term of the court at which the judg
ment or decree complained of is rendered, he shall issue a summons to the opposite
party to appear and answer the appeal in the supreme court. A copy of the appealbond shall be kept by the clerk as a part of the record of the case, and judgment
may be rendered by the supreme court against the obligors in the bond without
notice, or the representatives of any who have died after due notice; and in cases
remanded to the court below to ascertain the amount recoverable on any such bond,
the copy kept in the clerk's office shall be admissible in evidence, or the original
may be obtained from the clerk of the supreme court for use in the court below.
When an appeal is granted by the court in term time, the appellee is presumed to be present, and is
bound to take notice of its allowance. Hospital v. Knox, 57 Miss., 600.

time of the decree, it is as if perfected in term time. Neel v. Neel, 61 Miss., 630.

state, giving
and
as the sureties on his cost-bond, and

■circuit court, as in cases of appeal from justices of the peace; and in any cause so
removed by certiorarL.the court shall be confined to the examination of questions
of law arising or appearing on the face of the record and proceedings. In case of
an affirmance of the judgment of the justice, the same judgment shall be given as

as the justice ought to have entered, if the same be apparent, or may then try the
cause anew on its merits, and may in proper cases enter judgment on the certiorari

The defendant in a certiorari proceeding must have notice. Copeland v. Pate, 6 How. (Miss ), 275.

same party in the same case. Williams v. Williams, 34 Miss., 143.
Unless the amount in controversy exceed fifty dollars in cases brought by certiorari from a justice of
the peace to the circuit court, an appeal will not be allowed from the circuit court in such case to the supreme
court. O'Leary v. Harris, 50 Miss., 13.
It is the duty of the party who sues out a certiorari to appear in the circuit court and point out the
errors, if any exist; and if he fail to do so, he cannot complain in the supreme court of a judgment by
default affirming the justice's judgment, rendered in the circuit court. O'Leary v. Bolton. 50 Miss., 172.
An interlocutory order, entered by a justice of the peace, will not warrant the carrying of the case by
certiorari to the circuit court. Morris v. Shryock, 50 Miss., 590.

court, and entry upon trial without noticing the defects in the petition, is a waiver of all objections to the
writ. Moore v. Ernst, 54 Miss., 642.

go-94

APPEALS.

affirmance or a reversal of the justice's judgment, and not a dismissal of the writ. Burrow v. Sanders, 57
Miss., 211.
90. Certiorari to all other inferior tribunals.—Like proceedings as provided
in the last section may be had to review the judgments of all tribunals inferior to

to the circuit court, the said court, on motion of the appellee or obligee, may in
quire into the sufficiency of the amount of the bond, and of the security thereon^
and may at any time require a new bond, or additional security, on pain of dismissal ;
and if any bond be defective, the principal therein may give a new one, which shall
have the same effect as if given originally.
Where an appeal-bond is defective in any respect, the circuit court should permit it to be amended.
Gaddis v. Palmer, 60 Miss., 758; Leavenworth v. Crittenden, 62 Miss., 573; James v. Woods, 65 Miss., 528.
92 (2334). How executors, administrators, and guardians appeal. —Execu
tors, administrators, and guardians, except those who have not given bonds as such,
may appeal from any judgment, decree, or order affecting them in their fiduciary
character, and shall have a supersedeas on such appeal, without bonds for cost or
for supersedeas; but in appeals to the supreme court they may be required to prepay
the clerk for the transcript of record.
The section does not relieve an executor against whom a decree has been rendered to be satisfied de bonis
propriis from giving bond. Hudson v. Gray, 58 Miss., 589.
But the appeal may be without bond, if by the executor in his fiduciary character onlv. Hudson v.
Gray, 58 Miss., 591.
93 (2333). State, county, municipality, and public officers may appeal with
out bond.—The state, and any county, city, town, or village thereof, and the officials
representing the state, county, city, town, or village, in any suit or action, and any
state, county, city, town, or village officer who is a party to any suit or action in
his official character, in which suit or action the state, county, city, town, or village
is beneficially interested, and the several incorporated charitable or educational in
stitutions established and maintained by the state, shall be entitled to appeal from
a judgment, decree, decision, or order of any court or judge, from which an appeal
may be taken, without giving an appeal-bond; and in such case, if an appeal-bond
would operate as a supersedeas, in favor of a private person, the appeal, without a
bond, shall have the same effect in the cases herein provided for ; and this provision
shall apply to all the courts of the state.
A pi tition for a mandamus in behalf of the state, to compel the board of supervisors of a county to
hold a special election to locate the county site, having been denied, the state can appeal without bond. State

94. Written demand for appeal in certain cases.—In all cases where an appeal
is desired without bond, from a judgment of a justice of the peace, and in cases of
unlawful entry and detainer, by parties who are not required to give bond therefor,

ARBITRATION AND AWARD.
95. Who may submit to arbitration.—All persons, except infants and persons
of unsound mind, may, by instrument of writing, submit to the decision of one or
more arbitrators any controversy which may be existing between them, which

made pursuant to such submission. In such case, however, should the parties
agree upon a court without jurisdiction of the subject-matters of the award, the
judgment shall be rendered by the court having jurisdiction in the county of the
residence of the party, or some one of them, against whom the award shall be made.
An attorney at law, as such, lias no power to submit his client's controversy which is not in suit to arbi

where he is interested in the subject-matter in dispute, nor where he is related, by
consanguinity or affinity, to any of the parties to the arbitration.
97. Arbitrators to appoint time of meeting, etc., and notify parties.—The
arbitrators thus selected shall appoint a time and place for the hearing, and notify
the parties thereof, and shall adjourn the hearing from time to time, as may be
necessary, and on the application of either party, and for good cause may postpone
the hearing to a time not extending beyond the day fixed in the submission, if a
day be fixed, for rendering the award.
98. Notice to parties ; how given and form of.—The notice which the arbi
trators shall give to the parties of the time and place of the hearing of the contro
versy shall be in writing, and may be in the following form, viz. :
" To

[naming all of the parties] :
" You are notified that the undersigned arbitrators, agreed upon by you to de
termine the controversy mentioned in your articles of submission, of date the

"Arbitrators."
Such notice shall be served by delivering to each of the parties a copy thereof

ARBITRATION AND AWARD.

99. Arbitrators to be sworn.— Before proceeding to hear any testimony in rela
tion to the matter, the arbitrators shall be sworn, by some officer authorized to admin
ister an oath, to faithfully and impartially hear and determine the matters submitted
to them, according to the evidence and the manifest justice and equity of the case,
to the best of their judgment, without favor or affection.
100. All arbitrators to meet, etc.; majority may award, when.—AH arbitra
tors must meet together and hear all of the allegations and evidence of the parties
pertinent or material to the cause; but the parties may mutually waive, in writing,
the appearance of all of the arbitrators named in the articles of submission and
consent for those present to proceed, or they may, in like manner, substitute other
persons for the absent ones ; but an award made, and every other act done by a
majority of the arbitrators, shall be valid unless the concurrence of all or a certain
number of the arbitrators to the award or acts be expressly required in the sub
mission.
101. Witness to be sworn; legal process for. —All witnesses before arbitra
tors shall be sworn as if before a court, and the parties shall have the benefit of
legal process to compel the attendance of witnesses, which may be issued by the
clerk of any court or a justice of the peace, and shall require the witness to attend
before the arbitrators on a day and at a place certain to be named in the subpuma.
102. Process; by whom executed. —The sheriff, constable, or any person agreed
upon in writing by the parties, may execute process returnable before arbitrators.
103. Penalty for disobeying process. —If any person duly subpoenaed to appear
before arbitrators and testif}-, shall fail to do so, he shall be guilty of contempt of
the court from which, or by whose clerk, the process issued, and upon complaint
thereto of the party injured, the court or justice may punish the person for such
contempt as in other like cases.
104. Award to be signed, and how.— To entitle an award to be enforced ac
cording to the provisions of this chapter, it must be made in writing, and be signed
by the arbitrators making the same and who concur therein. The arbitrators shall
attach to the award the articles of submission, the notice served on the parties, with
indorsements of service, and if the parties appear the fact should be noted in the
award itself; and they shall give a duplicate of the whole to each of the parties to
the controversy, and the duplicates shall each be treated as originals.
It is essential to the validity of an award that it shall be final and complete, responsive to all the matters
of difference included in the submission. (Said of a common law award ! Rhodes v. Hardy, 53 Miss., 587.
The award is an extinguishment of all causes of action submitted. Jones v. Harris, 58 Miss., 293.
105. Award; how confirmed by court, etc.—Upon such submission and award
being presented to the court designated in the submission, or having jurisdiction of
the subject-matter of the award, the court shall, upon motion, confirm the award,
unless the same be vacated or modified, or a decision thereon be postponed, as
herein provided. An award shall not be confirmed unless notice, in writing, of
such motion shall have been served on the adverse party at least five days before
the hearing, to be served as other process ; but such motion shall not be made after
the expiration of one year from the making and publication of the award.
106. Award; how vacated and for what causes. —Any party complaining of
an award may move the court to vacate the same upon any of the following
grounds:
140

ARBITRATION AND AWARD.

IO7-IIO

(a) That such award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means ;
(b) That there was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators,
or any one of them ;
(c) That the abitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the
hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent or
material to the controversy, or other misbehavior by which the rights of the party
shall have been prejudiced ;
(d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or that they so imperfectly ex
ecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award on the subject-matter was not
made.
The arbitrators must consider every thing submitted to them, and, if they refuse to do so, the award is not
binding. (This was a common law award.) Tucker v. Gordon, 7 How. (Miss.), 306.
107. Award ; how modified and corrected.—Any party to the submission may
also move the couct to modify or correct the award in the following cases:
(a) Where there is an evident miscalculation of figures, or an evident mistake
in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in such award;
(h) Where the arbitrators shall have awarded upon some matter not submitted
to them, nor affecting the merits of the decision of the matter submitted;
(c) Where the award shall be imperfect in some matter of form, not affecting
the merits of the controversy, and when, if it had been a verdict of a jury ren
dered in such court, the defect could have been amended or disregarded by the
court.
The award should be in accordance with the submission, and not extend to subjects not submitted nor to
strangers. Gibson v. Powell, 5 Smed. & M., 712.
For a case in which a mistake was corrected without a statute, see Robertson v. Wells, 28 Miss., 90.
108. Motion to vacate or modify award; when made, etc.—An application tovacate or modify an award shall be made to the court at the term next after the
making and publication of the award, upon at least five days' notice, in writing,
being given to the adverse party, if there he time for that purpose; and if there be
not time, such court, or the judge thereof, may, upon good cause shown, order a
stay of proceedings upon the award, either absolutely or upon such terms as shall
appear just, until the next succeeding term of court.
109. Award may be vacated, modified, or corrected, or new hearing di
rected, when.—On such application the court may vacate the award in any of the
cases specified, and if the time within which the award shall have been required to
be made by the articles of submission has not expired, may, in its discretion, direct
a new hearing by the arbitrators ; and, in the cases specified, the court may modify
and correct the award so as to effect the intent thereof, and to promote justice be
tween the parties.
110. Judgments; when and how rendered.—Upon such award being con
firmed or modified, the court shall render judgment in favor of any person to whom
a sum of money shall have been awarded, that he recover the same ; and if the
award adjudge any person entitled to specific personal property, the court shall
render judgment that such person do have and recover the property, or its value,
from the party against whom the award is made, as judgments are rendered in
actions of replevin; and if the possession of land be awarded to either party, judg

CHAPTER 9.
ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.
125 (2414). In what cases a remedy.—The remedy by attachment shall apply to
all actions or demands founded upon any indebtedness, or for the recovery of dam
ages for the breach of any contract, express or implied, and to actions founded upon
any penal statute.
In order to entitle a party to an attachment, he must have a present subsisting debt or demand; a mere
surety cannot attach. Henderson v. Thornton, 37 Miss., 448.
The remedy does not extend to actions ex delicto. Fellows v. Brown, 38 Miss., 541.
A non-resident of the state may attach another non-resident. Barrow v. Burbridge, 41 Miss., 622.
A county can sue out an attachment. State, use, etc., y. Fortenberry, 54 Miss., 316.
Wherever assumpsit will lie for the breach of an implied contract the case is within the statute. Netherly v. Belden, 66 Miss., 490.
An attachment will lie to recover for a breach of warranty. Hambrick v. Wilkins, 65 Miss., 18.
126. Suit against one or more of joint debtors.—Tbe creditor may sue out an
attachment against one or more of joint debtors or joint and several debtors, whether
primarily or secondarily liable, without affecting his rights as against the others.
127. Attachment against partners.—In case any one or more partners shall
be liable to attachment on any of the enumerated grounds therefor, save tbe first,
an attachment may be maintained against said partner, or all of the partners, by the
partnership creditors; and the propert}7 of the partnership, in either case, may be
levied on and dealt with in all respects as if the grounds of attachment existed as
to all of the partners; and the effects levied upon may be replevied by the partners
sued by giving bond as other defendants in attachments, or, if they fail to do so,
any partner not sued therein may replevy the same in like manner; but, by doing
so, such partner shall thereby become a party defendant to the suit for all purposes,
and judgment may be rendered on his bond against the obligors therein as in other
attachment cases.
128 (2420). Attachment against non-residents jointly indebted.—When two
or more persons, not residing in this state, are jointly indebted, the writ of attach
ment may be issued against such debtors, or any of them, by their proper names or
by the name of the partnership, or by whatever other name such debtors may be
called or known in this state, or against the executors or administrators of them or
any or either of them, and may be levied upon the separate or joint estate or both
of such debtors, and the lands, tenements, money, goods, chattels, effects, rights,
and credits of such debtors, or any or either of them, which shall be liable to be
seized and taken for the satisfaction of any debt or demand for which an attach
ment will lie.
129 (2415). Affidavit.—The creditor, his agent or attorney, shall make oath be
fore a judge of the supreme court, a judge of a circuit court, or a chancellor; or
before a clerk of a circuit court or chancery court or the deputy of such clerk, or
any justice of the peace, or the mayor of any city, town, or village, of the amount
of his debt or demand, to the best of his knowledge and belief, and shall also make
oath to one or more of the following grounds for attachment :
145
10

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.
(1) That the defendant is a foreign corporation, or a non-resident of this
state ; or
(2) That he has removed, or is about to remove, himself or his property out of
this state ; or
(3) That he so absconds or conceals himself that he cannot be served with a sum
mons ; or
(4) That he contracted the debt or incurred the obligation in conducting the
business of a ship, steam-boat, or other water-craft in some of the navigable waters
of this state ; or
(5) That he has property or rights in action which he couceals, and unjustly re
fuses to apply to the payment of his debts ; or
(6) That he has assigned or disposed of, or is about to assign or dispose of his
property or rights in action, or some part thereof, with the intent to defraud his
creditors; or
(7) That he has converted, or is about to convert, his property into money or evi
dences of debt, with intent to place it beyond the reach of his creditors; or
(8) That he fraudulently contracted the debt or incurred the obligation for which
suit has been or is about to be brought ; or
(9) That he is buying, selling, or dealing in, or has, within six months next be
fore the suing out of the attachment, directly or indirectly bought, sold, or dealt in
future contracts, commonly called " futures ; " or
(10) That he is in default for public money, due from him as a principal, to the
state, or some county, city, town, or village thereof; or
(11) That defendant is a banker, banking company or corporation, and received
deposits of money knowing at the time he or it was insolvent ; or has made or pub
lished a false or fraudulent statement as to his or its financial condition.
The attachment law applies to transactions occurring before its adoption as well as afterwards. Green
v. Anderson, 39 Miss., 35!).
Where cause for attachment is shown for only a part of the debt, and the court has no jurisdiction of so
small an amount as that part, the whole attachment must fail. Delmas v. Morrison, 61 Miss., 314.
A creditor asked a justice of the peace to prepare papers for an attachment against his debtor, telling
him the amount of the debt and the grounds of attachment; and the justice wrote an affidavit, bond, and writ, and
handed them to him, asking "if that was all right," and the creditor answered that it was The affidavit was
not signed, and an oath was not administered or attempted to be administered. Held : There was no affidavit,
and the levy based thereon was invalid, and a subsequent amendment could not validate the proceedings so
as to affect intervening rights. Carlisle v. Gunn, 68 Miss., 243.
Whether a paper, in form an affidavit, is really one is not determinable by what either of the parties con
sidered in reference to it, but by the inquiry whether any thing was done which could properly be construed
as taking or administering an oath. Carlisle v. Gunn, 6S Miss., 243.
It is unnecessary for the agent who makes the affidavit to affirm therein that he is agent; the certificate
of the officer to that effect is sufficient evidence of the fact. Lindner v. Aaron, 5 How. (Miss ), 581.
It is unnecessary for the affidavit to be in the exact language of the statute; substantial compliance is
sufficient. Wallis v. Wallace, 6 How. (Miss.), 254.
The affidavit is not invalid because not signed by the affiant. Redus v. Wofford, 4 Smed. & M., 579.
An affidavit which recites the reasons of affiant's belief of the existence of the grounds of attachment
is not because of the recitals invalid. Spear v. King, 6 Smed. & M., 276.
The affidavit may be made in another state and before a commissioner for this state; the statute does not
require that the writ of attachment shall be issued by the officer before whom the affidavit is made. Griffing
v. Mills, 40 Miss., 611.
It is erroneous to state several causes for attachment in the affidavit disjunctively. Bishop v. Finnerty,
46 Miss., 570.
Domicile and residence are not convertible terras, and one having a domicile in this state may j-et be a
non-resident in the meaning of the law. Alston v. Newcomer, 42 Miss., 186.
The test of one's non-residence is whether the absence is of such character and so prolonged that he can
not be served with ordinary process. Morgan v. Nunes, 54 Miss., 308.
146

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

I3O-I32

If a defendant have remaining in the state, and which he is not about to remove, ample property to sat
isfy, and which is liable to his debts, then the mere removal of some other property from tbe state will not
subject him to attachment. Montague v. Gaddis, 37 Miss., 453.
If the purpose to remove exist, and may be carried out in one, two, three, or several weeks or months,
though the debtor's movements be not characterized by fright, speed, or haste, he is liable to attachment, if
the object be to defeat or defraud or delay creditors. Myers v. Farrell, 47 Miss., 281
To sustain an attachment on the ground that the debtor has removed, or is about to remove, his property
out of the state, it is sufficiei t for the plaintiff to show that the defendant has removed, or is about to remove,
any of his property out of the state; and then it devolves on the defendant to show, if he can. that he has
other, ample, visible property to satisfy all claims against him, unless such fact appear from the plaintiff's
evidence. Pickard v. Samuels, 64 Miss., 822.
Under the statute subjecting to attachment one who " has removed, or is about to remove, ... hie
property out of the state," a merchant, though insolvent, who ships cotton to his commission merchant in
another state, for sale to pay a debt exceeding the value of the cotton, is not liable to attachment. Lowenstein v. Bew, 68 Miss., 265.
•
To sustain an attachment on the ground of the fraudulent disposition of property, the plaintiff mny rest
on evidence which shows such disposition, in case the defendant owns no other property; the ownership of
other and ample property, liable to his debts, must be shown by defendant, unless it appear trom the plaint
iff's evidence. Pickard v. Samuels, 64 Miss , 822.
A purpose to defraud at the time is necessary in order to constitute the fraudulent contraction of the
debt. Marqueze v. Sontheimer, 59 Miss., 430.
Although the defendant commit a felony in contracting the debt sued for, to sustain the attachment it
must be shown that in so doing he intended to defraud the plaintiff. The statute defining the felony in this
case was intended for the protection of the public. Hughes v. Lake. 63 Miss., 552.
A false warranty, knowingly made, is evidence of a fraudulent contraction of the debt. Hambriek v.
Wilkins, 65 Miss., 18.
130 (2416). Bond.—The creditor, his agent or attorney, shall also give bond,
with a sufficient surety or sureties, to be approved by the officer issuing the attach
ment, in double the sum for which the complaint is made, payable to the defendant
and conditioned to the effect following, to wit:
" The condition of the above obligation is that, whereas, the above bound
prays an attachment against the estate of the said
for the sum of
dollars, returnable to the
court of
, on the
day of
next:
" Now, if the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant all such damages as he shall
sustain by the wrongful suing out of the attachment, and all costs which may be
awarded against the plaintiff in said suit, then the obligation shall be void."
The bond, together with the affidavit for the attachment, shall be returned by
the officer taking the same to the court to which the attachment is returnable.
A bond signed by one partner, who acts for himself and as agent for his partners in suing out the attach
ment, is sufficient, though not signed by the other members of the firm. Wallis v. Wallace, 6 How. (Miss. ), 254.
A bond executed by an agent, binding himself personally and not his principal, is sufficient. Frost v.
Cook, 7 How. (Miss ). 357; Page v. Ford, 2 Smed. & M., 266.
A bond executed by the usee in the suit is good. Grand Gulf v. Conger, 9 Smed. & M., 505.
In case of the execution of bond by the officers of a corporation for their company, the presumption is
that the instrument has been rightly executed. Saunders v. Columbus, 43 Miss., 583.
131 (2417). Bond by an agent.—If the bond purport to be executed by an agent
or attorney of the attaching creditor, it shall be prima facie evidence that the agent
or attorney had due authority to act.
132 (2464). Bond excepted to ; new bond and affidavit.—When it shall ap
pear to the court, on exceptions taken by the defendant or otherwise, that the
sureties on any attachment-bond are insufficient, the court shall direct the plaintiff
to give a new bond with sufficient surety ; and such bond shall be as valid, in all
respects, as the original bond ; and, if the plaintiff fail to give a new bond within
the time required by the court, the attachment shall be dismissed ; and in all cases
-where an attachment-bond or affidavit may be defective in any respect, or may be
147

133-134

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

lost or destroyed, the plaintiff shall be allowed to file a new affidavit and bond,
which shall be, in all respects, as valid and binding as if given at the commence
ment of the suit.
Mere irregularities in the bond must be availed of by exceptions taken by the defendant; a claimant, or
the surety <m his bond, cannot object to the attachment proceedings on account thereof. Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 741.
A bond executed by a single surety, who was incapacitated to become such, is amendable. Field v. McKinney, 60 Miss., "63.
A bond signed by sureties in a partnership name may be amended by allowing each partner to sign his
own name. Boisseau v. Kahn, 62 Miss., 757.
The jurat to an affidavit may be amended by allowing the officer to subscribe his name to it. Boissean
v. Kahn, 62 Miss., 757.
An attachment proceeding will not be quashed, where an application is made to amend the affidavit, be
cause neither the officer nor the affiant signed the affidavit ; it being shown that the affidavit was in fact sworn,
to, and both parties thought every thing necessary to be done had been done, and their failure to sign was by
mere inadvertence; and this, too, even though the affiant did not ' hold up his hand and swear." (The re
port of this case omits to state, what is shown by the record, that an application to amend was made.) Dunlap v. Clay, 65 Miss., 454.
The amendment of an affidavit in attachment does not affect the lien of the writ. Griffing v. Mills, 40
Miss., 611.
133 (2418). The 'writ.—On affidavit being made and bond given, the officer ap
proving the bond shall issue one or more writs of attachment against the estate
of the debtor, directed to the sheriff, or any constable or other proper officer of the
county or counties in which the defendant shall have property or debts, and shall
be returnable to the next term of the circuit court of any county, or to the court
of a justice of the peace of any district, in cases within his jurisdiction, in which
the defendant, or property or debts of the defendant may be found, and shall be
the leading process in the suit.
Where a writ of attachment, issueil by a justice of the peace in one district, is returnable to a justice's
court to be held at a designated place in another district, and the parties appear at the place to which the
writ is return ible, and try the case before a justice of the peace other than the one who issued the writ, the
judgment is valid; and on appeal to the circuit court in such case, the certificate of the justice who tried the
case that the affidavit and bond is a part of the record in the case in his court, obviates all objections to
them on the ground that they were not executed before him. Armitage v. Rector, 62 Miss., 600.
The proper court of the county of a garnishee's residence has jurisdiction of an attachment against a
defendant to whom he is indebted, although the defendant be a householder and resident of another county.
Barnett v. Ring, 55 Miss;, 1)7; Smith v. Mulhern, 57 Miss., 591; Bautn v. Burns, 66 Miss., 124.
134 (2419). Form of the writ. —The writ shall be in the form or to the effect
following, to wit :
" The State of Mississippi.
" To the sheriff [or coroner] or any constable of
county, greeting:
"Whereas, A B [or agent or attorney of A B~\ hath complained on oath to
, one of the judges of the supreme court [or other officer, as the case may
be], that C D is justly indebted to the said A B to the amount of §
, and
that the said C D is a non-resident, etc. [reciting the affidavit], and bond and
security having been given according to the statute :
" We therefore command you, that you attach the said C D by his estate, real
and personal, in your county to the value of the said demand and costs of suit, and
that you safely keep the same according to law, so as to compel the said C D to
appear before the
court [or before the court of
, a justice of the peace
of
district], to be held at
, in and for the county of
, on the
Monday of
, to answer the above complaint. And that you summon the said
148

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

135-138

C D, if to be found in your county, to appear and answer accordingly; and have
there then this writ, with your proceedings thereon.
" Witness ray hand, this
day of
A.D.
."
The writ shall be signed by the officer granting the same, or, if issued by a clerk
or his deputy, shall be dated, signed, and sealed as other writs; and an attachment
shall not be quashed or abated for want of form if the substantial matters expressed
in the foregoing precedent be contained therein ; and, on the demand of the plaint
iff, said writ may embody a garnishment.
135 (2421). Duplicate and alias writs.—The officer granting an attachment
may issue duplicate writs to any other county in which the defendant may have
property or debts due him, which writs shall be returnable to the court to which
the original is returnable, and shall be executed and returned in like manner; and
where the attachment has not been executed, or where no property has been found,
or not sufficient to satisfy the debt, or where the plaintiff desires to garnish other
persons, the clerk of the court to which the same is returnable may issue alias writs
to the same or other counties without a renewal of the bond or affidavit.
It is not required that the duplicate writs should have indorsed thereon that they are duplicates. Saun
ders v. Columbus, 43 Miss., 583.
The service of an alias attachment writ, returnable to a court, will give the court jurisdiction. Barneit
v. Ring, 55 Miss., 97.
.
136 (2423). Writ to be served, on what, and what bound by the levy.—The
officer receiving the writ of attachment shall forthwith levy the same, according to
law, on the property of the defendant, real and personal, wherever found; and he
shall summon, as garnishees, by writs of garnishment, to be issued and served by
himself, and duly returned, all persons indebted to the defendant, or having in pos
session effects belonging to him, to appear at the court to which the attachment is
returnable, there to answer as required by law; and he shall seize the books of
accounts and other evidence of debt belonging to the defendant, and levy on the
stock, shares, or interest of the defendant in any corporation, joint-stock company,
or copartnership. All the property, debts, choses in action, stock, shares, aud inter
est of the defendant attached, shall be bound by the levy from the date thereof.
The seizure of the books of accounts and the choses in action creates no lien; this can be acquired oniy
by service of notice on the garnishees. Boone v. Mcintosh, G2 Miss., 744.
Whatever may be true of the validity of the levy, a junior creditor cannot question it, unless he has pro
cured such a levy upon the property in his own case as will give him precedence. Scharff v. Chaffe, 68 Miss.,
641.
137 (2423). The defendant to be summoned. —The officer serving the attach
ment shall summon the defendant, if to he found, to appear and answer the action,
as in other cases.
138 (2426). Proceeding when levy by other than sheriff.—If a writ of
attachment, returnable to the circuit court, be served by a constable, coroner, or
marshal, or by any person specially appointed for that purpose, the writ of attach
ment, with the return thereon of the action of such person and all property and
effects levied on, shall forthwith be delivered to the sheriff of the proper county,
who shall be responsible for the property so seized, and shall return the writ to the
proper court, with a statement of his action under it; but if the sheriff be a party,
the officer serving the attachment shall make the return, and so state therein, and
149

139-143

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

likewise retain the property, unless the court, or judge in vacation, make an order
for the safe-keeping and forthcoming thereof.
The circuit court has no jurisdiction of an attachment returned by a constable uuless the sheriff be a
party. Tucker v. Byars, 46 Miss., 549; Barnett v. Ring, 55 Miss., 97.
139 (2471). May be issued and served on Sunday. — Attachments may in all
cases be issued and executed on Sunday; and may be executed in any part of the
county, by any constable of the county, or by the constable or police officer of any
municipality, in the same manner as the sheriff of the county; and in cases of
emergency, and when a sheriff or his deputy, or a constable or police officer cannot
be had in time, the officer issuing an attachment may appoint some reputable per
son to execute such attachment; and such officer shall be liable on his bond and in
dividually, for the consequence of appointing an insolvent or incompetent person
for such service.
140 (2425). Writ and bonds returned. —The officer serving an attachment
shall make a full return thereon of all his proceedings, on or before the return-day
of the writ. He shall deliver to the court or clerk all bonds which he may have
taken pursuant to law.
It cannot be presumed that the officer levied upon any property other than that enumerated in his rpturti
on the writ. Phillips v. Harvey, 50 Miss., 489.
141 (2461). Ancillary attachment. —When a suit shall have been commenced,
the plaintiff may obtain an attachment against the defendant, or one or more of
them, on making affidavit and giving bond as required in other cases of attach
ment, which attachment shall be granted, issued, executed, and returned by the
same officers; and the like proceedings, as far as applicable, shall be had thereon as
in other cases; and the affidavit, bond, and writ, when returned, shall be tiled with
the papers in the original suit, which shall not be delayed thereby.
142 (2459). Attachment for debt not due.—When any creditor whose debt is
not due, shall make affidavit of any of the five last grounds for an attachment, or
that he has just cause to suspect, and verily believes, that his debtor will remove
himself or his effects out of the state before the said debt will become payable, with
intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or that he hath removed, with like
intent, leaving property in this state, and shall give bond as in other cases, he may
obtain an attachment in the county where the debtor resides, or last resided, or
where his property may be'found ; which attachment shall be issued, executed, and
returned, and the like proceedings had thereon as in other cases of attachment.
143 (2437). Publication of notice. — When any writ of attachment shall be
executed and returned, if the defendant be not summoned, the clerk of the court
shall cause a notice to be published, once a week for three weeks, in some news
paper published within the county, or in some convenient county, and having a cir
culation in the county in which the suit is pending, stating the issuance of such
attachment, at whose suit, against whose estate, for what sum, and in what court
the same is pending, and that unless the defendant appear on the first day of the
next succeeding term of the court and plead to said action, judgment will be
entered, and the estate attached will be sold. Such publication may be made before
or after the return-term of the court; but in cases of attachment against persons
residing out of this state, the creditor, his agent or attorney, shall file with the

clerk his affidavit —if the affidavit for the attachment do not contain such state
ment—showing the post-office of the defendant, or that he has made diligent
inquiry to ascertain it without success ; and if the post-office shall be stated, the
clerk shall send by mail to such defendant, at his post-office, a copy of such notice,
and shall make it appear to the court that he has done so, before judgment shall be
rendered on publication of notice; and for a failure of duty in this respect, the
clerk may be punished as for contempt.
Publication is to be made after the levy of the writ, if the defendant be not summoned. GriflSng v. Mills,
40 Miss., 611.
»
Where there is no return showing a service of process on defendant, and no affidavit as required, although
publication be made and be mailed, a judgment by default will be void. Drysdale v. Biloxi, 67 Miss., 534.
144 (2438). When publication unnecessary.—Such publication of notice shall
not be necessary if it shall' be served on the non-resident defendant, and proof of
such service be made as provided for in case of non-resident defendants in chan
cery ; but such proof of service of notice shall be as effectual as if such defendant
had been served with a summons.
Personal service of summons in another state, as authorized by § 3423, will not justify a personal judg
ment. Cudabac v. Strong, 67 Miss., 705.
145 (2439). Form of notice required.—The notice of the attachment which the
clerk is required to cause to be published may be in the following form, to wit:
" The State of Mississippi to
:
"An attachment at the suit of
against your estate, for
dollars,
returnable before the circuit court of
county, at
, Mississippi, has
been executed, and is now pending in said court; and unless you appear before
said court on the
Monday of
, A.D.
, and plead to said action, judg
ment will be entered, and the estate attached will be sold.
, Clerk."
"
;>A.D.
."
146 (2440). If no newspaper.—If there should be no newspaper published
within the county in which the attachment is pending, or in a convenient county,
such notice shall be posted at the door of the court-house of the county, and that
shall be instead of publication in a newspaper.
147 (2427). Property may be replevied.—The defendant, at any time before
final judgment, may replevy the personal property seized and taken into possession
by the officer serving an attachment, by giving to such officer a bond, with sufficient
sureties, to be approved by him, payable to the plaintiff*, in double the value of such
property, conditioned to have said property forthcoming to answer and abide the
judgment of the court in said suit, or, in default thereof, to pay and satisfy the
judgment to the extent of the value of said property ; and, on the execution of such
bond, the officer shall restore to the defendant the property so replevied, and shall
return the bond so taken with the writ of attachment and all his proceedings
thereon. Such replevin shall not affect the lien of the attachment, or the proceed
ings thereon, as to any rights, credits, or choses in action of the defendant.
The execution of a replevy-bond by the defendant before the return-day of the writ is equivalent to per
sonal service of process on him, and renders him personally amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. Rich
ard v. Mooney, 39 Miss., 357.
The surety on the bond cannot plead to the action, or interpose any defense, or complain of any errors
in the action against his principal ; but he may contest his original liability on the bond or bIiow a discharge
from liability. Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 733
151

148-153

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

A surety on a replevin-bond is only liable for the value of the property, and the jury must find the
value. Bedon v. Alexander, 47 Miss., 254; Phillips v. Harvey, 50 Miss., 489.
148 (2477). Form of bond for replevin of goods—The defendant's replevinbond may be in the following form, viz.:
*v
" We,
, principal, and
and ———,
sureties, bind ourselves to pay
dollars, unless the said
shall have forthcoming, to abide the judg
ment of the circuit court of
county, in the suit by attachment therein pend
ing in which said

day of

county by virtue of said attachment, and valued by .him at'

extent of the value of said property, to replevy which tliis bond is given.

((
149. But one bond required, etc.—If personal property be seized under an
attachment writ, and the defendant, or a claimant, replevy the ,same, giving bond
therefor, he shall not be deprived of the property under a subsequent attachment
against the same defendant, returnable to the same court to which the first writ is
returnable; nor shall but one replevy-bond be required. The bond given to the
plaintiff in the first attachment shall inure to the benefit of the plaintiff in any
subsequent attachment, and judgment may be rendered thereon as if it had been
made payable to the plaintiff in the subsequent attachment. The officer shall show
in his return on a subsequent attachment writ, what prior attachments in same
court have been levied upon the property, if any, and whether the property has
been replevied therein, naming the sureties on the bond.
150. Execution not to issue against sureties, unless, etc. — Where the amount
demanded in an untried prior attachment, or the judgment, if the same be tried,
shall equal or exceed the value of the property replevied, an execution, or other
process, shall not be issued against the sureties on the replevin-bond on a judgment
in a subsequent attachment, unless the prior attachment fail, or the judgment
therein be satisfied otherwise than by the proceeds of the property replevied.
151. Loss of priority, etc.—If the plaintiff in a prior attachment fail to enforce
his judgment, after ten days' written notice to do so by the plaintiff in a subsequent
attachment, he shall lose his priority; but where the amount of the prior attach
ment shall be less than the value of the property, process may issue on the subse
quent judgment against the sureties on the replevin-bond for the difference between
the amount of the prior attachment and the value of the property as shown in the"
officer's return.
152. One satisfaction releases sureties.—If the value of the property be paid
by the sureties, or the property surrendered as provided in the bond, the judgment
in the subsequent attachment shall, as to the sureties on the replevin-bond, be
satisfied.
153. Prior attachment from another court.—Execution or other process shall
not issue against the sureties on a replevin-bond where the property replevied hath

been levied upon and replevied in a prior attachment against the same defendant,
returnable to another court, unless the amount of the prior attachment and prob
able costs thereof be first deducted from the value of the property; and in such
case execution may issue against the sureties on]y for the difference.
154 (2428). Bond to discharge attachment for a debt due.—If any defendant
in attachment for a debt due shall, at any time before the return thereof, execute
and deliver to the officer serving the same, a bond, with two or more sufficient sure
ties, to be approved by said officer, payable to the plaintiff in attachment, in a pen
alty double the amount claimed by the plaintiff, conditioned to pay and satisfy any
judgment which may be recovered by the plaintiff in the suit, with all costs, the
attachment shall be thereby discharged ; and all the property of every kind levied on,
attached, or seized hy virtue thereof, shall be released and restored to such defend
ant. The bond shall be returned with the attachment; and in case of any recovery
by the plaintiff in the suit, judgment shall be entered against the defendant and the
sureties in the said bond. After the return of the attachment, the bond herein
provided for may be given at any time before final judgment, and may be taken by
the sheriff, or officer by whom the attachment was served, in case any of the
attached property remains in his hands; otherwise, by the clerk of the court in
which the attachment is pending.
155 (2478). Form of bond in such cases.—The bond in such case may be in
the following form, viz. :
" We,
, principal, and
and
, as sureties, are held
to pay
the sum of
dollars, unless the said
shall

156. Bond to discharge attachment for a debt not due. —If a defendant in
attachment for a debt not due, shall, on or before the return-day thereof, execute and
deliver to the officer serving the same, a bond, with two or more sufficient sureties,
to be approved by said officer, payable to the plaintiff in attachment, in a penalty
double the amount claimed by the plaintiff, conditioned to pay the said debt when
it shall become payable and the costs of the attachment, the said attachment shall
be discharged thereby, and all the property attached shall be released to the de
fendant. The bond shall be delivered by the officer to the plaintiff. After the
return of the attachment, the bond herein provided for may be given at any time
before final judgment, and may be taken by the sheriff, or officer by whom the
attachment was served, in case any of the attached property remain in his hands,
or by the clerk of the court in which the attachment is pending.
157. Form of bond in such case. —The bond in such case may be in the follow
ing form, viz. :
" We,

If the constable levy on property and turn it over to the sheriff, the latter may take the discharge-bond,
even if he be the plaintiff in the suit. Forbes v. Navra, 63 Miss., !.
158 (2465). Officer bound, if bond insufficient.—If the hond or sureties given
by the defendant, or any claimant of the property, or garnishee or other person, be
insufficient, then the sheriff or other officer shall be subject to the same judgment
with the surety in such bond as if he were co-surety thereon. And the court or
judge, being satisfied that such bond is not a sufficient security, may order process
to seize the property for which the bond was given ; and when seized it shall be
dealt with as provided by law upon its seizure in the first instance under attach
ment.
This is the exclusive remedy. Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 733.
159 (2460). Claim of third person to attached property.—All the provisions
of law in relation to third persons claiming property levied on by virtue of fieri
facias shall extend and apply to claimants of property levied on by virtue of writs
of attachment. The trial of the right of property shall not be had until after
judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the attachment suit, and proceedings in gar
nishment shall be in accordance with the provisions of law on that subject. (See
§§ 4425-4436.)
If a claimant give bond, and be given the property thereon, and his claim is dismissed for want of the
proper affidavit, suit may be maintained on the bond. Higdon v. Vaughn, 58 Miss., 572.
In the trial of such issue, judgment in plaintiff's favor against the defendant in attachment is a part of
the record, and need not be ottered in evidence. French v. Sale, (iO Miss., 516.
On the frial of a claimant's issue, it is error to instruct that the judgment sustaining the attachment is
prima facie evidence against the claimant, and places upon him the burden of showing that he is a bona fide
purchaser of the goods attached As against the claimaut, such judgment is not evidence of the facts on
which it rests. Ott v. Smith, 68 Miss., 773.
160 (2462). Property of certain kind to be sold pending suit.— When goods
and chattels, levied upon under an attachment, are in danger of immediate waste
and decay, or when live-stock of any kind is so levied upon, and the same is not
replevied, the officer holding them shall sell them as like property is required to be
sold under execution. The proceeds of such sale shall be held by the officer to abide
the result of the suit, unless replevied. The owner of such goods may replevy the
same, as in other cases, at any time before sale, and after sale, the money. (See
§ 3488.)
Railroad cross-ties, though liable to be burned, are not in danger of "immediate waste and decay "
Goodman v. Moss, 64 Mis«., 303.
161 (2466). Death of defendant not to abate action.—If the defendant die
after service of the writ of attachment, the action shall not thereby be abated, but
may be prosecuted to judgment, sale, transfer, and final determination as if the
defendant's death had not occurred; and all proceedings and conveyances in such
case shall be as valid and effectual in law as if had and made in the life-time of the
defendant.
The object of the section is to authorize the court, after the attachment was served, notwithstanding the
death of the defendant, to proceed to judgment and sale, or final process, against the garnishee and property
attached. For those purposes, and to that extent, the process is strictly in rem. Holman v. Fisher, 49 Miss.,
472, citing Melius v. Houston, 41 Miss., 59.

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

l62-l66-

The administrator of the deceased defendant may appear, whether the deceased was or was not served.
Dyson v. Baker, 54 Miss., 24.
If the administrator appear, or be brought into court, a judgment in personam may be rendered against
him as such. Lowenburg v. Tironi, 62 Miss., 19.
162 (2441). The declaration and subsequent pleadings.—The declaration may
be filed on or before the return-day of the attachment or before an order of dis
missal be taken ; and the defendant shall plead thereto as in other cases, except
that, when he has pleaded in abatement of the attachment, he shall not plead to the
action until the issue made by the plea in abatement has been disposed of.
163 (2467). Judgment by default.—If the defendant shall not appear and plead
to the action, in pursuance of notice, the court, as in other cases, shall give judg
ment against him by default, and award a writ of inquirj if necessary ; but on such
judgment by default, unless granted on the service of summons executed in this
state, no execution shall issue except against the property on which the attachment
has been served, or against a garnishee who shall have money or property in hi&
hands belonging to the defendant.
A judgment against a defendant in an attachment case is, in. legal effect, a judgment of condemnation
ordering the sale of the property attached, and no formal order for sale in the judgment is necessary. Sale
v. French, 61 Miss., 170.
Although a judgment by default against a non-resident be personal in form, it cannot, if he were notified
by publication only, affect any of his property except that attached and condemned. Tabler v. Mitchell, 62
Miss., 437.
Nor can a personal judgment be sustained by service of process in another state. Cudabac v. Strong, 67
Miss., 705.
164 (2436) . Defendant may defend without replevying property. —The defend
ant in attachment may appear, without replevying the property attached, and defend
the suit as in other actions for the recovery of money; and in case the defendant
shall have been personally summoned, or shall appear and plead to the action, the
judgment therein shall have the same force and effect against the person and prop
erty of the defendant as in other actions where a summons has been personally
served on him; but such appearance shall not vacate or affect any bond taken here
under, nor discharge any garnishee, nor affect any lien created by the attachment;
but the proceedings in respect to any property attached, or any garnishee sum
moned, shall be the same as if final judgment had been entered by default.
165 (2429). Plea in abatement.—The defendant in attachment may file a plea in
abatement, verified by affidavit, traversing the truth of the alleged grounds upon
which the attachment was sued out ; and upon such plea being filed, the court shall
order a jury to be impaneled to try the issue; and if the jury shall find for the
defendant, it shall assess damages against the plaintiff' for wrongfully suing out the
same.
The issue is whether or not the attachment was rightfully sued out, and not whether the matters of fact
stated in the affidavit are true or false. The doctrine of estoppel applies. Cocke v. Kuykendall, 41 Miss , 65
Special allegations in the plea, if the plea deny the grounds, do not vitiate it; but the traverse should be
a simple denial. Ross v. Fowler, 42 Miss., '293.
166 (2430). Damages in favor of defendant.—On the trial of the issue, the
defendant may introduce evidence as to the actual damages, if any, which the issu
ance of the attachment has occasioned him ; but the defendant, when he files his plea
in abatement, shall file therewith written notice of what damages he will insist upon
at the trial. If the issue be decided for the defendant, he shall have judgment that
155

167-168

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

the attachment he discharged, and against plaintiff and the sureties in his attach
ment bond, for the damages assessed by the jury and the costs of suit; and the
jury may add to the actual damages found, a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee for
defending the issue; but the judgment against the sureties in the attachment-bond
shall not exceed the penalty thereof.
The extent of the depreciation in value between the time properly was attached, and the time the attach
ment is quashed or the property is restored, is the measure of the actual damages for preventing a sale of
the property. Fleming v. Bailey, 44 Miss., 132.
The jury has as large a scope to consider the damages on a plea traversing the grounds of attachment, as
in a suit on the attachment-bond. Fleming v. Bailey, 44 Miss., 132; Marqueze v. Sontheimer, 59 Miss.. 43d.
Where there is no malice or intent to oppress, the damages should be limited to those actually sustained ;
mere possible expectations of profits are not to lie considered. Myers v. Farrell, 47 Miss., 281.
Damages resulting from a levy by judgment creditors, subsequent to the levy of an attachment, made in
consequence of the attachment, cannot be recovered of the attaching plaintiff. Marqueze v. Sontheimer,
59 Miss., 430.
Compensation is the measure of damages. Marqueze v. Sontheimer, 59 Miss., 430.
Loss of business, as to goods attached, caused by the attachment, may be a factor in estimating damages
if proved as a matter of fact and not as a mere opinion or estimate of witnesses. Marqueze v. Sontheimer,
59 Miss.. 430
167 ("2455). Property assessed and judgment in certain cases.—If the per
sonal property attached, or any part thereof, shall have been replevied by the
defendant, the court or jury trying the issue between the parties, if it find for the
plaintiff, shall assess the value of the property so replevied by the defendant, as
well as the debt or damages due the plaintiff; and if the value of the property shall
equal the amount found due the plaintiff, judgment shall be entered against the de
fendant and his sureties on such replevin-bond, for the amount of said value; and
if the value of the property be less than the amount found due the plaintiff, judg
ment shall be entered against the defendant for the amount of the verdict, and
against the sureties in his replevin-bond for the value of the property so replevied;
and if judgment by default shall be entered in such case against the defendant, an
inquiry shall be awarded to assess the value of the property so replevied ; and on
the execution thereof judgment shall be entered as above provided. In all cases
the judgment against the sureties of the defendant shall be satisfied and discharged
by the delivery to the sheriff of the property replevied within ten days after exe
cution on such judgment shall have come to his hands; and the sheriff shall sell
the property so delivered to him, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the
execution.
A failure to comply with the statute vitiates the verdict. Young v. Pickens, 45 Miss., 553; Bedon v.
Alexander, 47 Miss., 254.
Where the attachment is levied on various articles, which are replevied, the value of each article sepa
rately should be assessed. Thoniason v. Wadlington, 53 Miss., 560; Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 733.
The sureties, when it is proposed to enter judgment against them, may show any reason, good in law, why
the bond should not be declared forfeiteil ; they may show that it is impossible to return animals bonded,
because they had died without the fault or negligence of their principal. Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 741.
If the value of the property be not assessed, it is error to render judgment for the whole of plaintiff's
demand against the sureties. Phillips v. Harvey, 50 Miss., 489.
Plaintiff cannot take judgment in the attachment against the defendant onry, the principal in the bond,
and afterwards bring a separate action againtt the sureties. McKinney v. Green, 52 Miss., 70.
168 (2432). Voluntary dismission and damages.—The plaintiff may dismiss
his attachment, but defendant shall have a jury impaneled forthwith to assess the
damage sustained by reason of suing out the attachment.
When the issue in abatement is found against several defendants, and the plaintiff, failing to establish his
debt as to one, dismisses as to him, the judgment on plea in abatement is thereby vacated as to this defend
ant, and he is entitled to have his damages assessed. Dean v. Stephenson, til Miss., 175.
156

ATTACHMENT AGAINST DEBTORS.

169-174

If such defendant fail to ask for damages or make claim for the property or its proceeds, he can neither
obtain a new trial nor appeal. Dean v. Stephenson, 61 Miss., 175.
169 (2431). Plea to the merits.—If the issue on a plea in abatement be decided
for plaintiff, the defendant shall be permitted to plead to the merits, on such termsas the court may impose.
The defendant cannot plead to the merits without waiving his plea in abatement. Lewenthal v. Missis
sippi Mills, 55 Miss., 101.
170. Judgment in case debt not due. —In determining the amount for which
judgment shall be rendered on the merits in favor of plaintiff whose debt is not
due, interest shall not be computed on the principal for a time beyond the rendi
tion of the judgment; and if the debt do not bear interest until a future day, theprincipal shall be discounted for the time to elapse before interest begins, at the rate
at which the debt will bear interest. Such judgments shall be enforced as in other
cases.
171 (2433). Judgment for damages pleadable as payment.—The judgment in
favor of the defendant against the plaintiff for the damages assessed and the costs may
be pleaded by the defendant as a payment in the same action, or in any other suit on
the same cause of action on which the attachment was sued out. An execution shall
not be issued on such judgment until after the dismissal of the action or final judg
ment on the merits. If the action be dismissed, or if, upon a trial on the merits,
judgment be in favor of the defendant, without his having obtained the benefit of
the judgment in his favor for damages and costs, he shall have execution of said
judgment in his favor. If the plaintiff recover in the trial on the merits, and
on such trial the defendant did not avail of his judgment against the plaintiff for
damages and costs, the greater recovery shall be credited with the sum of the
smaller, and judgment shall be rendered by the court in favor of the party to whom
the difference may be due.
172 (2434). Discharge of attachment not to affect action.—If the issue on a
plea in abatement be found for the defendant, the attachment shall be thereby dis
charged, and all property seized under it, and all persons summoned as garnishees,
shall be released from it; but the action, unless dismissed by the plaintiff, shall be
proceeded with in all respects as if it had been an ordinary action in its commence
ment; and the costs accruing in it, after the trial of the issue on the plea in abate
ment, shall abide the result of such action.
173 (2435). Attachment preserved by appeal.—If the plaintiff, within five
days after the expiration of the term of the court at which judgment is rendered
discharging his attachment, shall perfect an appeal from such judgment, the attach
ment shall not be discharged, nor garnishees nor property released therefrom, by
such judgment; but such appeal shall preserve the attachment in full force, to
await the result of the appeal.
The statute must be fully complied with or the lien will be discharged. If the appeal-bond lias but one
surety, when two are required, the lien will not be preserved. Pfeifer v. Hartman, 60 Miss., 505.
And if not prosecuted within five days, the lien is discharged. Lowenstein v. Powell, 68 Miss., 73.
174. Other creditors may intervene.—Any creditor of the defendant in attach
ment, upon filing a petition, under oath, averring that he is a creditor, and that
the grounds of attachment alleged are untrue, or that the attachment was sued out
by collusion between the plaintiff and the defendant, or that the debt claimed by
157

I75~I79

ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

the plaintiff is fictitious or simulated, in whole or in part, or any other fact showing
fraud or collusion in suing out the attachment, may intervene and make defense,
and in such case the facts stated in the petition shall be tried: but the intervening
creditor must give bond, payable to the plaintiff, in such penalty and with such
sureties as the court or judge may prescribe, conditioned to pay the costs of the
trial in case the issue be found against him.
175. But one trial, etc.—But one trial shall be allowed under the provisions of
the last section unless the petitions of the interventors present different issues ; and
if the judgment be in favor of the intervening creditor, he shall recover of the
plaintiff and his sureties the costs of suit, and the attachment shall be dissolved.
176 (2472). Proceedings before justice of the peace. —Justices of the peace
shall have cognizance of attachments in all cases where the amount in controversy
is within their jurisdiction ; and in such case the notice to a defendant not found
shall require the appearance of the defendant at some reasonable time, to be fixed
by the justice, not less than one month after the return-day of the attachment,
and shall be transmitted by such justice by mail to the defendant, at his post-office,
when stated; and such notice shall not be published in a newspaper, but shall be
posted in three public places, where they will be likely to be seen by persons in the
district of the justice of the peace, three weeks before the time for the appearance
of the defendant; and such mailing and posting, or posting alone when the postoffice is not stated, shall be in lieu of publication in a newspaper in attachments
before a justice of the peace, and shall authorize such further proceedings as are
provided for in other cases of publication.
177 (2474). Trial before justices of the peace. —On the return of an attach
ment before a justice of the peace, the defendant may file an affidavit, or plea sworn
to, traversing the grounds on which the attachment was sued out, and the justice
shall hear all the evidence adduced by either party, as to whether said attachment
was wrongfully sued out or not; and, if the same was wrongfully sued out, he shall
dismiss the attachment, with costs, and shall give judgment against the plaintiff for
such damages as the defendant may have sustained by the wrongful suing out of
said attachment, and shall proceed to hear the case on the merits.

CHAPTER 10.

178 (251.) To attend the supreme court, etc. —The attorney-general shall
attend the supreme court, and prosecute and defend therein all causes to which

to which any county may be a party, unless the interest of the county be adverse
to the state or some officer thereof acting in his official capacity, or to some other

CHAPTER 12.
ATTORNEYS AND COUNSELLORS AT LAW.
202 (2396). How licensed; preliminary proceedings.—Any person, being a
citizen of the United States, a resident of this state, above the age of twenty-one
years, and of good moral character, who shall desire to be admitted to practice as
an attorney and counsellor at law, may make application, in writing, to the chan
cery court of the county of his residence, making known his wish. The court
shall thereupon inquire into the moral character and qualifications, other than legal
learning, of the applicant, and to that end may examine witnesses; and if the
applicant be found possessed of all the necessary qualifications except legal learning,
the court shall so adjudge, and enter an order on the minutes to that effect; but if
the applicant be found not to be so qualified, his application shall be dismissed at
his costs.
203. How legal learning of applicant determined. —The applicant being
found to be otherwise qualified, the chancellor, in open court, shall propound, in
writing, to said applicant, a sufficient number of questions to thoroughly test his
learning upon the following subjects, viz. :
(1) Of the law of real property ;

law in this state, under the same restrictions and regulations that attorneys and
counsellors, resident in this state, are permitted to practice in such coterminous

judge of the supreme court, or a judge of a circuit court, or a chancellor to exer
cise the profession or employment of an attorney or counsellor at law, or to be
engaged in the practice of law; and any person offending against this prohibition
shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor, and be removed from office ; but this shall not
prohibit a chancellor from practicing in any of the courts so far as to enable him to
bring to a conclusion cases actually pending when he was appointed chancellor, in
which he was then employed; nor shall it hinder a circuit judge from concluding
cases pending in the supreme or chancery courts or in the courts of the United

any appeal from the judgment of such officer, or in any certiorari to such officer, he

hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both.
216 (2404). Penalty for misconduct. —If any attorney or counsellor at law be

or shall willfully violate his duties, he shall be stricken from the roll and disbarred,
and his license revoked, by any court in which he may practice; and such person
shall never afterward be permitted to act as an attorney or counsellor in any court
in this state.
An attorney was disbarred, on motion made therein, by the high court of errors and appeals for miscon
duct in case3 pending in a circuit court. Ex parte Brown, 1 How. (Miss.), 303.
217 (1545). Attorney to state residence of plaintiff. —Any attorney whose
name is subscribed to or indorsed on any declaration or bill or petition in chancery,

or privity, and also the place of abode of the plaintiff; and if such attorney shall

shall be taken in the action without leave of the court.
218 (2405). Proceedings for money collected.—Every attorney or counsellor
at law receiving money for his client, and failing or refusing to pay the same when
demanded, may be proceeded against in a summary way, by motion before the cir
cuit court of the county where such attorney or counsellor usually resides, or where
he may be found, or before the court in which the money was collected, in the same
manner that sheriffs are liable to be proceeded against for money collected on exe
cution, five days' notice of such motion being given ; and, in addition to the prin
cipal and legal interest, damages at ten per centum on the amount thereof shall be
awarded; and in case the failure to pay over said money shall appear to have been
willful and without reasonable excuse, the court shall fine and imprison such attor
ney or counsellor as for a contempt, and strike his name from the roll and revoke his
license, or may suspend his right to practice until the money shall be paid over.
The statute gives the remedy, by motion, only where the attorney fails or refuses to pay over money
actually collected. The statute must be strictly construed. Lombard v. Whiting, Walker, 229; Banks v.
Cage, 1 How. (Miss.), 293; Sloan v. Johnson, 14 Smed. & M., 47.
Notice must be given the attorney. Ex parte Heyfron, 7 How. (Miss.), 127.
Only the client can make the motion. Sloan v. Johnson, 13 Smed. & M., 47; McCreary v, Iloopes, 25
Miss., 428.
It is no defense to the motion that the attorney has been notified by others, claiming the fund, not to
pay; and the attorney's right of setoff is good only to the extent of his lien for his fees in that particular
case. Dunn v. Vannerson, 7 How. (Miss.), 579.
A decision in an attorney's favor because the motion was an improper remedy, does not bar a suit against
him on the same case. Coopwood v. Baldwin, 25 Miss., 129.

finally. Bank v. Duncan, 52 Miss., 740; Georgia K. R. Co. v. Brooks, 66 Miss , 5JC; Evrich v. Bank 6T
Miss., 60.
As a matter of necessity, in order to ascertain the boundaries of the jurisdiction of the courts, reference

person, to alter the name of such person, to make legitimate any of his offspring

county in which a minor resides may re-move the disability of his minority.

writing by the minor, by his next friend, and it shall state the age of such minor
and the names and place of. residence of his parents, and, if he has no parent, the

kindred within the prescribed degree whose place of residence is known to him or
his next friend, or if all such kindred known to him or his co-petitioners shall unite

be sworn to; and where the names ami places of residence of persons in interest are
given, they shall be made parties defendant ; and where the bill shall show that the

title existing at the time of the sale for taxes; and such decree shall vest in the
complainant, without any conveyance by a master or commissioner, a good and

clouds therefrom, the complainant must set forth in plain and concise language the
deraignment of his title; and a mere statement therein that complainant is the real
owner of the land shall be insufficient, unless good and valid reason be given why
he does not deraign his title; and in all such cases final decrees in the complainant's
favor shall be recorded in the record of deeds, and shall be indexed as if a convey

plainant or complainants, if more than one.

and other clouds upon title, and to confirm title to real estate, the chancery court
shall have jurisdiction to decree possession and to displace possession, to decree
rents and compensation for improvements and taxes; and in all cases where said
court heretofore 'exercised jurisdiction auxiliary to courts of common law, it ma}'
exercise such jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, although the legal remedy may
not have been exhausted or the legal title established by a suit at law.
503 (1843, 1844, 1845). Creditors may attack fraudulent conveyances, etc.—

CHANCERY COURTS.

unsatisfied, to set aside fraudulent conveyances of property, or other devices resorted
to tor the purpose of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors; and may subject
the property to the satisfaction of the demands of such creditors as if complainants
had judgments and executions thereon returned "no property found." Upon such
a bill a writ of sequestration or injunction, or both, may be issued, upon like terms
and conditions as such writs may be issued in other cases, and subject to such pro
ceedings and provisions thereafter as are applicable in other cases of such writs.
The creditor in such case shall have a lien upon the property described therein from
the filing of his bill, except as against bona fide purchasers before the service of
process upon the defendant in such bill.
The federal courts refuse to enforce this section. Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S., 106.
The object of the statute is to prevent the necessity of a creditor resorting first to a court of law to
recover a judgment, and then going into equity to secure its satisfaction; there is no reason why th» court,
having jurisdiction under the statute, should stop short of giving the parties all the relief which their case
requires. Insurance Co. v. Ligon, 59 Miss., 305.
A cross-bill may be predicated on this statute. Heirmau v. Stricklin, 60 Miss.. "2IU.
A writ of seizure in favor of the vendor of personal properly, cannot be enforced against property in
the hands of an assignee or receiver appointed in a suit under the statute. Frank v. Hobinson, 65 Miss., 162.
A bill filed under the statute need not show that the defendant debtor is insolvent, nor that complainant
cannot obtain satisfaction of his demand without resorting to the property in suit. Bank v. Buddig, 65
Miss., 2S4.
504 (1834). May determine all matters in estates administered.—The court
in which a will may have been admitted to probate, letters of administration granted,
or a guardian may have been appointed, shall have jurisdiction to hear and deter
mine all questions in relation to the execution of the trust of the executor, admin
istrator, guardian, or other officer appointed for the administration and management
of the estate, and of all demands against it by heirs at law, distributees, devisees,
legatees, wards, creditors, or others ; and shall have jurisdiction of all cases in which
bonds or other obligations shall have been executed in any proceeding in relation to
the estate, or other proceedings, had in said chancery court, to hear and determine
upon proper proceedings and evidence, the liability of the obligors in such bond or
obligation, whether as principal or surety, and by decree and process to enforce
such liability.
The statute enables a judgment creditor of an estate to sue in equity. Whitfield v. Evans, 56 Miss., 488;
Cloptou v. Haughton, 57 Miss., 787.
Ex contractu creditors may sue in chancery without judgments. (Seemingly orerruling Bernheimer v
Calhoun, 44 Miss., 426.) Hunt v. Potter, 58 Miss., 96; Brastield v. French, 59 Miss., 6;i2.
The statute is constitutional. ( Overruling Smith v. Everett, 50 Miss., 575. ) Bank v. Duncan, 52 Miss.,
740; Brunini v. I'era, 54 Miss., 649.
Executors de son tort of a deceased surety on the bond of an administrator may be sued in equity with
the principal thereon. Buie v. Pollock, 55 Miss., 309.
The statute applies in favor of distributees, even after a formal settlement bv the administrator Brunini
v. Pera. 54 Miss., 649.
The chancery court in which a guardian is subsequently appointed has jurisdiction to ascertain proper
compensation to those entitled thereto from the ward's estate. Epperson v. Nugent, 57 Miss , 45.
The chancery court in which a will is probated has jurisdiction to decree the sale of lands, at the suit of
the legatee, though the land lie and all defendants reside out of the county. Turner v. Turner, 57 Miss., 775.
The statute does not authorize a suit by an administrator against a person who bid off the same for the
price of goods sold by the administrator under decree directing the sale to be for cash. Pate v. Tavlor 66
Miss., 97.
'
505. Concurrent jurisdiction.—And the chancery court shall have jurisdiction,
concurrent with the circuit court, of suits on bonds of fiduciaries and public officers
for failure to account for money or property received or wasted or lost by neglect or
failure to collect, and of suits involving inquiry into matters of mutual accounts.

witness, whose appearance in court may be deemed necessary for any purpose,
whether such party or witness reside in the same or any other county; and it shall
be the duty of the party summoned or subpoenaed, to attend the court according
to the command of the process; and if it be necessary or proper to enforce the
appearance of the party, the court, on the return of process executed and failure to
appear, may issue an attachment, and may fine the party when brought in, for a con
tempt. If a witness before the court shall refuse to testify, the court may commit
such witness for contempt of court.
507 (1836). Issue may be tried by a jury.—The chancery court, in a contro

of the circuit court, who shall attend with the box for that purpose. The number
drawn shall not exceed twenty, and the slips containing the names shall be returned
to the box. The clerk of the chancery court shall issue the venire facias to the
sheriff, returnable as the court shall direct. If there be no jury-box, the jury may
be obtained as provided for in the circuit court in such case. The sheriff and jurors,
for failure to perform duty or to attend, shall be liable to like penalty as in the
circuit court. The parties shall have the same right of challenge as in trials in the
circuit court, and the jury may be completed in the same manner. The chancellor
may instruct the jury in the same way that juries are instructed in the circuit court,
and the parties shall have the same rights in respect thereto; the instruction shall
be filed in the cause and become a part of the record, and the chancellor shall sign
bills of exceptions as in the circuit court, and the court may grant new trials in
proper cases. (See §§ 732, 733, 735, 736, 737, and 738.)
508 (1837). Change of venue in jury cases allowed, etc. —The chancery court,

the application for a change of venue, and the order for it, in term-time or vacation,
shall be as required in such case in the circuit court. And the clerk of the court from
which the issue is to be removed, and the clerk of the court to which it is removed,
respectively, shall, upon an order for a change of venue, discharge the duties directed
to be performed by the clerks of circuit courts in such cases ; and in such case
the chancery court to which the venue is changed shall try the issue by a jury, and

of administration were granted, or the guardian was appointed ; other suits respecting
real or personal property may be brought in the chancery court of the county in

provided may be brought in the chancery court of any count}' where the defendant,
or any necessary party defendant, may reside or be found; and in all cases process
may issue to any county to bring in defendants and to enforce all orders and decrees
of the court. (For venue in partition suits, see § 3097.)
A bill by a judgment-debtor seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment, and to recover from the
sheriff the possession of the property levied on, is a suit respecting real or personal property, and ma}" be
filed in the county where the property is. Boswell v. Wheat, 37 Miss., 610.
A purchaser of land situated in another state can maintain a bill in the chancery court of the county of
this state where his vendor resides, to enforce the warranty of title and obtain re-imbursemeut for expendi
tures in resisting ft suit and extinguishing » paramount title. Oliver v. Loye, 59 Miss., 320.

511 (1854). The writ of sequestration. — When a bill is filed in the chancery
court in reference to personal property, and affidavit and bond as retired therefor is

shall issue, the complainant shall make and tile an affidavit showing that he has
good cause to believe, and does believe, that there is danger of the removal of the
property involved in the suit beyond the limits of the state, or of its concealment
in the state so as to be beyond the process of the court, or of its transfer so as to
defeat the rights of the complainant, and that such removal, concealment, or transfer
is about to occur, and, moreover, shall give the bond required by the next section.
513 (1854). The same; bond required of complainant.—Before the writ of
sequestration shall issue in any case, the complainant shall enter into bond with
sufficient sureties, payable to the defendant, in double the value of the property
proposed to be seized, to be fixed by the clerk from affidavit, or such evidence as
may satisfy him, conditioned to pay all damages which may accrue from the wrong
ful seizure of the property to be sequestered, which bond shall be filed in the
cause.
514 (1854). The same; what the writ to contain, etc.—The writ of sequestra
tion shall be directed to the sheriff or other proper officer, commanding him to seize
and take into possession the property in question, and to hold the same until" the
further order of the court or chancellor, or until the defendant from whose posses

ditioned to have the property forthcoming to abide the decree to be made by the
226

CHANCERY COURTS.

515-519

court in the cause, which bond the defendant may give, and thereby be restored to
the possession of the property. Said bond, if given, shall be returned with the writ
and filed in the cause, and, in case the property shall not be delivered or forthcom
ing to abide the decree, shall have the force and effect of a judgment; and execution
may issue thereon against all the obligors for the amount of the decree or the valueof the property, according to the nature of the case.
515 (1854). The same; complainant may bond the property in certain cases.
—Should the defendant fail to give bond to retain the property, as above allowed,
within five days from the date of seizure, then the complainant at whose instance the
property was seized, may give such bond and receive the property; which bond
shall be dealt with in all respects as if the defendant had given it and retained the
property.
516 (1854). The same; how property disposed of if not bonded.—If neither
of the parties litigant shall give such bond to retain the property, within ten da}-s
after the seizure, the officer having possession of the property shall sell the same, in
the mode prescribed by law for selling property levied upon under writs of fieri
facias, if the property be liable to waste or decay, or if subject to extraordinary
expense in preserving the same, and hold the proceeds subject to the future orders
of the court; and if the property be not liable to waste or decay, or be not expen
sive to keep, it shall be held by such officer, unless the court or the chancellor shall
order it to be sold, as may be done when it is thought best to do so; and if such
property shall be sold, either by the officer seizing it, in the state of case provided
for when he may sell it, or by order of the court or chancellor, the proceeds of
such sale shall be subject to the, orders of the court or chancellor, as to their safe
keeping or investment, during the litigation. If the property seized be liable to
immediate waste or decay, it shall be sold immediately. If the defendant do not
give bond to retain the property within five days from its seizure, and the complain
ant do not do so within five days after defendant's failure, either party may, before
sale of the property, give the required bond and receive the property, or after sale
may give such bond and receive the proceeds.
Attorney's fees and other expenses incident to the chancery suit are not recoverable in an action on the,
snquestration-bond. Stauffer v. Garrison, 61 Miss., 67.
517 (1854). The same ; the chancellor or any judge may order the writ and
fix amount of bond. —Writs of sequestration may also be ordered, and the amount

lor, or by any judge authorized to grant remedial process of such'nature. (See § 910.)
518 (1858). How unknown persons may be made parties.—When the heirs of

chancery, and the names of all or any such heirs shall be unknown to the complain
ant, such of said persons whose names may be unknown, may be described as the
" unknown heirs" of the deceased; and when the parties in interest are unknown
they may be sued as " unknown parties in interest."
The statute applies whether the unknown defendants are resident or non-resident. Reed v. Gregory, 46
Miss., 740.
519 (1859). When decrees on publication only are final.—Decrees against
non-resident, absent, or unknown defendants, rendered upon proof of publication
227

520-523

CHANCERY COURTS.

only, without such defendant having appeared, shall be final and conclusive from
the date of rendition, unless a rehearing shall be applied for within two years there
after; but if the complainant shall serve a copy of said decree on the defendant
within one year and six months of its rendition, a rehearing shall be applied for
within six months after the date of such service. But decrees for divorce, or for
the sale of property, in the administration of the estates of decedents, or on peti
tions of guardians, or in any other case in which it is so provided by law, are not
included in the provisions of this section for rehearings.
If the facts conform to all the requisites of the statute, a right to a rehearing is thereby conferred. Mc
Allister v. Plant, 49 Miss., 628.
The fact that defendant had full knowledge of the proceedings does not deprive him of the right to a
rehearing Jacks v. Bridewell, 51 Miss., 88 1 .
Decrees confirming tax-titles are within the section as to rehearings. Belcher v. Wilkinson, 54 Miss., 677.
520 (1860). How such rehearing may be obtained.—If a defendant against
whom a decree has been rendered on publication only, at any time before the expi
ration of the time allowed for a rehearing, shall appear and petition the court
therefor, and give security for the costs, such defendant shall be permitted to plead,
demur, or answer to the bill, and to take testimony; and the cause shall be heard
anew on its merits, and such decree be rendered as may be equitable, and the court
may stay all proceedings in the meantime on the original decree; and if it have been
executed, may, on the final hearing, decree restitution; but notice of such petition
must be given to the opposite party, as in other suits; and the title to property sold
to a purchaser, in good faith, in pursuance of a decree, shall not be affected by any
such rehearing.
After the petition for rehearing- is allowed, the suit is a pending one, and the complainant may dismiss
it. Belcher v. Wilkinson, 54 Miss., 677.
521 (1861). Pleadings and practice; application of rules prescribed.—The
rules of pleading and practice herein prescribed shall apply to all cases in matters
in equity in the chancery courts, but the statutes regulating proceedings in matters
testamentary and of administration, in minors' business, and in cases of idiocy,
lunacy, and persons of unsound mind, or any other matter or proceeding in such
courts, shall be the rules of practice and proceeding in such cases; and all the pro
visions of law regulating the decrees of said courts in matters in equity, and
their operation and effect, and the manner of enforcing them, shall apply to all cases
in said courts, unless it be otherwise provided.
522 (1862). Mode of trial.—The mode of trial in chancery courts shall be the
same as heretofore practiced by such courts, except as modified by law.
523 (1863). Answer not required in certain cases.—In proceedings in matters
testamentary and of administration, in minors' business, and in cases of idiocy,
lunacy, and persons of unsound mind, as provided for by law, no answer shall be
required to any petition or application of any sort, and such a petition or applica
tion shall not be taken as confessed because of the want of an answer; but every
petition, application, or account shall be supported by the proper evidence, and may
be contested without an answer. And all such proceedings shall be as summary as
the statutes authorizing and regulating them contemplate; but when either of the
parties having a controversy in court as to any of said several matters shall require,
and the court shall see proper, it may direct plenary proceeding by bill or petition,
228

CHANCERY COURTS.

524-530

to which there shall be an answer, on oath or affirmation ; and if the party refuse
to answer to any matter alleged in the bill or petition, and proper for the court to
decide upon, the party refusing may be attached, fined, and imprisoned at the dis
cretion of the court, and the matters set forth in the bill or petition shall be taken
as confessed, and a decree be made accordingly.
524 (1864). Answer or demurrer may be filed.—Where an answer is not neces
sary in the matters mentioned in the preceding section, any one desiring to contest
any petition or application ma}- file a plea or an answer, or may demur to any
petition, and in that way test its sufficiency.

the party or his solicitor.

follows, to wit : " The complainant [or petitioner] shows to the court," and the
residence of the parties must be stated, following the address, thus : "A B, a citizen
of
, complainant, v. C D and E F, citizens of
, defendants."
If the bill conform to the statute, it is then unnecessary to name the defendants in the prayer for process.
White v. Thorua* 52 Miss., 4'J.
527 (1868). What bill must contain.—The bill must contain a statement of the
facts on which the complainant seeks relief, in ordinary and concise language, with
out repetition or needless prolixity, and conclude with a prayer for relief, without
a charge of combination or confederacy by the defendants, or the insufficiency of
the remedy at law, or other merely formal matter or similar useless averment, but
the bill may contain special interrogatories to the defendant; but it shall not be a
ground of objection to a bill that it contains all the parts of a bill according to the
former practice in chancery pleadings.
A fishing bill is demurrable. Richardson v. Wolf, 31 Miss., 616.
Where some of the allegations of the bill are too vague, a demurrer, limited thereto, should be sustained;
but in such case a demurrer to the whole bill would be overruled. White v. Thomas, 52 Miss., -VX
Complainant, to obviate a demurrer, must aver distinctly and clearly his case. Smith v. Hill, 52 Miss.,
607; Perkins v. Sanders, 56 Miss., 733.

shall be given to the opposite party.
530 (1870). Of demurrers; form of demurrer. —Demurrers may be in the fol
lowing form, after giving the style of the case and its number, to wit:

229

531-536

CUANCERY COURTS.

531 (1871). Certificate necessary.—A demurrer must not only be subscribed
by tbe solicitor interposing it, but must have attached his certificate that he believes
it ought to be sustained.
532 (1872). Demurrer to be set down.—The party demurring must set the
demurrer down on the docket for hearing at once if it be filed in term-time, and at
the next term if it be filed in vacation. If the party do not see that his demurrer
is set for hearing, it shall be overruled of course.
The part}' who files a demurrer in vacation is not allowed the whole of the next term in which to set
down his demurrer for hearing; he must do so promptly. Memphis R. R. Co v. Owens, 60 Miss., 227.
533 (1873, 1892). Of answers; answer must be full; charges of bill not
denied true.—The defendant shall answer fully all the allegations of the bill with
out being specially interrogated. All matters of fact averred in the bill and not
denied by the answer otherwise than by the general traverse, may be taken at the
hearing as admitted.
If facts be stated to be in defendant's knowledge, he must answer positively; as to facts not within his
knowledge, he must answer as to his information and belief, and not as to information only. McAllister v.
Clopton, 51 Miss., 257.
Facts within the personal knowledge of the defendant must be explicitly admitted or denied ; and if not
within his knowledge, he must deny all knowledge and information. ( Overruling Cowan v. Alsop, 51 Miss.,
159.) Mead v. Day, 54 Miss., 58.
An answer may refer to another answer in same court denying the averments of the bill, and, in the
absence of exception, is not to be taken as an admission of the averments of the bill. Davis v. Lumpkin,
57 Miss., 506.
The answer of one defendant will inure to the benefit of another. Salmon v. Smith, 58 Miss., 399'.
Where the answer fails to traverse a charge in the bill, evidence will not be considered which denies it.
Colbert v. Henley, 64 Miss., 374.
A denial in an answer upon information is sufficient to prevent the facts averred from being taken asadmitted. Carpenter v. Edwards, 64 Miss., 595.
534 (1874). Answer under oath unless waived in bill; answer of a corpo
ration. —The answer shall be sworn to by the defendant unless the complainant in
his bill shall waive an answer under oath; in which case the answer, whether
sworn to or not, shall not be evidence for the respondent. The answer of a corpo
ration need not be under its seal, but shall be sworn to by its president, general
manager, or superintendent or other general officer, unless an answer under oath
shall likewise be waived.
535 (1949). Rule requiring two witnesses modified. —The rule requiring two
witnesses, or one witness and corroborating circumstances, to overthrow an answer
denying the allegations of the bill, is abolished in all cases where the bill is sworn
to by the complainant; and such an answer shall have only such weight and credit
as in view of the interest of the party making the same, and the other circum
stances of the case, it may be fairly entitled to.
A bill sworn to by the solicitor of the complainant is not within the statute. Jacks v. Bridewell, 51
Miss., 881 ; Waller v. Shannon, 53 Miss., 500.
The rule requiring two witnesses, etc.. applies only when the denial is positive, and does not apply when
on belief or as matter of inference or argument. Toulme v. Clark, 64 Miss., 471.
Nor does it apply where a sworn answer to an unsworn bill, is on information and belief merely. Snell
v. Fewell, 64 Miss., 655.
536 (1875). Answer may he made a cross-bill.—A defendant in a chancery
suit may make his answer a cross-bill against the complainant, or his co-defendant
or defendants, or all of them; and may introduce any new matter therein mate
rial to his defense, and may require the same to be answered ; and in the same
230

CHANCERY COURTS.

537-541

manner may require of the complainant, or any of the defendants, a discovery of
any matter material to his defense, and he shall have process thereon against the
defendants to such cross-bill, and the like proceedings thereon as in other bills or
cross-bills ; but live days' notice, in writing, to the solicitor of the complainant in the
original bill shall be sufficient to require the complainant to appear to such cross
bill, and to answer the same within said time, unless the court, or chancellor in
vacation, for cause shown, extend the time for answering. (See § 121.)
Relief cannot be granted a defendant except upon a cross-bill filed by him. Arnold v. Miller, 26 Miss.i
152; Millsaps v. Pfeifer, 44 Miss., 805.
Persons not parties to the original bill cannot be made parties to a cross-bill. Ladner v. Ogden, 31 Miss.,
332 ; Bishop v. Miller, 48 Miss., 364; Wright v. Frank, 61 Miss., 32. (For an exception to this rule, see §121-)
Relief cannot be granted on a cross-bill which is purely legal ; and new and distinct matters, not embraced
in the original bill, cannot be made the foundation for relief on the cross-bill. Gilmer v. Felhour, 45 Miss.,
627; Wright v. Frank, 61 Miss , 32.
As against the complainant in the original bill, the cross-bill need not show equity to support the juris
diction of the court. Thomason v. Neely, 50 Miss., 310.
The dismissal of the original bill, as a rule, carries with it the cross-bill; but to this there are exceptions.
Gilmer v. Felhour, 45 Miss., 627; Jacks v. Bridewell, 51 Miss., 881; Thomason v. Neely, 50 Miss., 310; Bel
cher v. Wilkinson, 54 Miss., 677; Dewees v. Dewees, 55 Miss., 315.
The time within which a cross-bill may be filed rests within the discretion of the court. Burford v. Ker
sey, 48 Miss., 642.
A cross-bill will not stay the proceedings in the original cause, except by order of court. Griswold v.
Simmons, 50 Miss., 137.
If the cross-bill be taken as confessed it will have the same effect as if the complainant had admitted
the same facts in the answer. Griswold v. Simmons, 50 Miss., 137.
Unless the cross-bill presents ground for relief, it is nothing more than an answer, and is demurrable.
Buckingham v. Wesson, 54 Miss., 526.
A cross-bill may be predicated upon separate and independent matter if it grow out of the same subjectmatter involved in the original bill. Dewees v. Dewees, 55 Miss., 315.
537 (1876). Proceedings to compel an answer; defendant attached.—When
a defendant shall fail to answer within the time required by law, the complainant,
instead of taking a decree pro confesso, may obtain from the chancellor an order
for an attachment, returnable in term-time, to compel such defendant to answer;
but affidavit must be first made and filed in the cause, by the complainant or his
solicitor, that such answer is necessary for the ends of justice, as he believes.

for this state, or any judge, chancellor, or any justice of the peace, notary public,
or the mayor or alderman of any city or town, or clerk of a court of record, in the
state or country where such defendant may be, if such officer shall be authorized
to administer oaths by the law of such state or country; and the certificate of such
officer as to his official character, shall be .prima facie evidence thereof.
540 (1870). Replication to answer unnecessary.—A replication to an answer
shall not be required, but the cause shall be at issue when the answer is filed.
541 (1880). Plea set down or replied to. —When a plea shall be filed the com
plainant may set it down for argument upon its sufficiency in law, or he may reply
to it.
A bill cannot be taken as confessed while a plea thereto is pending. It is not the duty of the defendant
to set the plea for hearing. Smith v. Cozart, 45 Miss., 698.

CHANCERY COURTS.

542 (1881). Amendments liberally allowed.—Amendments shall be allowed
in the pleadings and proceedings, on liberal terms, to prevent delay and injustice.
Neither an amended nor supplemental bill, proposing to change the frame and essential character of the
original bill, should be allowed. Chirk v. Hull, 31 Miss , 520; Miazza v. Yerger,'53 Miss , 135.
An amendment should not be allowed if it do not charge a material fact not contained in the original.
Richardson v. Wolfe, 31 Miss., 610.
An amendment cannot be made, unless specially authorized by statute, without an order of court Hunt
v. Walker, 40 Miss., 590.
But a refusal to strike out an amendment is equivalent to leave Ward v. Whitfield, 64 Miss., 754.
It is error to dissolve an injunction because of a defective bond, without giving time to amend it. Smith
v. Harrington, 49 Miss., 771.
It is within the discretion of the court to allow a defendant to withdraw an answer and demur. Kimbrough v. Curtis. 50 Miss.. 117.
It is not error to refuse complainant leave to file an amended bill after the cause is set for final hearing,
which proposes to introduce new grounds of relief known to him when he prepared his original bill. Walker
v. Brown, 45 Miss., 615.
Amendments may be allowed after the reversal of the case in the supreme court if the applicant have
not been guilty of negligence. Hanserd v. Gray, 46 Miss., 75.
Even if the cause be set for final hearing it is error to refuse an application to amend the bill so as to
cure a variance between its allegations and the evidence, where the complainant has not been guilty of negli
gence in not asking to amend betore that time. Jeffries v. Jeffries, 66 Miss., 216.
543 (1882). When bill amended without leave. —The complainant may amend
his bill as of course, without applying to the court, at any time before the defend
ant has made defense, upon complainant paying the costs of furnishing a copy of
the amendment to such of the defendants as have taken out copies of the original
bill, and of notice of the amendment to be served on all of the defendants. In
all other cases amendments can be made only by leave of the court, or the chancel
lor in vacation, and upon such terms as the court or chancellor may impose.
544 (1883). Defendant to answer amendment after notice.—When a bill is
amended, after answer filed, and an answer to the amendment is necessary, the
defendant shall be allowed twenty days after notice of the amendment to answer,
failing in which the matter of the amendment may be taken as confessed; and if
the defendant or his solicitor be present in court when an amendment is made, other
notice shall not be required.
It is unnecessary to summon a defendant to answer the amendment, if he be duly summoned to the
original bill, where the amendment does not vary or affect his rights. Albright v. Flowers, 52 Miss., 246.
If the amendment to a bill be material, the defendant should be allowed a reasonable time to answer it.
(One hour and three-quarters held unreasonable in the case.) Davis v. Davis, 62 Miss., HIS.
If, after answer filed, the bill is materially amended, the defendant sh mid be permitted to treat it as a
new bill. Davis v Davis. 62 Miss., 818.
545 (1884). How amendments made.—Amendments of bills and answers shall
be made on paper, distinct from the bill or answer, except where the amendment is
of a brief character, when it may be made by an erasure or interlineation with ink
of a different color from that in which the bill or answer is written ; and the amend
ment shall be made in such a manner that it may be ascertained with certainty in
what it consists.
546 (1885). Bill to make new parties filed in vacation. —A complainant desir
ing to make new parties to his bill may file his amended bill for that purpose in the
clerk's office, in vacation, without leave of the court or chancellor; and thereupon
the clerk shall issue process upon such bill, in like manner as if it were an orig
inal bill.
547 (1886, 1887). Of multifariousness.—If a demurrer for multifariousness
shall be sustained, the court may authorize amendments by directing separate bills

CIIANCKRY COURTS.

548-551

to be tiled without new process as to the parties before the court, and by the addition
of new parties, or otherwise, as may be necessary or proper for the attainment of
justice; but the uniting in oue bill of. several distinct and unconnected matters of
equity against the same defendants shall not be an objection to the bill.
The statute does not permit the uniting in one bill of distinct and unconnected equities against discon
nected defendants; it in no way affects the question as to disconnected parties or subjects. Columbus v.
Humphries. (14 Miss., 258.
Statute applied. Georgia R. R. Co. v. Brooks, 60 Miss., 583.
548 (1888). No objection at hearing for misjoinder. —An objection for mis
joinder of parties taken at the hearing shall not be considered, but the court shall
decree upon the merits without regard to such objection.
549 (1889). When defendant shall plead, answer, or demur, etc. —When the
process shall be returned executed, or proof of publication made, the defendant shall
plead, answer, or demur on or before the first day of the term, if the process be
returnable to a regular term of the court; and if the process require the appearance
of the defendant on a rule-da}' in vacation, the defendant shall plead, answer, or
demur on or before the monthly rule-day next succeeding that to which 6uch pro
cess is returnable; and if the defendant shall fail to plead, answer, or demur at the
time required, the complainant's bill may then, or at any time afterward, before
plea, answer, or demurrer is filed, be taken as confessed against such defendant ; a
pro confesso, so taken, shall not be set aside without good cause shown. If the bill
be taken for confessed against all the defendants, the complainant may set down
the cause for hearing at once.
A cause ought not to be set down for linal hearing before a pro confesso is taken against a defendant who
hiis failed to appear. Beville v. Mcintosh, 41 Miss., 516.
When application is made to set aside it pro confesso the defendant must exhibit his answer, or must
show why he cannot do so, and ask for further time; if he do neither he will not be considered as showing
"good cause." Pittman v. McClellan, 55 Miss., 299; Pattison v.'Josselyn, 43 Miss., 373.
When a pro confesso has been taken through the mere neglect of defendant to answer, nnd the conse
quences of the neglect do not operate injuriously to the complainant, except to deprive him of the advantage
of such a decree, the defendant should not be deprived of making defense. Yost v. Alderson, 68 Miss., 40.
Upon appeal from a decree setting aside a pro confesso, unless the record be shown to contain all the
" showing" made, it will be presumed that the chancellor decided correctly. Bryant v. Rosenbauni, 62 Miss.,
191 ; Peterson v. Kittredge, 65 Miss., 33.
Where process is returnable before the clerk, at rules, the defendant has until the next succeeding ruleday to plead, although a term of court intervene. Jones v. Hervey, 66 Miss., 99.
550 (1890). Additional time to plead, answer, or demur.—Additional time to
plead, answer, or demur may be allowed by the court on cause shown, and when a
plea or demurrer shall be disallowed, the defendant shall answer within such rea
sonable time as the court may require ; but an answer may be required to be filed
duringithe same term, and should be where the plea or demurrer is merely for delay.
When a demurrer is overruled because not set for hearing, it is not improper to require an answer at once.
Memphis R. R. Co v Owens, 00 Miss., 227.
551 (1891). Exceptions to bills or answers. —Exceptions to bills must be taken
before answer filed, and exceptions to answers must be taken at or before the next
term after the answer has been filed. When exceptions shall be taken in vacation
the clerk shall refer the same to a master, who shall report thereon to the next, term
of the court, when the court shall hear and determine the same, if applied to;
otherwise the report of the master shall be adopted. Exceptions taken in termtime shall be set down on the motion-docket by the party excepting, and be dis

552-558

CHANCERY COURTS.

posed of, if possible, during such term. In all cases exceptions shall be taken in
writing and filed in the cause.
552 (1893). When answer to be taken as true. —If the complainant shall set
down the cause for hearing before the expiration of the time allowed for taking
testimony, the answer shall be taken as true.
The date of filing, and not the date of the affidavit to the answer, controls; and if no objection be made
at the hearing that the cause is prematurely set for trial, it will be a waiver. Hart v. Bloomfield. t!6 Miss., 100.
553 (1894). Guardian ad litem. —The court may appoint a guardian ad litem toany infant or defendant of unsound mind, and allow him suitable compensation
payable out of the estate of such party, but the appointment shall not be made
except when the court shall consider it necessary for the protection of the interest
of such defendant ; and a decree or judgment of any court shall not be void or
erroneous because of the failure to have a guardian ad litem.
554 (1947). Note of evidence made on hearing. —On the hearing of each causethe chancellor or clerk shall make a note of the depositions and instruments of
written evidence introduced and read by the parties respectively, showing the order
of their introduction, and by which party ottered; and such note of the evidence
shall be filed with the papers of the cause, and shall be part of the record thereof;
but the want of such note or memorandum shall not affect the rights of any party.
555 (1895). Bills of exceptions. —Either party may tender a bill o.f exceptions
in a chancery court whenever it may be necessary to make any matter a part of
the record in the cause, and the chancellor shall sign the same; and all the provis
ions of law applicable to obtaining bills of exceptions in a circuit court shall apply
to a chancery court. (See
733-737.)
556 (1896). Staying proceedings on bill of review.—When a bill of review
shall be filed, the chancellor, in term-time or in vacation, may direct the proceed
ings on the decree sought to be reviewed to be stayed until further order, requiring
such security for the performance of the decree as he may think reasonable ; but
such stay of proceedings shall not be a matter of right ; and on disposing of the
bill of review, the court may render a decree against the parties to such security
as may be proper.
557 (1903). Injunctions; evidence of complainant's equity required.—An
injunction shall not be granted unless the judge or chancellor shall be satisfied of
the complainant's equity and of the truth of the allegations of the bill, by oath or
other means.
558 (1905). Bond required to stay proceedings at law.—An injunction to stay
proceedings at law shall not be issued until after the party obtaining the fiat for the
same shall enter into bond, payable to the plaintiff at law, in double the amount of
the debt sought to be enjoined, with two or more sufficient sureties, to be approved
of by the judge or chancellor, or by the clerk issuing the injunction, conditioned for
paying all money and costs due or to become due to the plaintiff in the action at
law, and also such costs and damages as shall be awarded against him in case the
injunction shall be dissolved; which bond shall be taken by the clerk issuing the
injunction, and shall be by him filed with the bill. If any clerk shall, in any
case, issue an injunction without having first taken bond as required by law, he shall
forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of five hundred dollars, to be recovered in
234

CHANCERY COURTS.

559-565

an action, and shall, moreover, be liable on his official bond for all damages sus
tained thereby.
559 (1906). Bond when injunction is not to stay proceedings at law.— Where
the injunction shall not be for the stay of proceedings in an action at law for the
recovery of money, or upon a judgment requiring the payment of money, the party
applying for the injunction shall, before the issuance of the same, enter into bond
in like manner, in a sufficient penalty, to be fixed by the judge granting the same,
conditioned for the payment of all damages and costs which may be awarded against
him, or which the opposite party may suffer or sustain by reason of the suing out
of said injunction, in case the same shall be dissolved.
560 (1907). Bonds in particular cases.—If the injunction be to stay a sale
under execution of certain designated property, real or personal, or any proceeding
at law as to certain specified things, and not'to restrain proceedings at law generally,
bond may be given as in the last preceding section; but if the injunction shall be
obtai/ied on the ground of some objection to the judgment or execution, or the
demand of the party enjoined to sustain his claim, and shall not be confined to a
contest of his right to subject to his demand particular property by his proceeding,'
bond shall be given as prescribed in the section next before the last.
561 (1908). Bond to enjoin collection of taxes.—An injunction shall not be
granted to stay the collection of state, county, city, town, or village taxes unless
upon condition that, before its issuance, the party obtaining it shall enter into bond
payable to the state, with two or more sufficient sureties, to be approved as in case
of other injunctions, in a penalty at least equal to double the amount of taxes sought
to be enjoined, conditioned for the prompt payment of the taxes enjoined, and
damages and costs, in case the injunction shall be dissolved.
562 (1909). Bond not required of state, county, etc. —Xeither the state, nor
any county, nor any state officer of this state suing out an injunction in his official
character, shall be required to give bond to obtain an injunction.
563 (1910). Injunction dissolved, unless bill filed by first term.— When an
injunction or other restraining order or process shall be granted in vacation, the
bill or petition on which the same was granted shall be filed forthwith in the court
to which such process shall be returnable; and in default thereof the same may be
docketed, on the application of the defendant thereto, and the injunction or other
order or process dissolved, discharged, or set aside, unless good cause be shown to
the contrary.
564 (1?11). Issuance of injunction a release of errors.—When an injunction
shall be granted to stay the execution of a judgment at law, in whole or in part,
the issuance of such injunction shall operate as a release of al] errors in the judg
ment.
565 (1912). Chancellor may order restoration of personal property levied
on. — When an injunction shall be granted to stay the sale of personal property,
levied on by virtue of an execution, the chancellor may order the property to be
restored to the complainant, on his giving bond to the sheriff, with sufficient sureties,
in double the value of the property, to be assessed by such sheriff, payable to the
plaintiff in the execution, and conditioned for the redelivery of the property to the
sheriff in case the injunction shall be dissolved ; which bond shall be returned by
235

566-569

CHANCERY COURTS.

the sheriff with the execution, and shall have the force and effect of a judgment ;
and in case the property shall not be redelivered to the sheriff within fifteen days
after the dissolution of the injunction, the clerk of the court to which the bond was
returned shall issue execution thereon for the amount of the assessed value of said
property and all costs. But in such case the lien on the property, created by the
judgment or decree and the execution and levy, shall remain in force; and the sher
iff, on a writ of venditioni exponas, or other order of sale, may seize the property
so levied on wherever the same may be found.
566 (1913). Similar proceedings in case of property seized under mortgage,
etc.— When an injunction shall be granted to restrain a sale of personal property
seized under a deed of trust or mortgage with power of 6ale, or in any case in which
the sale of such property may be enjoined, the chancellor may order the property to
be restored to the complainant on his giving bond, with sufficient sureties, to be
approved by the chancellor or such officer as he may designate, in double the
value of the property, payable to the person by whom such property is to be sur
rendered and conditioned for the return of the property to the person surrendering
it, if the injunction shall be dissolved; and such bond shall be filed with the bill on
which the injunction was granted, and shall have the force and effect of a decree
against the obligors for the amount thereof; and, if not discharged by the delivery,
within fifteen days after the dissolution of the injunction, of the property to the
person in whose possession it was before said order for restoration to the complain
ant, execution shall be issued on such bond by the clerk for the value of said prop
erty.
567 (1914). Motions to dissolve injunctions. —Motions to dissolve injunctions
may be heard by the chancellor in vacation, on five days' written notice to the
opposite party, accompanied with a copy of the motion ; and if the motion be made
upon the answer of the defendant, a copy of such answer and the' exhibits filed
therewith, shall be served with the notice and copy of motion. In term-time,
motions to dissolve on bill and auswer may be heard five days after answer filed,
on three days' notice to the opposite party, in writing, or by entering the motion
on the docket for the like space of time.
Service of the notice on the complainants' solicitor is as valid as if on the complainant. Such notice is not
vitiated by a misdescription of the client, if there be no mistaking the cause to which it relates. The motion
may be heard by the chancellor in any county of his district Hiller v. Gotten, 54 Miss., 551.
The law does not authorize the hearing of the motion by the chancellor out of his district. Adams v.
Kyzer, 61 Miss., 407.
The complainant cannot object to the hearing of the motion on the statutory number of days after the
filing of the answer, as too early, if the law be complied with in other respects. Carraway v. Odeneal, 06
Miss., 223.
568 (1915). Effect of exception to answer on motion to dissolve.—A motion
to dissolve an injunction upon bill and answer shall not be entertained pending
exceptions to the answer for insufficiency, unless the chancellor be of opinion that
the matters of exception would not affect the motion, even if they be well taken.
The motion to dissolve must be entertained, unless the chancellor be of opinion that the exceptions are *
well taken and affect the merits of the motion; to determine this, he must examine the bill, the answer, and
the exceptions. O'Connor v. Starke, 59 Miss., 481.
569 (1916). Affidavits read in evidence. —Either party may, on the hearing of
a motion to dissolve an injunction on bill and answer, read in evidence affidavits
236

CHANCERY COURTS.

570-573

taken by him, on two days' notice to the opposite party, of the time and place of
taking such affidavits.
570 (1917). Effect of dissolution of injunction on the bill.—When, on
motion, an injunction shall be wholly dissolved, the bill of complaint shall be dis
missed of course, with costs, unless sufficient cause be shown against its dismission
at the next succeeding term of the court.
An order dissolving an injunction, on motion for that purpose, does not of itself dismiss the bill. Pickle
v. Holland, 24 Miss., 56G.
On mere motion to dissolve, on bill and answer, it is error, on sustaining the motion, to dismiss the bill at
once. Draoe v. Winter. 41 Miss., 517; Guion v. Pickett, 42 Miss., 77; Maury v. Smith, 46 Miss., 81 ; Strong
v. Harrison, 62 Miss., 61.
The object of the siatute is to give the complainant an opportunity to amend or to take further proof;
but where the case is disposed of on its merits, both sides having taken their proofs, the case can be dismissed
at once. Bass v. Nelms, 56 .Miss., 502.
571 (1920). Certain injunction-bond to operate as a judgment. —A bond to
enjoin proceeding at law on a judgment for money, upon the dissolution of the
injunction, in whole or in part, shall have the force and effect of a judgment against
the obligors; and being certified by the clerk of the court in which it is filed to the
clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered, execution may be issued
against the obligors for the amount of the judgment which was enjoined.
572 (1918). Damages on dissolution of certain injunctions.—When an injunc
tion, obtained to stay proceedings on a judgment at law for money, shall be dis
solved, in whole or in part, damages at the rate of five per centum shall be added
to the judgment enjoined, or to so much thereof as shall be found due, including
the costs; and the clerk of the chancery court shall certify such dissolution to the
clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered, who shall thereupon issue
execution for the damages, as well as for the original debt and costs. Damages at
the same rate shall be allowed upon the dissolution of injunctions to stay sales
under deeds of trust, or mortgages with power of sale; and such damages may be
added to the debt, and collected by the sale of the property, or execution may issue
from the chancery court for the same, together with the costs of suit, unless the
value of the property the sale of which was restrained, be less than the amount of
the debt, in which case the damages shall be computed on the value of the property,
to be ascertained and determined by the chancellor; and in all cases upon the dis
solution of an injunction the damages may be ascertained by the court or chancel
lor, or upon reference to a master, and proof, if necessary, and decree therefor be
made, 'and execution be issued thereon.
Attornpy's fees and cost of the transcript of papers used on the trial are recoverable. Baggett v. Beard,
43,Miss., 120.
573 (1919). Suggestion of damages and decree therefor.— Where the party
claiming damages shall desire, upon the dissolution of an injunction, to have the
same ascertained and decreed by the chancellor or the chancery court, he shall sug
gest in writing, on the hearing of the motion to dissolve the injunction, the nature
and amount of the damages; and the chancellor or court shall hear evidence, if
necessary, and assess the damages, and decree the same to the party entitled thereto,
for which execution may be issued, as in other cases, against the obligors in the
bond given for the injunction. And if the chancellor, instead of hearing evidence
as to said damages—which may be by witnesses examined before him in vacation or
237

574-578

CHANCERY COURTS.

in term-time, or by deposition, according to the circumstances—shall see proper, he
may make a reference to a master to take testimony and report in such matter; but
nothing herein contained shall prevent the party entitled from maintaining a suit
on the injunction-bond, if his damages shall not be assessed as herein provided for.
A decree dissolving an injunction and awarding damages is interlocutory. Wilson v. Pugh, 61 Miss., 449.
The section does not authorize an independent suit on the bond before final decree. Goodbar v. Dunn,
61 Miss., 624.
If proof of damajres claimed under the statute be insufficient, it is not error to disallow the claim without
prejudice to a suit on the bond. Davis v. Hart, 66 Miss., 642.
574 (1921). Receivers; not appointed without notice, unless, etc.—A receiver
shall not be appointed without the party praying the appointment have given the
opposite part}' at least five days' notice of the time and place of making the appli
cation, and one additional day for every thirty miles of travel thereto, unless it
shall appear that an immediate appointment is necessary, or good cause be shown
for not giving notice.
575. Complainant to give bond before receiver appointed without, notice. —
Before any receiver shall be appointed without notice, the party applying for
the appointment shall execute bond, payable to the adverse party, in a sufficient
penalty, to be fixed by the court or chancellor, with sufficient sureties, conditioned
to pay all damages that may he sustained by the appointment of such receiver in
case the appointment be revoked; and said bond shall he filed in the cause, and
damages may be recovered thereon in the suit in the same manner as damages are
recoverable on an injunction-bond, or the party entitled to damages may maintain
an independent suit on such bond therefor.
576. Receivers may be appointed or removed in vacation.— Receivers may
be appointed by the chancellor in vacation, as well as by the chancery court in termtime; and any receiver may be removed b}- the chancellor in vacation, as well as
by the chancery court in term-time; but before any receiver shall be so removed in
vacation, the party applying therefor must give the adverse party, or his solicitor,
and the receiver five days' notice of the time and place of presenting such applica
tion ; such applications may be heard in term-time on two days' notice.
577 (1024). Receivers subject to orders of court, and may apply therefor in
vacation.—Receivers shall be subject to the orders, instructions, and decrees of the
court, and of the chancellor in vacation; and they, or any party in interest, may
apply therefor in term-time, or to the chancellor in vacation, or for modifications of
previous orders or instructions; and obedience thereto may be enforced by •attach
ment.
578. Bond in lieu of receiver.—On an application for the appointment of a
receiver, the court or chancellor may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, in lieu
of a receiver, order that the party against whom the receiver is asked execute bond,
to be approved by the court or chancellor, payable to the party who asks for the
appointment, with sufficient sureties, in a sufficient penalty, to be fixed by the court
or chancellor, conditioned according to the nature of the case, as the court or chan
cellor may direct. Upon the execution, approval, and filing of such bond, the
receiver shall not be appointed; and any decree rendered in the cause on final
hearing against the principal obligor in the bond shall be rendered against the sure
ties therein, within the scope of its conditions and penaltv. On an application to
238

CHANCERY COURTS.

579-585

remove a receiver who shall have been appointed without notice, the court or chan
cellor may exercise the same discretion, and, in lieu of retaining the receiver, may
remove him upon the execution, approval, and filing of such bond ; and decree may
be rendered thereon as if given on the application for the appointment of a receiver.
579 (1922). Bond of receiver. —Every receiver, when appointed, shall, before
being authorized to act as such, give bond, payable to the state, in such penalty and
with such sureties as may be approved by the court or chancellor, conditioned that
he will in all things faithfully discharge the duties of his office as receiver; which
bond shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and may be put in suit, in the name
of the state, for the use of the party aggrieved, from time to time, until the whole
penalty shall be recovered.
580 (1925). Receiver of money paid into court.—When money shall be paid
into court under its order, a receiver may be appointed to keep the same, who shall
give bond and security as in other cases; but if the money shall be ordered to be
paid to the clerk of such court, his official bond shall cover it, and an additional
bond may be required if the court or chancellor shall think proper.
581 (1926). Receiver of estate of decedent, minor, etc. —In all cases in which
it may be thought to be necessary for the protection of the estate of decedents,
minors, and persons of unsound mind, a receiver may be appointed, either by the
court or by the chancellor in vacation, subject to the foregoing provisions.
582 (1923). Compensation of receiver. —Receivers shall be entitled to have
such compensation for their services as the court shall allow, and shall have a
lien upon the property in their hands for the payment thereof, and of their nec
essary expenses. The court shall make such order to compel the payment thereof
as may be just and necessary, and may decree the payment thereof by any of the
parties as a portion of the costs of the suit.
583 (1897). New bond required in certain cases.—When it shall be alleged
that the security on an injunction or receiver's bond, or any bond taken upon any
proceeding in the chancery court, is insufficient, the chancellor shall have power to
hear and determine the same in vacation, as well as in term-time, and may order
the injunction to be dissolved, or the receiver to be suspended or removed, or may
make such other order as may be just and equitable in the case, unless a new bond
with sufficient sureties be given within twenty days, or such time as he shall appoint ;
but if done in vacation, at least five days' notice of the time and place of making
the application shall be given to the opposite party.
An injunction ought not to be dissolved becnu.se of an insufficient bond, without allowing time for the
execution of an amended or new one. New v. Wright, 44 Miss., 202; Smith v. Harrington, 49 Miss., 771.
584 (1927). Masters in chancery.—The court may appoint two or more persons
in each county to be masters of the court, who shall remain in office during the
pleasure of the chancellor, and who shall receive a reasonable compensation for
services rendered by them, as fixed by law, or allowed by the court, and taxed in
the costs, and collected in the same manner as the fees of the clerk. The clerk
shall issue to such persons a certificate of their appointment.
585 (1928). Special commissioners.—The court may also appoint a special
commissioner in any particular case.

CHANCERY COURTS.

586 (1929): Powers of masters- —The masters in chancery shall have power to
administer oaths ; to take the examination of witnesses in cases pending in any
court; to examine and report upon all matters referred to them; to execute all
decrees directed to them to be executed; and all the powers properly belonging to

mit the same for decision to the chancellor in vacation.
Notice to the parties in interest of the time and plitce of taking the account should be t'ven, except

Felder v. Wall, 26 Miss., 595; Cobb v. Duke, 36 Miss., 60; Chapman v. Evans, 44 Miss., 113; Gaines v.
Coney, 51 Miss., 323.

592 (1935). Decree for balance after sale of property.—Upon the confirmation
of the report of the sale of any property, real or personal, under a decree for sale
to satisfy a mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien on such property, if there be a
balance due to the complainant the court, upon motion, shall give a decree against
the defendant for any such balance for which by the record of the case he may be
personally liable, upon which decree execution may issue.
The right to move for a personal decree is not confined to the term at which the sale is confirmed, but
may be exercised at any time before the decree becomes barred. Notice is unnecessary if the motion be
made at the time of confirmation, but if made at a subsequent term it is necessary. Such decree may be
obtained against the personal representative of a deceased debtor. Weir v. Field, 67 Miss., 292.
593 (1952). Chancellor may sign decrees in vacation.—When a cause has
been taken under advisement at a term of the court by the chancellor, or when a
cause or matter has been tried or heard in vacation by a chancellor, he may sign the
decree in such case or matter in vacation, as well as in term-time, and it shall be
entered on the minute-book of the chancery court in which such cause or matter
is pending, and shall have the same force and effect as if entered in term-time.
594 (1953). Decree to operate as judgment of circuit court.—The decree of a
court of chancery shall have the force, operation, and effect of a judgment at law
in the circuit court.
595 (1954). Decree to operate as a conveyance.—When a decree shall be made
for a conveyance, release, or acquittance, or other writing, and the party against
whom the decree is made shall not comply therewith, then such decree shall be con

effect, and shall be as available, as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance, or
other writing had been executed, iu conformity to the decree; or the court may
appoint a commissioner to execute such writing, which shall have the same effect as
if executed by the party.
596 (1955). Rights of infants saved.—When a decree shall be made for the
sale or conveyance of the real estate of an infant, such decree shall be binding on
the infant unless he shall, within one year after attaining the age of twenty-one
years, show to the court good cause to the contrary; and it shall not be necessary
to insert the saving in the decree, but the saving shall not extend to decrees for the
Bale of the property of deceased persons, authorizing sales by guardians, or enforc
ing deeds of trust or mortgages.
An infant may by an original bill impeach a decree against him. Sledge v. Boone, 57 Miss., 222; Enochs
v. Harrelson, 57 Miss., 465.
A party, within the year after his arriving at majority, may attack a decree rendered against him during
infancy by averring matter aliunde the record. After the expiration of the year he stands on the same ground
as if he had been adult when the decree was entered. Mayo v. Clancy, 57 Miss., 674.
If the infant wish to interpose a new defense, he must, in general, wait until he have become adult; but
for special circumstances shown1 may obtain leave to make new defense during infancy; if the desire be to
impeach the decree for fraud, collusion, or error, he may proceed by original bill during minority. McLemore
v. Chicago R. R. Co., 58 Miss., 514.
An absolute title cannot be acquired under a decree against an infant until the expiration of the year
after his majority. The purchaser of the property should be made a party to the proceeding to vacate the
decree. McLemore v. Chicago R. R. Co., 58 Miss., 514.
The affirmance of the decree by the supreme court will not bar the application for a rehearing; and this is
true though the infant prosecuted the appeal. Vaughn v. Hudson, 59 Miss., 421.
A decree rendered in an infant's favor on a bill filed in his name by a next friend, cannot, in the absence
of fraud, be re-opened by the infant. Johns v. Harper, 61 Miss., 142.
597 (1956). Sheriff to execute decrees; clerk to issue process.—Decrees,
where a master or special commissioner is not appointed to execute them, shall be
241

CHANCERY COURTS.

executed by the sheriff; aud the clerk shall issue all writs of fieri facias, habere
facias possessionem, or other final process, according to the nature of the case,
directed to the sheriff, and returnable to the next term of the court or at such other
time as in a given case may be prescribed.
The statute embraces, and authorizes the issuance of, a writ of assistance. Griswold v. Simmons, 50
Miss , 123; Jones v. Hooper, 50 Miss., 510.
598 (1957). Fieri facias or garnishment on decrees for money. —Whenever
the court shall render an order, judgment, or decree for the payment of money
agiiinst any executor, administrator, or guardian, or any other party litigant therein,
a compliance with such order, judgment, or decree may be enforced by process of
fieri facias or garnishment. (See §§ 2130, 2151.)
599 (1959). Of sales under decrees.—Every sale of real estate ordered by a
decree of any court of chancery shall be made for cash, unless otherwise ordered
by the court, and at such place and on such notice as may be directed in the decree ;
and if direction be not given, at such place and on such notice as is required in case
of sales of land under execution at law. The person making the sale, if made on
credit, shall take bond, with sufficient security, in double the amount of the pur
chase-money, payable to the parties entitled to receive the same under the decree,
or to such person as the court may direct, conditioned for the payment of the pur
chase-money, with interest at the rate borne by the decree, to the time when the
same, as directed by the decree, shall fall due; such bond shall be returned and
filed in the clerk"s office, and if not paid at maturity, shall have the force and effect
of a judgment; and the clerk shall issue execution thereon. If any of the obligees
be dead, the execution shall be in favor of the survivors and the representatives of
those deceased. And in all decrees for the sale of real estate, the chancellor may
fix a sum to be paid on sale, and if the sale be not confirmed, the sum so paid shall
be returned to the bidder. If the purchaser fail to pay the amount of his bid or to
comply with the decree, the amount advanced shall go to the party entitled to the
purchase-money, and the land shall be resold.
The presumptions of validity which the lnw attaches to ancient deeds will aid an administrator's or
executor's sale. Stevenson v. McReary, 12 Smed. & M., 9.
Failure to pive the prescribed notice will not render the sale void. Bland v. Muncaster 24 Miss 62 ■
Hanks v. Neal, 44 Miss., 212.
600. Bond to prevent confirmation (Laws 1884, p. 71). —The party who objects
to a sale under a decree because of the inadequacy of the bid, or any person inter
ested therein, may prevent the confirmation thereof by entering into bond in a
penalty equal to double the amount of the bid, with sufficient sureties, to be
approved by the court or clerk, payable to the opposite party, conditioned to pay all
costs of a resale, and that the property shall bring thereat an advance of not less
than twenty per centum upon the bid, exclusive of the costs of resale.
The statute relates to the remedy. Clmffe v. Aaron, G2 Miss., 29.
One who procures a resale under the statute must be treated as starting the bidding on the resale at
twenty per centum advance on the former sale. Mason v. Martin, 0! Miss., 572.
601 (2044). Court may fix terms of sale.—All property may be sold on such
terms and at such time and place as the court may direct.
602 (2048). Lien on land sold on credit.—All land sold under decree of the
chancery court shall be held liable and subject to a lieu for the unpaid purchase
242

CHANCERY COURTS.

603-606

money therefor as if a mortgage had been executed by the purchaser and duly
recorded; and said lien shall exist until actual payment of the purchase-money, or
until, by order of the court or chancellor, the same shall be discharged.
An administrator or executor who charges himself with the receipt of the money is estopped to deny the
payment; and the heirs are estopped if they do not object thereto on final settlement. Lambeth v. Elder,
44 Miss., 80.
603. Person making sale not to purchase.—In no instance shall the person
who makes the sale become, either directly or indirectly, the purchaser at a sale
made by him.
604 (2049). Hour and adjournment of sales. —A sale of re,al estate shall not
commence before the hour of eleven o'clock on the day appointed, nor continue
longer, than four o'clock of the same day ; but if the time be insufficient to com
plete the sale, it may be continued from day to day until completed, hy giving pub
lic notice to the company present at the conclusion of each day's sale ; and such
sale on the succeeding day shall commence and end as directed for the first day.
605 (2050). Report of sale of land. —And when the sale has been completed,
the person making the same shall make report thereof in writing to the court,
stating the time and place of sale, the name of the purchaser, and the amount of
purchase-money, and shall satisfy the court that the directions prescribed'iu the
decree of sale and the law have been followed ; and thereupon the court shall pro
ceed to make a decree confirming the sale, unless good reason be shown to the con
trary. And the court shall order the person who made the sale to make a convey
ance to the purchaser of the land so sold; but if the sale be not reported to the
following term, the court may compel the making of a proper report at a subse
quent term, and may then confirm or set aside the same; and the person failing to
make such report in proper time may be fined, as for a contempt, not exceeding one
hundred dollars.
It is not an objection to an administrator's sale that he was ordered by the decree to sell and report to a
certain term of the court, and that he did not sell until after that time. Yerger v. Ferguson, 55 Miss., 190.
If the decree confirming the sale recite that notice of the sale was given, this is sufficient on appeal,
though the notice do not appear of record. Yerger v. Ferguson, 55 Miss., 190.
Confirmation of a sale, reported at a term subsequent to that which next followed the sale, without
notice, is not void. (Learned v. Matthews, 40 Miss., 210, overruled.) Johnson v. Cooper, 5G Miss., 60S.
606 (2051). On death of executor, or other person authorized, who shall
sell or convey.—If the executor, administrator, guardian, master, or special com
missioner who was ordered to make a sale or lease, shall die, resign, or be removed
before doing it, such sale or lease may be made by the successor of such executor,
administrator, guardian, master, or commissioner, or by any person appointed by
the court or the chancellor in vacation to make it, and, in case of the death, resig
nation, or removal of an executor, administrator, guardian, master, or commissioner,
after making a sale, and before its report or confirmation, or before a conveyance of
the title, in case of the sale of laud, the court shall ascertain the facts, and, if
satisfied that the sale ought to be confirmed, shall make a decree confirming it, and
order a conveyance, if land were sold, to be made to the purchaser, cither by the
successor in the administration or guardianship of the person who made the sale,
or by a master or commissioner appointed for that purpose; and such conveyance
shall have the same effect to vest the title in the person to whom it is made, as if
it had been made and delivered by the person who made the sale. (See § 2442.)

607-620

CIRCUIT COURTS.

607. Sales may be reported and confirmed in vacation. —Reports of sales or

court.—All the provisions of this chapter on the subject of sales shall apply to all

circuit court may impanel grand and petit juries, and shall have full jurisdiction to

lar term. Parties and witnesses shall be bound to attend ; and witnesses duly sub
poenaed or bound by recognizance, shall be subject to the same penalties for failure
to attend as if such failure had occurred at a regular term. On receiving the order
for a special term, if it be held because of a failure of a regular term, the proper
officers shall open the envelopes containing the names of the jurors for such regular
term, if it have not been done, and the venire facias shall issue and the jurors be

Miss., 675.
633 (1484). The clerk.—The clerk of the circuit court, before he enters upon

than three thousand dollars, nor more than ten thousand dollars, to be fixed by the
248

CIRCUIT COURTS.

634-638

order of the board of supervisors of the county, with two or more sufficient sureties,
conditioned according to law. And he may be required to give additional bond
from time to time, for the faithful application of all moneys coming into his hands
by law or order of the court; but such additional bonds shall be cumulative
security, and the original bond shall likewise cover all moneys coming into the
hands of the clerk by law or order of the court.
634. Dockets to be kept and entries made; general docket.—The clerk shall
keep a general docket, in which he shall enter the names of the parties in each
case, the time of filing the declaration, indictment, record from inferior court on
appeal or certiorari, petition, plea, or demurrer, and all other papers in the cause, the
issuance and return of process, and a note of all judgments rendered therein, by
reference to the minute-book and page; and shall mark on the papers in every
cause the style and number of the suit, and the time when, and the party by whom
filed ; and he shall not suffer any paper so filed to be withdrawn but by leave of the
court, and then only by retaining a copy, to be made at the cost of the party
obtaining the leave. All the papers and pleadings filed in a cause shall be kept in
the same file, and all the files kept in numerical order. Entries in criminal cases
shall not be made on the docket so as to disclose the names of the defendants until
their arrest. And the docket shall be duly indexed, both directly and indirectly, in
the alphabetical order of the names of each of the parties. (See § 463.)
635 (1485). The same; issue-docket. —Before each term of the court the clerk
shall make out a docket, in which he shall enter all cases triable at the approach
ing term in the order in which they are filed and numbered; and, under the control
of the court or judge, he shall set the causes for the several days of the term, com
mencing with the first day, and proceeding so far in the term as the number of
suits may require. Subpoenas shall be made returnable on the day for which the
case may be set; and a case shall not be taken up for trial before that day, except
by consent. The court shall call the cases in the order in which they stand on the
docket, and each case shall be tried or continued, or set for trial on a future day,
before proceeding to the trial of any other, except by consent.
It is error for the court to compel the trial of a case at an earlier da}- than that at which it had been set
down for trial by the clerk. Fall v. Commissioners, 3 Smed. & M., 127.
But this rule does not apply to "privilege" causes. Tifft v. Verden, 11 Smed. & M., 153.
A failure of the clerk to make out the dockets as required is a breach of his official bond. Brown v.

prescribed by law; and such court shall have power to hear and determine all pros
ecutions in the name of the state for treason, felonies, crimes, and misdemeanors,
except such as maybe exclusively cognizable before some other court; and said
court shall have all the powers belonging to a court of oyer and terminer and gen
eral jail delivery, and may do and perform all other acts properly pertaining to a
circuit court of law.
The circuit court has jurisdiction where there is no other legal remedy. Madison Co. v. Alexander,
Walker, 523; Planters v. Cramer, 47 Miss., 200
The circuit court, on an appeal or certiorari from a justice of the peace, has such jurisdiction only as the
justice had. Glass v. Moss, 1 How. (Miss.), 519; Crapoo v. Grand Gulf, 9 Sm<>d. & -M , 205; Steir v. Surget,
10 Smed. & M., 154; Scofield v. Pensons, 20 Miss., 402 ; Askew v. Askew, 49 Miss., 301 ; Bell v. West Point,
51 Miss., 262.
This rule does not apply in unlawful entry and detainer cases. Poston v. Mhoon, 49 Miss., 620.
The circuit court may consolidate several cases where the parties are the same on both sides and a single
judgment can settle the rights of all. Ammon v. Whitehead, 31 Miss., 99; Spratley v. Kitchens, 55 Miss.,
578; McLendon v. Pass, 66 Miss., 110.
The principal of the amount in controversy at the time the suit is brought, after deducting credits, if any,
is the test of jurisdiction. Martin v. Harding, 52 Miss., 694.
Garnishment is not an original suit, and the circuit court may issue and render judgment thereon for
amounts within the justices' jurisdiction. Martin v. Harvey, 54 Miss., 685.
A claimant's issue is not an original suit. Bernheimer v. Martin, 66 Miss., 486.
The original jurisdiction of the circuit court can be made, by statute, to embrace contested election cases.
Hall v. Lyon, 59 Miss., 218.
Where jurisdiction is given to a court by the constitution, it cannot be conferred exclusively on any other
court by the legislature. Montross v. Stnte. 61 Miss., 429.
The pleadings, where honest, fix and determine the amount in controversy. Fenn v. Harrington, 54
Miss , 733.
646. Jurisdiction of cases transferred or remanded to it.—The circuit court
shall have jurisdiction of all cases transferred to it by the chancery court or
remanded to it by the supreme court.
647 (1494). Motions against officers for money collected.—The circuit court
shall hear and determine all motions against attorneys at law, sheriffs, coroners, and
other officers, for money collected or received as such, and not paid over on demand
to the party entitled to the same, and may give judgment and award execution

648 (1495). Judgments and executions. —The circuit court' may render judg
ments according to the principles and usages of law, in all cases cognizable before

and the court, upon legal conviction of a person of a crime or misdemeanor, shall
proceed to judgment and award execution thereon as the law directs.
649 (1497). Suit for sum below the jurisdiction.—If a suit shall be brought
in the circuit court for a sum less than the court can take cognizance of, or if a
greater sum than is due shall be demanded, on purpose to confer jurisdiction, the
plaintiff shall be non-suited ; and if the- plaintiff, in any case, shall not recover
more than two hundred dollars, he shall not recover any costs of the defendant
unless the judge shall be of the opinion, and so enter on the record, that the
plaintiff had reasonable ground to expect to recover more than two hundred dol
lars, or unless the court shall have jurisdiction of the cause, without respect to the
amount in controversy. (See §878, which relates to actions ex delicto.)
It must appear that a greater sum than two hundred dollars was demanded on purpose to evade the law
requiring suits for sums ot" and under that amount to be brought before a justice of the peace, or the plaintiff
cannot be non-suited. Griffin v. Lower, 37 Miss., 45S.
The test of jurisdiction is the amount demanded in the pleadings, subject to be defeated, if shown to be
an attempt to evade the stutute. (Stephen v. Eiseman, 54 Miss., 535, distinguished.) Feun v. Harrington, 54
Miss., 733.
The entry of the opinion of the judge that the plaintiff had ground to expect to recover over two hun
dred dollars must be made at the term at which the judgment is rendered. Shackleford v. Levy, 63 Miss., 125.
The statute only relates to actions ex contractu. Kansas R. R. Co. v. Mabrr, 67 Miss., 131.
650 (1498). Venue of actions; in what county, generally.—Civil actions of
which the circuit court hits original jurisdiction shall be commenced in the county
in which the defendants or any of them may be found, except where otherwise pro
vided, and except actions of ejectment and actions of trespass on land, which shall
be brought in the county where the land, or some part thereof, is situated; but if
the land be in two or more counties, and the defendant reside in either of them, the
action shall be brought in the county of his residence, and in such cases process
may be issued against the defendant to any other county. If a citizen resident in
this state shall be sued in any action, not local, out of the county of his household
and residence, the venue shall be changed, on his application, to the county of his
household and residence.
Where an action is begun against several persons and none are served in the county, and the suit is dis
missed as to those who reside there, and who have never been served, jurisdiction will be gone. Wolley v.
Bowie, 41 Miss., 553.
If the defendant in the county be served, the suit may be discontinued as to him without losing jurisdic
tion. Read v. Renaud, 6 Smed. k M., 79.
Where the defendant, after the commencement of a suit but before the service of process on him, removes
into another county, plaintiff may have a testatum writ. Andrews v. Powell, 41 Miss., 729.
Where duplicate writs are issued and are served upon all of the defendants in a county other than that
in which the suit was brought, and the process to the county where the suit is brought was returned "not
found" as to all, the court should dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction on a showing that all . defendants,
at the time the suit was begun, lived out of the county. Bank v. Jennings, 5 How. (Miss.), 425.
Ejectment and trespass quare clausum frogit are the only ordinary actions which can be brought in a
county where the defendant does not reside and is not found. Elder v. Hilzheitn, 35 Miss., 231 ; Archibald
v. Mississippi R. R. Co., 66 Miss., 424.
The rule as to change of venue applies to an executor or administrator. McLeod v. Shelton, 42 Miss., 51 7.
If the party entitled to a change of venue fail to apply therefor the court may render judgment.
Christian v. O'Neal, 46 Miss., 669; Cain v. Simpson, 53 Miss., 521.
Motions against sheriffs for failure to return executions are determinable in the court to which the execu
tion is returnable, and a change of venue will not be granted to the county of the officer's residence. Cox
v. Ross, 56 Miss., 481.
The statute for change of venue does not apply in favor of a defendant in attachment brought in a
count3r other than that of his residence, where jurisdiction has been secured by a levy on effects or debts of
the defendant. Smith v. Mulliern, 57 Miss., 591 ; Baum v. Burns, 66 Miss., 124.
252

CIRCUIT COURTS.

651-655

An action is not " an action of trespass on land" within the meaning of the statute unless there exists the
elements of force and entry necessary to constitute the common law action of quare clausum fregit. Archi
bald v. Mississippi R. R. Co., 6G Miss., 424.
651 (1499). Actions against railroad companies, etc.—Actions against any
railroad, express, steam-boat, or telegraph corporation, or against individuals own
ing, managing, operating, or controlling a railroad, express line or route, steam-boat

652 (1500). Actions against insurance companies.—Actions against insurance
companies may be brought in an\T county in which a loss may occur, or, if on a life
policy, in the county in which the beneficiary resides, and process may be sent to

in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation or company
may be, and in a case of a foreign corporation or company may be brought in any
county where service of process may be had on an agent of such corporation or
company.
653 (1520). Actions against executors, etc., out of the state.—Executors,
administrators, or guardians, appointed in this state and residing out of it, ma}' be
sued in the county of their appointment, and may be made parties to such suit, so
as to authorize judgment against them, by publication of summons made as pro
vided for in the case of absent and non-resident defendants.
654 (1501). Where brought when judge interested.—If the judge of the
court be a party to or interested in any suit about to be commenced, the suit may
be instituted in an adjacent district, and the process may be issued to and served in
any county where the defendant maybe found; or the suit may be brought as if
the judge were not a party to or interested in it.
655 (1502). Change of venue because of prejudice, etc.—When either party to
any civil action in the circuit court shall desire to change the venue, he shall present
to the court, or to the judge of the district, a petition setting forth under oath that
he has good reason to believe, and does believe, that, from the undue influence of
the adverse party, prejudice existing in the public mind, or for some other sufficient
cause to be stated in the petition, he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in the
county where the action is pending, and that the application is made as soon as
convenient after being advised of such undue influence, prejudice, or other cause,
and not to delay the trial or to vex or harrass the adverse party. On reasonable
notice in writing to the adverse party of the time and place of making the applica
tion, if made in vacation, the court, if in term time, or the judge in vacation, shall
hear the parties and examine the evidence which either may adduce, and may award
a change of venue to some convenient county where an impartial trial may be had,
and, if practicable, in which the circuit court may next be held. If made in vaca
tion, the order shall be indorsed on the petition and directed to the clerk, who shall
file the same with the papers in the suit. (For change of venue in criminal cases,,
see § 1411.)
The statute must be substantially complied with; a change of venue, unless the statute be followed, even,
by agreement, is error. Wilson v. Rodewald, 49 Miss., 506.
The statute applies only to civil actions begun by ordinary summons and not to attachments. Baum v.
Burns. 66 Miss.. 124.
253

■

656-661

CIRCUIT COURTS.

On an application for a change of venue in term-time an order of court is necessary. Saunders v. Moss,
3 How. (Miss.), 101.
An affidavit for a change of venue is not a part of the record unless made so by bill of exceptions.
Grant v. Planters, 4 How. (Miss.), 326.
656 (1503). The same; papers transmitted. — When au order for a change of
venue shall be made, the clerk shall make out a descriptive list of all the papers in

all the papers, with a copy of the descriptive list, and copy of the orders and judg
ments, and the bill of costs, into a package, to be well covered and sealed up, and
directed to the clerk of the court to which tlie suit is ordered removed; and shall,
if not otherwise directed by the judge, take the receipt of the party obtaining the
change of venue for the papers contained on said list, and deliver the package to
said party, to be carried to the clerk of the court to whom it may be directed, or it
may be sent by mail, postage paid, or by express, the clerk taking proper receipt
therefor.
657 (1504). The same; papers received and receipted for. —The clerk to whom
the papers may be transmitted shall open the package and compare the papers with
the descriptive list, and shall give the person delivering the same, if demanded, a
receipt therefor. He shall then enter the cause on his docket as if it had been com
menced in the court of which he is clerk, and issue subpoenas for witnesses as in
other cases.
658 (1505). The same; venue changed but once. —A civil suit shall not be
removed more than once, or in any other manner than as prescribed, and in 110
case where it shall appear that there has been unnecessary delay or negligence in
milking the application.
659 (1506). The same; provisions applicable to districts in county. —The
provisions for a change of venue shall be applied in those counties where there are
two places of holding circuit courts in the same manner as if each district were a
separate county.
660 (1507). Parties; assignee of chose in action may sue, when. —The
assignee of any chose in action may sue for and recover on the same in his own
name if the assignment be in writing. In case of a transfer of interest after suit
brought, the action shall be continued in the name of the original party, or the
court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the
action. A setrott* or other defense existing at the time of or before notice of
the assignment, shall not be prejudiced thereby.
In a suit by an indorsee of a note against the maker the latter will be entitled to use as a set-off an open
account which was acquired by assignment before suit. Phipps v. Shegog, 30 Miss., 241.
And this is true, though the assignment of the account was not in writing. Ashbv v. Cart, 40 Miss., 64;
Hunt v. Shaekleford, 55 Miss., 94.
But the right is purely defensive unless, the assignment be in writing. Pollard v. Thomas, 61 Miss., 150.
The equitable holder of a chose in action, to whom a written assignment is not made, cannot sue in his
own name. Lowenburg v. Jones, 50 Miss., 6S8.
The person to whom a claim for damages for injury to personal property has been assigned in writing,
can sue thereon in his own name. Chicago It. R. Co. v. Packwood, 59 Miss., 280.
It is no defense that the cause of action has been assigned since the beginning of the suit, and is still
prosecuted in the name of the assignor. Montgomery v. Handy, 63 Miss., 43.
661 (1508). Unmarried female may sue for seduction.—An unmarried female
may prosecute an action for her own seduction, and recover damages.
251

CIRCUIT COURTS.

662-666

662 (1509). Action for seduction of a daughter. —A father or mother may
bring an action for the seduction of a daughter, although such daughter be not
living with nor in the service of the plaintiff, and though there be no loss of
service ; but a recovery by the father, mother, or daughter shall bar any other
action for the same cause.
663 (1510). Actions for injuries producing death. — Whenever the death of
any persons shall be caused by any such wrongful or negligent act or omission as
would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured or damaged thereby
to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, and such deceased
person shall have left a widow or children, or both, or husband or father or mother,
the person or corporation, or both, that would have been liable if death had not ensued,
and the representative of such person, shall be liable for the damages, notwith
standing the death ; and the action may be brought, in the name of the widow for the
death of her husband, or by the husband for the death of his wife, or by the parent
for the death of*a child, or in the name of a child for the death of au only parent ;
the damages to be for the use of such widow, husband, or child, except that in case
a widow should have children the damages shall be distributed as personal property
of the husband. In every such action the jury may give such damages as shall be
fair and just with reference to the injury resulting from such death to the person
suing; but every such action shall be commenced within one year after the death of
such deceased person.
Where the injury resulting in death occurs in another state having a statute substantially corresponding
to ours, the remedy may be enforced here. Chicago R. It. Co. v. Doyle, 00 Miss., 977.
Independently of the statute the mother, being the only surviving parent, may maintain a suit for injuries
resulting in the death of au infant sou, for the time between the injury and death. Natchez E. R. Co. v.
Cook, 63 Miss., 36.
The right of action is independent of that given to the executor and administrator. Vicksburg R. R.
Co. v. Phillips, 61 Miss., 693.
When the suit is broughf by the widow for the death of a husband and father, she can compromise and
thereby bind her children. Natchez Cotton Mills v. Mullins, 67 Miss., 672.
664 (1511). Non-joinder or misjoinder of plaintiffs.—The non-joinder or mis
joinder of a plaintiff shall not be objected to by the defendant at the trial, unless
he give written notice thereof with his plea, stating the name of the person alleged
to be omitted or improperly joined; and the court or judge, at any time before the
trial of the issue, whether of law or fact, may allow the declaration and writ to be
amended so as to obviate the objection, upon such terms as may be proper.
An objection because of the non-joinder of all the obligees in a bond in a suit thereon, cannot lie availed
of at the trial unless written notice thereof be given with the plea. Stauffer v. Garrison, Gl Miss., 07;
Walker v. Hall, 66 Miss., 390.
665 (1512). Non-joinder or misjoinder of defendants.—The non-joinder or
misjoinder of a defendant in any action upon contract shall not be objected to by
a defendant on the trial of the cause unless he give written notice thereof with his

and upon such notice being given, the court or judge, at any time before the trial
of the cause, may allow an amendment to the pleading so as to obviate the objec
tion, upon such terms as may be proper.
666 (1515). Death of one of several parties.—If there be two or more plaintiffs
or defendants in any suit, and one or more of them die, if the cause of action sur
vive to the surviving plaintiff or against the surviving defendant, the suit shall pro
255

667-671

CIRCUIT COURTS.

ceed in the name of the surviving plaintiff against the surviving defendant; and
where either party shall die between verdict and judgment, such death need not
be suggested in abatement, but judgment may be entered as if both parties were
living; and if, 011 the death of any plaintiff' in actions which survive, before verdict,
the heir, legatee, or devisee, executor, administrator, or other legal representatives
of such deceased party, shall not appear and become a party to the action, on or
before the second term of the court next after the death of such party shall have
been suggested on the record, the action shall be dismissed, unless good cause be
shown to the contrary.
A dismissal at the first term after the death of a party is suggested, and before the administrator has
become a party, is not void, bat erroneous. American Co. v. Shaughnessy, 59 Miss., 398.
667 (1516). Death of nominal plaintiff" not to abate action.—If suit be com
menced in the name of any person for the use and benefit of another, the same
shall not abate by the death of the nominal plaintiff, but shall progress to a final
judgment and execution in like manner as if brought in the name of the person
for whose use and benefit such suit was instituted, who shall be liable for the costs
of suit as in other cases ; and in case the party for whose use and benefit a suit
shall be brought shall die before final judgment, it shall be lawful for the party rep
resenting such deceased person as executor or administrator, to be entered on the
record of such suit in the place of such deceased person.
The statute does not abate the suit upon the usee's death, but merely makes it lawful for the adminis
trator to be entered in the place of the deceased. Lee v. Gardner, '26 Miss , 521.
668 (1517). Death of defendant after judgment.—When judgment shall have
been rendered against two or more persons, and any one or more of them shall die,
such judgment shall survive against the representatives of the deceased parties and
the survivor; and a scire facias may issue against the survivor, jointly with the rep
resentatives of the deceased parties; and such judgment may be thereupon revived,
and execution issued in like manner.
669 (1521). Certain actions not to abate.—Actions by or against public offi
cers in their official character, or by or against trustees or commissioners in refer
ence to the trust committed to them, or by or against persons who occupy a similar
position to that of public officers, trustees, or commissioners, shall not abate on
account of the change of the person occupying such position, but may be revived
and proceeded with in the name of the successor of such person.
670 (1522). Filing declaration the commencement of an action.—Except in
cases in which it is otherwise provided, the manner of commencing an action in
the circuit court shall be by filing in the office of the clerk of such court a declara
tion, on which a summons for the defendant shall be immediately issued; and an
action shall, for all purposes, be considered to have been commenced and to be
pending from the time of the filing of the declaration, if a summons shall be issued
thereon for the defendant, and, if not executed, other like process, in succession,
may be issued, in good faith, for the defendant.
671 (1536). Of pleadings; the declaration.—The declaration shall contain a
statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise
language, without repetition ; and if it contain sufficient matter of substance for
the court to proceed upon the merits of the cause, it shall be sufficient; and it shall
256

CIRCUIT COURTS.

672-677

not be an objection to maintaining any action that the form thereof should have
been different.
All that is required is a written statement of the facts in ordinary and concise language. Lamkin v.
Nye, 43 Miss., 241.
The statute is said to abolish all forms of action. Evans v. Miller, 58 Miss., 120.
672 (1537). Statement of venue. — The name of the county shall be stated in
the margin of the declaration, and it shall not be necessary to state any venue in
the body of the declaration or in any subsequent pleading, nor to set forth in any
manner the place in which an act is alleged to have been done, unless, from the
nature of the case, the place be material or traversable.
673 (1539). How names of defendants stated if unknown. —When the plaint
iff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated
by any name ; and when his true name shall be discovered, the pleading or proceed
ing may be amended accordingly.
674 (1539). Defendant may be sued by initials in certain cases —In actions
on written instruments, the defendant may be sued by the initial letters or contrac
tion of the Christian name, used by him in his signature to such writing. 675 (1539). Averments that partners contracted by a name affixed to a
writing is sufficient.—In actions against one or more of several partners, it shall
be sufficient to declare that he or they made the contract or executed the writing
sued on by the copartnership name, or other signature affixed to such writing.
Partner;; cannot sue or be sued by their partnership name. Blackwell v. Reed, 41 Miss., 102.
676 (1540). Copy of account or writing filed with declaration.—There shall
be annexed to or filed with the declaration in every case founded on an open
account, a copy of the account or bill of particulars of the demand; and in actions
, founded on any writing, a copy of such writing, with the names of subscribing wit
nesses, if any, shall be annexed to or filed with the declaration ; and evidence thereof
shall not be given on the trial unless so annexed or filed; and the same shall con
stitute a part of the record of the cause.
The bill of particulars must state distinctly the several items of the claim. A general statement " that
the defendant was, before a particular day, indebted to the plaintiff in $8,000, for money before that time
loaned" is not sufficient. Soria v. Planters' Bank, 3 How. (Miss.), 46.
A statement of the amounts of invoices is insufficient. Pipes v. Norton, 47 Miss., 61.
Whatever of the writing sued on is material should be set forth in the declaration. Marshall v. Hamil
ton, 41 Miss., 229.
An insufficient bill of particulars can be amended. Bloom v. McGrath, 53 Miss., 249.
If the declaration accurately specify each item, it is sufficient without a bill of particulars. Nevitt v.
Rabe, 5 How. (Miss.), 653; Tierney v. Duffy, 59 Miss., 364.
Unless objection be made in the lower court because of the absence of the bill of particulars, none can
be made in the supreme court. Tierney v. Duffy, 59 Miss., 364.
The office of the bill of particulars is to give the defendant specific information of the cause of action;
it cannot, therefore, be less specific than the declaration, nor include any items not within the scope of the
pleading. Chicago R. R. Co. v. Provine, 61 Miss., 288.
A promissory note sued on and filed with the declaration, thereby becomes a part of the record.
(Gale v. Lancaster, '14 Miss., 413, distinguished.) Hamer v. Rigby, 65 Miss., 41.
677 (1541). Writing filed and made part of record.—A copy of any writing
of which profert is made, or ought to be made, in any pleading, shall be annexed
to or filed with the pleading, with the names of the subscribing witnesses, if any,
and evidence thereof shall not be given at the trial unless so annexed or filed; and
every writing filed with any pleading, as part of it, shall thereby become a part of
it, and be so considered for all purposes of the action.

CIRCUIT COURTS.

678 (1542). Declaration on bonds with a condition.—In all actions upon
bonds with a condition the plaintiff shall state the condition and assign breaches
thereof in his declaration; and evidence shall not be given of any breach uuassigued.
The jury shall assess damages for such of the breaches so assigned as may be proved,
and execution shall issue for so much, and the judgment shall stand as a security to
the plaintiff for any other breaches that may afterward happen ; and he may have
a scire facias thereon and assign any other breach, and thereupon damages shall ho
assessed and execution issued as before.
In a suit upon a bond, where defendant pleads a former recovery, it is not a good replication to aver that
the breaches, which had occurred before the former suit, are different from those in said suit, and were
unknown to the plaintiff when the suit was brought, without an averment of a fraudulent concealment
thereof by the defendant; and the statute does not affect this. State v. Morrison, 60 Miss., "4.
679 (1543). In trespass, place of trespass described.—In actions of trespass
to land, the place of the alleged trespass shall be designated in the declaration by
name, or abuttals, or other proper description.
680 (1544). Declaration for libel or slander. —In actions for libel or slander
the plaintiff may aver that the words or matter complained of were used in a
defamatory sense, specifying such sense, without any prefatory averment to show
how such words or matter were used iu that sense; and such averment shall be put
in issue by the denial of the alleged libel or slander ; and where the words or mat
ter set forth, with or without the alleged meaning, show a cause of action, the
declaration shall be sufficient.
681 (1546). Of pleas, replications, etc.—All the provisions hereinbefore con
tained in reference to the form and sufficiency of the declaration, shall extend and
apply to the pleas of the defendant, and to all subsequent pleadings in the cause,
so far as the same may be applicable.
682 (1547). Several pleas in abatement.—The defendant may plead at the same
time as many matters as he may have to the jurisdiction of the court, to the disa
bility of the plaintiff, and in abatement of the writ or declaration ; and he shall set
forth the matters in separate pleas, and in plain, intelligible, concise language, with
out regard to technical form ; and where the matter pleaded does not appear on
record, he shall verify such plea by the oath or affirmation of himself or some other
credible person.
683 (1548). What pleas in bar may be pleaded together.—The following pleas
in bar, or any two or more of them, may be pleaded together as of course, when
appropriate to the action, without leave of the court or judge, to wit : The general
issue, denial of the debt or contract sued on, tender in whole or in part, statute of
limitations, set-off, plene admiuistravit, infancy, payment, accord and satisfaction,
release, not guilty, a denial of plaintiff's property in the thing injured, leave and
license, duress, son assault demesne, performance, justification in libel, slander, and
other actions, and any other pleas which by law are allowed to be pleaded together.
Under a statute like that of Anne, enacted here as early as 1807, changing the common law rule of a
single issue, all consistent defenses could be pleaded together; the code 1857 first authorized the pleading of
certain inconsistent pleas. Under the existing statute enumerating pleas which may be filed together, defend
ant is not precluded from joining other pleas which he might have joined before the statute. State v. Mor
gan, 59 Miss., 349.
684 (1548). Penalty for mispleading.—If any party shall, without leave of
the court, plead several pleas, replications, or other pleadings together, except in
258

CIRCUIT COURTS.

685-687

cases where the same is allowed by law, the opposite party shall be entitled to judg
ment as for want of the proper pleading; but such judgment may be set aside, on
affidavit of merits and payment of costs and such other terms as the court may
think fitWhen the statute is violated a motion to strike out the plea, if made, should be sustained. The judgment
authorized is a final judgment, and can only be set aside by compliance with the statute. Hartford v. Green,
52 Miss., 332; Hunter v. Wilkinson, 44 Miss., 721.
The statute does not apply to the action of replevin. Bennett v. Holloway, 55 Miss., 211.
685 (1549). Mitigating circumstances. —In actions for libel or slander, assault
and battery, and false imprisonment, the defendant, under the plea of not guilty,
may give in evidence any mitigating circumstances to reduce the damages, notwith
standing he may also have pleaded a justification.
686 (1550). Notice of special matter under general issue.—If the defendant
desire to prove under the general issue in an action any affirmative matter in avoid
ance, which by law may be proved under such plea, he shall give notice thereof in
writing, annexed to or filed with the plea, otherwise such matter shall not be allowed
to be proved at the trial ; and the defendant may, in all cases, plead the general issue
and give written notice therewith of any special matter which he intends to give in
evidence in bar of the action, and which he would be otherwise obliged to plead
specially; and, when such notice shall be given by the defendant, the plaintiff shall,
before the trial of the cause, file a written notice to the defendant of any special
matter which he intends to give in evidence in denial or avoidance of such special
matter so given notice of by the defendant, and which it would have been necessary
to reply specially had the defendant's defense been specially pleaded; and if notice
be not given as required, evidence of such matters shall not be admissible on the
trial.
It is competent to prove a set-off under the general issue if the items of set off be filed with the plea and
notice given. Kershaw v. Merchants' Bank, 7 How. (Miss.), 386; Alliatou v. Lindsey, 12 Smed. & M., 656.
Evidence that the contract sued on was executed on Sunday is not admissible under the general issue,
without notice. Herndon v. Henderson, 41 Miss., 584.
The mode of avoiding matter proposed to be proved under a notice filed with the general issue setting up
an insufficient defense, is by objection to the evidence when offered. Wren v. Hoffman, 41 Miss., 016; New
Orleans R. li. Co. v. Wallace, 50 Miss., 244.
The statute narrows the scope and effect of the general issue; every defense not merely consisting of a
denial of the allegations of the declaration must be pleaded specially or notice thereof given under the gen
eral issue. Tittle v. Bonner, 53 Miss., 578.
Non-assumpsit to a declaration in assumpsit is sufficient notice of any defense which is a mer.e denial of
the contract sued on. Fitch v. Asher, 56 Miss., 571.
It is not allowable to give notice under special pleas. Wren v. Hoffman, 41 Miss., 616; Grayson v.
Brooks, 64 Miss., 410.
687 (1551). Set-off pleaded.—Where a mutual indebtedness exists between the
plaintiff and defendant, the defendant may plead and set off against the demand of
the plaintiff any debt or demand which he may have against the plaintiff; and if it
shall appear that the demand of the defendant is valid and equals the demand of
the plaintiff, the judgment shall be that the plaintiff take nothing by his writ and
pay the costs. And if it appear that any part of the sum demanded has been paid,
but that the plaintiff's demand exceeds that of the defendant, the amount paid shall
be deducted, and the plaintiff shall have judgment for the residue of his demand
only, with costs of suit. But if it appear that the plaintiff is overpaid, and is in
debted to the defendant, the defendant shall be entitled to judgment for the amount
259

688-690

circuit cociits.

due to him against the plaintiff for the amount so found, with costs, and execution
may issue therefor. (For set-off before justice of the peace, see § 2411.)
It is not necessary that an assignment should appear on a transferred note to enable the holder \f> use it
as a set-off. Glass v. Moss., 1 How. (Miss.), 519.
An open account transferred by delivery may be so used. Ashby v. Carr, 40 Miss., G4.
A set-off cannot be interposed by the maker of a note which has been assigned unless the set-off existed
at the time of the notice of the assignment. Northern Bank v. Kyle, 7 How. (Miss.), 360.
Under a plea of payment a bill of particulars is necessary to enable a defendant to avail himself of a
set-off. Vanzant v. Shelton, 40 Miss., 332.
Set-off is not available in a suit for unliquidated damages. Burrus v. Gordon, 57 Miss., 93.
An unliquidated claim for damages cannot be used as a set-off. Casper v. Thigpen, 48 Miss . 635.
If the action be by more than one plaintiff, and it is proposed to set off a debt of one plaintiff to the
defendant ; or if the action be against more than one defendant, and the proposed set-off be in favor of but
one of them, there will be a want of mutuality; but if the set-off be in favor of all of the defendants and
against all the plaintiffs and another person, and the debt be the several debt of each, it will be good. That
another party also owes the debt does not destroy its several character or destroy mutuality. Moody v. Wil
lis, 41 Miss , 347; Peyton v. Planters, 63 Miss., 410.
In an action of assumpsit, the defendant, having a claim as beneficiary under a deed of trust for the
value of property converted and sold by the plaintiff, may set off the same against the plaintiff's demand.
Hunt v. Shackleford, 55 Miss., 94.
Debts cannot be shown to be mutual by evidence that one or more of the debtors are mere sureties.
Peine v. Lewis, 64 Miss., 96.
A demand against one person cannot be set off against him and his nominal partner in a «uit by them
on a note made to the firm. A set off must be against all the plaintiffs. Jones v. Howard, 53 Miss., 707.
In an action by a clerk against a store keeper for the value of his services, the employer cannot set off
a demand for money lost from the cash-drawer owing to the clerk's negligence. Cobb v. Wilson, 60 Miss., 343.
A set-off is in the nature of a cross-action; and in a joint action by several plaintiffs, their separate
debts to the defendant cannot be set off against their joint demand. Denney v. Wheelwright, 60 Miss , 733.
The statute does not authorize a set-off against the state. Raymond v. State, 54 Miss., 562.
Recoupment is contradistinguished from set-off in three essential particulars: (1) It being confined to
matters arising out of and connected with the tfansaction, or contract, upon which the suit is brought; (2)
in having no regard to whether or not such matter be liquidated or unliquidated; (3) that the judgment is
not regulated by statute. Myers v. Estill, 47 Miss , 4.
688 (1554). Items of set-off filed. —If the defendant plead a set-off, or give
notice of any set-off under the general issue, or shall desire to prove any set-off
under plea of payment, he shall tile with his plea or notice an account, stating dis
tinctly the nature of the set-off and the several items thereof, and a copy of any
writing intended to he set-off; and on failure to do so, he shall uot be entitled to
prove such set-off on the trial.
The plea or notice must give the plaintiff full information of the character of the demand sought to be
set off. Phipps v. Shegogg, 30 Miss., 241 ; Curry v. Kurtz, 33 Miss., 24.
689 (1552). Balance of mutual dealings on death of one party.— Where there
shall have been mutual dealings between two or more persons, and one or more of
them shall die before an adjustment of such dealings, the lawful demands of such
parties against each other shall be a good payment, or set-off, to the amount thereof,
notwithstanding the estate of one or more of such deceased persons shall be insolvent,
and only the balance due shall be the debt.
A debt due by a deceased person cannot be set off against a note given to the administrator for a part of
the property sold by him. Mellen v. Boarninn, 13 Smed. & M., 100; Boles v. Hyman, 57 Miss., 330
690 (1553). Payment at or after maturity pleadable. — In all actions for the
recovery of any debt or demand alleged to be due by the defendant to the plaintiff,
it shall be lawful for the defendant to plead payment of the money demanded, at or
after the time when the same became due, or at any time before action brought, and,
under such plea, to prove any payments that have been made, in part or in full, of
the sum demanded. Statute applied. Cage v. Her, 5 Smed. & M., 410.

691-697
t
691 (1555). Disclaimer and tender of amends in trespass.—In actions for
trespass on land the defendant may plead that he disclaims any title or claim to the
land in question, and that the trespass was involuntary or by negligence, and that
he tendered or offered sufficient amends therefor before suit brought, and he shall
thereupon bring the amount so tendered into court; and unless the plaintiff in such
action shall recover more damages than the amount so tendered, he shall be adjudged
to pay the costs of the action.
692 (1556). Several replications pleaded by leave, etc.—The plaintiff in any
action may, by leave of the court or judge, plead in answer to the plea, or the sub
sequent pleading of the defendant, as many several matters as he shall think neces
sary to maintain his action ; and the defendant ma}", by like leave, plead in answer
to any pleading of the plaintiff subsequent to the declaration, as many several mat
ters as he may think necessary to his defense, upon the affidavit of the party making
such application that he is advised and believes that he- has just ground to traverse
the several matters proposed to be traversed by him, or that the several matters
sought to be pleaded by way of confession and avoidance are respectively true in
substance and fact.
The court has no discretion to waive the affidavit provided for by the statute or to mitigate the terms.
Hunier v. Wilkinson, 44 Miss., 721 ; Hartford v. Green, 52 Miss., 332.
693 (1557). Similiter not necessary.—Whenever any pleading concludes to the
country, issue shall be considered as joined thereon, unless a demurrer thereto be
filed.
694 (1558). Pleas puis darrein continuance.—Pleas after issue joined, or since
the last continuance, or at any stage of a case, shall not be held to be a substitute
for former pleas, or to waive any defense pleaded.
695 (1559). Costs when pleading held insufficient.— When a plea in abate
ment shall be adjudged insufficient, the plaintiff shall recover full costs to the time
of overruling the plea; and when, by an interlocutory judgment, any other part of
the pleading shall he adjudged insufficient, all costs occasioned by such bad plead
ing shall be adjudged against him who committed the fault.
696 (1560). Of demurrers; causes must be assigned. — When a demurrer shall
be interposed, the court shall not regard any defect or imperfection in the pleadings,
except such as shall be assigned for causes of demurrer, unless something so essen
tial to the action or defense be omitted that judgment according to law and the
right of the cause cannot be given.
A demurrer is a waiver by the demurrant of his right to have the pleading demurred to treated as a
nullity. Mayfield v. Barnard, 43 Miss., 270.
If the declaration be so defective " that judgment according to law and the right of the cause" cannot
be given, a demurrer to a plea may be extended back to the declaration. State v. Bowen, 45 Miss., 347 ;
Shoult v. Kemp, 57 Miss., 218.
A demurrer to the whole declaration, containing two counts, must be overruled if either count, taken by
itself, be good. Lynn v. Illinois B. R. Co., 03 Miss., 157.
697 (1561). Judgment on overruling demurrer to declaration. —If the
demurrer of the defendant to the declaration be overruled, the court shall give
judgment for the plaintiff for the amount due and interest; and a plea shall not be
admitted unless the defendant make oath that he has a good and substantial defense,
setting forth fully the nature of the defense, that the court may judge whether the
plea ought to be admitted or not.
261

698-705

CIRCUIT COURTS.

698 (1502). Judgment on sustaining demurrer to plea. —If the plaintiff demur
to the plea of the defendant, and the demurrer be sustained, the judgment shall be
that the defendant do answer over to tbe declaration ; but he shall be compelled to
plead to the merits, and the plaintiff' shall not be delayed of his trial. And if the
plea then filed be demurred to, and such demurrer be sustained, further leave to
plead shall not be granted.
Upon sustaining a demurrer to a plea, a failure to render judgment respondeat ouster is palpably errone
ous, but the supreme court will not reverse for that, if the merits of the case were litigated and the judgment
correct. [Lee v. Dozier, 40 Miss.. 477, explained.) Wilkinson v. Cook, 44 Miss., 367.
If a demurrer to a plea be sustained, judgment must be respondeat ouster, although there be another
plea on 61e on which issue is joined. Drane v. Madison Co., 42 Miss., 264.
The statute does not apply to a demurrer to a replication; if such demurrer be sustained, the judgment
is final. Memphis R. R. Co. v. Orr, 52 Miss., 541.
Unless the defendant obtain leave to plead over. Tittle v. Bonner, 5;> Miss., 578.
On overruling a demurrer to a plea, the judgment is not required to be respondeat ouster, but it is not
error to grant leave to the plaintiff to reply. Tittle v. Bonner, 53 Miss., 578.
On sustaining a demurrer to a second plea, amended after one demurrer sustained to it. the judgment
should not be respondeat ouster. Tittle v. Bonner, 53 Miss., 578.
But if the first demurrer were confessed, the rule is different. State v. Morgan, 59 Miss., 349.
If a replication erroneously conclude to the country, and a demurrer be sustained to it for that reason
judgment final should not go against the plaintiff, but the court should order the conclusion amended, with
leave to defendant to answer. Metcalf v. Grover, 55 Miss., 145; Northrop v. Flaig, 57 Miss., 754.
699 (1563). Frivolous demurrer.—The court may refuse to receive a demurrer
manifestly frivolous or intended for delay, or may strike out the same if filed, and
proceed as if such demurrer had not been offered.
700 (1564). Joinder not required.—A joinder in demurrer shall not be required
in any case.
701 (1565). Express color and special traverses.—Express color and special
traverses shall not be necessary in any pleading.
702 (1566). Pleadings to be signed. —A pleading shall be signed by the party
or his attorney.
703 (1567). Special demurrer abolished.—A pleading shall not be deemed
insufficient for any defect which could heretofore be objected to only by special
demurrer.
A demurrer to the form of a declaration is not maintainable. State v. Swinney, 60 Miss., 39.
It is error to sustain a demurrer to a special plea on the sole ground that it. amounts to the general issue.
Polkinghome v. Hendricks, 61 Miss., 366.
704 (1568). Obscure pleadings and redundant matter; how dealt with. —If
the allegations of a pleading be so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of
the complaint or defense be not apparent, or if any pleading be so framed as to
prejudice, embarrass, or delay a fair trial of the action, the court, on application of
the opposite party, shall cause the same to be made definite and certain, or may
strike the same from the files. Irrelevant or redundant matter inserted in a plead
ing may be stricken out on motion of any party.
705. Bill of particulars. —If the pleading in any case be in vague and general
terms, or do not specify the 'circumstances or the occasion's on which the pleader
relies, and the opposite party satisfy the court, by affidavit, that for the purpose of
prosecution or defense at the trial it is necessary that his adversary be more specific,
the court may order a bill of particulars to be rendered, specifying time, place, and
circumstances relied upon, and persons present, or, in case of contractual demands,
262

CIRCUIT COURTS.

706-713

more particularly itemizing the claim ; and thereafter on the trial evidence shall not
be admissible of matters not so specified.
Bills of particulars may be ordered without regard to the nature, subject, or form of the action. Tilton
v. Beacher, 59 N. Y , 176 (S. C. 17 Am. Rep., 337, and cases there cited).
706 (1569). Useless verbiage dispensed with.—AH allegations heretofore usu
ally inserted in declarations and other pleadings which are not material or traversa
ble, .and which the party could not be required to prove, may be omitted unless they
be required for the right understanding of allegations that are material.
707 (1570). Formal defense dispensed with.—Formal defense shall not be
required in a plea, but it may commence as follows: "The said defendant by his
attorney [or in person] says that." And it shall not be necessary to state in a second
or other plea that it is pleaded by leave of the court, or according to the form of the
statute, or to that effect.
708 (1571). Actionem non, precludi non, etc., unnecessary. —In a plea or
subsequent pleading, intended to be pleaded in bar of the whole action generally, it
shall not be necessary to use any allegation of actionem non or to the like effect, or
any prayer of judgment; nor shall it be necessary in any replication or subsequent
pleading pleaded in maintenance of the action, to use any allegation of precludi
non or to the like effect, or any prayer of judgment; and all pleas, replications,
and subsequent pleadings pleaded without such formal parts, shall be taken, unless
otherwise expressed, as pleaded respectively in bar of the whole action or in main
tenance of the whole action.
709 (1572). How private statutes may be pleaded. —If a private statute be
pleaded, it shall be sufficient to refer to it by its title and the date of its passage.
710 (1573). How private way may be pleaded.—A right by virtue of a pri
vate way may be pleaded generally in the same manner as in pleading a public way.
711. (1574). How performance of conditions may be pleaded. —In pleading
the performance of conditions precedent, the plaintiff or defendant may aver gen
erally that he duly performed all the conditions on his part; and the opposite party
shall not deny such averment generally, but shall specify in his pleading the condi-.
tion precedent the performance of which he intends to contest.
712 (1575). How judgment of court or officer of special jurisdiction may
be pleaded.—In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer
of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the facts conferring juris
diction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given
or made; and the facts conferring jurisdiction shall be shown at the trial.
Statute applied. Statu v. Bowen. 45 Miss., 347.
713 (1577). Offers of satisfaction by defendant.—The defendant in any per
sonal action, except actions for assault and battery, false imprisonment, libel, slander,
malicious arrest or prosecution, criminal conversation, or seduction, may offer with
his plea, or in writing afterwards, before trial, and pay into court a sum of money
by way of compensation or amends, and may plead that the same is sufficient to
satisfy the plaintiff in respect of the cause of action in the declaration mentioned.
If the plaintiff accept the same, judgment shall be entered therefor with costs ; but
if he fail to accept it, the offer shall be considered withdrawn, and shall not be
263

714-717

CIRCUIT COURTS.

given in evidence; and if the plaintiff fail to recover more than the sum so offered,
he shall pay all the costs accruing after such offer.
A tender after suit commenced is not good unless it include all accrued costs. Collier v. White, 67
Miss., 133.
714 (1578). Proceedings when third person claims subject of action.— Upon
affidavit of a defendant before plea filed in any action upon contract, or for the
recovery of personal property, that a third party, a resident of this state, without
collusion with him, has a claim to the subject of the action, and that he is ready to
pay or dispose of the same as the court may direct, the court may make an order
for the safe-keeping or payment, or deposit in court, or delivery of the subject-mat
ter of the action to such person as it ma}' direct, and an order requiring such third
party to be summoned to appear in a reasonable time and maintain or relinquish his
claim against the defendant. If such third party, being duly summoned, shall fail
to appear, the court may declare him barred of all claim in respect to the subject of
the action against the defendant therein ; but if such third party appear, he shall be
allowed to make himself defendant in the action at law instead of the original
defendant, who shall be discharged from all liability to either of the other parties,
in respect to the subject of the action, upon his compliance with the order of the
court for the payment, deposit, or delivery thereof. If the claim of such third
party extend to only a part of the subject-matter of the action, similar proceedings
may be had respecting the part so claimed, and the action shall proceed as to the
residue as in other cases.
The statute applies to suits before justices of the peace and to actions for money arising under contracts,
express or implied, as well as to suits for personal property. Moore v. Ernst, 54 Miss., 642.
The statute applies to a garnishee against whom replevin is brought for the property in his hands. Morin
v. Bailey, 55 Miss., 570.
The act of the original defendant does not make the third person a party; an order of court is necessary.
Ettringham v. Handy, tiO Miss., 334.
«
715 (1579). Preceding section applicable to officers, etc.—The provisions of
the last section shall be applicable to any action brought against a sheriff* or other
officer for the recovery of personal property taken by him under execution or at
tachment, or for the proceeds of property so taken and sold by him ; and the defend
ant in any such action shall have the benefit of said provisions against the party in
whose favor the execution or attachment issued by making affidavit that the prop
erty, for the recovery of which or its proceeds the action is brought, was Taken
under process, describing it; and in such case the judgment of the court shall be
framed to effect justice between the parties according to their rights.
716 (1580). Notice when plaintiff is non-resident. —If the plaintiff in such
execution or attachment be a non-resident of the state, the summons may be served
on his attorney, and shall have the same effect as if served personally on the party,
or he may be made a party by publication.
717 (1581). Amendments allowed. —The court shall have full power to allow
all amendments to be made in any pleading or proceeding at any time before ver
dict, so as to bring the merits of the controversy between the parties fairly to trial,
and may allow all errors and mistakes in the name of any party or in the form of
the action to be corrected; and the court shall require all such amendments to be
made on such terms, as to costs and delay, as may be proper to prevent surprise or
264

CIRCUIT COURTS.

718-719

undue advantage. Either party may except to the decision of the court allowing
or refusing amendments, and the same may be assigned for error.
A declaration in ejectment may be amended by correcting a mistake in the description of the land sued
for. Cooper v. Granberry, 33 Miss., 117.
Such an amendment was allowed after verdict in Metcalf v, McCutchen, 60 Miss., 145.
Four years after the commencement of the suit will not be too late for the plaintiff to apply for leave to
amend his declaration so as to make it correspond with the proof contained in a deposition, if the applica
tion be made at the first term after taking the deposition, and if it do not appear that the plaintiff knew the
facts before the deposition was taken. Miller v. Northern Bank, 34 Miss., 412.
If a jury be waived, and the case be tried by the judge, his finding is like a verdict, so far as concerns
the time lor amending. State v. Powers, 52 Miss., 198.
A plaintiff who has commenced a personal action may, after plea, change his action, and substitute for
his declaration in assumpsit a petition, in rem to enforce a mechanic's lien. Weathersby v. Sinclair, 43
Miss., 189.
And vice versa. Duff v. Snider, 54 Miss , 245; Noble v. Terrell, 64 Miss., 830.
An amendment by which the holder of the legal title is made nominal plaintiff is authorized; and if it
be an attachment case, sued out by the usee, it will be unnecessary to amend the affidavit or bond Montugife v. King, 37 Miss., 441; Tully v. Herrin, 44 Miss., 626.
The name of one nominal plaintiff may be substituted for another. Denton v. Stephens, 32 Miss. 194.

amend so as to make his demand for a greater number of trees. McCleary v. Anthony, 54 Miss., 70S.
An amendment to the declaration does not necessarily suspend the pleas filed to the original. Parisot v.
Helm, 52 Miss., 617.
If a party introduce evidence material to his case, but inadmissible under the pleadings, and objection
be not made, and the court, by instruction, exclude such evidence from consideration by the jury, an amend
ment to the pleading can then be made; it is not too late. Rodgers v. Kline, 56 Miss., 808.
Alter two terms, on issue joined upon the affidavit for writ of seizure (under act 1876), if both parties be
ready for trial, the plaintiff may even then tender the statement of this claim as required. Allen v. Standifer, 57 Miss , 612.
Where an affidavit was required for an appeal from a justice's court (code 1871), it was admissible to
amend it in the circuit court on motion to dismiss. Green v. Boon, 57 Miss., 617.
If the defendant have pleaded, not under oath, denying a partnership, and it has been treated by the
plaintiff as a plea, he should be allowed on the trial to file the proper sworn plea. Hirsch v. Shafer, 66
Miss., 439.
718 (1582). What variance material. —A variance between the allegation in a
pleading and the proof shall not be deemed material, unless it shall have actually
misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his-actioii or defense upon
the merits ; and where it shall not be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the
party has been so misled, an immediate amendment of the pleading may be made
without costs, and without delaying the cause. If the party have been so actually
misled, an amendment may be allowed on such terms as shall be just.
Where the declaration alleged the note sued on was executed in one place, and the note offered in evidence
was made in another, the variance is fatal. Carter v. Preston, 51 Miss., 423.
When objection is made because of a variance, an amendment may be made at once, unless the party
objecting be actually misled ; and the other party can object to joining in a demurrer to evidence because of
the variance. Ware v. McQuillan, 54 Miss., 703.
The objection because of variance must, be distinctly raised before verdict, and if made by an instruction
which is too vague to admonish the court or the opposing party thereof, it is insufficient. Greer v. Bubh, 57
Miss., 575.
719 (1588). When one of several counts faulty. —When there are several
counts in the declaration, one of which is faulty, defendant may apply to the court
to instruct the jury to disregard the faulty count; but if he fail to do so, and entire
damages be given, the verdict shall be good.

before the first day of the term to which the process is returnable, or within such
other time as the court, by rule or otherwise, may allow ; and, for want of plea,
judgment may be entered by default. All demurrers and dilatory pleas shall be
tried at the return-term, and the court shall require that the issue of fact, if any
there be, shall then be made up and joined ; but such issue of fact shall not be tried
before the next succeeding term without consent of parties, except in actions, ex
contractu in which the defendant has been personally served with process for thirty
days before the return-day, actions to enforce mechanics' liens, actions commenced
by attachment, and actions of replevin, in which such issues shall be tried at the
return-term, unless continued by consent, or on cause shown. Judgment by default
shall not be entered at the return-term, unless it appear that the process has been
served personally on the defendant.
Where service of the process is acknowledged by the defendant and a judgment by default final is taken,
in which it is recited that there was proof of the acknowledgment of the service, it will be sufficient. Win
ston v. Miller, 12 Smed. <fc M., 550.
The court can allow a defendant to plead out of time. (Pool v. Hill, 44 Miss., 306, explained.) McAdory v. Turner, 56 Miss., 666.
A judgment by default at the return-term, without personal service of process in a justice's court, is void.
Betts v. Baxter, 58 Miss., 329; Heirmann v. Stricklin, 60 Miss., 234.
The return-term is the first term after the summons has been legally executed. Story v. Ware, 35
Miss., 399.
If there be more than one defendant, then the first term after the last one is served is the appearanceterm, and that defendant cannot be forced to trial until the next term afterwards. Murray v. Bank, 5 Smed.
& M., 41; Thornton v. Fitzhugh, 10 Smed. & M., 438.
If the return-term fail, so that a court be not held at that term, it will nevertheless be the appearanceterm, and the case will stand for trial at the next term in the same way as though the appearance-term had
been regularly held. Thornton v. Fitzhugh, 10 Smed. & M., 438.
723 (1704). Affidavit for continuance.—On all applications for a continuance
the party shall set forth in his affidavit the facts which he expects to prove by his
absent witness or documents, that the court may judge of the materiality of such
facts.
724 (1705). Trial of facts by the court.—Trial by jury may be waived by the
parties to an issue of fact in actions on contract, and, with the assent of the court,
in other actions.
If a case be tried by the judge, his findings are regarded as equivalent to the verdict of a jury. Robert
son v. Cloud, 47 Miss., 208; Dixon v. Cook, 47 Miss., 220
725 (1707). Cases may be taken under advisement, etc. — The judge may
take a case under advisement until the next term. If an issue of fact be involved,
before taking it under advisement he shall, on notice to each party, cause the evi
dence on both sides to be reduced to writing and signed by him. At the next term
the judge shall deliver his opinion in writing, and the evidence and opinion shall
be a part of the record without a bill of exceptions; and either party prosecuting
an appeal may avail himself of all questions arising upon the record.
Motion for a new trial cannot be kept under advisement longer than the term next succeeding. The sec
tion does not apply to motions for new trials as to taking under advisement. (Ross v. Gary, 7 How. (Miss.),

726 (1706). Either party may appeal.—In cases tried by the court either party
may take bills of exception, and have an appeal, as in case of trial by jury.
In such case a motion for a new trial is not contemplated by the statute; the bill of exceptions must be
taken to the judgment. (Nicholson v. Karpe, 08 Miss., 34, explained.) Quinn v. Myles, 59 Miss., 375.
727 (1708). Trial by jury; peremptory challenges.—In civil suits each party

trial of any cause may be carried from the bar by the jury.
731 (1713). Interpreters. —Interpreters may be sworn truly to interpret, when
necessary; and in criminal cases the court may appoint an interpreter, and allow
him a reasonable compensation, not exceeding five dollars per day, payable out of
the county treasury.
732 (1714). * Instructions.—The judge in any cause, civil or criminal, shall not
sum up or comment on the testimony, or charge the jury as to the weight of
evidence; but at the request of either party he shall instruct the jury upon the
principles of law applicable to the case. All instructions asked by either party
must be in writing, and all alterations or modifications of instructions given by the
court or refused shall be in writing, and those given may be taken out by the jury
on its retirement. The clerk, before they are read or given to the jury, shall mark
all instructions asked by either party, or given by the court, as being "given" or
"refused," as the case may be, and all instructions so marked shall be a part of the
record, on appeal, without a bill of exceptions.
An instruction is erroneous if it assume as true a disputed fact of vital importance. Frenck v. Sale, 63
Miss., 386.
The supreme court will not notice requests for instructions unless exception be duly taken to the action
of the court below on them. Barney v. Scherling, 40 Miss., 320.
Under the statute the judge cannot invade the province of the jury by informing it. what weight should
or should not be given to established facts. Kearney v. The State, 68 Miss., 233.
Instructions when marked "given" or "refused" by the clerk, constitute a part of the record. Swan v.
West, 41 Miss., 104.
A circuit judge is denied the power of originating independent instructions not called for, or rendered
necessary by those requested by counsel. Watkins v. State, 60 Miss., 323.
The presiding judge is the source from which the law touching the case is to be supplied, and hp cannot
of his own motion give any instruction whatever; those given must be in writing, and at the request of the

An instruction on the weight of evidence is forbidden. French v. Sale, 63 Miss , 380. See further,

733 (1715). Bills of exception; in civil cases—If, on the trial of any cause
in the circuit court, either party shall be aggrieved by any charge or decision of
the court, such party may tender to the judge giving such charge or decision, a bill
of exceptions, stating therein the matters of law wherein he is supposed to have
erred, and the judge shall be bound to sign the same; and the bill of exceptions so
signed shall be made and considered a part of the record in the cause; and in case
the judge shall refuse to sign a bill of exceptions so tendered, if the facts therein
be truly stated, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor in office. (See § 555.)
The object of" a bill of exceptions is to put of record matters which transpire on the trial, and which ate
not of record proper. Vieksburg R. R. Co. v. Ragsdale, 51 Miss., 447.
The signing of a bill of exceptions is a ministerial act. VanBuren v. State, 24 Miss., 512. Vicksburg
R. R. Co. v. Ragsdale, 51 Miss., 447.
Bills of exceptions, if correct, must be signed by the judge when tendered, and if he refuse to sign them,
the signatures of two attorneys is the only remedy. (This seems to overrule the dicta in Williams v. Ram
sey, 52 Miss., 851.) Dreyfus v. Cage, 02 Miss., 605.
It is unnecessary, that it may become a part of the record, for a bill of exceptions to be marked "filed''
by the clerk; it becomes such by signature of the judge. Kimball v. Mitchell, 57 Miss., 632.
A statement in a bill of exceptions as to the time of its being signed, is conclusive, and can only be
impeached for fraud Kimball v. Mitchell, 57 Miss., 632.
After a bill of exceptions has been signed and delivered it cannot be amended or corrected. Bridges v.
Kuykendall, 58 Miss., 827; Dreyfus v. Cage, 62 Miss., 605.
Depositions in suits at law are not considered in the supreme court unless contained in a bill of excep
tions, even though they be filed and be referred to in a bill of exceptions. Giegolt v. Joor, 60 Miss., 817, and
cases cited.
A paper on file signed by the presiding judge, reciting what occurred during the progress of a trial and
an exception by defendant, but which was not prepared or tendered on behalf of the defendant, nor assented
to by him, is not a part of the record. Helm v. State, 66 Miss., 537.
734 (1716). In criminal cases.—On the trial of prosecutions for any crime or
misdemeanor, it shall be the duty of the judge to sign any bill of exceptions ten
dered by the defendant during the progress thereof, if the truth of the case be
fairly stated therein; and the said exceptions shall be a part of the record of such
prosecution.
735 (1718). When bill of exceptions signed.—Bills of exceptions to any rul
ing of the court, made before the jury retires from the box, must be tendered and
signed during the trial, or during the term of the court; and bills of exceptions to
judgments overruling motions for new trials must be presented to the judge for his
signature during the term or within ten days, or such further time, not exceeding
sixty days, as the court may allow, after the end of the term, and must be signed
promptly by him, if found to be correct; and if the death, resignation, or other inca
pacity of the judge should prevent him from signing a bill of exceptions, the affi
davit of the attorney of record who represented the party tendering the bill of
exceptions, and of all of them if more than one, that it correctly states the facts
and rulings of the court, shall be received as a substitute for the signature of the
judge to it; but in such case, if the appellee shall rile in the supreme court an affi
davit of himself or his attorney in the court below, that the bill of exceptions is
not correct, stating particularly wherein it is not correct, he may file any affidavits
other than his own touching the matter, and the opposite party may do likewise, up
to the time of the call of the case for trial in the supreme court; and said court
shall consider and determine, on submission of the case, both as to the truth of the
2(58

bill of exceptions and the questions involved in what the court may determine to
be the bill of exceptions. (See § 555.)

Saucier v. Amari, 63 Miss., 276.
The court has no power to extend the time further than authorized by the statute. Allen v. Lev}-, 59
Miss., 613.
736. Bills of exceptions in cases noted by a stenographer.—The preceding
provisions as to the time when bills of exceptions shall be presented and signed,
shall not apply to cases in which the evidence and proceedings arc noted down by
the stenographer; but bills of exceptions in such cases maybe presented and signed
at any time within sixty days after the end of the term of the court at which the
case was tried. The stenographer's copy of the evidence and proceedings in any
case, when certified, signed, and filed, shall be the basis of the bill of exceptions
therein; but such part of the interrogatories and evidence in the stenographer's
copy as are immaterial and do not support or tend to support, on either side, the
points of contention between the parties, should be left out of the bill of exceptions;
and when the stenographer shall have certified, signed, and filed his copy of the
evidence and proceedings, the party taking the appeal in the case may prepare a
draft of the bill of exceptions therefrom, as hereinbefore indicated, and he shall
deposit such draft thereof in the office of the clerk of the court, and notify the
adverse party thereof, or deliver the same to him, who shall, within ten days there
after, suggest in writing any objection thereto that he ma}- have, and deposit the
same in the office of the clerk and notify the party taking the appeal or deliver the
same to him; and after the expiration of the ten days, the party taking the appeal
may present to the judge of the court his draft of the bill of exceptions, with such
objections as may have been interposed by the adverse party, and the judge shall
promptly sign said draft of the bill of exceptions if correct, and, if not, he shall
promptly correct and sign the same, and when signed it shall be a part of the record
of the case. In case of the death of the stenographer before filing a copy of his
notes of the evidence and proceedings in any case, or of his failure to file the same
within forty days after the end of the term of court, the party taking the appeal
may prepare and present to the judge a bill of exceptions in the case as if there
bad not been a stenographer therein, and the judge may sign the same within sixty
days after the end of the term, and it shall be his duty to do so if the same be
correct. (See § 555.)
737 (1717). When attorneys may sign.—If the judge shall refuse to sign a
bill of exceptions to an opinion, decision, or charge given or made on the trial of
any cause or motion, when the bill of exceptions is tendered to him, it shall be law
ful for two attorneys at law who may be present at the time of the giving or mak
ing of such opinion, decision, or charge, and of the refusal of the judge to sign
such bill of exceptions, to sign the same; and the bill of exceptions so signed shall
have the same force and effect as if it had been signed by the judge. (See § 555.)
If the bill of exceptions slate that the judge who tried the cause refused to sign it, and that the two per
sons who did sign were attorneys, and present, etc., it is sufficient. Rawls v. State, 8 Smed. & M., 599.

738 (1710). New trials; on terms, and only two to same party.—Every new
trial granted shall be on such terms as the court shall direct; and no more than
two new trials shall be granted to the same party in any cause.
Statute applied. Munn v. Perkins, 1 Sined. k M., 412.
Where three successive verdicts are found against a party, and two new trials are granted him, the circuit
court has not authority to entertain a motion for a third new trial by the same party. Kay v. McCary, 26
Miss., 404; Thornton v. West R. R. Co., 29 Miss , 143; Strickland v. Hudson, 55 Miss., 235; Tagert v. Baker,
57 Miss., 303.
But the prohibition of the statute does not apply where the. record shows a bill of exceptions, taken in
due form pending the trial, to the rulings of the court upon points of evidence and instructions. Ray v.
McCary, 2G Miss., 404; Thornton v. West R. R. Co., 29 Mis*., 143; Garnett v. Kirkman, 33 Miss., 389; Bow
ers v. Ross, 55 Miss., 213; Strickland v. Hudson, 55 Miss., 235: Parham v. Stith, 61 Miss., 199.
The statute does not apply where there had not been two new trials granted to the same party. Wildy
v. Bonney, 35 Miss., 77.
If, without error of law in three trials, new trials be granted because of the jury's incorrect conclusions
of fact, the order granting the last new trial is void. Tagert v. Baker, 57 Miss., 303.
739 (1720). The same; granting or refusing assignable for error.—When a
motion for a new trial shall be granted or refused, either party may reduce to writ
ing the reasons offered for said new trial, together with the substance of the evi
dence in the case, and also the decision of the court on said motion, and tender
the same as a bill of exceptions; and it shall be the duty of the judge to allow and
sign the same; and such bill of exceptions shall be a part of the record in the cause,
and it may embrace the motion, the judgment, or other matters of record; and the
appellant may assign for error that the court below improperly granted or refused
a new trial.
After a new trial has been granted, and before had in the court below, it is premature to appeal from the
order granting the same. ( See, for an exception, Tagert v. Baker, 57 Miss., 303.) Terry v. Robins, 5 Smed.
& M., 291.
The court will consider only such written reasons as are assigned in the motion for a new trial. Barney
v. Scherling, 40 Miss., 320.
The bill of exceptions must be signed by the regular judge, even though a special judge ac tually preside
on the trial. Rankin v. Johnson, 56 Miss., 125.
740 (1721). Non-suit or dismissal; before jury retire from bar. —Every
plaintiff desiring to suffer a non-suit on trial shall be barred therefrom unless he
do so before the jury retire to consider of its verdict.
741 (1722). Same; in vacation. —The plaintiff may suffer a non-suit, or dismiss
any cause, before the clerk in vacation, on paying all costs that have accrued; and
the clerk shall enter on the declaration the disposition made of the same, with the
date. Where the plaintiff has received satisfaction of the cause of action in vaca
tion, he shall, by himself or his attorney, enter such satisfaction on the declaration,
and sign the same; and where the plaintiff suffers a non-suit, or dismisses his suit,
without having received satisfaction, he shall stand in the same situation as though
he had never instituted suit; but, if the defendant have pleaded or filed a set-off,
he may elect to proceed on such counter claim as a plaintiff, with all the rights of
a plaintiff, as against the party who has suffered a non-suit or dismissed his cause,
whether in term-time or vacation, and may have a trial, ami judgment if he main
tain his demand.
742 (1723). Trial by referees. —All the issues in an action, whether of fact or
law, may be referred to one or more referees, not exceeding three, upon the consent
of the parties. (For arbitration and award, see §§ 95-113.)
The court cannot, in the absence of fraud, compel the referees to embody the evidence heard by them in
their report. Anding v. Levy, 60 Miss , 487.
270

CIRCUIT COURTS.

'743-746

743 (1724). The same; cause involving matters of account.—In all cases in
which matters of account are in controversy, the court may, on the application of
either party, direct a reference to one or more competent persons, not exceeding
three, as referees, to state and report an account "between the parties, and the amount
that may be due from either party to the other, which report, when confirmed by
the court, shall be final and conclusive between the parties, and judgment shall be
entered thereon ; but either party may, at the time of ordering the reference, enter
his dissent therefrom, and, during the term to which the report is filed, may demand
a trial by jury, in which case the cause shall be so tried, the costs of the reference
to abide the result ; and upon such trial the report of the referees shall be prima
facie evidence of all the matters therein found and reported; and at the time of
demanding the trial by jury, the party shall file his exceptions to the report, and
matters not excepted to shall be treated as true on the trial. Either party may
move for a new trial, take bills of exceptions, and have an appeal, as in other cases.
An action on a tax-collector's bond to recover a balance due the county and shown by a statement of his
accounts for two years, is within the statute. Marlar v. State, 62 Miss., 677.
Where a party enters his dissent, and, at the same term at which the report is made, demands a trial by
jury, and excepts to the report, it is error to confirm the report and refuse the jury trial, even where the
demand is not made until alter the commencement of argument on a motion to confirm the report. Alarlar
•v. State, 62 Miss., 677.
744 (1725). The same; exceptions to report of referees.—Either party, with
out having demanded a trial by jury, may file exceptions to the report of the ref
erees; and the court shall hear and determine the same, and may set aside the
report and direct another reference to the same or other referees. Bills of excep
tions may be taken, and, after final judgment, an appeal may be prosecuted as in
other cases.
745 (1726). The same; powers of referees.—Referees shall have power to ad
minister oaths, and to issue subpoenas for witnesses, and to compel their attendance,
in cases referred to them.
746 (1727). Jeofails; what cured hy verdict.—A judgment shall not be
stayed or reversed, after verdict, for any defect in the writ; or for a variance in the
writ from the declaration or other proceedings; or for any mispleading, insufficient
pleading, discontinuance, misjoining of issue, failure to join issue, or lack of war
rant of attorney; or for the appearance of either party, being under the age of
twenty-one years, by attorney, if the verdict be for him and not to his prejudice;
or for not alleging any deed, letters testamentary, or of administration, to be
brought into court; or for the omission of the words "with force and arms," or
"against the peace;" or for any misstatement of the Christian name, or surname
of either party, sum of money, quantity of merchandise, value, day, month, or
year, in the declaration or pleading, the name, sum, quantity, value, or time, being
right in any other part of the record or proceedings; or for the omission of the
averment, " this he is ready to verify," or " this he is ready to verify by the record ; "
or for not alleging "as appeareth by the record;" or for omitting the averment of
any matter without proving which the jury ought not to have given such verdict;
■or for setting forth by way of recital any matter which ought to have been set forth
by averment; or for not alleging that the suit or matter is within the jurisdiction
of the court ; or for not alleging that the property in the declaration mentioned is

CIRCUIT COURTS.

the property of the plaintiff; or for any mistake or misconception of the form of
the -action, or for any other defect of form in the declaration or pleading; or for
any informality in entering the judgment. Xeither shall judgment by default be
reversed, nor a judgment after inquiry of damages be stayed or reversed, for any
omission or fault which would not have been good cause to stay or reverse the judg
ment if there had been a verdict on issue joined.
Defects in the declaration are cured after judgment bv default Ragsdale v. Caldwell, 2 How. (Miss. ),
930; Wells v. Woodley, 5 How. (Miss.), 484; Breck v. Smith, 44 Miss., 69U.
Where the declaration does not stute sufficiently a case against the defendant, and he does not demur but
takes issue, a verdict and judgment against him will cure the defect in the declaration; but the judgment
will be reversed if the evidence in a bill of exceptions be insufficient to sustain it. Reaves v. Dennis, 6 Smed.
& M., 89.
Such a defect will be cured by verdict and judgment, where the proof supplies the omission in the plead
ing. Clark v. Reed, 12 Smed. & M., 554.
Where the declaration omitted material averments, and was not demurred to. after verdict and judgment,
it will be presumed that the evidence justified the judgment, in the absence of bill of exceptions showing the
contrary. Gale v. Lancaster, 44 Miss., 413.
The statute does not extend to a case where the declaration does not state a cause of action, or where it
shows that the plaintiff has no right to the action. Wells v. Woodley, 5 How. (Miss.), 4S4; Haynes v. Ezell,
25 Miss., 242; Gale v. Lancaster, 44 Miss.. 413.
If a trial of the right of property be had without a formal issue, which was not objected to, after verdict
and judgment, the defect is cured. Phillips v. Cooper, 50 Miss., 722.
If objection to defects in the pleadings and proceedings be not made at the proper time, it will be too
late, after verdict and judgment, to object thereto. Grubbs v. Collins, 54 Miss , 4S5; Trustees v. Gilman, 55
Miss., 148; Noble v. Terrell, 64 Miss., 830.
As to discontinuances, the statute relates solely to technical discontinuances by the common law, and
not to orders of the court dismissing causes. American Co. v. Shaughnessy, 59 Miss., 398.
A verdict and judgment will cure the omission of only those averments that are necessary to make the
case attempted to be stated in the declaration, and will not supply a new and distinct cause of action not stated.
Hamer v. Higby, 05 Miss., 41.
One who has, in writing, assigned an account, cannot maintain an action thereon in his own name, even
for the use of the assignee; and a judgment by default in such case will not cure the defect. Beck v. Rosser.
68 Miss., 72.
747 (1728). Judgment on confession a release of errors. —A judgment on
confession shall be equal to a release of all errors; but all powers of attorney for
confessing or suffering judgment to pass by default or otherwise, and all general
releases of error made or to be made by any person before action brought, shall
be absolutely null and void.
The statute will not prohibit an appeal from a confessed judgment rendered by a justice of the peace.
James v. Woods, 65 Miss., 528.
748 (1729). Remedial orders. —In all actions in which the right to real or
personal estate is in controversy, the court or the judge thereof may make an
order for the protection of the property in controversy from waste or destruction,
and to prevent the removal of personal property beyond the jurisdiction of the
court, upon satisfactory proof being made of the necessity for such order., and may
enforce such order by an attachment for contempt and other proper process; but in
all such cases the court or judge may require a bond of the party applying for the
order, in an adequate penalty, payable to the opposite party, with sufficient sureties,
to be approved by the court or judge, conditioned to pay all such damages as may
be suffered by reason of such order in case the principal obligor be cast in the suit.
(See §2854.)"
749 (1730). Of judgments; when final. —In actions founded on an instrument
of writing showing the sum due, or on open account, where a copy of the account
is filed with the declaration, if judgment be rendered on demurrer, by confession,
272

CIRCUIT COURTS.

750-753

or by default, the clerk shall calculate the amount due for principal and interest,
and judgment shall he entered therefor and be final, if not set aside during the
term. And in all actions where the sum due does not so appear, and in all actions
sounding in damages, if the defendant do not plead, interlocutor}' judgments may
be taken, on which writs of inquiry shall be awarded, which may be executed at the
same term by the jurors attending court. And after a writ of inquiry shall be
executed, and judgment rendered thereon by the court, the same shall not be set
aside unless good cause be shown therefor on oath ; and in such case the defendant
shall plead immediately, and the plaintiff shall not thereby be delayed of his trial.
In actions for money paid, a judgment final by default is erroneous, unless a bill of particulars be filed
with the declaration. Barker v. Justice, 41 Mis?., 240.
A judgment by default, before writ of inquiry is executed, may be set aside at discretion ; Taut afterwards
only on cause shown under oath. Porter v Johnson, 2 How. (Miss ), 736; Barker v. Justice, 41 Miss., 240;
Meridian v. Trussell, 52 Miss., 711.
A final judgment without an inquiry is allowed only in an action ex contractu. Mississippi R. R. Co. v.
Fort, 44 Miss., 423.
In an action on a tax-collector's bond, if a plea be not filed, a writ of inquiry should be awarded. Boykin v. State, 50 Miss., 375.
750 (1731). Judgment on bonds for money. —In an action brought upon a
bond for the payment of money, wherein the plaintiff shall recover, judgment shall
be entered for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the payment of the
principal and interest due and the costs of suit, and execution shall issue accord
ingly; or if before judgment the defendant shall bring into court the principal and
interest due upon the bond, he shall be discharged, and in that case judgment shall
be entered for the costs only.
751 (1732). Judgment according to the rights of parties.—Judgments may be
rendered for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, or for or against one or
more of several defendants; and in such cases the verdict shall be as the right may
appear among the several parties to the action, and shall state separately any
amount allowed to any of the parties.
Where two partners are sued jointly and separate judgments rendered against them, and one appeals, he
cannot complain of errors against the other. Lynch v. Thompson, 61 Miss., 354.
The object of the statute is only to provide that appropriate judgments may be rendered on issues prop
erly determinable in the form of action tried. Lynch v. Thompson, 61 Miss., 354; Dreyfus v. Cage. 62
Miss., 733.
752 (1733). As many verdicts and judgments as necessary.— Such and so
many verdicts and judgments—joint, separate, and cross—as may be necessary to
the adjustment of the rights of the several parties may be rendered in the same
action.

to another in any sum of money within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, on any
promise, agreement, or covenant, may sign an office confession of judgment in the

which remains due and unpaid, and that said sum of money is not due or claimed
upon a fraudulent or usurious consideration.
(Signed) —

" Sworn to and subscribed the

"<

And if the evidence of the debt be in writing, the same shall be filed with said
statement; and if not in writing, then a copy of the open account shall be filed;
and the party indebted shall sign, before the clerk, an acknowledgment written
upon or annexed to said statement, to the effect following, to wit:
" I do hereby acknowledge myself indebted to the said
in the sum of
dollars, which includes interest up to the first day of the next term of the said circuit
court, and I give my consent for judgment to be rendered against me in favor of said
, at the next term of the said circuit court, for said amount and all legal costs
accruing thereon, with stay of execution [if any] until [as may be agreed upon].
(i
"Taken and acknowledged the

"
, Clerk."
The fact that a note on which judgment was confessed was not due when the judgment was rendered,
does nut deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction. Black v. Pattison, 61 Miss., 599.
754 (1735). The same; docketed and made final. —When such statement and
acknowledgment are filed, the clerk shall docket the cause on the appearance-docket,
and at the next term, on the motion of the plaintiff, the court shall render judgment
thereon for the amount acknowledged to be due, with interest from the first day of
the term, and with such stay of execution, if any, as may be stipulated : and such
judgment shall be final unless set aside during the term, and shall be as binding'and
obligatory as judgment rendered in any other form; and a full and complete final
record shall be made therein as in other cases.
The lien of such judgment only takes effect from confirmation. Bass v. Estill, 50 Miss., 300.
755. The same; absolutely void in certain cases.—A judgment rendered on
office confession shall be void in toto as to third parties, if tainted with fraud or
usury.
756 (1736). Enrollment of judgments; judgment-roll.—The clerk of the cir
cuit court shall procure and keep in his office one or more books, to be styled '-The
Judgment Roll," which books shall be appropriately divided under the several letters
of the alphabet, and on each page shall be placed the following caption:

said judgment, the amount of such judgment, the date of its rendition, the county
and court in which rendered, the date of enrollment, and the names of the plaintiff'
274

CIRCUIT COURTS.

757-758

or plaintiffs. When any judgment shall be satisfied, the deck] shall so enter under
the proper heading, and subscribe the entry.
The enrollment of a judgment against two persons, partners, under the letter of tlie name of one only,
does not bind the property of the other. Hughes v. Lacock, 03 Miss., 1 12.
757 (1737). Lien of enrolled judgments. —A judgment so enrolled shall he a
lien upon and bind all the property of the defendant within the county where so
enrolled, from the rendition thereof, and, shall have priority according to the order
of such enrollment, in favor of the judgment-creditor, his representatives or assigns,
against the judgment-debtor, and all persons claiming the property under him after
the rendition of the judgment ; and a judgment shall not be a lien on any property
of the defendant thereto unless the same be enrolled.
Where several judgments are rendered against a defendant on the same day, the judgment which appears
first entered on the minutes of the court obtains a prior lien. Smith v. Shipp, 1 How. (Miss.), 234; Reed v.
Haviland, 38 Miss., 323; Johnson v. Edde, 58 Miss., 664.
If a creditor suspend his execution he loses his priority of lien. Michie v. Planters' Bank. 4 How.
(Miss.), 139; Smith v. Everly, 4 How. (Miss.), 178.
And this is true if the stay be granted by the judgment itself. (Pickett v. Doe, etc., 5 Smed. & M., 470,
overruled.) Virden v. Robinson, 59 Miss., 28.
The judgment, if enrolled, becomes a lien on after-acquired property from the date of its acquisition.
( Moody v. Harper, 25 Miss., 484, explained.) Jenkins v. Gowan, 37 Mies., 444; Cayce v. Stovall, 50 Miss., 396 ;
Cooper v. Turnage, 52 Miss., 431.
The lien extends to the money produced by sale under execution as well as to the property sold. Smith
v. Everly, 4 How (Miss.), 178.
A judgment of affirmance in supreme court neither satisfies, merges, or extinguishes the judgment
below; and though it be a judgment on the appeal-bond against the principal and his sureties, it does not
extinguish or destroy the lien of the original judgment. Planters' Bank v. Calvit, 3 Smed.it M., 143; Kilpatrick v. Dye, 4 Smed. & M.. 289; Montgomery v. McGimsey, 7 Smed. cfe M., 557.
The removal of property out of the county after the lien has attached does not destroy it. Chilton v.
Cox, 7 Smed. & M., 791.
The lien of a judgment, in a contest between the judgment-creditor and a purchaser from the judgmentdebtor, takes effect from the rendition of the judgment by the judge, and not from the time of signing the
minutes. Clark v. Duke, 59 Miss., 575.
The object of enrollment is to protect the rights of persons who should become purchasers. Josselyn v.
Stone, 28 Miss., 753.
The rights of the state are not affected by the enrollment laws. Josselyn v. Stone, 28 Miss., 753.
A judgment-creditor takes in execution the property of his debtor subject to every liability under which
the debtor himself held it at the time of the rendition of the judgment, and subject to all equities which
exist at the time in favor of third persons, except where otherwise provided by statute. Walton v. Hargroves,
42 Miss., 18; Foute v. Fail-man, 48 Miss., 536.
See as an exception Nugent v. Priebatsch, 01 Miss., 402.
The lien of a judgment duly enrolled binds the property in the hands of a subvendee or more remote
purchaser from the defendant. Mitchell v. Wood, 47 Miss., 231.
The lien can attach to money only from its seizure. Calm v. Person, 56 Miss., 360.
The statute only relates to judgments against the defendant from whom the money has been collected;
and applies only to money made by a sale under execution. Johnson v. Edde, 58 Miss., 664.
Where a creditor refuses to give an indemnifying bond, and another creditor does give it, and a sale is
made because thereof, the latter will have a superior right to the proceeds. Townsend v. Henry, 26 Miss.,
203; Dabney v. Stackhouse, 49 Miss., 513.
758 (1737). How priority, of right forfeited.—A junior judgment-creditor may
give witten notice to any senior judgment-creditor requiring him to execute his judg
ment; and if the senior judgment-creditor, being so notified, shall fail, neglect, or
refuse to have execution issued and levied within ten days from said notice for the
satisfaction of his judgment, he shall lose his priority, and the junior judgmentcreditor may cause execution to issue on his judgment and to be levied on any of
the property of the defendant, and the proceeds of a sale thereof shall be applied
to the junior judgment so levied.
The section applies to living plaintiffs, who can legally enforce their judgments. Dibble v. Norton, 44
Miss., 158.
275

759-764

CIRCUIT COURTS.

The junior creditor having given the notice, and the senior having failed to do as required of him, the
former has a prior lien. Curry v. Lampkin, 51 Miss., 91.
759 (1738). Judgment not a lien out of county unless enrolled.— A judg
ment or decree rendered in auy court of the United States or of this state shall
not be a lion upon or bind auy property of the defendant, situated out of the county
in which such judgment or decree was rendered, until the plaintiff shall file in
the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which such property
may be situated an abstract of such judgment or decree, certified by the clerk of
the court in which the same was rendered, containing the names of all the parties
to such judgment or decree, its amount, and the date of the rendition, and the
amount appearing to have been paid thereon, if any; and it shall be the duty of
the clerk of the circuit court, on receiving such abstract, and on payment of the
fees allowed by law for filing and enrolling the same, to file and forthwith enroll
the same on the judgment-roll, as in other cases; and such judgment or decree
shall, from the date of its enrollment^ be a lien upon and bind the property of the
defendants within the county where it shall be so enrolled.
A. judgment does not become a lien until an abstract therpof be filed and the judgment be enrolled, and
the lien has priorilv from the time of the filing and enrolling. Bergen v. State, 58 Miss., d'2'i; Hamilton v.
Walker, 67 Miss., 197.
760 (1739). No lien in county without enrollment.—Judgments and decrees,
at law or in equity, rendered in any court of the United States held within this
state, or in the supreme court or the courts of chancery of this state, shall not be a
lien upon or bind the property of the defendants within the county in which such
judgments or decrees maybe rendered, until an abstract thereof shall be filed in the
office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county and enrolled on the judgmentroll, in the manner and on the terms hereinbefore provided; and such judgments
and decrees shall bind the property of the defendants from the date of such enroll
ment, in like manner as judgments and decrees rendered in a different county and
so enrolled.
761 (1764). Growing crop not subject to judgment-lien.— A growing crop
shall not be subject to the lien of a judgment. (See § 3472.)
762 (1741). Scire facias on judgment after year and day.—It shall not be
necessary to revive a judgment by scire facias, because no execution shall have been
issued on such judgment, within a year and a day after its rendition, but execution
may be issued without such revival.
763 (1756). Of supersedeas.—Supersedeas shall not be granted to stay the exe
cution of any judgment, except upon condition that the party obtaining it shall
undertake in writing, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the judge who
grants or the clerk who issues the writ of supersedeas, to pay the full amount of
the judgment superseded, with interest and costs, if said supersedeas shall be dis
charged; and when such supersedeas shall be discharged, such undertaking shall
have the force and effect of a judgment of the court whose judgment was super
seded, against all the parties thereto, and may be enforced against them or the rep
resentatives of any who may have died, as any other judgment of such court; but
this shall not apply to supersedeas on appeal.
764 (1785). Collection of fines, penalties, etc., and list reported.—The clerk
of the circuit court shall, immediately after the adjournment of every term, issue
276

and remaining due and unpaid; and shall, within thirty days after such adjournment,
transmit a list of said executions to the clerk of the board of supervisors of the
county', noting the names of the defendants, the amounts, and the sheriff or other

as required, shall forfeit and pay the sum of two hundred dollars for every such
offense, to be recovered by the state or county, on motion against him and his sure
ties by the district attorney, before the circuit court. The clerk of the board of
supervisors shall notify the district attorney of such default.
765. (1786). Remedy against officer, in reference to fines.—If any sheriff or
other officer shall return on any such writ of execution, that he hath levied the
fine, penalty, or forfeiture therein mentioned, or any part thereof; or, that he hath
taken the' body of the defendant, and shall have suffered such defendant to escape ;
or, if any person be committed to the custody of such sheriff or other officer until
the fine, penalty, or forfeiture for which he was committed shall be paid, and such
sheriff or officer shall permit such defendant to escape ; or, if such sheriff or officer
shall have received such fine, penalty, or forfeiture, or any part thereof, and shall
not immediately account to the clerk of the board of supervisors and pay the same
into the treasury of the county, then, in either of the cases above specified, it shall
be the duty of said clerk to notify the district attorney of such default, who shall
thereupon, on motion at the next term of the circuit court, demand judgmentagainst such sheriff, or other officer, and his sureties, for the fines, penalties, and
forfeitures mentioned in such writs, or for so much thereof as he shall have received
on such execution or commitment, or the whole amount thereof in case he shall have
suffered such defendant or defendants to escape; and the court shall give judgment

914 (2265). No discontinuance for certain things. —If any court shall not be
held at any term, or shall not continue to sit the whole term, or during the term

court, or such part thereof as may be necessary, where such suit may be pending;
and the judge or chancellor so notified shall attend and hold such term, if the same

The functions of the member of the bar agreed upon to try a cause are ministerial rather than judicial,
his decree having no validity until signed by the judge or chancellor. Grinstead v. Buckley, 32 Miss., 148.

the same manner and with the like effect as if the stated term had not expired.
There can be no ending of a term when a trial is entered upon and is not completed. The expiration of

Whenever an officer is confined in the execution of his duties to a particular territory, all of his official
acts must show upon their face that they were performed within such territorj-. Saunders v. Erwin, 2 How.

witnesses, or one witness and corroborating circumstances, to overthrow the answer sworn to, as would be

Miss., 500.
Where a bill in chancery is sworn to by the attorney, the affidavit must be special, stating whether the

ferred, taking the receipt of the clerk therefor.
937. Proceedings in such causes.—When the papers have been deposited in
the court to which the cause was transferred, all the parties to the proceeding shall
take notice of the fact of the transfer; and the complainant or plaintiff shall file
his declaration or bill in the court to which the cause was transferred within thirty
days, unless the court, judge, or chancellor shall restrict the time or grant further
time; and the defendant shall plead within thirty days thereafter, unless the time,
by like means, be restricted or extended. And the cause shall be proceeded with as
if it had been originally begun in that court, as of the date on which the cause was
originally instituted.
938. Costs in such causes.—The complainant or plaintiff in the first court shall
pay all the costs in such court; but he may recover the same of the defendant, in
the court to which the cause was transferred, at the discretion of the court.
939 (2296). Courts to take notice of law of other states.— When any question
shall arise as to the law of the United States, or of any other state or territory of
the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or of any foreign country, the
court shall take notice of such law in the same matyier as if the question arose
under the law of this state.
940 (2298). Errors in judgments, etc.; how corrected, etc. — Where, in the
record of a judgment or decree of any court of law or equity, there shall be a mis

any verdict, bond, bill, note, or other writing of the like nature or kind, or docket
or other memoranda by the judge or chancellor, whereby such judgment or decree
may be safely amended, it shall be the duty of the court, and of the judge thereof
in vacation, to amend such judgment or decree thereby according to the truth, but
the opposite party shall have reasonable notice of the application for the amend
ment. And if the transcript of such judgment or decree at the time of the amend
ment, or at any time thereafter, be removed to the supreme court, it shall be the
duty of that court, upon the inspection o'f such amended record, to be brought
before it by certiorari if need be, to affirm the judgment if there be no other error
apparent on the record.
There is no limit of time within which an amendment may be applied for and made. If a party appear,
he cannot object for want of proper notice. An amendment cannot afterwards be set aside without notice to
the adverse party. Graves v. Fulton, 7 How. (Miss.), ;V.12 ; Healey v. Just, 53 Miss., 547.

COURTS, PROVISIONS COMMON TO.

941-944

The statute applies solely to the correction of judgments and decrees, and cannot be extended so as to
supply a judgment never rendered. Ralph v. Preston, 28 Miss., 744.
The record of an amendment must show that the notice was given. Shirle3T v. Conway, 44 Miss., 434.
The exercise of the power by amending as to one joint defendant does not affect the right to amend as to
others. Healey v. Just, 53 Miss., 547.
An appeal is barred if two 3'ears have elapsed from the rendition of the judgment, though an amendment
iiave been made within that time. Healey v. Just, 53 Miss., 547.
The statute does not apply to criminal cases. McCarthy v. State, 56 Miss., 294.
941 (2299, 2300). Excess remitted.—Where any bond, taken by virtue of any
process or order, by miscalculation or mistake, shall be conditioned for the payment
of a larger sum of money than by law ought to have been required thereby, and a
verdict shall have been rendered thereon for the larger sum, or where a verdict
shall be rendered for more damages than the plaintiff shall have demanded by his
suit, and judgment be rendered accordingly, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff, at
the same or any future term of the court, to release in open court any such excess;
or he may in vacation release the same, in writing under his hand, and file it among
the papers of the cause; and such release shall cure any error growing out of the
excess. If the record of any such judgment be removed to an appellate court before
the release be made, it shall be competent for the appellee to make such release in
the appellate court; and thereupon, the court, after reversing the judgment, shall
proceed to give such judgment as the court below ought to have given if the release
had been filed therein; but in such case the appellee shall pay the costs, and the
judgment shall not be entered against the sureties in the appeal-bond.
942 (2301). Proceedings on death of surety on bonds, etc. —If any surety on
a bond, recognizance, or undertaking of any kind given in any legal proceeding,
shall be dead at the time for judgment to be rendered or execution to be issued
thereon, that shall not prevent judgment from being rendered or execution being

may be issued on such judgment against the living parties, and after the absolute
judgment against the personal representatives, execution may be issued against
them to enforce it.
943 (2302). Death, of parties on bonds having force of judgment.—Where
execution may be issued on any bond or undertaking, and some of the parties are
dead, it may be issued separately against such as are alive, and citation may be
issued to the personal representatives of such as are dead, to show cause against the
issuance of execution against them on such bond or undertaking ; and on the return
of such citation executed, if no sufficient cause be shown against it, execution may
be issued against them.
944 (2303). The same; citation in anticipation of judgment.—Citation to

ing possession or control of the obligation, to submit to judgment or execution

and be subject to judgment in his favor, no matter to whom it is made payable, nor
what is its amount, nor how it is conditioned ; and the persons executing such bond
or other undertaking shall be bound thereon and thereby, and shall be liable to
judgment or decree on such bond or undertaking as if it were payable and condi
tioned in all respects as prescribed by law, if such bond or other obligation or
undertaking had the effect in such proceeding or matter which a bond or other
undertaking, payable and conditioned as prescribed by law, would have had; and
where any such bond or undertaking is not for any specified sum, it shall bind the
parties executing it for the full amount for which any bond or undertaking might
have been required in the state of case in which it was given. (For like provisions
applicable to official bonds, see §3076.)
The statute does not apply where a defendant in execution pave a bond to have the proceeds of property
levied on forthcoming. Such a bond is unauthorized; and in such case it makes no difference that another
made a claimant's issue, the court will treat the officer as having the money in his hands. Carothers v. Leigh,
60 Miss., 258.
The obligors in a bond given in a replevin suit cannot, under the statute, object to judgment against
them because the form of the bond be the one appropriate lor a claimant's issue. Clark v. Clinton, 61 Miss., 337.

court, in all cases not specially provided for by statute, may require any bond,
recognizance, obligation, or undertaking of any kind in any legal proceeding, of
which the court has cognizance, which is shown to be insufficient, to be substituted
by a new one, with sufficient sureties ; and for a failure to comply with the order of
the court or judge in the matter, the court or judge may make such order as may be
proper in the case, and may direct such process as may be necessary or proper to
enforce it; but notwithstanding the discharge of a supersedeas, injunction, attach
ment, or other process in consequence of such failure, a judgment or decree may be
given on the bond or other obligation, or liability on it may be enforced by action

or otherwise, as if it had not been held to be insufficient ; but, if done in vacation,
five days' notice of the time and place of making application for the order shall be
given to the opposite party; and in all cases reasonable time shall be allowed for
giving new bond, upon such terms as the court or judge may prescribe. A new
bond given in any such case shall be cumulative security.

CHAPTER 29.
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
949 (2697). Abduction of females. —Every person who shall take any female
over the age of fourteen years unlawfully, against her will, and by force, menace,
fraud, deceit, stratagem, or duress, compel or induce her to jnarry him, or to marry
any other person, or to be defiled, and shall be thereof duly convicted, shall be
punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than five years nor more
than fifteen years.
950 (2698). Accessories; before the fact.^-Every person who shall be an
accessory to any felony, before the fact, shall be deemed and considered a principal,
and shall be indicted and punished as such ; and this, whether the principal have
been previously convicted or not.
Presence and intention to aid is participation. McCarthy v. State, 26 Miss., 299; Hogsett v. State, 40
Miss., 522.
An accessory before the fact is one who is not present at the time of the commission of the offense, but
counsels, procures, or commands the commission of the crime. Unger v. State, 42 Miss., 642.
If the intent be to kill one person, and the principal, by mistake, kill another, this will not be a defense
to the accessory. Wynn v. State, 63 Miss., 260.
'
951 (2699). The same; after the fact.—Every person who shall be convicted of
having concealed, received, or relieved any felon, or having aided or assisted any
felon, knowing that such person had committed a felony, with intent to enable
such felon to escape or to avoid arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment after the
commission of such felony, on conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned in the peni
tentiary not exceeding five years, or in the county jail not exceeding one year, or
by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by both ; and in prosecutions for such
offenses it shall not be necessary to aver in the indictment or prove on the trial that
the principal has been convicted or tried.
To constitute an accessory after the fact, the aid and assistance must be given after the felony is fully
completed. Hence, a party rendering assistance to one after the mortal blow, and before death of the victim,
can only be convicted as an accessory after the fact to the crime of assault and battery with intent to kill.
Harrel v. State, 39 Miss., 702.
On the trial of an accessory, the admissions of the principal are good only to establish his own guilt.
Lynes v. State, 36 Miss., 617.
And on such trial, the record of the conviction of the principal is evidence to prove that conviction and
all its legal consequences, though not evidence of the guilt of the prisoner. Keithler v. State, 10 Smed. &
M., 192.
952 (2744). Adulteration of food, drugs, candy, confects, and sweetmeats.—
If any person shall manufacture, sell, or keep or offer or exhibit for sale any adul
terated food or drug, as. defined by law ; or if any person shall manufacture, sell, or
311

1734~I738

EVIDENCE.

any person who will sue for the same, and shall also be liable in damages to the
party injured ; and when any person employed in driving stock shall violate the
provisions of this section, he and his employer shall be liable to the like penalties ;
but the recovery of such penalty shall not be a bar to indictment for larceny.
1734 (912). Stallion suffered to run at large may be gelded.—If any person
shall suffer any stallion above the age of two years to run at large, out of an inclosure, it shall be lawful for any person to confine and geld such stallion, at the risk
of the owner; but this section shall not apply to such stallions as are usually kept
up, and happen to get out by accident.
1735 (913). Marks and brands of animals.—Every person owning any cattle
or stock may have a brand or ear-mark, which shall be recorded in the office of the
clerk of the chancery court of the county where such cattle or other stock may he,
and such person shall have the exclusive right to the brand or mark from the date
of recording.
1736 (914). How dispute about brands and marks settled.—When any dis
pute shall arise respecting the right of a brand or mark, either party may apply to
a justice of the peace, who shall hear the complaint as in other cases, and give
judgment thereon, which shall be conclusive on the parties ; and a transcript thereof,
certified by the justice, shall be sufficient authority for the clerk to record the brand
or mark.

CHAPTER 43.
EVIDENCE.
1737 (1648). Presumption of death.—Any person who shall remain beyond
the sea, or absent himself from this state, or conceal himself in this state, for seven
years successively without being heard of, shall be presumed to be dead in any case
where his death shall come in question, unless proof be made that he was alive
within that time; but any property or estate recovered in any such case shall be
restored to the person evicted or deprived thereof, if, in a subsequent action, it shall
be proved that the person so presumed to be dead is living. •
The presumption of the death of a husband or wife authorized by the statute will be applied in favor of
the validity of a marriage contracted by the abandoned party after the expiration of the seven years. Spears
v. Burton, 31 Miss., 547; Gibson v. State, 38 Miss., 313.
The uncontradicted testimony of the mother that the last she ever heard of her son was that ten years
before, he sailed on board a vessel for a foreign port, and that about five days afterwards there was a storm at
sea, and that neither the ship nor any one on board has ever been heard of since, and that she is satisfied
her son is dead, fully establishes the presumption of death authorized by the statute. Learned v. Corley, 43
Miss., 687.
1738 (1599). Competency of witnesses. —Every person, whether a party to the
suit or not, shall be competent to give evidence in any suit at law or in equity, and
shall not be incompetent by reason of any interest in the result thereof, or in the
record as an instrument of evidence in other suits; and such weight shall be given
to the evidence of parties and interested witnesses as, in view of the situation of
the witness and other circumstances, it may be fairly entitled to. Any party may,
454

EVIDENCE.

1 739- 1 740

by subpoena, as in -other cases, compel any other party to the suit to appear and
give evidence.
' It is error to instruct the jury that "if an interested witness be uncontradicted, and the jury see nothing
in his mode of testifying, his position in the case, and his demeanor on the stand, to excite suspicion, they are
bound to believe him." Allen v. Lyles, 35 Miss., 513.
1739 (1601). Husband and wife introduced by each other, etc.— Husband
and wife may be introduced by each other as witnesses in all cases, civil or criminal,
and shall be competent witnesses in their own behalf, as against each other, in all
controversies between them. (See § 1571.)
A wife is not a competent witness against her husband who is on trial for crime. Byrd v. State, 57
Miss., 243.
But she is competent if the crime be an assault and battery committed on her person. Turner v. State,
60 Miss., 351.
The failure of the husband to call his wife as a witness for him in a criminal case is not a proper subject
of comment by counsel. Johnson v. State, 63 Miss., 313.
The wife is not a competent witness for a third person in a suit in chancery against ihe husband, who is
joined as defendant, even though he be not a necessary party. Leach v. Shelby, 58 Miss., 681.
The widow is a competent witness on behalf of the estate of her deceased husband to prove a conversation
between her husband in his life-time and the opposing party. Stuhlmuller v. Ewing, 39 Miss., 447.
1740 (1602). Incompetency of claimant against estate of decedent.—A per
son shall not testify as a witness to establish his own claim or defense against the
estate of a deceased person which originated during the life-time of such deceased
person, or any claim he has transferred since the death of such decedent. But such
person so interested shall be permitted to give evidence in support of his claim or
defense against the estate of a deceased person which originated after the death of
such deceased person in the course of administering the estate.
In an action against the survivor of a partnership to recover money borrowed in the name of the firm
by the deceased partner, the lender is a competent witness to establish the debt. Faler v. Jordan, 44
Miss., 283.
A surviving party to a contract is not competent as a witness to prove payment in a suit on. the contract
by the representative of the other party. Buckingham v. Walker, 48 Miss., 609.
The term " claim" is not limited to a fixed debt, nor to a demand ex contractu. Lamar v. Williams, 39
Miss., 342; Rothschild v. Hatch, 54 Miss., 554.
In a suit by the representative of the estate, a defendant is incompetent to testify to a contract between
himself and the decedent. Otey v. McAfee, 38 Miss., 348; Boylan v. Holt, 45 Miss., 277.
A party plaintiff who has no beneficial interest in the suit, is a competent witness for the usee. Hedges
v. Aydelott, 46 Miss., 99.
The statute applies where the witness has assigned his claim since the death of deceased "without
recourse," and is being prosecuted by his assignee. (Note the change in statute since Rothschild v. Hatch,
54 Miss., 554, overruling Reinhardt v. Evans, which latter case is re-established to the extent stated.) Reinhardt v. Evans, 48 Miss., 230; Jones v. Sherman, 56 Miss., 559; Gordon v. McEachin, 57 Miss., 834.
If the assignment be made before the death of the decedent, the assignor is a competent witness. Snell
t. Fewell, 64 Miss., 655.
An executor or administrator is not competent to establish any item of credit in his accounts originating
in the life-time of decedent. Haralson v. White, 38 Miss., 178; Gordon v. McEachin, 57 Miss., 834.
But is competent to testify as to matters occurring after the death of his intestate. McDonald v. Mc
Donald, 68 Miss., 689.
When the cause of action originated after the death of decedent, the parties to the suit are competent
witnesses. Witherspoon v. Blewett, 47 Miss., 570.
Where one is not a party to the suit, and the personal representative of the deceased is not asserting a
claim against him, nor is there involved a claim for himself which he is attempting to establish, he is a com
petent witness. Wood v. Stafford, 50 Miss., 370.
The original debtor is a competent witness to show that defendant's intestate assumed his debt to the
plaintiff, and is liable therefor. Sweatman v. Parker, 49 Miss., 19.
The term "estate" is used, in its broad and popular sense, to signify all the property of every kind which
one leaves at his death ; and any right asserted against the estate of a deceased person which accrued to a
party by virtue of dealings between him and the deceased, cannot be established by the evidence of the living
party. Jacks v. Bridewell, 51 Miss., 881 ; Green v. Mizelle, 54 Miss., 220; Rothschild v. Hatch, 54 Miss.,
554; Jackson v. Smith, 68 Miss., 53.

I74I-I744

EVIDENCE.

The statute applies in a proceeding to enforce a mechanic's lien. O'Leary v. Burns, 53 Miss., 171.
A widow is not a competent witness to prove her claim, arising from dealings with her deceased husband,
against his estate, but is competent to prove her transactions as executrix of his estate, although the creditors
of her husband, with whose representative she is litigating, be dead. Buckingham v. Wesson, 54 Miss., 526.
Where a party testified on a former trial of the cause and died, and his evidence on that trial was intro
duced on a subsequent trial thereof, after his death, the other party is competent to testify as to the matters
embraced in the testimony of the dead party. Strickland v. Hudson, 55 Miss., 235.
To exclude a party as a witness to prove his own claim or right, it must be against the estate of a deceased
person in the suit in which he proposes to testify. Love v. Stone, 56 Miss., 449; Cole v. Gardner, 67 Miss.,
670; Jackson v. Smith, 68 Miss., 53.
It is not a valid objection that the testimony of the witness will remotely and collaterally contribute to or
create a liability that may or may not be vindicated in some other proceeding. Griffin v. Lower, 37 Miss., 45* ;
Lamar v. Williams, 39 Miss., 342; Faler v. Jordan, 44 Miss., 283; Love v. Stone, 56 Miss., 449; McCutchen
v. Bice, 56 Miss., 455; Fennell v. McGowan, 58 Miss., 261 ; Combs v. Black, 62 Miss., 831 ; Cole v. Gardner,
67 Miss., 670.
In a suit against a surviving partner on a partnership contract made by the survivor with the plaintiff,
the latter may testify as to a conversation of the surviving partner, although it occurred in the life-time of
the deceased partner. McCutchen v. Rice, 56 Miss., 455.
And this is true though the transaction were with the deceased partner. Combs v. Black, 62 Miss., 831.
On the trial of exceptions to a final account, creditors of the testator are competent witnesses as to the
propriety of the executor's action in paying their demands. Gordon v. McEachen, 57 Miss., 834.
Where the question is one of the admissibility of other evidence—a question to be determined by the
court—the statute does not apply. Bookout v. Shannon, 59 Miss., 378; Harper v. Lacey, 62 Miss., 5.
The statute does not preclude a party from testifying to the loss of a written instrument upon which he
bases his claim, for the purpose of laying the foundation for the introduction of other evidence to prove its
contents. Harper v. Lacey, 62 Miss., 5; Cole v. Gardner, 67 Miss., 670.
In a suit by an administrator for the recovery of personal property, the defendant is incompetent to tes
tify, though the point in issue be whether the property belonged to the estate of the deceased or defendant.
Rushing v. Rushing, 52 Miss., 329.
A husband who j»ins his wife in conveying her real estate, and afterward joins her in a suit to cancel the
deed for fraud against the legatees of the grantee, is a competent witness. Ellis v. Alford, 64 Miss., 8.
Under the statute, the deposition of a plaintiff, taken during the life-time of the defendant and pending
suit, cannot be read on the trial after defendant's death and revivor of the suit. Hewlett v. R agsdale, 68
Miss., 703.
1741 (1603). Accused competent witness (Laws 1882, p. 109).—The accused
shall be a competent witness for himself in any prosecution for crime against him;
but the failure of the accused; in any case, to testify shall not operate to his preju
dice or be commented on by counsel.
Where an accused person testifies, in the exercise of his right under the statute, his testimony may after
wards be used against him. Hill v. State, 64 Miss., 431.
The testimony of the accused should have such effect as the jury think it deserves, unfettered by instruc
tions to weigh it carefully and with great caution. Thomas v. State, 61 Miss., 60; Buckley v. State, 62 Miss.,
705; Woods v. State, 67 Miss., 575.
The court cannot require the accused to be examined before his other witnesses are put upon the stand.
Bell v. State, 66 Miss., 192.
1742 (1604). Religious belief, or want of it, no disqualification.—A person
shall not be incompetent as a witness because of religious belief or the want of it.
1743 (1600). Conviction, except for perjury, no disqualification.— A convic
tion of a person for any offense, except perjury and subornation of perjury, shall not
disqualify such person as a witness, but such conviction may be given in evidence to
impeach his credibility. A person convicted of perjury or subornation of perjury
shall not afterwards be a competent witness in any case, although pardoned or pun
ished for the same.
Under the statute, a convicted principal may testify against his accessory. Keithler v. State, 10 Smed& M.f 192.
1744 (1605). Examination of witnesses; affirmation.—Any witness, being
scrupulous of taking an oath, may give testimony upon his solemn affirmation,
which shall be as good and effectual as an oath. The form of affirmation shall be, in
456

EVIDENCE.

1745-1749

substance, as follows, to wit: "You do solemnly and truly declare and affirm," etc.
In all cases where an oath or affidavit is required by law, it shall be sufficient if the
same be made or given on the solemn affirmation of the party.
1745 (1606). Witness committed for refusal to testify.—If any person subpoe
naed as a witness in any case or matter, shall refuse to be sworn or affirmed, or to
give evidence, he shall be committed to prison by the court, justice, master, com

without bail until he shall be sworn or affirmed and give his evidence.
1746 (1607). Witness examined touching interest or conviction.—Any wit
ness may be examined touching his interest in the cause or his conviction of any
crime, and his answers may be contradicted, and his interest or his conviction of a
crime established by other evidence ; and a witness shall not be excused from answer
ing any question, material and relevant, unless the answer would expose him to
criminal prosecution or penalty. (See §§ 1430-1434.)
The record of a conviction of a misdemeanor is admissible. Helm v. State, 67 Miss., 562.
1747 (1608). Depositions; when taken for use in circuit court.—Depositions

the party desiring to take a deposition of a witness within the state, to be used in
the circuit court, that the witness is material, and stating the reason for taking the

The supreme court will not consider objections to a deposition in chancery unless the record show that
they were passed upon in the court below. Jones v. Loggins, 37 Miss., 546.
The fact that a deposition was read without objection on one trial will not preclude objections to it before

Where a deposition is taken in the presence of both parties, objections not then made to the deposition
upon the ground that the answers are not responsive to the questions, will not be noticed. Smith v. Williams,
38 Miss., 48.

of the cause. Four months shall be allowed for taking depositions after answer filed
before the cause shall be set down for hearing by the defendant.
The /our months begin to run from the date of filing the answer, even though the affidavit thereto at the
time be defective, and a formal affidavit be filed afterwards. Hart v. Bloomfield, 6G Miss., 100.
A failure by complainant to object that the cause is prematurely set down for hearing by the defendant,
is a waiver of the time allowed for taking depositions. Hart v. Bloomfield, 60 Miss., 100.
1761 (1943). How testimony of non-resident party obtained. —If the testi
mony of a party to the suit who resides out of the state be desired by the adverse
party, interrogatories to him may be filed in the clerk's office, and a copy thereof,
with notice of filing, shall be given the party, or his attorney or solicitor; and if
he fail to answer such interrogatories within a reasonable time, his suit shall be dis
missed, if he be plaintiff or complainant ; and if he be defendant, his plea or answer
may be taken oft' the file and judgment by default entered, or the bill be taken as
confessed.

the attainment of justice, the deposition shall not be admitted in evidence for the
party taking it if such persou be alive at the time of trial and not unable to attend

days of the time of hearing the case, the affidavit required may be made at any
400

EVIDENCE.

1764-1768

time before the trial. Any party or witness thus required to attend shall be enti
tled to compensation as any other witness.
Where an affidavit has been made by a party to the cause under the statute, and his adversary declines
to examine the witness before the court, the affiant party may also refuse to examine him, and may, by motion,

cils, and of the record thereof when recorded according to the laws of this state,
shall be admitted as evidence when certified by the clerk in whose office the same
is kept, under his seal of office.
1782 (1623). Land-office certificates.—All certificates issued in pursuance of any
act of congress by any board of commissioners, register of any land-office, or any other
person authorized to issue such certificate, founded on any warrant, order of survey,
entry, grant, confirmation, donation, pre-emption, or purchase from the United
States of any land in this state, shall vest the full legal title to such land in the per
son to whom such certificate is granted, his heirs or assigns, so far as to enable the
holder thereof to maintain an action thereon, and the same shall be received in evi
dence as such, saving the paramount rights of other persons.
The certificate is but a substitute for a better title, and is not on an equal footing with a patent- If a
patent be issued to another person to the same land after a certificate of entry to one without a patent, the
holder of the patent will prevail in an action of ejectment against the holder of the certificate. Dickinson v.
Brown, 9 Smed. & M., 130.
But a prior entry and a certificate thereof, without a patent, gives a better right in equity than a subse
quent entry of the same land by another to whom a patent is issued ; and a court of chancery, at the instance
of the first enterer, will set aside the title of the patentee. Hester v. Kimbrough, 12 Smed. & M., 659.
The statute gives to the certificate the effect of vesting a complete legal title, to all intents and purposes,
in the person to whom issued and his assignees, and not simply to entitle the holder to recover the land in an
action. Lindsey v. Henderson, 27 Miss., 502.
The certificate vests title only when properly issued and while in full force and uncanceled. Where the
certificate was indorsed, " suspended for want of township plat," and was deposited in the general land-office
at Washington City, but was sent to the plaintiff to be used for the purpose of testing his title to the land,
and then to be relumed, it was insufficient to vest title and sustain ejectment. Davis v. Freeland, 32 Miss., 645.
1783 (1624). Certified copies of records of any United States office.—Copies
of the records, books, and files belonging to the offices of the United States, certi
fied by the officer having charge thereof, shall be competent evidence in all cases
where the originals or sworn copies could be admitted.
A certificate of the register of the land-office that a map is a correct representation, is not sufficient; it
must be certified to be a true copy of the original, and that, the original is of record in his office Martin v.
King, 3 How. (Miss.), 125.
It seems that copies of notices and confirmation of claims, and journals of the commissioners appointed
under act of congress providing for the disposal of land south of the state of Tennessee, of record in the landoffice, are competent evidence in questions of boundary, if not of title, Vick v. Peck, 4 How. (Miss.), 407.
The duly authenticated copy of a certificate of confirmation by the board of commissioners of a Spanish
grant of land west of Pearl river, taken from the records in the land-office, is competent evidence without
accounting for the original. Sessions v. Reynolds, 7 Smed. & M., 130.
In an action of ejectment by an Indian claiming land*under the sixth article of the Chickasaw treaty,
the certificate of the register of the land-office of the district, showing the date of the location of the Indian
on the land, is competent evidence. Wray v. Doe, 10 Smed. & M., 452.

A list of the swamp and overflowed lands located in this state under the act of congress of the 28th of
September, 1850, approved and confirmed by the secretary of the interior, and transmitted by him to the reg
ister of the United States land-office, is a record, and a duly certified copy thereof by the register is compe

veys, and of the township and sectional maps of lands, deposited in the office of the

dence.
1786. Surveyor's certificate prima facie. —The certificate of a county surveyor
or his deputy of any survey made by him of any lands in his county, or of any
lands surveyed by him under order of court, shall be presumptive evidence of the
facts connected with and pertinent to the survey therein contained, unless such sur
veyor or his deputy shall be interested therein.
1787 (2091, 2198). Certified copy of appointment of foreign administrator,
etc.—A duly certified copy of the record of appointment and qualification of an
executor, administrator, or guardian in other states, in the territories, the District
of Columbia, or in foreign countries, according to the laws thereof, and the certifi

able, that he is there liable to account for the thing sued for or received, when filed

dence, and certified copies thereof by the clerk of the chancery court in whose office
the same is filed, shall likewise be evidence.

EVIDENCE.

1792 (1749). Copy from judgment-roll evidence.—A copy of the entry on the

tor, executor, or guardian, copies of the same, certified by the clerk or other officer

duction of the original shall be necessary, in which case, the clerk or other officer,
being subpoenaed, shall attend with the bond on the trial of the issue.
1794 (1631.) Copies of writings filed in other courts.—If an action be brought
on a bond or other writing, filed in a suit brought thereon in any other court, it
shall be sufficient for the plaintiff' to file with his declaration a copy of the bond or
■writing, attested by the clerk of the court in which the original may be filed; and
such copy shall be admitted as evidence on the trial. If the defendant, by plea,
deny the execution of the original bond or writing, the clerk of the court having
such paper in his custody, shall, on being subpoenaed, attend with the same on the
trial of the issue.
1795 (1628). Certificate of officer of search in office, etc , admissible as evi
dence. —A certificate, under his hand and official seal, by the officer to whom the
legal custody of a record or paper belongs, that he has made diligent search in his
office for the record or paper, and that it cannot be found therein, shall be admissible
in evidence, and have the same effect as if the officer personally testified to the fact
stated in such certificate.
If it be shown that notes proper to be introduced at the hearing as part of the evidence should have
been filed with the papers in a pre-existing suit, the certificate of the clerk in whose office such papers should
be that the notes cannot be found in his office after diligent search for them, is sufficient to authorize the
admission of secondary evidence of their existence, contents, and genuineness. Tigner v. McGehee, 60
Miss., 185.
1796 (1620). Presumption attending certain certificates.—Any certificate,
attestation, or authentication purporting to have been made or given by any person
as an officer of any state or of the United States, shall be prima facie evidence of
the official character of such person. (See § 539.)
1797 (1633). When proof of signature, etc., unnecessary.—In suits founded
on any written instrument set forth in the pleading, it shall not be necessary to
prove the signature or execution thereof, unless the same be specially denied by a
plea, verified by the oath of the party pleading the same ; and it shall not be neces
sary in any case to prove any written signature, the execution of any instrument,
or the identity or names of persons, or description of character, or the persons
composing any firm or partnership which may be set forth in the pleadings, unless
the same be specially denied by plea, verified by oath. And the like rule shall pre
vail, as far as may be applicable, in all cases where any writing is pleaded or set up
by the defendant, or any signature, identity, or names of persons, description of
character, or partnership set forth in his pleading.
A corporation suing need not prove that it is a corporation, unless that fact be denied by plea under
oath. Reed v. Benton R. R. Co., 4 How. (Miss.), 257; Vicksburg, etc., Co. v. Washington, I Smed. & M.,536.
The general issue, accompanied by defendant's affidavit which denies the execution of the instrument
sued on, is equivalent to the plea of non est factum. Sumpter v. Gerou. 4 How. (Miss ), 263.
466

EVIDENCE.

1798-1801

Alterations after its execution of the instrument sued on may be proved without pleading under oath.
Henderson v. Wilson, 6 How. (Miss.), 65.
The general issue, accompanied by defendant's affidavit denying the character in which plaintiff sues,
meets the requirement of the statute. Vicksburg, etc., Co. v. Washington, 1 Smed. & M., 536.
The general issue sworn to is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute. Thornton v. Alliston,
12 Smed. & M., 124.
Where one is garnished as debtor to a company which is sued as being a corporation, and the garnishee
answers denying indebtedness, he cannot, on the trial of the truth of his answer, be heard to object that the
company is not a corporation, not having denied that fact under oath. Saflfold v. Barnes, 39 Miss. 399.
It is only when the plaintiff sues in an artificial character or representative capacitj- that a plea under
oath is required to put him to the proof of such character {explaining Moore v. Anderson, 3 Smed. & M., 321,
and Beard v. Griffin, 10 Smed. & M., 586). Anderson v. Leland, 46 Miss., 290; Hope v. Hurt, 59 Miss., 174.
The section applies to suits before justices of the peace. McBride v. Kilgore, 55 Miss., 242.
1798 (1634). When partnership need not be proved.—In suits against one or
more of several co-partners, founded on any written contract made in the co-part
nership name, it shall not be necessary to prove the co-partnership signature, or
that the defendant was a member of said partnership, unless the same be specially
denied by plea, verified by the oath of the party pleading the same; and it shall
not be necessary in any case to prove the persons composing a partnership which
may be set forth in the pleadings, unless the same be specially denied by a plea,
verified by the oath of the party pleading the same ; and this rule shall apply to all
pleas and legal proceedings to which the same may apply.
The partnership can be denied only by special plea verified 1)3' oath. Hirsch v. Shafer, 66 Miss., 439.
1799 (1635). When subscription of stock need not be proved.—In suits by
any corporation to recover an installment or call upon the capital stock subscribed
by any person, it shall not be necessary for the corporation to prove that the sub
scription was made, or that the installment or call was required to be paid, or that
publication thereof was made, if the same be distinctly averred in the pleading,
unless the defendant shall specially deny the same by plea verified by oath.
1800. When proof of notice of dishonor of bills, etc., unnecessary.—When
the drawer or indorser of any bill of exchange, or the indorser of a promissory note,
is sued thereon, it shall not be necessary to prove notice of the dishonor of the
bill or note to such drawer or indorser, or a waiver of notice, unless the same be
specially denied by plea, verified by the oath of the party pleading the same.
1801 (1627). Affidavit to account entitles to judgment—A person desiring
to institute suit upon an open account in his favor, may make affidavit to the cor
rectness of such account, and that it is due from the party against whom it is
charged ; and in any suit thereon such affidavit attached to the account shall entitle
the plaintiff to judgment at the trial term of the suit, unless the defendant make
affidavit and file with his plea that the account is not correct, particularizing
wherein it is not correct, in which event the affidavit to the account shall entitle the
plaintiff to judgment only for such part of the account as the defendant by his
affidavit shall not deny to be due; but this shall not apply to accounts against
* decedents and suits against executors or administrators. A defendant desiring
to use an open account as a set-off shall be entitled to the benefit of this section.
The statute does not alter the law of pleadings, and the defendant, without a counter-affidavit, is entitled
to have the case submitted to the jury under the plea of the general issue, notwithstanding the account be
sworn to. Reinhardt v. Carter, 49 Miss., 315; Aaron v. Podesta, 60 Miss., 82.
Where the account is sworn to, and there is no counter-affidavit, it is too late, after the introduction of
evidence without objection, and when the hearing of it is closed, for the plaintiff to demand an instruction
467

1802-1805

EVIDENCE.

to the jury to disregard the defendant's evidence denying the correctness of the account. Bloom v. McQrath,
53 Miss., 249; Covel v. Smith, 68 Miss., 296.
The sole object of the statute is to dispense with proof of the original correctness of the account when
sworn to, unless defendant shall deny it by affidavit filed with his plea. Reinhardt v. Carter, 49 Miss., 315;
Bower v. Henshaw, 53 Miss., 345.
Where the account sued on is properly sworn to, an affidavit by the defendant, filed with his plea, that
the account is not correct, does not put the plaintiff to the proof of the items thereof, but does put him to the
proof of the defendant's liability therefor. Tichenor v. Woodburn, 54 Miss., 589.
On appeal from a justice of the peace the counter-affidavit may be filed in the circuit court for the first
time, if leave be asked before plaintiff has introduced his account and affidavit in evidence and closed the
case. After that it is too late. Rose v. Watson, 54 Miss., 673.
Where the account sued on was properlv sworn to, and, without a counter-affidavit, defendant demurred to
the evidence, the supreme court, on reversing the judgment thereon in favor of defendant, for error, will
render one for the plaintiff. Ware v. McQuillan, 54 Miss., 703.
The statute is not applicable except in cases where the cause of action arose ex contractu. Illinois B.
R. Co. v. Andrews, 61 Miss , 474.
1802 (1636). Dishonor of bills and notes; how proved. —The record of the
officer protesting any promissory note or bill of exchange, or a copy thereof, shall,
when verified by the oatli of the officer, be evidence of the facts therein stated
touching the dishonor of such bill or note, and the giving or mailing of the notice
thereof to the parties thereto secondarily liable; and the statement therein that
notice was given or mailed to any of such parties, and any place mentioned therein
as the post-office address of any of such parties, shall be prima facie evidence that
notice was given or mailed, and that the place mentioned was the party's proper
post-office address.
The notarial record sworn to is not conclusive evidence. Wood v. American, 7 How. (Miss.). 609.
The statute relates exclusively to protests in this state. White v. Englehard, 2 Smed. & M., 38.
The record of protest, unless verified by the oath of the officer, is not competent evidence. Stiles v.
Inman, 55 Miss., 409.
1803 (1637). Publication of notices; how proved.—The publication of any
notice in a newspaper, when required by law or by order of court, may be proved
by the production of a copy of the notice, with the affidavit of the printer, pub
lisher, clerk, or superintendent of the newspaper, specifying the respective num
bers and dates of the newspaper In which publication was made; and such affidavit
shall be evidence. Any officer authorized to take an affidavit who may reside in
the vicinity of or convenient to the printer, publisher, clerk, or superintendent of
the newspaper in which publication may have been made, shall, on application of a
party interested, by subpu-na or otherwise, require the printer, publisher, clerk, or
superintendent to appear before him at a time and place to be appointed ; and such
officer shall then and there take the deposition of the printer, publisher, clerk, or
superintendent to the matters required to be certified; and the affidavit or deposi
tion and certificate shall be sealed up, indorsed, and transmitted to the court where
the same is required to be used, in the same manner as required for the return of
depositions.
1804 (1639). How posting proved and effect as evidence.—The posting of
any notice required by law or the order of any court may be proved by filing a copy
of the notice, with an affidavit of posting, in the court in which the proceeding was
had in which the notice was required; and such affidavit shall be competent evi
dence in all courts, and shall be prima facie evidence of what it states.
1805 (1649). Certain papers prima facie evidence.—In all cases where land
was sold for taxes under a law which made the collector's deed or conveyance or
468

EVIDENCE.

l8o6-l8lO

list of land sold prima facie evidence of the validity of the assessment and sale of
the lands, the deed or conveyance or list shall still be such evidence, notwithstand
ing the repeal of the law.
The statute applied in Hardie v. Chriaman, 60 Miss., 671.
1806 (526). Tax-collector's deed, etc., prima facie evidence.—A conveyance
made by a tax-collector to an individual purchaser of laud at a sale for taxes, and
the list of lands sold to the state at such sale, shall be prima facie evidence that the
assessment and sale of the land were legal and valid.
The presumption in favor of the validity of the tax-sale extends to and includes, in the absence of proof
to the contrary, the filing of the deed by the collector as required by law. Wheeler v. Ligon, 62 Miss., 560.
See annotations to £3817.
1807. Transcribed records. —"Whenever the records of a county, or of any
court or office, or any part thereof, shall be transcribed by order of the board of
supervisors, in pursuance of law, the copy or transcribed record shall be evidence,
and shall prima facie have the same force and effect as the originals from which the
transcript is made. (See § 299.)
1808 (1059). Injury to persons or property by railroads prima facie evidence
of want of skill, etc. —In all actions against railroad companies for damage done
to persons or property, proof of injury inflicted by the running of the locomotives
or cars of such company shall be prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable
skill and care on the part of the servants of the company in reference to such injury.
In a suit against a railroad for killing a horse, marks of the animal on the track and the position of its
remains mav, without an eye-witness, make out a prima facie case under the statute. Chicago B. R. Co. v.
Packwood, 59 Miss., 280.
The statute does not apply to causes of action arising ex contractu. Chicago R. R. Co. v. Trotter, 60
Miss., 442.
If the proof of the damage, the plaintiff's own evidence, show that the defendant was not guilty of neg
ligence, the statute does not aid the case. Mobile R. R. Co. v. Holt, 62 Miss., 170.
If it be shown that a fire was produced by an engineer of defendant railroad throwing a burning piece of
wood from the engine on the company's right of way, whence the fire spread and destroyed plaintiff's property
sued for, a prima facie case, under the statute, is made out. Damage by fire is within the section. Mobile
R. R. Co. v. Gray, 62 Miss., 383; Louisville R. R. Co. v. Natchez R. R. Co., 67 Miss., 399.
The railroad must show the facts, if they do not appear from the plaintiff's evidence, to exonerate itself
from liability when it be shown that injury was inflicted by the running of its locomotive or cars. It cannot
rely on presumptions or conjectures. Vicksburg R. R. Co. v. Hamilton, 62 Miss., 503; Kansas City R. R.
Co. v. Doggett, 67 Miss., 250.
A precedent wrong on the part of the injured person, producing the conditions which resulted in the
injury, does not prevent the application of the statute. Vicksburg R. R. Co. v. Phillips, 64 Miss., 693.
Presumptions should yield to facts where they are sufficiently shown; but it is not error in such a case to
instruct a jury that the law presumes wrontr, prima facie, from the fact of injury by the running of cars, etc.
Vicksburg R. R. Co. v. Phillips, 64 Miss., 693; New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Bourgeois, 66 Miss., 3.
If the plaintiff make out merely a prima facie case under the statute, and the defendant, by undisputed
evidence, show that its servants did every thing possible to prevent the injury, the court may properly direct
a verdict for defendant. Bedford v. Louisville B. B. Co., 65 Miss., 385.
1809 (2297). Private acts of legislature evidence, without being specially
pleaded.—Private acts of the legislature may be given in evidence without being
specially pleaded, and the printed acts of the legislature, published by authority
thereof, shall be competent evidence of such acts.
1810. Foregoing provisions applicable to all courts.—All things contained
in this chapter, not restricted by their nature or by express provision to partic
ular courts, shall apply to and govern all courts.

CHAPTER 67.
JOINT AND SEVERAL DEBTORS.
2352 (1003). Effect of releasing one or more joint debtors.— In all cases of
joint or joint and several indebtedness, the creditor may settle or compromise with
and release any one or more of such debtors; and the settlement or release shall
not affect the right or remedy of the creditor against the other debtors for the
amount remaining due and unpaid, and shall not operate to release any of the
others of the said debtors; and all mortgages or securities for the said indebtedness
shall remain in full force against the debtors not released, in favor of the creditor,
and also in favor of such of the debtors as may be entitled to contribution, pay
ment, or re-imbursement from others of said debtors, and the right of payment,
contribution, or re-imbursement, as among themselves, shall not be affected by this
section ; and if any debtor, so released, shall have paid more than his ratable
share of the whole debt, the whole amount paid by him shall be credited, and if
less than his ratable share, then the full amount of his ratable share shall be cred
ited, and the other debtors shall be liable for the residue.
2353 (1134). Judgment against one does not affect rights against the other.
—In any action founded on a joint or joint and several bond, covenant, bill of
■exchange, promissory note, or other contract, or on a contract or liability of copart
ners, it shall be lawful to sue any one or more of the parties liable on such bond,
covenant, bill of exchange, promissory note, or other contract or liability; and
separate suits may be brought against the representatives of such of the parties as
have died, or joint suits may be brought against the representatives of the deceased
party and those who are alive and bound therein ; and the rendition of judgment
against one or more joint or joint and several debtors shall not affect any right of
the plaintiff as to the other parties, unless satisfaction have been obtained.
This section abolishes all distinctions in remedies upon joint and joint and several obligations, and makes
them all joint and several. Steen v. Finley, 26 Miss , 535.
A judgment against one partner unsatisfied is not a bar to an action against another partner. Hyman
v. Stadler, 63 Miss., 362; Scharffv. Noble, 67 Miss., 143.

CHAPTER 68.
JURIES.
2354 (1661). Who are competent jurors. —Every male citizen, not under the
age of twenty-one years, who 'is duly registered as a voter and able to read and
write, has not been convicted of an infamous crime, and who is not a common
gambler nor an habitual drunkard, and is not nor has been within twelve months
the overseer of a public road, is a competent juror ; but the lack of any such quali
fication on the part of one or more jurors shall not vitiate an indictment or verdict.
It shall be a good cause to challenge any tales juror, that he has served as such in
584

JURIES.

2355-2358

the trial of as many as three cases at that or the last preceding term of the court;
and of an}' juror, that he has a case of his own pending in that court and for trial
at that term.
An employe of one of the parties is incompetent as a juror. Hubbard v. Rutledge, 57 Miss., 7; Louis
ville R. R. Co. v. Mask, 64 Miss., 738.
That portion of the statute relating to the service by a juror in the trial of as many as three cases, does
not apply to members of the regular panel. Louisville R. R. Co. v. Mask, 64 Miss., 738.
2355 (3072). Opinion not to render incompetent in a criminal case, when.—
Any person, otherwise competent, who will make oath that he is impartial in the
case, shall he competent as a juror in any criminal case, notwithstanding the fact
that he has an impression or an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused,
if it appear to the satisfaction of the court that he has no bias of feeling or preju
dice in the case, and no desire to reach any result in it, except that to which the
evidence may conduct; but any juror shall be excluded, if the court be of opinion
that he cannot try the case impartially, and the exclusion shall not be assignable
for error.
It is the duty of the court to see that a fair, competent, and impartial jury is selected to try every case.
Ferriday v. Selser, 4 How. (Miss.), 506; Gilliam v. Brown, 43 Miss., 641.
The court mav set aside a juror who has not been challenged by either party. Lewis v. The State, 9
Smed. & M., 115; Williams v. The State, 32 Miss., 389.
The court must examine into the sufficiency of every objection to a juror. The consent of the other party
to the objection does not deprive the court of the power. McCarty v. The State, 26 Miss., 299.
The court may discharge from the panel a juror who has been accepted and sworn, before testimony is
introduced, if it.be discovered that he is incompetent. Williams v. The State, 32 Miss., 389.
A juror who has conscientious scruples about the infliction of capital punishment is incompetent when
a verdict might be followed bv the infliction of the death penalty. Lewis v. State, 9 Smed. & M., 115; Williams
Y. The State, 32 Miss., 389; Jones v. The State, 57 Miss., 684; Spain v. The State, 59 Miss., 19.
The fact that a juror had conversed with a witness does not disqualify him, if he have not a "fixed
opinion " as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Penn v. The State, 62 Miss., 450.
2356 (1662). Who exempt; length of service of tales and grand jurors.—
All officers in the executive department of the state government, all judges aud
officers of the several state courts, all county and county district officers, all physi
cians actually in practice, all teachers and officers of public schools actually engaged
in their vocation, all keepers of public mills and ferries who personally pursue those
callings as their principal business, all ministers of the gospel and Jewish rabbis
actually engaged in their calling, all officers of the government of the United States,
all lawyers practicing their profession, all telegraph operators, one apothecary to
every store where drugs and medicines are the principal articles for sale, shall be
exempt from serving as jurors. All other persons shall be liable to serve as jurors,
unless excused by the court for the time being on cause shown; but a tales juror,
save when drawn and retained for the week, shall not be compelled to serve two
days successively, unless the case in which he is impaneled continue longer than

made final at the same term unless good cause be shown in writing.
2371. Grand jurors; how drawn.—The number of grand jurors shall not be
less than fifteen nor more than twenty, in the discretion of the court; and they
shall be drawn from the list of persons in attendance as jurors, in the following

put in a box or hat, in open court, and there shall then be drawn out, by a person
designated by the judge, the number directed by the court, and the jurors whose
names are so drawn shall constitute the grand jury, and be impaneled and sworn as
such. (See § 2383.)
2372 (1666). Foreman appointed and all sworn.—The court shall appoint one
of the grand jurors to be foreman of the grand jury, to whom the following oath

duties of public officers, aucl especially those relating to the collection and paying

ness, and other misdemeanors in office ; those providing for the working of the pub
lic roads and the building of bridges ; and in a county where there is a male high

ing any grand juror as such, he shall be examined by the court, on oath, touching his
qualification ; and, alter the grand jurors shall have been sworn and impaneled, no
objection shall be raised, by plea or otherwise, to the grand jury; but the impan
eling of the grand jury shall be conclusive evidence of its competency and qualifica
tions; but any party interested may challenge or except to the array for fraud.
This statute completely cuts off the plea in abatement challenging the fitness and qualifications of the
grand jury or of any of its members. Head v. The State, 44 Miss., 731; Durrah v. The State, 44 Miss., 789.
Unless the contrary appear from the record, the presumption is that the grand jury was legally organ
ized. Chase v. The State, 46 Miss., G83.
2376 (1669). Places of absent jurors supplied.—If, after the grand jury has
been sworn, any of the members thereof should absent themselves from any cause,
or become incompetent to sit, or be excused by the'eourt, the court shall have power

JURIES.

2381 (1676). Grand juror not to disclose secrets of jury-room.—A grand
juror, except when called as a witness in court, shall not disclose any proceeding or
action had by that body, in relation to offenses brought before it, within six mouths
after the adjournment of the court at which he was a grand juror; nor shall any
grand juror disclose the name or testimony of any witness who has been before it,
on pain of fine or imprisonment for contempt of court.
A member of. a grand jury which finds an indictment is a competent witness on the trial of it. Rocco v.
The State, 37 Miss., 357.
2382 (1677). Witnesses before grand jury subpoenaed and sworn.—The
foreman of the grand jury shall have power to order subpoenas for all witnesses
desired to be produced, and he shall also have power to swear all witnesses. A
record shall be kept by the foreman and returned to court, certified and signed by
the foreman, of the names of all witnesses sworn before the grand jury.
2383. How petit juries impaneled.—After the drawing of the grand jury, the
remaining jurors in attendance shall be impaneled into two petit juries for the first
week of court if there be a sufficient number left, and, if not, the juries may be
completed from the by-standers, or the court may direct a sufficient number for that
purpose to be drawn and summoned ; but if there be more than enough jurors for
the two juries, or for one jury if the court shall direct only one to be impaneled,
the excess may be discharged, or they may be retained, in the discretion of the
court, to serve as talesmen; and, if so retained, they7 shall have the privilege of
members of the regular panel, of exemption from service. (See § 2371.)
2384 (1697). Oath of petit jurors.—Petit jurors shall be sworn in the following
form :
"You, and each of you, do solemnly ^wear [or affirm] that you will well and
truly try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry that may be submitted to you,
or left to your decision by the 'court, during the present term, and true verdicts
give according to the evidence. So help you God."
The oath shall authorize the jury to try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry
which may be submitted to it during that term of the court ; and talesmen, if any
be summoned or retained, shall in like manner be sworn to tryr all issues and execute
all writs of inquiry which may be submitted to them during the day for which they
are summoned or the time for which they are retained.
It is not necessary to swear the jury for the week in each case; and talesmen will be presumed to have
been duly sworn, unless the record show the contrary. Pierce v. Tate, 27 Miss., 283.
Where the jury appeared to have been sworn "truly to try the issue joined between the parties," it was
held sufficient {confirming Dyson v. The State, 2G Miss., 362). Windham v. Williams, 27 Miss., 313.
If the record recite that the jury were "impaneled and sworn to sit as jurors in the case," it will be pre
sumed that they were legally sworn. Furniss v. Meredith, 43 Miss., 302.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that the jury were sworn. Waddell v.
Magee, 53 Miss , 687.
2385 (1693). When court to order jurors drawn and summoned.—If at any
regular or special term of a circuit court it appear that jurors have not been drawn
or summoned for the term, or for any part thereof, or that the jurors have been
irregularly drawn or summoned, or that none of the jurors so drawn or summoned
are in attendance, or not a sufficient number to make the grand jury and two petit
juries, the court shall immediately cause the proper number of jurors to be drawn
590

JURIBS.

2386-2388

from the box and summoned, or, if there be not a jury-box to be drawn from, the
court shall direct the requisite number of persons, qualified as jurors, to be sum
moned to appear at such time as the court shall appoint, and the court shall there
upon proceed as if the jurors had been regularly drawn and summoned.
The statute contemplates only two juries, but does not prohibit a third jury. Barnes v. The State, 60
Miss., 355.
2386 (3058). Special venire facias in capital cases.—When any person charged
with a capital crime shall have been arraigned and the plea of not guilty entered, it
shall be the duty of the court, upon the demand of the accused or the district attor
ney, to cause to be drawn, in open court, from the jury-box not more than fifty
names; and it shall be the duty of the clerk to issue a special venire facias, com
manding the sheriff*to summon the persons whose names are so drawn to attend the
court on a particular day to be named in the writ ; and in case the special venire be
exhausted without a jury being impaneled from those summoned and in attend
ance, the court shall proceed to make up the jury for the trial of the case from the
regular panel and'tales jurors who may have been summoned for the day; and if,
after exhausting said regular panel and tales jurors, a competent jury be not
obtained, the court shall direct the sherift'to summon forthwith as many tales jurors
as shall be sufficient to complete the jury. And in the event that there should be no
such box, or the same should be mislaid, or the names therein have been exhausted,
then the court may order a special venire facias to be issued by the clerk, directing
the sheriff' to summon as many jurors as may be necessary, not more than fifty, and,
after exhausting the same, to impanel the jury as hereinbefore directed; and the
slips containing the names of all jurors drawn or summoned on a special venire,
and not impaneled on the jury, shall be returned to the box from which they were
drawn immediately after the jury shall be impaneled; and if the special venire be
not demanded, the jury shall be composed of the regular venire for the week and
as many talesmen and by-standers as may be required, to be summoned under the
order of the court.
A direction in a special venire to summon a jury "residing as near as may be to the place where the
murder was committed," is erroneous. Shaffer v. The State, I How. (Miss.), 238.
,
The judge has no authority to discharge one of the special venire without sufficient cause shown. Boles
v. The State, 13 Smed. & SI., 398; Boles v. The State, 24 Miss., 445.
After the jury had been impaneled and sworn, a juror arose and informed the court that he had been of
the grand jury that found the bill. It was not error for the court to set him aside, complete the jury, and have
it resworn Jefferson v. The State, 52 Miss., 767.
It is no ground to quash a special venire that one of the jurors was not a citizen of the United States.
Durrah v. The State, 44 Miss., 780.
If, on defendant's motion, the special venire be quashed, because the box from which it was drawn
was not legally prepared, he cannot be heard to complain of the court ordering a special venire summoned.
Russell v. The State, 53 Miss., 367.
In executing a special venire, where the names are not drawn, the sheriff is not . bound to summon every
man he meets until he get the required number. Cavanah v. The State, 56 Miss., 299.
A special venire may be drawn during the pendency of another case. Penn v. The State, 62 Miss., 450.
2387 (1694). No challenge to array nor venire quashed, except.—A challenge
to the array shall not be sustained, except for fraud, nor shall any venire facias,
except a special venire facias in a criminal case, be quashed for any cause whatever.
2388 (1696). Jurors under the control of the court.—If any juror, summoned
to appear at court, should render himself unfit for service by intoxication before his
name is called in court, he shall be fined in a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars,
591

2389-2392

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

and be imprisoned for a term not exceeding twenty-four hours. After grand and
petit jurors arc impaneled the}- shall be under the control of the court, and, for any
breach of duty or contempt of court, may be lined and imprisoned.
2389 (1672). Jury-laws directory. —All the provisions of law in relation to the
listing, drawing, summoning, and impaneling juries are directory merely; and a
jury listed, drawn, summoned, or impaneled, though in an informal or irregular
manner, shall be deemed a legal jury after it shall have been impaneled and sworn;
and shall ha\ye the power to perform all the duties devolving on the jury.
The supreme court will not interfere with the discretion of the lower court in impaneline the jury unless
it appear that there was a gross and injurious exercise of it. Head v. The State, 41 Miss., 731.
Where -a special venire is ordered without application by the district attorney or defendant, it may be
quashed on motion; but, after the jury is impaneled, the irregularity is cured by the statute, Gavigan v.
The State, 55 Miss., 533.
2390. Juries in condemnation proceedings.—In all cases where a jury is
required in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, the sheriff and clerks of
the circuit and chancery courts shall draw eighteen names from the jury-box, and
the slips containing the names shall be returned to the box. The sheriff shall sum
mon the jury thus drawn, and the jurors shall attend, under the same penalties as
in the circuit court, and the penalties may be enforced therein at the next term, on
complaint of the proper party or of the sheriff. (See § 1082.)
2391. Jury may view the place, etc.— When, in the opinion of the court, on
the trial of any cause, civil or criminal, it is proper for the jury to have a view of
the property which is the subject of litigation, or of the place in which the offense
is charged to have been committed, or in which any material fact occurred, it may
order the jurors to be conducted in a body, under the charge of an officer, to the
place, which shall he shown to them by some person appointed by the court for
that purpose. While the jurors are thus absent, a person other than the one so
appointed shall not speak to them, or either of them, on any subject connected
with the trial. The officer must be sworn not to suffer any person to speak to or
communicate with the jurors, or either of them, nor to do so himself, on any sub
ject connected with the trial, except as authorized by the court, and to return them
into court without unnecessary delay, and at a specified time.

CHAPTER 69.
JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
2392 (2185). Number and districts for election of—There shall he five dis
tricts in each county for the election of justices of the peace, the" boundaries of
which shall be the same as the boundaries of the districts for the election of mem
bers of the board of supervisors, and two justices of the peace shall be elected for
each district by the electors thereof; but the board of supervisors may subdivide
a district into not more than three districts, and cause a justice of the peace to be
elected by and for each subdivision.
592

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

2393-2395

2393 (2186). Oath of office and bond. —Every person elected a justice of the
peace shall, before he enters on the duties of the office, take the oath of office pre
scribed by section one hundred and fifty-five of the constitution, and enter into
bond in the same manner as other county officers, in the penalty of two thousand
dollars, conditioned according to law; and any party interested may proceed on
such bond in a summary way, by motion in any court having jurisdiction of the
same, against the principal and sureties, upon giving five days' previous notice; but
the boards of supervisors of the respective counties shall have power to limit the
penalty of said bonds to a sum not less than five hundred dollars.
2394 (2190). Civil jurisdiction.—Justices of the peace shall have jurisdiction
of all actions for the recovery of debts or damages, or personal property, where the
principal of the debt, the amount of the demand, or the value of the property sought
to be recovered shall not exceed two hundred dollars.
>
An account, though embracing various items, cannot be divided so as to give jurisdiction. Grayson v.
Williams, Walker, 298; Pittman v. Chrisman, 59 Miss., 124.
But plaintiff need not embrace, in the same suit, independent causes of action though all may be due.
(The following cases on the subject are overruled expressly: Scofield v. Pensons, 26 Miss., 402; Mobile R.
R. Co. v. State, 51 Miss., 137; and it seems Morris v. Shryock, 50 Miss., 590). Ash v. Lee, 51 Miss., 101;
Pittman v. Chrisman, 59 Miss., 124: Drysdale v. Biloxi, 67 Miss., 534; McLendon v. Pass, 66 Miss., 110.
In computing the amount in controversy, costs, damages, and interest are excluded. New Orleans R. R.
Co. v. Evans, 49 Miss., 785; Jackson v. Whitfield, 51 Miss , 202.
The justices of the peace have jurisdiction to try a claimant's issue although the value of the property
exceed two hundred dollars. Bernheimer v. Martin, 66 Miss., 486.
The justice's jurisdiction is not limited by the constitution to actions on contracts. Bell v. West Point,
51 Miss., 262; Higgins v. Deloach, 54 Miss., 498.
•
In suits on penal bonds, jurisdiction is determined by the amount of damages honestly claimed. Shattuck v. Miller, 50 Miss., 386; State v. Luckey, 51 Miss., 528.
The demand, where honestly made, fixes and determines the amount in controversy (explaining Askew
v. Askew, 49 Miss., 301). Fenn v. Harrington, 54 Miss., 733; Ross v. Natchez R. R. Co., 61 Miss., 12;
Griffin v. McDaniel, 63 Miss., 121.
The principal of the debt at the time suit is brought, after deducting credits, if any, is the test of juris
diction. Martin v. Harden, 52 Miss., 694.
A justice of the peace cannot consolidate separate and distinct suits, if, when united, the demand exceed
two hundred dollars. Louisville Railroad Co. v. McCollister, 66 Miss., 106.
2395 (2191, 2231). Where suits to be brought.—The jurisdiction of every jus
tice of the peace shall be co-extensive with his county, and he may issue any pro
cess in matters within his jurisdiction, to be executed in any part of his county ;
but every freeholder or householder of the county shall be sued in the district in
which he resides, if there be a justice acting therein and qualified to try the suit, or
in the district in which the debt was contracted, the liability incurred, or in which
the property may be found. And whenever, by reason of interest, relationship to
one of the parties, or other like cause, any justice of the peace shall be disqualified
to preside in any case before him, the same shall be transferred to a justice of the
peace in that or an adjoining district free from such objection, in the county, who
shall hear and determine the same.
If a freeholder or householder be sued out of the proper district, the justice is without power to transfer
the cause. He must dismiss it. Cain v. Simpson, 53 Miss., 521.
A justice of the peace of a district other than the one where the defendant, a freeholder or householder,
resides, and other than the one where the property is found, has no jurisdiction of a replevin suit. Turner v.
Lilly, 56 Miss., 576.
Replevin can be brought in a county where the goods are found, even if the defendant be a freeholder
resident of another county. Ellison v. LewiB, 57 Miss., 588.
A justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of a suit alone against a freeholder or householder of another
county. Cain v. Simpson, 53 Miss., 521.
593

2396-2400

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

A party to a suit before a disqualified justice, who has consented to call another justice to sit in his place,
thereby setting substantially the benefit of a transfer to another justice, cannot thereafter complain of want
of jurisdiction in the justice called in. Cross v. Levy, 57 Miss., 634.
2396 (2192). If two or more defendants, where brought.—In suits or pro
ceedings against two or more defendants, jointly or jointly and severally liable, it
shall be lawful to bring the suit before any justice of the peace of the district
wherein either of the defendants reside; and such justice shall have power to issue
a summons or other process to bring in all co-defendants from any other district or
from any other county.
2397 (2193). Docket.—Every justice of the peace shall keep a well-bound book,
styled " Docket," in which he shall enter the names of the plaintiff and defendant
in any suit brought before him, and the character of the suit; the time of issuing
process and when returnable, and a copy of the return made thereon by the officer;
the time of filing the defendant's set-off, if any; the appearance or default of parties
summoned to appear; the date and amount of the judgment; the execution when
issued, and a copy of the return thereon ; the appeal, when and by whom demanded,
and all the proceedings before him touching the suit ; and he shall make like entries
of all proceedings of a criminal nature before him heard and determined. And it
shall be the duty of a justice, when required, to furnish to either party a certified
copy of such proceedings, and of all papers and process relating thereto.
It is a copy of the entries on this docket which the justice is to transmit, certified, to the circuit court
.on, appeal. Hughston v. Cornish, 59 Miss., 372.
2398 (2239). Entry to identify docket.—Each justice of the peace shall, at the
beginning and in front of all his entries in his docket, make and subscribe substantially the following entry, to wit :
"A docket of proceedings in matters civil and criminal, before
, a justice
of the peace of the county of
, in the state of Mississippi, in district No.
of said county, for the election of justices of the peace.
" "Witness my signature.
, Justice of the Peace."
2399 (2194). Courts. —Justices of the peace shall hold regular terms of their
courts, at such times as they may appoint, not exceeding two and not less than one
in every month, and at such convenient place in their district as they may designate;
and they may continue to hold their courts from day to day so long as business may
require; and all process shall be returnable, and all trials shall take place at such
regular terms, except where it is otherwise provided; but where the defendant is a
non-resident or transient person, and it shall be shown by the oath of either party
that a delay of the trial until the regular term will be of material injury to him, it
shall be lawful for the justice to have the parties brought before him at any reason
able time and hear the evidence and give judgment. Such court shall be a court of
record, with all the power incident to a court of record, including power to fine to
the amount of fifty dollars and imprison one day for contempt of court.
Justices of the peace may. by consent of the parties, postpone the trial of a cause to a particular day
between the regular terms, and then try it and give judgment. Rice v. Locke, 59 Miss., 189.
2400 (2195). Justices may sit together or separately.—The justices of the
peace may sit and act together in holding their courts, but any one may hold his
court by himself, at any point in his district which he may designate. In case of
594

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

disagreement between them, when sitting together, as to the decision of a case, the
justice who issued the process shall decide.
2401 (2196, 2197). How suit begun in civil cases.—Any one desiring to sue
before a justice of the peace shall lodge with him the evidence of debt, statement of
account, or other written statement of the cause of action; and thereupon the jus
tice of the peace shall issue a summons for the defendant, returnable to the next
term of his court, which shall be executed five days before the return-day; but if
the process be executed less than five days before the return-day, the service shall
be good to require the appearance of the defendant at the term next succeeding the
one to which it is returnable. Any summons issued within five days before a term
of the court, shall be made returnable to the next succeeding term, unless a shorter
day be named, in pursuance of the provision for a trial without delay in the case of
non-resident or transient defendants.
It is sufficient to file a copy of a promissory note with the justice. Duncan v. Scott Co., 64 Miss., 38.
2402 (2198). By whom process served; not to be issued to sheriff, if, etc.,
unless, etc.—The sheriff of any county, and his deputies, shall execute any process
directed to him by any justice of the peace; but process shall not be directed to the
sheriff if there be a constable in the district duly qualified to act, unless there be, in
the opinion of the justice of the peace, good reason therefor.
2403 (2199). Person appointed to execute process.—In cases of emergency,
and where a constable or sheriff or deputy sheriff cannot be had in time, the justice
of the peace may appoint some reputable person to execute any process, the justice
to be liable on his bond for all damage which may result to a party to the cause or
other person from his appointment of an insolvent or incompetent person
2404 (2200). Property and process delivered to officer.—Property seized in
execution of any process by one appointed by a justice of the peace to execute it,
shall be immediately delivered, with the process, to the sheriff of the county, or
the constable of the district in which the seizure was made; and the person from
whom the property was taken shall be at once informed who has it; and such prop
erty shall be considered and dealt with as if it had been seized by the officer to
whom it was delivered at the time of its delivery to him.
2405 (2201). Process returned by sheriff or constable.—The process so deliv
ered to the sheriff or constable shall be returned by him to the justice who issued
it, according to its command.
2406 (2202). Witnesses to be subpoenaed. —The justice of peace before whom
any cause is pending shall issue all subpoenas for witnesses which either of the par
ties may require, and such subpoenas shall be returnable on a day certain, giving
reasonable time for attendance; and if any witness, duly subpoenaed, shall fail to
appear, in pursuance of the subpoena, he shall forfeit the sum of ten dollars, for the
use of the party in whose behalf he was subpoenaed, for which the justice may enter
judgment nisi, which shall be made final in case the witness, on being duly sub
poenaed to appear and show cause, shall fail to appear and show cause for such
default; and the justice may issue an attachment for such witness, as a circuit court
may do in like case.
2407 (2248). Form of entry on default of witness.—The judgment nisi against
a defaulting witness, may be in the following form, viz. :
595

2408-2410

ing to law."
2408 (2249). Form of scire facias for witness.—The scire facias to be issued
by the justice for a defaulting witness may be as follows, viz.:
" The State of Mississippi.
" To any lawful officer of
county:
" This is to command you to make known to
that a judgment in favor of

county, for his default in not appearing before me, at

" Witness my hand, the
day of

."
The part in brackets should be omitted, if it be not intended that the witness
shall be discharged on bail, but shall be brought before the court by the officer.
An attachment and scire facias for a defaulting witness may be combined in one writ,
and when the witness is before the justice of the peace in pursuance of such pro
cess, the judgment nisi shall be made final, if good cause to the contrary be not
shown.
2410 (2252). Form of entry of judgment in such case.—The entry of final

action shall, on or before the return-day of the summons, and before the trial of the
case, file with the justice of the peace the evidence of debt, statement of account,
or other written statement of the claim, if any, which he may desire to and which
lawfully may be set off against the demand of the plaintiff, and, in default thereof,
he shall not be permitted to use it on the trial. (See annotations to § 687.)
The defendant may prove a set-off greater in amount than the jurisdiction of the justice, if the balance,
after deducting the amount of the plaintiff's demand, do not exceed his jurisdiction. Glass v. Moss, 1 How.
(Miss.), 519.
2412 (2205). Trial and judgment, and execution.—On the return-day of the
summons the justice shall hear and determine the cause if the parties appear; give
judgment by default if the defendant fail to appear and contest plaintiff's demand,
or judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiff if he fail to prosecute his claim; enter
judgment in favor of the defendant where, in case of set-off, it shall appear that
there is a balance due him, for the amount of such balance, and issue execution
against the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the party against whom
judgment is rendered, for the amount of the judgment and costs, or costs alone,
as the case may require, returnable to a term of the court to be held more than
twenty days after the rendition of the judgment, and not more than six months
after the issuance of the execution ; and the execution may be directed to the proper
officer of any county in this state.
For an example of a judgment of a justice of the peace questioned and held sufficient, see Swain v.
Gilder, 61 Miss., 667.
2413 (2206). Judgment a lien if enrolled.—Judgments rendered by justices
of the peace shall operate as a lien upon the property, real or personal, of the defend
ant or defendants therein, found or situated in the county where rendered, or in any
other county where the same may be, which is not exempt by law from execution,
if an abstract of the judgment be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the
county wherein the property is situated, and entered upon the judgment-roll, as in
other cases of enrolled judgments, the lien to commence from the date of enroll
ment; and the judgment may be enrolled and have the force and effect of a lien in
all cases where an appeal is taken, as well as in other cases. And in the event of a
reversal of the judgment of the justice's court, the clerk of the circuit court shall
.enter a memorandum to that effect on the judgment- roll.
2414 (2207). Execution not to be issued within five days.—An execution
shall not issue on any judgment of a justice of the peace until five days after its
rendition, unless the party recovering therein shall make and file an affidavit that

" Witness my hand, the

; serv
ing summons, $
," etc.
2416 (2212). Replevin, attachment, liens, etc.—Proceedings in replevin,
attachment, trial of a claim to property levied on, and for the enforcement of statu
tory liens before justices of the peace, shall be, as far as practicable, according to
those in the circuit courts, in all like cases. (See §§ 176, 177, 2684, 2707, 2713, 2716,
2720, 2723.)
2417 (2213). Judgment on merits res adjudicata.—When any suit brought
before a justice of the peace shall be iinally decided on its merits by the justice, it
shall be a bar to a recovery for the same cause of action or set-off in any other suit.
2418 (2214). Execution of judgment may be stayed.—If the party against
whom judgment is given, shall, within five days thereafter, procure some responsi
ble person to appear before the justice, and in writing, to be entered on the docket
of the justice and signed by such person, consent to become surety therefor, the jus
tice shall grant a stay of execution for thirty days from the date of the judgment
on all sums not exceeding fifty dollars, and for sixty days on all sums over fifty dol

2420 (2216). Criminal jurisdiction.—Justices of the peace shall have jurisdic

their several districts whereof the punishment prescribed does not extend beyond
a fine and imprisonment in the county jail; but if there be not a justice of the
peace in the district in which any crime is committed qualified to try the accused,
any justice of the peace of the county shall have jurisdiction thereof.
2421 (2217). Practice in criminal cases.—On affidavit of the commission ot
any crime of which he has jurisdiction lodged with a justice of the peace, he shall
issue a warrant for the arrest of the offender, returnable forthwith or on a certain
day to be named, and shall issue subpoenas for witnesses as in civil cases, and shall
try and dispose of the case according to law ; and, on conviction, shall order such
punishment to be inflicted as the law provides.
An affidavit is essential to confer jurisdiction to try and punish an offender. Bighara v. Stat?, 59
Miss., 529.
2422 (2218). Convict committed to jail.—It shall be the duty of a justice of
the peace to order any one found guilty by him who shall not immediately pay the

598

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

2423-2427

2423 (2220). Bail for appearance for trial may be taken. —It is lawful for any
officer having a person in custody by virtue of a warrant of a justice of the peace,
in a case of which the justice has final jurisdiction, to take bond, with sufficient
sureties, in a sum of not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars,
conditioned for the appearance of such person, on the return-day of the writ, before
the justice of the peace before whom the warrant is returnable, and to fix the
amount of the bond, which shall be returned to the justice and be filed and pro
ceeded on by him in case of forfeiture, if for not more than two hundred dollars,
as in like cases in the circuit court, as near as may be ; and a justice of the peace
before whom any person is brought for trial may take bond or recognizance, in such
like sum as he may fix, of such person, or may authorize the sheriff or constable to
take bond of him, for his appearance on adjournment from time to time and from
day to day, or to a subsequent day, for trial, and to be proceeded on in case of for
feiture as provided above. When a bond or recognizance shall exceed in its pen
alty two hundred dollars and be forfeited, the justice of the peace shall return the
bond or a true copy of the recognizance to the circuit court, with his certificate of
the forfeiture; and the circuit court shall enter judgment nisi thereon, and there
after proceed as if the same had been for appearance in that court.
2424 (2221). Justice not finally dispose of certain cases.—If on the trial of
any criminal case the justice of the peace discover that it is a felony, and not a
misdemeanor, of which the accused has been guilty, he shall not punish the offender
nor render any judgment finally disposing of the case, but shall require him to give
bail for his appearance in the circuit court, unless the felony be not bailable, in
which case the justice shall commit him without bail.
The affidavit charging an offense serves to procure the arrest of the accused; and if the justice believe
him guilty of a felony, he must bind him over, and the mittimus will be valid, although the affidavit only charge
a misdemeanor. Ex parte Burke, 58 Miss., 50.
2425 (2222). Trial by jury.—On or before the return-day of the process either
party may demand a trial by jury, and thereupon the justice of the peace shall
order the proper officer to summon six persons, competent to serve as jurors in the
.circuit court, to appear immediately, or at such early day .as he may appoint, whether
at a regular term or not, who shall be sworn to try the case ; but each party shall be
entitled to challenge peremptorily two jurors, and as many more as he can show
sufficient cause for. If a sufficient number of jurors shall not appear, others may
be summoned until a jury is made up, to consist of six, against whom legal objec
tions shall not exist. If the jury fail to agree, it may be discharged and another
jury summoned, and so on until a verdict is obtained; and judgment shall be
entered by the justice on the verdict.
2426 (2224). The same; if more than one case.—If a justice have more jury
cases than one on the same day, he shall use the same jury for the trial of each,
subject to the right of challenge by either party and like proceedings in all respects
as in other cases. If more cases than one be tried by the same jury, the justice
shall apportion the cost of the jury among the several cases and tax it in accord
ance with justice.
2427 (2225). The same; delinquent jurors fined.—The justice of the peace
may fine any person summoned as a juror failing to attend in any sum not exceed
599

2428—2432

ing ten dollars; and if such person, when summoned to show cause why the fine
should not he made final, shall not appear and show cause, execution shall issue for
the fine and cost.
2428 (2226). The same; in criminal cases. —A defendant in a criminal case
before a justice of the peace may, in like manner as in civil cases, demand a jury,
and thereupon the justice shall proceed as in other cases.
2429 (3117). Subpoena to any county.—A justice of the peace may issue a
subpoena for a witness to any county, in a criminal case, and enforce obedience
thereto.
2430 (2230). To collect and report fines, etc. —It shall be the duty of every
justice of the peace to receive and account for all fines and penalties imposed by
him, and, on the first day of October and April in each year, to report in writ
ing, under oath, to the clerk of the board of supervisors all fines and penalties
imposed by him during the six months next preceding such report, giving the date,
amount, and names of persons from whom such fines and penalties were received,
and to pay so much thereof as he shall have received to the county treasurer. Any
justice of the peace who shall fail to make such report or to pay the money so
received, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor in office, and, on conviction thereof, shall
be removed from office, and also may be fined and imprisoned.
2431 (2229). Remedy for money collected.—When any justice of the peace
shall have collected in his official capacity any money, fines, or penalties, and shall
fail to pay or account for the same to the person or official entitled to receive the
same, he shall be liable to be proceeded against on his official bond in a summary
way, by motion in any court having jurisdiction of the amount collected and with
held, of which motion five days' notice shall be served on the justice of the peace
and the sureties on his bond, or such of them as may be found; and judgment for
the amount illegally withheld by the justice, and ten per centum thereon, and all
costs, shall be rendered against the justice and his sureties, or such of them as
have been served with notice. (See § 647.)
2432 (2232, 2233, 2234, 2235, 2236). Docket, etc., of justice going out of
office delivered to circuit clerk; proceedings, etc. —Every justice of the peace
whose term of ofiice shall expire, or who shall resign, remove from the district, or
otherwise go out of office, and the legal representative and next of kin of every
justice of the peace who shall die, shall, within ten days thereafter, deliver his docket,
with all process and papers and books of statutes relating to his office, to the clerk
of the circuit court of the county; and if any justice of the peace, or the legal rep
resentative and next of kin of any justice of the peace who shall die, refuse or
neglect to deliver such docket, process, papers, or books of statutes to said clerk as
required, he or they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,
shall be punished by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in
the county jail not longer than six months, or by both. Said clerk shall preserve
such books of statutes and shall keep in his office such docket, process, and papers
as public records, and shall certify copies thereof, while kept by him, whenever
demanded; and whenever a successor to the justice of the peace shall be selected
and qualified, the clerk shall deliver said docket, process, papers, and books of stat
utes to such successor, who shall proceed to conclude all business pending thereon
600

as if the proceedings had been originally instituted before him. If it be doubtful
who of several is successor to a justice of the peace whose term of office has
expired, the justice of the peace in the district who resides nearest the residence of
such justice whose term expired shall be considered his successor. "While such
docket and papers are in the custody of the clerk, if there be on said docket any
suits undetermined or any judgments unexecuted, any justice of the peace of the
county, at the request of either party thereto, and 011 five days' notice to the
adverse party, shall have access to the docket and papers, and shall hear and deter
mine such suits and execute any judgment on said docket in the same manner as
business originally begun by him.

CHAPTER 70.
LAND AND CONVEYANCES.
2433 (1187). Land conveyed to vest immediately or in future.—Any interest
in or claim to land may be conveyed, to vest immediately or in the future, by writ
ing signed and delivered; and such writing shall have the effect to transfer, accord
ing to its terms, the title of the person signing and delivering it, with all its inci
dents, as fully and perfectly as if it were transferred by feoffment with livery of
seizin, notwithstanding there may be an adverse possession thereof.
This section practically abolishes the doctrine of champerty in reference to lands. Cassedy v. Jackson,
45 Miss., 397.
2434 (1188). Land conveyed only by writing.—An estate of inheritance or
freehold, or for a term of more than one year, in lands shall not be conveyed from
one to another unless the conveyance be declared by writing signed and delivered.
(See § 4225, paragraph c.)
Real estate cannot be passed or incumbered for a longer period than one year by a mere deposit of the
title-deeds. Gothard v. Flynn, 25 Miss., 58.
A verbal lease of land to begin at a future fixed time, and to continue not more than one year, is valid.
McCroy v. Toney, G6 Miss., 233.
The section does not prevent the vesting of the title to lands by virtue of an adverse possession for the
statutory period, though the holding were begun under a parol gift or purchase. Davis v. Davis, 68 Miss., 478.
2435 (1189). Words of inheritance not necessary.—Every estate in lands
granted, conveyed, or devised, although the words deemed necessary by the com
mon law to transfer an estate of inheritance be not added, shall be deemed a feesimple if a less estate be not limited by express words, or unless it clearly appear
from the conveyance or will that a less estate was intended to be passed thereby.
2436 (1190). Estates in fee-tail prohibited.—Estates in fee-tail are prohibited ;
and every estate which, but for this statute, would be an estate in fee-tail, shall be
an estate in fee-simple ; but any person may make a conveyance or a devise of lands
to a succession of donees then living, not exceeding two, and to the heirs of the
body of the remainder-man, and, in default thereof, to the right heirs of the donor,
in fee-simple.
8ee Powell v. Brandon, 24 Miss., 343; Jordan v. Roach, 32 Miss., 481; Dibrell v. Carlisle, 48 Miss., 691.
2437 (1194). How corporation may convey land.—All bodies-politic or cor
porate may convey their lands by and under the corporate seal and the signature of

purchaser without notice, and is enforceable in a court of chancery. Archibald v. Citizens' Bank, 64 Miss.,
523.
2727 (1396). Duration of lien.—The lien hereby created shall expire six months
after the claim is due, unless judicial proceedings have been commenced to assert it.

CHAPTER 82.
LIGHT.
2728. Contracts for.—The board of public contracts shall make contracts
annually, or at such times and on such terms as it may deem best for the public
interest, for gas-lights or electric lights for the capitol and the public institutions,
at a price not greater than individuals or private institutions in Jackson pay for
like lights and appliances.
2729. Use of lights in the capitol. —The lights in the capitol shall not be used
by any private person, or for any secret or private purpose, party caucuses excepted,
but may be used, in the discretion of the keeper of the capitol, for any public meet
ing of citizens.

CHAPTER 83.
LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.
2730 (2664). Actions concerning land.—A person may not make an entry or
commence an action to recover land but within ten years next after the time at
which the right to make the entry or to bring the action shall have first accrued to
some person through whom he claims; or, if the right shall not have accrued to any
person through, whom he claims, then within ten years next after the time at which
the right to make the entry or bring the action shall have first accrued to the per
son making or bringing the same ; but if, at the time at which the right of any
person to make an entry or to bring an action to recover land shall have first accrued,
such person shall have been under the disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind,
then such person or the person claiming through him may, notwithstanding the
period of ten years hereinbefore limited shall have expired, make an entry or bring
an action to recover the land at any time within ten years next after the time at
which the person to whom the right shall have first accrued shall have ceased to
be under either disability, or shall have died, whichever shall have first happened;
but when any person who shall be under either of the disabilities mentioned, at the
time at which his right shall have first accrued, shall depart this life without having
ceased to be under such disability, no time to make an entry or to bring an action
to recover the land beyond the period of ten years next after the time at which
654

such person shall have died, shall be allowed, by reason of the disability of any
other person.
It is competent to join one adverse possession to another in order to make the bar effectual, if the pos
session be continued, uninterrupted, and adverse during the whole period. Benson v. Stewart, 30 Miss., 49.
The principle upon which the statute rests, is not that the party in whose favor it is evoked has set up an
adverse claim for the period prescribed, but that the adverse claim is accompanied by such an invasion of the
rights of the opposite party as to give him a cause of action. Magee v. Magee, 37 Miss., 138.
Actual, open, and notorious possession may be shown by the acts of the occupant to have been adverse.
Davis v. Bowmar, 55 Miss., 671.
The statute commences to run from the time plaintiff's cause of action accrued, and not from the date
the title vests in him. Shaw v. Alexander, 32 Miss., 229.
What constitutes adverse possession is a question of law, but the intention of the possessor, which is
always material in determining, is a fact to be ascertained by the jury. Magee v. Magee, 37 Miss., 138.
Visible and notorious occupation, with intent to claim against the world, constitute adverse possession.
So will any visible aets of ownership exercised over land, which, from their nature, indicate notorious claim of
property in it, if continued for a longtime, with the knowledge of the owner, and without interruption or
adverse entry by him. Neither actual occupation, residence, nor cultivation is necessary to constitute adverse
possession, where the property is so situated, as not to admit of any permanent useful improvement. Ford v.
Wilson, 35 Miss , 490.
The adverse possession, to be available, must have been continuous. Tegarden v. Carpenter, 36 Miss.,
404; Nixon v. Porter, 3S Miss., 401.
A void deed is sufficient to constitute color of title. One who enters under color of title and holds
adversely may extend his possession to the whole laud embraced in his deed. But a mere intruder can extend
his possession only to the extent of his actual occupancy. Welborn v. Anderson, 37 Miss., 155; Ryan v.
Mississippi R. R. Co., 62 Miss., 162.
A defendant having color of title is not a mere intruder. Nixon v. Porter, 38 Miss., 401.
Where the right of action has descended from one dying under disability to another resting under disa
bility, ten years only is given from the death of the first person within which the second may sue. Watts v.
Gunn, 53 Miss., 502.
Unless the declaration show the character of defendant's possession and the length of time he have so
occupied the premises, the bar of the statute cannot be raised by demurrer. Tush-ho-yo-tubby v. Barr, 41
Miss., 52.
Adverse possession, though uuder a parol gift, if it continue for ten years, confers a perfect title. Davis
v. Davis, 68 Miss., 478.
2731 (2665). Same limitation as to suits in equity.—A person claiming land
in equity may not bring suit to recover the same but within the period during
which, by A'irtue of the provisions hereinbefore contained, he might have made an
entry or brought an action to recover the same if he had been entitled at law to
such estate, interest, or right in or to the same as he shall claim therein in equity;
but in every case of a concealed fraud, the right of any person to bring suit in
equity for the recovery of land, of which he or any person through whom he claims
may have been deprived by such fraud, shall be deemed to have first accrued at and
not before the time at which the fraud shall, or, with reasonable diligence might,
have been first known or discovered. (See § 2749; see also § 2762.)
2732 (2666). Mortgages and deeds of trust.—When a mortgagee, after con
dition broken, shall obtain the actual possession or receipt of the profits or rent of
land embraced in his mortgage, the mortgageor, or any person claiming through
him, may not bring a suit to redeem the mortgage but within ten years next after
the time at which the mortgagee obtained such possession or receipt, unless in the
meantime an acknowledgment of the title of the mortgageor, or of his right of
redemption, shall have been given in writing, signed by the mortgagee or the per
son claiming through him; and in such case a suit may not be brought but
within ten years next after the time at which such acknowledgment, or the last
of such acknowledgments, if more than one, was given ; but such acknowledgment
655

shall be effectual only as against, and to the extent of the interest of the party
signing it.
A husband mortgaged his lands; the mortgagee without foreclosure conveyed to the wife, who thereafter
occupied for ten years; she thereby acquired a perfect title. Little v. Teague, 60 Miss., 115.
2733 (2667). Remedy on mortgage barred when debt is.—When a mortgage
or deed of trust shall be given on real or personal estate, or when a lien shall be
given by law to secure the payment of a sum of money specified in any writing,
an action or suit or other proceeding shall not be brought or had upon such lien,
mortgage, or deed of trust to recover the sum of money so secured but within the
time that may be allowed for the commencement of an action at law upon the
writing in which the sum of money secured by such mortgage or deed of trust may
be specified ; and in all cases where the remedy at law to recover the debt shall be
barred, the remedy in equity on the mortgage shall be barred.
Where the debt is barred, the mortgage cannot be enforced. Huntington v. Bobbit, 46 Miss., 528; Mad
dux v. Jones, 51 Miss., 531.
2734 (2668). Ten years' adverse possession gives title.—Ten years' actual
adverse possession by any person claiming to be .the owner for that time of any
laud, uninterruptedly continued for ten years by occupancy, descent, conveyance, or
otherwise, in whatever way such occupancy may have been commenced or contin
ued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and com
plete title, saving to persons under the disability of minority or unsoundness of
mind the right to sue within ten years after the removal of such disability, as pro
vided in the first section of this chapter ; but the saving in favor of persons under
disability of unsoundness of mind shall never extend longer than thirty-one years.
The ten years occupation, as declared xti the statute, vests a "full and complete title," upon which the
land can be recovered in ejectment, withoutTurther evidence than the facts showing such possession. Ellis v.
Murray, 28 Miss., 129; Ford v. Wilson, 35 Miss., 490; Davis v. Bowmar, 55 Miss., 671.
And this is true under the general statute of limitation. Jones v. Brandon, 59 Miss., 585.
Adverse possession, though under a parol gift, if it continue for ten years, confers a perfect title. Davis
v. Davis, 68 Miss., 478.
2735 (539). Three years actual occupation under a tax-title bars suitActual occupation for three years, after two years from the day of sale of land held
under a conveyance by a tax-collector in pursuance of a sale for taxes, shall bar any
suit to recover such land or assail such title because of any defect in the sale of the
land for taxes, or in any precedent step to the sale, saving to minors and persons of
unsound mind the right to bring suit within such time, after the removal of their
disabilities, and upon the same terms as is provided for the redemption of laud by
such persons.
The statute cannot be availed of where the occupant could not, if his tax-title were perfect, assert it
against the claimant of the land. McGee v. Holmes, 63 Miss., 50.
The section applies as well to a purchaser from the state of tax-lands as to a purchaser from the taxcollector. Pipes v. Farrar, 64 Miss., 514.
The statute does not apply to land held under the conveyance of a clerk of the circuit court, made under
acts 1872 and 1873 (Laws 1872, p. 9, and Laws 1873, p. 91), where there is no evidence that such land is held
immediately or remotely under a conveyance by a tax-collector. Clay v. Moore, 65 Miss., 81.
The statute was never intended to defeat a subsequently acquired tax-title. Lewis v. Seibles, 65 Miss., 251.
The statute applies to sales made before as well as after its enactment, and to apparent as well as real
delinquents. Patterson v. Durfey, 68 Miss., 779.
As to the curative effect of statutes like above, see Nevin v. Bailey, 62 Miss., 433; Gibson v. Berry, 66
Miss., 515; Sigman v. Lundy, 66 Miss., 522 ; Metcalfe v. Perry, 66 Miss., 68.

The section does not apply to an action against a city to recover money illegally coerced as a privilege
tax. Musgrove v. Jackson, 59 Miss., 390.
The verbal acknowledgment of the correctness of an account, making it an account stated, will not avoid
the statute applicable to open accounts. Floyd v. Pearce, 57 Miss., 140.
2740 (2671). When statute commences to run on open accounts.—In all
actions brought to recover the balance due upon a mutual and open current account,
where both parties are merchants or traders, the cause of action shall be deemed to
have accrued at the time of the true date of the last item proved in such account;
and in all other actions upon open accounts, the period of limitation shall commence
to run against the several items thereof from the dates at which the same respect
ively became due and payable.
It is competent to show, by custom of merchants, that when cash is not paid for merchandise the sale is
on a credit for a certain time. Effinger v. Henderson, 33 Miss., 449.
A local usage as to time of payment may be so well known that it will be implied into a contract unless
a different time were agreed. Hunter v. Wilkinson, 44 Miss., 721 ; Hendricks v. Robinson, 66 Miss., 694.
Cash payments upon an open account will not create a " mutual and open current account." Abbey v.
Owens, 57 Miss., 810.
If a merchant sell supplies to his customer, and receive from him cotton, which he sells for him and
credits the net proceeds of the cotton to the account against the customer for supplies, the account thus kept
will be a " mutual and open current account." (This can now only apply where both parties are merchants
or traders.) Abbay v. Hill, 64 Miss., 340.

When the statute ia once pnt in motion, it is not arrested by any subsequent disability; nothing but a

Davis, 38 Miss., 218; Buckingham v. Walker, 48 Miss., 609; Sivley v. Summers, 57 Miss., 712.
The six months within which executors and administrators cannot be sued {'i 1922) should not be com

2748 (2678). Absence from the state. —If, after any cause of action have
accrued in this state, the person against whom it has accrued be absent from and
reside out of the state, the time of his absence shall not be taken as any part of the
time limited for the commencement of the action, after his return.
The reason of the exception is, that during such absence the plaintiff cannot sue If the right to sue be
unimpaired, notwithstanding the absence, the case is not within the section. French v. Davis, 38 Miss., 218.
The fact that the debtor has property liable to attachment is immaterial ; " the statute follows the person,
and not the property of the debtor." Fisher v. Fisher, 43 Miss., 212.
If the debtor have a home in this state, so that service of process can be had on him under our laws, by
leaving with a member of his family or posting a copy, his absence on a trip abroad will not be within the
section. Dent v. Jones, 50 Miss., 265.
If he have no such residence here, and be absent, the section applies, even though it be shown that the
debtor had not acquired a domicile or fixed residence abroad. State v. Furlong, 60 Miss., 839.
The statute of limitations does not run during a debtor's absence from the state as a non-resident; and
this rule is applicable, though the plaintiff be non-resident. Bower v. Henshaw, 56 Miss., 619.
A person who, after a cause of action accrues against him, removes and resides out of the state is entitled
to the benefit of the time spent here on subsequent visits which are open, notorious, and long enough for suit;
but such person cannot claim that because of such visits his subsequent absences are to be disregarded.
Withers v. Bullock, 53 Miss., 539 ; Pindell v. Harris, 57 Miss., 739.
The statute embraces all persons; there is no saving. Hodges v. Darden, 51 Miss., 199.
2749 (2679). Concealed fraud.—If a person liable to any personal action
shall fraudulently conceal the cause of action from the knowledge of the person
entitled thereto, the cause of action shall be deemed to have first accrued at, and
not be*fore, the time at which such fraud shall be, or with reasonable diligence
might have been, first known or discovered. (See § 2731.)
Where the fraud itself is the basis of the right of action, unless a relation of trust and confidence exist
between the parties, the defendant must have been guilty of some positive act of fraudulent representation or
concealment directly towards the party injured. Buckner v. Calcote, 23 Miss., 432; Edwards v. Gibbs, 39
Miss , 166; State v. Furlong, 60 Miss., 839.
Where the matter is of record, and the party complaining has the means of finding out the character of
the transaction, the statute does not apply. Fleming v. Grafton, 54 Miss., 79.
2750 (2680). Lien of judgments limited.—A judgment or decree rendered in any
court held in this state shall not be a lien on the property of the defendant therein
for a longer period than seven years from the rendition thereof, unless an action be

filed within two years next after the date of the final decree in the cause, and not
after, saving to persons under disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind the
like period of two years after the removal of their disability.
A suit in equity to vacate a decree, on the ground that it was instituted in plaintiff's name and prosecuted
without her consent or knowledge, is analogous to a bill of review, and is barred in two years. Brooks v.
Spann, 63 Miss., 198.
2752 (2682). Appeals to the supreme court limited.—Appeals to the supreme
court shall be taken within two years next after the rendition of the judgment or
decree complained of, and not after, saving to persons under disability of infancy or
unsoundness of mind the like period after their disability shall have been removed.

may be commenced by or against the executor or administrator of the deceased
person, after the expiration of said time, and within one year after the death of
such person.

v. Reynolds, 58 Miss., 243; Hambrick v. Jones, 64 Miss., 240; Weir v. Monahan, 67 Miss., 434.
2754 (2684). Action barred in another state barred here. —When a cause of
action has accrued in some other state or in a foreign country, and by the law of
such state or country, or of some other state or country where the defendant has
resided before he resided in this state, an action thereon cannot be maintained by
reason of lapse of time, an action thereon shall not be maintained in this state.
2755 (2685). Completion of limitation extinguishes right.—The completion of
the period of limitation herein prescribed to bar any action, shall defeat and
extinguish the right as well as the remedy; but the former legal obligation shall be
a sufficient consideration to uphold a new promise based thereon.
2756 (2686). New action after abatement, reversal, etc. —If in any action,
duly commenced within the time allowed, the writ shall be abated, or the action
otherwise avoided or defeated, by the death of any party thereto, or for any matter
of form, or if, after verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment shall be arrested, or if a
judgment for the plaintiff shall be reversed on appeal, the plaintiff may commence
a Hew action for the same caflse, at any time within one year after the abatement
or other determination of the original suit, or after reversal of the judgment therein ;
and his executor or administrator may, in case of his death, commence such new
action, within the said one year.
The section does not abridge the time of limitation, but enlarges it; a second suit may be brought after
the expiration of the year if the general statute do not bar. Lang v. Fatheree, 7 Smed. & M., 404.
The right given is to the parties to the first suit, and not to different parties. Ross v. Sims, 27 Miss., 359.
The section applies to suits in equity as well as law. Weathersly v. Weathersly, 31 Miss., 662.
The section does not apply where the judgment in favor of plaintiff is reversed, and the supreme court
re-establishes a verdict for the defendant and dismisses the suit. Wilkes v. Coopwood, 39 Miss., 348.
A suit dismissed for want of security for costs is not within the section. Memphis R. R. Co. v. Orr, 52
Miss., 541.
2756a (2687). Limitation of set-off.—AH the provisions of this chapter shall
apply to the case of any debt or demand on the contract, alleged by way of set-off
on the part of a defendant; and the time of limitation of such debt or demand
shall be computed in like manner as if an action had been commenced therefor at
the time when the plaintiff's action was commenced; and the fact that a set-off
is barred shall not preclude the defendant from using it as such if he held it against
the debt sued on before it was barred.
2757 (2688). New promise to be in writing.—In actions founded upon any
contract, an acknowledgment or promise shall not be evidence of a new or continu
ing contract whereby to take any case out of the operation of the provisions of this
chapter or to deprive any party of the benefit thereof, unless such acknowledgment
or promise be made or contained by or in some writing signed by the part}7 charge
able thereby ; and where there shall be two or more joint contractors, one or more of
them sliall not lose the benefit of the provisions of this chapter so as to be charge
able, by reason only of an acknowledgment or promise made or signed by any other
or others of them. And in actions against joint contractors, if the plaintiff be barred

others of them, by virtue of a new acknowledgment or promise, or otherwise, judg
ment shall be given for the plaintiff' as to any of the defendants against whom he is
entitled to recover, and for the other defendants against the plaintiff.
An acknowledgment of an indefinite balance will not save the bar as to any amount whatever. Mask v.
Philler, 32 Miss., 237.
The new promise need not express the exact amount due, but must specify the particular debt, admit its
justice, and indicate an intention to pay it; but the expression of an intent to pay is not necessary if the jus:
tice of the debt be admitted without reservation. Hart v. Boyt. 54 Miss., 547.
The indorsement of a credit on a note, though signed by both parties, is not a sufficient acknowledgment
of the balance. Davidson v. Harrisson, 33 Miss., 41.
An acknowledgment is sufficient though the writing do not embody an express promise; and an acknowl
edgment and an agreement to waive the limitation will revive the debt previously barred. Beasley v. Evans,
35 Miss., 192.
The following writings were held sufficient, viz. :
(1) "I hereby waive the statute of limitations as to the within note and the deed of trust to secure the
same; " indorsed on the back of the note. Bowmar v. Peine, 64 Miss., 99.
(2) " Credit' this on my note in the county treasury. I will be down soon to pay the balance." Written
by a debtor of the county to the treasurer. Heflin v. Kinard, 67 Miss , 522.
(3) "We do hereby agree and promise to renew the note for which this mortgage is given, and to give a
new mortgage whenever the exact amount due upon said note is ascertained ; " indorsed on the back of the
mortgage. Hart v. Boyt, 54 Miss., 547.
The following writings were held insufficient, viz.:
(1) "It will ouit my convenience to execute my note for the balance due for rent, payable July 1, 1877."
Trustees v. Gilman,*55 Miss., 148.
(2) " I wrote to Mr. M. about the 1st inst. to know how I should send the money, and have not heard from
him. I am going to Aberdeen to-morrow, and will send fifty dollars, which is all I can spare at present."
Eckford v. Evans, 56 Miss., 18.
(3) "After hands are paid, appropriate balance due on my account to yourself. I would like to come
there and do your work, so I could pay you what I owe you." Fletcher v. Gillan, 62 Miss., 8.
The verbal acknowledgment of an account's correctness, making it an account stated, will not avoid the
statute applicable to open accounts. Floyd v. Pearce, 57 Miss., 140.
2758 (2690). Not to apply to issues of moneyed corporations.—None of the
provisions of this chapter shall apply to suits brought to enforce payment of notes,
bills, or evidences of debt issued by any bank or moneyed corporation.
Notes issued by a railroad company in 1861 and 1862, made payable on demand, and which could not be
re-issued as currency after one year from the close of the then existing war, are not within the saving of the
section. Butts v. Vicksburg R. R. Co., 63 Miss., 462.
2758a (2691). Statute not to run when person prohibited to sue.—"When
any person shall be prohibited by law, or restrained or enjoined by the order, decree,
or process of any court in this State from commencing or prosecuting any action or
remedy, the time during which such person shall be so prohibited, enjoined, or
restrained, shall not be computed as any part of the period of time limited by this
chapter for the commencement of such action.
2759 (2692). When the limitation to commence.—The several periods of
limitation prescribed by this chapter shall commence from the date when it shall
take effect ; but the same shall not apply to any actions commenced, nor to any
cases where the right of action or of entry shall have accrued, before that time, but
the same shall be subject to the laws now in force ; but this law may be pleaded in
any case where a bar has accrued under the provisions thereof.
For application of like sections in former revisions of the statute, see Carothers v. Hurley, 41 Miss , 71 ;
Jacks v. Bridewell, 51 Miss., 881 ; Bridgeforth v. Payne, 62 Miss., 777; Hambrick v. Jones, 64 Miss., 240.
2760 (2693). Actions for property sold by order of court.—An action shall

where the sale is in good faith and the purchase-money paid, unless brought within
two years after possession taken by the purchaser under such sale of the property.
The section applies to invalidities which have crept into sales made in good faith, where the purchasemoney has been paid. Richardson v. Brooks, 52 Miss., IIS.
The section was meant to cure all defects, no matter from what cause, whether before or after decree,
unless suit for the land be brought within the prescribed time. Morgan v. Hazlehurst Lodge, 53 Miss., 665.
And is applicable in case the court were without jurisdiction to appoint the guardian who made the sale.
Hall v. Wells, 5-1 Miss., 289; Jeffreys v. Dowdle, 61 Miss., 504.
Or even if notice were not given to the parties defendant. Summers v. Brady, 56 Miss., 10.
The burden is on the purchaser to show that the sale was made in good faith and the purchase-money
paid, etc. The good faith of a purchaser from a purchaser has nothing to do with the operation of the sec
tion. Jeffreys v. Dowdle, 61 Miss., 504.
Where the»proceedings are regular on the record, even if the sale were not in good faith, yet if the land
has passed to a bona fide purchaser, he acquires title independently of the section. Sanders v. Sorrell, 65
Miss., 288.
The section applies as well to fales made in disregard of the constitution as to those in violation of stat
utes. Brady v. Villere, 66 Miss., 399.
2761 (2694). Trustee barred; beneficiaries barred.—When the legal title to
property or a right in action is in an executor, administrator, guardian, or other
trustee, the time during which any statute of limitations runs against such trustee
shall be computed against the person beneficially interested in such property or
right in action, although such person may be under disability and within the saving
of any statute of limitations; and may be availed of in any suit or miction by such
person.
2762 (2695). Suits in equity.—Whenever there be a concurrent jurisdiction in
the courts of common law and in the courts of equity of any cause of action, the
provisions of this chapter limiting a time for the commencement of a suit for such
cause of action in a court of common law, shall applj- to all suits to be brought for
the same cause in a court of chancery. (See § 2731.)
2763 (2696). Limitation of express trusts.—Bills for relief, in case of the
existence of a trust not cognizable by the courts of common law and in all other
cases not herein provided for, shall be filed within ten years after the cause thereof
shall accrue and not after; saving, however, to all persons under disability of
infancy or unsoundness of mind, the like period of time after such disability shall
be removed; but the saving in favor of persons under disability of unsoundness of
mind shall never extend longer than thirty-one years.
A legacy which is made by the will an express charge on real estate devised, is subject to the sectionTempleton v. Tompkins, 45 Miss., 424.
The section does not run until there be a cause of action. Hence, it does not run in cases of express
trusts which are subsisting and acknowledged. Cooper v. Cooper, 61 Miss., 676.
A will which expressly charges the estate with the payment of debts, makes the debts, subject only to the
statute of limitation in relation to trusts, not cognizable in courts of law. Abbay v. Hill, 64 Miss., 340.
2763« (2689). How this chapter to be applied.—The provisions of this chapter
shall not apply to any suit which is or shall be limited by any statute to be brought
within a shorter time than is prescribed in this chapter, but such suit shall be
brought within the time that may be limited by such statue.

facts as to each case shall be carefully noted in the superintendent's register.
2845 (664). Harmless incurables and the restored, removed.—Where any
patient in an asylum shall be found to be incurable, but harmless, and such as
can be properly cared for out of the asylum, or if a patient be restored to reason,
the superintendent shall notify the sheriff of the county from which the patient
came to remove him from the asylum. On receiving such notice the sheriff shall
at once notify some near relation of the patient in his county, and, unless such rela
tion immediately remove the patient from the asylum, the sheriff shall do so. If
a patient be restored to reason, the superintendent may furnish transportation to
such patient to his home, and make requisition on the board of supervisors of the
county for the costs thereof, which shall be allowed and a warrant issued to the
superintendent of the asylum; and the board of supervisors shall proceed as herein
before provided to recover the sum so paid, but this shall not apply to pay patients.

CHAPTER 89.
. MANDAMUS.
2846 (2542). In what cases a remedy, and how obtained.—On the petition of
the state, by its attorney-general or a district attorney, in any matter affecting the
public interest, or on the petition of any private person who is interested, the writ
of mandamus shall be issued by the circuit court, commanding any inferior tribunal,
corporation, board, officer, or person to do or not to do an act the performance or
omission of which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, where there is not a plain, adequate, and speedy remedy in the
ordinary course of law.
Where a discretion is left in an inferior tribunal, the writ of mandamus can only compel it to act, but
cannot control the discretion. Madison Co. v. Alexander, Walker, oT.i : Attala Co. v. Grant, i) Smed. k M., 77 ;
Swan v. Gray, -44 Miss., 383; Vicksburg v. Rainwater, 47 Miss.. 5t7; Clayton v. McWilliams, 1!) Miss., 311;
State Board v. West Point, 50 Miss., 638; Monroe Co. v. State, 03 Miss , 135.
The governor cannot be compelled by mandamus to perform any act. Vicksburg R. R. Co. v. Lowry, 61
Miss., 102.
It is no defense to an application for a mandamus to compel the issuance of a patent to state land, that
there is an outstanding title in a stranger. Meyers v. Martin, 01 Miss., 138.
Mandamus is the proper remedy to enforce the payment of valid claims against counties, which have
been audited and allowed. Beard v. Lee Co., 51 Miss., 542; Klein v. Smith Co., 54 Miss.. 254; Jefferson Co.
v. Arrighi, 51 Miss., 067; Honea v. Monroe Co., 03 Miss., 171.
And of such a claim against a city. Kelly v. Wimberly, 01 Miss., 548.
A judge may be compelled by mandamus to sign a bill of exceptions. Williams v. Ramsey, 52 Miss., 851.
Two or more distinct rights cannot be joined in the same petition. Haskins v. Scott Co., 51 Miss., 406.
Officers and tribunals have no right to refuse to enforce a statute because it may be thought unwise, and
they may be forced by mandamus to act. Monroe Co. v. State, 63 Miss., 135.
The equitable assignee of a part of a claim against a count}- cannot by mandamus compel the supervis
ors to make an allowance aud issue a warrant in his favor. Foote v. Noxubee Co., 07 Miss.. 150.
2847 (2548). In what court petition to be filed.—The petition fpr mandamus
shall be tiled in the circuit court of the county in which the tribunal, corporation,
board, officer, or person made defendant, or some one or more of them, shall reside

in an adjoining circuit court district.
2848 (2544). What petition shall contain, and summons.—The petition for a
mandamus shall set forth the facts which constitute the plaintiff's claim for the
writ; and, upon the filing of the petition, the clerk of the circuit court shall issue

the proper officer; and served and returned as required in other actions.
2849 (2545). The pleadings and proceedings.—The petition shall stand for a
declaration, and the defendant shall plead to it as if it were an ordinary action at

cuit court shall be observed in this action ; and all issues made by the pleadings
shall be tried and disposed of as in other actions in the circuit court, and the judg
ment of the court shall be framed to meet the circumstances of the case, and costs
shall be adjudged as in other actions. The case shall be triable at the return-term.
2850 (2546). The writ; how served.—If the judgment be that a mandamus
issue, the writ shall be issued accordingly, directed to the defendant and command
ing what has been adjudged, which writ shall be executed by delivering a copy
thereof to the defendant, and the original shall be returned, with an indorsement
showing how it was executed; and it may be served by the proper officer, or by
any one who, though not an officer, shall make affidavit of the execution of such
writ.
2851 (2547). Obedience to the writ enforced.—Obedience to the judgment of
the court may be enforced by attachment, issued in term-time or in vacation by
order of the judge of the court and directed to the sheriff, returnable forthwith,
commanding him to take the body of the person in contempt by disobedience of
the writ of mandamus, and to bring him before the court or judge to be punished
for his disobedience; and the court or judge shall commit such person to the county
jail until he comply with the command of the writ, and make all such further orders
as may be necessary to compel obedience thereto, and may enforce such orders by
proper process.
2852 (2548). Orders in vacation; appeal and supersedeas.—All orders of the
judge made in vacation shall be in writing, and shall be tiled among the papers in
the case and constitute a part of the record thereof, and shall be subject to review
by the supreme court 011 appeal; and any order of the court or judge may be super
seded by the judge, or by a judge of the supreme court, on such terms as may be
deemed reasonable.
2853 (2549). Act ordered done by another in certain cases.—The court may,
instead of proceeding against the defendant by attachment, except in cases of the
performance of a public duty by a public officer, direct that the act required to be
done, be done by the plaintiff or by some other person appointed by the court at
the expense of the defendant; and, upon the act being done, the amount of the
expense may be ascertained by the court, and it may render judgment for the
amount of such expense and costs and enforce the payment thereof by execution.
2854 (2550). Temporary orders.—During the pendency of the action the court,
or judge in vacation, may make temporary orders for preventing damage or injury
to the plaintiff until the case be decided. (See § 748.)

MARRIAGE.

2855-2860

2855 (2551). Mandamus in certain cases triable in vacation.—A proceeding
by mandamus in any matter affecting the public interest, on the petition of the
state by its attorney-general or the district attorney, ma}' be tried and determined

8541, 3542, 3543.)
2856. Applicable to writs of prohibition.—All the foregoing provisions regu
lating the proceedings on the writ of mandamus shall apply, as far as the nature of
the remedy will allow, to proceedings on writs of prohibition.

CHAPTER 90.
MARRIAGE.
2857 (1145). Unlawful marriages.—Persons shall not marry within the following
degrees : The son shall not marry his grandmother, his mother, or his step-mother ;
the brother his sister; the father his daughter, or his daughter's daughter; the son
shall not marry the daughter of his father begotten of his step-mother, or his
aunt, being his father's or mother's sister.
2858 (1146). The same. —The father shall not marry his son's widow; a man
shall not marry his wife's daughter, or his wife's daughter's daughter, or his wife's
son's daughter, or the daughter of his brother or sister; and the like prohibition
shall extend to females in the same degrees; and all marriages prohibited by this
and the preceding section are incestuous and void.
2859 (1147). The same. —The marriage of a white person and a negro or
mulatto or person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood, or with a
Mongolian or a person who shall have one-eighth or more of Mongolian blood, shall
be unlawful, and such marriage shall be unlawful and void; and any party thereto,
on conviction, shall be punished as for a marriage within the degrees prohibited by
the last two sections ; and any attempt to evade this and the two preceding sections
by marrying out of this state and returning to it shall be within them.
2860 (1148). Licenses and certificates of marriage.—Marriage-licenses shall
be granted and issued by the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the

shall take from the person who applies for the license an affidavit that there is no
legal cause to obstruct the marriage for which such license is granted, which he
shall preserve as a record of his office; and if the male be under the age of twentyone years, or the female under the age of eighteen years, the consent of the parent

ian did sign a certificate there produced, giving consent to the celebration of the
marriage ; whereupon the clerk shall record the affidavit and the consent personally
given, or the certificate so proved, and issue a license and record the same, directed

the tax levied as above directly to the state treasurer, and receive license from the
auditor of public accounts.
The section applies equally to municipalities incorporated at its adoption and those thereafter incorpo
rated. Smith v. Vicksburg, 54 Miss., 615.
A privilege tax levied by a municipality, which is the same on all persons pursuing the same occupation
is not violative of the constitutional provision that " taxation shall be equal and uniform." Holberg v. Macon
55 Miss., 112.
The section does not confer power; it is restrictive. Ex parte Ferguson, 59 Miss., 13.

CHAPTER 109.
PROCESS.
3413 ( 2284). Style and date, etc.—The style of all process shall be, "The State
of Mississippi," and it shall not be necessary that any process bear teste in the name
of any judge or of any term of the court, but all process, except where otherwise
provided, shall be issued and signed by the clerk of the court, with the seal of his
office affixed, and shall bear date of the day on which the same shall be issued.
If the process be issued by another, with the clerk's consent in his name, it is sufficient. Gamble v. Trahen, 3 How. (Miss.), 32.
Process without the seal of the court, or, if there be no seal, without a statement of that fact, is bad.
Pharis v. Conner, 3 Smed. & M., 87.
3414 (1523, 1848). The summons.—A summons shall not issue in any case, at
law or in chancery, until the declaration, bill, petition, or other pleading beginning
the cause shall be filed. The process to bring in defendants, at law and in chan
cery, shall be a summons, and it shall command the officer to summon the defend
ant to appear and answer on the return-day.
3415 (1853). Names in summons.—The names of all defendants who reside
in the county where the process issues shall be included in the same summons.
3416 (1524). Duplicate writs to different counties.—If any of the defendants
reside in different counties from that in which the suit is brought, original process
may issue at the same time to each county in which any of the defendants reside,
and the clerk shall indorse on each writ issued to another county than that in which
the suit is brought the names of the defendants upon whom it is to be served, and
that it is a duplicate of a writ issued to the other county for the same cause of
action; and the sheriff shall execute and return such process as in other cases, and
under the same penalties.
Where the venue depended on the residence of the defendants, the duplicate writ was returned executed
on all of them. The writ to the county in which the suit was begun was returned " not found " as to all.
The court correctly dismissed the suit, on affidavit that all the defendants resided in the county where they were
served, and none of them where the suit was pending. Bank v. Jennings, 5 How. (Miss.), 425.
But, in such cage, if one defendant reside in the county where suit is brought, and be served with process
and plead to the action, and those in other counties are served but do not plead, the plaintiff may dismiss as
to the resident defendant and take judgment against the others. Read v. Renaud, 6 Smed. & M., 79; Chris
tian v. O'Neal, 46 Miss., 669.
3417 (1525). When summons returnable, and when to be executed in
actions at law.—The summons, in actions in the circuit court, shall be made return
able on the first day of the term, and shall be executed five days before the return
767

3418-3421

PROCESS.

day thereof; and if executed within five days before the return-day, it shall be good
to require the appearance of the party at the terra next after that to which it is
returnable ; and any summons issued within five days before the return-day, shall
be made returnable to the next succeeding term of the court after that, to be held
within five days.
If the return-term to which process has been executed, fail, so that no court be held at that term, such
term will nevertheless constitute the "appearance" term of the case, and the case will stand for trial at the
next term in the same way as if the appearance-term had been regularly held. Thornton v. Fitzhugh, 10
Smed. & M., 438.
3418 (1848). The same; in suits in chancery.—The summons, in suits in the
chancery court, may be made returnable on a rule-day in vacation, or on the first
day of the term of the court, and shall be executed five days before the return-day ;
and, if not executed five days before the return-day, it shall require the defendant
to appear and plead, demur, or answer, at the next monthly rule-day, more than five
days after service of process.
3419 (1534, 1851). Alias and pluries summons, and testatum writ.—When
the defendant shall not be found, the plaintiff, complainant, or petitioner may, in
term-time or vacation, without any order of court, sue out an alias or pluries sum
mons until the defendant be served ; or he may have a testatum writ to another
county where the defendant, after commencement of suit, shall have gone into another
county ; or he may have an attachment against the estate of the defendant ; and if,
upon such attachment, the sheriff" shall seize or attach any property of the defend
ant, the same proceedings shall thereafter be had as if the suit had been originally
commenced by attachment.
When an action has been begun in accordance with the law of venue in personal actions, and the defend
ant shall not be found, the plaintiff may have an attachment under this section ; but the record must properly
show (1) that the action was rightfully commenced, and (2) that defendant cannot be "found" in the county.
McNair v. Kaiser, 62 Miss., 783.
3420 (1852). Representative of deceased party summoned.—If a party to a
suit in any court shall die, the clerk, during the recess of the court, may on appli
cation issue process to bring into court the representative of such deceased party,
or the representative may appear voluntarily, and become a party to the suit.
An amended bill or bill of revivor in chancery is not required under this statute. Mitchell r. Conner,
42 Miss., 550.
3421 (1855). Non-resident and unknown defendants summoned by publica
tion.—If a defendant in any proceeding in a chancery court be shown by bill or
petition sworn to or by affidavit filed, to be a non-resident of this state, or not to
be found therein on diligent inquiry, and the post-office of such defendant be stated
in the bill, petition, or affidavit, or it be therein stated that it is not known to the
complainant or petitioner, or, if the affidavit be made by another for him, that such
post-office is unknown to the affiant, and he believes it is unknown to the complain
ant or petitioner, the clerk, upon the filing of the bill or petition, account, or other
commencement of a proceeding, shall prepare and publish a summons to such party
to appear and defend the suit on a rule-day or on the first day of a term of the
court, sufficiently distant in time to admit of the due publication thereof. The
summons shall be in the form following, to wit :
768

PROCESS.

3422-3424

" State of Mississippi.
"To
[the defendant] :
" You are commanded to appear before the chancery court of the county of
, in said state, on the
Monday of
, A.D.
, to defend the suit
in said court of
[and others], wherein you are a defendant.
" This
day of
, A.D.
. '
, Clerk:'
Upon proof of publication of such summons for three weeks in some newspaper
published in the county, or in a convenient county, or at the seat of government of
this state, and of the mailing of a copy of the summons to the defendant at his
post-office, where that is stated, the defendant may be thereafter proceeded against
as if he had been personally served with a summons in the case in this state.
The affidavit must comply substantially with the statute. Burks v. Burks, 6tJ Miss., 494.
3422 (1856). The same; copy mailed, etc.—It shall be the duty of the clerk to
hand the summons to the complainant or petitioner, to be published, or, at his request
and at his expense, to hand it to the publisher of the proper newspaper for publica
tion ; and, where the post-office of the absent defendant is stated, to send by mail
to the address of the defendant, at his post-office, a copy of the summons, and to
note the fact of issuing the same and mailing the copy, on the general docket ; and
this shall be the evidence of the summons having been mailed to the defendant.
And for a failure to mail the copy, or to note it on the general docket, the clerk shall
be liable to be punished by the court for contempt, and shall be liable in damages
to the party injured by the failure.
3423 (1857). Publication dispensed with if summons served.—If the sum
mons shall be served on the absent part}' by delivery to him, or, if a corporation, to
some of its officers or agents, of a copy thereof, at least ten days before the returnday, and if proof of such service be made by filing the summons in the office of the
clerk who issued it, with the acknowledgment of the defendant indorsed on or
annexed to it that it was served on him, or the like acknowledgment by an officer
or agent of a corporation made defendant, and proved to be subscribed by the
defendant or officer or agent of the corporation by the affidavit of some one annexed
thereto, or shown to have been served by one who delivered the copy or knows of
the delivery and shall make affidavit of such delivery before some officer in the
state or country where the service was made authorized to administer oaths, or
before any such officer in this state, which shall be filed among the papers in the
proceedings with the summons, or proved in open court by parol or other testimony,
to have been duly served on the defendant, and recited in a decree of the court to
have been so proved, that shall be in lieu of a publication of the summons, and
shall authorize further proceedings against the defendant as if he had been duly
summoned in this state. ■
Service of the summons out of this state will not authorize a personal judgment against a defendant who
does not appear. The process of one state cannot run into another, so as to give personal jurisdiction.
Cudabac v. Strong, 67 Miss., 705.
3424 (1858). Unknown heirs and unknown defendants.— When unknown
heirs are made parties defendant in any proceeding in the chancery court, upon
affidavit that the names of such heirs are unknown, the complainant may have
publication of summons for them, and such proceedings shall be had thereupon
769

3425-3428

PROCESS.

in all respects as are authorized in the case of non-resident defendants; and when
the parties in interact are unknown, and affidavit of that fact he filed, they may be
made parties by publication to them as unknown parties in interest.
3425. Publication in all cases. —Publication of summons in all cases and in
every court, when authorized by law, shall be made as prescribed in this chapter for
non-resident or absent defendants in chancery, unless otherwise provided.
3426 (462). Substitute for publication. —In cases in which publication of any
notice or matter prescribed by law or the order of court to be published in a news
paper, cannot be obtained for the prescribed compensation, posting of the summons,
order, citation, advertisement, or notice in three public places in the county, one of
them being at the court-house door, for the length of time publication in a newspaper
is required, and, the filing of an affidavit of the facts, shall be sufficient to dispense
with publication in a newspaper.
3427 (1527). How summons executed. —The summons from every court shall
be served in one of the following modes:
First.— Upon the defendant personally, if to be found in the county, by handing
him a true copy of the process.
Second.—If the defendant cannot himself be found in the county, then by leav
ing a true copy of the process at his usual place of abode, with his wife or some
other person above the age of sixteen years, being one of his family, and willing to
receive such copy.
Third.—If the defendant cannot himself be found, and if no person of his family,
aged sixteen years can be found at his usual place of abode who is willing to receive
such copy, then by posting a true copy on a door of the defendant's usual place of
abode.
If the officer return that he offered a true copy of the writ to defendant, who refused to receive it, and
that he tried to read it to the party, who would not hear it, the service is good. Story v. Ware, 35 Miss., 399.
A return of "executed by leaving a copy with defendant's clerk (naming him) at defendant' store, who
is above the age of sixteen, defendant having no other place of residence and not being found," is not sufficient
to sustain a judgment by default. Ford v. Coleman, 41 Miss., 651.
A return of " executed by delivering copy to son of defendant, at his residence," is not sufficient to sustain
a judgment by default. Glenn v. Wragg, 41 Miss., 654.
A return of "executed on defendant bv leaving a copy for him with his mother, a person above the age
of sixteen years, at his usual place of abode, he not being found," is not sufficient. Bustamente v. Bescher,
43 Miss , 172.
A substantial compliance with the statute is all that is necessary. Bacon v. Bevan,44 Miss., 293; Morehead v. Chaffe, 52 Miss., 161 ; Rigby v. Lefevre, 58 Miss., 639.
A return of "executed personally on the defendant by exhibiting and reading to him the contents of this
writ" is not sufficient to sustain a judgment by default French v. The Slate, 53 Miss., 651.
3428. Form of sheriff's return.—The sheriff's return on original process may
be in one of the following forms:
1. Form of personal service:
" I have this day executed the within writ personally, by delivering to the within
named defendant,
[here state name of party summoned], a true copy of this
writ.
" This, the
day of
, A.D.
.
, Sheriff:'
2. Form of service where copy left at residence:
" I have this day executed the within writ on
, the within named defendant,
by leaving a true copy of the same at his [or her] usual place of abode in my county,
770

PROCESS.

3429-3431 .-

with
, his [or her] [here insert wife, husband, son, daughter, or other person,

, a member of his [or her] family above the age of sixteen
years, and willing to receive such copy. The said defendant not found in my county.
" This, the
day of
, A.J).
.
, Sheriff."
3. Form of service when copy posted:
" I have this day executed the within writ on
, the within named defendant,
by posting a true copy of the same on a door of defendant's usual place of abode in
my county. The said defendant could not be found in my county, nor could I find
any member of said defendant's family, over the age of sixteen years, willing to
receive the same at his [or her] usual place of abode.
" This, the
day of
, A.D.
.
, Sheriff."
(a) The return should be signed by the sheriff, or in his name, even when executed
by a deputy, and, and in that case, should be signed thus : "
, sheriff, by
,
deputy sheriff."
(b) In case of several defendants in the same writ, the officer should make a
return for each.
(c) The first service should be made, if it can be; if not, then the second should
be made, if it can be ; and the return of the second service must negative the officer's
ability to make the first. If neither the first nor second service can be made, then
the third should be made, and the return thereof must negative the officer's ability
to make both the first and second.
3429 (1526). Sheriff to mark and return process.—The sheriff shall mark on
all process the day of the receipt thereof by him, and he shall return the same on
or before the return-day, with a written statement of his proceedings thereon, and
of bis fees for serving it; and for failing to note the time of the receipt of process,
or to return the same, the sheriff shall forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of one
hundred dollars, and shall be liable for all damages, and the court ma}- enforce return
of the process by fine and imprisonment for contempt; but whenever a sheriff of
any county shall receive from another county any writ or other process directed to
him, he shall not be liable for a failure to return the same to the county from which
the same was issued if he shall show to the court that he mailed the same in the
post-office, directed to the clerk of the court by whom the same was issued, at least
two days before the sitting of the court to which the same was returnable.
3430 (1530). Service when defendant is an infant.—If the defendant be an
unmarried infant, the process shall be served on him personally, and upon his father
or mother or guardian, if he have any in this state; but if he be married, process
may be served as on an adult.
A return showing personal service on an unmarried infant is insufficient, unless it also show that the
infant had no father, mother, or guardian in the county. (Not in state, as intimated in Ingersoll v. Ingersoll,
42 Miss., 155; Mulling v. Sparks, 43 Miss., 129; and Price v. Price, 44 Miss., 571.) But the fact that there is
110 father, mother, or guardian in the state must be shown otherwise than by the return, and should be recited
in the decree. Erwin v. Carson, 54 Miss., 282; Moody v. McDuff, 58 Miss., 751.
If the mother be co-defendant, and she and her infant child be summoned in one process, her relationship
appearing on the face of it, a return thereon showing that a cop}' was delivered to each will be sufficient.
Mcllvoy v. Alsop, 45 Miss., 3G5.
3431 (1531). Service when defendant is of unsound mind.—If the defendant
be a person judicially declared of unsound mind, service of process shall be on him

and also upon his guardian, if he have any; but if such defendant be an inmate of
a lunatic asylum, and the superintendent shall certify that he is mentally incapable
of responding to process, service of process on such person shall not be required,
and the certificate of the superintendent shall be indorsed on or attached to the pro
cess for such defendant, and shall be in lieu of service thereof.
In suits against lunatics both the lunatic and his guardian, if he have one, muBt be served with process.
Potts v. Hines, 57 Miss., 735.
3432. How served on county, city, etc. —In suits against a county, city, town,
or village the summons shall be executed personally, in the case of a county, on the
president or clerk of the board of supervisors, and, in the case of a city, town, or
village, on the mayor or municipal clerk. If any such officer, when served with
process, shall fail to give notice thereof to his board, he shall be liable personally
and on his bond, if he have given one, for all damages caused by failure to make
proper defense.
3433 (1529, 1035). How served and effect of when corporation a defendant.
—If the defendant bo a corporation, process may be served on the president or
other head of the corporation, upon the cashier, secretary, treasurer, clerk, or agent
of the corporation, or upon any one of the directors of such corporation; or, if the
corporation be a sleeping-car company, upon any conductor or other employe thereof;
or, if a steam-boat company, upon the captain or other officer of a boat thereof. If
no such person or persons be found in the county, then it shall be sufficient to post a
true copy of the process on the door of the office or principal place of business of
the corporation. In suits against railroad, sleeping-car, telegraph, telephone,
express, steam-boat, and insurance companies or corporations, the process may be
served on any agent, or sent to any county in which the office or principal place of
business may be located, and there served as herein directed and authorized, or may be
served on any of the foregoing officers or agents wherever found. When any writ
or process against a corporation has been returned executed, the defendant shall be
considered in court, and the action may proceed as actions against natural persons.
3434 (1532). Service on prisoner.—If the defendant be imprisoned by the
sentence or judgment of any court, either in a county, city, town, or village jail, or
in the state penitentiary, the officer to whom the process is addressed may serve it
himself, or service by the jailer or keeper of the penitentiary shall be sufficient.
3435 (1513). Service on one executor or administrator.—If there be two or
more executors or administrators of the same estate, if process cannot be served
on all of them in suits against them, service on one shall be sufficient to authorize
a judgment against all.
3436 (1519). Service on one of several partners.—In actions against partners,
some of whom are non-residents of this state or cannot be found, service of process
on such partners as may be found in this state shall be sufficient to maintain the
suit against all the partners so as to bind the assets of the partnership, and of the
individual summoned.
A judgment against all of several partners, when only one has been summoned, is erroneous as to those
not served, unless it appear by the return or elsewhere in the record that those not summoned were non-resi
dent or could not be found. Tabler v. i>rynnt, G2 Miss., 350.
3437 (1535). Scire facias issued, executed, and returned.— Writs of scire
facias may be issued to any county, and shall be executed and returned in the same
772

PROCESS.

3438-3444

manner as a summons. If the defendant be a non-resident of the state, or cannot
be found to be served with the process, the clerk may make publication requiring
the appearance of the defendant; and, on proof of publication, the court may pro
ceed as if the writ of scire facias had been served on the defendant.
The return on a scire facias showing that the writ was executed by the officer reading it to the defendant,
as not sufficient. Thomas v. State, 62 Miss., 184.
3438 (2285). Good, though not directed.—Any process appearing to be in
other respects duly served, shall be good, though not directed to any officer.
3439 (2286). Not void for certain defects.—If any matter required to be
inserted in or indorsed on any process be omitted, such process shall not on that
account be void, but it may be set aside as irregular, or amended 011 such terms as
the court shall deem proper; and the amendment may be made upon an applica
tion to set aside or quash the writ.
Where the process is made returnable to the wrong term of the court, the defect may be amended on
motion; and the appearance of the party to the motion obviates the necessity' of the amendment. Harrison
v. Bunk, 2 Smed. & M., 307.
A writ of replevin issued without seal, may be amended even on motion to quash. Spratley v. Kitchens,
05 Miss., 578.
A writ of seizure (under law of 1876) which commanded a seizure of agricultural products, but named
no defendant and contained no personal summons, was not void. Dogan v. Bloodworth, 56 Miss., 419.
Where the name of a defendant is changed, both in the declaration and writ, by the plaintiff, the writ
will not for that reason be quashed. Maxey v. Strong, 53 Miss., 280.
3440 (2287). Sheriff kept off by force— When the sheriff shall return, on
any process, that he has been kept off by force, the plaintiff may issue an alias or
pluries, as the case may be, or he may proceed in the action against the defendant
as if the process had been returned executed.
3441 (2288). Return of alias where first writ served.—If any process be exe
cuted, and for want of a return thereof other process be issued, the sheriff or other
officer shall not execute the subsequent process, but shall return the first process by
him executed, if it be in his possession, and, if it be not in his possession, he shall
return the subsequent process, with an indorsement of the execution of the first
process, and how it was executed, on which there shall be the same proceedings as
if the said first process had been duly returned.
3442 (2289). Notices in legal proceedings; by whom served.—All notices
provided for by law appertaining to actions, suits, or proceedings of any kind in
any court, shall be served and returned by the sheriff or any coustable of the county,
or the marshal of any city, town, or village therein in which such notices are to be
served, to whom such notices may be delivered for that purpose.
3443 (2291). Persons appointed by judge to execute process.—When the
sheriff and coroner are disqualified, or vacancies exist in said offices, or for other
good cause shown, the court, or the judge in vacation, or one of the judges of the
supreme court, may order process to be directed to any disinterested and proper
person, who shall thereby be authorized to execute and return the process in the
same manner, and with the same effect in law, as if such person were the sheriff of
the county. The application and order, if made in vacation, shall be in writing
and filed with the clerk.
3444. Motions against officers; summons.—In all cases where motions are
made against officers, or officers and their sureties, for neglect of official duty under
773

3445-345°

PROCESS.

any law, five days' notice shall be given by summons, to be served as in other cases ;
and this shall apply to motions against the personal representatives of a deceased
officer.
3445 (2290). When justice of peace to execute process.—If there be not a
. sheriff or coroner in any county, or if good cause of exception exist against them,,
by reason of their being parties to or interested in the suit, or otherwise, the pro
cess may be directed -to any justice of the peace of the county, who shall be bound
to execute the same, and to do all things which the sheriff would be bound to do if
no exception existed against him. And in case of any neglect or breach of such
duty, the justice shall be liable to the same penalties and subject to the same actions
and remedies as sheriffs are subject to in like cases.
Process addressed to an officer interested in the case will be quashed on timely application. McLeod v.
Harper, 43 Miss., 42.
Neither an interested sheriff nor his deputy, whether general or special, can serve the writ. Dyson v.
Baker, 54 Miss., 24.
3446 (1533). Return of officer may be questioned by parties.—The return of
the officer serving any process may, in the same action, be shown to be untrue by
either of the parties, but the officer himself shall not be permitted to question its
truth.
The statute clearly contemplates that the party objecting to the return in a pending action should plead
the facts in the nature of a plea in abatement. A mere motion to set aside should be overruled, and testimony
thereon refused. Mayfield v. Barnard, 43 Miss., 270.
Where a judgment by default has been rendered at the return-term upon a return of personal service of
a summons, apparently regular, such judgment may, at a subsequent term, be vacated by motion showing
that the return was false, and that the summons had only been served four days before its return-day ; and the
court will direct an issue of fact to try the truth of the return. ]f the motion be sustained, the suit will be a
pending one. Mayer v. Whitehead, t!2 Miss., 387.
3447. Motion to quash process an appearance.—Where the summons or cita
tion, or the service thereof, is quashed on motion of the defendant, the case may
be continued for the term, but defendant shall be deemed to have entered his
appearance to the succeeding term of the court.
3448. When an appeal by defendant an appearance.—Where a judgment or
decree is reversed on appeal taken by the defendant for the want of service, or
because of defective service of process, a new summons or citation need not be
issued or served, but the defendant shall, without such process or service, be pre
sumed to have entered his appearance to the cause in the court from which the
appeal was taken when the mandate shall be filed therein.
(The supreme court of the United States construed a statute of Texas in the language, substantially, of
the last two sections, and held that the provisions thereof were not violative of the constitution of the United
States, and did not deprive of property without due process of law. York v. Texas, 137 U. S., 15; Kauffman v. Wootters, 138 U. S., 285.)
3449 (1586). Subpoenas for witnesses.—The first process, in all causes, civil
and criminal, and in all courts, to compel the attendance of a witness, shall be a
subpoena, directed to the sheriff or to some proper officer of the county where the
witness may reside, stating the time and place for the appearance of the witness,
the parties to the cause, and the party at whose instance the witness is subpoenaed.
The names of the witnesses, if there be not exceeding six of them, residing in the
Bame county, shall be inserted in the same subpoena.
3450 (1587, 1616). Witnesses before commissioners, etc.—The clerk of the
court in which the action may be pending shall issue subpoenas for all witnesses

same may be issued by the master, commissioner, referee, or surveyor.
3451 (1587). Subpoena for witness to give depositions for use in other states.—
Any commissioner or other person appointed, or to whom a commission may be

any witness residing or being in this state, shall have power to issue subpoenas for
the witness to be examined, returnable at such time and place as the commissioner
or other person may appoint.
3452 (1594). Process for witness in other county during term.—If, during
the session of any circuit or chancery court, there shall be wanted in any case or
matter before the court, or before the grand jury, a witness who resides or may be
found in any county, and within thirty miles of the place where the court is being
held, such court may order a subpoena or attachment for such witness, directed to
the sheriff of the county in which the court is being held, and he shall execute the
process, according to its command, in the county where such witness maybe found,
and the service shall be as valid as if effected in the county in which the court is
being held; or the court may appoint some person not an officer to execute and
return such process, whose action in executing it shall be as lawful as if done by
the sheriff, and who shall be entitled to the same fees therefor as the sheriff would
be entitled to for executing the process.
3453 (1588). How subpoenas served. —Subpoenas shall be served personally as
a summons is required to be served; and the person so subpoenaed shall appear;
and if a civil suit shall be settled in vacation, notice thereof shall be given to the
witnesses, otherwise they shall be entitled to the same compensation for their sub
sequent attendance in pursuance of the subpoena as if the suit had not been settled.
3454 (1589). Attachment for witness. —If any person subpoenaed as a witness
shall fail to appear and attend as required, an attachment shall be issued by order
of the court or other authority before which he was subpoenaed to appear, return
able at such time as the court or authority may appoint; and the court or
authority shall, on ordering the attachment, direct whether the witness shall enter
into bond for his appearance, and in what sum, and whether with or without sure
ties; which bond the sheriff, or other officer by whom the attachment is executed,
is authorized to take, payable to the state. And in case the witness shall appear in
answer to the attachment, the court may discharge him therefrom, on good cause
shown, or may require him to enter into recognizance or bond for his appearance
until discharged, to testify in the cause. In case the witness shall not appear, in
pursuance of his recognizance or bond, the same proceedings shall be had as upon
the forfeiture of a recognizance in a criminal case.
3455 (1590, 1591, 1592). "Witness to attend until discharged; scire facias for
defaulters.—Every witness subpoenaed in any case, civil or criminal, shall attend,
from day to day and from term to term, without further notice, until discharged by
the court or by the party at whose instance he was subpoenaed ; and in default
thereof, he shall be fined by the court not more than five hundred dollars, and a
scire facias shall issue thereon, requiring him to appear at the next term of the
court, to show cause why the fine should not be made absolute; and, if cause
775

3456-3460

PROCESS.

be not then shown, the fine shall be made final. In -criminal cases, the court may
cause the witnesses on either side to be bound by bond or recognizance to appear
and testify until discharged.
3456 (1678). "Witness subpoenaed in vacation to appear before grand jury. —
Any district attorney or conservator of the peace may apply to the clerk of the cir
cuit court, in vacation, for writs of subpoena for any witness to attend before the
grand jury at the next term. It shall be the duty of the clerk to issue all subpoenas
thus applied for, and it shall be the duty of all witnesses subpoenaed to attend in
obedience to the command of such subpoena ; and, if they fail to appear, the fore
man of the grand jury may apply for and obtain an attachment, as in other cases of
defaulting witnesses, and such witnesses shall be liable to all the penalties to which
any defaulting witness is subject.
3457 (1679). Attachment of defaulting witnesses before grand jury.—In all
cases where process to bring witnesses before the grand jury shall be executed, and
the witness shall fail to attend, the clerk shall, on the order of the judge or appli
cation of the district attorney or any member of the grand jury, issue an attach
ment for such 'witness, returnable immediately, or, if the court shall so direct, to
the next term ; and bond may be required, and fine imposed and proceedings had
thereon as in other cases of defaulting witnesses.
3458 (1448). How supreme court process issued and returned —The clerk of
the supreme court shall issue all process which may be ordered to issue by the court
or any judge thereof ; and all process issuing from said court or on the order of any
judge thereof, or which may be returnable therein, shall be under the seal of the
court, and be signed by the clerk thereof, and may be directed to the sheriff or
other proper officer of an}- county, who shall execute and return the same accord
ing to the command thereof; and whenever any such process shall not be executed
or not returned, an alias may be issued by the clerk on the application of the per
son who sued out the former process ; and when any party to a suit pending in said

courts of law or equity, unless otherwise ordered by the court or the owner of the
judgment or decree, shall, within twenty days after the adjournment of the court
for the term, issue executions on all judgments and decrees rendered therein, and
place the same in the hands of the sheriff' of the count}7; and, if requested by such
owner, they shall issue executions directed to the sheriff of any other county, and
shall deliver the same to the owner or his attorney.
3460 (1743). How executions issued and returned.—Writs of execution shall
bear date and be issued in the same manner as original process, and shall be made
returnable on the first day of the next term of the court in which the judgment or
decree was rendered, if there be fifteen days between the issuance and return

tion may be directed to the sheriff or other proper officer of any county, who shall
serve and execute the same, and make return thereof to the court in which the

A sale of land made under an execution after its return-day does not pass title. Lehr v. Rodgers, 3
Smed. & M., 468; Williamson v. Williamson, 52 Miss., 725.
776

PROCESS.

3461-3467

If an execution, issued more than fifteen days before a terra, be made returnable to a later term, it will
be void. Lehr v. Rodgers, 3 Smed. & M., 468.
An execution issued within five days of a term, and made returnable thereto, is void. Harris v. West,
25 Miss., 156.
An execution 'issued seventeen days before the return-term, and received by the sheriff ten days after
issuance, is not void. Skinner v. Wilson, 61 Miss., 90.
3461 (1774). Several executions; death of one defendant.—If any party in
whose favor an execution has issued shall desire to take out another execution, the
clerk may issue the same at the cost of such party, if the first writ have not been
returned and have not been executed ; and when one judgment has been recovered
against several defendants, execution shall issue thereon against all the defendants,
and not otherwise; and if one or more of several defendants have died before the
issuance of the writ, and a revivor have not been had, the fact of the death shall
be noted on the writ, and the property of the survivors only shall, in such case, be
liable to the execution.
The failure to note the death of one will not vitiate the execution as to the other defendants. Wade v.
Watt, 41 Miss., 248.
The plaintiff may have execution against survivors, though it must issue against all by name, with sug
gestion of death noted on the writ. Bowen v. Bonner, 45 Miss., 10.
3462 (1449). Execution for costs of supreme court.—In cases decided in the
supreme court, or dismissed or otherwise disposed of, the clerk of the court may
issue executions for costs accrued in the supreme court, including the cost of the
transcript, and any other cost accrued on the appeal, in the same manner that the
clerks of the circuit courts are authorized to issue executions against any party
liable therefor; and such executions may be directed to the sheriff of any county,
and shall be returned in the same manner and under like penalties as in case of exe
cutions returnable to the circuit court.
3463. Executions and attachments; how levied.—Every writ of execution
or attachment shall be levied in the following manner, namely :
3464. First. When on land. —In case of a levy of an attachment on real estate
in the occupancy of any person, the officer shall go to the house or upon the land
of the defendant, and there declare that he attaches the same at the suit of the
plaintiff; but if the land be unoccupied, or if the process be an execution, he
may attach or lev}' upon the same by returning that he has attached or levied upon
the land, describing it by numbers or otherwise properl}', and, if the process be an
attachment, stating that the land is unoccupied; and in all cases the return of the
officer shall be conclusive of the facts stated therein, except on timely motion to
quash. (See § 2784 ; lis pendens.)
3465. Second. When on personalty.—If the levy be upon personal property,
the officer shall take the same into his possession and dispose of it according to law.
3466. Third. When on choses in action.—In case an attachment be levied-on
rights, credits, and choses in action, the officer shall take into his possession the
books of accounts and other evidences of debt belonging to the defendant, and he
shall summon, if the plaintiff so direct, all persons appearing to be indebted to the
defendant, or to have effects of his in their hands, as garnishees, in the manner pre
scribed by law.
3467. Fourth. When on corporate stock.—In case of the levy of an execution
or attachment on the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant in any corporation
777

PROCESS.
or joint-stock company, the officer shall go to the office or principal place of busi
ness of the corporation or company, and there declare that he attaches or levies
upon the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant therein at the suit of the plaint
iff; and he shall demand of any officer, agent, or clerk of such corporation or
company there present, and who is not the defendant, a statement in writing, under
oath, of the amount of the defendant's stock, the number of his shares, or extent
of his interest in such corporation or company, and shall leave with the officer,
agent, or clerk, a copy of the writ; but if no such officer, agent, or clerk be present,,
he shall post conspicuously at such office or place of business a copy of the writ,,
with a statement therewith that he has attached or levied upon the stock, shares,
or interest of the defendant at the suit of the plaintiff, and that he demands of the
corporation or company the statement, under oath, of the defendant's stock, share,
or interest therein. The stock, shares, and interest of the defendant in the corpo
ration or company, including all dividends that may accrue after such levy, shall be
bound by the lien of the execution or attachment. The corporation or company
shall, within a reasonable time, not longer than ten days after the levy, deliver to
the officer a statement in writing, under oath, of the particulars demanded by the
officer, and of the value of the defendant's stock, shares, or interest; and in case
the corporation or company shall neglect or refuse to do so, or shall willfully make
any false statement thereof, such corporation or company shall be liable to the
plaintiff for the full amount of the judgment or decree, or of such judgment as the
plaintiff shall recover if the process be an attachment; but the failure of the cor
poration or company to make such statement shall not affect the right of the officer
to sell the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant.
3468. Fifth. When on interest of a partner.—In case of the levy on the inter
est of a partner in the property or choses in action of any copartnership, the officer
shall, in the presence of one of the partners, or of some clerk or other employe of
theirs, declare that he makes such levy, take possession of the entire property, and
deal with the same according to law, and leave a copy of the writ with such part
ner, clerk, or employe. Whereupon, if the process be an attachment, the partners,,
or either of them, may replevy the property by giving bond, payable to the plaint
iff, in an amount to be fixed by the officer, equal to the plaintiff's demand, with
interest and probable costs, conditioned to pay whatever judgment the plaintiff may
recover of the defendant in the suit; or, if the process be an execution, conditioned
to pay to the plaintiff the full amount of the judgment or decree on which the
execution is issued, on or before the first day of the next term of the court from
which it issued. The bond shall be returned with the writ, and judgment may be
rendered against the obligors therein, as in case of other like replevy-bonds; or
one or more of the partners, or any creditor of the copartnership, may file a bill in
equity to wind up the partnership and settle the same and dissolve it, praying for a
receiver, and making the plaintiff a party thereto, but distribution shall not be
made to the plaintiff in an attachment until he shall establish his claim against the
defendant. If neither such bond be given nor such bill in equity be filed within
ten days after the levy, the property and choses in action attached or levied upon
shall be treated as the separate property of the defendant, and shall be bound for
the plaintiff's demand to the same extent as if it were really his separate property.
778

PROCESS.

3469-3473

3469. Sixth. When on interest of co-owners who are not partners.—When
the levy is on the undivided interest of the defendant in personal property other
than that of a partnership, the officer shall take the property into his possession,
and, if the process be an execution, he shall sell the property and account to the
plaintiff for the proceeds of the defendant's interest therein, and pay over to the
co-owner the proceeds of his interest; but, if the process be an attachment, he shall
safely keep the property, or the proceeds if a sale be proper, to abide the judgment
of the court, unless it be replevied by the defendant or his co-owner, who shall have
the right so to do. Judgment may be rendered against the obligors in any such
replevy-bond, in favor of the plaintiff in attachment, according to the rights of the
several co-owners.
A judgment-debtor can. be garnished. Gray v. Henby, 1 Smed. & M., 598; O'Brien v. Ledell, 10 Smcd.

subject to garnishment. Burleson v. Milan, 56 Miss., 399.
A service or levy of an attachment by an interested party is void. Dyson v. Baker, 54 Miss., 24.
The directions of the statute as to the manner of levying an attachment must be complied with. Tucker
v. Byars, 46 Miss., 549.
The officer is not required to summon as garnishees all persons shown by the books of account to be
indebted to defendant, but only such as may be alleged so to be. Boone v. Mcintosh, 62 Miss., 744.
A suggestion in the writ that a certain persou is indebted to the defendant makes it the duty of the officer
to summon that persou as garnishee, even though the writ contain no direct command that he do so. Sims v.
Patterson, 65 Miss., 6.
It is essential to the validity of the levy of an attachment on personalty that the officer take the posses
sion of the same. Gates v. Flint, 39 Miss., 365.
It is not necessary to the validity of the return that it should state that the property belonged to the
defendant. That fact will be intended. Saunders v. Columbus, 43 Miss., 583.
If the return show a substantial compliance with the Btatute, the levy will be valid. The return need not
follow the exact language used in the statute. Saunders v. Columbus, 43 Miss., 583.
3470 (1765). Money and choses in action levied on.—Money, bank-notes,
bills, evidences of debt circulating as money, and any judgment or decree belonging
to the defendant, may be taken under an execution or attachment and sold or dis
posed of according to law, or applied to the payment of the execution or in satis

3471 (1765). Purchaser's title to choses in action, etc.—The purchaser of
any chose in action, stock, share, interest, judgment, or decree of the defendant,

and satisfied ; and it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer, on receipt of
an execution, to indorse thereon the day of the month and the year and the hour
when he received the same; and for a failure to make such indorsement, the sheriff
or other officer shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars, to the use of the
plaintiff, recoverable by motion before the court from which the execution issued,
and shall, moreover, be liable for all damages sustained by any party aggrieved.

PROCESS.

3474 (1746). Officer to care for property, and allowed expenses. —When a
sheriff' or other officer shall levy an execution on live-stock, he shall provide for its
sustenance until sold or otherwise legally discharged from the execution ; and upon
the return of the execution, the court, in cases where the compensation is not fixed
by law, shall settle and adjust what the officer shall be allowed for his expenses
incurred by providing for the stock, and also reasonable expenses of keeping per

of the death of the plaintiff*, and that the execution is at the instance of his execu
tor or administrator, stating the name of the executor or administrator; and when
an administrator, guardian, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary or official
capacity, who recovered a judgment, shall die, resign, or be removed without hav
ing obtained satisfaction thereof, his successor may have execution of the judgment
in the same manner, without revival of the judgment by scire facias.
The section does not apply in favor of a foreign administrator who has not complied with the statutory
requirements authorizing such administrator to act in this state. Jackson v. Scanland, 65 Miss , 481.
3476 (1748). Execution in favor of survivor of plaintiffs.—The death of one
or more of several plaintiffs in a judgment shall not prevent the issuance of execu
tion in favor of the survivors.
3477 (1749). Assignee of a judgment may have execution.—The assignee of
a judgment, where the plaintiff has died, may have execution thereof for his use as
if such death had not occurred, upon filing with the clerk his affidavit of the death
of the plaintiff and the assignment of the judgment; and, where the plaintiff has
not died, the assignee of a judgment may have an execution for his use in the same
manner.
3478 (1750). Death of party after execution issued.—The death of any plaint
iff or defendant after the issuance or the levy of an execution on personal or real
estate, shall not affect the duty of the officer making the levy to proceed and sell
as if such death had not occurred.
3479 (2751). Execution issued against dead defendant.—After one year from
the death of any defendant in a judgment for money, execution thereof maybe had
by leave of the court renderingthe judgment, or of the judge thereof in vacation, upon
cause shown, against any property upon which such judgment was a lien at the
time of the death of the defendant; and a sale of such property may be made in
the same manner and with the same effect as if the defendant were living; and, in
case of the death of the defendant in a judgment for the recovery of real or per
sonal property, execution may be had without revival, in the same manner as if the
defendant had not died.
Execution under the statute must be obtained from the court, or from the judge in vacation on cause
shown, on motion ot petition; and formal notice or process is not required. The "cause shown" relates
only to the judge in vacation. Alsop v. Cowan, 66 Miss., 451.
The petition is insufficient if it fail to show that the judgment was a lien at the time of defendant's death,
and a demurrer thereto should be sustained. Alsop v. Cowan, (it! Miss., 451.

3480-3484

3480 (1752). Scire facias may be resorted to.—The provisions for the execu
tion of judgments without revival shall not prevent a revival in any case by scire
facias.
•
3481 (1738). Execution and garnishment on certain judgments of other
courts issued by clerk (Laws 1890, p. 66).—The clerk of the circuit court in whose
office any judgment shall be enrolled, may issue execution and writs of garnishment
thereon, directed to any lawful officer of his county, returnable before the court
which rendered the judgment.
3482 (1754). Bond of indemnity; when required.—If any officer shall levy an
execution, attachment, or writ of seizure for the purchase-money on any personal
property, and a doubt shall arise whether the right to the property be in the defend
ant or not, such officer may demand of the plaintiff a bond, with sufficient sureties^
payable to the officer, in a penalty equal to double the value of the property, con
ditioned that the obligors therein will indemnify and save harmless the officer
against all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of
the property, and will pay to and satisfy any person claiming title to the property all
damages which such person ma}' sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale; and if
such bond be not given on or before the day of the sale or the return-day of the attach
ment, the officer shall be justified in releasing the levy and delivering the property
to the party from whose possession it was taken; but the plaintiff, or his agent or
attorney, shall have reasonable notice, in writing, before the day of sale or returnday of the writ, that the bond is required.
The statute only provides for an indemnifying-bond after levy, though a bond taken before levy is a good
common law obligation. (Now probably good under ? 946 as a statutory bond.) Forniquet v. Tegarden, 24
Miss., 96.
The obligors in the bond are only liable for such damages as the sheriff would be liable for had bond not
been taken. Moore v. Allen, 25 Miss., 363.
Whatever would have been a defense to the sheriff, if bond had not been taken, will be a defense to a suit
on the bond. Moore v. Allen, 25 Miss., 363.
The section does not apply to an attachment for rent. Gibson v. Lock, 58 Miss., 298.
The obligors in an indemnifying-bond are bound to pay such damages as results from the seizure, and not
attorney's fees or other expenses incurred in defending the title to the property. Brinker v. Leinkauff, 64
Miss., 236.
The sureties on an indemnifying-bond are not liable for damages resulting from the negligent failure of
the officer to safely keep the property. Smokey v. Peters, 66 Miss., 471.
The statute does not confer a right of action on the bond upon one who could not at common law have
maintained an action against the officer. Moore v. Allen, 25 Miss., 363; Marshall v. Stewart, 67 Miss., 494.
3483 (1755). Remedy on bond of indemnity.—If the bond and security be
given, it shall be returned with the writ, and the person claiming the property
levied on may prosecute a suit upon the bond, in the name of the payee or his rep
resentatives, for the use of the claimant, and recover such damages as he may sus
tain by the seizure or sale of the property or levy of process; and the claimant
shall, after the due execution of the bond, be barred of any action against the offi
cer levying the process, unless the obligors in the bond shall be or become insolv
ent, or the bond be otherwise invalid.
3484 (1757). Sales under execution; where made. —All sales by any sheriff
by virtue of an execution or other process, when not issued by a justice of the
peace, shall be made at the court-house of the county ; but personal property too

any convenient place; and cattle, sheep, or stock, other than horses and mules,
may he sold at any public place in the neighborhood of the defendant's residence.
3485 (2208). The same; where made under execution from justice's court. —
Sales of personal property under execution or other process from a justice of the
peace may be made at any convenient point in the district where it is found, or at
the court-house of the county; but the sale of lands under executions or other
process from such courts shall be made as under execution from the circuit courts.
3486 (1759). Sales of land; how and when made.—Sales of land may be
made on the first Monday of every month, or on the first Monday or Tuesday of a
term of the circuit court of the county, and shall be advertised in a newspaper
published in the county, once in each week for three successive weeks. (See § 3295.)
3487 (1759). Sales of personalty ; how and when made. —Sales of personalty
may be made on any day except Sunday, and shall be advertised ten days before
the day of sale by posting notices of the time, terms, and place of sale in three
public places in the county, one of which shall be at the court-house.
3488 (1758). Sale of perishable goods.—But when goods and chattels are levied
on, which in their nature are perishable and in danger of immediate waste or
decay, the officer levying shall sell them at such time, and on such notice, and at
such place as a sound discretion may warrant.
Railroad cross-ties, though liable to be burned, are not " in danger of immediate waste or decay." Good
man v. Moss, 64 Miss., 303.
3489 (1759). Hours, and how sale made.—Sales under execution shall not
commence sooner than eleven o'clock in the forenoon, nor continue later than four
o'clock in the afternoon; and all such sales shall be by auction, to the highest bid
der for cash, and only so much of the property levied on shall be sold as will satisfy
the execution and costs.
3490 (1760). Sale adjourned or continued from day to day.—Whenever, from
a defect of bidders, caused by inclement weather or otherwise, the property shall
not be likely to command a reasonable price, the officer may adjourn the sale and
re-advertise the same for a subsequent day ; and whenever a sale advertised for a
particular day shall not be completed on that day, the same may be continued from
day to day.
349L. Lands to be sold in one hundred and sixty acre tracts. —All lands com
prising a single tract, sold under execution, shall he first offered in subdivisions not
exceeding one hundred and sixty acres, or one-quarter section, and then offered as
an entirety, and the price bid for the latter shall control only when it shall exceed
the aggregate of the bids for the same in subdivisions.
3492 (1761). Venditioni exponas. —If any property taken in execution shall
remain in the hands of the officer unsold, he shall so return on the execution, and
thereupon a writ of venditioni exponas shall issue, directed to the officer, upon
which the like proceedings shall be had as might and ought to have been had on
the first execution. And if property sold on a venditioni exponas shall not bring
enough to satisfy the judgment, the officer shall forthwith return the same, and
thereupon another proper execution for the balance remaining unpaid may be issued.
3493 (1771). Venditioni exponas when officer taking property dies.—
When the officer taking property under execution shall die before the sale thereof,
782

PROCESS.

3494-3496

a writ of venditioni exponas shall issue, directed to the proper officer of the county
in which the property was taken, and such officer shall, under the writ of venditioni
exponas, receive the property from the representatives of the former sheriff, or
other officer, who are required to deliver the same to the- officer having the vendi
tioni exponas, on his producing the same and executing a receipt for the property,
and the officer shall proceed to sell the same as in other cases.
3494 (1772). Property seized if not delivered by representatives.—If the
representatives of the deceased officer shall refuse or neglect to deliver the property
011 demand, or if there shall not be an executor or administrator of his estate, the
officer having the writ of venditioni exponas may seize the property taken by the
former officer wherever it may be found, and sell the same as in other cases ; or the
plaintiff may move in the court from which the execution issued against the repre
sentatives of the deceased officer and his sureties, and thereupon a judgment shall
be entered against the representatives of the deceased officer and his sureties for
the amount of the execution whicli came to the hands of such deceased officer,
with interest and costs.
3495 (1762). Duty of officer to examine judgment-roll, etc.—After the
sale of any property by the sheriff or other officer on execution, before the money
is paid over by him, he shall examine the judgment-roll to ascertain if there be
any elder judgment or judgments, decree or decrees, enrolled against the defendant
or defendants in execution, having a priority of lien ; and if there be, he shall apply
the proceeds of the sale to the judgment or decree having the priority of lien, and
return such application upon the execution. But should there be any dispute as
to which judgment or decree lias the priority of lien, the officer shall make a state
ment of the fact of the dispute, and return the same, with the execution and the
mone}' raised thereon, into the court to which the same is returnable, and the court
shall, on motion and examination of the facts, determine to whom the money so
raised on execution shall be paid. (See § 2712.)
Where, on motion of the sheriff in the court below to appropriate money made on several executions, that
court awards the sum to a particular one, from which only one of the excluded parties appeals, the supreme
court, in reversing the judgment, will order the money to be paid to that creditor entitled to it, without regard
to his not having made objection to the decision below. Ileizer v. Fisher, 13 Smed. & M., 672.
The money should be appropriated to the oldest lien, whether the judgment having the prior lien be ren
dered in a state or a United States court, Bonaffee v. Fisk, 13 Smed. & M., 68-.
The lien created by the -levy of an execution can only be defeated by a lien existing anterior to the levy;
hence the enrollment of a judgment after the levy of an execution does not create a superior lien to that cre
ated by the levy. Botters v. Edrington, 30 Miss., 580.
The statute has no application to voluntary payments made by the defendant to the sheriff. Mississippi
R. R Co. v. Harkness, 32 Miss., 203; Johnson v. Edde, 58 Miss., 664.
When two judgments against different defendants are liens upon the same property, and it is sold under
the judgment with the junior lien, the senior judgment-lien is unimpaired by the sale, and the purchaser takes
subject to the maxim, "caveat emptor." Hall v. Meridian, 56 Miss., 674.
Where judgments are recovered by different holders of several promissory notes given for land, and
secured by express lien, each judgment is in equity entitled to share in the proceeds of the land, without ref
erence to the time of their enrollment, the debtor being insolvent. Aaron v. Warner, 62 Miss., 370.
3496 (1766). Officer to restore money on injunction of execution.—When an
officer shall receive under execution the whole or any part of the money for which
the same was issued, and the defendant, before payment thereof to the plaintiff,
obtain an injunction against the execution, the officer shall pay over to the defend
ant the money received, or such part thereof as may be enjoined; and if an officer
.shall, when required, fail to pay over the money so received and enjoined to the

PROCESS.

person having a right to demand the same, such officer and his sureties shall be
liable to the same remedies as are given by law to the plaintiff for the non-payment
of money levied on execution. (See § 4120.)
3497 (1763). How purchaser takes property at execution-sale. —The pur
chaser of any property sold at execution-sale by the sheriff or other officer shall
take the same discharged of all liens of judgments and decrees, whether the same
be sold under an execution issued upon the elder or junior judgment or decree.
The statute only applies where tlie judgments are against the same person. Hall v. Meridian, 56 Miss.,
674.
3498 (1769). Conveyance of land sold under execution.—When lauds are sold
by virtue of any writ of execution or other process, the officer making the sale shall,
on payment of the purchase-money, execute to the purchaser a conveyance which
shall vest in the purchaser all the right, title, and interest which the defendant had
in and to such lands, and which, by law, could be sold under such execution or
other process. (See, for case of failure, § 2442.)
3499 (2211). What necessary to complete title under justice's execution.—
The title to land sold under execution issued by a justice of the peace shall not be
complete in the purchaser until he shall have obtained from the justice a certified
transcript of the proceedings had before him in the suit, including a copy of the
execution and the officer's return on it, which shall be filed with the conveyance
made by the officer in the chancery clerk's office and recorded with the conveyance;
and, upon filing such transcript and conveyance for record in the chancery clerk's
office of the county where the land lies, the title of the purchaser shall be as full
and complete as if the sale had been under a judgment and execution from a circuit
court.
The "certified transcript" must include the docket entries; and, if these be correctly kept, need include
nothing else. Hughston v. Cornish, 59 Miss., 372.
3500. Process executed by an officer out of his county.—The sheriff or other
proper officer of a county may execute process out of his county, in case the person
to be served or property to be seized was in the officer's county when the writ was
received, but had removed or been carried into another county before its execution.
In such case the officer shall state the facts in his return, and the writ and return
shall have the same effect as if the process had been returned not executed and a
testatum or duplicate writ had been issued to and executed and returned by an
officer of the county where served.
3501. Provisions of chapter applicable to all courts.—The law of process as
declared in this chapter, except where its provisions are restricted to particular
tribunals in terms or by the nature of the subject-matter, shall govern in all courts.
For process in landlord and tenant matters, see §§ 2504, 2507, 2508, 2520,
2.349, 2550.

in the chapter entitled " Principal and Surety." (See § 3279.)
The party in such case becomes subrogated to the lien and rights of the plaintiff, and is entitled to exe
cution in his favor against the other defendant. And such right extends to an indoiser of a draft on which
judgment is rendered against him and the principal debtor. {Explaining Dibrell v. Dandridge, 51 Miss., 55.)

by the laws of this state, to do business in this state forfeited because of its per
sistent refusal to comply with the laws thereof.
Tenth.—Whenever any non-resident alien or corporation shall acquire or hold
lands contrary to law.
Where a charter is repealed, and the performance of its functions is made criminal, it is no objection to
a prosecution that the franchise was not forfeited by a quo warranto proceeding. Moore v. State, 48 Miss., 147.
Where an officer fails to qualify under newly-imposed conditions, quo warranto is an appropriate remedy
to remove him. Hyde v. State, 52 Miss., 665.
3521 (2585, 2587). Proceedings; how and where.—The proceedings in such
cases shall be by information, in the name of the state, by the attorney-general or a
district attorney, on his own motion or on relation of another, and, in a case to try

or, in the case of an officer, where he acts as such ; or, in case of a corporation or
pretended corporation, where its principal office or place of business ma\r be or
where it may transact any business and has an agent; or, in case of an alien or
corporation acquiring or holding land contrary to law, where any of the land is

3522 (2587). Trial of right to office, etc.—In case the proceedings be on the
relation of a person claiming 'to be entitled to an office, the ground of his claim
shall be stated by proper averment, and judgment shall be rendered according to

such case, shall have all the powers of a circuit court, and he shall be attended by
the clerk of the circuit court, and by the sheriff; and the judge may order a jury
to be drawn, summoned, and impaneled to try the case, as a circuit court might,
and may try and dispose of the case as if presiding in a circuit court; and the judg
ment shall have the same effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, and may
be appealed from, as if rendered by a circuit court.
It is discretionary with the judge to try in vacation or not. Bowen v. Gilleylen, 58 Miss., 813.

CHAPTER 114.
REPLEVIN.
3707 (2613). How replevin commenced. —If any person, his agent or attorney,
shall make an affidavit, setting forth—
(a) A description of any personal property ;
(6) The value thereof, giving the value of* each separate article ;
(c) That he js entitled to the immediate possession thereof ;
(d) That the same is in the possession of the defendant ; and
(e) That the defendant wrongfully took and detains, or wrongfully detains the
same ;
And shall present the affidavit to a judge of the supreme court, a judge of a
circuit court, or a chancellor, or to a clerk of a circuit or chancery court, or to the
deputy of such clerk, or to any justice of the peace, or to the mayor of any city,
town, or village, it shall be the duty of the officer to issue a writ of replevin for such
personal property, returnable, as a summons, before the proper circuit court when
the value exceeds two hundred dollars, or to the court of the proper justice of the
peace if the value shall not exceed that sum ; and the affidavit shall be returned
to and filed in the proper court at once. And the above-mentioned officers of one
county may issue a writ of replevin returnable to the proper court of another
county where the property may be found. (See § 2416.) .
It is indispensable, under the statute as well as at common law, that the plaintiff must have the right to
821

3708-371 I

REPLEVIN.

lie immediate possession. Lloyd v. Goodwin, 12 Smed. &, M., 223; Frizell v. White, 27 Miss., 198; Buck v.
Payne, 52 Miss., 271.
The affidavit in replevin is a part of the record; the declaration must correspond with it Newell v.
Newell, 34 Miss., 335.
Where defendant in replevin sets up title in himself, it is unnecessary for plaintiff to make demand for
the property before suing. Dearing v. Ford, 13 Smed. & M., 269; Newell v. Newell, 34 Miss., 385.
To defeat a replevin for timber cut on the land of the plaintiff who is not in possession of the land, an
actual adverse possession in another must be shown. Phillips v. Gastrell, 61 Miss., 413.
An action of replevin will lie only against the party in possession of the property at the time the action
is instituted. McCormick v. McCormick, 40 Miss., 760; Griffin v. Lancaster, 59 Miss., 340.
The action does not lie as between joint owners. Holton v. Binns, 40 Miss., 491.
Replevin may be brought in the name of one for the use of another. In such case, however, only the
rights of the (nominal) plaintiff are considered. Pearce v. Twichell, 41 Miss., 344; Meyer v. Mosler, 64 Miss.,
610.
The owner may recover his property in replevin whenever it can be identified, unaffected by any change
in shape or form. Heard v. James, 49 Miss., 236.
Replevin lies for an unindorsed county warrant. The difficulty in taking the chose in action does not
affect the right to the remedy. Saunders v. Jordan, 54 Miss., 428.
Replevin lies against a garnishee by one claiming to be the owner of the property, notwithstanding the
garnishment. He must compel interpleader. Morin v. Bailey, 55 Miss., 570.
Replevin cannot be maintained for property which the defendant received in exchange for the plaintiff's
property. Power v. Telford, 60 Miss., 195,
The action is maintainable against a tax-collector for goods wrongfully seized. Miller v. McGehee, 60
Miss. 903.
The defendant cannot defeat the plaintiff's right by asserting a lien on the property in favor of a stranger.
McGill v. Howard, 61 Miss., 411.
If a special execution, issued on a judgment in replevin, be about to be levied on property to which one
not a party to the suit makes claim, he may bring replevin for it. Andrews v. McLeod, 66 Miss., 348.
One partner cannot maintain the action for partnership property wrongfully sold to another person by a
copartner in payment of an individual debt. Hoff v. Rogers, 67 Miss., 208.
3708 (2635). Form of affidavit.—The affidavit in replevin may be to the follow
ing effect, viz. :
"State of County.
Mississippi, }(
" Before me,
, a justice of the peace of said county,
makes affidavit
that [here describe the property and give value of each article], the property of
affiant, is wrongfully detained by
, in district No. —, for the election of jus
tices of the peace in said county, and that this affiant is legally entitled to the imme
diate possession thereof; wherefore he prays a writ of replevin for the seizure of
said property.
.
" Sworn to and subscribed before me, the
day of
, A.D.
.
"
, J. P"
3709 (2634). Venue.—The action of replevin may be instituted in the circuit
court of a county, or the justice's court of a district, in which the defendant, or one
of several, or the property, or some of it, may be found, and all proper process may
be issued to other counties or districts, as the case may be.
3710 (2614). The writ. —The writ of replevin shall command the sheriff, or
other lawful officer, to take the property specified in the affidavit, and deal with
it according to lawT; and to summon the defendant to appear in court on the
return-day of the writ to answer to the action.
3711 (2636). Form of the writ. —The writ of replevin may be to the following
effect, viz.:
822

REPLEVIN.
3712-3716
•
"The State op Mississippi.
" To any lawful officer of
county :
"We command you to take [here describe the property as in the affidavit],
alleged by
, the plaintiff', to be wrongfully detained by
, the defendant,
and to deal therewith according to law; and to summon the said defendant to
appear before
, a justice of the peace of said county, in district No. —, at
, at — o'clock —m., on
the
day of
, A.D.
, to answer
, the plaintiff, for the unlawful detention of said property.
" Witness my hand, the
day of
, A.D.
.
, J. P."
3712 (2615). How and when writ may be executed.—The writ may be exe
cuted by seizing the property and summoning the defendant as in other actions at
any time before the first day of the court to which it is returnable.
3713 (2639). Form of return of officer.—The officer's return on such writ may
be in the following form, viz. :
"Executed the within writ, by taking possession of [here describe the property,
giving the value of each article separately] found in the possession of
, and
by summoning the defendant [naming him] according to the command of said writ,
and I have delivered him a true copy of the writ [or otherwise as the case may be].
The said
having entered into bond, with
and
as his sureties,
for the sum of
dollars, conditioned according to law, I delivered said prop
erty to him, and now return said bond and writ.
, Sheriff."
If the defendant fail to give bond, and plaintiff* give a bond and receive the
property, or if neither give the required bond, and the property remain in the
hands of the officer, his return should be varied accordingly.
3714 (2622). Officer's valuation prima facie evidence.—The valuation of prop
erty by the officer in his return shall in all cases be prima facie evidence of the
value of the property.
3715 (2616). Property restored to defendant on bond.—If the defendant shall,
within two days from the seizure of the property, or at any time afterwards, and
while it is in the possession of the officer, enter into bond with sufficient sureties,
to be approved by the officer, payable to the plaintiff", in double the value of the
property, conditioned that it shall be forthcoming to satisfy the judgment of the
court, the property shall be restored to him.
The sureties on a defendant's bond are liable for costs; and a surrender of the property does not acquit
them thereof. Phillips v. Cooper, 59 Miss., 17.
Where plaintiff on the trial dismissed his suit as to one of two defendants who had joined as principals
in the bond, judgment could not rightfully be rendered against the sureties. Tyler v. Davis, 63 Miss., 345.
3716. Form of bond by defendant.—The bond to be given by a defendant in
replevin may be in the following form, viz. :
" State of County.
Mississippi, j\
" Be it known, that we,
, principal, and
and
, sureties, agree
and bind ourselves to pay
, the plaintiff, the sum of
dollars, unless
the said principal obligor and defendant shall have certain personal property, to
wit : [here describe the property specifically and fully, giving the value of each
item or article separately] before the
court of

3717 (2617). Plaintiff may give bond and receive property.—If the defendant
shall not give bond within two days from the seizure of the property, the sheriff or
other officer shall deliver the same to the plaintiff, upon the plaintiff entering into
bond to the defendant, with sufficient sureties, in double the value of the property,
to be ascertained by the valuation of the officer, conditioned that he will prosecute
the writ to effect, and without delay make return of the property to the defend
ant, if return thereof be adjudged, and pay the defendant such damages as he may
sustain by the wrongful suing out of the writ, and also such costs as may be
awarded against him, and save harmless the officer for replevying the property; but
if neither party give bond, the property shall remain in the hands of the officer,
subject to the right of either party before the trial to give bond and receive the
property.
3718. Plaintiff in certain cases has first right to bond. —But if the plaintiff
aver in the affidavit that the property was wrongfully taken from his actual posses
sion within thirty days, that fact shall be recited in the writ, and in such case the
plaintiff shall have the right for the two days in preference to the defendant to give
the replevin-bond and regain possession of the property.
3719 (2638). Form of plaintiff's replevin-bond.—The plaintiff's bond in
replevin may be in the usual form, with a condition to the following effect, viz.:
" Unless the said
, the principal and plaintiff, shall prosecute to effect his
writ of replevin against
, the defendant, for certain property [here describe
the property and give the value of each article separately], and now delivered to
the said plaintiff upon the execution of this bond; and shall, without delay, return
said property to the said
, the defendant, if return thereof be adjudged, and
shall pay to the said
such damages as he may sustain by the wrongful suing
out of the said writ, and such costs as may be awarded against him, and save harm
less the officer who replevied said property.

3720 (2626). Bond returned, and may be excepted to.—The bond directed to
be taken in either case shall be returned with the writ to the court issuing the same ;
and if the sheriff or other officer fail to take a proper and sufficient bond and return
824

REPLEVIN.

3721-3725

the same, or if the bond taken be adjudged insufficient, and the party giving it
shall, if required, fail to perfect the same, the sheriff or other officer shall be liable
to the party injured for all damages by him sustained; but the parties shall have
the same right of amendment as in cases of attachment. (See § 132.)
3721 (2627). New bond may be required.—If either party in the suit, or the
sheriff or other officer, shall at any time deem any bond taken insufficient, such
party or officer, if in vacation, may, upon application to the judge of the court
where the suit may be pending, obtain a citation, under the signature of the judge,
commanding the principal obligor in the bond to appear before the judge at such
time and place as he may designate; and, if in term-time, the party or officer may
proceed by motion; and, in either case, the judge or court shall, after hearing the
evidence of both parties, determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of the bond. And
if the bond given by the plaintiff be adjudged insufficient, he shall give a new and
sufficient bond, or restore the property to the officer within the time limited by the
court or judge; and in default thereof, the defendant shall be entitled to proceed
and enter judgment as in case the plaintiff should be nonsuited or otherwise make
default. And if the bond of the defendant be adjudged insufficient, and he fail to
give a sufficient bond within the time limited by the court or judge, the plaintiff,
on giving bond as directed, shall be entitled to a writ commanding the officer to
take the property in controversy and deliver the same to the plaintiff; and there
upon such proceedings shall be had as if the property had been delivered to the
plaintiff in the first instance. (See § 948.)
3722 (2618). Property to be sold, when.—When horses, mules, or other live
stock, or any chattels which are expensive to keep, or perishable articles, shall be
taken under a writ of replevin, for which neither party shall give bond in the mean
time, they shall be sold as provided in reference to such property when seized under
attachment ; and the proceeds of the sale, after payment of proper expenses,
shall be in lieu of the things sold. (See § 160.)
3723 (2619). When property not taken, plaintiff may elect to recover dam
ages.—If the return of the officer on the writ show a failure to take the goods and
chattels, but that the defendant has been summoned, the plaintiff may declare
and prosecute the action for the recovery of the value of property, and damages
for the taking or detention of the property, as if he had thus commenced his action.
The statute does not apply in every instance where the property is not found. It applies only where the
froperty was in defendant s possession at the beginning of the suit, and the action remains one of replevin,
t does apply to a failure to find a part of the property. Krosmopolski v. Paxton, 58 Miss., 581.
The return of the officer on the writ must show affirmatively a failure to take the property, or a part of
it, or the statute will not be applicable. Meyer v. Mosler. 64 Miss., 610.
3724 (2620). Duplicate, alias, and pluries writs, and publication.—The plaint
iff shall be entitled to duplicate writs to other counties, and alias and pluries writs to
take the property or to summon the defendant, as in other actions; and when the
property shall be taken under the writ, but the defendant cannot be found, the
defendant shall be notified by publication, as provided in case of attachment under
like circumstances. (See §§ 143, 144, 145, 146.)
v
3725 (2621). The pleadings. —The declaration may be filed after the issuance
of the writ, if it be filed on or before the first day of the return-term, or before any
order of dismissal be taken; and the action may be tried at the first term of the
825

3726-3728

REPLEVIN.

court. The defendant may plead that he is not guilty of the premises charged
against him, and this plea shall put in issue not only the right of the plaintiff to
the possession of the property, but also the wrongful taking and detention, or
wrongful detention thereof, as the case may be.
A declaration for the recovery of the property, and for damages for the wrongful taking or detention is
divisable; hence a demurrer to the whole will be overruled, if the declaration be sufficient so far as it relates
to the recovery of the property, though defective as to the damages claimed. Newell v. Newell, 34 Miss., 385.
Where the affidavit sets out only a wrongful detention, it will be improper to allege in the declaration
both a wrongful taking and detention Newell v. Newell, 34 Miss., 385.
Under the plea of not guilty, the defendant may impeach the validity of a deed by showing his incapacity
to execute it. Odom v. Harris, 34 Miss., 410.
Not guilty is the only plea to the action. Any other plea may be stricken out on motion, or treated as a
nullity; but judgment final should not be entered on motion on account of false pleading. Bennett v. Holloway, 55 Miss., 211.
3726 (2622). Judgment for plaintiff.—If the plaintiff recover, and the defend
ant have given bond for the property, the judgment shall be against the defendant
and the sureties on his bond, that they restore the property to the plaintiff, if to be
had, or pay him the value thereof, or of his interest therein, if a limited one, as
assessed by the verdict of the jury, and that they pay to the plaintiff such damages
as shall have been assessed by the jury for the wrongful taking and detention, or
for the wrongful detention thereof ; but if the plaintiff have given boud for the
property, the judgment shall be that he retain it, aid that he recover of the defend
ant the damages assessed for the wrongful taking and detention, or wrongful deten
tion, as the case may be. If the plaintiff recover judgment by default, he may have
a writ of inquiry to assess the value of the property or the damages for the wrong
ful taking and detention, or wrongful detention, or both, as the case may be; and
judgment shall be rendered therein as upon an issue found for him.
3727 (2623). Judgment for defendant.—If the verdict be for the defendant,
and the plaintiff have given bond for the property, the judgment shall be against
the plaintiff and the sureties on his bond that they restore to the. defendant the
property, if to be had, or pay to him the value thereof and the damages for the
wrongful suing out of the writ as assessed; but if the defendant have given bond
for the property, the judgment shall be that he retain it, and that he recover of the
plaintiff the damages sustained by the wrongful suing out of the writ. In case the
plaintiff make default in prosecuting the suit, or be nonsuited, the defendant may
have a writ of inquiry to assess the value of the property or the damages sustained
by the wrongful suing out of the writ, or both, as the case may be ; and like judg
ment shall be rendered upon the finding as upon an issue found for him.
3728 (2623). Judgment where no bond is given.—If bond be not given, and
the property remain in the hands of the sheriff or other officer, the value of the
property and the damages sustained shall be assessed, and judgment shall be for
the recovery of the property, and the damages assessed against the party liable, and
the sheriff or other officer shall deliver the property to the successful party, and
execution shall issue for damages and costs of suit.
Where the successful party has a limited interest in the property, it is erroneous to assess, in his favor,
the full value of the property. The value of the interest therein should only be assessed. Lloyd v. Good
win, 12 Smed. & M , 223; Jones v. Hicks, 52 Miss., 682; Bates v. Snider, 59 Miss., 497.
Whatever are commonly understood to be parts of a whole may be assessed as one article; but where
articles are distinct, as "barouche and harness and horses," it would be erroneous to value them as a whole.
Drane v. Hilzheim, 13 Smed. & M., 336.
Where a verdict is rendered, but the jury failed to properly assess the value of the property, the verdict
'826

REPLEVIN.

3729-3731

should stand, and a writ of inquiry may be subsequently ordered to assess the value. Drane v. Hilzheim, 13
Smed. & M., 336 ; Spratley v. Kitchens, 55 Miss., 578.
A verdict for each article and assessing the value of each is correct; but the judgment must follow the
verdict, and if it state each article separately but only give the aggregate value, it is erroneous. Whitfield v.
Whitfield, 40 Miss., 352.
The measure of damages, in the absence of fraud, malice, oppression, or willful wrong, is the value of the
property with interest; but where fraud, etc., intervene, the measure of damages is a matter to be determined
from the evidence by the jury. Whitfield v. Whitfield, 40 Miss., 352; Heard v. Jones, 49 Miss., 236.
When consequential damages are claimed, which do not result necessarily and naturally from the tortious
act, they must be specially alleged. Burrage v. Melsor, 48 Miss., 237.
It is improper for the jury to allow an attorney's fee as damages where the proof fails to show willful
wrong, fraud, malice, or oppression. Cowden v. Loekridge, 60 Miss., 385; Taylor v. Morton, 61 Miss., 24.
3729 (2624). Execution.—If the party in whose favor the judgment is given
be in possession of the property in controversy, he shall retain it ; or if the property
be in possession of the officer, he shall deliver it to the successful party, and a writ
of fieri facias shall issue for the damages and cost of suit. And if the property be in
possession of the losing party, the execution shall command the sheriff to take the
property in controversy, if the same may be had, and deliver the same to the suc
cessful party, and, if not to be had, that he make the value thereof of the goods and
chattels, lands and tenements, of the party and his sureties against whom the judg
ment is rendered; and shall command that he so make the damages assessed and
costs of the suit ; or the successful party may have a distringas to compel the deliv
ery of the property, together with a fieri facias for the damages and costs.
One asserting ownership of property taken under special execution on a judgment in replevin, cannot
interpose a claim for it. His remedy is replevin. Andrews v. McLeod, 66 Miss., 348.
3730 (2628). Claim of property by third person.—If a third person, not a party
to the action of replevin, shall claim to be the owner or entitled to the possession
of goods or chattels taken under a writ of replevin, he shall not be allowed to insti
tute another action of replevin while the former is pending, but may make oath of
his claim, and file it with the officer taking the property, or, if he have delivered it
to either of the parties, with the clerk of the court or justice of the peace; and,
if possession of the property have not been taken by either of the parties, and four
days have elapsed since its seizure, it shall be delivered to the claimant, on his giving
bond in double the value of the property, to be fixed by the officer, with sufficient
sureties, to be approved by the officer, payable to him and conditioned to have the
property forthcoming to satisfy the judgment of the court. If the property have
been delivered to one of the parties to the action, his bond shall stand as security to
the claimant if the claim be maintained. The bond of the claimant shall stand as
security to the parties to the action, and judgment may be rendered on it according
to the exigency.
There must be an adjudication between the original parties; the issue is then to be made between the
successful party and the claimant; the latter becomes plaintiff in this contest. Ettringham v. Handy, 60.
Miss., 334.
The claim must be propounded before judgment in the suit; afterwards a new replevin can be brought
Andrews v. McLeod, 66 Miss., 348.
3731 (2629). Issue and trial and judgment.—After the trial of the action of
replevin, an issue shall be made up between the successful party and the claimant as
to the validity of his claim, and a trial shall be had ; and if the issue be found against
the claimant, and the property were delivered to him, judgment shall be given
against the obligors in his bond for the restoration of the property if to be had, or
827

3732-3737

REPORTER AND REPORTS.

its value, with such damages as may be assessed and costs. If the property were
not delivered to the claimant, and the issue be found against him, judgment shall be
given against him for such damages as may be assessed, and costs.
3732 (2630). Judgment in favor of claimant. —If the issue be found in favor
of the claimant, he shall have judgment for the property, and if a bond were given
by either party to the replevin suit, he shall recover on the bond, as if it had been
payable to him; and any judgment recovered in the trial of the action by the party
between whom and the claimant the issue may be, shall, in case of the determina
tion of such issue iu favor of the claimant, inure to his advantage, to the extent of
his rights, as if such judgment had been rendered in his favor.
3733 (2631). Claimant considered a plaintiff.—The claimant shall be consid
ered a plaintiff in the issue, and may be required to give security for costs as other
plaintiffs, and shall have the right of a party to the action in which his claim is
interposed to except to any bond given in the case.
3734 (2632). Laws applicable in case of death.—AH the provisions of law in
reference to the death of either party, and the revival of the cause in personal
actions, and the death of any of the obligors in a bond given in the progress of a
cause, and the proceedings thereon before and after judgment, shall apply in like
case to the action of replevin, and to a claim of property in such action. (See
§§ 666, 667, 668, 942.)
3735 (2633). Replevin not maintainable in certain cases.—The action of
replevin shall not be maintainable in any case of the seizure of property under exe
cution or attachment when a remedy is given to claim the property by making claim
to it in some mode prescribed by law, but the .person claiming must resort to the
specific mode prescribed in such case, and shall not resort to the action of replevin.
The statute is not applicable if the officer hold the property under process from the supreme court. State
v. Booker, 61 Miss., 16.
The statute does not prevent the bringing of replevin against the purchaser of property sold under exe
cution or attachment. Armistead v. Bernard, 62 Miss., 180.
The statute does not preclude any remedy except replevin, and this is precluded only while the property
is in the hands of the officer. Woolner v. Spaulding, 65 Miss., 204; Conn v. Bernheimer, 67 Miss., 498.
If the property be seized under a writ from a justice of the peace, replevin cannot be maintained for it,
even if the property exceed two hundred dollars in value. The justice in such case has jurisdiction of a
claimant's issue. Bernheimer v. Martin, 66 Miss , 486.

CHAPTER 115.
REPORTER AND REPORTS.
3736 (1454). The reporter. —The supreme court shall appoint a reporter of its
decisions, by an order entered on the minutes of the court, who shall hold his office
for the term of six years from the date of appointment, who shall discharge the
duties and receive the compensation provided by law, and be removable at the

Jackson, if there be one, for the period of three weeks. The supreme court shall
have power to alter the times fixed for taking up the dockets of the second and
third districts, and so to arrange the same as the public convenience may require.
4340 (1400). Adjournment, if judges are absent; special terms; discontin

a quorum of the judges shall not appear by the thirteenth day, the court may pro
ceed with its session; and if there should not be a clerk, or he shall not be in

4343-4345

SUPREME COUKT.

appeals and all process returnable before it in cases in such district, except in cases
in which an appeal is provided for at any time during the term of the court: and
all officers failing to make return of process or to pay over money which they
should pay over at that time, shall be liable for such failure, as in case of failure to
perform a like duty in the circuit court, and may be proceeded against in like man
ner in the supreme court. (For return-days in criminal cases, see § 71.)
The law fixes two return-days (in civil eases) of equal dignity. Appeals granted in open court from
decrees in chancery are returnable to the first return-day after appeal taken ; all other appeals (in civil cases),
except as provided in the next section, are returnable to the first return-day which is more than ten days after
the appeal is taken. Hospital v. Knox, 57 Miss., 600; Childs v. Rowell, 58 Miss., 512.
4343 (1403). Appeals in some cases returnable at any time, etc.—Appeals
from judgments against persons deprived of their liberty in cases of habeas corpus,
and from judgment on informations in the nature of quo warranto to try the right to
a public office, whether state, district, county, or municipal, and in actions of man
damus, in cases where the public interest is concerned, and in cases at law or in
chancery involving taxes claimed by the state, county, or municipality, may be
returnable before the supreme court immediately, without reference to the returndays for other appeals ; and when the transcript of the record of the case shall be
filed in the office of the clerk of the supreme court, the appellee having been sum
moned to appear and answer the appeal, ten days after service of the summons on
him or his attorney, the court shall consider such cases as entitled to be heard with
out regard to the district from which they are brought, and in preference to all
civil cases, and they shall be heard and disposed of with all convenient speed.
4344 (1404). Powers of the judges to grant appeals.—The judges of the
supreme court may severally grant appeals from interlocutory decrees in chancery,
when by such decree money is to be paid or the possession of property is to be
changed, or when the appeal is necessary to settle the principles' of the cause and
has been refused by the chancery court or by the chancellor in vacation. They
may allow an appeal, and, if necessary, a supersedeas from the final judgment of
any circuit court, or the final decree of a chancery court, or in any other case in
which an appeal is given, at any time within which an appeal may be allowed by
law.
The judges severally may grant appeals. Wilson v. Pugh, Gl Miss., 449.
4345 (1405, 1720). Jurisdiction of the court.—The supreme court shall have
such jurisdiction as properly belongs to a court of appeals, and shall hear and deter
mine all manner of pleas, plaints, motions, causes, and controversies, civil and
criminal, which are now pending therein, or which may be brought before it, and
which shall be cognizable in said court; but a cause shall not be removed into said
court until after final judgment in the court below, except in cases particularly pro
vided for by law ; and the supreme court may grant new trials and correct errors
of the circuit court in granting or refusing the same.
What properly belongs to a court of appeals depends on considerations of public policy, and is mainly to
be determined by the legislature. The legislature has the power to make a decision of a lower court final.
(Yalobusha Co. v. Carbey, 3 Smed. & M., 547, overruled.) Dismukes v. Stokes, 41 Miss., 430.
The jurisdiction of the court is only revisory. It cannot grant a writ of prohibition to the circuit courtIt may hear and determine all motions and issues necessary to the exercise of its appellate powers. Planters
v. Cramer, 47 Miss., 200; Brown v. Carraway, 47 Miss., 668.
The court has no jurisdiction of an appeal from an order granting a new trial until the case has been
finally decided. Wood v. Ins. Co., 7 How. (Miss.), 609; Bank v. Taylor, 2 Smed. & M., 27; Darr v. Watson,
28 Miss., 383; Terry v. Robbins, 5 Smed. & M., 291 ; Brown v. Carraway, 47 Miss , 668.

SUPREME COURT.

4346-4351

The supreme court has inherent power on reversing a judgment, where the facts appear of record, to
award a restitution to the party dispossessed under the judgment pending his appeal. Hall v. Wells, 54
Miss., 289, 306.
4346 (1406). May make all orders and issue process, etc.—The supreme
court may make all orders and cause to be issued and executed all process necessary
or proper to secure an appeal to it from any judgment or decree from which an
appeal may be taken to the supreme court, and to compel the production before it
of a full and perfect transcript pf the record and proceedings in any case in which
an appeal to said court is provided for by law, and of all papers necessary to the
disposition of any case or matter properly before it.
4347 (1407). Appeal not to fail for certain things.—An appeal to the supreme
court shall not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction because of a defect in the
application for appeal, or in the bond, or because of any failure by an officer to
comply with the requirements of law in reference to appeals; but all defects and
irregularities may be cured by amendment, so as to perfect the appeal and obtain
the judgment of the supreme court in the case; but the court may dismiss an ap
peal for a failure of the appellant to do, within a reasonable time, what may be
necessary to perfect his appeal.
Where the appellant failed to execute a bond, he may be permitted to supply the same, so as to perfect
the appeal. Hudson v. Gray, 58 Miss., 589.
A party will be permitted to amend in all cases so as to perfect his appeal. State v. Coahoma Co., 64
Miss., 358.
4348 (1408). May make rules and enforce them. —The supreme court shall
have power to make such rules in respect to making out records for said court, as
may be expedient, and may prescribe the form and manner in which records shall
be prepared for appeal, and cause the same to be bound, but shall not require any
record to be printed ; and may enforce its rules by proper fines or by refusal to
allow costs to be taxed to the clerks below on records not made out according to
the rules, or by refusing to permit such records to be filed. And the court may pre
scribe the mode of pleading in causes therein, civil and criminal, and the manner
of trying the same; and may also establish such rules of practice and proceedings
therein as may be deemed necessary and proper for certainty and dispatch of busi
ness, and may dismiss causes for non-compliance with any of the rules; but such
rules must be consistent with law.
4349 (1411). Allowance for books, etc.—The supreme court shall make allow
ance to the clerk for all needful sums for supplying the oflice with necessary
books, stationery, furniture, and presses for preserving the records and for the safe
keeping of the books and papers belonging to the office, and the allowance, being
certified to the auditor of public accounts by any of the judges, shall be paid out
of the appropriation for the judicial department.
4350 (1412). Issues of fact may be tried.—The supreme court may try and
determine all issues of fact which may arise out of any appeal before, it and be
necessary to the disposition thereof, and, to this end, may, by order in each case,
prescribe in what way evidence may be produced before it on the issue.
The supreme court has no jurisdiction to try a claimant's issue for property seized under execution from
it. The remedy is replevin. State v. Booker, 61 Miss., 16.
4351 (1413). The chief justice.—The judge of the supreme court who has been
for the longest time continuously a member of the court shall be chief justice ; and,
953

4352-4357

supreme court.

in case of his absence, the judge who has been for the next longest time continu
ously a member shall preside.
4352 (1413). What opinions to be in writing.—Iu all cases settling important
principles, in cases to be remanded, and in all cases where the judgment or decree
of the court below is reversed, the opinion of the supreme court shall be in writing,
stating the reasons upon which the decision is made; and the opinion shall be
recorded by the clerk in a well-bound book to be kept for that purpose.
4353 (1415). Cases heard at return-term; judgment.—The supreme court
shall hear and determine all cases properly brought before it at the return-term,
unless cause be shown for a continuance; and in case the judgment, sentence, or
decree of the court below be reversed, the supreme court shall render such judg
ment, sentence, or decree as the court below should have rendered, unless it be uecessary, in consequence of its decision, that some matter of fact be ascertained, or
damages be assessed by a jury, or where the matter to be determined is uncertain;
in either of which cases the suit, action, or prosecution shall be remanded for a
final decision ; and when so remanded, shall be proceeded with in the court below
according to the direction of the supreme court, or according to law in the absence
of such directions.
4354. Certain cases may be sent to the proper court.—A judgment or decree
in any chancery or circuit court rendered in a civil cause, shall not be reversed or
annulled on account of want of jurisdiction to render the judgment or decree from
any error or mistake as to whether the cause iu which it was rendered was of equity
or common law jurisdiction ; but if the supreme court shall find error in the pro
ceedings other than as to jurisdiction, and it shall be necessary to remand the case,
the supreme court may send it to the court of the county whence it was appealed
which, in its opinion, can best determine the controversy.
4355 (1416). Dismission, if record not filed on return-day.—In all cases where
an appeal has been taken to the supreme court, if the copy of the record in the
court below shall not be filed with the clerk of the supreme court on or before the
return-day to which the appeal is returnable by law or by rule of court, it shall be
lawful for the court, on motion of the appellee, to dismiss the appeal, the party
moving for the dismissal producing a copy of the citation properly served, or a cer
tificate of the clerk below that an appeal has been taken ; but the cause may be
re-instated at any time during the term if the party can show that the failure to
file the record was not the result of neglect on his part; and the court. may dispose
of cases brought up for delay out of their proper order.
If the appellant need the aid of the supreme court to get his record sent up, he must make timely appli
cation therefor. Martin v. Phelps, 53 Miss., 134.
4356 (1417). Effect of dismission.—After the dismissal of an appeal or super
sedeas by the supreme court, another appeal or supersedeas shall not be granted in
the same cause, so as to bring it again before the court. .
The statute does not apply where the dismissal is without the fault of the party, or for an irregularity
over which he had no control. Bull v. Harrell, 7 How. (Miss.), 9; Sherman v. Lovejoy, 30 Miss., 105.
A dismissal of an appeal because premature will not bar another from a final judgment in the same
cause. Stokes v. Shannon, 55 Miss., 583.
4357 (1418). Bill of exceptions may embrace matters of record.—The fact
that the verdict or judgment, or any motion or other matter of record, is certified
954

SUPREME COURT.

4358-4360

to the supreme court in a bill of exceptions, instead of in the record distinct from
the bill of exceptions, shall not cause such matter to be disregarded, but it shall
have the same effect as if contained in the record apart from the bill of exceptions.
4358 (1419). Revival on death of party; dismission, when.—It* either the
appellant or the appellee die after the case has been removed to the supreme court,
and before the decision thereof, the suit shall not abate, but the legal representa
tives of the deceased parties may voluntarily make themselves parties, and have the
cause revived; and, if they should fail to do so, they may be brought in by scire
facias; and in like manner the representatives of any co-plaintiff or co-defendant,
who may die pending the suit, may be brought in or come in, and make themselves
parties, and the cause shall proceed for or against them jointly with the surviving
plaintiff or defendant; but if two terms of the court elapse after the death of the
party shall have been suggested on the record of the court, the appeal shall be dis
missed, unless good cause be shown to the contrary; and, if there be an appealbond, judgment may, on the dismissal, be entered against the sureties, as in any
other cases.
4359 (1421). Motion to discharge supersedeas in certain cases. —A motion to
discharge a supersedeas in an appeal to the supreme court may be made before and
heard by the court on ten days' notice to the opposite party, at any time before the
day to which the appeal is returnable, and the court shall make such orders and
render such judgment as may be proper in the case.
4360 (1422). Judgment in certain states of case.—In case the judgment or
decree of the court below be affirmed, or the appellant fail to prosecute his appeal
to effect, the supreme court shall render judgment against the appellant for damages,
at the rate of five per centum and costs, as follows: If the judgment or decree
affirmed be for a sum of money adjudged or decreed against the appellant, the
damages shall be upon such sum; if the judgment or decree be for the possession
of real or personal property, the damages shall be assessed on the value of the
property; if the judgment or decree be for the dissolution of an injunction or other
restraining process at law or in chancery, the damages shall be computed on the
amount due the appellee which was enjoined or restrained; if the judgment or
decree b» for the dissolution of an injunction or other restraining process as to
certain property, real or personal, or a certain interest in property, or be a judg
ment or decree for the sale of property, or some interest in it, to satisfy a sum out
of the proceeds of sale, or to enforce or establish a lien or charge or claim upon or
some interest in property, and the only matter complained of on the appeal is the
decree as to some particular property or claim on it, the damages shall be computed
on the value of the property or the interest in it, if the value of the property or
interest in it be less than the judgment or decree against it ; but if the value of the
property or interest in it be greater than the amount of the judgment or decree
against it, the damages shall be upon the amount of the judgment or decree.
The language of the section, "if the judgment or decree be for the dissolution of an injunction or other
restraining process, at law or in chancery, the damages shall be computed on the amount due the appellee
which was enjoined or restrained," has reference to a suit instituted for the purpose of restraining payment
of a sum due the appellee, and does not apply to the restraint of a writ of garnishment. Johnson v. Devens,
60 Miss., 200.
The appellee is ensitled to damages upon affirmance, whether the decree appealed from have or have no'
been stayed by supersedeas. Tigner v. McGehee, 60 Miss., 242.
955

4361-4366

SUPREME COURT.

Damages are to be allowed only when the judgment or decree of the lower court is ( 1 ) for a sum of money,
(2) where it is for the possession of real or personal property, (3) where it is for the dissolution of aD
injunction or other restraining process at law or in chancery. Clark v. Bank, 61 Miss., 614.
4361 (1423). Where amount in controversy does not appear.—If the value
of the property or the interest in it which is in controversy do not appear in the
record, so as to fix the amount of damages by the judgment of the supreme court,
judgment shall be rendered by said court for damages at five per centum on the
value of the property or interest in dispute, or the amount of the judgment or
decree against it, whichever shall be found to be the smaller, to be ascertained in
the court below, on the remanding of the case, by a writ of inquiry in the circuit
court or reference to a master in chancery; and the case may be remanded for the
damages to be ascertained in the court below, and execution may be issued on the
judgment of affirmance as in other cases, and afterwards another execution may
be issued for the damages when ascertained.
4362 (1425). Judgment on bond for supersedeas.—In case a bond have been
given for a supersedeas, the judgment of the supreme court, on affirming the judg
ment or decree of the court below, or on a dismissal of the appeal by the appellant
or the court, shall be for the money adjudged or decreed against appellant, and
damages and costs, or for the specific property and damages and costs, or for the
damages and costs, as the case may be, against all the obligors in the bond who
may be living at that time, and execution may be issued thereon accordingly; and.
if any of the obligors be dead, his representatives may be summoned to show cause
why judgment should not be rendered against them on the bond; and if good
cause be not shown to the contrary, judgment shall be entered against them in like
manner as against the living obligors, and certified to the court below, and execu
tion may be issued thereon.
4363 (1426). Judgment for costs only in certain cases.—If the appeal-bond
be only for costs, judgment shall be given against the obligors for costs of the
appeal, in case costs be adjudged against the appellant.
4364 (1427). Judgment certified to be enforced.—On receiving the certificate
of the clerk of the supreme court of the judgment of that court in any matter, it
shall be the duty of the clerk of the court below to issue the proper process to
enforce the judgment according to its terms.
4365 (1428). Bond may be excepted to.—The sufficiency of a bond in any
respect as a security, may be excepted to before the supreme court, or a judsre
thereof in vacation, on five days' notice to the opposite party, and, if the exception
be sustained and the security be not immediately perfected, the appeal shall cease
tq operate as a supersedeas, and the supersedeas shall be discharged by order of the
court or judge, and execution may be issued on the judgment or decree appealed
from; and execution may be issued for all costs accrued in the supreme court and
the court below against the obligors in the bond, not to exceed the penalty as
against the sureties; and the supreme court may give judgment on the bond asm
other cases, as if the supersedeas had not been discharged. If necessary, a uevr
execution may be issued on the judgment, although one may have been issued on
the discharge of the supersedeas.
4366 (1429). Voluntary dismission of appeal.—If an appellant shall volun
tarily dismiss his appeal after the transcript of the record has been filed in the
956

supreme court, he shall be liable to judgment by said court as in case of an affirm
ance of the judgment or decree.
4367 (1430). Criminal cases; sentence executed; counsel may prosecute
appeal.—The sentence of the supreme court in all criminal cases brought before it,
shall be executed in like manner as if passed by the court in which the prosecution
originated; and it shall not be necessary to bring any person charged with a crimi
nal offense before the supreme court; but his appeal may be prosecuted by counsel.
4368 (1431). Full time of sentence in case of affirmance.—In case of an
affirmance by the supreme court of a judgment for imprisonment, if the appellant
have remained in prison pending the appeal, the time of imprisonment shall be
credited to him, but if he have been on bail, the supreme court shall fix the time
for the commencement of his imprisonment, under the judgment of affirmance, so
as to cause him to suffer the full time of imprisonment fixed by the judgment of the
court below.
4369 (1432). Appearance to receive judgment in felony.—If the appellant
in a case of felony be on bail, he shall appear before the supreme court to receive
judgment, and, in case of an affirmance, he shall be committed by the court to the
custody of its officer, Avho shall deliver him to the warden of the penitentiary ; and
if the judgment of the court below be reversed, the appellant shall appear before
the circuit court to answer according to the condition of his bond, failing in which
he may be proceeded against as in any case of failure to appear, as obliged to do, in
the circuit court to answer upon a criminal charge.
4370 (1433). Judgment not to be reversed for certain errors.—A judgment
in a criminal case shall not be reversed because the transcript of the record does not
show a proper organization of the court below or of the grand jury, or where the
court was held, or that the prisoner was present in court during the trial or any part
of it, or that the court asked him if he had any thing to say why judgment should
not be pronounced against him upon the verdict, or because of any error or omis
sion in the case in the court below, unless the record show that the errors com
plained of were made ground of special exception in that court.
The observance of every rule for the protection of the accused is as essential now as before the statute
was passed. Its effect is simply*a presumption that the judgment of the lower court is correct, and that all
things were rightly done. The statute is constitutional. Ex parte Phillips, 57 Miss., 357; Spivey v. State, 58
Miss", 743; Fleming v. State, GO Miss., 434.
A case will not be reversed by reason of an omission from the record of even a jurisdictional fact. Hunt
v. State, 61 Miss., 577; Lea v. State, 64 Miss., 201.
The statute does not require a prisoner to except to actions or rulings which are in his favor. Whitten
v. State, 61 Miss., 717.
The statute does not operate in any case to supply proof that an offense has been committed, where the
defendant moves for a new trial because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence. Bryant v.
State, 65 Miss., 435.
4371 (1434). Proceedings on affirmance of sentence of death.—If the judg
ment be affirmed, on appeal, and the offense be punishable with death, the supreme
court shall name the day of execution, and remand the prisoner to the proper
county, if necessary; and the sheriff of the county where the prisoner shall have
been convicted shall execute the sentence. If the sentence be for confinement in
the penitentiary, and the defendant be not present, but in custody, the clerk of the
supreme court shall forthwith notify the warden of the penitentiary as in cases of
957

SUPREME COURT.

conviction for penitentiary offenses in the circuit court, who shall send for the con
vict as provided in such cases.
4372 (1435). Copy of sentence delivered to sheriff.—It shall be the duty ot
the clerk of the court to which the mandate of the supreme court for the execution

the warrant of the sheriff for executing the convict.
4373 (143(3). Prisoner delivered to sheriff of proper county.—If any person
found guilty of a felony shall be in the penitentiary, and the judgment sentencing
him shall be reversed and a new trial ordered, he shall be sent to the jail of the
county in which he was tried by the warden of the penitentiary, and delivered to
the sheriff of the county.
4374. Supreme court clerk to give notice of reversals.—The clerk of the
supreme court shall, within five day's after the reversal of a judgment sentencing
any prisoner to the penitentiary, notify the warden of the penitentiary of the reversal,

4375 (1437). Failure of appellant on bond to appear in felony cases.—If
the appellant in a case of felony do not appear, according to the condition of his
bail-bond, before the supreme court to receive judgment, the court shall proceed as
a circuit court is required to do in case of a failure of a party bound to appear in
like cases, and may issue the proper process, and may render judgment, and enforce
it by execution, and may issue process to any county for the arrest of the appellant,
and have him brought before the court to receive judgment.
4376 (1438). The same; in misdemeanor cases.—If the judgment in acaseot
misdemeanor be affirmed, and the appellant shall not surrender himself to the proper
sheriff, according to the condition of his bail-bond, or shall not appear before the

court, all persons ordered into his custody; and shall be paid his fees therefor out
of the treasury of the proper county, or out of the state appropriation for the
judicial department, when certified by the supreme court.
4378 (1440). Appellant not entitled to reversal for error as to another—IQ
all cases, civil and criminal, a judgment or decree appealed from mayT be affirmed as
to some of the appellants and be reversed as to others ; and one of several appellants
shall not be entitled to a judgment of reversal because of an error in the judgment
or decree against another, not affecting his rights in the case. And when a judgment
or decree shall be affirmed as to some of the appellants and be reversed as to others,
the case shall thereafter be proceeded with, so far as necessary, as if separate suits
had been begun and prosecuted; and execution of the judgment of affirmance may
be had accordingly. Costs may be adjudged in such cases as the supreme court
shall deem proper.
A defendant in a judgment in attachment has no right to complain of errors in a judgment against a
garnishee therein who does not complain. Tabler v. Mitchell, 62 Miss., 437.

4380 (1442). Final judgment to be certified to court below, etc.—Every final
judgment or decree rendered in any cause by the supreme court, shall.be certified
by the clerk thereof to the clerk of the court from which the cause was brought,
or to which it is remanded, within twenty days after the rendition of the judgment,

below, on receiving the certificate, to issue the proper execution on the final judg
ment or decree, if the same be for the plaintiff in the original cause, for the amount
of money or other thing adjudged to the plaintiff, and all costs accrued in the court

then, on receipt of the certificate, execution shall issue against the plaintiff in the

the supreme court shall reverse the judgment or decree of the court below, and
remand the cause to be proceeded with in such court, or remand a cause for further
proceedings, the clerk of the supreme court shall prepare and certify a copy of the
opinion of the supreme court in the case, and send it, with the certificate of the
judgment or decree rendered in the cause by the supreme court, to the clerk of the
court from which the cause was brought, or to which it may be remanded; and the
fees of the clerk for certifying the opinion shall be a part of the taxable costs of
the case in the supreme court; and the copy of the opinion furnished shall be pre

against whom they may be adjudged, execution may be issued against appellant
and the sureties on his appeal-bond for all costs.
4383 (1445). The clerk of the supreme court.—The clerk of the supreme
court, before he enters on the discharge of the duties of his office, shall take the

4421. On lands held by the state.—All the provisions of this chapter giving a
penalty for cutting down, deadening, girdling, boxing, destroying, or taking away
trees of any kind herein mentioned, and regulating the remedy for enforcing the
same, shall apply when the injury is committed on land belonging to the state, or
which is held by the state in trust for any purpose.
4422 (989). To fences, bars, gates, bridges, buildings.—If any person shall
put down any fence or bars, or open any gate, not his own, and leave the same
down or open, without the permission of the owner, or shall in any manner injure
or deface any bridge, building, or other structure not his own, he shall pay to the
owner twenty dollars for every such offense, and shall be liable for all damages
• that may have resulted from such act.
4423 (2816). By firing woods.—If any person shall set on tire any lands of
another, or shall wantonly, negligently, or carelessly allow any fire to get into the
lands of another, he shall be liable to the person injured thereby, not only for the
injury to or destruction of buildings, fences, and the like, but for the burning and
injury of trees, timber, and grass, and damage to the range as well; and shall more
over be liable to a penalty of one hundred and fifty dollars in favor of the owner.
4424 (961, 962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 968). The remedy, when barred, and effect
of a recovery; plaintiff may claim less.-rAn action for any specific penalty given
by this chapter, may be prosecuted in any court of competent jurisdiction within
twelve months from the time the injury was committed, and not after; and a
recovery of any penalty herein given shall not be a bar to any action for further
damages, or to any criminal prosecution for any such offense as herein enumerated.
A party, if he so elect, may, under any of the provisions of this chapter, claim less
than the penalty given.
The statute runs against infants. Miller v. Wesson, 58 Miss., 831.
The remedy, under the statute, is an action of debt, and a count for the value of trees cut may be joined
with one for the statutory penalty. Miller v. Wesson, 58 Miss., 831.
The plaintiff's ownership of the trees or land may be tried in the action for the statutory penalty. Miller
v. Wesson, 58 Miss., 831.
That the defendant was in the adverse possession of the land under claim and color of title, when he
cut the trees, is of itself no defense to the demand for the statutory penalty. Miller v. Wesson, 58 Miss., 831.

CHAPTER 139.
TRIAL OF RIGHT OF PROPERTY.
4425 (1774). Claim of property levied on; how interposed.—When any per
son not a part}* to the execution shall claim to be the owner of or to have a lien on
any personal property levied upon, such person may make affidavit to his right or
title to the property, and may enter into bond, payable to the plaintiff" in the execu
tion, with one or more sufficient sureties, in the penalty of double the value of the
property claimed, or in double the amount of the execution, if that be less than the
value of the property, to be estimated by the officer holding the execution, and
indorsed thereon, conditioned for the' prosecution of the claim with effect, or, in
case of failure therein, for the payment to the plaintiff in the execution of all dam
967

4426-4429

TRIAL OF RIGHT OF PROPERTY.

ages that may be awarded against the claimant, and for the delivery of the property
to the proper officer ; and upon the making of the affidavit and bond, the officer hold
ing the execution shall receive the same, and shall deliver the property to the claim
ant, and return the affidavit and bond with the execution. The claim may be inter
posed without giving bond, and the same proceedings be had thereon, except that
the property claimed shall not be delivered to the claimant, but shall be sold, as
provided in case of property of like kind seized in replevin, or, if not such as should
be sold, shall be held by the officer. The bond of the claimant shall stand as security
to the parties to the action, and judgment may be rendered on it according to the
exigency.
If the claim be dismissed by the court for failure to file the proper affidavit, the dismissal is a determina-.
tion of the claim, and a failure to deliver the property a breach of the claimant's bond. Higdon v. Vaughn,
58 Miss., 572.
A claim cannot be maintained for an undivided interest in personalty. Willis v. Loeb, 59 Miss., 169.
The court from which the execution issued alone has jurisdiction of the claimant's issue. Clark v.
Clinton, 61 Miss., 337.
The statute does not apply to a special execution in replevin. Andrews v. McLeod, 66 Miss.. 348.
4426 (1775). Execution stayed for value of property claimed, unless, etc.—
Further proceedings on the execution shall be stayed for an amount equal to the
value of the property claimed, as returned by the officer, until final decision of the
claim ; and on all subsequent executions issued on the judgment prior to the final
decision of the claim, the clerk shall indorse the amount of the estimated value for
the government of the officer to whom the same mayT be directed; but the plaintiff
may dismiss the levy, and have execution as if it were never made.
4427 (1774). Issue to be made up.—Upon the return of the execution with the
affidavit and bond, if any, the court shall, on motion of the plaintiff in execution,
direct an issue to be made up between the parties to try the right of property at the
same term, unless good cause be shown for a continuance.
Where several executions are levied, there should be separate issues, trials, and judgments. McAnulty
v. Bingaman, 6 How. (Miss.), 382.
If an issue be made and a trial had, it will be presumed to have. been made under the direction of the
court. McAnulty v. Bingaman, 6 How. (Miss.), 382; Phillips v. Cooper, 50 Miss., 722.
After a levy upon property claimed by a third party, subsequent levies upon other property to the full
amount of the execution, though irregular, will not affect the original levy. Davis v. Netterville, 68 Miss., 429.
4428 (1776). Default in making up issue.—If by default of the plaintiff in
execution an issue for the trial of the right of property be not made up at the term
to which the execution is returnable, the court shall discharge the claimant from his
bond, and the property shall not thereafter be subject to execution on plaintiff's
judgment; but if the claimant fail to join issue when tendered at the first term, the
court, at the instance of the plaintiff in execution, shall order a writ of inquiry as
to the value of the property, and also to inquire whether or not the claim was made
for fraudulent purposes or for purposes of delay.
It is the duty of the plaintiff to see that the sheriff returns the execution with the claimant's affidavit
and bond, if any, by a day early enough to have an issue made up and tried at the return-term of the execu
tion. Sears v. Gunter, 39 Miss., 338.
4429 (1777). Burden of proof on plaintiff, and trial.—On the trial of the
issue, the burden of proof shall be on the plaintiff in execution, and the issue shall
be tried as in ordinary actions at law, and either party shall have the same rights as
in other trials; and the jury trying the issue, in case it find in favor of the plaintiff
968

TKIAL OF RIGHT OF PROPERTY.

4430-4431

in execution, shall assess the value of the property subject to the execution, and
shall certify whether the claim was made for fraudulent purposes or for delay. The
valuation of the officer taking the bond of the claimant shall be prima facie evi
dence of the valuation of the property; and in case the jury fail to find the value
of the property, the plaintiff may, at his election, take judgment for the value as
returned by the officer, or have a writ of inquiry.
The jury must assess the separate value of each article. Penrice v. Cocks, 1 How. (Miss.), 227; Walker
v. Commissioners, 1 Smed. & M., 372; Pritchard v. Myers, 3 Smed. & M., 42; Kibble v. Butler, 14 Smed. &
M., 207.
On the trial the execution and levy is a necessary part of the plaintiff's evidence. Ross v. Qarey, 7 How.
(Miss.), 47.
The affidavit is not a part of the record unless made so by a bill of exceptions. Ross v. Garey, 7 How.
(Miss.), 47.
The value is to be fixed as of the day of trial. Selser v. Ferriday, 13 Smed. & M., 698.
If the plaintiff fail to show that the properly is liable to his execution, he cannot recover, even though
claimant have no title. Ross v. Garey, 7 How. (Miss.), 47; Thornhill v. Gilmer, 4 Smed. & M., 153; Selser
v. Ferriday, 13 Smed. & M., 698.
On the trial of the issue, the judgment of the plaintiff against the defendant in attachment is a part of
the record, and need not be offered in evidence. French v. Sale, 60 Miss., 516.
It is error to instruct the jury that the judgment sustaining the attachment is prima facie evidence against
the claimant, and places the burden of proof on him t» show that he is a bona fide purchaser. The burden is
always on the plaintiff to show that the goods are liable to his attachment. Ott v. Smith, 68 Miss., 773.
4430 (1778). The judgment, etc.—If the verdict be in favor of the plaintiff,
either on an issue joined or on an inquiry by default, or in case the plaintiff take
judgment by default and elect to take the value as returned by the officer, the court
shall render judgment against the claimant and the sureties on his bond, for the
restoration of the specific property to the officer, if to be had, and, if not, for the
payment of its value, not exceeding the amount of the original judgment, to the
plaintiff', and all costs; and if the jury find that the claim was made for fraudulent
purposes, or for delay, the judgment shall also award the plaintiff ten per centum
damages on the value of the property. If the property be restored to the officer, it
shall be sold, under a venditioni exponas to be issued for that purpose, as if the
claim had not been made. If bond be not given, and the property or its proceeds
be in the hands of the officer, the judgment may be modified accordingly. If the
verdict be in favor of the claimant, he shall recover his costs, the levy shall be
amoved, the claimant shall be discharged from his bond, and the property shall
not thereafter be subject to execution on plaintiff's judgment.
The jury should not find that the claim was sued out for fraudulent purposes or delay unless there be
evidence to that effect. McAnulty v. Bingaman, 6 How. (Miss.), 382.
The sureties on a claimant's bond cannot assign errors in the suit between the plaintiff and his debtor.
Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 741; Higdon v. Vaughan, 58 Miss., 572.
If the plaintiff succeed as to a part of the property he is entitled to recover costs. Clark v. Parker, 63
Miss.. 549.
The sureties subject themselves to the authority of the court. They are parties to the suit, not in the sense
of participating in the litigation between the plaintiff and the claimant, but they may show any reason good
in law why the bond should not be forfeited. Atkinson v. Foxworth, 53 Miss., 741.
If a claim be interposed by a trustee in a deed in trust, the plaintiff may prove that the deed in trust was
satisfied pending the suit; and in that case he should have judgment for the property, without costs which
accrued before the satisfaction. Helm v. Gray, 59 Miss., 54.
4431 (1779, 1780). Laws applicable in case of death.—All the provisions of
law in reference to the death of either party, and the revival of the cause, in per
sonal actions, and the death of any of the obligors in a bond given in the progress
of a cause, and the proceedings thereon before or after judgment, shall apply to
969

4432-4436

TRIAL OF RIGHT OF PROPERTY.

proceedings under this chapter; but in case the claimant shall die before judgment,
and there be no representative of his estate, judgment shall be entered against the
sureties on his bond for the property, or the value thereof as assessed by the sherifl,
or to be found by the verdict of a jury impaneled to inquire of the same, at the
option of the plaintiff, with interest on such value from the date of the claimant's
bond.
4432 (1781). New bond may be required. —If the sureties on the claimant's
bond shall become insufficient, the court, on motion of the plaintiff, may require
the claimant to give a new bond or to surrender to the officer the property claimed.
If new bond be given, the sureties thereon shall be jointly liable with the sureties
on the first bond, but if the claimant fail to give a new bond and to surrender the
property, judgment shall be rendered against him and the sureties on his bond as
by default. If the claimant surrender the property as required, the sureties ou the
bond given shall thereby be discharged, and the cause shall be proceeded with as if
the officer had retained the property in the first instance.
4433 (1782). Venue changed in certain cases.—If the claimant shall not be a
resident of the county in which the execution is . issued, and the property be levied
on in the county of his residence, the venue for the trial of the issue may be
changed, on his application, to the circuit court of the county of his residence, and
the result shall be certified to the court.
4434 (2227). Proceedings in justice's court. —If the claim be interposed in a
court of a justice of the peace, on filing the affidavit and bond, or the affidavit, if
a bond be not given, the justice shall fix a day for the trial, and give notice thereof
to the parties.
The justice of the peace has jurisdiction to try the claim to property levied on under execution from his
court, although the value of the property exceed two hundred dollars. Clark v. Clinton, 61 Miss., 337; Bernheiraer v. Martin, 66 Miss , 486.
4435 (2257). Form of a claimant's affidavit.—A claimant's affidavit may be
in the following form, viz. :
" State of Mississippi,
County:
"Before me,
, a justice of the peace of said county,
