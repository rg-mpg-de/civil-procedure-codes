believes it to be true. The affidavit shall be made by the party, or if there be several parties united in interest, and pleading together,
by one of such parties if he be within the county in which the action
is brought, and capable of making the affidavit, unless the
action or defence be founded upon a written instrument for the
payment of money only, and such instrument be irr the possession
of the agent or attorney, or if all the materihl allegations of the
pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney,
in which case the affidavit may also be made by such agent or
attorney. If the party pleading shall not be within the county in
which the action is brought, such pleading may be verified by the
party,. his agent or attorney, or by any person having a knowledge
of the facts, and when the affidavit shall be made by any other person
than the party, he shall set forth in it his knowledge, or the

be made by any person acquainted with the facts. The verification

as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading.

shall within ten days after a demand thereof in writing, deliver to
the adNverse party, a copy of such instrument of writing, or the
items of an account, verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true; or be preeluded
from giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof
may order a further account when the one delivered is defective,
and the court may in all cases order a bill of particulars of the
claim of either party to be furnished. I
SEC. 56. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of deenotr-
termining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with
a view of substantial justice between the parties.
SEC. 67. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleadmatter
ing, it may be stricken out on motion of any person aggrieved there- by; and when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or un-
certain that the precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent,
the court may require the pleading to be made definite and
certain by amendment.
SEC. 58. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a
court or officer of special jurisciction, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination
maybe stated to have been duly given or made. If such
allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to
establish on the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.
SEC. 59. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in
a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such
performance, but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be

trial the facts showing such performance. In an action or defence
founded upon an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall
be sumfficient for the party to give a copy of the instrument, and to
state that there is due to him thereon from the adverse party a spe- cific sum which he claims.
SEc. 60. In pleading a private statute, or a right'derived there- it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial
notice thereof.
SEc. 61. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary state in -the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to
state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning
the plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff
shall be bound to establish on trial that it was so published or
spoken.
SEc. 62. In the actions mentioned inithe last section, the defend. ant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the
amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification or not,
he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
SEc. 63. In an action to recover the possession of property, dis- trained doing damage, an answer that the defendant or person by command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real pro- upon which the distress was made, and that the property dis- trained was at the time doing damage thereon, shall be good, without
setting forth the title to such real property.

or any officer or member thereof to appear at a specified

answers to the same on oath.

creditor, unless for cause shown a further time shall be allowed;
in deftult of such answer the judgment creditor may take judgment
by default against him, or the court or judge may punish
him as for contempt.
SEC. 42. Such judgment by default may be -proceeded on to final judgment, in like manner as actions against defendants, but
no final judgment shall be rendered against the garnishee for a
greater amount than that specified in the execution.
SEC. 43. The judgment creditor may except to the answer of any garnishee for insufficiency, and if the same shall be judged
insufficient, the court or judge may allow the garnishee to amend
his answer, in such time and upon such terms as shall be just, or
the judgment creditor may take judgment by default, or move the
court or judge to attach the body of the garnishee to compel a
sufficient answer.
SEC. 44. The judgment creditor may deny the answer of the garnishee in whole or in part, and the issue shall be tried as ordinary
issues between plaintiff and defendant. If the answer of
the garnishee be not excepted to or dcenied in such time as the court
or judge may deem proper, it shall be taken to be true and suficient.
SEc. 45. If by the answer not excepted to nor denied, or if upon
trial it shall appear that the garnishee is possessed of property or
effects of the judgment debtor, or is indebted to him, the value of
such property or effects, or of the debt, being ascertained, judgment
may be rendered against the garnishee for the proper amount
in money, but if such debt be not yet due, execution shall not be
awarded against the garnishee until it becomes due; and in such
cases the court may make him a. reasonable allowance for his
trouble in answering, to be paid out of the fund in his hands.

who have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any
part thereof as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years, or
as entitled to the reversion, remainder or the. inheritance of such
property or any part thereof, after the termination of a particular
estate therein, and who by any contingency may be entitled to a

SEC. 18. When a lien is on an undivided interest or estate of
any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made, shall thereafter
be a charge only on the share assigned to such party; but such
share shall be first charged with its just proportion of the costs of the partition in preference to such lien.
SEc. 19. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold, if there be an estate for life, or years, in an undivided share of the whole property, such estate may be set off in any part of the pro- perty not ordered to be sold.

of priority, by payment of the sums due, and to become due; the
amount remaining due to be verified by affidavit at the time of
payment:

to their respective shares.
SEc. 21. Whenever any party to the action who holds alien upon the property or any part thereof, has other securities for the pay- ment of the amount of such lion, the court may, in its discretion,

such parties, for the determination of their respective claims thereto,

testimony may be taken in court, or by a referee at the discretion
of the court, and the court may, if necessary, require such parties to
present the facts or law in controversy, by pleadings as in original

hereinafter contained, to be invested for the benefit of unknown
owners, infants, or parties out of the territory.
SEC. 26. The referees may take separate mortgages, and other se- curities for the whole, or convenient portions of the purchase. money, on such parts of the property as are directed by the court to
be sold on credit, in the name of the clerk of the district court, and

full age, in the Dame of such owner; and for the shares of an infant,
in the name of the guardian of such infant.
SEC. 27. When the estate of any tenant for life or years, in any
undivided part of the property in question, shall have been admitted
by the parties, or ascertained by the court to be existing at
the time of the order of sale, and the person entitled to such estate
shall have been made a party to the action, such estate may be first
set off out of any part of the property, and a sale made of such parcel,
subject to the prior unsold estate of such tenant therein; but if
in the judgment of the court, a due regard to the interest of all the
parties require that such estate be also sold, the sale may be so
ordered.

undivided part of the property, whose estate shall have been sold,

to accept instead thereof, by an instrument in writing, filed with the
clerk of the court. Upon the filing of such consent, the clerk shall
enter the same in the minutes of the court.

vided in the last section, before the report of sale by the referees,
the court shall ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds
of the sale, after deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable
sum to be invested for the benefit of the person entitled to
such estate for life or years, and shall order the same to be paid to
such party or deposited in court for him as the case may require.
SEC. 30. If the persons entitled to such estate for life or years be
unknown, the court shall provide for the protection of their rights,
in the same manner as far as may be, as if they were known and
had appeared.
SEC. 31. In all cases of sales in partition, when it shall appear
that any person has a vested or contingent future right, or estate in
any part of the property sold, the court shall ascertain and settle
the proportional value of such contingent or vested right or estate,
according to the principles of law applicable to annuities and survivorship,
and shall direct such proportion of the proceeds of sale
to be invested, secured or paid over in such manner, as to protect
the rights and interests of the parties.

either of them, shall be interested in any purchase; nor shall the

property, being the subject of the action, except for the benefit of
the infant. All sales contrary to the provisions of this section, shall

on interest, for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto.

clerk of the district court of the county where the papers are filed,

benefit of the parties interested, subject to the order of the court.

kept for that purpose in the clerk's office, free for inspection by all

the use and enjoyment of a right, or office to which he is entitled,
and from which he is unlawfully precluded by such inferior tribunal,
corporation, board or person.
SEc. 2. This writ shall only be issued in cases where there is not
a speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law. It shall be issued upon affidavit on the application of the
party beneficially interested.
SEc. 3. The writ shall be either alternative or peremptory. The
alternative writ shall state concisely the facts, showing the obligation
of the party to whom it is directed to perform the act, and his
omission to perform iz, and command him that immediately after
the receipt of the writ, or some other specified time, he do the act
required to be performed, or show cause before the court out of which the writ issued, at a specified time and place, why he has
not done so, and that he then and there return the writ with his
certificate of what .he has done. The peremptory writ shall be in

proceedings avail himself of any valid objection to its sufficiency,
or may countervail it by proof, either in direct denial or by way
-of avoidance.

possessing the qualifications for jurors, in the district court, to be
summoned to appear forthwith before the court to try such issue;
and in case any of the jurors so summoned, should for any cause
be rejected or be disqualified to act as a juror in the case, the

shall also be awarded without delay.
SEC. 13. Whenever a peremptory mandamus has been issued and
directed to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person commanding
the performance of any public duty, specially enjoined by
law, if it appear to the court that any meiber of such inferior tribunal,
corporation, or board, or such person upon whom the writ
has been personally served, has without just excuse refused or
neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose
on him a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars. Such fine when
collected, shall be paid into the territorial treasury. In case of persistence
in a refusal of obedience, the court may order the party to
be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months, and may
take any orders necessary and proper for the complete enforcement
of the writ.

original jurisdiction in cases of mandamus, except in cases when

to the court or judge to be sufficient, a writ shall be thereupon
issued, which shall command the court and party, or officer to

proceedings in the suit, or matter specified therein, until the next
term of the supreme court, or the further order of the court thereon;

in term time, why they should not be absolutely restrained from
any further proceeding in such action or matter.

officer to whom it shall be directed, in the same manner as a writ
of mandamus; and a return shall in like manner be made thereto
by such court or officer, which may be enforced by attachment.
SEC. 17. The court and party or officer on whom the writ shall
have been served, may by the return or answer under oath, show
cause why they should not be restrained as mentioned in the writ
of prohibition; and the person prosecuting such writ may take
issue or demur to the matters relied on in the return or answer by
such court and party or officer; and the like proceedings shall be
had for the trial of such issues of law or fact, joined between the parties, and for the rendering of judgment thereon as in a mandamus.
SEc. 18. The court after hearing the proofs and allegations of the parties, shall render judgment, either that a prohibition absolute restraining the said court and party or officer from proceeding in such action or matter, do issue, or authorizing the court and party

body, it shall, in like manner, be construed severally to all persons
intended to be secured, as well as to the body politic named

thereon, in his own name, against the officer and his sureties to
recover the amount to which he may he entitled, by reason of the
delinquency.
SEC. 3. Before an action can be brought by the plaintiff, other than the territory or body politic named in the security, leave
shall be obtained of the district court, or a judge thereof,-within
the district or county where the action is triable; and leave shall

affidavit showing the delinquency, and if the delinquency be such

against him on the same, to pay amounts which, in the
aggregate, are equal to the extent of his undertaking, or that by
reason of the insolvency of his principal he will be obliged to pay
to that extent on judgments already recovered against the surety,
the recovery against a surety shall in all such cases, be limited by
the amount of his undertaking, except as otherwise provided by
law.
SEC. 6. Upon the execution issued on a judgment recovered
upon the official security of a public officer against him and a
surety, there shall be indorsed a direction to the officer to whom

collect it out of the property of the surety.
SEC. 7. If there te several judgments on which executions are
at the same time in the sheriff's hands against a public officer and
his sureties, amounting in the aggregate to a sum greater than
that for which the sureties are liable, the court shall on their application,

of their respective liabilities, and may cause the same to be applied
on the judgments or executions in proportion to their amounts.

shall not prevent the recovery of the same by another person.
SEC. 11. Fines and forfeitures not specially granted or approto
ritdb.
printed by law, shall be paid into the territorial treasury; and
whenever by the provision of law any property, real or personal,
shall be forfeited to the territory, or to any officer for its use, an
