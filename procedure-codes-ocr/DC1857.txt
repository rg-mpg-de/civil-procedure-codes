SEC. 3. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real
party in interest, except as otherwise provided in this chapter; but 
this section shall not be deemed to authorize the assignment of a thing
in action not arising out of contract. 
SEC. 4. In the case of an assignment of a thing in action, the action
by the assignee shall be without prejudice to any set-off or other de­ 
fence existing before notice of the assignment; but this section shall
not apply to a negotiable promissory note or bill of exchange, trans·
ferred, in good faith and upon valuable consideration, before due. 
SEC. 5. An executor, administrator, guardian, trustee of an express
trust, a person with whom or in whose name a contract is made for
the benefit of another, or a person expressly authorized by statute, 
may bring an action without joining with him the person for whoso
benefit it is prosecuted. It shall not be necessary to make an insane
person a joint party with his guardian or committee, except as may be
required by statute. 
SEc. 6. In all cases where actions survive, they may be commenced
by or against the representatives of the deceased, to whom the interest
of the subject-matter of the action has passed, 
SEC. 1. When a married woman is a party, her husband must be
joined with her; except-- 
First. When the action concerns her separate property, she may
sue alone. 
Second. When the action is between herself and her husband, she
may sue and be sued alone; but when her husband cannot be joined
with her, as is herein provided, and she is an infant under twenty-one 
years of age, she shall prosecute and defend by her next friend.
SEC. 8. If a husband and wife be sued together, the wife may de­ 
fend in her own right; and if the husband neglect to defend, she may
defend in his right also. 
SEC. 9. The action of an infant must be brought by his guardian or
next friend. When the action is brought by his next friend, the
court shall have power to dismiss it, if it is not for the benefit of the
infant, or to substitute the guardian of the infant, or any person as 
the next friend. 
SEC. 10. The defence of an infant shall be by guardian for the suit,
who may be appointed by the court in which the action is prosecuted.
Tho appointment may be made upon the application of the infant, if 
he be of the age of fourteen years, and apply within fifteen days after
the return of the summons. If he be under the age of fourteen, or 
neglect so to apply, the appointment may be made upon the applica­
tion of any friend of the infant, or on that of the plaintiff in the 
action. 
SEC. 11. All persons having an interest in the subject of the action
and in obtaining the relief demanded, shall be joined as plaintiffs)
except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
SEC. 12. Any person may be made a defendant who has or claims
an interest in the controversy adverse to the plaintiff, or who is a
necessary party to a. complete determination or settlement of the
questions involved therein. 
SEC. 13. Of the parties to the action, those who are united in in­
terest shall be joined as plaintiffs or defendants ; but if the consent of
one who should have been joined as plaintiff cannot be obtained, he
may be made a defendant, the reason being stated in the complaint. 
SEC. 14. When the question is one of common or general interest
of many persons, or when the parties are very numerous and it may 
be impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may
sue or defend for the benefit of all. 
SEC. 15. Persons severally and immediately liable upon the same
obligation or instrument, including the parties to bills of exchange
and promissory notes, may all or any of them be included in the samo
action, at the option of the plaintiff.

ability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest therein during
its pendency, if the cause of action survive or continue. In the case
of the marriage of a female party, the fact being suggested on the
record, the husband may be made a party with his wife ; and in case
of the death or other disability of a party, the court may allow the
action to be continued by or against his representative or successor in
interest. In case of any other transfer of interest, the action may be
continued in the name of the original party, or the court may allow 
the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the 
action. 
SEC. 17. The court may determine any controversy between parties
before it, when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of others,
or by saving their rights; but when a complete determination of the 
controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the
court shall cause them to be joined as proper parties. 
SEc. 18. When, in an action for the recovery of real or personal
property, any person having an interest in the property applies to 
be made a party, the court may order it to be done by the proper
amendment. 
SEc. 19. A defendant against whom an action is pending upon a
contract, or for specific real or personal property, may, at any time 
before answer, upon affidavit that a person not a party to the action,
and without collusion with him, makes against him o. demand for the
same debt or property, upon due notice to such person and to the ad­
verse party, apply to the court for an order to substitute such person
in his place, and discharge him from liability to either party, on his
depositing in court the amount of the debt, or delivering the property 
or its value to such person, as the court may direct, and the court may,
in its discretion, make the order. 
SEC. 20. An unmarried female may prosecute as plaintiff an action
for her own seduction, and recover such damages as may be assessed 
in her favor. 
SEC. 21. A father, or, in case of his death or desertion of his

The action shall be deemed to be commenced from the time of issuing 
the summons;. but as to those .against whom publication is made,
from the time of the first publication.

substance, as follows : 
1. In an action arising on contract for the recovery of money or
damages only, that the plaintiff will take judgment for a sum specified 
therein, if the defendant fail to answer the complaint.
2. In other actions, that if the defendant fail to answer the com­ 
plaint, the plaintiff will apply to the court for the relief demanded
therein. 
SEC. 5. The summons shall be served by the marshal of this Dis­
trict, or by his deputy, or by a person specially appointed by him, or
by a person appointed by the court. The summons shall be returned, 
with the certificate of the officer of its service, to the office of the
clerk from which the summons issued. 
SEC. 6. The summons shall be served by delivering a copy thereof,
as follows: 
1. If the suit be against a corporation, to the president or head of
the corporation, secretary, cashier, or managing agent thereof. 
2. If against a minor, to such minor personally, and also to his

SEC. 7. When the service of the summons cannot be made as pre­ 
scribed in the last preceding section, and when that fact appears, by
affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, or any judge thereof, and it 
appears, in like manner; that a cause of action exists against the
defendant, and that the case is one ·of those mentioned hereafter in
this section, the court or judge may grant an order that service be
made by publication, in either of the following cases: 
1. In actions for the recovery of real property, or of an estate or
interest therein, or for the partition of real property, or for the sale
of real property under a mortgage, lien, or otherwise, where the real
property is within this District, and where any or all of the defendants
reside out of the same. 
2. In actions brought to establish or set aside a will, where any or
all the defendants reside out of this District. 
3. In actions brought against a non-resident of this District, or a
foreign corporation having in this District property or debts owing 
to them subject to the process of the court.
4. In actions which relate to, or the subject of which is, real or 
personal property in this District, where any defendant has or claims
a lien. or interest, actual or contingent, therein, or the relief demanded
consists wholly or partly in excluding him from any interest therein, 
and such defendant is a non-resident of this District or a foreign
corporation. 
5. In all actions where the defendant, being a resident of this
District, has departed therefrom with intent to delay or defraud hie
creditors, or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself 
concealed therein with a like intent.

section, whether he shall have acquired a residence elsewhere or not. 
SEC. 8. The order shall direct the publication to be made in a
newspaper to be published in this District, and for such a length of 
time as may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week for six
successive weeks, unless where otherwise provided. In case of publi­ 
cation, the court or judge shall direct a copy of the summons and
complaint to be forthwith deposited in the post office, directed to the 
defendant at his place of residence, unless it shall appear that such
residence is not known. When publication is ordered, personal ser­ 
vice of a copy of the summons and complaint out of this District
shall be equivalent to publication and deposit in the post office. In 
either case the service of the summons shall be deemed complete at
the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.
The publication shall contain a summary statement of the object and 
prayer of the petition, mention the court wherein it is filed, and
notify the person or persons thus to be served when they are required 
to answer. 
SEc. 9. Parties against whom a judgment has been rendered without
other notice than the publication in· the newspaper in this chapter
required, except in cases of divorce, may, at any time within five 
years after the rendition of the judgment, have the same opened, and
be allowed to defend. 
SEc. 10. But before any such judgment shall be opened, such party
shall give notice to the original complainant, or his heirs, devisees, 
executors, or administrators, of bis intention to make application to
have the judgment opened, and shall file a full answer to the original 
complaint, and an affidavit stating that, during the pendency of the
action, he received no actual notice thereof in time to appear in court
and object to the judgment, and shall also pay all such costs of the 
action as the court shall direct. The adverse party shall be allowed
to present counter affidavits to show that, during the pendency of the
action, the applicant had notice thereof in time to appear in court 
and make his defence. 
SEc. 11. If any property which was the subject of, or properly sold
under, any judgment sought to be opened as provided in the last two 
preceding sections, shall have passed into the hands of a purchaser
in good faith, he shall not be affected by any proceedings consequent 
upon the opening of the judgment.
SEC. 12. In cases where it shall be necessary to make any persons 
defendants to any action, and the names of any or all of them shall
be unknown to the plaintiff, and he shall annex to his complaint an 
affidavit of his want of knowledge of their names, and that their
residence is, as he verily believes, not in this District, proceedings
may be had against them without naming them; and the court shall
make such order respecting notice and the publication thereof as may 
be deemed proper.
SEC. 13. Whenever it shall appear by the return of the marshal, 
his deputy, or the person appointed to serve a summons, that he has
not served it upon the defendants as prescribed in the-sixth section of 
this chapter, the clerk shall, at the request of the plaintiff, issue
another summons, and so on until service be had; or the plaintiff
may proceed by publication in the manner before stated, at his
election. 
SEC. 14. Where the action is against two or more defendants, and
the summons is served on one or more, but not all of them, the 
plaintiff may proceed as follows:
1. If the action be against defendants jointly indebted upon a con­ 
tract, he may proceed against the defendants served,. unless the court
otherwise direct; and if he recover judgment, it may be entered 
against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it
may be enforced against the joint property of all, and the separate
property of the defendants served ; and if they are subject to arrest,
against the persons of the defendants served; or, 
2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may,
without prejudice to his rights against those not served, proceed
against the defendants served, in the same manner as if they were the 
only defendants.
SEC. 15. A voluntary appearance of the defendant shall be equiva­ 
lent to a personal service of the summons upon him.

names of parties to the action, plaintiff and defendant ; 
2. A plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the cause
of action, without unnecessary repetition ; 
3. A demand of the relief which the plaintiff claims. If the re­
covery of money or damages be demanded, the amount thereof shall
be stated. 
SEC. 5. The defendant may demur to the complaint only when it
appears upon the face thereof, eitber- 
1. That the court bas no jurisdiction of the person of the defend­
ant, or the subject of the action; or, 
2. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue; or,
3. That there is another action pending between the same parties 
for the same cause ; or,
4. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant ; or, 
5. That several causes of action have been improperly united; or,

tion to the complaint ; unless it do so, it may be disregarded.

one or more of several causes of action stated therein, and answer the
residue. 
SEC. 8. If the complaint be amended, the amendments shall be filed
and a copy served upon the defendant, or his attorn~y, if. he has 
appeared by attorney; the defendant shall answer the same within
such time as may be prescribed by the court; and if he omit to do so,
the plaintiff may proceed to obtain judgment, as in other cases of
failure to answer. 
SEC. 9. When any of the matters enumerated in section five of this chapter do not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection 
may be taken by answer.
SEC. 10. If no objection be taken, either by demurrer or answer, 
the defendant shall be deemed to have waived the same, excepting
only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, and the objection
that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. 
SEC. 11. The answer of' the defendant shall contain-
1. In respect to each allegation of the complaint controverted by 
the defendant, a general or specific denial thereof, or a denial thereof
according to his information and belief, or of any knowledge thereof
sufficient to form a belief; 
2. A plain and concise statement of any new matter constituting a
defence, counter-claim or set-off, without unnecessary repetition. 
SEC. 12. The defendant may set forth in his answer as many grounds
of defence, counter-claim, or set-off, as he may have, whether they be
such as aave been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both. 
They shall be stated separately and refer to the causes of action which
they are intended to answer, in any manner by which they may be 
intelligibly distinguished. 
SEC. 13. The counter-claim mentioned in the last preceding section
must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against a plaintiff
between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and
arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint
as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the sub­
ject of the action. 
SEC. 14. If any defendant personally served with notice omit to
set up a counter-claim arising out of the contract or transaction set
forth in the complaint as the ground of the plaintiff's claim, he shall
not afterwards maintain an action therefor. If the defendant omit to
set up the set-off, he shall not recover costs against the plaintiff in 
any subsequent action thereon.
SEC. 15. When cross-demands have existed between persons under 
such circumstances that if one had brought an action against the
other, a counter-claim or set-off could have been set up, neither can
be deprived of the benefit thereof by the assignment or death of the 
other, but the two demands must be deemed compensated so far as
they equal each other. 
SEC. 16. A set-off can only be pleaded in an action founded on con­
tract, and must be a cause of action arising upon contract or ascer­
tained by the decision of the court, held by the defendant at the time 
suit was commenced, and matured at or before the time it is offered
as a set off . 
SEC. 17. Where it is necessary for the defendant to bring a new
party before the court, he may state the matter relating thereto in
his answer, and demand relief; and thereupon a summons shall issue, 
and other proceedings be had against him, as if such matter had been
exhibited in the original complaint. 
SEC. 18. Several defendants may answer, jointly or severally, as
the facts set forth in the complaint may require. 
SEC. 19. When the facts stated in the answer are not sufficient to
constitute a cause of defence, the plaintiff may demur to one or more
of several defences, under the same rules and regulations as are 
hereinbefore prescribed for demurring to the complaint. Unless the
objection be taken by demurrer it shall be deemed as waived. 
SEC. 20. It shall be the duty of the guardian of an infant, or com­
mittee of a person of unsound mind, or attorney for a person in prison, 
to file an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint
prejudicial to such defendant, without oath. 
SEC. 21. All defences, except the mere denial of the facts alleged
by the plaintiff, shall be plee.ded specially. 
SEC. 22. There shall be no reply, except upon the allegation of a
counter-claim or set-off, in the answer. 
SEC. 23. When the answer contains new matter constituting a
counter-claim or set-off, the plaintiff may reply to such new matter,
denying, generally or specifically, each allegation controverted by 
him ; and he may allege, in ordinary and concise language, and
without repetition, any new matter, not inconsistent with the com­ 
plaint, constituting a defence to such new matter in the answer ; or 
he may demur ·to the same for insufficiency, stating in his demurrer
the grounds thereof; and he may demur to one or more of such 
defences set up in the answer, and reply to the residue. 
SEc. 24. The answer or demurrer by the defendant shall be filed
on or before the fourth Saturday, and the reply or demurrer by the
plaintiff on or before the seventh Saturday, after the return day of the 
summons or service by publication.
SEC. 25. If from any cause either party shall fai] to plead or make 
up the issues within the time prescribed by law and the rules of the
court, the court shall forthwith enter judgment as .upon a default, 
unless, for good reasons shown, further time be given for pleading,
on the payment of costs occasioned by the delay. 
SEc. 26. Every pleading shall be subscribed by the party or his
attorney, and when any pleading is verified every subsequent plead­ 
ing, except a demurrer, must be verified also, except as is provided
in the next two succeeding sections. · 
SEC. 27. The verification must be to the effect that the same is true
to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those matters 
stated on information and belief, and as to those matters that he
believes them to be true, and must be by affidavit of the party, or if
there be several parties united in interest and pleading together, by 
one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party
be within this District and capable of making the affidavit. The 
affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the .action or
defence be founded upon a written instrument for the payment of
money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent
or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the pleading be with.in 
the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the plead­
ing is verified by any other person than the party, he sho.11 set forth 
in the affidavit his knowledge or the grounds of his belief on the sub­
ject, and the reasons why it is not made by the party. When a cor­
poration is a party the verification may be made by any officer thereof; 
and when the United States, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is a
party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with 
the facts. The verification may be omitted when an admission of the
truth of the allegation might subject the party to prosecution for 
felony. And no pleading can be used in a criminal prosecution
against the party as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such
pleading. 
SEC. 28. Verification of a pleading shall not make other or greater
proof necessary on the side of the adverse party, except where other­ 
wise expressly provided. The verification shall not be required to
the answer of a guardian defending for an infant, or insane person, 
or person imprisoned. In all cases where the party plea.ding is a
non-resident of this District, or if he shall be absent from this District,
an affidavit, made before filing the pleading, stating the substance of
the facts afterwards inserted in the pleading, shall be a sufficient
verification; and such affidavit shall be filed with the pleading 
intended to be verified thereby. 
SEc. 29. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in the
pleading the items of an account therein alleged; he shall deliver to 
the adverse party, within ten days after a demand thereof in writing,
a copy of the account, which, if the pleading is verified, must be 
verified by his. own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, if within
the personal knowledge of such agent or attorney, to the effect that 
he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence
thereof. The court may order a further account when the one given
is defective; and the court may in all cases order a bill of partioulars
of the claim of either party to be furnished. 
SEc. 30. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed,
with a view of substantial justice between the parties. 
SEC. 31. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading,
it may be stricken out on motion of any person aggrieved thereby. 
And when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite and uncer­
tain that the precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent,
the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by 
amendment.
SEC. 32. When an action is brought upon a written instrument, 
and the complaint contains a copy of such instrument, or the original
or a copy annexed thereto, the genuineness and due execution of 
such instrument shnll be deemed admitted, unless the answer denying
& he same be verified. 
SEC. 33. When the defence to an action is founded upon a written 
instrument, and a copy thereof ie contained in the answer, or the
original or a copy is annexed thereto, the genuineness and due execu­
tion of such instrument shall be deemed admitted, unless the plaintiff 
file with the clerk, five days previous to the commencement of the
term at which the action is to be tried, an affidavit denying the same. 
SEc. 34. All fictions in pleading are abolish ed. 
SEC. 35. In pleading a judgment or decision of a court or officer of
special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the facts conferring 
jurisdiction ; but such judgment or determination shall be stated to 
have been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial the facts 
conferring jurisdiction. 
SEC. 36. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such
performance ; but it may be stated generally that the party duly 
performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be
controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the
trial the facts showing such performance. 
SEc. 37. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom,
it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of
its passage or approval, and the court shall thereupon take judicial
notice thereof. 
SEC. 38. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of show­ 
ing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of
which the cause of action arose ; but it shall be sufficient to state
generally that the same wa.s published or spoken concerning the
plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff' shall 
be bound to establish on the trial that it was so published or spoken. 
SEC. 39. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant
may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as
defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount 
of damages ; and whether he prove the justification or not, he may
give in evidence the mitigating circumstances. 
SEC. 40. The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several
causes of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denomi­ 
nated legal or equitable, or both, ~hen they are included in either
one of the following classes : 
. 1. The same transaction, or transactions connected with the same
subject of action. 
2. Contracts, expressed or implied.
8. Injuries, with or without force, to person and property, or 
either. 
4. Injuries to character.
5. Claims to recover the possession of personal property, with or 
without damages for the withholding thereof. 
6. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for
the withholding thereof, or for waste, aud the rents and profits of the
same. 
7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract or by operation
of law. 
The causes of action so united must affect all the parties to the
action, and not require different places of trial, and must be sepa­ 
rately stated. 
SEC. 41. When the action arises out of contract, the plaintiff may
join such other matters in his complaint as may be necessary for a 
complete remedy and a speedy satisfaction of his judgment, although
such other matters fall within some other one or more of the foregoing
classes. When several causes of action are united belonging to any
of the foregoing classes, the court may order separate trials for the
furtherance of justice. 
SEC. 42. Every material allegation of the complaint not contro­
verted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter 
in the answer constituting a counter-claim or set-off, not controverted
by the reply, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true;
but the allegation of new matter in the answer not relating to a 
counter-claim or set-off, or of new matter in the reply, shall be
deemed to be controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require. AUegations of value,
or of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true by failure to 
contradict them. 
SEC. 43. The allegations of a complaint against the defendant
constructively summoned, and who has not appeared, except such as 
are for his benefit, shall not be taken as true, but shall be established
by proof. If, however, the plaintiff in an action against a defendant
constructively summoned, and who has not appeared, files with the 
complaint his own affidavit, stating that any. of the allegations
thereof recited in the affidavit are true, and known to be so by the
defendant, and that they cannot be proved or shown except by his
answer, so far as the plaintiff' knows or believes, such allegations, 
unless denied by the answer, shall be taken as true. 
SEc. 44. Neither presumptions of law, nor matters of which judicial
notice is taken, need be stated in a pleading. 
SEC. 45. If an original pleading or paper be lost, or withheld by
any person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be substituted. 
SEC. 46. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proof is to be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the
adverse party to hie prejudice, in maintaining his action or defence 
upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has been so
misled, that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and 
it must also· be shown in what respect be has been misled; and there­
upon the court may order the pleading to be amended upon such
terms as may be just. 
SEC. 47. When the variance is not material as provided in the last
preceding section, the court may direct the fact to be found according 
to the evidence, and may order an immediate amendment without
costs. 
SEC. 48. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action or
defence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some par­ 
ticular or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it
shall not be deemed a case of variance within the ]a.st two sections, 
but a failure of proof. 
SEc. 49. Any pleading may be once amended by the party, of course,
without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, 
at any time before the period of answering it shall expire; in such
case a copy of the amended pleading shall be served on the adverse 
party, and he shall have the same time to answer, reply, or demur
thereto as to the original pleading. At any time within ten days 
after a demurrer is filed, the adverse party may amend, of course, on
payment of costs since the defective pleading ; and in such case a copy 
of the amended pleading shall be forthwith served on the adverse
party, who shall have the same time thereafter to answer or reply 
thereto u to an original pleading. 
SEC. 50. After the decision upon a demurrer, if it be overruled,
and it appears that such demurrer was interposed in good faith, the
court may, in its discretion, allow the party to plead over upon such
terms as may be proper. If the demurrer be allowed for the cause
mentioned in _the fifth subdivision of section five of this chapter, the
court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, 
order tho action to be divided into as many actions as may be 
necessary to the proper determination of the causes of action therein
mentioned. 
SEC. 51. The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance
of justice, and on such terms 88 may be proper, amend any pleading,
process, or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any 
party, or by correcting a. mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect, or when the amendment does not change 
substantially the claim or defence by conforming the pleading or
proceeding to the facts proved. . 
SEc. 52. The court may likewise, in its discretion, and upon such
terms 88 may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other 
act to be done, after the time limited by this chapter, or by an order
enlarge such time ; and may also, in its discretion, and upon such
terms as may be just, at any time within one year after notice thereof, 
relieve a party or his legal representatives from a judgment, order,
or other proceeding, taken against him through his mistake, inad­
vertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ; and may supply an omission
in any proceeding. 
SEc. 53. Whenever the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of
a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by any name, and when hie true name shall be discovered,
the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly. 
SEC. 54. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard
any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not
affect the substantial rights of the adverse party ; and no judgment
shall be reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect. 
Sxc. 55. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed,
on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer, or reply, 
alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former com­
plaint, answer, or reply. 
SEC. 56. When any party shall amend any pleading or proceeding, 
and the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the
adverse party could not be ready for trial in consequence thereof, a 
postponement may be granted to some day in term, or a continuance
to another term of the court.

larly describing it) or is lawfully entitled to the possession thereof
by virtue of a special property therein, the facts in respect to which

It shall state the names of the parties to the action, and the court in
which the action is brought, and direct the marshal to take the 
property, describing it, and stating its value, as in the affidavit, and
deliver it to the plaintiff upon his executing the undertaking specified
in section five of this chapter. 
SEC. 5. The marshal shall forthwith proceed to execute said order,
but before taking possession of such property, be shall take from the
plaintiff, or some person in his behalf, a written undertaking, payable 
to the defendant, with sufficient surety to be approved by the marshal,
to the effect that the plaintiff will prosecute his action with effect and
without delay, and that he will return the property to the defendant
if return thereof be adjudged by the court, and that he will pay to
the defendant all such sums of money as may be recovered against
him by the defendant in the action for any cause whatever ; which
written undertaking shall be delivered to the marshal, and in default
thereof the property shall remain with the defendant, but the action
shall not be dismissed or delayed thereby. The return day of the
order, when issued at commencement of the action, shall be the same
as that of the summons; when issued afterwards, it shall be twenty 
days after it is issued. 
SEC. 6. If the property, or any part thereof, be concealed in a
building or enclosure, the marshal shall demand its delivery; if it
shall not be delivered, he shall cause the building or enclosure to be 
broken open, and take the property in hie possession ; and if neces­
sary he may call to his aid the power of the county. If the marshal
cannot find the property, or any part thereof, the action shall not 
abate, but be prosecuted to final judgment. 
SEC. 7. When it appears by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or other
person in his behalf, or by the return of the officer, that the property
claimed has been disposed of or concealed, so that the order cannot
be executed, the court may compel the attendance of the defendant, 
examine him on oath as to the situation of the property, and punish
a wilful obstruction or hindrance of the execution of the order, and a
disobedience of the orders of the court in this respect, as in cases of 
a contempt.

tion. 
SEC. 2. An injunction may be granted in the following cases:
1. When it shall appear by the complaint that the plaintiff is 
entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof,
consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act com­
plained of, either for a limited period or perpetually. 
2. When it shall appear by the complaint or affidavit that the
commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would 
produce great or irreparable injury to the plaintiff.
3. When it shall appear during the litigation that the defendant 
is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering
to be done, some act in violation of the plaintiff's rights respecting
the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment 
ineffectual.
4. In any case where it is specially authorized by statute. 
SEC. 3. The injunction may be granted at the time of issuing the
summons upon the complaint, and at any time afterwards, before 
judgment, upon affidavits. The complaint in the one case, and the
affidavits in the other, shall show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds
exist therefor. No injunction shall be granted on the complaint 
unless it be verified by the oath of the plaintiff, or some one in his
behalf, that the person making the oath has read the complaint, or
heard the complaint read, and knows the contents thereof, and the
same is true of his own knowledge, except the matters therein stated 
on information and belief, and that as to those matters he believes it 
to be true. When granted on the complaint, a copy of the complaint
and verification attached shall be served with the injunction ; when 
granted upon affidavit, a copy of the affidavit shall be served with the
injunction. 
SEC. 4. An injunction shall not be allowed after the defendant has
answered, unless upon notice, or upon an order to show cause ; but
in such case the defendant may be restrained until the decision of the 
court or judge granting or refusing the injunction.
SEC. 5. On granting an injunction the court or judge shall require, 
except where the United States are a party plaintiff, a written under­
taking on the part of the plaintiff, with sufficient sureties, to the effect 
that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined such damages, not
exceeding an amount to be specified, as such party may sustain by 
reason of the injunction, if the court shall finally decide that the
plaintiff was not entitled thereto. 
SEC. 6. If the court or judge deem it proper that the defendant, or
any of several defendants, should be heard before granting the injunc­
tion, an order may be made requiring cause to be shown, at a specified
time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, and the
defendant may in the meantime be restrained. 
SEc. 7. A party enjoined may, at any time before judgment, upon
reasonable notice to the party who has obtained the injunction, move
the court for additional security; and if it appear that the surety in 
the undertaking has removed from this District, or is insufficient, the
court may dissolve the injunction, unless in a reasonable time suffi­
cient security is given. 
SEC. 8. If an injunction be granted without notice, the defendant,
at any time before the trial, may apply, upon reasonable notice, to
the judge who granted the injunction, or to the court, to dissolve or
modify the same. The application may be made upon the complaint
and the affidavit on which the injunction was granted, or upon affi­ 
davit on the part of the defendant, with or without answer. If the
application be made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, but
not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other
evidence in addition to that on which the injunction was granted. 
SEC. 9. If upon such application it satisfactorily appear that. there
is not sufficient ground for the injunction, it shall be diasolved, or if 
it satisfactorily appear that the extent of the injunction is too great, it 
shall be moained,

SEC. 1. In an action for the recovery of money, the plaintiff, at 
the time of issuing the summons, or at any time afterwards, may
have the property of the defendant attached, in the cases and in the 
manner hereinafter prescribed, as a security for the satisfaction of 
such judgment as he may recover. 
SEC. 2. A writ of attachment shall be issued by the clerk whenever
the plaintiff, or some other person in his behalf, shall make affidavit
that a cause of action exists against such defendant, specifying the
amount of such claim over and above all legal set-offs, and the nature
thereof, and that, as the affiant verily believes, the defendant is
either- 
1. A foreign corporation; or,
2. That he is not a resident of this District, or has departed there­ 
from with the intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid the service
of a summons ; or: 
3. That he so conceals himself that a smnmons cannot be served
upon him; or, 
4. That he has assigned, secreted, removed, or disposed of, or is
about to assign, secrete, remove, or dispose of, his property not exempt 
from execution, or a part thereof, with the intent to defraud his
creditors ; or, 
5. That the debt was fraudulently contracted.
The affidavit required by this section shall be attached to the writ 
upon issuing the same. But no attachment shall issue on the ground
that the defendant is a foreign corporation or a non-resident of this 
District, except for a debt or demand arising upon contract, judgment,
or decree, or upon an injury to person or property committed within 
this District.
SEC. 3. Before issuing the writ, the clerk shall require a written 
undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, in a sum not less than two
hundred dollars, and not exceeding the amount claimed by the
plaintiff when the same is more than two hundred dollars, with 
sufficient sureties, to the effect that if the defendant recover judgment
the plaintiff will pay all costs that may be awarded to the defendant,
and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, 
not.exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking.
SEC. 4. The writ shall be directed to the marshal, and require him 
to attach and safely keep all the property of the defendant within this
District not exempt from execution, or so much thereof as may be
sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's demand, the amount of which shall
be stated in conformity with the complaint, together with costs and 
expenses.
SEC. 5. The return day of the attachment, when issued at the com­ 
mencement of the action, shall be the same as that of the summons;
when issued afterwards, it shall be twenty days after it is issued. 
SEC. 6. The rights or shares which the defendant may have in the
stock of any corporation or company, together with the interest or
profits thereon, all debts due such defendant, and all other property,
real or personal, in this District, of such defendant, not exempt from
execution, may be attached, and, if judgment be recovered against 
him, be sold or collected to satisfy the judgment and execution.
SEC. 1. The marshal to whom the writ is directed and delivered 
shall execute the same without delay, as follows : 
1. Real property shall be attached by leaving with the occupant
thereof, or, if there be no occupant, in a conspicuousplace thereon, a
copy of the writ and affidavit, certified by the marshal. 
2. Personal property capable of manual delivery to the mashal
shall be attached by taking it into custody. 
3. Stock or shares, or interest in stock or shares of any corpora­
tion or company, shall be attached by leaving with the president or 
other head of the same, or the secretary, cashier, or managing agent
thereof, a copy of the writ and affidavit, and a notice that the stock 
or interest of the defendant is attached in pursuance of such writ.
4. Debts and credits, and other personal property not capable of 
manual delivery, shall be attached by leaving with the person
owing such debts, or having in his possession or under his control
such credits or other personal property, a copy of the writ and affi­
davit, and a notice that the debts owing by him to the defendant,
or the credits and other personal property in his possession or under 
his control belonging to the defendant, are attached in pursuance of
such writ. 
SEC. 8. The marshal shall note on the writ of attachment the day,
month, and year when the attachment was made, and shall make a 
full inventory of the property attached, and return the same with the
writ. 
SEC. 9. If real estate be attached by virtue of any writ of attach­
ment, the marshal shall make a certified copy of said writ and of his 
return thereon, and deliver it within three days from the time of
making such attachment to the recorder, who shall file and record 
the same in a book to be kept for that purpose in the recorder's office.
When so filed within three days, the same shall be and continue a
lien from the time of making the attachment, otherwise it shall be
and continue a lien from)he time it is filed, on the real estate men­ 
tioned or described in the return of the marshal, until the same shall
be discharged. When the said lien shall be discharged by order of
the court, or by satisfaction of the judgment rendered in the suit, it
shall be the duty of the recorder, when requested, to record the satis­
faction piece, or transcript of the record of such order, in the book
kept for recording such liens; and he shall enter on the margin of
the page or pages where the said writ and return are so recorded, a 
minute of such discharge or satisfaction. 
SEC. 10. All persons having in their possession or under their con­
trol any credits or other personal property belonging to the defend­ 
ant, or owing any debts to the defendant at the time of service upon
them of a copy of the writ, affidavit, and notice, as provided in section 
seven of this chapter, shall, unless such property be delivered up or
transferred, or such debts be paid to the marshal, be liable to the 
plaintiff for the amount of such credits, property, or debts, until the
attachment be discharged, or any judgment recovered by him be satis­
fied; but where property is attached in the hands of a consignee,
his lien thereon shall not be affected by the attachment. 
SEC. 11. When the marshal, with a writ of attachment against the
defendant, shall apply to any person mentioned in the third and 
fourth subdivisions of section seven of this chapter, for the purpose of
attaching the property mentioned therein, such person shall furnish 
him with a certificate designating the number of shares of the de­
fendant in the stock of the corporation or company, with any dividend
or encumbrance thereon, or the amount and description of the pro­
perty or credits held by such corporation, company, or person for the
defendant, or the debt owing to the defendant. If such person refuse 
to do so, or if his certificate or statement be unsatisfactory to the
plaintiff, he may be required, by an order of the court, or of any judge 
thereof, to attend before the court or judge, and be examined on oath
concerning the same, as hereinafter prescribed in this chapter; and 
disobedience to the order may be punished as a contempt. 
SEC. 12. If any of the property attached be perishable, the marshal
shall sell the same in the manner in which such property is sold on 
execution. The proceeds thereof, and other property attached, shall
be retained by him to answer any judgment that may be recovered in 
the action, unless it be delivered over as prescribed in the next sec­
tion, or unless sooner subjected to execution upon another judgment
recovered previous to the issuing of the writ of attachment. Debts
and credits attached may be collected by the marshal, if the same can
be done without suit. The marshal's receipt shall be a sufficient 
discharge for the amount paid. 
SEC. 13. The marshal may deliver any of the property attached, to 
the defendant, or to any other person claiming it, and in whose pos­
session it was attached, upon his giving a written undertaking there­
for, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, engaging to redeliver 
it, or pay the value thereof, to be ascertained by appraisement, to any
marshal to whom execution upon a judgment obtained by the plaintiff 
in that action may be issued. If an action be brought upon such
undertaking against the principal or his sureties, it shall be a defence
that the property for which the undertaking was given did not, at the 
execution of the writ of attachment, belong to the defendant against
whom it was issued. 
SEc. 14. If any personal property attached be claimed by a third
person as his property, the marshal may summon a jury to try the 
validity of such claim, and the same proceedings shall be had thereon,
with the like effect, as in case of seizure upon execution. 
SEC. 15. Whenever the marshal, with a writ of attachment against
the defendant, shall apply to any person mentioned in section seven 
of this chapter, for the purpose of attaching the personal property
therein mentioned, and such person shall deny that he has any per­ 
sonal property of the defendant, or shall refuse to give the certificate
required in section eleven of this chapter, or if such certificate be 
unsatisfactory to the plaintiff, he may be required, by an order of the
court, or of any judge thereof, to attend before such court or judge 
at a time therein stated, not less than ten days thereafter, and be
examined on oath concerning the same. 
SEc. 16. At any time after the allowance of such order, and before
such person shall be required to attend, the plaintiff may exhibit 
written allegations and interrogatories touching the property, stock, 
or credits of the defendant, in the possession of, or held by such person 
as garnishee, or debts owing to the defendant by him; and such gar­
nishee shall be required to make full, direct, and true answers to the
same on oath. 
SEC. 11. On the day when the garnishee, duly summoned, shall be
required to attend before the court or judge, he shall exhibit on oath
his answers to the allegations and interrogatories of the plaintiff, un­
less for good cause shown a further time shall be allowed; in default
of such answer, such matters may be taken for confessed, or the court
or judge may, upon motion, compel him to answer by attachment of 
his body. 
SEC. 18. No final judgment, however, shall be rendered against the
garnishee, until the action against the defendant in attachment is
determined; and in no case for a greater amount than that sworn to 
by the plaintiff, with interest and costs. 
SEC. 19. The plaintiff may except to the answer of any garnishee
for insufficiency, and if the same shall be adjudged insufficient, the
court or judge may allow the garnishee to a.mend his answer, in such
time and on such terms as may be just, or the plaintiff may take as
confessed the allegations not denied by such answer, or move the
court or judge to attach the body of the garnishee to compel a sufficient
answer. 
SEC. 20. The plaintiff may deny the answer of the garnishee in
whole or in part, and the issues shall be tried as ordinary issues 
between plaintiff and defendant. If the answer be not excepted to,
or denied in such time as the court or judge may deem proper, it shall
be taken to be true and sufficient. 
SEC. 21. If by the answer not excepted to, nor denied, or if upon
trial it shall appear that the garnishee is possessed of property or
effects of the defendant, or is indebted to the defendant, the value of
such property or effects or of the debt being ascertained, judgment 
may be rendered against the garnishee for the proper amount in
money, and in such case the court may make him a reasonable allow­
ance for his trouble in answering, to be paid out of the funds confessed
in his hands. 
SEC. 22. Whenever any property, effects, money, or debts belonging
or owing to the defendant shall be confessed or found by the court, 
judge, or jury to be in the possession of the garnishee, he may at any
time before final judgment discharge himself dy delivering the same
to the marshal. 
SEC. 23. Debts not yet due to the defendant may be attached, but
no execution shall be awarded against the garnishee for such debts
until they shall become due. 
SEc. 24. In all cases of controversy between the plaintiff and gar­
nishee, the parties may be adjudged to pay or recover costs in the
discretion of the court. 
SEC. 25. The defendant or claimant may be required to attend before
the court, judge, or jury, for the purpose of giving any necessary or
proper information respecting the property attached, and may be
thereupon examined on oath concerning the same. 
SEc. 26. If judgment be recovered by the plaintiff against the

property sold by him, or of any debts or credits collected by him, or
so much as shall be necessary to satisfy the judgment. 
2. If any balance remain due, and an execution shall have been
issued on the judgment, he shall sell under the execution so much
of the property, real or personal, as may be necessary to satisfy the
balance, if enough for that purpose remain in his hands ; and in case
of the sale of any rights or shares in the stock of a corporation or
company, the marshal shall execute to the purchaser a certificate of
the sale, and the purchaser shall thereupon have all the rights and
privileges in respect thereto which were had by the defendant.

other cases of sales on execution. 
SEC. 27. If after selling all the property attached by him remaining
in his hands, and applying the proceeds, together with the proceeds 
of any debts or credits collected by him, deducting his fees, to the
payment of the judgment and costs, any balance shall remain due, the
marshal shall proceed to collect such balance as upon an execution in
other cases. Whenever the judgment and all costs of the proceedings 
shall have been paid, the marshal, upon reasonable demand, shall
deliver over to the defendant the residue of the attached property
remaining in his hands, and any proceeds of the property attached
une.pplied on the judgment. 
SEC. 28. If the defendant recover judgment against the plaintiff,

remaining in the marshal's hands, shall be released from the attach­
ment and delivered to the defendant.

court or judge, an undertaking, executed by at least two sureties ap- 
proved by the court or judge, to the effect that the sureties will, on
demand, pay to the plaintiff the amount of the judgment that may
be recovered against tho defendant in the action, not exceeding the
sum specified in the undertaking, which shall be sufficient to satisfy
the amount claimed by the plaintiff in his complaint, and the costs.
The sureties may be required to justify, on application to the court
or judge, and the property attached shall not be released from the 
attachment without their so justifying, if it be required.
SEC. 31. The defendant may also, at any time before the time for 
answering expires, apply, on motion, upon reasonable notice to the
plaintiff, to the court or judge, to discharge the attachment, on the
ground that the writ was improperly issued. If the motion be made
upon affidavit, on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the
plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other evidence, in ad­
dition to those on which the writ of attachment was issued. If upon
such application it shall satisfactorily appear that such writ was
improperly issued, it shall be discharged. 
SEC. 32. When the writ of attachment shall be fully executed or
discharged, the marshal shall return the same, with his proceedings 
thereon.
SEC. 33. Where a debtor has departed from this District with intent 
to defraud his creditors, or has assigned, secreted, removed, or dis­
posed of, or is about to assign, secrete, remove, or dispose of, his
property not exempt from execution, with intent to defraud his credit­
ors, a creditor may bring an action on his claim before it is due, and 
have an attachment against the property of the debtor.

be granted by the court or by the judge thereof; but before such action
shall be brought, or such attachment shall be granted, the plaintiff,
or some other person in his behalf, shall make an affidavit showing
the nature and amount of the plaintiff's claim, that it is just, when
the same will become due, and the existence of some one of the grounds
for attachment mentioned in the preceding section. The order of the
court or judge granting the attachment shall specify the amount for
which it is allowed, not exceeding a sum sufficient to satisfy the
plaintiff's claim and the probable costs of the action. The attach­
ment shall not be issued by the clerk until the plaintiff has executed
the undertaking required by section three of this chapter. In such 
action the plaintiff shall not have judgment on hie claim before it
becomes due. The proceedings shall be as in other cases of attach­
ment, except as otherwise provided.

moned, who have appeared and not been excused, and deposit them 
in a box. He shall then draw from the box names sufficient in num­
ber to constitute the jury. If the ballots become exhausted before the
jury is complete, the marshal shall summon, under the direction of
the court, from citizens of this District, and not from bystanders, so 
many qualified persons as may be necessary to complete the jury.
The jury shall consist of twelve persons, unless the parties consent to 
a less number. The parties may consent to any number not less than
three, and such consent shall be entered by the clerk on the minutes
of the trial. The parties may agree upon the jurors to compose a
special jury, and notify the court thereof, and the court shall there­
upon direct the clerk to empannel such special jury, if it can be done 
without unreasonable delay of the cause.
SEC. 2. Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are 
several parties on either side, they shall join in a challenge before it
can be made. The challenges shall be to individual jurors, and shall 
be peremptory, or for cause. Each party shall be entitled to three
peremptory challenges. 
SEC. 3. Challenges for cause may be taken on one or more of the
following grounds : 
1. A want of the q ualiflcations prescribed by statute to render a
person competent as a juror. 
2. Consanguinity or affinity within the third degree to either party.
3. Standing in the relation of guardian and ward, master and ser­ 
vant, employer and clerk, or principal and agent to either party, or
being a member of the family of either party, or being security on
any undertaking or obligation in the cause for either party. 
4. Having served as a juror or been a witness on a previous trial
between the same parties for the same cause of action. 
5. Interest on the part of the juror in the event of the action, or in
the main question involved in the action. 
6. Having ·formed or expressed an unqualified opinion or belief as
to the merits of the action.

against either party. 
SEC. 4. Challenges for cause shall be tried by the court. The juror
challenged, and any other person, may be examined as a witness on
the trial of the challenge. 
SEC. 5. As soon as the jury is completed, an oath or affirmation
shall be administered to the jurors, in substance, that they and each
of them will well and truly try the matter in issue between the 
plaintiff and defendant, and a true verdict give, according to the
evidence. 
SEC. 6. When the jury is completed and sworn, the ballots con­
taining the names of the jurors sworn shall be laid aside till the 
jury so sworn is discharged, and then they shall be returned to the
box ; and every ballot drawn containing the name of a juror not so
sworn shall be returned to the box as soon as the jury is completed. 
SEC. 7. When the jury bas been sworn, the trial shall proceed in
the following order, unless the court for special reasons otherwise 
direct : 
1. The plaintiff must briefly state his claim, and may briefly state
the evidence by which he expects to sustain it. 
2. The defendant must then briefly state his defence, and may
briefly state the evidence he expects to offer in support of it. 
3. The party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on
either side, must first produce his evidence; the adverse party will 
then produce his evidence.
4. The parties shall then be confined to rebutting evidence, unless 
the court for good reasons in furtherance of justice permits them to 
offer evidence in their original case.
5. When the evidence is concluded, either party may request 
instructions to the jury oa points of law, which shall be given or
refused by the court; which instructions shall be reduced to wi:iting, 
if either party require it. 
6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to the jury. In
the argument, the party required first to produce his evidence, shall 
have the opening and conclusion, but shall disclose in the opening all
the points relied on in the cause; and if in the closing he refer to any
new point or fact not disclosed in the opening, the adverse party shall
have the right of replying thereto, which reply shall close the argu­ 
ment in the case. 
SEC. 8. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is proper for the
jury to have a view of the property which is the subject of litigation, 
or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order them
to be conducted, in a body, under the charge of an officer, to the place,
which shall be shown to them by some person appointed by the court
for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person other 
than the person so appointed shall speak to them on any subject
connected with the trial. 
SEC. 9. When the case is finally submitted to the jury, they may
decide in court, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they shall 
be kept together in a room provided for them, or some other conve­
nient place, under the charge of an officer, until they agree upon a 
verdict, or are discharged by the court. The officer having them
under his charge shall not suffer any communication to be made to 
to them, or make any himself, except to ask them if they have
agreed upon their verdict ; and he shall not, before their verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, 
or the verdict agreed upon. 
SEC. 10. The jurors may, in the discretion of the court, at any
time before the submission of the case to them, be permitted to 
separate, or may be kept together in charge of a proper officer; in
either case they may be admonished by the court that it is their duty 
not to converse with, or suffer themselves to be addressed by, any
other person, on any subject connected with the trial, and that it ia
their duty not to form or expruss an opinion thereon until the case is
finally submitted to them. 
SEC. 11. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a
disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if
they desire to be informed as to any part of the law arising in the 
case, they may request the officer to conduct them to the court, where
the information upon the point of law shall be given, and the court 
may give its recollection as to the testimony on the point in dispute,
in the presence of or after notice to the parties or their counsel. 
SEC. 12. If after the empa.nneling of the jury, and before a verdict,
a juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his dnty, the court 
may order him to be discharged. In that case, unless the parties
agree to proceed with the other jurors, o. new juror may be sworn,
and the trial begin anew ; or the jury may be discharged and a new 
jury then or afterwards empanneled. The jury may be discharged by
the court on account of any other accident or calamity requiring their 
discharge, or by consent of both parties, or after they ho.ve been kept
together until it satisfactorily appears that there is no probability of 
their agreeing.
SEC. 13. Upon retiring for deliberation, .the jury may take with 
them the pleadings in the cause, and all papers (except depositions)
which have been received as evidence on the trial, or copies of such 
parts of public records or private documents given in evidence as
ought not, in the opinion of the court, to be taken from the person
having them in possession. They may also take with them notes of 
the testimony, or other proceedings on the trial, taken by themselves,
or any of them, but none taken by any other person, except by con­ 
sent of the parties.
SEC. 14. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict, they must 
be conducted into court by the officer having them in charge, their
names called by the clerk, and the verdict rendered by their foreman.
When the verdict is announced, either party may require the jury to
be polled. If any juror dissent from the verdict, the jury shall be 
again sent out to deliberate. 
SEc. 15. The verdict shall be written, signed by the foreman, and
read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry made, whether it is their
verdict. If any juror disagree, the jury must be sent out again; but
if no disagreement be expressed, the verdict is complete, and the jury
is discharged from the case. If, however, the verdict be defectiee in
form only, the same may, with the assent of the jury before they are
discharged, be corrected by the court. 
SEC. 16. The verdict of a jury is either general or special, A gen­
eral verdict is that by which they pronounce generally upon a.II or any. 
of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A special
verdict is that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judg­ 
ment to the court. The special verdict shall present the conclusions
of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove
them; and those conclusions of fa.ct shall be so presented as that 
nothing shall remain to the court but to draw from them conclusions
of law. 
SEC. 17. In all actions, the jury, unless otherwise directed by the
court, may, in their discretion, render a general or special verdict ; 
but the court shall, at the request of either party, direct them to find
a special verdict in writing upon all or any of the issues ; and in all
cases, when requested by either party, shall instruct them, if they
render a general verdict, to find specially upon particular questions
of fact, to be stated in writing. This special finding shall be recorded
with the verdict. 
SEC. 18. When the special :finding of facts is inconsistent with the
general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall
give judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 19. In actions for the recovery of money, the jury shall assess
the a.mount of the recovery. 
SEc. 20. In actions for the recovery of specific personal property,
the jury must assess the value of the property, as also the damages 
for the taking or detention, whenever, by their verdict, there will be
judgment for the recovery or return of the property.

be rendered does not comply therewith by the time appointed, such 
judgment shall have the same operation and effect, and be as available,
as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance had been executed con­
formably to such judgment. If the judgment be for a conveyance 
of real estate, the same shall be duly recorded in the office of the
recorder. This section shall apply to decrees rendered, or to be ren­
dered, in suits now pending.  
SEC. 7. If the taking of an account, or the proof of a fact, or the
assessment of damages, be necessary to enable the court to pronounce 
judgment upon a failure to answer, or after a decision of an issue of
law, the court may, with the assent of the party not in default, take
the account, hear the proof, or assess the damages ; or may, with the
like assent, refer the same to a referee or commissioner, or me.y direct 
the same to be ascertained or assessed by a jury.

SEC. 11. Parties to a question which might be the subject of a civil
action, may, without action, agree upon a case constituting the facts
upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission of the 
same to any court which would have jurisdiction if an action had

ordered the case to be reserved, it shall order what judgment shall be
entered. 
SEC. 16. Where, upon the statements in the pleadings, one party is 
entitled by law to judgment in his favor, judgment shall be so rendered
by the court, though a verdict has been found against such party.

the plaintiff's claim so established, judgment for the defendant shall
be given for the excess; or if it appear that the defendant is entitled
to any affirmative relief, judgment shall be given therefor.

so requiring it. If neither party require it, no such copy shall be 
made. 
SEC. 24. Satisfaction of a judgment shall be entered by the clerk in
the judgment docket, when an execution shall be returned satisfied,
or upon an acknowledgment of satisfaction filed with the clerk, made 
in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property,
by the judgment creditor, or within two years after the judgmers, by 
the attorney of record, unless a revocation of his authority be pre­
viously filed. Whenever a judgment shall be satisfied in fact, other­ 
wise than upon an execution, it shall be the duty of the party or
attorney to give such acknowledgment, and upon motion the court 
may compel it, or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made
without it. 
SEC. 25. Such judgment docket shall be a record, and open, during
the usual hours of transacting business, to the examination of any
person desiring it. 
SEc. 26. Before rendering judgment against a defendant construe·
tively summoned, and who has not appeared, the court may cause the
plaintiff to appear personally in court, or before a commissioner, and
answer under oath interrogatories concerning the matters in the com­
plaint, or any matters which might be set up in defence thereto,
including matters of set-off and counter-claim, and may order the 
examination to be reduced to writing, and filed with the papers in the
action. If, upon the examination, any matters of set-off or counter­
claim are disclosed, the same may be adjusted by the judgment.

this chapter.
SEC. 2. After the lapse of five years from the entry of the judgment, 
an execution can be issued only on leave of the court upon motion,
after ten days' personal notice to the adverse party, unless he be 
absent, or non-resident, or cannot be found,' when service of notice
may be made by publication as in an original action. Such leave 
shall not be given, unless it be established by the oath of the party,
or other satisfactory proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, 
remains unsatisfied and due.
SEC. 3. When a judgment requires the payment of money, or 
delivery of real or personal property, the same may be enforced in
those respects by execution, as provided in this chapter. When it
requires the performance of any other act, a certified copy of the 
judgment may be served on the party against whom it is given, or
upon the person or officer who is required thereby, or by law, to
obey the same, and his obedience thereto enforced; if he refuse, he 
may be punished by the court, as for contempt.

body of a judgment debtor, except where it is so expressly provided
by law. 
SEC. 7. The execution shall be issued by the clerk in the name of
the United States, sealed with the seal of the court, and shall be 
directed to the marshal. It shall intelligibly refer to the judgment, 
stating the court where and the time when rendered) the names of
the parties, the amount of the judgment, if it be for money, and the
amount actually due thereon, and shall require the marshal, sub­ 
stantially, as follows :
1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it shall 
require the marshal to satisfy the judgment out of the property of the
debtor subject to execution. All property, real, and personal, of the
judgment debtor, not exempt by law, shall be liable to execution. 
2. If it be against real or personal property in the hands of personal
representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real property, or
trustees, it shall require the marshal to satisfy the judgment out of
such property. 
3. If it be against the body of the judgment debtor, it shall require
the marshal to arrest such debtor, and commit him to jail until he 
shall pay the judgment, or be discharged according to law.
4. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal 
property, it shall require the marshal to deliver possession of the
same, particularly describing it, to the party entitled thereto ; and 
may, at the same time, require the marshal to satisfy any costs,
damages, or rents and profits recovered by the same judgment, out of 
the property of the party against whom it is rendered, subject to
execution; the value of the property for which the judgment was
recovered shall be specified therein, so that if a delivery thereof
cannot be had, the execution shall, in that respect, be deemed an 
execution against property.
SEC. 8. The execution shall be returnable within one hundred and 
eighty days from its date. 
SEc. 9. If it appear upon the face of an execution, or by the
endorsement of the clerk, that, of those against whom it issued, any

sold, unless the surety shall direct otherwise. 
SEC. 10. An execution may be issued and executed on Sunday,
whenever an affidavit shall be filed by the plaintiff, or some person 
in his behalf, stating he will lose his judgment, as he has reason to 
fear and believe, unless process issue on that day. The clerk shall
endorse on such execution that the defendant is not privileged from 
service on Sunday.  
SEC. 11. When judgment has been rendered against any person for
the recovery of money or sale of property, he may, by frocuring one 
or more sufficient freehold securities to enter into a recognizance,
acknowledging themselves bail for the defendant, for the payment of
the judgment, together with the interest and costs accrued and to 
accrue, have a stny of execution for one hundred and eighty days
from time of entering judgment. 
SEC. 12. The bail for stay of execution may be taken and approved
by the clerk, and the recognizance signed by the bail entered of 
record, at any time before the term of stay of execution expires. The
undertaking in the recognizance shall be for the payment of the 
judgment, interest, and costs that may accrue at or before the expira­
tion of the stay of execution. 
SEC. 13. When the bail is entered after execution issued, the clerk
shall immediately notify the marshal of the stay, who shall forthwith 
return the execution, noting his proceedings thereon.
SEc. 14. All property levied on before stay of execution, and all 
written undertakings for the delivery of personal property to the
marshal, shall be relinquished by the marshal, upon bail for the stay
of execution being entered. 
SEc. 15. Every recognizance of bail taken as above provided shall
have the effect of a judgment confessed, from the date thereof, against
property of the bail. The date of the recognize.nee and the names of
the bail shall be entered in the judgment docket. 
SEc. 16. At the expiration of the stay, it shall be the duty of the
clerk to issue a joint execution against the property of all the judg­
ment debtors and bail; but tho marshal shall first levy upon the
property of the judgment debtors, if sufficient can be found, if not,
he shall then, without delay, levy the execution upon the property of
the bail. Btit no property of the bail shall be sold when property of
the original judgment debtor subject to execution can be pointed out 
by the bail. 
SEc. 17. No stay of execution shall be allowed upon any judgment
recovered against any offlcer.person, or corporation, or the sureties
of any of them, for money received in a fiduciary capacity, or for a
breach of any official duty. 
SEC. 18. When any court shall render judgment against two or
more persons, any of whom are sureties for any other or others in the 
contract on which the judgment is founded, there shall be no stay
of execution on the judgment, if the sureties object at the time of
rendering the judgment, and it shall be so ordered by the court. 
SEC. 19. Any bail for the stay of execution may filo with the clerk
an affidavit, stating that he verily believes he will have to satisfy the 
judgment, interest, and costs thereon, unless execution issues imme­
diately; and the clerk shall thereupon issue execution forthwith,
unless other sufficient bail be entered before the clerk, as in other
cases. If other sufficient bail be entered, it shall have the force of
the original bail entered before the filing of the affidavit, and shall
discharge the original bail. 
SEC. 20. When an execution against the property of any person is
issued to the marshal, be shall proceed, without unreasonable delay, 
to levy the same upon the property, rights, credits, and effects of the
defendant subject to execution.

by any State or the United States, and circulating 88 money, may be

other evidences of debt, capable of transfer by delivery, issued by any
corporation, or company, or town, county, State, or country, may be
levied upon as personal property, and sold on execution. 
SEC. 23. Shares of stock in any corporation or company may be
levied upon and sold, when the office and books showing the shares of 
stock and stockholders of the corporation or company are kept in this
District; and the marshal shall transfer the stock, subject to the
rights of the corporation or company. The marshal shall have access 
to the books of any such corporation or company for the purpose of
making the levy, and if .refused access, the court, or any judge in
vacation, shall enforoe .the right, and may proceed against any person 
so refusing as for a contempt, The shares of stock subject to be levied
upon shall be bound by the execution from the time of the levy, and 
when such levy is made, the marshal shall leave the notice with the
officers of the corporation or company, and such levy shall constitute
u lien upon such stock from the time of such levy. 
SEC. 24. Any debt or thing in action, legally or equitably assign­
able, may be levied on, when given up by the defendant, and sold on
execution, in the same manner as other personal property. The mar­
shal making the sale of any such debt or thing in action shall assign
and deliver the same to the purchaser, and the assignment shall have
the same effect as if made by the execution defendant at the time of
making the levy thereon, and shall be treated as so made. 
SEC. 25. When any execution shall issue against the property of
any person, it shall be the duty of the marshal to levy the same first
upon that part of the property designated by such person, if there be 
no reasonable doubt that he is the owner thereof, and if designated in
time to enable the marshal to levy and sell without unnecessary delay.
If no property be thus designated, it shall be the duty of the marshal
to levy the execution upon any property of the debtor which can be 
found subject to execution. 
SEC. 26. If the property thus designated shall be insufficient to
satisfy the execution, the marshal shall levy the same upon such other 
property subject to execution as can be most readily found, sufficient,
in addition to the property designated, to satisfy the execution. 
SEC. 27. The messuage, lands or tenements of the debtor, upon
which he may reside,· shall not be levied upon if other property 
subject to execution be found sufficient to satisfy the execution in the
hands of the marshal, unless the debtor shall otherwise direct. 
SEC. 28. When personal property shall be seized by virtue of any
execution, and any person other than the defendant shall file with the 
marshal his claim thereto, verified by affidavit, the marshal shall
summon six persons, qualified as jurors, to try the validity of the 
claim; giving three days' notice of the time and place of the trial to
the plaintiff in the execution or his attorney. 
SEC. 29. The marshal, at tho request of either party, shall summon
witnesses, and compel them to attend and give testimony; and he 
shall administer the necessary oaths to the jurors and witnesses.
The verdict of such jury being rendered in writing, and signed by
the foreman, shall be a full indemnity to the marshal proceeding in
accordance therewith. 
SEC. 30. The marshal may levy the costs of such proceeding upon
the goods and chattels of the party liable to pay them, as on execution. 
SEc. 31. If at any time before the jury return, the claimant withdraw
his claim, the trial shall proceed no further, and the claimant shall
pay the costs of such unfinished trial. 
SEC. 32. Notwithstanding the verdict of the jury be for the claim­
ant, yet the marshal shall proceed to sell the property seized in 
satisfaction of the execution, if the plaintiff tender to him a written
undertaking, executed by two or more good and sufficient sureties,
residents of this District, in double the value of the property, to the
effect that he will indemnify the marshal against all damages and
costs which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure and sale of
such property, and, moreover, that he will pay to any person claim­
ing title to such property all damages which he may sustain in conse­ 
quence of such seizure and sale. If such undertaking be given, it
shall be returned by the marshal, together with the execution, and
filed with the clerk; and the claimant may prosecute his suit upon
such undertaking, and recover such damages as may be assessed. 
SEC. 33. Any personal property taken in execution may be returned
to the execution defendant by the marshal, upon the delivery by the
defendant to him of a written undertaking, payable to the execution
plaintiff, with two good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the
marshal, to the effect that the property shall be delivered t.o the mar­
shal at a time and place named in the undertaking, to be sold 
according to law. 
SEc. 34. In case of the non-delivery of tho property according to
the undertaking, it shall be the duty of the marshal to levy upon and
sell the same, or any other property of the defendant subject to execu­
tion, as soon as practicable at any time before the return day of tbe
execution. Upon the forfeiture of tho written undertaking, the mar­
shal shall forthwith return it, endorsed "forfeited," to the clerk's 
office, for the use of the plaintiff, 
SEc. 35. An action may be bad on such undertaking, rhenever the

personal property on execution shall be given for ten days successively,
by posting up a written or printed notice thereof at the place where
the sale is to be made, and also by advertising the same in some
newspaper published in this District, said advertisement to be inserted
at least three times, and the first insertion to be at least ten days

officer shall deem it expedient, and for the interest of all parties con­ 
cerned, to postpone o. sale for want of purchasers, he may postpone
it for any time not exceeding ten days, and so from time to time, for 
such cause, until the sale shall be completed, giving notice of every 
such adjournment, by a public declaration thereof, at the time and
place previously appointed for a sale, and also by an advertisement 
inserted in some newspaper of this District three days at least prior
to such adjourned sale. 
SEC. 42. If the property levied upon shall not sell for a sum 
sufficient to satisfy the execution, the marshal shall make a further
and sufficient levy, if sufficient property can be found, and proceed as 
· upon the first levy, and return his proceedings thereon. 
SEC. 43. The clerk, upon the return of an execution unsatisfied,
shall, if required, issue another execution upon the judgment, and

deliver to the purchaser a deed of conveyance for the premises, which
shall be valid and effectual to convey all the right, title, and interest
of the execution debtor to the purchaser. 
SEC. 45. In case the purchaser of any real estate upon execution,
having paid the purchase money therefor, shall die before a deed of 
conveyance shall have been executed to him, the marshal shall convey
such real estate to the heirs or deviseee of the deceased person. 
SEC. 46. Any officer selling without the notice prescribed by this chapter, shall forfeit and pay one hundred dollars to the party in­
fored, in addition to his actual damages; and a person wilfully taking 
down or defacing the notice posted, if done before sale or the satisfac­
tion of the judgment, (if the judgment be satisfied before sale,) shall 
forfeit one hundred dollars. 
SEC. 47. An omission by the marshal to give the notice of sale
required by law shall not affect the validity of any sale made to a
purchaser in good faith without notice of such omission. 
SEC. 48. Whenever the purchaser of any property sold on execution
shall fail or refuse to pay the purchase money, he shall be liable, on
motion to be made by the marshal or the execution plaintiff, in the
proper court, five days' notice being given, to a judgment for the
amount of the purchase money, and damages not exceeding ten per 
cent., and interest, with costs, and no stay of execution shall be 
allowed on the judgment ; or the marshal may re-expose and sell the
property on the same or any subsequent day according to law; and 
· if the amount bid at the second sale shall not equal the amount bid 
at the first sale and the coats of the second sale, the first purchaser
shall be liable for the deficiency, and damages thereon not exceeding
ten per cent., and interest and costs, to be recovered by a like notice
and motion as before provided. 
SEC. 49. When property shall be sold on execution for more than
will satisfy the execution, including interest and costs, the marshal
shall pay the overplus to the execution debtor of whom it was levied,
or to his assigns. - 
SEc. 50. When the marshal has sold the property of a. non-resident
or other person upon an execution issued on a judgment recovered 
against him in a case where publication is provided for, and no per­
sonal notice of the pendency of the action was given to such defendant,
the plaintiff shall not, be entitled to receive any of the proceeds of
such sale until be has filed in the clerk's office a written undertaking, 
with two sureties to be approved by the clerk, to the effect that he
will refund the money about to be received by him, or so much thereof
as shall be necessary, if the judgment shall afterwards be annulled or
set aside, and the defendant shall show the plaintiff's claim is un­
founded in whole or in part. But surety to refund shall not be 
required in cases of attachment.
SEC. 51. The death of the defendant, after the execution is placed 
in the bands of the marshal to be executed, shall not affect his pro
ceedings thereon.

ing, removing, conveying, or transferring his property subject to
execution, with intent to defraud and delay the plaintiff, or charging 
that the debtor has money, rights, credits, or effects, with which the
judgment, or some pa.rt thereof, might be paid, and which he fraudu­ 
lently withholds, or conceals, with a view to delay or defraud the
creditor. 
SEC. 53. The affidavit need not designate specifically any property,
moneys, or effects, fraudulently removed, transferred, concealed, con­ 
veyed, or withheld by the debtor, but the jury or court, in determining
the matters in issue bet ween the parties, if the :finding be for the 
creditor, shall designate, in the finding, jhe moneys, effects, property,
debt or things in action subject to execution, which have been thus
removed, concealed, transferred, conveyed, or withheld, and the value
thereof. 
SEC. 54. Upon the filing of the affidavit, the clerk shall issue a
notice requiring the debtor to appear at the next term of the court, 
and show cause why such execution should not issue against him.
After ten days' notice, or after the return of two notices of "not
found," the court shall hear and determine the matters and things
contained in the affidavit. 
SEC. 55. If the debtor shall fail to appear and show cause, the court
may hear and determine the same in the absence of the debtor, or a 
jury for that purpose may be empanneled, if desired by the creditor. 
SEC. 56. If the debtor appear, and plead to the affidavit any suffi­
cient matter to bar the issuing of the execution, and an issue be taken 
thereon, the same may be tried by the court, or a jury, as in other
cases.

which he may have, not included in the finding of the court or jury,
subject to execution, if any, together with the property, credits, and 
effects, included in the finding of the court or jury, and all his choses
in action, if any, exceeding, with other property retained, the amount
exempt by law from execution. He shall also make oath that he has
no more or other property, either real or personal, subject to execu­
tion, and that he has no money, rights, credits or effects, in his pos­
session or under his control, or in the possession or under the control 
of any other person for his use, exceeding, with other property re­
tained, the amount exempt from execution, and that he has neither
directly nor indirectly disposed of, transferred, or concealed any of
his property, rights, credits, moneys, or effects, nor confessed or suf­
fered any judgment, with intent to delay or defraud any of his 
creditors.
SEC. 63. For the purpose of enabling the defendant to take the 
oath, it shall be the duty of the marshal, upon the prisouer's request,
to take him before some person authorized to administer an oath, 
who shall reduce the oath to writing, explain it to the prisoner, and
cause him to be sworn to and subscribe it, and having certified the
oath, deliver it to the marshal, who shall make it a part of his return
by appending it to the execution. 
SEC. 64. The execution creditor shall be notified of the time and
place at which the oath will be taken; the notice shall be served upon 
the creditor, or his agent or attorney, by the marshal. When the
oath is administered, the execution creditor, his agent or attorney,
may propound to the prisoner any relevant questions touching his
property, moneys, rights, credits, and effects, and the person adminis­ 
tering the oath shall reduce the questions and answers to writing, and
forthwith file the same with the clerk. When the prisoner has strictly

therein, the discharge of the debtor, and the sale of the property, 
according to the facts, to the court.

same may be enforced by any legal proceedings.

same or a new execution against his body, or his property may be
proceeded against in the same manner as if his body had never been

to answer concerning the same ; and such proceedings may thereupon
be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor
towards the satisfaction of the judgment as are prescribed by law. 
SEC. 3. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judg­
ment debtor, as provided in the two preceding sections, the court or 
judge may, upon satisfactory proof, by affidavit of the party or other­
wise, that there is danger of the debtor leaving this District or con­ 
cealing himself to avoid said examination, issue a warrant requiring
the marshal to arrest such debtor and bring him before the court or 
judge. Upon being brought before the court or judge, he shall be
examined on oath, and other witnesses may be examined on either
side, and if on such examination it appear~ that there is danger of

or judge, that he will, from time to time, attend for examination
before the court or judge, as may be directed. 
SEC. 4. No person shall, on examination pursuant to this chapter, 
be excused from answering any question on the ground that his

SEC. 5. After the issuing of execution against property, any person 
indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the marshal the amount
of his debt, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the 
execution, and the marshal's receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for
the amount so paid or directed to be credited by the judgment creditor
on the execution. 
SEC. 6. After the issuing or return of an execution against property
of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same 
judgment, and upon proof, by affidavit or otherwise, to the satisfaction 
of the court, or any judge thereof, that any person or corporation has
property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted to him, the court or 
judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation, or any
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place, and
answer concerning the same. The court or judge may also, in their 
discretion, require notice of such proceeding to be given to any party
in the action, in such manner as may seem proper.

sureties shall be liable for the faithful discharge of hisduties as such
receiver; if any other person shall be appointed receiver, he shall 
give a written undertaking, in such sum as shall be prescribed by the
court or judge, with one or more sureties, to the effect that he will
faithfully discharge the duties of a receiver, and he shall also take an
oath to the sapie effect, before acting as such receiver. The under­
taking mentioned in this section shall be to the United States, and 
actions may be prosecuted for a breach thereof, by any person inter­
ested, in the same manner as upon the marshal's official bond. 
SEc. 12. If any person, party, or witness, disobey an order of the

therein of the parties interested. 
SEC. 3. On the filing of such petition, a summons to appear and
answer thereto shall be issued by the clerk, and served personally on
each of tho said parties, if they shall be found ; if not found, by
leaving a copy thereof at their last place of residence; or if any of 
them are non-residents of this District, or if in the petition it is
alleged that their names are unknown to the petitioner, and such non­ 
residence or want of knowledge be verified by affidavit, or if it shall
appear by affidavit, or by the return of the officer having the sum­ 
mons to serve, that the residence of such defendants is unknown, the 
court, or any judge thereof, may order notice of the pendency of such 
petition to be given at least for three weeks successively in some
newspaper published in this District .. 
SEC. 4. It appearing to the court that such summons has been
served ten days before the first day of the term, and when publication
as aforesaid is required, that the same has been made thirty days
previous to such term, the court shall proceed to hear such petition.
Any person interested in such estate may appear and show why the 
petitioner ought not to have partition as prayed for; and the further
pleadings shall be conducted, and the issues joined shall be determined 
as in other cases.
SEC. 5. If any person not named in the petition shall appear and 
plead as a defendant, or allege any title to any part of the premises,
the petitioner may reply that such person has no estate in the premises, 
e.nd also any other matter in like manner as if he had not disputed
such person's right to appear. If it shall appear that such person
has no estate in the lands, the matter of his objection to the partition
shall be no further inquired of. 
SEC. 6. If, upon trial, or upon default, or otherwise, it shall appear
that partition ought to be me.de, the court shall make an order that 
partition be made to the parties who may desire the same, specifying
therein 'the share assigned to each, and taking into consideration the
advancements to heirs of a. person dying intestate ; and the residue
of the premises shall remain for the persons entitled thereto, subject 
to a future partition.

estate contrary to the intention of a testator expressed in his will.
SEC. 8. Upon an order for partition, the court shall appoint three

sioners, who shall make partition of such lands in pursuance of the
order of the court.

any of their duties, but the acts of a majority of them shall be valid.
Vacancies shall be filled by the court, or by a judge ir; vacation.

for their wards as their wards might have acted being of age. The
guardian of an infant, and the person entitled to the custody and 
management of the estate of an insane person, or other person
adjudged incapable of conducting his own affairs, may consent to a
partition without any proceeding by petition as aforesaid, and agree
upon the share to be set off to such infant or other person entitled, 
and may execute a release in his behalf to the owners of the shares,
of the parts to which they may be respectively entitled, upon an order 
of the court to that effect.
SEC. 14. The commissioners shall make a return of their proceed­ 
ings, under their hands and seals, together with their warrant, to the
court, specifying by divisions, or by metes and bounds, each share,
whenever partition is made. They shall also report the value of the
whole and of each share. If their proceedings are confirmed by the
court, judgment shall thereupon be rendered that the said partition 
be firm and effectual forever ; and the return shall then be recorded
in the clerk's office, and also in the office of the recorder. 
SEC. 15. The court may, for any sufficient reason, set aside the
return and commit the duty of partition anew to the same, or other 
commissioners, to be appointed and qualified as aforesaid, whereupon
the same proceedings shall be had as before directed. 
SEC. 16. Any person having a mortgage, attachment, or other lien
on the share of any part owner, shall be concluded by the judgment 
of the court, so far as it respects the partition and assignment of tho
shares, but his lien shall remain in full force upon the part that shall
be assigned to or left for such part owner. 
SEC. 17. In all cases of petition for a partition of real estate, the
widow entitled to dower therein, if any there be, shall be made a
party to the proceedings, unless dower shall have been previously 
assigned. And whenever a widow is entitled to dower in real estate,
of which partition is demanded, the commissioners me.king partition
shall set off to such widow her dower therein. 
SEc. 18. When such commissioners shall report to the court that
the whole or part of the lands of which partition is demanded cannot 
be divided without damage to the owners, the court, in its discretion,
may order the whole or such part of the premises to be sold at public 
or private sale on such terms and conditions as it may prescribe.
And if a part only be sold, the remainder may be partitioned, subject 
to the rules provided in this chapter. If, under such partial partition,

with the owner of any building, or with the agent of such owner, 
perform any labor upon, or furnish any materials, engine, or machinery
for the construction or repairing of such building, shall, upon filing
the notice prescribed in the next following section, have a lien upon
such building, and the lot of ground upon which the same is situated,
:for such labor done or materials, engine, or machinery furnished, when
the amount shall exceed twenty dollars. 
SEC. 2. Any person wishing to avail himself of the provisions of this chapter, .whether his claim be due or not, shall file in the recorder's 
office, at any time within three months after the completion of such
building or repairs, a notice of hie intention to hold a lien upon the 
property declared by this chapter liable to such lien, for the amount
due or to become due to him, specifically setting forth the amount
claimed. Upon hie failure to do so, the lien shall be lost. The recorder
shall file and record such notice .in a book provided for that purpose.

after the completion of the building or repairs, unless before that time
an action to enforce the same shall have been commenced in the circuit
court by the person having such lien against the owner with whom, 
or with whose agent, the contract was made, unless such claim be not
due at the expiration of one year after such completion, in which case 
the action shall be commenced within three months after the same
shall have become due. 
SEC. 4. The complaint of the plaintiff' shall contain a brief state­
ment of the contract on which the claim is founded, the amount due

to the person in possession of the premises. If the defendant shall
have sold or disposed of the premises before the service of the sum­
mons, the court shall direct notice of the proceedings to be served on
the purchaser or his agent for the premises, who may thereupon, if 
he desire it, be made a party defendant in the action. 
SEC. 6. The proceedings in an action to enforce such lien shall be
the same as in other actions, except as otherwise provided in this chapter; and if judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, he may have
execution issued against the premises, and thereupon the marshal
shall proceed as upon other executions against real property. 
SEc. 7. The liens created in pursuance of the provisions of this chapter shall have precedence 'over all other liens or encumbrances
which attached upon the premises subsequent to the time at which
the building was commenced, or the materials were furnished. If,
upon a sale of the premises on execution, the proceeds be insufficient
to pay all such liens, the court shall order them to be paid in propor­
tion to the amount respectively due to each, and any other property
of the defendant not exempt from execution may be sold to satisfy 
such execution.

of such building shall have been the property of the person contracting
for the erection or repair of the same. If the building be in Wash­ 
ington City or Georgetown, the ground on which the same is erected,

ing to the depth of the lot or lots on which it is erected, shall also be

SEC. 9. All or any number of persons having liens on the same
building pursuant to the provision, of this chapter, may join in one

respectively entitled. If several such actions be brought by different 
claimants, and be pending at the same time, the court may order
them to be consolidated. 
SEc. 10. Whenever any person having a lien by virtue of the pro­
visions of this chapter shall have received satisfaction for his claim, 
and the costs of his proceedings thereon, he shall, upon the request
of any person interested, and upon the payment or tender of the costs 
of entering satisfaction, within six days after such payment or tender,
enter satisfaction of his demand in the office of the recorder, and upon 
failure to do so he shall forfeit fifty dollars to the party aggrieved,
and all damages which he may have sustained in consequence of such
failure or neglect. 
SEC. 11. Any sub-contractor, journeyman, or laborer employed in
the construction or repairing of any building, or in furnishing any 
materials or machinery for the same, may give the owner thereof
notice in writing, particularly setting forth the amount of his claim, 
and the service rendered, for which his employer is indebted to him,
and that he holds the owner responsible for the same ; and the owner
of the building shall be liable for such claim, but not to exceed the
amount due from him to the employer at the time of notice, or subse­
quently, which may be recovered in an action. 
SEC. 12. Whenever any sub-contractor, journeyman, or laborer
shall recover any such claim from the owner of the building, the same 
may be set off by such owner in any action brought against him by
the person who otherwise would be entitled to recover the same under 
the contract.
SEc. 13. In all proceedings commenced under this chapter, the 
defendant may file a written undertaking, with surety to be approved
by the court, to the effect that he will pay the judgment that may 
be recovered, and costs, and thereby release his property from the

action for obeying any writ of habeas corpus, or order of discharge

some irreparable injury before compliance with the writ can be en·
forced, such court or judge may cause a warrant to be issued, reciting
the facts and directed to the marshal or any constable, commanding

expected from the witness, and its materiality. While a prisoner's
deposition is being taken, he shall remain in the custody of the officer 
having him in charge, who shall afford reasonable facilities for taking
such deposision. 
SEC. 21. The testimony of witnesses may be taken in three modes:
1. By affidavit, or a written declaration under oath, made without 
notice to the adverse party.
2. By a deposition, or a written declaration under oath, taken upon 
notice to the adverse party for the purpose of enabling him to attend 
and cross-examine, or upon written interrogatories.
3. By oral examination, or an examination in the presence of the 
jury or tribunal which is to decide the fact, or act upon it, the testimony
being heard by the jury or tribunal from the lips of the witness. 
SEC. 22. An affidavit may be used to verify a pleading, to prove 
the service of a summons, notice, or other process in an action to 
obtain a provisional remedy, an examination of a witness, a stay of 
proceedings, or upon a motion, and in any other case permitted by
law. 
SEC. 23. An affidavit may be made in and out of this District before
any person authorized to take depositions, and must be authenticat.ed
in the same way, except that in case of an affidavit for the verificanon
of a pleading made beyond the District, the certificate of such officer, 
signed officially by him, shall be evidence that the affidavit was duly 
made, and that he was such officer.
SEc. 24. The deposition of any witness may be used only in the 
following cases :
1. When the witness is beyond the reach of the prcoess of the 
court.
2. When from age, infirmity, or imprisonment, the witness is 
unable to attend court, or is dead.
3. When the deposition has been taken by the agreement of parties. 
SEc. 25. Either party may commence taking testimony by de}'O" 
sitions as hereinafter provided, at any time after service of summons
upon the defendant; but when it is offered to read the same in 
evidence, a sufficient cause therefor must appear to the satisfaction
of the court. 
SEC. 26. Depositions may be. taken in this District before any judge
of the circuit court, the judge of the criminal or orphans' court, or
any clerk or register thereof, before a justice of the peace, notary 
public, mayor of the city of Washington, or of Georgetown, or before
a commissioner, or any person specially empowered. 
SEC. 27. Depositions may be taken out of this District by a judge,
justice, or chancellor of any court of record, a justice of the peace, 
notary public, mayor or chief magistrate of any city or a town
corporate, a commissioner appointed by the President of the United 
States, or any of the circuit courts of the United States, to take
depositions, or any person specially authorized by a commission from 
the clerk of the circuit court of this District.
SEc. 28. The officer before whom depositions are taken must not be 
a relative or attorney of either party,· or otherwise interested in the
result of the action or proceeding. 
SEC. 29. When a deposition is to be taken within this District, no
commission shall be necessary for taking the same. When taken out 
of the District, the clerk of the circuit court shall, upon the request
of a party taking the deposition, issue a commission therefor generally, 
or to the officer or commissioner designated; and no affidavit or order
of the court shall be necessary to authorize the issuing of such com­
mission. 
SEC. 30. Prior to the taking of any deposition, unless taken under
a special agreement, a written notice, specifying the action or pro, 
ceeding, the name of the court or tribunal in which it is to be used,
and the time and place of taking the same, shall be served upon the 
adverse party, his a.gent or attorney of record, or left at his usual
place of abode. The notice shall be served so as to allow the 
adverse party sufficient time to attend by the usual route of travel,
and one day for preparation, exclusive of Sundays and the day of 
notice; and the examination may, if so stated in the notice, be
adjourned from day to day. .  
SEC. 31. The notice may be served in the same manner and by any
person, other than a party, authorized to serve a subpoena for witness. 
When the party against whom the deposition is to be used is absent
from or a non-resident of the District, and has no agent or attorney
of record therein, he me.y be notified of the taking of the deposition 
by publication. The publication must be made three consecutive
weeks in some newspaper of general circulation printed within the
District, and must contain all that is required in a written notice. 
The same may be proved as required in the manner prescribed in
section sixty-five of this chapter. 
SEC. 32. The deposition shall be written down by the officer, or the
deponent, or some disinterested person, in the presence and under the
direction of the officer, and after the same has been carefully read to 
or by the deponent, it shall be subscribed by him. 
SEC. 33. The officer taking the deposition shall annex a certificate
thereto stating the following facts : 
1. That the deponent was sworn according to law.
2. By whom the deposition was written ; and, if written by the 
deponent, or some disinterested person, that it was written in the
presence and under the direction of the officer. 
3. That the deposition was read to or by the deponent, and signed
by him. 
4. The time and place of taking the deposition.
SEC. 34. The officer taking the deposition shall sign the certificate, 
giving his title, and if he have a. seal of office, shall affix the same
thereto. He shall then seal up the deposition, endorse on the envelope 
the title of the cause, and address and transmit the same to the clerk
of the court where the action or proceeding is pending, or to such
other tribunal or person as hereinafter provided in section thirty-nine
of this chapter. 
SEC. 35. Depositions taken pursuant to this chapter, by any judicial
or other officer herein authorized to take the same, having a seal of 
office, shall be admitted in evidence upon the certificate and signature
of such officer under the seal of the court of which he is an officer, or
his official seal, and no other or further act of authentication shall be
necessary. If the officer ta.king the same have no official seal, the 
deposition, if not taken in this District, shall be certified and signed
by him, and shall be further authenticated either by parol proof 
adduced in court, or by the official certificate and seal of any secretary
or other officer of state keeping the great seal thereof, or of the clerk 
or prothonotary of any court having a seal, attesting that such judi­
cial or other officer was at the time of taking the deposition authorized
to take the same, within the meaning of this chapter. But if the
deposition be taken within this District by an officer having no seal,
or within or without this District under e. special commission, it shall 
be sufficiently authenticated by the official signature of the officer or
commissioner taking the same. 
SEC. 36. Depositions, after being filed, may be published by the
clerk at the request of either party, after giving to the other, his agent
or attorney, reasonable notice of the time thereof, or they may be
published by order of the court, on the motion of either party. 
SEC. 37. Every deposition intended to be read in evidence must be
filed in court at least one day before the time at which the cause in
which the same is to be used, stands on the docket for trial; or if filed 
afterwards and claimed to be used on the trial, the adverse party shall
be entitled to a continuance in the discretion of the court. 
SEC. 38. When an action has been dismissed and another instituted
for the same cause, depositions ta.ken in the first action may, subject
to all proper exceptions, be used in the second or other action between
the same parties or their representatives, if it appear that the same
were duly filed in the court when the previous cause was pending, and 
have remained on file since.
SEC. 39. Depositions taken pursuant to this chapter may be used as 
provided in section twenty-four, on the trial of any civil action or
proceeding pending before any justice of the peace or before any
arbitrator or referee, and the same shall be sealed up and endorsed as
before prescribed, and be addressed and transmitted by the officer
taking them to such justice of the peace, arbitrator, or referee. 
SEc. 40. Every person authorized to take depositions shall receive
for reducing the same to writing, one dollar for every hour he shall
be so engaged, not to exceed five dollars a day. For all other services
attending the execution of the same, he shall be entitled to such fees 
as are allowed to a justice of the peace for like services. Witnesses
attending before him shall be each entitled to one dollar per day. He
may retain the depositions until his fees and charges are paid. He 
shall also tax the costs of the marshal or other party who shall serve
the process aforesaid, and fees of the witnesses, and may, if directed
by the persons entitled thereto, retain the depositions until such fees
are paid. 
SEC. 41. Objections to the competency of a deponent, or to the
propriety of any question put to him, or answer given by him, may 
be made at the time of taking his deposition, or afterwards in coo.rt,
whether made at the time of taking the deposition or not. 
SEC. 42. No exception other than for incompetency or irrelenncy
shall be regarded unless made and filed before the commencement
of the trial. But any deposition may, after the commencement, be
suppressed, if any matter which is not disclosed in the deposition
appears sufficient to authorize such suppression. 
SEC. 43. Such exceptions shall be in writing, specifying the grounds
of objection, and filed with the papers in the case, and the court shall,
on the motion of either party, hear and determine the questions
arising thereon before the commencement of the trial. 
SEC. 44. Whenever any testimony taken under a oomtmssron ii
suppressed, or the commission, on return thereof, set aside for any
irregularity or omission in the commission, or proceedings under it,
the court or tribunal, or officer before whom the cause is pending,
may, in his or its discretion, continue the same. 
SEC. 45. The testimony of witnesses may be perpetuated in the
following manner : 
SEC. 46. The applicant shall file in the office of the clerk of the
circuit court a petition, to be verified, in which he shall set forth
specially the subject-matter relative to which the testimony is to be
taken and the names of the persons interested, if known to the appli­
cant; and if not known, such general description as he cau give of
them, as heirs, devisees, alienees, or otherwise. The petition shall
also state the names of the witnesses to be examined, and the inter­
rogatories to be propounded to each ; that the applicant expects to be
a party to an action in a court of this District, in which such testimony
will, as he believes, be material, aud the obstacles preventing the
immediate commencement of the action, when the applicant expects 
to be the plaintiff. 
SEc. 47. The court, or, in vacation, a judge thereof, may forthwith
make an order allowing the examination of such witnesses. The 
order shall prescribe the time and place of the examination, how
long and the manner in which the parties interested shall be notified 
thereof. 
SEC. 48. When it appears satisfactorily to the court or judge that
the parties interested cannot be personally notified: such court or 
judge shall appoint a competent attorney to examine the petition, and
prepare and file cross-interrogatories to those contained therein. The
witnesses shall be examined upon the interrogatories of the appli­ 
cant, and upon cross-interrogatories, when they are required to be
prepared, and no others shall be propounded to them ; nor shall any 
statement be received which is not responsive to some one of them.
The attorney filing the cross-interrogatories shall be allowed a rea­ 
sonable fee therefor, to be taxed in the bill of costs.
SEC. 49. Such depositions shall be taken before some one authorized 
by law to take depositions, or before some one specially authorized by
the court or judge, and shall be returned to the office of the clerk of
the circuit court, certified in the manner hereinbefore prescribed. 
SEC. 50. The court or judge, if satisfied that the depositions have
been properly taken, shall approve the same and order them to be filed; 
and if a trial be had between the parties named in the petition, or their
privies or successors in interest, such depositions may be given in evi­
dence by either party, when the witnesses are dead or insane, or when
their attendance for oral examination cannot be had ; but such depo­ 
sitions shall be subject to the same objections for irrelevancy or incom­
petency as may be made to depositions taken pending an action. 
SEc. 51. The applicant shall pay all costs under this proceeding to
perpetuate testimony. 
SEC. 52. Upon the return of a commission to take testimony, the
circuit court, if in session, or a judge thereof in vacation, may remand 
the commission for the correction of errors or supplying omissions,
and if the same be not returned in time for the trial, the cause may,
at the discretion of the court, be continued. 
SEc. 53. An unimportant deviation from any direction relative to
taking depositions shall not cause a deposition to be excluded where 
no substantial prejudice would he done to the opposite party. 
SEC. 54. Any commissioner or other officer authorized by any State,
Territory, or District of the United States to take depositions within 
this District shall have power, at the instance of the party wishing to 
obtain the deposition of any witness therein, to cause such witness, by
process of subpoena, to appear before him, .on reasonable notice, at a 
certain time and place therein specified. 
SEC. 55. The laws of the District of Columbia, printed and pub­
Iisaed under the authority of Congress, shall he received as evidence
in the courts of this District, and in all the tribunals and public
offices of the United States, for any purpose for which the original acts
could be received, and with as much effect. 
SEC. 56. Printed copies, in volumes, of statutes, code, or other
written law enacted by the United States, or any State or Territory of
the United States, or any foreign government, purporting or proved 
to have been published by the authority thereof, or proved to be
commonly admitted as evidence of the existing laws in the eourta or 
tribunals of such State, Territory, or government, shall be admitted
by the courts and officers of this District, on all occasions, as pre­ 
sumptive evidence of such laws.
SEC. 57. The unwritten or common law of any such State, Terri­ 
tory, or foreign government may be proved as facts by parol evi­
dence ; and the books of reports of cases adjudged in their courts may 
also be admitted as presumptive evidence of such law. 
SEC. 58. Every act of any one of the legislatures of the Stat.es or
Territories of the United States, certified by the secretary, and having 
the seal of the State or Territory affixed thereto, shall be deemed 
authentic, and receive full faith and credit when offered in evidence
in any court within this District. 
SEC. 59. The records and judicial proceedings of any court of the
United States, or of auy State, attested by the clerk thereof, with the
seal of the court annexed, if there be a seal, and certified by the judge, 
chief justice, or presiding magistrate of such court, to be attested in
due form, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every 
court within this District as they have in the courts of the State, 
Territory, or District whence the said records came. The records
and judicial proceedings of the courts of any foreign country, attested 
and certified in like manner, shall be admitted as evidence thereof in
the courts of this District. 
SEC. 60. All records and exemplifications of official books, kept in 
any public office of the United St.ates, or of a St.ate, not appertaining
to a court, shall be evidence in any court or office in this District, if 
attested by the keeper of the said records or books, and the seal of
his office annexed, if there be a seal, and certified by the presiding 
justice of the county or district in which such office is, or by the
governor, the secretary of state, the chancellor, or the keeper of the 
great seal of the State, to be attested in due form and by the proper
officer; such certificate, if given by the presiding justice of a court,
shall be certified by the clerk or prothonotary of the said court, who
shall certify, under hie hand and the seal of his office, that the said 
presiding justice is duly commissioned and qualified; or if said certifi­
cate be given by the governor, the secretary of state, the chancellor,
or keeper of the great seal, it shall be under the great seal of the St.ate 
or Territory in which the certificate is made. The records and exem­
plifications so certified shall have such faith and credit given to them 
in every court and office within this District as they have, by law or
usage, in the courts or offices of the State or Territory whence the 
same shall be taken.
SEC. 61. A copy of the record or register of any deed, will, or other 
instrument of writing, which the laws of any foreign country require
to be recorded, or lodged for safe-keeping in any office or court, and
which are recorded or so lodged agreeably to such law, under the hand
of the keeper of such record or register, and the seal of the court or
office in which the same is kept, shall be good and sufficient evidence
in any court of this District to prove such deed, will, or instrument of 
writing.
SEC. 62. The record of a conveyance or other instrument of writing 
authorized or required to be recorded in the recorder's office, and duly
recorded, or a transcript thereof, certified by the recorder to be a full,
true, and correct copy, may be read in evidence with the like force 
and effect as the original conveyance or other instrument of writing. 
SEC. 63. The endorsement by the recorder or clerk of any court on
any such deed or other instrument of writing, of the time it was 
received to be recorded, shall be evidence of such time as well as such 
receipt; and the copy from the record of the usual entry of such time
and receipt, certified as provided in the previous section, or the record 
itself, shall be evidence both of the receipt and the time in like man­
ner as the original endorsement. 
SEC. 64. On the trial of any action wherein any claim or defence ia
founded on book accounts, any original entry therein, on proof of the
death of the party making such entry, and that the same is in his 
handwriting, may be admitted as evidence, the weight to be given to 
it to be determined by the court or jury, as the case may be. 
SEC. 65. The proof of the service of any process issued by the court,
or of any notice to be served upon any party, shall be as follows: 
1. If served by the marshal or other officer, his certificate thereof; or,
2. By any other person, his affidavit thereof; or, 
3. In case of publication, a printed copy, with the affidavit of the
printer, his foreman or clerk, or any competent witness, and an affi­
davit of the deposit of a copy of the summons and complaint in the
poet office, if the same shall have been so deposited; or, 
4. The written admission of the defendant. The affidavit or admis­
sion must state the time and place of service. 
SEC. 66. The clerk's endorsement upon every paper filed in his
office or in open court, and upon every process returned to him or to
court, except subpcenas, shall be presumptive evidence of the time of
the filing and return. 
SEC. 67. Either party may exhibit to the other, or his attorney, at
any time before the trial, any paper or document material to the 
action, and request an admission, in writing, of its genuineness. H
the adverse party or his attorney refuse to give such admission within
five days after the request, and the party exhibiting the paper or
document be afterwards put to any cost to prove its genuineness, and 
the same be admitted on the trial, such costs, to be ascertained at the
trial, shall be paid by the party refusing to make the admission, 
unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that there were
good reasons for the refusal. 
SEC. 68. Either party, or his attorney, may demand, in writing, of
the adverse party, an inspection and copy, or permission to take a
copy, of a book, paper, or writing in his possession, or under his con­ 
trol, containing evidence relating to the merits of the action or defence
therein. Such demand shall specify the book, paper, or writing, with
sufficient particularity to enable the other party to distinguish it, and
if compliance with the demand within five days be refused, the court 
or in vacation a judge thereof, may, on motion, and notice to the ad­
verse party, order him to give· the other, within a specified time, an 
inspection and copy, or permission to take a copy, of such book, paper,
or writing; and on failure to comply with such order, the court may
exclude the book, paper, or writing from being given in evidence by
the party so refusing, or, if wanted as evidence by the party applying,
may direct tfie jury to presume it to be such as the party by affidavit
alleges it to be. This section is not to be construed to prevent a party 
from compelling another to produce any book, paper, or document
when he is examined as a witness. 
SEC. 69. Before testifying, witnesses shall be sworn to testify the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The mode of

conscience of the witness.

necessary. 
SEC. 71. If any party summon more than three witnesses to prove
the same fact, he shall, in the discretion of the court, pay the costs
occasioned by the additional number of witnesses. 
SEC. 72. When counsel engaged in a case shall be examined as a
witness therein, on behalf of his own client, he shall thereupon retire 
from the same, and cease to take any part therein as counsel. This
section is not to preclude counsel from proving facts incidental to the 
trial, such as the loss of a paper, service of notice to produce, and the
like, without abandoning the case. 
SEC. 73. If any person who shall have resided in this District go

shall be presumed to be dead, in any case wherein his dee.th shall
come in question, unless proof be made that he was alive within that 
time.
SEC. 74. If the person so presumed dead be found to have been 
living, any person injured by such presumption shall be restored to
the rights of which he shall have been deprived by reason thereof. 
SEC. 75. A party producing a. witness shall not be allowed to 
Impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, unless it was indis­
pensable that the party should I rodnce him, or in case of manifest . 
surprise; but he may in all cases contradict 'him by other evidence,
and by showing that he has made statement.s different from his present · 
testimony.
SEC. 76. If the defendant in any action for slander, or for publishing 
a libel, shall plead in hia justification that the words spoken or pub· 
lished were true, such plea, though not maintained by the evidence,
shall not in any case be of itself proof of the malice alleged in the
complaint. 
SEC. 77. In actions for defamation, the defendant may prove, in. 
mitigation of damages, that subsequent to uttering the words, or
publishing the libel, he retracted the charge or imputation, or
acknowledged he had: been mistaken, or offered to apologize, or that
the words were not spoken in earnest, or circumstances which induced
him erroneously to make the charge, or he may show the general bad
character of the plaintiff in respect to the matter imputed, and the
jury shall allow to all such proof the weight to which they may think
it entitled.

able person, who shall consent thereto in writing, to be named by
such plaintiff, to act as his next friend in such action. 
SEC. 21. After the service and return of process against an infant 
defendant, the action shall not be further prosecuted until a guardian
for such infant shall have been appointed. Upon the request of such 
defendant, the justice shall appoint some person, who shall consent
thereto in writing, to be guardian of the defendant in defence of the 
action; and if the defendant shall not appear on the return day of
the process, or if he neglect or refuse to nominate such guardian, the 
justice may, at the request of the plaintiff, appoint any discreet person
as such guardian. The consent of the guardian or next friend shall
be filed with the justice. 
SEC. 22. The parties shall be entitled to one hour in which to make
their appearance after the time mentioned in the summons for appear­
ance, but shall not be required to remain longer than that time, unless

postpone the time of appearance until the close of such trial. 
SEC. 23. The pleadings in justices' courts shall take place upon the

direct manner, of any facts constituting a defence.

be entered by the justice in his docket; when in writing, they shall 
be filed in his office, and a reference me.de to them in his docket.
Pleadings shall not be in any particular form, but shall be such as to 
enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended. 
SEC. 21. A statement in answer or reply, that the party has not
sufficient knowledge or information in respect to a particular allega­ 
tion in the previous pleading of the adverse party to form a belief,
shall be deemed equivalent to a denial. 
SEC. 28. When the cause of action or set-off arises upon an account
or instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient
for the party to deliver the account or instrument, or a copy thereof,
to the justice, and to state that there is due to him thereon from the
adverse party a specified sum, which he claims to recover or set-off. 
SEC. 29. Every complaint, answer, or reply shall be verified by the
oath of the party pleading ; or if he be not present, by the oath of
his attorney or agent, to the effect that he believes it to be true ; the 
verification shall be oral, or in writing, in conformity with the plead­
ing verified. 
SEC. 30. Every material allegation in a complaint, or relating to a
set-off in an answer not denied by the pleading of the adverse party,
shall on the trial be taken to be true, except that when a defendant 
who has not been personally served with a copy of the complaint fails
to appear and answer, the plaintiff cannot recover without proving 
his case.
SEC. 31. Either party may object to a pleading by his adversary, or 
to any part thereof, that it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to 
understand it, or that it contains no cause of action or defence, although
it be taken as true. If the justice deems the objection well founded,
he shall order the pleading to be amended, and if the party refuse to 
amend, the defective pleading shall be disregarded.
SEC. 32. A variance between the proof on the trial and the allege­ 
tions in a pleading shall be disregarded as immaterial, unless the
justice be satisfied that the adverse party has been misled to his
prejudice thereby. 
SEC. 33. The pleadings may be amended at any time before the
trial, or during the trial, or upon the appeal to supply any deficiency
or omissions in the allegations or denials, necessary to support the
action or defence, when by such amendment substantial justice will
be promoted. If the amendment be made after the issue, and it be 
made to appear to the satisfaction of the justice that an adjourn­
ment is necessary t() the adverse party in consequence of such amend­
ment, an adjournm nt shall be granted. The justice may also, in his 
discretion, require, as a condition of an amendment, the payment of
costs to the adverse party. 
SEC. 34. To entitle the defendant to any set-off he may have against
the plaintiff, he must allege the same in his answer, and the laws 
regulating set-off in the circuit court shall in all respects be applica­
ble to a set-off in a justice's court, if the amount claimed to be set off 
do not exceed the plaintiff's demand more than one hundred dollars,
and judgment may, in like manner, be rendered by the justice in 
favor of the defendant for the sum found due from the plaintiff.
SEC. 35. If the defendant have a set-off exceeding the plaintiff's 
demand to an amount which, if found for him by the justice or the
jury, would be more than the justice is authorized to render judgment 
for, such defendant may withhold setting off such excess, and a
recovery for the amount set off and allowed, or any part thereof, shall
not be a bar to his subsequent action for the amount so withheld. 
SEC. 36. Whenever any judgment shall be set oft', it shall be the
duty of the justice before whom such set-off is allowed, to give the
plaintiff a certificate thereof, under his hand and seal. Such certifi­ 
cate, when filed with the proper justice or clerk, shall stay all further
proceedings on the judgment so set oft' and allowed, and shall be a
satisfaction thereof, except in cases where the judgment so set oft' and
allowed exceed the plaintiff's demand more than one hundred dollars; 
and in such cases so much of the judgment as was set off and allowed
before the justice shall be specified in such certificate, and shall be a 
credit on such judgment when filed as aforesaid. 
SEC. 37. No judgment upon which an appeal has been taken, and 
is pending, shall be allowed as an offset. 
SEC. 38. When the pleadings of the parties shall have taken place,
the justice may, upon the application of either party, and upon suffi­
cient cause being shown on oath, adjourn the case for any time not 
exceeding forty days. If the adjournment be on account of the
absence of testimony, it shall be for such reasonable time as will
enable the party to procure such testimony, and shall be at the cost 
of the party applying therefor, unless otherwise ordered by the
justice. 
SEC. 39. An adjournment on account of the absence of testimony
shall only be allowed upon affidavit showing the materiality of the
testimony expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has been 
used to procure it. The justice may also require the pariy applying
to state upon affidavit the evidence which be expects to obtain, and if
the adverse party thereupon admit that such evidence would be given,
and that it be considered as actually given on the trial, or offered and 
subject to being overruled as improper, the trial shall not be pos*­ 
poned. 
SEC. 40. The party applying for the adjournment shall alao, if
required by the adverse party, consent that the testimony of any 
witness of such adverse party, who is in attendance, be taken by
deposition before the justice, which shall be done accordiug ly, and 
the testimony so taken may be read on trial with the same effect aai
subject to the same objections as if the witness were produced.  
SEC. 41. If it appear in any action instituted before a justice of the
peace, at any time before trial, by the pleadings, or if it appear from
the evidence of either party on the trial, that the title to lands is ia 
question, which title is disputed by the other party, the justice shall 
immediately make an entry thereof in his docket, and cease all
further proceedings in the cause, and shall certify and return to the
circuit court a transcript of all the entries made in his docket relating 
to the case, together with all the process and other papers relating to 
the action, in the same manner and within the same time as upon an
appeal ; and thereupon the circuit court shall proceed in the cause to
final judgment and execution in the same manner as in an action 
originally begun therein, and the costs shall abide the event of the
suit; provided, however, if such transfer of the cause be made upon 
the answer of the defendant, he shall file an undertaking, with two
sufficient sureties to be approved by the justice, to the effect that they
will pay all costs of the action if it be decided ag11inst him in the
circuit court. 
SEC. 42. At the time and place appointed for the trial, if no jury
shall have been demanded by either party, the justice shall proceed
to try the cause, to hear the proofs and allegatlons of the parties, and
to determine the same according to Jaw and the right of the case,
and give judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 48. When partiee agree to enter without procees before any
justice any action in this chapter made cognizable before him, such
justice shall enter the same in his docket, and proceed to trial, judg­ 
ment, and execution, in all respects in the same manner as if a sum­
mons had been issued, served, and returned. 
SEC. 44. Before the justice shall commence an investigation of the
merits of the cause by an examination of the witnesses or the bearing
of any other testimony, either of the parties may demand of the justice 
that the cause be tried by a jury, whenever the sum claimed shall
exceed twenty dollars. If such demand be made by one of tile 
parties only, the other may have his election entered upon the docket
of the justice that the case be transferred to the circuit court, and if 
auch election be made, the justice shall cease all further proceedings in
the case, and shall certify and return to the circuit court a transcript
of all the entries made in his docket relating to the case, together with 
all the processes and other papers relating to the action, in the same
manner and within the same time as upon an appeal ; and thereupon
the circuit court shall proceed in the cause to final judgment and
execution, in the same manner as in an action originally begun
therein, and the costs shall abide the event of the action: provided, 
however, that the party so electing to transfer the case to the circuit
court shall file an undertaking, wit'bi two sufficient sureties to be
approved by the justice, to the effect that he will pay all the coats of 
the action if it be decided against him in the circuit court. If no such
election be made the case shall be tried by a jury, and no appeal shall
be allowed from a judgment rendered upon the verdict of such jury. 
SEC. 45. Thereupon the justice shall issue a venire, directed to the
marshal or any constable, commanding him to summon twelve ( or 
such number as the parties may have agreed upon) good and lawfu
men of the county of Washington, qualified to serve as jurors in the 
circuit court, who shall be nowise of kin to either party, nor interested
in the action, to appear before said justice, at a time and place to be 
named therein, to make a jury for the trial of the cause between the
parties therein named. 
SEC. 46. Parties may agree upon any number of jurors less than
twelve to try the cause, in which case the jury shall consist of such 
number, not exceeding twelve, as the parties may agree upon.
SEC. 47. If the plaintiff' shall demand a jury in any cause where a. 
sum of money is claimed, and the jury shall not find a verdi~ for at
leasfi twenty dollars in his favor, such plaintiff' shall pay the feee of
such jury and all additional costs occasioned by auchjury trial. 
SEC. 48. The marshal or constable to whom the venire may be
directed shall execute the same fairly and impartially, and shall not
summon any person whom he has reason to believe is biased or preju­ 
diced for or against either of the parties ; he shall summon the jurors
personally, and shall make a list of the persons summoned, which he
shall certify and annex to the venire and return to the justice. Ha 
·sufficient number of competent jurors cannot be obtained from the
panel returned, the marshal or constable shall immediately summon
others to serve in their places. 
SEC. 49. Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are
several parties on either side they shall join in a challenge before it 
can be made. The challenges shall be to individual jurors, and shall
be peremptory or for cause. Each party shall be entitled to a per­
emptory challenge of one-third of the jury. 
SEC. 50. Challenges for cause may be taken on any ground that 
would be a good cause of challenge on the trial of an action in the
circuit court. Challenges for cause shall be tried by the justice in a
summary way. 
SEC. 51. When the jury is selected the justice shall administer to
them the following oath or affirmation : '' You and each of you do 
solemnly swear (or affirm) that you will well and truly try the matter
of difference between -- --, plaintiff, and -- -, defendant, 
and a true verdict give according to the evidence: So help you God."
SEC. 52. After the jury are sworn they shall sit together and hear 
the allegations and proofs of the parties, which shall be delivered
publicly in their presence. 
SEC. 53. The rules of evidence and the competency of witnesses
shall be the same as in the circuit court, except as in this chapter is
otherwise provided. 
SEC. 54. If a witness, on being produced, shall be objected to as
incompetent, such objection shall be tried and determined by the
justice, and evidence may be given in support of or against such
objection ae in other cases, or the proposed witness may be examined
on oath by the party objecting ; and in such last case no other testi­
mony sh!f,ll be received from either party as to the competency of such 
witnees, 
SEC. 55. After bearing the proofs and allegations of the partie1,
the jury shall be kept together in some convenient place, under the
charge of a constable, until they have agreed upon their verdict, or
shall be discharged by the justice, and for that purpose the justice
shall administer to such constable the following oath : " You do
swear that you will, to the best of your ability, keep the persons
sworn as jurors on this trial together in some private and convenient
place, without meat or drink, except such as shall be ordered by me; 
and that you will not suffer any communication to be made to them ;

8. Apportionment of rent, hire, or money,
in cue of death of one interested. 
SEC. 1. Rent of every kind may be recovered by distress or by
action. It may be recovered from the lessee or other person owing
it, or his assignee, or the personal representatives of either. It shall
not, however, be recovered from a mortgage not in possession, or a
trustee not in interest, except by express agreement. 
SEC. 2. Rent may be distraincd for, within three years from the time
it becomes due, and not afterwards, whether the lease be ended or
not. The distress shall be made by the marshal or any constable, 
under a warrant from a justice of the peace, founded upon an affidavit
of the person claiming the rent, or his agent, that the a.mount of 
money or other thing to be distrained for, (to be specified in the
affidavit,) as he verily believes, is due to the claimant for rent reserved
upon contract from the person from whom it is claimed. 
SEC. 3. The distress may be levied upon any goods and chattels of
the lessee, or his assignee or under-tenant, found on the premises, or
which may have been removed therefrom not more than thirty days;
but the goods and chattels of the under-tenant shall be liable only
for rent becoming due after his under-tenancy commenced. If tbe
goods and chattels of such lessee, assignee, or under-tenant, when
carried on the premises, are subject to a lien which is valid against
his creditors, his interest only in such goods and chattels shall be
liable to distress. If any lien be created thereon while they are upon
the leased or rented premises, they shall be liable to distress, bot for 
not more than one year's rent, whether it shall have accrued before
or after the creation of the lien. No distress shall be levied on any 
goods and chattels exempt from execution ; and no other goods and
chattels shall be liable to distress than such as are declared to be so
liable by this section. 
SEc. 4. If, after the commencement of any tenancy, a lien be 
obtained or created by deed of trust, mortgage, or otherwise, upon
the interest or property in goods and chattels on premises leased or 
rented, of' any person liable for the rent, the party having such lien
may remove said goods and chattels from tbe premises, if in other 
respects entitled so to do, upon his paying to the person entitled to 
the rent so much as is in arrear, and securing to him so much as is 
to become due, the whole amount paid and secured not being more,
altogether, than a year's rent in any case. Nothing in this or the 
preceding section shall affect any lien for taxes. 
SEC. 5. Any officer having such distress warrant, if there be need
for it, may, in the day time, break open and enter into any house or
close in which there may be goods liable to the distress; and may
either in the day or night break open and enter into any house or 
close wherein there may be any goods so liable which have been
fraudulently or clandestinely removed from the leased or rented
premises. 
SEC. 6. Where distress shall be made for rent justly due, and any
irregularity or unlawful act shall be afterwards done by the party
distraining or his agent, the distress shall not be deemed to be un­
lawful, nor the party making it be therefore deemed a trespasser from 
the beginning; but the party u.ggrieved by such irregularity or unlaw­
ful act may, by action, recover full satisfaction for the special damage 
he shall have sustained thereby. 
SEC. 7. Where goods are distrained for rent reserved in a share of
the crop, or in any other thing than money, the claimant of the rent
having given the tenant ten days' notice, or if the tenant be out of 
this District, having set up the notice in some conspicuous place on
the premises, may apply to the circuit court; and said court having 
ascertained the value, either by its own judgment, or, if either party
require it, by the verdict of a jury empanneled without pleading, 
may order the goods distrained to be sold, to pay the amount so
ascertained. 
SEC. 8. On the determination by death or otherwise of the estate
or other thing, from or in respect of which any rent, hire, or money 
coming duo at fixed periods, issues, or is derived, or on the death of
any person interested in such rent, hire, or money, the person or the
personal representative or assignee of the person who would have 
been entitled but for such death or determination to the rent, hire,
or money coming due at any such period, shall have a proportion 
thereof, according to the time which shall have elapsed of the time
for which the said rent, hire, or other money was growing due, in­ 
cluding the day of such death or determination, deducting a propor­
tional part of the charges. For the recovering of such proportion, 
the said person, representative, or assignee shall, after such fixed
period, have such remedies as he would have had for recovering the
whole of such rent, hire, or other money, if entitled thereto.
