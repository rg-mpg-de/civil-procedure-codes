ritory or absent t erefrom, must not be less than one month.

or absent efendant is known, the court or judge must di
rect a co y of the summons and complaint to be forthwith
deposite in_ the postoﬂice, directed to the person to be
served at his lace of residence. When publication 1S or
dered, persona service of a copy of the summons and com
plaint out of the Territory, is equivalent to publication and
eposit in the postofﬁce; and in either case the service of
the summons is complete at the expiration of the time pre
scribed by the order or ublication.
SEC. 4147. When t e action is against two or more de
fendants jointly or severally liable on a contract and the
-
summons is served on one or more but not on all of them,

the same manner as if the were the only defendants.
SEC. 4148. Proof of t e service of summons and com
plaint must be as follows:
1. If served by the Sheriff, his certiﬁcate thereof;

his foreman or principal clerk, showing the same; and an
aﬁidavit of a deposit of a copy of the summons in the post
oﬂice the same haﬁrpeen depfosilted ctr, d I f
4. e written a ission o t e e en ant. n case o
service otherwise than by publication, the certiﬁcate or af
ﬁdavit must state the time and place of service.
SEC. 4149. From the time of the service of the sum
mons and of a copy of a complaint in a civil action where
service of a copy of the complaint is required, or of the com
pletion of the publication, when service by publication is
ordered, the court is deemed to have acquired Jurisdiction of
the parties and to have control of all the subseguent proceed
ings. The voluntary appearance of a defen ant is equiva
lent to personal service of the summons and copy of the
complaint _upon him.
SECTION 4160. The pleadings are the formal allega

tioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemp
tioner, within sixty days after the last redemption, and
within six months after the sale, on paying the sum paid on
the last previous redemption, with four per cent thereon in
addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which

must in like manner be given to the Sheriff, and ﬁled with
the Recorder; and if such notice be not ﬁled, the property
may be redeemed without paying such tax, assessment, or
lien. If no redemption be made within six months after
the sale, the purchaser, or his assignee, is entitled toa con
veyance; or, if so redeemed, whenever sixty days have
elapsed, and no other redemption has been made, and notice
thereon given, the time for redemption by a redemptioner,
has expired, and the last redemptioner, or his assignee, is
entitled to a Sheriif’s deed at the expiration of six months
after the sale; but in all cases the judgment debtor shall
have the entire period of six months from the date of the sale
to redeem the property. If the judgment debtor redeem, he
must make the same payments as are re uired to effect a
redemption by a redemptioner. If the de tor redeem, the

ment under which the sale has been made is payable in a
speciﬁed kind of money or currency, payments must be
made in the same kind of money or currency, and a tender

SEC. 4495. A redemptioner must produce to the oﬂicer
or person from whom he seeks to redeem and serve with his
notice to the sheriff;

til a redemption, an a redemptioner, from the time of his
redem tion until another redemption, is entitled to receive,

or the value of the use and occupation thereof. But when
any rents or proﬁts have been received by the judgment
creditor or purchaser, or his or their assigns, from the prop
erty thus sold preceding such redemption, the amount of
such rents and proﬁts shall be a credit upon the redemption
money to be paid ;and if the redemptioner or jud ent debt
or, before the expiration of the time allowed or such re
demption deman s in writing of such purchaser, or credi
tor, or his assigns, a written and veriﬁed statement of the
amounts of such rents and roﬁts thus received, the period

ecution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom
in consequence of irregularities in the proceedings concern
ing the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the judgment,

ment creditor. If the purc aser of property at sheriff’s sale,
or his successor in interest, fail to recover possession in con
seiljuence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the
sa e, or because the property so d was not subject to execu
tion and sale, the court having jurisdiction thereof must,
after notice and on motion of such party in interest, or his
attorney, revive the original judgment in the name of the
petitioner, for the amount paid by such purchaser at the
sale, with interest thereon from the time of payment at the
same rate that the original judgment bore; and the judg
ment so revived has the same force and effect as wou d an
original jud ent of the date of the revival, and no more.
SEC. 449 . When upon an execution_a ainst several
persons more than a due proportion of the ]11 gment is sat
isﬁed out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of one
of them, or one of them pays, without a sale, more than his

an when a judgment is against several, and is upon an
obligation of one of them, as security for another, and the
surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale
of his roperty or before sale, he may compel repayment
from t e principal. In such case, the person so paying or
contributing is entitled to the beneﬁt of the judgment, to
enforce contribution or repayment, if, within ten days after
his payment, he ﬁle with the clerk of the court where the
judgment was rendered, notice of his gayment and claim to

SECTION 4520. There can be but one action for the recov
ery of any debt, or the enforcement of any right secured by
mortgage upon real estate or ersonal property, which ac-.
tion must be in accordance wit the provisions of this chap
ter. In such action the court may, by its judgment, direct
a sale of the incumbered property (or so much thereof as
may be necessary) and the application of the proceeds of
the sale to the payment of the costs of the court and the ex
penses of the sale, and the amount due to the plaintiff; and
sales of real estate under judgments of foreclosure of mort
gages and liens are subject to redemption as in the case of
sales under execution; and if it a pear from the Sheriﬂ:"s re
turn that the proceeds are insu cient, and a balance still
remains due, judgment can then be docketed for such bal
ance against the defendant or defendants personally liable
for the debt, and it becomes a lien on the real estate of such
'udgment debtor, as in other cases on which execution may
e issued. No person holding a conveyance from or under
the mortgagor of the property mortgaged, or having a lien
thereon, which conveyance or lien does not appear of re
cord in the proper oﬂice at the commencement 0 the action,
need be made a party to such action; and the judgment
therein rendered, and the proceedings therein had, are as
conclusive against the party holding such unrecorded con
veyance or lien as if he had been made a party to the ac
tion. .
SEC. 4521. If there be surplus money remaining, after
Eayment of the amount due on the mortgage, lien or incum
rance, with costs, the court may cause the same to be paid
to the person entitled to it, and in the meantime may direct
it to be deposited in court.
SEC. 4522. If the debt for which the mort age, lien or
incumbrance is held is not all due, so soon as su cient of the
property has been sold to pay the amount due, with costs,
the sale must cease; and afterwards, as often as more be
comes due, for princi al or interest, the court may, on
motion, order more to e sold. But if the propert cannot
be sold in ortions, without injury to the parties, t e whole
may be or ered to be sold in the ﬁrst instance, and the en
tire debt and costs paid, there being a rebate of interest
where such rebate is proper.
SEC. 4523. A mortgage of real property shall not be
deemed a conveyance, whatever its terms, so as to enable
the owner of the mortga e to recover ossession of the real
property without a forec osure and sa e.
SEC. 4524. When an action is brou ht for the foreclos
ure of a mortgage or lien. other than or purchase money,
an aﬂidavit that all taxes levied upon the mortga e or lien,
or upon the debt secured thereby, have been pai , must be
attached to the complaint in such action; and in case the
same is not attached at the commencement of the action,
the court in which the suit is pending, on motion of the de
fendant therein must make an order sta ing all proceedings
in such action until such afﬁdavit has been ﬁled; and it is
the duty of the court, before enterin a decree or judgment
in any such case, to require such afﬁ avit or proof.

lished by evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without
such allegation in the complamt, to the satisfaction of the
court, that the property, or any part of it, is so situated that

discretion, to the referees, must be a ortioned among the
different arties to the action, equita y.
SEC. 4 77. When a lien is on an undivided interest or
estate of any of the parties, such lien, if apartitionbemade,
shall thenceforth be a charge only on the share assigned to
such party; but such share must ﬁrst be charged with its
just proportion of the costs of the partition, in preference to
such lien.
SEC. 4578. VVhen a part of the property only is ordered
to be sold, if there be an estate for life or years, in an undi
vided share of the whole property, such estate may be set
off in any art of the property not ordered to be sold.
SEC. 4579. The roceeds of the sale of incumbered

court may, in its discretion, order such securities to be ex
hausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may
order a just reduction to be made from the amount of the
lien on the property on account thereof.
SEC. 4581. The proceeds of sale and the securities taken
by the referees, or any part thereof, must be distributed by
them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the court so
directs. But in case no direction be given, all of such pro
ceeds and securities must be paid into court or deposited
therein, or as directed by the court.

or parcel belonging to persons who are parties to the action,
an who are known, are aid into court, the action may be
continued as between suc parties for the determination of
their respective claims thereto, which must be ascertained
and adjudged by the court. Further testimony may be taken
in court or by a referee, at the discretion of the court, and
the court may, if necessary, require such parties to present
the facts or law in controversy, by pleadings as in an orig
inal action.

made equal between the parties, accor ing to their respec
tive rights, wtihout prejudice to the rights and interests of
some of them, and a partition be ordered, the court may ad
judge compensation to be made by one party to another, on
account of the inequality; but such compensation shall not

by execution against such shares, and against other property
held b the respective parties. When, however, litigation
arises etween some of the parties only, the court may re
quire the expense of such litigation to e paid by the par
ties thereto, or any of them.
SEC. 4605. The court, with the consent of the parties,

SEC. 4842. An appeal from aJustice’s or Probate Court
is not elfectual for any purpose, unless an undertakin be
ﬁled, with two or more sureties, in the sum of one hun red
dollars, for the payment of the costs on the a peal; or, if a
stay of proceedin s be claimed, in a sum equa to twice the
amount of the ju gment, including costs, when the judg
ment if for the (payment of money; or twice the value of the
property, inclu ing costs, when the judgment if for the re
cover of speciﬁc personal property, and must be condi
tione , when the action is for the recovery of money, that
the appellant will pay the amount of the jud ent ap
ealed from and al costs, if the appeal be wit drawn or
ismissed, or the amount of any judgment, and all costs
that may be recovered against him in the action in the Dis
trict Court. When the action is for the recovery of speciﬁc
personal property, the undertaking must be conditioned
that the a pellant will pay the 'udgment and costs appealed
from, an obey the order of t e court made therein, if the
appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or any judgment and
costs that ma be recovered against him in said action in
the District “ourt, and will obey any order made by the
court therein. When the judgment appealed from directs
the delivery of possession of real property, the execution of
the same cannot be stayed unless a written undertaking be
executed on the part of the appellant, with two or more
sureties, to the eﬁect that durin the possession of such
property by the appellant, he wi l not commit or suffer to
e committed, any waste thereon, and that if the appeal be
dismissed or withdrawn, or the jud ent aiﬁrmed, or judg
ment be recovered against him in t e action in the District

costs that ma be recovered against him in sai action in
the District ourt, not exceeding the sum to be ﬁxed by the

A deposit of the amount of the judgment, includin all costs
appealed from, or of the value of the property inc uding all
costs in actions for the recovery of speciﬁc personal prop
erty, with the Justice or Judge, is equivalent to the ling
of the undertaking; and in such cases the Justice or Judge
must transmit the money to the Clerk of the District Court,
to be by him paid out on the order of the court. The ad
verse party may except to the suﬁicienc of the sureties
within ﬁve days after the ﬁling of the un ertakin , and un
less they or other sureties justify before the ustice or
Judge from whom the ap eal is taken, within ﬁve days
thereafter, upon notice to t e adverse part , to the amounts
stated in their afﬁdavits, the appeal must e regarded as if
no such undertaking had been 'ven.
SEC. 4843. If an execution e issued, on the ﬁling of the
undertaking stayingigroceedings, the Justice or J udge must,
by order, direct the o cer to stay all proceedings on t e same.
Such oﬂicer must, upon pa ment of his fees for services ren
dered on the execution, t ereupon relin uish all roperty
levied upon and deliver the same to the ju gment de tor, to
gether with all moneys collected from sales or otherwise. If
is fees be not paid, the officer may retain so much of the prop
erty or procee s thereof as may be necessary to pay the same.
SEC. 4844. Upon an appeal on (questions of law alone,
the District Court may review all or ers aifecting the jud -
ment appealed from, and may set aside, or conﬁrm, or mo ify
any or all of the proceedings subsequent to and depend
ent upon such judgment, and may, if necessary or proper,
order a new trial in the District Court. When the action
is tried anew on appeal, the trial must be conducted in all
respects as trials in the District Court. The rovisions of
this Code as to changing the place of trial, an all the pro
visions as to trial in the District Court, are a plicable to
trials on appeal in the District Court. Fora fai ure to pros
ecute on appeal, or unnecessary delay in bringing it to a
hearing, the District Court, after notice, may order the ap
peal to be dismissed with costs; and if it appear to such court
that the ap eal was made solely for delay, it may add to the
costs such ama es as may be just, not exceeding twenty
ﬁve per cent of t e judgment appealed from. Judgments
rendered in the District Court on a peal have the same
force and eifect, and may be enforce in the same manner
as judgments in actions commenced in the District Court.
SECTION 4860. VVhen a judgment is recovered against
one or more of several persons jointly indebted upon an ob
liglation, by proceeding as provided in section 4147, those
w o were not originally served with the summons, and did
not appear to the action, may be summoned to show cause
why they should not be bound by the judgment in the same
manner as thought they had been originally served with
the summons.
SEC. 4861. The summons, as provided in the last sec
tion, must describe the judgment, and require the erson
summoned to show cause why he should not be boun by it,
and must be served in the same manner, and returnable
within the same time as the original summons. It is not
necessary to ﬁle a new complaint.
SEC. 4862. The summons must be accompanied by an
affidavit of the laintiff, his agent, representative or attor
ney, that the ju gment, or some part thereof, remains un
satisﬁed, and must specif the amount due thereon.
SEC. 4863. Upon suc summons the defendant may an
swer within the time speciﬁed therein, denying the jud ment
or setting up an(y defense which ma have arisen sug
seqluently, except a ischarge from liabi ity by the statute
of imitations; or he may deny his liability on the obliga
tion upon which the jud ent was recovered.
SEC. 4864. If the efendant in his answer, deny the
judgment, or set up any defense which may have arisen
subsequently, the summons with the afﬁdavits annexed, and
the answer constitute the written allegations in the case; if
he deny his liability on the obligation upon which the judg
ment was recovered, a copy of the original complaint and
judgment, the summons with the affidavit annexed, and the
answer, constitute such written allegations.
SEC. 4865. The issues formed may be tried as in other
cases; but when the defendant denies in his answer, any
liability on the obligation upon which the judgment was
rendered, if a verdict be found against him, it must be for
not exceeding the amount remaining unsatisﬁed on such or
iginal judgment, with interest thereon.
SECTION 4870. The defendant in any action may, at an
time before the trial or judgment, serve upon the plainti
an offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for the
sum or roperty, or to the effect therein speciﬁed. If the
lainti accept the offer, and give notice thereof within ﬁve
ays, he may ﬁle the offer, w'1th proof of notice of accept
ance, and the clerk must thereupon enter judgment accord
ingiy. If the notice of acceptance be not given, the offer is
to e deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given in evidence
u on the trial; and if the plaintiff fail to obtain a more favor
a le 'udgment, he cannot recover costs accruing subse
uent y to the offer, but must pay the defendant’s costs from
t e time of the offer.

copy, or permission to take a copy, of entries of account in
any book, or of any document, or paper in his possession, or
under his control, containing evidence relating to the merits
of the action, or the defense therein. If compliance with
the order be refused, the court may exclude the book, docu
ment, or pa er from being given 1n evidence; or, if wanted
as evidence y the party applyin , may direct the jury to
presume them to be such as he al eges them to be ; and the
court may also punish the party refusing, for a. contempt.
This section is not to be construed to prevent a party from

the real estate for the payment of suc debts, at the end of
the time limited for the presentation of claims against the
estate, the court must direct the executor or administrator
to deliver possession of all the real estate to the heirs at law
or devisees.
SEC. 5431. If any person before the granting of letters
testamentary or of administration, embezzles or alienates
any of the moneys, goods, chattels or effects of a decedent,
he is chargeable therewith and liable to an action by the ex
ecutor or administrator of the estate for double the value of
the groperty so embezzled or alienated, to be recovered for
the eneﬁt of the estate.
SEC. 5432. If any executor, administrator or other per
son interested in the estate of a decedent, complains to the
Probate Judge on oath, that an person is suspected to have
concealed, embezzled, smuggle , conveyed away or disposed
of any moneys, oods or c attels of the decedent, or has in
his possession or nowledge, any deeds, conveyances, bonds,
contracts or other writings which contain evidences of, or
tend to disclose the right, title, interest or claim of the dece
dent to any real or personal estate, or an claim or demand,
or any last will, the Judge may cite suc person to appear
before the Probate Court, and may examine him on oath
upon the matter of such complaint. If such erson is not
in the county where letters have been grante , he ma be
cited and examined, either before the Probate Court 0 the
county where he is found, or before the court issuin the
citation. But if in the latter case he aﬁpears and is ound
innocent, his necessary expenses must e allowed him out
of the estate.
SEC. 5433. If the person so cited refuses to appear and
submit to an examination, or to answer such interrogatories
as may be put to him, touching the matters of the com laint,
the court may, by warrant for that purpose, commit im to
the county jail, there to remain in close custody until he
submits to the order of the court, or is discharged according
to law. If upon such examination it appears that he has
concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away or dis
posed of any moneys, goods or chattels of the decedent, or
that he has in his possession or knowledge any deeds, con
veyances, bonds, contracts or other writin s tending to dis
close the right, title, interest or claim o the decedent to
an real or personal estate, claim or demand, or any last
wi l of the decedent, the Probate Court may make an order
requiring such person to disclose his knowledge thereof to
the executor or administrator, and may commit him to the
county jail there to remain until the order is complied with
or he is discharged according to law; and all such interrog
atories and answers must be in Writing, signed by the party
examined, and be ﬁled in the Probate Court. The order for
such disclosure made upon such examination, is primary
evidence of the right of such administrator to such pro erty
in any action brou ht for the recovery thereof; an any
jud ent recovere therein must be for double the value
of t e roperty as assessed by the court or 'ury, or for re
turn o the propert , and damages in ad 'tion thereto,
equal to the value o such property. In addition to the ex
amination of the party, witnesses may be produced and ex
amined on either side.
SEC. 5434. The Probate Judge, upon the complaint, on
oath, of any executor or administrator, may cite any person
who has been entrusted with any part of the estate of the
decedent, to appear before such court, and require him to
render a full account, on oath, of any moneys, goods, chat
tels, bonds, accounts, or other pro erty or papers belonging
to the estate, which have come to his ossession in trust for
the executor or administrator, and of is proceedings there
on; and if the person so cited refuses to appear and render
such account, the court may proceed against him as pro
vided in the preceding section.

and recorded, the Judge or the court must select, desi ate,
set apart, and cause to be recorded, a homestead for t e use
of the persons hereinbefore named in the manner provided
in this chapter, out of the real estate belonging to the dece
dent.
SEC. 5442. If the amount set apart be insufficient for
the su port of the widow and children, or either, the Pro
bate ourt or Judge must make such reasonable allowance
out of the estate as shall be necessary for the mainte
nance of the family, according to their circumstances, during
the progress of the settlement of the estate- which, in case
of an insolvent estate, must not be longer than one year af
ter grantin letters testamentary or of administration.
SEC. 54 3. Any allowance made by the court or J udge,
in accordance with the provisions of t is chapter, must e
paid in preference to all other charges except funeral
charges and expenses of administration: and any such al
lowance, whenever made, may, in the discretion of the
court or Jud e, take effect from the death of the decedent.
SEC. 5 VVhen pro erty is set apart to the use of the
family, in accordance wit the provisions of this chapter, if
the decedent left a widow or surviving husband, and no
minor child, such (property is the pro erty of the widow or
surviving husban . f the decedent eft also a minor child
or children, the one-half of such pro erty shall belong to
the widow or surviving husband, an the remainder to the
child, or in equal shares to the children, if there be more
than one. If there be no widow or surviving husband, the
whole belongs to the minor child or children. If the prop
erty set apart be a homestead, selected from the separate
property of the deceased, the court can onl set it apart for
a limited period, to be designated in the or er, and the title
vests in the heirs of the deceased, subject to such order.
SEC. 5445. If, upon the return of the inventory of the
estate of a deceased erson, it shall appear therefrom that
the value of the who e estate does not exceed the sum of ﬁf
teen hundred dollars, and if there be a Widow or minor
children of the deceased, the court or a judge thereof shall,
by order, require all persons interested to a pear on a day
ﬁxed, to show cause why the whole of sai estate should
not be assigned for the use and support of the family of the
deceased. Notice thereof shall be given and proceedings
had in the same manner as upon the settlement of accounts
of executors and administrators. If, upon the hearing, the
court ﬁnds that the value of the estate does not exceed the
sum of ﬁfteen hundred dollars, it shall, by a decree for that
purpose, assign for the use and support of the widow and
minor children, if there be a. Widow and minor children, and
if no widow, then for the children, if there be any, and if no
children, then for the widow, the whole of the estate, after
the payment of the expenses of the last illness of the de
ceased, funeral char es and expenses of administration, and
there must be no furt er proceedings in the administration,
unless further estate be discovered; and when it so ap ears
that the value of the whole estate does not excee the
sum of ﬁfteen hundred dollars, it is in the discretion of the
Probate Court to dispense with the re lar (proceedings, or
any part thereof, prescribed in this Tit e, an there must be
had a summary administration of the estate, and an order
of distribution thereof at the end of six months after the
issuing of letters; the notice to creditors must be given to
present their claims within four months after the ﬁrst pub
lication of such notice, and those not so presented, are
barred as in other cases.
SEC. 5446. If the widow has a maintenance derived
from her own property equal to the portion set apart to her
by the preceding sections of this cha ter, the whole pro erty
so set apart, other than her hal of the homestea ,
must go to the minor children.
SEC. 5447. If the homestead selected by the husband
and wife or either of them, during their coverture, and re
corded while both were living, was selected from the com
munit property, or from the separate property of the per
son se ecting or joining in the selection of the same, it vests,
on the death of the husband or wife, absolutely in the sur
vivor. If the homestead was selected from t e separate
property of either the husband or the wife, without his or
er consent, it vests, on the death of the person from whose
property it was selected, in his or her heirs, subject to the
power of the Probate Court to assign it for a limited period,
to the family of the decedent. In either case it is not sub
ject to the payment of any debt or liability contracted by
or existing against the husband and wife, or either of them
previous to or at the time of the death of such husband or
wife, except in satisfaction of 'udgments obtained:
1. Before the declaration o homestead was ﬁled for rec
ord and which constitute liens upon the premises;
2. On debts secured by mechanics’, laborers’ or venders’
liens u on premises;
3. n debts secured b mortgages on the premises, exe
cuted and acknowledge for any portion of the purchase
price thereof, or by the husband an wife, or by an unmar
ried claimant;
4. On debts secured by mortgages on the premises exe
cuted and recorded before the declaration of homestead was
ﬁled for record.
SEC. 5448. If the homestead selected and recorded prior
to the death of the decedent is returned in the inventory,
appraised at not exceeding ﬁve thousand dollars in value,
the Probate Court must, by order, set it off to the ersons
in whom title is vested by the preceding section. f there
are subsisting liens or incumbrances on the homestead, they
must be paid out of the funds of the estate, if there remain
sufficient for that purpose, after the payment of all claims
allowed a ainst the estate. _
SEC. 5 49. If the homestead, as selected and recorded,
be appraised at more than ﬁve thousand dollars, the ap
praisers must, before theg make their return, determine
whether the premises can e divided without material inju
ry, and if they ﬁnd that they can be thus divided, they must
admeasure and set apart to the parties entitled thereto such
portion of the premises, including the dwelling house, as will
amount in the value to the sum of ﬁve thousand dollars,
and make report thereof, giving the metes, bounds and full
description of the portion set apart as a homestead. If the
appraisers ﬁnd that the premises exceeded in value, at the
time of their selection, the sum of ﬁve thousand dollars,
and that they cannot be divided without material injury,
they must report such ﬁnding, and thereafter the court
may make an order for the sale of the premises and the
distribution of the proceeds to the parties entitled thereto.
SEC. 5450. Any two of the appraisers concurring, may
discharge the duties imposed upon the three, and make the
report. A dissenting report may be made by the third ap
praiser. The report must state fully the acts of the apprais
ers. Both reports may be heard and considered by the court
in determining a conﬁrmation or rejection of the majority
report, but the minority report must in no case be con
ﬁrmed.
SEC. 5451. When the report of the a praisers is ﬁled,
the court must set a da for hearing any o Jections thereto,
from any one intereste in the estate. Notice of the hear
ing must be given for such time and in such manner as the
court may direct. If the court be satisﬁed that the report
is correct, it must be conﬁrmed, otherwise rejected. In
case the report is rejected, the court may appoint new ap
praisers to examine and report upon the homestead, and
similar proceedings may be had for the conﬁrmation or re
jection of their re ort as upon the ﬁrst report.
SEC. 5452. T 1e costs of all proceedings in the Probate
Court provided for in this chapter, must be paid by the es
tate as expenses of administration. Persons succeeding
bv purchase, or otherwise, to the interests, rights and title
oi successors to homesteads, or to the right to have home
steads set apart to them as in this chapter provided, have
all the rights and beneﬁts conferred by law on the persons
whose interests and rights they ac uire.
SEC. 5453. A certiﬁed copy o ever ﬁnal order made
in pursuance of this chapter, by whic a report is con
ﬁrmed, pro erty assigned or sale conﬁrmed, must be record

SECTION 5460. Every executor or administrator must,
immediately after his appointment, cause to be published in
some newspaper of the county, if there be one, if not, then
in such newspaper as may be designated by the court, a no.
tice to the creditors of the decedent, requirin all persons
having claims against him to exhibit them wit the neces
sary vouchers, to the executor or administrator, at the place
of his residence or business, to be speciﬁed in the notice.
Such notice must be ublished as often as the Judge or court
shall direct, but not ess than once a week for four weeks.
The court or Judge may also direct additional notice by
publication or posting. In case such executor or adminis
trator resigns, or is removed, before the time expressed in
the notice, his successor must give notice only for the un
expired time allowed for suc resentation; Provided,
That when no newspaper is ublis ed in the county, the no
tice shall be posted in not ess than three public places in
the county, one of which shall be at the court house door,
fo1(-1 such time, not less than four weeks, as the court may
or er.
SEC. 5461. The time ex ressed in the notice must be
ten months after its ﬁrst pu lication, when the estate ex
ceeds in value the sum of ﬁfteen hundred dollars, and four
months when it does not.
SEC. 5462. After the notice is given, as re uired in the
preceding section, a copy thereof, with the a davit of due
publication or of publication and posting must be ﬁled and
upon such afﬁdavit or other testimony to the satisfaction of
the court, an order or decree showing that due notice to
‘creditors has been given, and directin that such order or
decree be entered in the minutes an recorded, must be
made by the court.
SEC. 5463. All claims arising upon contracts, whether
the same be due, not due or contingent, must be presented
within the time limited in the notice, and any claim not so
presented is barred forever; Pro 1:-ided, Izoive ver, That when
it ismade to apqpar by the aﬁidavit of the claimant, to the
satisfaction of t e court or a Jud e thereof that the claim
ant had no notice as provided in t is chapter, by reason of
being out of the Territory, it may be presented at any time
before a decree of distribution is entered.
SEC. 5464. Every claim which is due, when presented
to the executor or administrator, must be su ported by the
afﬁdavit of the claimant, or some one in his ehalf, that the
amount is justly due, that no payments have been made
thereon which are not credited, and that there are no off
sets to the same, to the knowledge of the afﬁant. If the
claim be not due when presented, or be contingent. the par
ticulars of such claim must be stated. When the aiﬁdavit
is made by a erson other than the claimant, he must set
forth in the a davit the reason why it is not made by the
claimant. The oath may be taken before any oﬂicer au
thorized to administer oaths. The executor or administrator
may also require satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be pro
duced in support of the claim. If the estate be insolvent, no
greater rate of interest shall be allowed upon any claim af
ter the ﬁrst publication of notice to creditors than is allowed
on judgments obtained in the District Court.
SEC. 5465. Any Probate Judge may present a claim
against the estate of a decedent, for allowance. to the exe
cutor or administrator thereof; and if the executor or ad
ministrator allows the claim, he must, in writing, designate
some Probate Judge of an adjoining county, who, upon the
presentation of such claim to him, is vested with the same
ower to allow or reject it as he would have if the will had
een proved or administration granted in his own county;
and t e Probate Judge presenting such claim, in case of its
rejection by the executor or administrator, or by such Pro
bate Judge as shall have acted upon it, has the same right
to sue in a proper court for its recovery as other persons
have when t eir claims against an estate are rejected.
SEC. 5466. When a claim, accompanied by the affidavit
required in this chapter, is presented to the executor or ad
ministrator, he must indorse thereon his allowance or rejec
tion, with the day and date thereof. If he allows the claim,
it must be presented to the Probate Judge for his approval,
who must, in the same manner, indorse upon it his allow
ance or rejection. If the executor or administrator, or the
Judge, refuse or neglect to indorse such allowance or rejec
tion for ten days after the claim has been presented to him,
such refusal or neglect is equivalent to-a rejection; and if
the presentation be made by a Notary, the certiﬁcate of such
Notary, under seal, is primary evidence of such presentation
and rejection. If the claim be presented to the executor or
administrator, before the ex iration of the time limited for
the presentation of claims, t e same is presented in time,
thou h acted upon by the executor or administrator, and by
the ud e, after the ex iration of such time.
SEC. 467. Every c aim allowed by the executor or ad
ministrator, and approved by the Probate Judge on a
copy thereof, as hereinafter rovided, must, within thirty
days thereafter, be ﬁled in the robate Court, and be ranked
among the acknowledged debts of the estate, to be paid in
due course of administration. If the claim is founded on a
bond, bill, note, or any other instrument, a copy of such in
strument must accom any the claim, and the original in
strument must be exhi ited if demanded, unless it is lost or
destro ed, in which case the claimant must accompany his
claim y his aﬁidavit, containin a copy or particular de
scription of such instrument, an stating its loss or destruc
tion. If the claim or any part thereof is secured by a mort
gage or other lien which has been recorded in the ofﬁce of
the Recorder of the county in which the land affected by it
lies, it is sufﬁcient to describe the mortgage on lien, and re
fer to the date, volume, and page of its record. If, in any
case, the claimant has left any original voucher in the
hands of the executor or administrator, or suffered the same
to be ﬁled in court, he may withdraw the same when acopy
thereof has been already, or is then attached to his claim.
A brief description of every claim filed must be entered by
the clerk in the register, showing the name of the claimant,
the amount and character of the claim, rate of interest, and
date of allowance.
SEC. 5468. When a claim is rejected, either by the ex
ecutor or administrator, or the Probate Judge, the holder
must bring suit in the proper court against the executor or
administrator, within three months after the date of its
rejection, if it be then due, or within two months after it
becomes due, otherwise the claim is forever barred.
SEC. 5469. No claim must be allowed by the executor
or administrator, or by the Probate Judge, which was
barred by the statute of limitations, at the time of the death
of the decedent. VVhen a claim is presented to the Probate
Judge for his allowance, he may, in his discretion, exam
ine the applicant and others, on oath, and hear any other
legal evidence touchin the validity of the claim.
SEC. 5470. No ho der of any claim a ainst an estate
shall maintain any action thereon unless t e claim is ﬁrst
presented to the executor or administrator except, in the fol
owing case: An action may be brought by any holder of a
mortgage or lien to enforce the same against the property
of the estate subject thereto, where al recourse against
any other property of the estate is expressly waived in the
complaint.
SEC. 5471. The time during which there shall be a. va
cancy in the administration, must not be included in any
limitations herein prescribed.
SEC. 5472. If an action is ending against the decedent
at the time of his death, the p aintiff must in like manner
present his claim to the executor or administrator for allow
aiice or rejection, authenticated as required in other cases;
and no recovery shall be had in the action unless proof be
made of the resentations required.
SEC. 547 . Whenever any claim is presented to an ex
ecutor or administrator, or to the Probate Judge, and he is
willing to allow the same in part, he must state in his in
dorsement the amount he is willin to allow. If the credi
tor refuse to acce t the amount a lowed in satisfaction of
his claim, he shal recover no costs in any action therefor,
brought against the executor or administrator, unless he re
covers a reater amount than that offered to be allowed.
SEC. 5 74. A judgment rendered against an executor or
administrator upon any claim for mone against the estate
of his testator or intestate, only establis es the claim in the
same manner, as if it had been allowed by the executor or ad
ministrator and the Probate Judge, and the judgment must be
that the executor or administrator pay in due course of ad
ministration the amount ascertaine to be due. A certiﬁed
transcript of the judgment must be ﬁled in the Probate
Court. No execution must issue upon such jud ment, nor
shall it create any lien upon the property of t e estate or
give to the judgment creditor any priority of payment.
SEC. 5475. When any judgment has been rendered for
or a ainst the testator intestate in his lifetime, no execution
shal issue thereon after his death, except as provided in
Part Second of this Code. A judgment against the dece
dent for the recovery of money, must be resented to the
executor or administrator like any other c aim. If execu
tion is actually levied upon any pro erty of the decedent
before his death, the same may be soi)d for the satisfaction
thereof; and the ofﬁcer making the sale must account to
the executor or administrator for any surplus in his hands.
A judgment creditor having a judgment which was ren
dered against the testator or intestate in his lifetime, may
redeem any real estate of the decedent from any sale under
foreclosure or execution in like mainier and with like effect,
as if the judgment debtor were still living.
SEC. 5476. A judgment rendered against a decedent,
dying after verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but be
fore judgment is rendered thereon. is not a lien on the real
property of the decedent, but is payable in due course of ad
ministration.
Ssc. 5477. If the executor or administrator doubts t_hc.
correctness of any claim presented to him, he may enter in
to an agreement, in writing, with the claimant, to refer the
matter in controversy to some disinterested person, to be ap
proved by the Probate Judge. Upon ﬁlin the agreement
and approval of the Probate Judge in the o ce of the Clerk
of the District Court for the county in which the letters
testamentary or of administration were granted, the Clerk
must, either in vacation or in term, enter a minute of the
order referring the matter in controversy to the person so
selected; or, if the parties consent, a reference may be had
in the Probate Court; and the report of the referee. if con
ﬁrmed, establishes or rejects the claim, the same as if it had
been allowed or rejected by the executor, or administrator
and the Probate Judge.
SEC. 5478. The referee must hear and determine the
matter, and make his report thereon to the court in which
his appointment is entered. The same proceedings shall be
had in all respects, and the referee shall have the same
powers, be entitled to the same compensation and subject to
the same control, as in other cases of reference. The court
ma remove the referee, appoint another in his place, Set
asi e or conﬁrm his report, and adjudge costs, as in actions
against executors or administrators, and the judgment of
the court thereon, shall be as valid and effectual. in all re
spects as if the same had been rendered in asuit commenced
by ordinary process.
SEC. 5479. When a judgment is recovered, with costs.
a ainst any executor or administrator, he shall be individu
a ly liable for such costs, but they must be allowed him in
his administration accounts, unless it appears that the suit
or proceeding in which the costs were taxed was prosecuted
or c efended without just cause.
SEC. 5480. If the executor or administrator isa creditor
of the decedent, his claim, duly authenticated by aﬁidavits.
must be presented for allowance or rejection to the Probate
Judge, and its allowance by the Jud e is sufﬁcient evidence
of its correctness, and it must be pai as other claims, in due
course of administration. If, however, the Probate Judge
rejects the claim, action thereon may be had against the es
tate by the claimant, and summons must be served upon the
Probate Judge, who may appoint an attorney at the ex
pense of the estate, to defend the action. If the claimant
recovers no judgment, he must p_ay all costs, including de
fendant’s attorney’s fees.
SEC. 5481. If an executor or administrator neglects for
two months after his a pointment to give notice to creditors,
as prescribed by this chapter, the court must revoke his let
ters, and appoint some other erson in his stead, equally or
the next in order entitled to t e appointment.
SEC. 5482. At the same term at which he is required to
return his inventory, the executor or administrator must
also return a statement of all claims against the estate
which have been presented to him, if so required by the
court; and from term to term thereafter he must present a
statement of claims subsequently presented to him. In all
statements he must designate the names of the creditors,
the nature of each claim, when it becomes due or will be
come due, and whether it was allowed or rejected by him.
SEC. 5483. If there be any debt of the decedent bearing
interest, whether resented or not, the executor or adminis
trator ma , by or er of the court, pay the amount then ac
cumulate and un aid, or any part thereof, at any time
when there are su cient funds properly applicable thereto,
whether said claim be then due or not; and interest shall
thereupon cease to accrue upon the amount so paid. This section does not applly to existing debts, unless the creditor
consent to accept t e amount.

SECTION 5490. I The personal estate of the decedent which
comes into the hands of the executor or administrator is ﬁrst
chargeable with the p_a ment of the debts and expenses; if
the goods, chattels. rig ts, and cred1ts_in the hands of the
executor or administrator are not sufficient t_o pay the debts
of the decedent, the expenses of administration. and the al
lowance to the family, the whole of the real estate may be
sold for that purpose by the executor or administrator.
SEC. 5491. No sale of any pro erty of an estate of a de
cedent is valid unless made un er order of the Probate
Court, exce t as otherwise provided in this chapter. All
sales must e reported under oath, and conﬁrmed by the
Probate Court, before the title of the property sold passes.
SEC. 5492. All etitions for orders of sale must be in
writing, setting fort the facts showing the sale to be nec
essary, and, upon the hearing, any person interested in the
estate may ﬁle his written objections which must be heard
and determined. A failure to set forth the facts showing
the sale to be necessary will not invalidate the subsequent
proceedings, if the defect be supplied by the proofs at the
earing, and the general facts showing the necessity be
stated in the order directing the sale.
SEC. 5493, When it appears to the court that the estate
is insolvent, or that it will require a sale of all the pro erty
of the estate, of every character, to pay the family a low
ance, expenses of administration, and debts, there need be
but one petition ﬁled, but one order of sale made, and but
one sale had, except in the case of perishable property,
which may be sold as provided in the next section. The
Probate Court, when a etition for the sale of any property,
for any of the purposes ierein named, is presented, must in
quire fully into the probable amount required to make all
such payments, and if there be no more estate than suﬂi
cient to pay the same, may re uire but one proceeding for
the sale of the entire estate. n such case the petition must
set forth substantially the facts required in a petition for
the sale of real estate.
SEC. 5494. At any time after receiving letters the exec
utor, administrator, or special administrator, may apply to
the court or Judge and 0 tain an order to sell perisha e and
other personal property likely to depreciate in value, or
which will incur loss or expense by being kept, and so much
other personal pro erty as may be necessary to pay the al
lowance made to t e family of the decedent. The order for
the sale may be made without notice; but the executor, ad
ministrator, or special administrator is responsible for the
property, unless, after making a sworn return, and on a
proper showing, the court shal approve the sale.
SEC. 5495. If claims against the estate have been al
lowed and a sale of property is necessary for their payment
or the expense of administration, the executor, or adminis
trator may apply for an order to sell so much of the person
al property as may be necessary therefor. Upon ﬁlin his
etition, notice of at least ﬁve da s must be given o the
earing of the application, either y posting notices or by
advertising. He may also make a similar application, eith
er in vacation or term, from time to time, so lon as any
personal property remains in his hands and sale t ereof is
necessary. f it is made to appear for the best interests of
the estate, he may at any time after ﬁling the inventor , in
like manner and after giving like notice, apply for an ob
tain an order to sell the whole of the personal groperty be
longing to the estate, whether necessary to pay ebts or not.
SEC. 5496. Partnership interests or interests belong
ing to any estate by virtue of any partnership formerly ex
istmg, interest in personal property pledged, and choses in
lished at least four successive weeks in such newspaper as
the court or Judge shall direct.
The notice is served if the publication is completed ﬁve
days before the day set for hearing. If all persons inter
ested in the estate join in the petition for the sale, or signify
in vlvlriting their assent thereto, the notice may be dispensed
wit . .
SEC. 5508. The Probate Court, at the time and place
appointed in such order, or at such other time to which the
hearing may be postponed, upon satisfactory(proof of per
sonal service or publication of a copy of the or er, by aﬂida
vit or otherwise, if the consent in writing to such sale of all
parties interested is not ﬁled, must roceed to hear the eti
tion, and hear and examine the a legations and proo s of
the petitioners, and of all persons interested in the estate
who ma op ose the application.
SEC. 50 . The executor, administrator and witnesses
may be examined on oath by either party, and process to
compel them to attend and testify ma be issued by the
Probate Judge, in the same manner an with like effect as
in other cases. .
SEC. 5510. If it appears necessary to sell a part of the
real estate, and that by a sale thereof the residue of the es
tate, real or personal, or some s eciﬁc part thereof, would
be greatly injured or diminishe in value, or subjected to
ex ense, or rendered unproﬁtable, or that after an such
sa e the residue would be so small in uantity or v ue, or
would be of such a character with re erence to its future
disposition among the heirs or devisees, as clearly to render
it for the best interests of all concerned that the same should
be sold, the court ma authorize the sale of the whole estate
or of any part thereo , necessary and for the best interest of
all concerned.‘
SEC. 5511. If the court is satisﬁed, after a full hearing
upon the tpetition and an examination of the proofs and alle
gations o the parties interested, that a sale of the whole or
some portion of the real estate is necessary for any of the
causes mentioned in this chapter, or if such sale be assented
to by all the ersons interested, "an order must be made to
sell the who e, or so much and such parts of the reales
tate described in the petition as the court shall judge neces
sary or beneﬁcial.
SEC. 5512. The order of the sale must describe the lands
to be sold and the terms of sale, which ma be for cash or
on a credit not exceeding one year, payab e in gross or in
installments, and in such kind of money, with interest, as
the court may direct. The land may be sold in one parcel
or in subdivisions as the executor or administrator shall
judge most beneﬁcial to the estate, unless the court other
wise specially directs.
If it appears that any part of such real estate has been de
vised an not char ed in such devise with the payment of
debts or legacies, t 1e court must order the remainder to be
sold before that so devised. Every such sale must be or
dered to be made at public auction unless, in the opinion of
the court, it would beneﬁt the estate to sell the whole or
some part of such real estate at private sale; the court may,
if the same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such
real estate or any part thereof, to be sold at either public or
private sale as the executor or administrator shall judge to
e most beneﬁcial for the estate.
If the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to
make a sale under the order and as directed therein, he may
be compelled to sell by order of the court, made on motioif
-after due notice, by any party interested.
SEC. 5513. If the executor or administrator neglects to
apply for an order of sale when it is necessary, any erson
interested in the estate may make ap lication there or, in
the same manner as the executor or a ministrator, and no
tice thereof must be given to the executor or administrator
before the hearing. The petition of such applicant must
contain as many of the matters required in petitions of exe
cutors and administrators as he can ascertain, and the de
cree of sale must ﬁx the period of time within which the ex
ecutor or administrator must make the sale.
SEC. 5514. Upon makin the order mentioned in the
last section, a certiﬁed copy o ' the order of sale mu st be de
livered by the court or the Clerk to the executor or adminis
trator, w o is thereupon authorized and required to sell the
real estate as directed.
SEC. 5515. Whena sale is ordered, and is to be made at
public auction, notice of the time and place of sale must be
posted in three of the most public places in the county in
which the land is situated, and published in a newspaper, if
there be one printed in the same county, but if more, then
in such paper as the court may direct, for three weeks suc
cessively next before the sale. The lands and tenements to
be sold must be described with common certainty in the
notice.
SEC. 5516. Sales at public auction must be made in the
county where the land is situated5 but when the land is sit
uated in two or more counties, it may be sold in either.
The sale must be made between the hours of nine o’clook in
the morning and the setting of the sun on the same day,
and must be made on the day named in the notice of sale,
unless the same is postponed.
SEC. 5517. When a sale of real estate is ordered to be
made at private sale, notice of the same must be posted u
in three of the most public laces in the county in whic
the land is situated, and pub ished in a newspa er, if there
be one printed in the same county—if none, t en in such
paper as the court may direct—for two weeks successively
next before the day-on or after which the sale is to be made,
in which the lands and tenements to be sold must be de
scribed with common certainty. The notice must state a
day on or after which the sale will be made, and a place
where offers or bids will be received. The day last referred
to must be at least ﬁfteen days from the ﬁrst publication of
notice, and the sale must not be made before that day, but
must be made within six months thereafter. The bids or
offers must be in writing, and may be left at the place
designated in the notice, or deliver to the executor or
administrator ersonally, or may be ﬁled in the office of the
Clerk of the robate Court, to which the return of sale
must be made, at an time after the ﬁrst publication of the
notice, and before t e making of the sale. If it is shown
that it will be for the best interest of the estate, the court
or judge may, by an order, shorten the time of notice,
which shall not, however, be less than one week, and may
provide that the sale may be made on or after a day less
than ﬁfteen, but not less than eight days from the ﬁrst pub
lication of the notice, in which case the notice of sale and
the sale may be made to corres ond with such order.
SEC. 5518. No sale of rea estate at private sale shall
be conﬁrmed by the court unless the sum offered is at least
ninety per cent of the appraised value thereof, nor unless
such real estate has been appraised, within one year of the
time of such sale. If it has not been so appraised, or -if the
court is satisﬁed that the appraisement is too high or too
low, appraisers must be a%pOll1t8d and they must make an
appraiseinent thereof in t e same manner as in case of an
original agpraisement of an estate. This may be done at
any time efore the sale or the conﬁrmation thereof.
SEC. 5519. The executor or administrator must, when
the sale is made upon a credit, take the notes of the pur
chaser for the purchase money, with a mortgage on the
property to secure their payment.
SEC. 5520. The executor or administrator, after Hlﬂkiéldg
any sale of real estate, must make a return of his proce -
ings to the court, which must be ﬁled in the oﬂice of the
Clerk at any time subse uent to the sale. A hearing upon
the return of the rocee ings may be asked for in the return
or by petition su sequently, and thereupon the court or
Judge must ﬁx the da for the hearing, of which notice of
at least ten days must be given by the Llerk by notices post
ed in three public places in the county, or by publication in
a newspaper, or both, as the court or Judge shall direct, and
must brieﬂy indicate the land sold, the sum for which it
was sold, and must refer to the return for further particulars.
Upon the hearing, the court must examine the return and
witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings were
unfair, or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and if
it a pear that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per cent,
exc usive of the expenses of a new sale, may be obtained,
the court may vacate the sale and direct another to be had,
of which notice must be given, and the sale in all respects
conducted as if no previous sale had taken place: if an offer
of ten per cent more in amount than that named in the re
turn be made to the court in writing by a. responsible per
son it is in the discretion of the court to accept such offer
and conﬁrm the sale to such person, or to order a new sale.
SEC. 5521. When return of the sale is made and ﬁled,
any person interested in the estate may ﬁle written objec
tions to the conﬁrmation thereof and may be heard thereon
when the return is heard by the court or Judge, and may
produce witnesses in support of his objections.
SEC. 5522. If it appears to the court that the sale was
legally made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was
not disproportionate to the value of the property sold, and
that a greater sum, as above speciﬁed, cannot be obtained,
or if the increased bid before mentioned be made and ac
cepted by the court, the court must make an order conﬁrm
ing the sale. and directing conveyances to be executed.
The sale, from that time. is conﬁrmed and valid, and a cer
tiﬁed cop of the order conﬁrming it and directing convey
ances to e executed must be recorded in the oﬁice of the
Recorder of the County within which the land sold is sit
uated. If, after the conﬁrmation, the purchaser neglects or
refuses to comply with the terms of sale, the court may, on
motion of the executor or administrator. and after notice to
the purchaser, order a re-sale to be made of the property. If
the amount realized on such re-sale does not cover the bid
and the expenses of previous sale, such purchaser is liable

cord of the order of conﬁrmation in the ofﬁce of the County
Recorder, either by the date of such recording, or by the
date, volume, and pa e of the record, and such reference
shall have the same e ect as if the orders were, at large, in
serted in the conveyance. Conveyances so made convey all
the right, title, interest, and estate of the decedent, in the
premises, at the time of his death; if, prior to the sale, by
operation of law or otherwise, the estate has acquired aiiv
right, title, or interest in the premises, other than, or in ad
dition to, that of the decedent at the time of his death,
such right, title, or interest also passes by such conveyances.
SEC. 5524. Before any order is entered conﬁrming the
sale, it must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that
notice was given of the sale as prescribed, and the order of
conﬁrmation must show that such proof was made.
SEC. 5525. If at the time appointed for the sale, the
executor or administrator deems it for the interest of all
persons concerned therein that the same be postponed. he

must be given, by a public dec aration, at the time and place
ﬁrst appointed for the sale, and if the postponement be for
more than one day, further notice must be given, by post
ing notices in three or more public places in the county
where the land is situated, or publishing the same, or both,
as the time and circumstances will admit.
SEC. 5527. If the testator makes provisions by his will,
or desi nates the estate to be a propriated for the payment
of his gebts, the expenses of adlministration, or family ex
genses, they must e paid according to such provision or
esignation, out of the estate thus appropriated, so far as
the same is sufficient.
SEC. 5528. When property is directed by the will to be
sold, or authority is given in the will to sell property, the
executor may sell any roperty of the estate without order
of the court, and at eit er public or private sale, and with
or without notice, as the executor may determine; but the
executor must make return of such sales as in other cases;
and if directions are given in the will as to the mode of
sellin , or the particular roperty to be sold, such directions
must %e observed. In eit er case, no title passes unless the
ale be conﬁrmed by the court.
SEC. 5542. When a sale has been made by an executor
or administrator of any property of the estate, real or per
sonal, he must return to the Probate Court, at its next term
thereafter, an account of sales, veriﬁed by his afﬁdavit. If
he neglects to make such return, he may e punished by at
tachment, or his letters may be revoked, one day’s notice
having been ﬁrst given him to appear and show cause why
such attachment should not issue, or such revocation
should not be made. .
SEC. 5543. No executor or administrator must, directly
or indirectly, purchase any pro erty of the estate he repre
sents, nor must he be intereste in any sale.

from the District Court. The executor or administrator is
liable therefor, on his bond, to each creditor.
SEC. 5613. When the accounts of the administrator or
executor have been settled, and an order made for the ay
ment of debts and distribution of the estate, no cre itor
whose claim was not included in the order for payment has
any ri ht to call upon the creditors who have been paid, or
upon t e heirs, devisees, or legatees to contribute to the pay
ment of his claim ; but if the executor or administrator has

with security, for the payment of his proportion of t e debts
of the estate.
SEC. 5622. Notice of the application must be given to

interested in the estate, may ap ear at the time named and

is but little indebted and that the share of the party apply
ing may be allowed to him without loss to the creditors of
the estate, the court must make an order in conformity with
the prayer of the applicant, requiring:
1. Each heir, legatee, or devisee obtaining such order be
fore receiving his share or any ortion thereof, to execute
and deliver to the executor or a ministrator a bond, in such
sum as shall be designated by the Probate Judge, with sure
ties to be approved by the Jud e, pa able to the executor or
administrator, and conditione for t e ayment, whenever
required, of his proportion of the debts d)ue from the estate,

legatee or devisee the whole portion of the estate to which
he may be entitled, or only apart thereof, designating it. If

in the manner hereinafter prescribed. The costs of these
proceedings shall be paid by the applicant, or- if there
e more than one, to be apportioned equally amongst them.
SEC. 5625. When any bond has been executed and de
livered under the provisions of the receding section, and
it is necessary for the settlement of tiie estate to require the
payment of any part of the money thereby secured, the ex
ecutor or administrator must petition the court for an order
requiring the payment and have a citation issued and served
on the party bound, requiring him to ap ear and show cause
why the order should not be made. t the hearing, the
court, if satisﬁed of‘ the necessity of such payment, must
make an order accordingly, designating the amount and
giving a time within which it must be paid. If the money
is notdpaid within the time allowed, an action may be main
taine by the executor or administrator on the bond.
SEC. 5626. Upon the ﬁnal settlement of the accounts
of the executor or administrator, or at an subsequent time,

or administrator, if any, among the persons wlio bylaw are
entitled thereto; and if the decedent has left a surviving
child and the issue of other children, and an
fore the close of administration, have died wliile under age
and not havin been married, no administration on such
deceased chil s estate is necessary, but all the estate which
such deceased child was entitled to by inheritance, must,
without administration, be distributed to the other heirs at
law. A statement of any receipts and disbursements of the
executor or administrator, since the rendition of his ﬁnal
accounts, must be reported and ﬁled at the time of making
such distribution, and a settlement thereof, together wit
an estimate of the expenses of closin the estate, must be
made by the court and included in t e order or decree; or
the court or Judge may order notice of the settlement of
such supplementary account, and refer the same as in oth
er cases of the settlement of accounts.
SEC. 5627. In the order or decree the court must name
the persons and the proportions or arts to which each shall
be entitled, and such persons may emand and sue for, and
recover their respective shares from the executor or admin
istrator, or any person having the same in possession. Such
order or decree is conclusive as to the rights of heirs, lega
tees or devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, or
modiﬁed on appeal.
SEC. 5628. Upon application for distribution, after ﬁnal
settlement of the accounts of administration, if the dece
of them,be-
dent was a non-resident of this Territory, leaving a will
which has been duly proved or allowed in the state of his
residence, and an authenticated copy thereof has been ad
mitted to probate in this Territory, and it is necessary, in
order that the estate or any part thereof may be distributed
according to the will, that the estate in this Territory should
be delivered to the executor or administrator in the state or
place of his residence, the court may order such delivery to
e made, and if necessary, order a sale of the real estate,
and a. like deliver of the proceeds. The delivery, in accord
ance with the or er of the court, is a full discharge of the
executor or administrator with the will annexed, in this
Territory, in relation to all property embraced in such order
which, unless recovered on appeal, binds and concludes all
parties in interest. Sales of real estate ordered by virtue of
this section, must be made in the same manner as other
raales of real estate of decedents by order of the Probate
ourt. -
SEC. 5629. The order or decree may be made on the pe
tition of the executor or administrator, or of any person in
terested in the estate. Notice of the application must be
given by posting or publication, as the court may direct,
and for such time as may be ordered. If partition be applied
for as provided in this cha ter, the decree of distribution
shall not divest the court 0 jurisdiction to order partition,
unless the estate is ﬁnally closed.
SEC. 5630. Before any decree of distribution of an es
tate is made, the Probate Court must be satisﬁed, by the
oath of the executor or administrator, or otherwise, that all
Territorial, county and municipal taxes, le ally levied upon
personal ro ertarof the estate, have been ully aid.
SEC. 5 3f. hen the estate, real or persona , assigned
by the decree of distribution to two or more heirs, devisees
or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respective
shares are not separated and distinguished, partition or dis
tribution may be made by three disinterested persons, to be
a pointed commissioners for that purpose by the Probate
ourt or Judge, who must be duly sworn to the faithful dis
charge of their duties. A certiﬁed copy of the order of their
ap ointment, and of the order or decree assignin and dis
tri utin the estate, must be issued to them as t eir war
rant, an their oath must be indorsed thereon. Upon con
sent of the parties, or when the court deems it pro er and
'ust, it is suﬂicient to appoint one commissioner on y, who
as the same authority and is governed by the same rules
as if three were appointed.
SEC. 5632. Such partition may be ordered and had in
the Probate Court, on the petition of any person interested.
But before commissioners are appointed, or partition or
dered by the Probate Court, as directed in this chapter, no
tice thereof must be given to all persons interested, who re
side in this Territory, or to their guardians, and to the
agents, attorneys, or ardians, if any in this Territory, of
such as reside out of t e Territory, either ersonall or by
public notice, as the Probate Court may irect. T e peti
tion may be ﬁled, attorneys, guardians, and agents ap
pointed, and notice given, at an time before the order or
ecree of distribution, but the ommissioners must not be
appointed until the order or decree is made distributing the
estate.
SEC. 5633. If the real estate is in different counties, the
Probate Court may, if deemed proper, ap oint a Commis
sioner for all, or different Commissioners or each county.
The estate in each county must be divided separately among
the heirs, devisees, or legatees, as if there was no other es
tate to be divided, but the Commissioner ﬁrst appointed
must, unless otherwise directed by the Probate Court, make division of such real estate, wherever situated within this
Territor .
SEC. 634. Partition or distribution of the real estate
may be made as provided in this chapter, although some of
the ori "nal heirs, legatees, or devisees may have conveyed
their s ares to other ersons, and such shares must be as
signed to the person olding the same, in the same manner
as they otherwise would have been -to such heirs, legatees,
or devisees. -
SEC. 5635. When both distribution and partition are
made, the several shares in the real and personal estate must
be set out to each individual in proportion to his right, by
metes and bounds, or description, so that the same can be
easil distinguished, unless two or more of the parties inter
este consent to have their shares set out so as to be held by
them in common and undivided.
SEC. 5636. When the real estate cannot be divided
without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the Pro
bate Court may assign'the whole to one or more of the par
ties entitled to share therein who will accept it, always pre
ferring the males to the females, and among children pre
ferring the elder to the younger. The parties acce ting the
whole must pal}; to the other arties interested, t eir just
proportion o t e true value t ereof, or secure the same to
their satisfaction, or, in case of the minority of such party,
then to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true value
of the estate must be ascertained and reported by the Com
missioners. When the Commissioners a pointed to make
partition are of the opinion that the rea estate cannot be
divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners,
they must so report to the court, and recommend that the
whole be assigned as herein provided, and must ﬁnd and re
port the true value of such real estate. On ﬁling the report
of the Commissioners, and on making or securing the pay
ment as before provided, the court, if it appears just and
proper, must conﬁrm the re ort, and thereupon the assign
ment is complete and the tit e to the whole of such real es
tate vests in the erson to whom the same is so assigned.
SEC. 5637. X hen any tract of land or tenement is of
greater value than any one’s share in the estate to be divided,
and cannot be divided without injury to the same, it may
be set off by the commissioners appointed to make partition,
to any of the parties who will accept it, iving preference
as prescribed in the preceding section. he party accept
ing must pay; or secure to the others such sums as the com
missioners s all award to make the partition equal, and the
commissioners must make their award accordingly; but
partition must not be established by the court until the
sums awarded are paid to the parties entitled to the same,
or secured to their satisfaction.
SEC. 5638. When it appears to the court, from the com
missioners’ report, that it cannot otherwise be fairly divided,
and should be sold, the court may order the sale of the
whole or any part of the estate, real or personal, by the ex
ecutor or administrator, or by a commissioner appointed
for that purpose, and the proceeds distributed. e sale
must be conducted, reported, and conﬁrmed in the same
manner and under the same requirements provided in
Chapter VII of this Title. _ _ _
_Si§o. 5639. Before any partition is made or any estate
divided, as provided in this chapter, notice must be iven
to all persons interested in the partition, their guar ians,
ents, or attorneys, by the commissioners, of the time and
p ace, when and where they shall proceed to make parti
tion. The commissioners may take testimony, order sur
veys, and take such other steps as may be necessary to en
ab e them to form a judgment upon the matters before them.
SE_c. 5640. The commissioners must report their pro
ceedings, and the partition agreed upon by them, to the
Probate Court, in writing, and the court may, for sufﬁcient
reasons, set aside the report and commit the same to the
same commissioners, or appoint others; and when such re
port is ﬁnally conﬁrmed, a certiﬁed copy of the judgment
or decree of partition made thereon, attested by the clerk,
under the seal of the court, must be recorded in the oﬂ‘ice_of
the recorder of the county where the lands lie.
SEC. 5641. VVhen the Probate Court makes a judgment
or decree assigning the residue of any estate to one or more
persons entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint
ommissioners to make partition or distribution thereo , un
lqspﬁzhe parties to lyvhom tilie assignmgnt is élecreed, or some
o eni, request t at suc partition ema e.
SEC. 5642. All questions as to advancements made, or
alleged to have been made, by the decedent, to his heirs,
may be heard and determined by the Probate Court, and
must be speciﬁed in the decree assigning and distributing
the estate; and the ﬁnal judgment, or decree of the Probate
Court, or, in case of appeal, of the District or Supreme
Court, is binding on all parties interested in the estate.
SEC. 5643. Vhen any estate is assigned or distributed
bl); a judgment or decree of the court, as rovided in this
c apter, to any person residing out of and liaving an agent
in this Territory, and it is -necessary that some person
should be authorized to take ossession and charge of the
same for the beneﬁt of such a sent person, the court may
ap oint an agent for that purpose, and authorize him to
ta e chargﬁ ogsucltestate as well as to act for such absent
person in t e istri ution.
SEC. 5644. The agent must ﬁrst give a bond to the Pro
bate Jud e, to be approved by him, conditioned that he
shall fait fully manage and account for the estate. The
court approvin such agent may allow a reasonable sum out
of the proﬁts 0 the estate for his services and expenses.
SEC. 5645. When ersonal property remains in the
hands of the agent unc aimed for a ear, and it appears to
the court that it is for the beneﬁt of t ose interested, it shall
be sold under the order of the court; and the proceeds, after
deducting the ex enses of the sale allowed by the court, must
be paid into the erritorial Treasury. When the ayment

county jail, there to remain in close custody until he sub
mits to the order of the court.
SEC. 5690. The Probate Court may at any time, order
the Public Administrator to account for and deliver all the

with it, and the amount of his fees and expenses incurred,
and the balance, if any, remaining in his hands.

SEC. 5701. The property both real and personal, of one
who dies without disposing of it by will, passes to the heirs
of the intestate, subject to the control of the Probate Court,
and to the ossession of any administrator appointed by that
court for t e puiggroses of administration.
Si:c.- 5702. hen any_ person having title to any estate
not otherwise limited by marriage contract, dies without
disposin of the estate b Will, it is succeeded to and must
be distri uted, unless ot erwise expressly provided in this
Code, subject to the payment of his debts, in the following
manner: it

to the survivin husband or wife and child, or issue of such
child. If the ecedent leave a survivin husband or wife.
and more than one child living, or one'c lild living and the
lawful issue of one or more deceased children, one-third to
the surviving husband or wife, and the remainder in equal
shares to his children and to the lawful issue of any deceased
child by right of representation- but if there be no child of
the decedent living at his death, the remainder goes to all
of his lineal descendants; and if all the descendants are in
the same degree of kindred to the decedent, they share
equally, otherwise they take according to the right of rep
resentation. If the decedent leave no surviving husband or
wife, but leave issue, the whole estate goes to such issue;
and if such issue consists of more than one child living, or
one child living and the lawful issue of one or more deceased
children, then the estate goes in equal shares to the children
living or to the child living, and the issue of the deceased
child or children by right of representation.
2. If the decedent leave no issue, the estate goes, one-half
to the surviving husband or wife, and the other half to the
decedent’s father and mother in equal shares, and if either
be dead, the whole of said half oes to the other; if there be
no father or mother, then one- alf goes in equal shares to
the brothers and sisters of the decedent, and to the children
of any deceased brother or sister by ri ht of representa
tion. If the decedent leave no issue, nor usband, nor wife,
the estate must go to his father and mother, in equal shares,
or if either be dead, then to the other.
3. If there be neither issue, husband, wife, father, nor
mother, then in equal shares to the brothers and sisters of
the decedent, and to the children of any deceased brother or
sister by right of representation.
4. If the decedent leaves a survivin husband or wife,
and neither issue, father, mother, brot er, nor sister, the
whole estate oes to the survivin husband or wife.
5. If the ecedent leave neit er issue, husband, wife,
father, mother, brother, nor sister, the estate must go to
the next of kin in equal degree, excelpting that when there
are two or more collateral kindre in equal de ee, but
claiming through different ancestors, those w 0 claim
through the nearest ancestors must be preferred’ to those
claiming through an ancestor more remote.
6. If the decedent leave several children, or one child
and the issue of one or more children, and any such surviv~
ing child dies under age, and not having been married, all
the estate that came to the deceased chlld by inheritance
from such decedent descends in equal shares to the other
children of the same parent, and to the issue of any such
other children who are dead, by right of representation.
7. If at the death of such child, who dies under age, not
having been married, all the other children of his parents,
are also dead, and any of them'have left issue, the estate
that came to such child by inheritance from his parents
descends to the issue of all other children of the same ar
ent; and if all the issues are in the same degree of kin red
to the child, they share the estate equally, otherwise they
take according to the right of representation.
8. If the decedent be a widow or widower, and leave no
kindred, and the estate, or any portion thereof, was com
mon property of such decedent, and his or her deceased
spouse, while such spouse was living, such common prop
erty shall go to the father of such deceased spouse, or if he
be dead, to the mother. If there be no father nor mother,
then such property shall go to the brothers and sisters of
such deceased spouse, in equal shares, and to the lawful
issue of any deceased brother or sister of such deceased
spouse, by right of representation.
9. If the ecedent leave no husband, wife, or kindred,
and there be no heirs to take his estate, or any portion
thereof, under subdivision eight, of this section, the same
shall be paid into the Territorial Treasury for the support
of common schools. _ _
SEC. 5703. Every illegitimate child is an heir of the
person who, in writing, signed in the presence of a compe
tent witness, acknowledges himself to be the father of such
child; and in all cases is an heir of his mother; and inher
its his or her estate, in whole or in part as the case may be,
in the same manner as if he had been born in lawful wed
lock, but he does not represent his father or mother by in
heriting an part of the estate of his or her kindred, either
lineal or co lateral, unless before his death, his parents shall
have intermarried, and his father, after such marriage, ac
knowledges him as his child or adopts him into his family;
in which case such child and all the legitimate children are
considered brothers and sisters, and on the death of either
of them, intestate and without issue, the others inherit his
estate and are heirs as hereinbefore provided, in like man
ner as if all the children had been legitimate; saving to the
father and mother respectively, their ri hts in the estates
of all the children in like manner as if a had been legiti
mate. The issue of all marriages null in law, or dissolved
by divorce, are legitimate.
SEC. 5704. If an illegitimate child who has not been ac
knowledged or adopted by his father, dies intestate without
lawful issue, his estate goes to his mother, or in case of her
decease, to her heirs at law.
SEC. 5705. The decrees of kindred are com leted ac
cording to the rules of the civil law. Kindred o the half
blood inherit equally with those of the whole blood in the
same degree, unless the inheritance come to the intestate b
descent, devise or gift of some one of his ancestors, in whic
case all those who are not of the blood of such ancestors
must be excluded from such inheritance.
SEC. 5706. Any estate, real or personal, given by the
decedent in his lifetime, as an advancement to any child or
other lineal descendant, is a part of the estate of the dece
dent for the purpose of division and distribution thereof
among his issue, and must be taken b such child, or other
lineal descendant, toward his share o the estate of the de
cedent.
SEC. 5707. If the amount of such advancement exceeds
the share of the heir receiving the same, he must be exclud
ed from any further portion in the division and distribution
of the estate, but he must not be required to refund any
part of such advancement; and if the amount so received is
less than his share, he is entitled to so much more as will
give him his full share of the estate of the decedent.
Snc. 5708. All gifts and grants are made as advance
ments, if expressed 1n the gift or grant to be so made, or if
charged in writing by the decedent as an advancement, or
acknowledged in writing as such by the child or other suc
cessor or heir.
SEC. 5709. If the value of the estate so advanced is ex
grossed in the conveyance, or in the charge thereof made
y the decedent, or in the acknowledgment of the party re
ceiving it, it must be held as of that value in the division
and distribution of the estate; otherwise it must be estimat
ed according to its value when given, as nearly as the same
can be ascertained.
SEC. 5710. If any child or other lineal descendant re
ceivin advancement dies before the decedent leaving issue,
the a vancement must be taken into consideration in the division and distribution of the estate, and the amount there
of, must be allowed accordingly by the re resentatives of
the heirs receiving the advancement, in li e manner as if
the advancement had been made directly to them.
SEC. 571 1. The provisions of the precedin sections
of this chapter, as to the inheritance of the hus and and
wife from each other, apply only to the separate property of
the decedents.
SEC. 5712. Upon the death of the wife, the entire com
munity property, without administration, belon s to the
survivlng husband, except such portion thereo as may
have been set apart to her, by judicial decree, for her sup
port and maintenance, which portion is subject to her tes
tamentary disposition, and in the absence of such dis osi
Eiona goes to her descendants, or heirs, exclusive of her us
an .
SEC. 5713. Upon the death of the husband, one-half of
the community property goes to the surviving wife, and the
other half is subject to t e testamentary disposition of .the
husband, and in the absence of such disposition, goes to his
descendants, e uall , if such descendants are in the same de
gree of kindre to t e decedent; otherwise, accordin to the
right of representation; and in the absence of bot such
dis osition and such descendants, is subject to distribution.
in t e same manner as the se arate property of the husband.
In case of the dissolution of t e community by the death of
the husband, the entire community property is equally sub
ject to his debts, the family allowance, and the charges and
ex enses of administration.
so. 5714. Inheritance or succession “by right of rep
resentation” takes place when the descendants of any de
ceased heir take the same share or ri ht in the estate of an
other person that their parents woul have taken if livin .
Posthumous children are considered as living at the deat 1
of their arents. ,
SEC. 715. Resident aliens may take in all cases by
succession as citizens; and no person capable of succeedin
under the rovisions of this itle is precluded from suc
succession ﬂy reason of the alienage of any relative; but no
non-resident foreigner, can take, by succession, unless he
appears and claims such succession within ﬁve years after
the death of the decedent to whom he claims succession.
SEC. 5716. When succession is not claimed as provided
in the receding section, the District Court, on information,
must irect the Attorney General to reduce the property to
his or the possession of the Territory, or to cause the same
to be sold, and the same, or the proceeds thereof, to be de
posited in the Territorial Treasury for the beneﬁt of such
non-resident foreigner, or his legal representative, to be
paid to him whenever, within ﬁve ears after such deposit
roof to the satisfaction of the erritorial Controller and
reasurer, is produced that he is entitled to succeed thereto.
SEC. 5717. When so claimed, the evidence and the
joint order of the Controller and Treasurer, must be ﬁled by
the Treasurer as his voucher, and the property delivered or
the proceeds paid to the claimant on ﬁ ing his receipt there
for. If no one succeeds to the estate or the proceeds, as
herein provided, the property of the decedent IS placed by
the Territorial Treasurer, to the credit of the school fund.

SECTION 5725. Every person over the age of eighteen
years, of sound mind, may, by last will, dispose of all his
estate, real and (personal, and such estate not disposed of by
will is succeede to as provided in Cha ter XIV of this Title,
bein char eable in both cases with t epayment of all the
dece ent’s ebts, as provided in this Code.
SEC. 5726. A married woman may dispose of all her
separate estate by will, without the consent of her husband,
and may alter or revoke the will in like manner as if she
were single. Her will must be attested, witnessed, and
proved in like manner as all other wills.
SEC. 5727. Every will, other than a nuncupative will,
must be in writing, and every will, other than an olographic
will, and a nuncupative will, must be executed and attested
as follows:
1. It must be subscribed at the end thereof by the testa
tor himself, or some person in his presence and by his direc
tion must subscribe his name thereto;
2. The subscription must be made in the presence of the
attesting witnesses or be acknowledged by the testator to
them, to have been made by him or by his authority;
3. The testator must, at the time of subscribing or ac
knowledging the same, declare to the attesting witnesses
that the instrument is his will; and,
4. There must be two attesting witnesses, each of whom
must sign his name as a witness, at the end of the will, at
the testator’s request, and in his presence.
SEC. 5728. An olographic will is one that is entirely
written, dated and signed, by the hand of the testator him
self. It is subject to no other form, and may be made in or
out of this Territory, and need not be witnessed.
SEC. 5729. A witness to a written will must write,
with his name, his place of residence; and a person who
subscribes the testator’s name, by his direction, must write
his own name as a witness to the will. But a violation of
this section does not affect the validity of the will.
SEC. 5730. If the subscribing witnesses to a will are
competent at the time of attesting its execution, their sub
sequent incompetency, from whatever cause it may arise,
does not prevent the probate and allowance of the will, if it
is otherwise satisfactorily proved.
SEC. 5731. Exce t in the cases in this Chapter men
tioned, no written wi l, nor any part thereof, can be revoked
or altered otherwise than:
1. By a written will, or other writing of the testator, de
clarin such revocation or alteration, and executed with the
same ormalities with which a will should be executed by
such testator; or,
2. By being burnt, torn. canceled, obliterated, or de
stroyed, with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the
same, by the testator himself, or by some person in.his pre
sence and by his direction.
SEC. 5732. When a will is canceled or destroyed by any
other person than the testator, the direction of the testator,
and the fact of such injury or destruction, must be proved
by two witnesses.
SEC. 5733. The revocation of a will, executed in dupli
cate, may be made by revoking one of the duplicates.
Sac. 5734. If, after makin a will, the testator duly
makes and executes a second wi , the destruction, cancella
tion, or revocation of such second will does not revive the
ﬁrst will, unless it appears by the terms of such revocation
that it was the intention to revive and give effect to the ﬁrst
will, or unless, after such destruction, cancellation, or re
vocation, the ﬁrst will is duly republished.
SEC. 5735. If, after having made a will, the testator
marries, and has issue of such marriage, born either in his
lifetime or after his death, and the wife or issue survives
him, the will is revoked, unless provision has been made for
such issue by some settlement, or unless such issue are pro
vided for in the will, or in such way mentioned therein as
to show an intention not to make such provision; and no
other evidence to rebut the presumption of such revocation
can be received.
SEC. 5736. If, after making a will the testator marries,
and the wife survives the testator, the will is revoked, un
less provision has been made for her by marria e contract,
or unless she is provided for in the will, or in suc way men

vision; and no other evidence to rebut the presumption of
revocation must be received.

is revoked by her subsequent marriage, and is not revive
by the death of her husband.
Sec. 5738. An agreement made by a testator for the sale
or transfer of property dis osed of by a will previously
made, does not revoke such isposal; but the pro erty passes
the by will, subject to the same remedies on t e testator’s
agreement, for a speciﬁc performance or otherwise against
the devisees or le atees, as mi ht be had against the testa
tor’s successors, i the same ha passed by succession.
SEC. 5739. A charge or incumbrance u on any estate
for the purpose of securing the payment o money or the
performance of an covenant or agreement, is not a revoca
tion of any will re ating to the same estate which was pre
viously executed; but the devise and legacies therein con
tained must pass, subject to such charge or incumbrance.
SEC. 5740. A conveyance, settlement, or other act of a
testator, by which his interest in a thin reviously dis
posed of by his will is altered, but not w o ly divested, is
not a revocation; but the will passes the property which
would otherwise devolve by succession.
SEC. 5741. If the instrument by which an alteration is
made in the testator’s interest in a thing previously disposed
of by his will expresses his intent that it shall be a revoca
tion, or if it contains provisions wholly inconsistent with
the terms and nature of the testamentary disposition, it
operates as a revocation thereof, unless such inconsistent
provisions depend on a condition or contingency by reason
of which they do not take effect.
SEC. 5742. The revocation of a will revokes all its
codicils.
SEC. 5743. Whenever a testator has a child born after
the makin of his will, either in his lifetime or after his
death, an dies leaving such child unprovided for by any
provided for nor in any way men
-settlement, and neither
tioned inhis will, the c ild succeeds to the same portion
of the testator’s real and personal pro erty that he would
have succeeded to if the intestator had ied intestate.
SEC. 5744. When any testator omits to provide in his
will for any of his children, or for the issue of any deceased
child, unless it appears that such omission was intentional,
such child, or the issue of such child, must have the same
share in the estate of the testator as if he had died intestate,
and succeeds thereto as provided in the preceding section.
SEC. 5745. VVhen any share of the estate of a testator
is assi ned to a child born after the making of a will, or to
a chil , or the issue of a child omitted in the will, as herein
before mentioned, the same must ﬁrst be taken from the es
tate not disposed of by the will, if any; if that is not suffi
cient, so much as may be necessary must be taken from all
the devisees or legatees, in pro ortion to the value they
may respectively receive under t e will, unless the obvious
intention of the testator in relation to some speciﬁc devise
or bequest, or other provision in the will, would thereby be
defeated; in such case, such speciﬁc devise, legacy or pro
vision may be exempted from such apportionment, and a
diﬁerent apportionment, consistent with the intention of
the testator, ma be ado ted.
SEC. 5746. lf such o ildren, ortheir descendants, so un
provided for, had an equal proportion of the testator's es
tate bestowed on them in the testator’s lifetime, by way of
advancement, the take nothing in virtue of the provisions
of the three rece ing sections.
SEC. 574 . When any estate is devised to an child or
other relation of the testator, and the devisee dies efore the
testator, leaving lineal descendants, such descendants take
the estate so given by the will in the same manner as
the devisee would have done had he survived the testator.
SEC. 5748. Every devisee of land in any will conveys
all the estate of the devisor therein, which he could lawfully
devise, unless it clearly appears by the will that he intended
to conve a less estate.
SEC. 749. Any estate, right or interest in lands ac
uired by the testator after the makin of his will, passes
t ereby and in like manner as if the tit e thereto was vested
in him at the time of makin the will, unless the contrary
manifestly appears by the wil to have been the intention
of the testator. Every will made in express terms devising,
or in an other terms denoting the intent of the testator to
devise a the real estate of such testator, passes all the real
estate which-such testator was entitled to devise at the time
of his decease.
SEC. 5750. No estate, real or personal, shall be be
queathed or devised to any charitable or benevolent society
or corporation, or to any person or persons in trust for char
itable uses, except the same be done by will duly executed
at least thirty days before the decease of the testator; and
if so made, at least thirty days prior to such death, such de
vise or legacy, and each of- them shall be valid; Provided,
That no such devises or bequests shall collectively exceed
one-third of the estate of the testator leaving lineal descend
ants, and in such case, a pro rata deduction from such de
vises or beguests shall be made so as to reduce the aggre
gate thereo to one-third of such estate; and all dispositions
of property made contrary hereto shall be void, and go to
the residuary legatee or devisee next of kin, or heirs, accord
ing to law.

erty, real and personal, without any distinction between
them, is chargeable with the ayment of his debts, except

one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest
therein, and such agreement, if made by an agent of the
party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority
of the agent be in writing, subscribed by the party sought
to be char ed.

suant to such promise; or by one who has received a dis
charge from an obligation in whole or in part, in considera
tion of such promise
2. Where the creditor parts with value, or enters into an
obligation, in consideration of the obligations in respect to
which the promise is made, in terms or under circumstances
such as to render the party making the romise the rinci
pal debtor, and the person in whose be alf it is ma e, his
surety;
3. Where the promise, being for an antecedent obligation
of another, is made upon the consideration that the party
receiving it cancels the antecedent obligation, acceptin the
