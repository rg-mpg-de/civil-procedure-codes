may sue separately for his interest, and the judgment in such‘
case effects only himself. ‘

the initials of his christian name only, he may be sued in the
same way.

may in like manner be joined. The defendant may also set up
as a defence, all claims against the plaintiff of a similar nature
with the plaintiff’s demand.

§  3186. Courts will not in one suit take cognizance of distinct

case, sue separately.

is not void, and although the suit is defective in wanting a guardian or next. friend, the defect is a amendable before verdict, and

§ 3506. When a judgment has been rendered, either party
may move in arrest thereof, or to set it aside for any defect not
amendable which appears on the face of the record or pleadings.

§ 3507. A motion in arrest of judgment differs from a motion
for a new trial in this : the former must be predicated on some
defect which appears on the face of the record or pleadings,
while the latter must be predicated on some extrinsic matter not
so appearing. It also differs from a motion to set aside a judgment in this: the motion, in arrest of judgment, must be made
during the term at which such judgment was obtained, While a
motion to set it aside may be made at any time Within the statute of limitations.

§ 3508. If the pleadings are so defective that no legal judg—E
ment can be rendered, the judgment will be arrested or set aside. 11

which may have been obtained, or entered up, shall be set aside,j
and be of no effect if it shall appear that the same was entered
up in consequence of corrupt and willful perjury; and it shall
be the duty of the court, in which such verdict, judgment, rule
or order, was obtained or entered up, to cause the same to be set
aside, upon motion and notice to the adverse party ; but it shall
not be lawful for the said court to do so, unless the person
charged with such perjury shall have been thereof duly convicted,
and unless it shall appear to the said court, that the said verdict,
judgment, rule or order, could not have been obtained and entered up, without the evidence of such perjured person, saving
always to third persons, innocent of such perjury, the right
which they may lawfully have acquired under such verdict, judgment, rule or order, before the same shall have been actually vacated and set aside. .

§ 3511. All motions to arrest or set aside a judgment, mustbe
made to the court by whom such judgment was rendered, and of
which motion the opposite party must have reasOnable notice.

§ 3512. The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
cannot be collaterally attacked in any other court for irregularity, but shall be taken and held as a valid judgment until it is
reversed or set aside. “

§ 3513. The, judgment of a court having no jurisdiction of
the person and subject matter, or void for any other cause, is a
mere nullity, and may be so held in any court when it becomes
material to the interest of the parties to consider it. .

§ 3514. The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
may be set aside by a decree in Chancery, for fraud, accident, or.
mistake, or the acts of the adverse party unmixed with the negligence or fault of the complainant.

3671. Sundry definitions. l 3676. Estoppcls.
3672. Mental conviction. 3677. Prima facte presumptions.

367 3. Same rules in all courts and cases.‘ 3678. Number of witnesses necessary.
3674. Matters judicially recognized. [

§ 3670. The object of all legal investigation is the discovery
of truth. The rules of evidence are framed with a view to this
prominent end—~seeking always for pure sources and the highest
evidence.

§ 3671. Competent evidence is that tvhich is admissible. Sufficient evidence is that which is satisfactory for the purpose.
Cumulative evidence is that which is additional to other already
obtained. Direct evidence is that which immediately points to
the question at issue. Indirect, or circumstantial evidence is
that which only tends to establish the issue, by proof of various
facts, sustaining by their consistency, the hypothesis claimed.
Presumptive evidence consists of inferences drawn by human
experience from the connection of cause and effect, and observations of human conduct.

§ 3672. Moral and reasonable certainty is all that can be ex-.
pected in legal investigation. In all civil cases the preponder-i
ance of testimony is considered suflicient to produce mental conviction. In criminal cases a greater strength of mental conviction is held necessary to justify a verdict of guilty.

 

§ 3673. Generally, the rules of evidence are the same in all
the courts of this State, and upon every trial the exceptions exist only by express statute.

§ 3674. The existence and territorial extent of States, their
form of government, and symbols of nationality, the laws of nations and general customs of merchants, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of our own Government, as well as the local divisions of our own State, the seals of the several departments
of the Government of the Confederate States, and of the several
States of the Confederacy, and all similar matters of public knowledge are judicially recognized without the introduction of proof.

§ 3675. Presumptions are either of law or of fact. The former arc conclusions and inferences which the law draws from
given facts. The latter are exclusively questions for the jury, to
be decided by the ordinary test of human experience.

§ 3676. Presumptions of law are sometimes conclusive, and an
averment to the contrary will not be allowed. These are termed
estoppels, and are not generally favored. Among these are the
presumptions in favor of a record or judgment unreversed, of the
proper conduct of courts and judicial oiiicers acting within their
legitimate sphere. Of other ochers of the law after lapse of
time has rendered it dangerous to open the investigation of their
acts in regard to mere formalities of the law. Of ancient deeds,
and other instruments more than thirty years old, when they
come from the proper custody, and possession has been held in
accordance with them. Recitals in deeds, except payment of
purchase money as against the grantor acting in his own right,
and sui jure's and his privies in estate, blood and in law. The
landlord’s title, as against his tenant, while tenant in possession.
Solemn admissions made in judicio, and other admissions, upon
which other parties have acted, either to their own injury or the
benefit of the persons making the admissions, and similar cases
where it would be more unjust and productive of more evil to
hear the truth than to bear the investigation.

§ 3677. Other presumptions of law, such as of innocence, and
in some cases of guilt—of continuance of life for seven years, of
a mental state once proved to exist, and all similar presumptions
may be rebutted by proof.

§ 3678. The testimony of a single witness is generally sufficient
to establish a fact. Exceptions to this rule are made in specified

cases: such as to convict of treason of perjury; in any case of}
felony, where the only witness is an accomplice; and to rebut a1
responsive statement in an answer in equity—in these cases (except in treason) corroborating circumstances may dispense with

another witness.

GENERAL RULES,

3679. Must be relevant. ' 3686. Copies of wills and records.
3680. Character and conduct of parties. 3687. Ochers de facto.
3681. Burden of proof. _ 3688. Inscriptions on monuments, &c.

3683. Best evidence. 3690. Secondary evidence.
3684. Primary and secondary evidence. 3691. Degrees therein.
3685. Wntten evidence. 3692. Existence of original.

§ 3679. The evidence must relate to the questions being tried
by the jury, and bear upon them either directly or indirectly.
Irrelevant matter should be excluded.

§ 3680. The general character of the parties, and especially their
conduct in other transactions, are irrelevant matter, unless the
nature of the action involves such character and renders necessary or proper the investigation of such conduct.

§ 3681. The burden of proof generally lies upon the party as.
serting or affirming a fact, and to the existence of whose case or
defence the proof of such fact is essential. If a negation or negative affirmation be so essential, the proof of such negative lies
on the party so aflirming it.

§ 3682. What amount of evidence will change the arms or
burden Of proof, is a question to be decided in each case by the
sound discretion of the court.

§ 3683. The best evidence which exists of the fact sought to be
proved must be produced, unless its absence is satisfactorily accounted for.

§ 3684. Primary evidence is such as in itself does not indicate
the existence of other and better proof. Secondary evidence is
such as from necessity in some cases is substituted for stronger
and better proof.

§ 3685. Written evidence is considered of higher proof than
oral, and in all cases where the parties have reduced their contract, agreement or stipulation to writing, and assented thereto,
it is the best evidence of the same.

§ 3686. Copies of records of judicial proceedings, and wills admitted to probate, are admitted as primary evidence, when properly authenticated. In all other cases, a copy is secondary evidencc.

§ 3687. An oilicer de facto may be proved by his acts, without the production of his commission or appointment.

§ 3688. InscriptiOns on walls, monuments, and other hxed objects, may be proved by copies established as such.

§ 3689. Other cases of necessity, or manifest convenience,
resting on like principles of reason and justice, may be made exceptions to the general rule.

§ 3690. In order to admit secondary evidence, it must appear
that the primary evidence, for some suHicient cause, is not accessible to the diligence of the party. This showing is made to the

court who will hear the party himself, on the question of dili—
gence, and the inaccessibility of the primary evidence.

§ 3691. There are degrees in secondary evidence, and the best

should always be produced. Thus, a duplicate is better than a

copy, and an examined copy than oral evidence.

§ 3692. The existence of a genuine original, is essential to the
admissibility of a c0py. The amount of evidence to show such
existence, must vary with the circumstances of each case.

Where no direct issue is made upon this fact, slight evidence
would be sumcient.

3699. Of deceased persons. 

§ 3693. Hearsay evidence is that which does not derive its,
value solely from the credit of the witness, but rests mainly on
the veracity and competency of other persons. The very nature
of the evidence shows its weakness, and it is admitted only in
specified cases from necessity.

§ 3694. When in a legal investigation, information, conversations, letters, and replies, and similar evidence, are facts to ex:
plain conduct and ascertain motives, they are admitted in evidence not as hearsay, but as original evidence.

§ 3695. Pedigree, including descent, relationship, birth, marriage, and death, may be proved either by the declarations of deceased persons related by blood or marriage, or by general repute
in the family, or by genealogies, inscriptions, “family trees,” and
similar evidence.

gestw.
§ 3697. Declarations of a person in possession of property in
disparagement of his own title, are admissible in evidence, in favor of any one, and against privies. Declarations in favor of his]

of any one of the conspirators during the pendency of the crim-1‘
inal project, are admissible against all.

§ 3699. The declarations and entries of a person, since deceased, against his interest, and not made with a view to pending
litigation, are admissible in evidence in any case.

§ 3700. The books of account of any merchant, shopkeeper,;
physician, blacksmith, or other person doing a regular business

and keeping daily entries thereof, may be admitted in evidence,
as proof of such accounts, upon the following conditions:

1. That he kept no clerk, or else the clerk is dead, or otherwise inaccessible.

2. Upon proof, (the party’s oath being sufhcient,) that the
book tendered is his book of original entries.

books.

4. Upon inspection by the court, to see if the books are free
from any suspicion of fraud.

are admissible to prove matters of public interest, in which the
whole community are supposed to take interest, and to have
knowledge.

transaction to which they relate, are admissible in evidence.

§ 3703. Traditionary evidence, as to ancient boundaries and

§ 3704. Dying declarations made by any person in the article
of death, who is conscious of his condition, as to the cause of his
death, and the person who killed him, are admissible in evidence,

entire testimony, as to the particular matter about which he testilies.

drunkenness induced for the purpose; or admissions or propositions made with a view to a compromise are not proper evidence.

§ 3772. The competency of a witness must be decided by the.
court. Witnesses are incompetent— j

1. VVho'are deficient in understanding.

2. Who are infamous by reason of crime.

3. Who are interested in the event of the suit.

4. Who are related as husband and wife.

5. By reason of their ignoble status—such as slaves and free
persons of color. Religious belief goes only to the credit.

rescue. If he be a party to a case, necessary affidavits to obtain
his civil rights, may he made by him.

§ 3778. Every person is incompetent, unless called by the opposite party, whether a party to the record or not, who has a direct legal interest in the event of the suit, or for or against Whom
the record might be legal evidence in some subsequent suit.

§ 3779. An interest in the question. an honorary obligation, an
imaginary interest, or a remote. contingent or uncertain interest,
will not disqualify, but goes to the credit.

§ 3780. The following also are exceptions to the general rule in

reference to interest :
1 . Persons declared competent by statute, notwithstanding their

interest.
2. Persons entitled to rewards on conviction in criminal prosecutions.

3. Agents or bailees called to prove facts done for their principals in the course of their employment.

4. Witnesses whose interest is balanced on either side.

5. Interest acquired by a witness subsequent to his being subpoenaed either willfully to render himself incompetent, or fraudulently by the other party. '

6. Nominal parties to the record, liable only for cost. .

§ 3781. An interested witness may be rendered competent at
any time before examination, by a release, either made to or by
him. Neither he, nor the party, by refusing to accept the release can continue his incompetency.

§ 3782. Husband and wife, lawfully married, cannot be witnesses

for or against each other, nor can the wife he a witness fora third
person, where her testimony may indirectly affect her husband.
The objection exists after the dissolution of the marriage, by death
or otherwise, as to all knowledge acquired by either party by reason of the marriage relation. An exception to this general rule
exists in all criminal or quasi- criminal proceedings against either
party for offences upon the person of the other.
§ 3783. An exception to the rule excluding interested parties
exists in all cases where, from necessity or convenience, the oath
of the party is received by the court in proof of facts preliminary to other evidence, or in the conduct of a cause. The evidence
of the party is also received in od'ium apolitatoris when after
proof of the tort, the extent of the injury may be proved by him,
and against a bailor guilty of negligence, to show the extent of
the loss, there being no other evidence within the party’s power;
and in certain Inferior Courts where by law this evidence is
admitted.

§ 3784. The objection to competency, if known, must be taken
before the witness is examined at all. It may be proved by the
Witness himself, or by other testimony ; if proved by other testimony, the witness is incompetent to explain it away.

§ 3785. A deposit of money to cover all costs, or any other
act which, in the judgment of the court, relieves the witness

 

from his interest, or other ground of incompetency, will restore
his competency.

§ 3786. The sanction of an oath, or affirmation equivalent
thereto, is necessary to the reception .of any oral evidence. The
court may frame such aiiirmation according to the religious faith
of the witness.

§ 3787. In all cases either party has the right to have the witnesses of the other party examined, out of the hearing of each
other. The court will take proper care to effect this ’object, as
far as practicable and convenient, but any mere irregularity shall
not exclude the witness.

§ 3788. The right of cross examination, thorough and sitting,
belongs to every party as to the witnesses called against him.
If several parties to the same case have distinct interests, each
may exercise this right.

§ 3789. Leading questions are generally allowed in cross ex-‘
amiuations, and only in these ; but the court may exercise a discretion in granting the right to the party calling the witness,
and in refusing it to the opposite party when, from the conduct
of the witness, or other reason, justice requires it.

§ 3790. A witness may refresh and assist his memory by the:
use of any written instrument, or memorandum, provided he:
finally speaks from his recollection, thus refreshed, or is willing]
to swear positively from the paper.

§ 3791. Where the question under examination, and to be de-f
cided by the jury is one of opinion, any witness may swear to
his opinion or belief, giving his reasons therefor; but, if the issue is as to the existence of a fact, the opinions of witnesses,
generally, are inadmissible.

§ 3792. The opinions of experts, on any question of science,
skill, trade, or like questions, are always admissible; and such
opinions may be given on the facts as proved by other witnesses.

by him, except where he can show to the court that he has been
entrapped by the witness, by a previous contradictory statement.

matters hereinbefore specilied in relation to a party making discovery.

1. By disproving the facts testified to by him.

2. By proof of contradictory statements previously made by
him as to matters relevant to his testimony and to the case.

3. By evidence as to his general bad character.

§ 3796. Before contradictory statements of the witness can be
proved against him, (unless they are written statements, made
under oath, in connection with some judicial proceedings.) the
mind of the witness himself, should be called with as much certainty as possible to the time, place, person, and circumstances
attending the former statement; and if in writing, the same
should be shown to the witness,'or read in his hearing, if in existence; and to lay this foundation, the Witness may be recalled
at any time.

§ 3797. To prove general bad character, the impeaching witness should be first asked as to his knowledge of the general
character of the witness; and next as to what that character is,
and lastly, he may be asked, if, from that character, he would
believe him on his oath.

§ 3798. The witness may be sustained by similar proof of
character. But the particular transactions, or the opinions of
single individuals, cannot be inquiredof on either side, except
upon cross examination, in seeking for the extent and foundation
of the witness’ knowledge.

§ 3799. A witness, impeached by proof of contradictory statements, may be sustained by proof of general good character—41w
effect of the evidence to be determined by the jury.

§ 3800. The state of the witness’ feelings to the parties, and
,his relationship, may always be proved for the consideration 'of
the jury.

§ 4088. If discovery issonght of one or more of the defendants
it shall be specially prayed, and interogatories regularly numbered, shall be embodied in the bill, as to every point on which discovery is sought, and the names of the defendants from whom

§ 4101. A defendant may either demur, plead or answer to a
cause in equity, or may file two or all of these defences at once,
without waiving the benefit of either, or may file two or more
pleas to the same action in like manner as at law. In all cases,
demurrer, pleas and answer shall be disposed of in the order
named; and all demurrers and pleas shall be filed and determined at the first term, unless continued by the court or by consent of parties.

§ 4102. A demurrer denies the right to the discovery or relief,
in whole or in part, admitting the allegations of the bill to be
true, and is founded either upon a want of jurisdiction in the
court, or of equitable right in the complainant, or upon a non:
joinder or mis—joinder of parties, or causes of action, or the absence of liability by the defendant to the complainant.

§ 4103. A pure plea sets up some additional fact or facts,
which, taken with the facts stated in the bill, show that the complainant is not entitled to relief. An impure or anomalous -plea
is filed when the complainant, anticipating the defendant’s plea,
alleges facts to impeach or annul its effect. In such case the
plea must negative the impeaching allegations, and must be accompanied by an answer discovering all the facts within defen7
dant’s power as to such allegations. A pure plea need not be
verified. The answer accompanying an anomalous plea must be
under oath or afiirmation.

4166. Failing to certify.

§ 4159. No cause shall be carried to the Supreme Court upon
any bill of exceptions, so long as the same is pending in the
court below, unless the decision or judgment complained of, if '
it had been rendered as claimed by the plaintiff in error, would
have been a final disposition of the cause. But at any stage of‘
the cause, either party may file his exceptions to any decision,
sentence or decree of the Superior Court; and if the same is
certified and. allowed, it shall .be entered of record in the cam;
and should the case at its dual termination be carried by writ of

error to the Supreme Court by either party, error may be as—
signed upon such bills of exception, and a reversal and new trial
may be allowed thereon when it is manifest that such erroneous
decision of the court has or may have affected the final result of
the case. 

§ 4160. Either party in any civil cause, and the defendant in}
any criminal proceeding in the Superior Courts of this State,
may except to any sentence, judgment, decision or decree of such
court, or of the Judge thereof, in any matter heard at chambers. Such bill of exceptions shall specify plainly the
complained of, and the alleged error, and shall be signed by the

party, or his attorney or solicitor.
§ 4161. Such bill of exceptions shall be tendered to the Judge:
- who presided in the cause within thirty days from the adjourn-1
ment of the court, or the date of the decision at chambers,
and if the same is true and contains, in connection with the
the transcript of the record, all the facts necessary to the understanding and adjudication of the alleged error, the said Judge
shall sign and certify the same, substantially as follows: “ I dOw
certify that the foregoing bill of exceptions is true, and containsI
all the evidence material to a clear understanding of the errors
complained of, and the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county
of is hereby required and ordered to make out aeomplete
copy of the record of said case, and certify the same as such, and
cause the same to be transmitted to the term of the
district of the Supreme Court, that the errors alleged to have
been committed may be considered and corrected.” This certificate shall be the writ of error.

§ 4162. Exceptions tendered before the dual hearing or jndg-l
ment for the mere purpose of being made a part of the recordd
shall be certified to be true by the Judge, and ordered to be
placed on the record. Such exceptions mint be tendered during
the term.

§ 4163. If the Judge trying the cause resigns, or otherwise;
ceases to hold his oiicc as Judge, when the bill of exceptions is'
tendered, he may nevertheless sign and certify as above. And if ,
he should die before certifying the same, or otherwise becomes incapable of acting, then the party may verify his bill of exceptibns
by his own oath, or that of his attorney, together with the oath of
at least one disinterested member of the bar who was present at
the trial. And such verifications shall operate in the same man-‘1

 

ner as the certificate of the Judge. If the Judge is absent from
home, or by other casualty fails to certify the bill of exceptions
within the time specified (and without fault of the party tendering)
he may still sign and certify as soon as possible, which shall be
held and deemed valid. ’

§ 4164. If either party dies between the hearing and the tendaring of the bill of exceptions, the Judge shall nevertheless sign
and certify the same, and parties shall be made in the Supreme
Court: as in other cases; the notices required in such cases to be
given and received, may be given and received by the attorneys
of the respective parties though such parties be dead.

§ 4165. If the Judge shall determine that the bill of exceptions
is not true, or does not contain all the necessary facts, he shall return the same’ within ten days to the party, or his attorney, with
his objections to the same in writing. If these objections are
met and removed, the Judge may then certify, specifying in his
certificate the cause of the delay. If the Judge sees pr0per, he
may order noticevto the opposite party of the fact and time of
tendering the exceptions, and may hear evidence as to the truth
thereof. '

§ 4166. If from any cause the bill of exceptions is not certified
by the Judge without fault of the party tendering, such party or
his attorney shall apply at the next term of the Supreme Court,
wherever it may be, and on petition obtain from said court a
mandamus m’ 823 directed to such Judge. Such petition must
set out substantially the bill of exceptions tendered, and shall
be verified by- the attorney as to the truth of the bill as tendered, and by the party or his attorney as to the other facts stated thererein. , The mdamus m: .973 shall be served by some
Sheriif of this State, and his return made to the Clerk of the Snpreme Court. It shall be returnable at some term of the Snpreme Court, at which term the court shall consider and deter'mine the validity of the reasons given by the Judge for his failure or refusal, but in no case shall a traverse as to the truth of
such return of the Judge be allowed. If the reasons be insuflicient, or the Judge fails or refuses to make any return to the man- '
dam/us mi .973, the Supreme Court shall issue a mandamus absolute
commanding the Judge to sign and certify the bill of exceptions.
If he still refuses so to do, the cause shall be heard by the Su- «
preme Court on the exceptions as verified in the petition for r
mandamus.

§ 4167. Within ten days after the bill of exceptions is signed
and certified, the party plaintiff therein, shall serve a copy thereof upon the oposite party or his attorney, and if there be several

there is no opposite party, notice to no one is necessary. In ca.ses of interpleader or otherwise, where the real contestant is not
the opposite party on the record, notice shall be given to such
real contestant, in addition to the copy served as above.

§ 4169. In a criminal case, the cepy bill of exceptions shall be
served upon the Attorney or Solicitor General, as the case may‘
be, or upon a Solicitor General pro tem. who tried the cause, if he
is still acting under the appointment.

the Judge, the bill of exceptions shall be filed in the otlice of the
Clerk of the court where the case was tried ;' and in ten days from
the date of such filing, it shall be the duty of the Clerk to make
out a copy of such bill, together with a complete transcript of the
record in such cause. Such transcript, together with the originan
bill of exceptions, the Clerk shall transmit, together with a cer—
tificate that the same is the true, original bill of exceptions, and a
true and complete transcript of the record in such case, to the
next term of the Supreme Court, as required in the J udge’s certiiicate, directing the same to the Clerk of the said court. The
copy bill of' exceptions shall be retained inthe oiiice of the Clerk
of the Superior Court.

§ 4171. The bill of exceptions thus filed shall operate as a 815-:
pcrserlms upon the plaintiff in error complying with the follow:
ing terms: In a civil cause, the party shall, on or before filing the
bill of exceptions, pay all costs, and by himself, his agent or at-I
torney in fact or at law, give bond with good security, payablel
to the opposite party, and conditioned for the payment of the
eventual condemnation money, and all subsequent costs, which
bond shall be attested and approved by the said Clerk. Or he1
may iile an affidavit with the said Clerk, stating that he is unable from his poverty to pay the costs and give the security for
the eventual condemnation money, and that his counsel has ad. vised him that. he has good cause for a writ of error, which affidavit shall operate as if the costs were paid and bond given. In
a criminal cause, where the offence is bailable, the defendant shall
enter into a recognizance before the said Clerk, with security to
be approved by him, in a sum to be fixed by the presiding J edge,
conditioned for the personal appearance of such defendant, to
abide the final order, judgment or sentence of said court. If the
offence is not bailable, the Judge shall order a superde at an
time of filing the bill of exceptions. If the party is unable from
his poverty to give the recognizance, the Judge shall order a eupersedeae upon the filing of an aflidavit as provided in civil cases,

discharge any duty required of him in connection with the fore.
going provisions, upon petition the Supreme Court, or the J edge
of the Superior Court may compel the performance of such duty
by mcmdamue ,- and no suitor shall lose any right by reason of
the failure of such ofiicers to discharge their duties, where hehas
been guilty of no fault himself, and has exercised ordinary diligence to secure their discharge of duty.

tfiled at any time before the court has completed the docket for

judgment of the court below shall stand ailirmed (unless the
