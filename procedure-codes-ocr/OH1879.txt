PLEADING IN GE!':F.RAL.
SUBDIVISION I. 
SEC. 5057. The forms of pleading in civil actions in courts of
record, and the rules by which their sufficiency shall be determined,
are those prescribed in this chapter. (51 v. 57, ~ 83.] 
SEC. 5058. The pleadings are the written statements by the par­
ties, of the facts constituting their respective claims and defenses;
all fictions therein are abolished; and the title of a cause shall not be 
changed in any of. its stages, exceft when the defendant prosecutes
error. f51 v. 57, ~§ 82, 115, 116. 
SEC. 5059. The only pleadings allowed are-
1. Petition.
2. Demurrer. 
3. Answer; which, when affirmative relief is demanded therein,
may be styled cross-petition. 
4. Reply. 

SEc. 5060. The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff shall be
the petition, which must contain- 
1. The name of the court and the county in which the action is
brought, and the names of the parties, followed by the word "Peti­
tion." 
2. A statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language. 
3. A demand of the relief to which the party supposes himself enti­
tled; if the recovery of money is demanded, the amount shall be stated;
and if interest is claimed, the time for which interest is to be computed 
shall be also stated. 
SEc. 5061. When the petition contains more than one cause of
ac,tion, they shall be separately stated and numbered.
SEC. 5062. The defendant may demur to the petition only when
it appears on its face either- 
1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the· def end-
an t, or the subject of the action. 
2. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue. 
3. That there is another action pending between the same parties,
for the same cause. 
4. That there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff.
5. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant.
6. That several causes of action are improperly joined.
7. That separate causes of action against several defendants are 
improperly joined.
8. That the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a 
cause of action. ls I v. 57, § 87.] 
SEC. 5063. The demurrer shall specify the grounds of objection
to the petition; and unless it does so, it shall be regarded as objecting
only that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action, or that the court has not jurisdiction of the subject matter. 

SEC. 5064. When any of the defects enumerated in section jfr,e
thousand and sixty-ttoo do not appear upon the face of the petition, the
objection may he taken by answer; and if no objection be taken either
by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall he deemed to have waived
the same, except only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court,
and that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause 
of action. 
SEC. 5065. When a demurrer is sustained on the ground of mis-

JOin er O Severa causes O action m a pet1t1011 or answer, t e court,
on motion of the party who filed the pleading, shall allow him, with or 
without costs, in its discretion, to file several petitions, each including
such of the causes of action as might have been joine<l; and an action
shall be docketed for each of the petitions, and the same shall be pro-
ceeded in without further service. 
SEC. 5066. The defendant may demur to one or more of the sev-
eral causes of action stated in the petition, and answer as to the residue. 

SEC. 5067. The defendant may also demur to the reply, or to a
separate traverse or avoidance contained in the reply, of a defense or 
counterclaim, on the ground that it is insufficient in law, upon its face. 
SEC. 5068. The plaintiff may demur to a counterclaim, set-off,

or erense consistmg o new matter contame m t re answer, on t e 
ground that it is insufficient in law, on its face. 
SEC. 5069. The plaintiff may also demur to a counterclaim or
set-off, upon which the defendant demands an affirmative judgment, 
when it appears on its face either-
1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the subject thereof.
2. That the defendant has not legal capacity to recover upon the 
same. 
3. That there is another action pending between the same parties,
for the same cause. 
4. That the counterclaim is not of the character specified in section 
fi1e thousand and serrnty-tu-o.

entitle the defendant to the relief demanded. 

SEc. 5070. The answer shall contain-
1. A general or specific denial of each material allegation of the 
petition controverted hy the defendant.
2. A statement of any new matter constituting a defense, counter­ 
claim, or set-off, in ordinary and concise language. 
SEC. 5071. The defendant mav set forth in his answer as manv
grounds of defense, counterclaim, and set-off as he has, whether the)· 
are such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or
both; he may claim therein relief touching the matters in question in
the petition against the plaintiff, or against other defendants in the same 
action; and each must be separately stated and numbered, and they
must refer in an intelligible manner to the causes of action which they 
are intended to answer. 
SEC. 6072. The counterclaim mentioned m the preceding section
must be one existing in favor of a defendant, and against a plaintiff,
between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and
arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the petition as the
foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject of the 
action.
SEC. 5073. If a defendant omit to set up a counterclaim or set-off,
he can not recover costs against the plaintiff in any subsequent action
thereon; but this section shall not apply to causes of action which are
stricken out of or withdrawn from the answer, as provided in sections 
fi·zre thousand and seuenty-four and five thousand and eighty-miu.
SEC. 5074. When it appears that a new party is necessary to a
final decision upon the counterclaim, the court may either permit the
new party to be made by a summons to answer the counterclaim, or
may direct the counterclaim to be stricken out of the answer, and made 
the subject of a separate action. 
SEC. 5075. A set-off can only be pleaded in an action founded on 
contract, and must be a cause of action arising upon contract, or ascer­
tained by the decision of a court. 
SEC. 5076. If a new party be necessary to a final decision upon
the set off, the court shall permit the new party to be made, if, owing
to the insolvency or non-residence of the plaintiff, or other cause, the
defendant will be in danger of losing his claim unless permitted to 
use it as a set-off.
SEc. 5077. When cross-demands have existed between persons, 
under such circumstances that if one had brought an action against the
other a counterclaim or set-off could have been set up, neither can he
deprived of the benefit thereof by assignment by the other, or by his
death, but the two demands must be deemed compensated, so far as 
they equal each other. 
SEC. 5078. The guardian of an infant, or of a person of unsound
mind, or an attorney for a person in prison, shall deny in the answer 
all material alle&ations of the petition prejudicial to such defendant. 

SUBDIVISION V. REPLY. 
SEC. 5079. When the answer contains new matter, the plaintiff
may reply to such new matter, denying generally or specifically each
allegation controverted by him; and he may also allege, in ordinary
and concise language, any new matter, not inconsistent with the peti­
tion, constituting an answer to such new matter in the answer. 
SEC. 5080. When in an answer affirmative relief is demanded
against a co-defendant, such co-defendant may demur or answer there­
to, as if it were a petition ; and to such answer of the co-defendant a
demurrer or reply may be filed as in other cases. 
SEC. 5081. Every material allegation of the petition not contro­
verted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter in
the answer not controverted by the reply, shall, for the purposes of the
action, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter in the reply
shall be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require; and allegations of value,
or of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true, by failure to 
controvert them. 
SEC. 5082. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to
the claim or defense, which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient. 
SEC. 5083. Neither presumptions of law, nor matters of which
is taken, need be stated in the pleading. 
SEc. 5084. If an original pleading be lost, or withheld by any
person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be substituted. 

SEc. 5085. When the action, counterclaim. or set-off is founded on
an account, or on a written instrument as evidence of indebtedness, a
copy thereof must be attached to and filed with the pleading; and if not
so attached and filed, the reason for the omission must be stated in the 
pleading. 
SEC. 5036. In an action, counterclaim, or set-off, founded upon an
account, or upon an instrument for the unconditional payment of money
only, it shall be sufficient for a party to set forth a copy of the account
or instrument, with all credits and the indorsements thereon, and to
state that there is due to him, on such account or instrument, from the
adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims, with interest; and
when others than the makers of a promissory note, or the acceptors of
a bill of exchange, are parties, it shall lie necessary to slate the f;wts 
which fix their liability, 
SEc. 5087. If redundant, irrelevant, or srurrilous matter he 
inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken out on the motion of the
party prejudiced thereby; and obscene words may lie stricken from a
pleading on the motion of a party, or by the court of its own motion. 

SEc. 5088. When the allegations of a pleading arc so indefinite
and uncertain that the precise nature of the charge or defense is nut 
apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and
certain by amendment. 
SEc. 5089. The court, at any time before the final submission of
the cause, may, on motion of the defendant, allow a counterclaim or
set-off to be withdrawn, and the same may become the subject of another
action; on motion of either party, to be made at the time such counter­
claim or set-off is withdrawn, an action on the same shall be docketed
and proceeded in without process, and the court shall direct the time
and manner of pleading therein; and if an action be not so docketed,
suit may be brought as in other cases. 
SEC. 5090. In pleading a judgment, or other determination of a
court, or of an officer of special jurisdiction, it shall be sufficient to state
that such judgment or determination was duly given or made; and if
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish, on
the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction. 
SEc. 5091. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent
in a contract, it shall be sufficient to state that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts showing such 
performance.
SF.c. 5092. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived there­ 
from, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title, and the
day of its passage. 
SEc. 5093. In an action for a libel or slander, it shall be sufficient
to state, generally, that the defamatory matter was published or spoken
of the plaintiff; if the allegation be denied, the plaintiff must prove the
facts, showing that the defamatory matter was published or spoken of
him; and in such action it shall not be necessary to set out any obscene 
word, but it shall be sufficient to state its substance. 
SEc. 5094. In the actions mentioned in the preceding section, the 
defendant may allege and prove the truth of the matter charged as
defamatory; and in every case he may prove any mitagating circum­ 
stances to reduce the amount of damages. 
SEC. 5096. In an action for the recovery of real estate, the prop­ 
erty shall be described with such certainty as will enable an officer
holding an execution to identify it. 
SEC. 6096. The allegations of a pleading shall be liberally con­

SEC. 5097. The answer or demurrer by the defendant shall be
filed on or before the third Saturday, and the reply or demurrer by the
plaintiff on or before the fifth Saturday, after the return day of the sum­
mons, or service by publication; and the answer or demurrer of a defend­
ant to a cross-petition shall be filed on or before the third Saturday,
and the reply or demurrer thereto on or before the fifth Saturday, after
the cross-petition is filed. 
SEC. 5098. The court, or a judge thereof in vacation, may, for
good cause shown, extend the time for filing any pleading, upon such 
terms as arc just. 
SEC. 5099. A party may annex to his pleading, other than a
demurrer, interrogatories pertinent to the issue made in the pleadings, 
which interrogatories, if not demurred to, shall be plainly and fully
answered under oath, by the party to whom they are propounded, or
if such party is a corporation, by the president, secretary, or other
officer thereof, as the party propounding requires. 
SEC. 5100. When annexed to the petition, the interrogatories sha11
be answered within the time limited for answer to the petition; when 

annexe to t e answer, t ey s a e ans were wit nn t e time mute
for a reply; when annexed to the reply, they shall he answered within
the time allowed tor an answer; but further time may be allowed in all
cases by the court, or a judge thereof in vacation. · 
SEC. 5101. Answers to interrogatories may be enforced by non-suit,
judgment by default, or by attachment, as the justice of the case may 
require ; an , on t e tna , sue answers, so rar as t ey con tam compe- 
tent testimony on the issue or issues made, may be used by either party.

SEC. 5102. Every pleading and motion must be subscribed by the
party or his ~ttorney, and ev~ry pleading of fac.t, except as pro~ided in
the next section, must be venfied by the affidavit of the party, his agent
or attorney; when a corporation is the party, the verification may be
made by an officer thereof, its agent or attorney; and when the state,
or any officer thereof in its behalf, is the party, the verification may be
made by any person acquainted with the facts, the attorney prosecuting
or defending the action, the prosecuting attorney, or the attorney-gen- 
eral. 

SEc. 5103. The verification mentioned in the preceding section
shall not be required to the answer of a guardian, defending for an 
infant, or a person of unsound mind, or the attorney of a person impris-
oned; nor in any case where the admission of the truth of a fact stated
in the pleading might subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecu- 
. 

SEC. 5104. If several parties are united in interest, and plead
together, the affidavit may be made by one of them. 

SEC. 5105. The affidavit shall be sufficient if it is stated therein
that the affiant believes the facts stated in the pleading to be true. 

SEC. 5106. When the party pleading is a non-resident of the county
in which the action is brought, or is absent from the county wherein
the pleading is filed, an affidavit made before filing the pleading, and 
filed with it, stating the substance of the facts afterwards inserted in the
pleading, shall be a sufficient verification. 
SEC. 5107. The affidavit verifying a pleading may be made before
any person before whom a deposition might be taken, and must be signed 
by the party who makes it; the officer before whom the same was taken
shall certify that it was sworn to before him, and signed in his presence;
and the certificate of the officer, signed officially by him, shall be evi-
dence that the affidavit was duly made, that the name of the officer
was written by himself, and that he was such officer. 

SEC. 5108. The verification of the pleading does not apply to the
amount claimed, except in actions founded on contract, express or 
implied, for the payment of money only. 
SEC. 5109. The affidavit verifying a pleading can be made by the
agent or attorney only- 
1. When the facts are within the personal knowledge of the agent
or attorney. 
2. When the plaintiff is an infant, or of unsound mind, or impris­
oned. 
3. When the pleading to be verified is founded upon a written
instrument for the payment of money, and such instrument is in the
possession of the agent or attorney. 
4. When the party is not a resident of, or is absent from, the county. 

SEC. 5110. A pleading, verified as herein required, shall not be 
used against a party in any criminal prosecution, or action or proceed­
ings for a penalty or forfeiture, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged
in such pleading; and such verification shall not make other or greater 
proof necessary on the side of the ad verse party. 
SUBDIVISION VII. MISTAKES AND AMENDMENTS. 
SEC. 5111. The plaintiff may amend his petition without leave, at
any time before the answer is filed, without prejudice to the proceed­
ing; but notice of such amendment shall be served upon the defend­
ant, or his attornel: and the defendant shall have the same time to 
answer or demur thereto as to the original petition. Js1 v. 57, § 134.] 
SEC. 5112. At any time within ten days after a emurrer is filed,
the adverse party may amend, without leave, on payment of costs since
filing the defective pleading; and notice of filing an amended pleading
shall be forthwith served upon the other party, who shall have the same
time thereafter to answer, or reply thereto, as to an original pleading. 

SEC. 5113. When a demurrer is overruled, the party who demurred
may answer or reply, if the court is satisfied that he has a meritorious 
claim or defense, and did not demur for delay. 
SEC. 5114. The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance
of justice, and on such terms as may he proper, amend any pleading,
process, or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party, 
or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case,
or, when the amendment does not change substantially the claim or
defense, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved;
and when an action or proceeding tails to conform to the provisions of
this title, the court may permit the same to be made conformable thereto, 
by amendment. 
SEC. 5115. The court, in every stage of an action, must disregard
any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not affect 
- 
the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be
reversed, or affected, by reason of such error or defect. 

SEC. 5116. If the demurrer be sustained, the adverse party may
amend, if the defect can be remedied by amendment, with or without
costs, as the court in its discretion shall direct. 
SEc. 5117. When either party amends a pleading or proceeding,
and the court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the adverse
party could not be ready for trial in consequence of the amendment, a
continuance may be granted to some day in term, or to another term of
the court. 
SEC. 5118. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defend­
ant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding
by any name and description, and, when the true name is discovered,
the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly; and the plain­
tiff, in such case, must state, in the verification of his petition, that he
could not discover the true name, and the summons must contain the
words '' real name unknown," and a copy thereof must be served per­
sonally upon the defendant. 
SEC. 5119. Either party may be allowed. on such terms as to costs
as the court, or a judge thereof, may prescribe, to file a supplemental 
petition, answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case which occur
subsequent to the filing of the former petition, answer, or reply; but rea­
sonable notice of the application must be given, when the court or judge 
SO requires. 
SEC. 5120. When two or more actions are pending in the same 
court, the defendant may, on motion, and notice to the adverse party,
. require him to show cause why the same shall not be consolidated; and 
if it appear that, at the time the motion is made, the actions could have
been joined, and if the court, or a judge thereof, find that they ought
to be joined, the several actions shall be consolidated. 
SUBDIVISION vm. MOTIONS. 
SEC. 5121. A motion is an application for an order, addressed to a
court or judge, by a party to a suit or proceeding, or one interested

SUBDIVISION I. THE ISSUE-HOW TRIED. 
SEC. 6127. A trial is a judicial examination of the issues, whether
of law or of fact, in an action or proceeding. 
SEC. 5128. Issues arise on the pleadings where a fact, or conclu-
sion of law, is maintained by one party and controverted by the other.
They are of two kinds- 
1. Of law. 
2. Of fact. 
SEC. 5129. An issue of fact arises- 
1. Upon a material allegation in the petition denied by the answer. 
2. Upon a set-off, counterclaim, or' new matter, presented in the
answer and denied by the reply. 
3. Upon material new matter in the reply, which shall be consid­
ered as controverted by the opposite party without further pleading. 

SEC. 5130. Issues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred
as hereinafter provided; and issues of fact arising in actions for the 
recovery of money only, or specific real or personal property, shall be
tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived, or a reference be ordered 
as hereinafter provided. {51 v. 57, § 263.l 
SEC. 5131. All other issues of fact shal] be tried by the court, sub-
ject to its power to order any issue to be tried by a jury, or referred. 

SUBDIVISION 11. TIME OF TR!IAL. 
r 
SEC. 5132. The clerk shall make a trial docket at least twelve days
before the first day of each term, and the cases shall be set for particu- 
lar days, in the order in which they stand on the appearance docket;
a case in all its stages in the same court, and upon every docket or
book, and all papers filed or issued therein, shall bear the appearance
docket number; but the clerk shall not place upon the trial docket any
case in which nothing remains to be done except to execute an order
for the sale of real or personal property, and to distribute the proceeds
as directed by the order; and if it become necessary, the case may be 
redocketed, on the application of either party, whereupon it shall stand
in all respects as if it had remained on the docket. 
SEC. 5133. In an action upon an account, or written instrument
for the payment of money only, or in foreclosure, judgment may be
entered, at any time during the term, after the defendant is in default
for an answer; but the court may, for good cause shown, give further 
time for answer. 
SEC. 5134. Cases in which there is an issue of fact, or in which
damages are to be assessed, shall be tried in the order in which they
stand on the trial docket, unless, by the consent of the parties, or by
the order of the court, they be continued, or placed at the heel of the
docket; all other cases shall be heard in the order in which they stand
on the trial docket, unless the court otherwise direct; and the court
may, at any time, hear a demurrer or a motion, and may, by rule, pre­ 
scribe the time of hearing demurrers and motions. 
SEC. 5135. Actions are triable at the first term of the court after the 
issues therein, by the times fixed for pleading, are or should have been
made up; when the issues are or should have been made up during a
term, such action shall be triable at that term; and when the issues are or
should have been made up either before or <luring a term of court, but after
the period for the preparation of the trial docket of the term, the clerk,
if required bv the court, shall place such actions on the trial docket of 
that term. 
SEc. 5136. The clerk shall make a copy of the trial docket for the
use of the bar before the first day of the term. 
SUBDIVISION III. TENDER, AND OFFER TO CONFFA5S JUDGMENT. 
SEc. 5137. If, in an action on a contract for the payment of money,
the defendant answer and prove that he did tender payment of the
money due on the contract, at any time before the commencement of
the action thereon, and pay to the clerk, at any time before trial, the
money so tendered, the plaintiff shall not have judgment for more than
the money so due and tendered, without costs, and shall pay the defend­ 
ant his costs. 
SEC. 5138. If, in an action on a contract for the payment of any article or thing other than money, or for the performance of any work 
or labor, the defendant answer that he did tender payment or perform-
ance of such contract, at such time and place, and in such articles,
work, or labor, as by such contract he was bound to pay or perform,
and the court or jury find that he Bid tender, as alleged in his pleading,
they shall, at the same time, assess the value of the property or labor so
tendered, and thereupon judgment shall be rendered in favor of the
plaintiff for the sum so found, without interest or costs; but if the defend-
ant forthwith perform his contract, or give to the plaintiff such assurance 
as the court may approve that he will perform the same within such
time as the court may direct, judgment shall be rendered for the defend-
ant; and in case any article so tendered is of a perishable nature, it shall,
from the time of such tender, be kept at the risk and expense of the
plaintiff, provided the defendant take reasonable care of the same. 

SEC. 5139. Before an action for the recovery of money is brought
against any person, he may go into the court of the county of his resi- 
dence, or of that in which the person having the cause of action
resides, which would have jurisdiction of the action, and offer to con- 
fess judgment in favor of such person for a specified sum, on such
cause of action; whereupon, if such person, having had such notice
that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of the time and place
of making it, as the court deems reasonable, fail to attend to accept
the confession, or if he attend, and refuse to accept it, and afterwards
commence an action upon such cause, and fail to recover more than
the amount so offered to be confessed, and the interest thereon from
the date of the offer, he shall pay all the costs of the action. 

SEC. 5140. The defendant in an action for the recovery of money
only may, at any time before the trial, serve upon the plaintiff, or his 
attorney, an offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against him,
for the sum specified therein; if the plaintiff accept the offer, and give
notice thereof to the defendant, or his attorney, within five days after
service of it, the offer, and an affidavit that the notice of acceptance
was delivered in the time limited, may be filed by the plaintiff, or the
defendant may file the acceptance, with a copy of the offer, verified by
affidavit; in either case the offer and acceptance shall be noted in the
journal, and judgment rendered accordingly ; if the notice of accept-
ance be not given in the period limited, the offer shall be deemed with-
drawn; and if the plaintiff fail to obtain judgment for more than was
offered by the defendant, he shall pay the defendant's costs from the 
time of the offer. 
SEC. 5141. The defendant in an action for the recovery of money
 may offer in court to confess judgment for part of the amount claimed, 
or part of the causes involved in the action; whereupon, if the plain­
tiff, being present, refuse to accept such confession of judgment, in full
of his demands against the defendant in the action, or, having had
such notice that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of the
time of making it, as the court deems reasonable. fail to attend, and,
on the trial, do not recover more than was so offered to be confessed,
and the interest thereon from the date of the offer, such plaintiff shall
pay all the costs of the defendant incurred after the offer was made. 

SEC. 5142. n offer ma.de as provided in the three preceding sec-
tions shall not be deemed an admission of the cause of action, nor
of the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled: nor shall it be a cause
of continuance of the action, or a postponement of the trial, or given 
in evidence Or mentioned On the trial. 

SEc. 3. The prov1s1ons of this subdivision shall be applied, so
far as they may fairly be made applicable, to a tender or offer made by
the plaintiff; and to the same extent, the same provisions may, in the
discretion of the court, be applied to one or more of several causes of
action, counterclaim, or set-off, in which case the court shall make such
order as to costs as it deems proper. 
SUBDIVISIOS IV. REVIVOR OF ACTIONS. 
SEC. 5144. Except as otherwise provided, no action or proceeding
pending in any court shall abate by the death of either or both of the
parties thereto, except an action for libel, slander, malicious prosecu­
tion, assault, or assault and battery, for a nuisance, or against a justice
of the peace for misconduct in office, which shall abate by the death of 
either party. 
SEC. 5145. If the plaintiff in an action for dower die before final
Judgment therein, the action may be revived in the name of her per­
sonal representative, fr r the purpose mentioned in section Ji/lJ·-seven 
hundred and ft/tan. 
SEC. 5146. When there are several plaintiffs or defendants, and one
of them dies, or his powers as a personal representative cease, if the
right of action survive to or against the remaining parties, the action
may proceed; but the death of the party, or the cessation of his pQw­
ers, shall be first stated on the record. 
SEc. 5147. When one of several plaintiffs or defendants dies. or
his powers as a personal representative cease, if the cause of action 

does not survive, the court, if of opinion that the merits of the contro-
versy can be properly determined, and the principles applicable to the 
case fully settled, may proceed to try the same as between the remain-

mg parties; ut t e JU gment s a not preju ice any person w o was
not a party at the time of the trial. 
SEC. 5148. When one of the parties to an action dies, or his
owers as a personal representative cease before judgment, if the right
of action survives in favor of or against his representatives or succes-
sor, the action may be revived, and proceed in the name of such repre-
sentatives or successor. (38 v. 146, ~~ 240, 241; 51 v. 57, § 402.] 
SEC. 5149. A reviver may be effected by the allowance by the
c_ourt, or a judge. t~ereof in vacation, of a motion of t~e representa- 
tive or successor m interest to become a party to the action, or by sup-
plemental pleading alleging the death of the party, and naming his
representative or successor in interest upon whom service may be made 
as in the commencement of an action ; but the limitations contained
in subsequent sections of this chapter do not apply to this section. 

SEC. 5150. A revivor may also be effected by a conditional order
of the court, if made in term, or by a judge thereof, if in vacation, 
that the action be revived in the name of the representative or successor
of the party who died, or whose powers ceased, and proceed in favor 
of or against him. (51 v. 57, § 403.] 
SEC. 5151. The order may be made on the motion of the adverse
party, or of the representative or successor of the party who died, or 
whose powers ceased, suggesting his death, or the cessation of his
powers, which, with the name and capacities of his representative or
successor, shall be stated in the order. 
SEC. 5152. If the order be made by consent of the parties, the ac-
tion shall forthwith stand revived; if not made by consent, the order 
shall be served upon the party adverse to the party on whose motion it
was made, in the same manner, and returned within the same time, as
a summons; and if sufficient cause be not shown against the revivor, 
the action shall stand revived.. (51 v. 57, § 405.] . 
SEC. 5153. When the plaintiff makes an affidavit that the repre-
sentatives of the defendant, or any of them in whose name the action 

is ordered to e revive , are non-res, ents o t e state, or have left the 
state to avoid the service of the order, or so conceal themselves that
the order cannot be served upon them, or that the names and residence
of the heirs or devisees of the person against whom the action is ordered
to be revived, or some of them, are unknown to the affiant, a notice
may be published for six consecutive weeks, as provided by sectionjfr«
thousand and forty-eight, notifying them to appear on a day therein
named, not less than ten days after the publication is complete, and
show cause why the action should not be revived against them; and if
sufficient cause be not shown to the contrary, the action shall stand re- 

SEC. 5154. Upon the death of the plaintiff the action may be re- 
vived in the names of his representatives to whom his right has passed;
if his right has passed to his personal representative, the reviver shall
be in his name; and if it has passed to his heirs or devisees who could
support the action if brought anew, the revivor may be in their names. 

SEC. 5155. Upon the death of a defendant, in an action wherein
the right, or any part thereof, survives against his personal representa­ 
tive, the revivor shall be against him ; and it may also be against the
heirs or devisees of the defendant, or both, when the right of action, 
or any part thereof, survives against them. 
SEC. 5156. Upon the death of a defendant in an action for the
recovery of real property only, or which concerns only his rights or
claims to such property, the action may be revived against his heirs or
devisees, or both, and an order therefor may be forthwith made, in the
manner directed in the preceding sections of this subdivision. 

SEC. 5157. An order to revive an action against the representa­
tive or successor of a defendant shall not be made without the consent
of such representative or successor, unless within one year from the 
time it could have been first made. 
SEc. 5158. An order to revive an action in the name of the repre­
sentative or successor of a plaintiff may be made forthwith, but shall
not be made, of right, without the consent of the defendant, after the
expiration of one year from the time the order might have been first
made; but when the defendant is dead, or his powers have ceased, the
order of revivor on both sides may be made in the period limited 
in the last section. 
SEC. 5159. When it appears by affidavit that the powers of a party
who sues or is sued as a personal representative have ceased, or that
either party to an action has been dead, for a period so long that the
action can not be revived in the names of his representatives or suc­
cessor without the consent of both parties, the court shall order the 
action to be stricken from the docket. 
SEC. 5160. At any term succeeding the death of the plaintiff,
while the action remains on the docket, the defendant, having given to
the plaintiff's representatives in whose names the action might be
revived ten days' notice of the application, may have an order to strike 
the action from the docket, and for costs against the estate of the plain­ 
tiff, unless the action be forthwith revived. 
SEc. 5161. When an action stands revived, the trial thereof shall
not be postponed by reason of the reviver.

SUBDIVISION I. SVl\ll\lONING AND IMPANELING THE JURY. 
SEC. 5162. The court of common pleas of each county shall, at
the first term thereof in each year, determine the number of persons 
necessary to be selected in each county, annually, to serve as grand
and petit jurors in the district court, superior court, and court of com­
mon pleas, and in counties in which the probate court has criminal
jurisdiction, for such probate court required in such jurisdiction, and
cause a memorandum thereof to be entered on the journal; such
order, if not made at that term, may be made at any other time, and
amended from time to time at the discretion of the court, and, until it
is made, the number of persons to be selected for jurors in each county
shall be as theretofore determined; but if there has been no such
determination, the number shall be one hundred and thirty, until other­ 
wise ordered.
SEc. 5163. The clerk of the court of common pleas of each
county shall, on the first Monday of September, annually, apportion 
the number of jurors determined as aforesaid among the several town­
ships, and the wards of municipal corporations, in his county, accord­
ing to the number of male inhabitants therein of twenty-one years of
age, and shall make, in writing, a statement of the number of jurors so
apportioned to each township and ward, and. forthwith deliver the
same to the sheriff, who, at the time of giving public notice of the gen­
eral fall election, shall insert a clause in his notification giving the
trustees of the several townships, and the councilmen of the several
wards, notice of the number of persons to be returned for jurors there­ 
from, respectively. 
SEC. 5164. The trustees of each township, and the councilmen of
each ward, shall, on the day of such general election, annually, select,
of good, judicious persons, having the qualifications of an elector, and
not exempt by law from serving as jurors, the number of persons desig­
nated in the notice to be returned for jurors therefrom, and shall make
a list thereof, and deliver the same to the judge of election who returns
to the clerk of the court the poll-book of the election; and such judge of
election shall deliver the list to the clerk at the time he returns the poll­ 
book. 
SEC. 5165. If the trustees of any township, or the councilmen of
any ward, fail to return the names of jurors as herein required, to the 
clerk of the court, the clerk shall, on ascertaining the fact, immediately
notify the trustees or councilmen of the failure, and they shall there­
upon meet, and select and return to the clerk, without delay, the requi­
site number of names as aforesaid; and the names so returned shall be 
placed in the box as if returned with the poll-books. 
SEC. 5166. If all of the names of jurors be drawn from the box, or
the names of a sufficient number of jurors for the transaction of the 
business of the court for the unexpired portion of the year be not left
in the box, the judge of the court of common pleas of the county may,
during term time, or in vacation, order such number of jurors as he
may consider necessary to be apportioned among the several townships
and wards in the county, as provided by section Ji/tJ'-(Jne hundred 
and sixty-three: the clerk, after making such apportionment, shall
cause a statement in writing of the number of jurors required of each
township and ward to be forthwith delivered to the sheriff of the county,
who shall forthwith serve the same upon the trustees and councilmen,
and return it, as a summons is served and returned; and the trustees of
the several townships, and the councilmen of the several wards, shall,
immediately on the receipt of the statement, proceed to select good, judi­
cious persons, having the qualifications of an elector, who were not
selected at the previous fall election, to the number required of their
respective townships and wards, and transmit a list of the names of per­
sons so selected to the clerk of the court. 
SEC. 5167. The clerk of the court shall, within five days from the

receipt o t e ists, write t e name o eac person so se ecte upon a sep-
arate piece of paper, which he shall put into a box, to be provided by 
him at the expense of. the county, and securely kept for the purpose,
and shall, at the clerk's office, between the hours of ten o'clock fore-
noon, and twelve o'clock noon, on the fourth Monday previous to the
sitting of the court of common pleas, in the presence of the sheriff, by
whom the box shall he shaken before the drawing is made, so as to mix
the ballots on which the names are written, and in presence of any
other citizens who may choose to attend, proceed to draw twenty-seven
ballots, the persons named on the first fifteen of which shall be sum-
moned as grand jurors, and those named on the remainder shall be sum-
moned as petit jurors; and the clerk shall forthwith issue a venire to the
sheriff, commanding him to summon the persons whose names are so
drawn to attend as jurors, at the seat of justice of the county, on the
first day of the next term of the court of common pleas holden therein,
at ten o'clock A. M., unless the judge of the court of common pleas, by
order made in vacation or term time, direct on what day of the term the
petit jurors shall appear, whereupon the clerk shall issue a venire
accordingly. 
SEC. 5168. Unless the clerk is satisfied that a jury will not be
required, he shall, between the same hours, at the saf!le. place, and ~n 
the same presence, on the fourth Monday before the sitting of the dis-
trict court in his county, in like manner draw the names of twelve per-
sons to serve as jurors at that term; upon the receipt of an order of
the judge of the court of common pleas, he shall forthwith, in like man-
ner, at the same place, and in the same presence, draw the names of
twelve persons to serve as petit jurors, or twenty-seven persons to serve
as grand or petit jurors, for a special term of said court; upon the
order of the district court, or court of common pleas, at any special
term, he shall forthwith, in like manner, draw the names of the num-
ber of persons named in the order, to serve as jurors at such term;
and in every such case he shall issue his venire for the appearance of
the jurors at the proper time and place. 
SEC. 5169. If the venire be issued in vacation, the sheriff shall
summon the persons named therein at least ten days before the sitting
of court, and if it be issued in term he shall summon them forthwith ;
he shall indorse on the venire the names of the jurors, and the time
and manner of service, and return the same to the clerk forthwith, if
issued in term, or on the first day of the term, if issued in vacation;
and service may be made by reading the venire to the persons named
therein, or by leaving at their usual place of abode a note or memo­
randum substantially as follows, to wit: I am commanded to summon 
you, -- ---, to appear before the --- f insert llu namr of the
court], to be holden in --, on the -- day o( --, A. D. --, at
ten o'clock A. M., to serve as a grand or petit juror, as the case may 
be. 
SEC. 5170. If any person selected as a grand or petit juror as afore­
said be not summoned, or, if summoned, be excused from serving at 
the term to which he is summoned, his name, unless he is exempt from
serving as a juror by law, shall be returned to the box, and shall remain
there until drawn out at some subsequent drawing; and when his name
is again drawn he shall serve, unless disabled or excused. 
SEC. 5171. If, by reason of challenge, or for other cause, there be
not present a sufficient number of jurors, summoned as aforesaid, to 
make up the panel, whether of the grand or petit jury, or if the array
be challenged and set aside, the sheriff shall summon a sufficient num­
ber of talesmen to make up the deficiency; or, if there be such defi­
ciency in the grand jury, the court may issue a special venire to the
sheriff, commanding him to summon the persons therein named to attend
forthwith as grand jurors ; and at the close of each term of the court,
all persons who have served on either jury for such term, together with
those who are found permanently disabled, disqualified, or not liable to
serve, shall be discharged. 
SEC. 5172. When the court, or a judge thereof, deems it necessary
to have two petit juries, or when; by reason of sickness, the setting aside 
of an array, absence, or for other cause, it becomes necessary to have a
new petit jury, or a member to fill up the regular panel thereof for the
term, the court, or a judge thereof, may order the names of the number
of jurors required to be drawn from the box by the clerk, as in other
cases, and a venire issued to summon them to appear as may be directed
by the court, or a judge thereof. 
SEC. 5173. When it is necessary to summon talesmen, the court,
on motion of either party, shall select them, and cause to he issued im­ 
mediately a venire for as many persons having the qualifications of a
juror as, in the opinion of the court, may be necessary, which jurors
shall be required to appear forthwith, or at such time as may be fixed
by the court; but no person known to be in or about the court house
shall be selected, without the consent of both parties. 
SEC. 5174. When the sheriff is interested in a cause in any court of
record, the party in interest opposed to that of the sheriff may apply to
the court for a special venire, which, upon such application, the court
shall direct to be issued to the coroner of the county, commanding him
to summon a jury, having the qualifications hereinbefore prescribed, to
try such cause ; and when both the sheriff and coroner are so inter-
ested, or in case of the death, resignation, or absence from the county
of both the sheriff and coroner, then, and in either of such cases, the
process may be directed to such discreet, disinterested person as the
court may name, and the service and return of such person shall be
valid to all intents and purposes. 
SEC. 5176. A challenge to the array may be made, and the whole
array set aside by the court, when the jury, grand or petit, was not
selected, drawn, or summoned, or when the officer who executed the
venire did not proceed, as prescribed by law, or for the misnomer of
a juror or of jurors; but such challenge shall only be made before the
jury is impaneled and sworn ; and no indictment shall be quashed or
set aside for any such irregularity or misnomer, if the jurors who found
the same possessed, in fact, the required qualifications to act as jurors. 

SEC. 5178. the following shall be good cause for challenge to any
person called as a juror for the trial of any cause: 
1. That he has been convicted of a crime which by the law renders
him disqualified to serve on a jury. 
2. That he has an interesi: in the cause.
3. That he has an action pending between him and either party.
4. That he has formerly been a juror in the same cause. ·
5. That he is the employer, employe, counselor, agent, steward, or 
attorney of either party.
6. That he is subpeenaed in good faith in the cause as a witness.
7. That he is akin to either party, or to his attorney.
8. That he is a party to an action. pending in the court, and has 
employed or retained in his action an attorney in the cause in which he
is called as a juror. 
9. That he, not being a regular juror of the term, has served once
already on a jury as a talesman in the trial of any cause, in any court
of record in the county, within the preceding twelve months; and in
either of said cases the same shall be considered as a principal challenge,
and the validity thereof tried by the court. f 7 3 V. 20, § 1.] 
SEC. 5177. Any petit juror may be challenged also on suspicion 
of prejudice against, or partiality for, either party, or for want of a
competent knowledge of the English language, or for any other cause
that may render him at the time an unsuitable juror, and the validity
of such challenge shall be determined by the court; and each party
may peremptorily challenge two jurors. 
SEc. 5178. A person summoned as a juror, who, without reason­
able and lawf u1 cause, to be judged of by the court, refuses to serve,
shall be fined in any sum not exceeding thirty dollars, as for a contempt
of court; a juror, after being qualified, who refuses or neglects to obey
or observe any order or injunction of the court, may be fined as for
contempt. in any sum, in its discretion, not exceeding one thousand
dollars: and any fine so assessed may be collected by execution, and
sha1l be paid into the county treasury and disbursed as other fines. 

SEC. 5179. A person who serves as a juror, grand or petit, or both,
in the courts of this state, for three weeks in any year, shall be exempt
from further service as a juror during the balance of the year; but
nothing herein contained shal1 entitle a juror to be discharged from the
grand jury during its session, or from a petit jury during the trial of a 
cause, 
SEC. 5180. Public officers, clergymen and priests, physicians,
attorneys-at-law, members of the police force or firemen employed by
the authority of a municipal corporation, acting volunteer members of
companies for the extinguishment of fires, organized under and subject
to the control of a municipal corporation, and persons who serve as
active members of such companies for five consecutive years, shall he 
exempt from service on juries. 

SEC. 5181. No officer shall be allowed compensation for services
under this chapter other than that allowed by law; and any officer
named in this chapter who refuses or neglects to perform any duty
therein required, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred 
dollars. 
SEC. 5182. Each grand and petit juror shall be allowed the sum
of two dollars per day for each day he serves, and, if not a talesman.
five cents per mile from his place of residence lo the county seat; a tales­
man on a petit jury sha1l receive one do1lar per day for each day he
serves; and such compensation shall be certified by the clerk of the 
court, and paid by the county treasurer, on the warrant of the county
auditor. 
SEC. 6183. In a civil action, the party in whose favor a verdict is
rendered, or, when a non-suit is ordered, the party who called a jury, 
shall pay to the sheriff six dollars, to be taxed in the costs.. before the
verdict or judgment is entered; the sheriff shall pay the same to the
county treasurer, unless orders are not being redeemed at the county
treasury, in which case he shall pay to each juror fifty cents; and the
clerk, in issuing certificates of service to jurors, shall deduct amounts 
so paid to the jury. 
SEC. 6184. The clerk shall, within twenty days after the adjourn-
ment of each term of court deliver to the auditor a statement of the 
 , , ,  . number of civil cases tried to a Jury at that term; and the auditor
shall charge the sheriff, in a book to be provided for that purpose, six
dollars for each case so tried, and shall credit the sheriff therein with
the jury fees paid as provided in the preceding section. 
SEC. 6186. Any party to an action may demand a struck jury for
the trial of an issue of fact therein, by filing a precipe with the clerk; 
thereupon the clerk shall proceed to the office of the county auditor,
and there take to his assistance the county auditor and recorder in the
selection of the list of names for such jury, which three officers shall
select, from the qualified electors of the county, the names of forty
persons, impartial between the parties, and who, from their intelligence
and sound judgment, are believed to be well qualified to try the cause;
the auditor shall make and preserve in his office a list of the names
of the persons so selected; and the clerk shall, without delay, give four
days' notice to both parties, or their attorneys of record, of the time of
striking the jury, and furnish to each at the same time a true copy of
such list. 
SEC. 6186. At the time designated, the. clerk shall attend at his
office for the purpose of striking the jury, when the party demanding 
the jury. or his agent or attorney, shall strike off one name from the
list, and the opposite party, his agent or attorney, another, and so on
alternately until each shall have struck off twelve; if either party fail
or refuse to attend or strike, in person or otherwise, the c1erk shall strike
for him; when twenty-four names have been stricken off, the clerk
shall make a fair copy of the remaining sixteen names, certify them to
be the list of the jurors struck for the trial of the cause, and deliver
the same to the sheriff, or other proper officer, together with the venire;
and such officer shall annex the names therein contained to the venire,
and summon the persons named as commanded. 
SEC. 6187. Upon the trial of the cause, the names of the jurors
shall be called as they stand upon the panel, which order must be the 
same as that of the list at the time of striking the jury, and the first
twelve of those who appear, and are not challenged for cause, or set
aside by the court, shall be the jury, and shall be sworn as such; but if
a jury be not made from such sixteen jurors, the sheriff shall, under the 
direction of the court, fill up the panel from the bystanders, or, on
motion of either party, the court shall select the persons to fill the panel,
and issue a special vcnire therefor, returnable forthwith. 

SEc. 5188. If the clerk. auditor, or recorder, is interested in the
cause, sick, absent from the county, related to either of the parties, or
does not stand indifferent between them, a judge entitled to hold such
court may, in term time or vacation, appoint some judicious, disinter·
ested person to take the place of the officer so disqualified, in selecting
and striking the jury, and to do and perform all things required to be
done . by such officer when acting in that behalf; but it shall not
be necessary to strike such jury more than six days previous to the sit­
ting of the court at which the cause is to be tried; and three days'
service of the venire shall be sufficient. 
SEc. 5189. The party who requires a struck jury shall pay the fees
for striking, summoning, impaneling, and qualifying the same, and one­
half of all the fees of such jury ; and a jury struck as aforesaid may
be continued with the continuance of the cause, and be required to
appear as jurors for the trial thereof at a subsequent term, unless the
court otherwise order, upon good cause shown. 

SEC. 5190. When the jury is sworn, the trial shall proceed, except
as provided in the next section, in the following order, unless the court
for special reasons otherwise direct : 
1. The plaintiff must briefly state his claim, and may briefly state
the evidence by which he expects to sustain it. 
2. The defendant must then briefly state his defense, and may briefly
state the evidence he expects to offer in support of it. 
· 3. The party who would be defeated if no evidence were offered on 
either side, must first produce his evidence; and the adverse party
must then produce his evidence. 
4. The parties shall then be confined to rebutting evidence, unless
the court, for good reasons, in the furtherance of justice, permit them
to offer evidence in their original case. 
5. When the evidence is concluded, either party may request
instruction to the jury on matters of law, which shall be given or
ref used by the court. 
6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to the jury; the
party required first to produce his evidence shall have the opening and 
closing argument; and if several defendants, having separate defenses,
appear by different counsel, the court shall arrange their relative order. 
7. The court, after the argument is concluded, shall, before proceeding
with other business, charge the jury; an)' charge shall be reduced to
writing by the court, if either party, before the argument to the jury is
commenced, request it; a charge or instruction, when so written and
given, shall not be orally qualified, modified, or in any manner explained 
to the jury by the court ; and all written charges and instructions shall
be taken by the jurors in their retirement, and returned with their ver­
dict into court, and shall remain on file with the papers of the case. 

SEC. 5191. The court, when of opinion it is proper for the jurors
to have a view of the property which is the subject of litigation, or of 
the place in which any material fact occurred, may order them to be
conducted in a body, under the charge of an officer, to the place, which
shall be shown to them by a person appointed by the court for that pur-
pose; and while the jurors are thus absent, no person, other than the
person so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected 
with the trial. 
SEC. 5192. When the case is submitted, the jury may decide in
court, or retire for deliberation ; if the jurors retire, they must be kept 
together in some convenient place, under the charge of an officer,
until they agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by the court, subject
to the discretion of the court to permit them to separate temporarily at
night, and at their meals; the officer having them under his charge 
shall not suffer any communication to be made to them, nor make any
himself, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, 
unless by order of the court; and he shall not, before their verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations,
or the verdict agreed upon. 
SEC. 5193. If the jurors be permitted to separate. either during
the trial, or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admon- 
ished by the court that it is their duty not to converse with, nor suffer
themselves to be addressed by, any other person, on any subject of the
trial, and that it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon,
until the cause is finally submitted to them. 
SEC. 5194. After the jurors have retired for deliberation, if there
be a disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if 
they desire to be informed as to any part of the law arising in the case,
they may request the officer to conduct them to the court, where the 
information upon the matter of law shall be given; and the court may 
give its recollection as to the testimony on the point in dispute, in the
presence of, or after notice to, the parties or their counsel. Ls1 v. 57, 

SEc. 5195. The jury may be discharged by the court on account
of the sickness of a juror, or any accident or calamity requiring its
discharge, or by consent of both parties, or after the jurors have been
kept together until it satisfactorily appears that there is no probability 
of their agreeing. 
SEC. 5196. When the jury is discharged after the cause is submit­
ted, or during the trial, the cause may he tried again immediately, or 
at a future time, as the court may direct. 
SEC. 5197. When the jurors agree upon their verdict, rt must be
reduced to writing, and signed by the foreman ; they must then be
conducted into court, their names called hy the clerk, and the verdict
rendered by the foreman ; and the clerk must read the verdict to the
jury, and make inquiry whether it is their verdict. 
SEC. 5198. If a juror disagree, or if, when the jury is polled. a
juror answer in the negative, or if the verdict is defective in matter of
substance, the jury must be sent out again, for further deliberation; and

the clerk or court asking each juror if it is his verdict. 

SEc. 5199. If no disagreement be expressed, and neither party
require the jury to be polled, or, on the polling, each juror answer in
the affirmative, the verdict is complete, and the jury shall be discharged
from the case; and if the verdict be defective in form only, it may,
with the assent of the jurors, before they are discharged, he corrected 
by the court. 
SEc. 5200. The verdict of a jury must he either general or special; 
a general verdict is that by which the jury finds, generally, upon all or
any of the issues, in favor of either the plaintiff or defendant; a special
verdict is that by which the jury finds the facts only, and it must pre­
sent the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to
prove the facts; and the facts must be so presented that nothing shall
remain to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law. 
SEC. 5201. In actions for the recovery of money only, or specific
real property, the jury may render either a general or a special verdict;
in all other cases the court may direct the jury to find a special verdict,
in writing, upon all or any of the issues; in all cases the court may
instruct the jurors, if they render a general verdict, to find upon 'par­ 
ticular questions of fact, to be stated in writing, and may direct a writ­
ten finding thereon; and the verdict or finding must be filed with the
clerk, and entered on the journal. 
SEc. 5202. When the special finding of facts is inconsistent
with the general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the
court may give judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 5203. When, by the verdict, either party is entitled to
recover money of the adverse party, the jury, in its verdict, must 
assess the amount of recovery. 
SUBDIVISlON III. TRIAL BY THE COURT.

fails to appear at the trial, by himself or attorney. 
2. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the
clerk. 
3. By oral consent in open court, entered on the journal. 
SEC. 5205. Upon the trial of questions of fact by the court, it
shall not be necessary for the court to state its finding, except, gener­ 
ally, for the plaintiff or defendant, unless one of the parties request it, 
with the view of excepting to the decision of the court upon the ques­
tions of law involved in the trial, in which case the court shall state in
writing the conclusions of fact found, separately from the conclusions 
of law .

civil action may, without action, agrt'e upon a case containing the facts
upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission of the
same to any court which would have jurisdiction if an action were
brought; hut it must appear by affidavit that the controversy is real,
and the proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights of the par­
ties; and the court shall, thereupon, hear and determine the case, 
and render judgment, as if an action were pending. 
SEC. 5208. The case, the submission, and the judgment, shal
constitute the record. 
SEC. 5209. The judgment shall be with costs, may be enforced,
and shall be subject to reversal, in the same manner as if it had been
rendered in an action, unless otherwise provided in the submission. 

SEc. 5210. All or any of the issues in the action or proceeding,
whether of fact or of law, or both, may be referred by the court, or
a judge thereof in vacation, upon the written consent of the parties,
or upon their oral consent in court, entered upon the journal. 
SEC. 5211. When the parties do not consent, the court, or a judge 
thereof in vacation. may, upon the application of a party. or of its or
his motion, direct a reference in any case in which the parties are not
entitled by the «onstitution to a trial by jury. 

SEC. 5212. If a referee die, or be disabled, or refuse to serve, a
judge of the court in which the action is pending may, in vacation,
appoint another person to take his place, or again direct a reference as

manner; their report upon the whole issue shall stand as the decision
of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same man-
ner as if the action had been tried by the court; when the reference is
to report the facts, the report shall have the effect of a special verdict;
and, when the court directs it to be done, the referee shall reduce the
testimony of the witnesses to writing, and require them severally to
subscribe the same. 
SEC. 5214. In all cases of reference, except when an infant is a
party, the parties may agree upon a suitable person or persons, not 
exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered accordingly; and 
if the parties do not agree, the court shall appoint referees, not exceed-
ing three, who shall be free from exception. (51 v. 57, § 284.] 
SEC. 5215. A reference as provided in this chapter can not be
ordered by a probate court, unless by consent of the parties to the ref- 
erence, and the referees. 
SEC. 5216. The referees shall sign any true exceptions taken to an
order or decision by them made in the case, and return the same with 
their report to the court which made the reference. (51 v. 5 7, § 286.] 
SEC. 5217. The referees must be sworn well and faithfully to hear
and examine the cause, and to make a just and true report therein, 
according to the best of their understanding; and the oath may be
administered by any person authorized to take depositions. 

SEC. 5218. The referees shall be allowed such compensation for
their services as the court deems just and proper, which shall be taxed 
as a part of the costs in the case.

that he will pay over all money, and faithfully discharge the duties of
his office; the court may, at any time, require a master commis­
sioner to give other or further security, and in default thereof, by a day

and upon the same pleadings, unless amendments are permitted or
ordered by the court. (65 v. 211, § 1; 50 v, 93, ~ 11.] 
SEc. 6226. In addition to the cases and matters specially provided
for, such appeal may be taken, by a party ot other person directly
affected, from a judgment or final order in a civil action rendered by
the court of common pleas, and of which it had original jurisdiction,
if the right to demand a jury therein did not exist. and from an inter­
locutory order, made by the court of common pleas, or a judge thereof,
dissolving an injunction, in a case of which that court had original
jurisdiction; but such interlocutory order dissolving such injunction
shall not be suspended by the appeal, except by order of the district
court, or any two judges thereof in vacation, on notice to the adverse
party. 
SEC. 5227. A party desiring to appeal his cause to the district
court shall, at the term in which the judgment or order is rendered,

this state, with sureties according to law, shall not be required to give
bond and security to perfect an appeal ; and in such cases the clerk,
at the expiration of thirty days from the rising of the court, shall, if 
not otherwise directed, make a transcript, which, together with the
papers and pleadings filed in the cause, he shall transmit to the clerk 
of the district court, as in other cases of appeal. 

SEc. 6229. When a party to a judgment has given notice as afore·
said_, and dies within the ~i~1e limited for the appeal, and before per-

and within ninety days after the death of such party, may cause notice
of his intention, as such administrator or executor, to appeal the cause,
to be entered upon the journal of the court; and such administrator
or executor shall thereby be made a party to the judgment, and the 
appeal shall be considered as !v-~.-cted. 
SEC. 6230. When the judgment is personal against a party for the
payment of money only, the penalty of the appeal bond shall be 

ou le t e amount o t e JU gment; m a ot er cases, mclu mg cases

tion of the judgment, ascertain and fix the penalty of the appeal

the delay, and the costs and damages which may be awarded in the 
appellate court.
SEc. 6231. The appeal bond shall be payable to the adverse party,
or otherwise as may be directed by the court where the conflicting 
, , 
interests of tbe parties require it, and shall be subject to a condition to

and damages which may be required of or awarded against him by 
such court.

shall be fixed accordingly; and the court shall make such order as to
the papers and pleadings, the supplying of copies thereof, and in all
other respects, in view of a division of the case for the purpose of 
appeal, as it deems right and proper. lso v, 93, § 4.] 
SEC. 6233. When the surety in the undertaking for the appeal has
removed from the state, or for any cause is insufficient, or if the under-
taking is insufficient in form or amount, the district court, on motion, 
may order a change or renewal of the undertaking, or a new under­
taking to be given, with security, to be approved by said court, or the
clerk thereof; and if the order of the court be complied with, the
appeal shall not be dismissed, but the court shall hear and determine
the cause in the same manner as if the order had not been made; but 
otherwise the appeal shall be dismissed. (54 v. 95, § 1.] 
SEC. 5234. The court may, on motion of the party entering notice
of appeal, on such reasonable terms as may be necessary for the security
of the adverse party, direct execution to be stayed for thirty days.

ment is thereby suspended, and the clerk shall forthwith make an authen­
ticated transcript of the docket and journal entries, and of the final
judgment, which transcript, together with the original papers and plead-
ings, he shall deliver at the office of the clerk of the district court, on
or before the first day of the term thereof next after the appeal is per­
fected; and either party may require a full record to be made of the
case in the court below, at his own costs. (50 v, 93, § 9.] 
SEC. 5236. When the party against whom a judgment is rendered
appeals his cause to the district court, the lien of the opposite party on 
the real estate of the appellant, created by the judgment, shall not be
removed or vacated by the appeal; but the real estate of the appellant
shall be bound, in the same manner as if the appeal had not been taken,
until the final determination of the cause in the district court.
SEc. 5237. If a plaintiff appealing do not recover a. greater sum
in the district court than in the court from which appeal was taken, 
exclusive of costs and interest accrued since the rendition of the
judgment, he shall pay all costs that accrue in the district court; and

and the plaintiff recover the same or a larger sum than was recovered
in the court below, exclusive of costs, the district court shall render 
judgment for the sum so recovered, with costs of suit. r 50 v. 93, ~ 8.] 
SEC. 5238. When the appellate court renders sulJstantially the
same judgment which was rendered in the court below, damages may
be awarded as follows: When the judgment is for the payment of
money, the appellant shall be adjudged to pay the appellee, or party
delayed of payment by the appeal, damages at the rate of five per cent.
on the amount adjudged in the court below, unless the appellate court
is satisfied that there was reasonable ground for the appeal; and in such
case, when the court is satisfied that the appeal was for the purpose of
delay merely, the damages adjudged shall be at the rate of ten per cent.;
in all other cases, including those where the judgment or decree is for
nominal damages and costs, or costs only, unless the appellate court is
satisfied that there was reasonable and probable ground for the appeal,
damages shall be adjudged to the appellee, or party affected by the
appeal, in such specific sum as may be deemed reasonable, not exceed- 
ing two hundred dollars. 
SEC. 5239. When the district court makes a final order, or renders
final judgment, it may enforce the same by process issued therefrom,
or may remand the same to the court of common pleas for execution 
or other process ; the clerk of the district court shall certify the same
to the court of common pleas, and the clerk of that court, on the receipt
of the certified transcript, shall immediately enter the same 'on the
journal; and the judgment or order so entered, unless otherwise
directed by the district court, shall, for the purpose of execution, and
other process, stand as the judgment of the court of common pleas.

which is filed with a pleading, as provided in section.five thousand and 
eighlyjive.
SEC. 5293. When a person claiming to have a cause of action, or
a defense to an action commenced against him, is unable, without a

and such interrogatories relating to the subject matter of the discovery
as may be necessary to procure the discovery sought, which, if not
demurred to, shall be fully and directly answered under oath by the
defendant; and upon the final disposition of the action, the costs
thereof shall be taxed in such manner as the court deems equitable. 

SUBDIVISION V. VARIANCE. 
SEC. 5294. No variance between the allegation in .a pleading, and
the proof, shall be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the
adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense
upon the raerits, and when it is alleged that a party has been so mis­
led, that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and it 
must also be shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon
the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as 
are just. 
SEc. 5295. When the variance is not material, the court mav direct
the fact to be found according to the evidence, and may order an imme­ 
diate amendment without costs.

SEC. 5307. The application for a new trial must be made at the

debts, and shall be liable to be taken on execution and sold as herein· 
after provided. r37 V. 44, § I j 51 V. 57, § 420.] 
SEc. 5375. Such lands and tenements, within :he county where
the judgment is entered, shall be bound for the satisfaction thereof from 
the first day of the the term at which judgment is rendered; but judg­
ments by confession, and judgments rendered at the same term at
which the action is commenced, shall bind such lands only from the day
on which such judgments are rendered; and all other lands, as well as
goods and chattels of the debtor, shall be bound from the time they are 
seized in execution. 
SEC. 6376. A judgment of the supreme court, for money, shall
bind the lands and tenements of the debtor, within the county in which
the suit originated, from the first day of the term .at which the judg­
ment is entered, and all other lands, and the goods and chattels, of the
debtor, from the time they are seized in execution; but the lien of a
judgment of the court of common pleas, in an action which is appealed
by the judgment debtor to the district court, and is thence removed
into the supreme court, shall not be thereby divested or vacated, but
shall continue till the final determination of the action in the supreme 
court. 
SEc. 5377. The party in whose favor a judgment is rendered by a
justice of the peace, or mayor of a municipal corporation, may, at any
time after the day the judgment is rendered, if the same be not appealed
or stayed, file in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of
the county in which the judgment was rendered a transcript thereof,
having certified therein the amount, if any, paid thereon; and there·
upon the clerk shall enter the case on the execution docket, together
with the amount of the judgment, and the time of filing the transcript;
but if, within ten days after the rendition of the judgment, the judgment
debtor pay the same, or give bail for stay of execution, the justice or
mayor shall forthwith certify that fact to the clerk of the court of com·
mon pleas, who shall enter a memorandum thereof upon the execution
docket; and the cost of the transcript, the filing thereof, and of the
entry on the docket, shall be paid by the party who files the transcript, 
and not be taxed to the other party. 
SEc. 5378. Such judgment, if the transcript be filed in term time, 
shall be a lien on the real estate of the judgment debtor within the
county from the day the transcript is filed; and if filed in vacation, the
judgment shall, as against the debtor, be a lien from the day it is filed,
but as against other transcripts filed in vacation, and judgments ren­
dered at the next term of the court, it shall be a lien only from the 
first day of the next term. 
SEC. 5379. Execution may be issued on such. judgment at any
time after filing the transcript, as if the judgment had been rendered in
court; but the lien shall remain as provided in the preceding section. 

SEC. 5380. If execution on a judgment rendered in any court of
record in this state, or a transcript of which has been filed as provided 
in section fifty-three hundrtd and saetuy-sercn, be not sued out within
five years from the date of the judgment, or if five years intervene
between the date of the last execution issued on such judgment and the
time of suing out another execution thereon, such judgment shall become
dormant, and shall cease to operate as a lien on the estate of the judg­ 
ment debtor. 
SEC. 5381. The writ of execution against the property of the judg-
ment debtor, issuing from any court of record, shall command the officer 
to whom it is directed that of the goods and chattels of the debtor he
cause to be made the money specified in the writ, and, for want of 
goods and chattels, that he cause the same to be made of the lands and
tenements of the debtor; but an execution issued on a judgment rendered
against a partnership, by its firm name, shall operate only on the part-
nership property; and the exact amount of the debt, damages, and costs
for which the judgment is entered shall be indorsed on the execution. 

SEC. 5382. When two or. more writs of execution against the same
debtor are sued out during the term in which judgment was rendered, 
or within ten days thereafter, and when two or more writs of execution
against the same debtor are delivered to the officer on the same day, no
preference shall be given to either of such writs; but if a sufficient sum
of money he not made to satisfy all executions, the amount made shall
be distributed to the several creditors in proportion to the amount of
their respective demands; in all other cases the writ of execution first
delivered to the officer shall be first satisfied; and the officer shall indorse
on every writ of execution the time when he received the same; but
nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to affect any prefer-
able lien which a judgment on which execution issued has on the· lands 
of the judgment debtor. 
SEC. 5383. The officer to whom a writ of execution is delivered
shall proceed. immediately, to levy the same upon the goods and chat- 
. 
tels of the de btor ; but if no goods and chattels can be found, the
officer shall indorse on the execution the words '' no goods," and forth- 
with levy the same upon the lands and tenements of the debtor which
are liable to satisfy the judgment. (51 v. 57, ~ 425. l 
SEC. 5384. When a sheriff, coroner, or other officer levies, by vir-
tue of an execution, upon any goods and chattels which afterward 

remain upon 11s ran s unso tor want o H ers, ror t e want o time 
to advertise and sell, or for any other reasonable cause, the officer may,
for his own security, take of the defendant an undertaking, with secu- 
rity, in such sum as he deems sufficient, to the effect that the property
shall he delivered to the officer holding an execution for the sale of the 
same, at the time and place appointed by such officer, either by notice
given in writing to the defendant in execution, or by advertisement
published in a newspaper printed in the county, naming therein the day
and place of sale; and if the defendant fail to deliver the goods and 
chattels at the time and place mentioned in the notice to him given, or
to pay to the officer holding the execution the full value of such goods 
and chattels, or the amount of the debt and costs, the undertaking shall
be considered as broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases. 

SEC. 5385. The officer who levies upon goods and chattels by
virtue of an execution issued by ~ c.:ou~t of recor? shall, befor~ he pro-
ceeds to sell the same, cause public notice to be given of the time and
place of sale, for at least kn days before the day of sale, which notice 
shall be given by advertisement published in a newspaper printed in
the county, or, if no newspaper is printed therein, by posting adver­
tisements in five public places in the county, two of which shall be put
up in the township where the sale is to be held. 
SEc. 6386. When goods and chattels levied upon by execution can
not be sold for want of bidders, or want of time, the officer who makes
the return shall annex to the execution a true and perfect inventory of
the goods and chattels remaining unsold; and the plaintiff in such exe­
cution may thereupon have another execution issued, directing the sale
of the property levied upon; but such goods and chattels shall not be
sold unless the time and place of sale be advertised as directed in the 
preceding section. 
SEC. 6387. All sales of goods and chattels shall he at public auc­
tion; but the court from which an execution or order of sale issues, or 
a judge thereof in vacation, may, on good cause shown, on application
of either party, and due notice to the adverse party, make an order
directing the sheriff, or other officer holding the process. to sell such
goods and chattels at private sale for cash, specifying the time, not
extending beyond the return day of the process, during which such sale 
will continue; but before such private sale is made, the court shall
order such personal property to he appraised by three disinterested per­
sons; and the property shall not be so sold for less than two-thirds the 
appraised value thereof. 
SEC. 5388. When a writ is issued directing the sale of property 
previously taken in execution, the officer who issues the writ shall, if
requested by the person entitled to the benefit thereof, or his agent or
attorney, add thereto a command to the officer to whom the writ is
directed, that if, in his opinion, the property remaining in his hands
not sold is insufficient to satisfy the judgment, he shall levy the same
upon lands and tenements, goods and chattels, or either, of the judg­
ment debtor, as the law permits, sufficient to satisfy the debt. 

SEC. 6389. When execution is levied upon lands and tenements, 
the officer who makes the levy shall call an inquest of three disinter­
ested freeholders, who shall be residents of the county where the lands
taken in execution are situate, and administer to them an oath impar- 
tially to appraise the property so levied upon, upon actual view; and
such freeholders shall forthwith return to such officer, under their hands,
an estimate of the real value of the property in money. 
SEC. 6390. When the officer receives the return he shall forth-
with deposit a copy thereof with the clerk of the court from which the 

wnt issue , an imme rate y a vernse an se sue rea estate, agree-

which the execution issued shall not operate as a hen on the residue of
the debtor's estate, to the prejudice of any other judgment creditor; 
but no tract of land shall be sold fur less than two-thirds of the value
returned in the inquest; and nothing in this section contained shall
affect the sale of lands by the state ; but all lands, the property of indi- 
viduals indebted to the state for an}' debt or taxes or in any other man-

the peace, or constable, or of a collector of state, county, municipal

money by him collected or received in his official capacity, the prop-
erty so levied on shall be sold without valuation. 
SEC. 5393. Lands and tenements taken in execution shall not be
sold until the officer causes to be given public notice of the time and 
place of sale, for at least thirty days before the day of sale, by adver-
tisement in a newspaper printed and of general circulation in the
county, or, if no newspaper is printed in the county, in a newspaper
of general circulation therein, and by putting up an advertisement of
the same upon the court-house door, and in five other public places in
the county, two of which shall be in the township where the lands and
tenements are situate; when the advertisement is made in a newspaper
published weekly, it shall be sufficient to insert it in five consecutive
numbers thereof; but if there is published both a daily and weekly
edition of the newspaper selected for such advertisement, and the cir-
culation of the daily in the county excee-rs that of the weekly, or, if
the lands and tenements taken in execution are situate in any city in
this state, and there is published both a daily and weekly edition of the
newpspaper selected for such advertisement, and the circulation of the
daily in such city exceeds that of the weekly, it shall be sufficient to
publish the advertisement in the daily once a week, for five consecutive
weeks, before the day of sale, each insertion to be on the same day of
the week; but the e-.;pense of such publication in a daily newspaper
shall not exceed the cost of publishing the same in a weekly newspaper;
and all sales made without such advertisement shall be set aside, on
motion, by the court to which the execution is returnable. 

SEc. 5394. In any county in which there is a city wherein is printed
and published a newspaper in the German language. which was estab­
lished and issued before the seventeenth day of April, one thousand

publication therein required, be published in such newspaper in the
German language. for the same time, and in the same manner, if the
appraised value of the property to he sold exceeds five hundred dollars.
and if two or more such papers are printed and published therein, the
publication may be in either; but the court shall, on motion of the
defendant, and may without motion, for good cause, dispense with such
publication; and in any county the court may. if it deem the interests
of the defendant require it. direct the publication of the notice in a
newspaper printed in the Bohemian language, in addition to the publi­
cation required hy the preceding section; hut no error or mistake in
translation, or in any publication authorized by this section, shall delay

or mistake occur hy the negligence of the publisher, he shall not be 
entitled to compensation for the publication. 
SEC. 5395. The sheriff shall indorse on the writ his proceedings
thereon, and the clerk shall immediately, upon the return thereof, record

satisfaction of which lands and tenements have Leen sold, it be found

officer, that the sale has been made. in all respects, in conformity
to the provisions of this title, the clerk shall be directed to make an
entry on the journal that the court is satisfied of the legality of such 
sale, and that the officer make to the purchaser a deed for the lands
and tenements; and the officer, on making the sale, may retain the
purchase money in his hands until the court examines his proceedings,
when he shall pay the same to the person entitled thereto, agreeably to 
the order of the court. (51 v. 57, § 43 7.]

of the officer's return thereon, and the order of confirmation; and the
deed shall be executed, acknowledged, and recorded as is provided 
with respect to other deeds. 
SEC. 5402. The deed shall be prima facie evidence of the legality
and regularity of the sale; and all the estate and interest of the person

interest existed at the time the property became liable to satisfy the
judgment, or was acquired subsequently, shall he thereby vested in the 
purchaser.
SEC. 5403. The officer who makes a levy, or holds an order of sale,

of the creditor whose execution may, by the provisions of this chapter,
be entitled to a preference, shall have the choice of such part of the real
property of the judgment debtor or debtors as will be sufficient, at two­
thirds of the appraised value, to satisfy the same; when two or more
executions, which are entitled to no preference as to each other, are
put in the hands of the same officer, he shall, when required, levy
the same on separate parcels of the real property of the judgment
debtor or debtors, if. in the opinion of the appraisers, the same may be
divided without material injury; and if the real property of such debtor
or debtors be not sufficient, at two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy
all the executions chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall be
levied on, to satisfy each execution, as will bear the same proportion in
value to the whole, as the amount due on the execution bears to the
amount of all the executions chargeable thereon, as near as may he. 
according to the appraised value of each separate parcel. 
SEC. 5407. If the term of service of the officer who makes sale of

the balance, if any, may execute to the purchaser, or his legal repre­
sentative, a deed of conveyance of the lands and tenements sold; and
such deed shall be as good and valid in law, and have the same effect,
as if the officer who made the sale had executed the same. 
SEC. 5408. When, on any sale made as aforesaid, there is in the
ianc S O t 1e O cer more money t ran IS SU nent to sans )' t e writ or
writs of execution, with interest and costs, the officer shall, on demand,

tives.
SEC. 5409. If a judgment, in satisfaction of which lands or tene­
merits are sold, he thereafter reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or 
affect the title of the purchaser; but in such case restitution shall be

tenements were sold, with lawful interest from the day of sale. 

SEC. 5410. If, upon the sale of property on execution, the title of

purchaser may be subrogated to the right of the creditor against the
debtor, to the extent of the money paid and applied to the debtor's 
benefit, and, to the same extent, shall have a lien on the property sold,

this section shall not be construed to require the creditor to refund the
purchase money, by reason of the invalidity of any such sales. 

SEc. 6411. The last section shall apply, also, to all sales by order
of court, sales by executors,· administrators, guardians, and assignees,

SEC. 6412. When a plaintiff in execution, or his agent, has, in good
faith, ordered a levy of execution UJ>On property not subiect thereto,

ery therefor has been had against him by the owner of the property,
the person so recovered against, and having paid the amount so recov-
ered, may, on motion in the court having control of the judgment,
upon giving the judgment defendant notice of such motion, have the
satisfaction, so made from the sale of the property on execution, vacated,

not su )Ject t ereto, an se s t e same, an app res t re procee s m sat-
isfaction, or part satisfaction, of the judgment, and a recovery is had

ing to the court that due notice of such motion has been given to the
defendant named in the execution, may 'have the satisfaction of such
judgment, so made from the sale of such property, vacated, and execu-
tion shall issue therefor, for the use of such officer, the same as if such 
levy and sale had not been made.
SEC. 6414. When a defendant in a judgment, or a surety or
co-surety of such defendant, has, by mistake, directed an execution 
issued on the judgment to be levied on property not liable to such exe-
cut ion, and thereby caused such judgment to be wholly or in part satis-
fied, and has been compelled to pay the owner of such property there-
for. he shall be adjudged to have the same rights against any co-defend-
ant in such judgment, and against any co-surety or principal in respect
of the debts on which such judgment is founded, as though such satis-
faction had, by due process of law, been made out of the property of
such defendant, surety, or co-surety, so directing such levy. 

SEc. 5415. No judgment, on which execution is not issued and
levied before the expiration of one year next after its rendition, shall 
operate as a lien on the estate of a debtor to the prejudice of any other
bona fide judgment creditor; but in all cases in which judgment is ren- 
dered in the district or supreme court, and a special mandate is awarded
to the court of common pleas to carry the same into execution, the lien
of the judgment creditor shall continue for one year after the first day
of the term of the court of common pleas to which such mandate is
directed, or, if the mandate be entered on the journal in vacation,
after it is so entered; and in computing such period of one year, the
time covered by an appeal of the case, or by an injunction against the
execution, or by proceedings in error, or by a vacancy in the office of
sheriff and coroner, or by the inability of such officers, shall he 
excluded. 
SEC. 6416. When real estate, taken on execution and appraised, 
and twice advertised and offered for sale, remains unsold for want of
bidders, the court from which the execution issued shall, on motion of
the plaintiff, set aside such appraisement, and order a new appraise­
ment to he made, or set aside such levy and appraisernent, and award
a new execution to issue, as the case may require : and when such real
estate, or any part thereof, has been three times appraised as aforesaid,
and thereafter twice advertised and offered for sale, and then remains
unsold for want of bidders. the court may direct the amount for which 
the same shall be sold. 
SEC. 6417. When premises are orderecf to be sold, and having been
twice advertised and offered for sale, remain unsold for want of bid­
ders, the court frcm which the order of sale issued shall, on motion of

order that the land be sold on time, as follows: One-third cash in
hand, one-third in nine months from the day of sale, and the remain­
ing third in eighteen months from the day of sale, the deferred pay­
ments to draw six per cent. interest, and to be secured by mortgage on 
the premises. 
SEC. 6418. The officer to w110m a writ of execution is directed 
shall return such writ to the court to which it is returnable within sixty
days from the date thereof. 
SEC. 5419. When judgment is rendered in a court of record
within this state, upon an instrument of writing in which two or more
persons are jointly or severally bound, and it is made to appear to the
court, by parol or other testimony, that one or more of the persons so
bound signed the same as surety or bail for his or their co-defendant,

recover his costs against the plaintiff in execution, or other party for
whose benefit the execution issued, and also that he have restitution of
the goods and chattels, or any part thereof, according to the finding of
the jury; but if the jury find that the right to the goods and chattels,
and every part thereof, is not in the claimant, the justice shall render
judgment on such finding in favor of the plaintiff in execution, or other
party for whose benefit the execution issued, and against the claimant,
for costs, and award execution thereon; if the jury fail to agree, and
be discharged, costs shall be taxed, to abide the final event of the pro­
ceeding before the justice, and another jury shall be summoned in like
manner as before; a judgment for the claimant, unless an undertaking
be executed, as provided in the next section. shall be a justification of
the officer in returning ' no goods'' to the writ of execution by virtue
of which the levy was made, as to such part of the goods and chattels
as were found to belong to the claimant; and the same fees shall be
allowed and taxed by the justice, for himself, officers, jurors, and wit­
nesses, as are allowed by law for like services in other cases,

sureties, payable to the claimant, to the effect that they will pay all

sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he docs not reside in the
state, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment was rendered, or
a transcript of a justice's judgment has been filed, is returned unsatisfied,
in whole or in part, the judgment creditor shall be entitled to an order
from a probate judge, or a judge of the court of common pleas. of the
county to which the execution was issued, requiring such debtor to
appear and answer concerning his property before such judge, or a
referee appointed by such judge, at a time and place within the county 
to be specified in the order. 
SEC. 5473. After the issue of an execution against property, and
upon proof by the affidavit of the judgment creditor, or otherwise, to the 
satisfaction of the court of common pleas, or a judge thereof, or a pro-
bate judge, of the county in which the debtor is found, that the judg-
ment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the
satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may, by order, require
the judgment debtor to appear at a time and place, in such county, to
answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be
had, for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward
the satisfaction of the judgment, as are prescribed in this subdivision. 

SEC. 5474. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the
judgment debtor, as provided in the two preceding sections, the judge 
may, upon proof, in writing, to his satisfaction, by affidavit of the judg-
ment creditor, or otherwise, that there is danger of the debtor leaving
the state, or concealing himself, to avoid the examination herein men-
tioned, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff to arrest and bring before
him the debtor: such warrant can be issued only by a judge of the court
of common picas, or the probate judge, of a county in which the debtor
is found. and the sheriff can execute it only within that county; in exe-
cuting the warrant the sheriff shall deliver to the debtor a copy thereof,
and of the testimony on which it issued; the debtor. when brought before
the judge, shall be examined on oath, and other witnesses may be
examined on either side: if it appear in the examination that there is
danger of the debtor leaving the state, or that he has property which he
unjustly refuses to apply to the judgment, he may be ordered to enter
into an undertaking. with surety, in such sum as the judge may pre-
scribe, that he will attend before the judge or referee for examination,
from time to time, as shall be directed; and in default of entering into
such undertaking. he may be committed to the jail of the county, by 
warrant of the judge, as for contempt. 
Sec. 5475. After the return of an execution against the property 
of a judgment debtor, or of one of several debtors in the same judg-
ment, and upon proof, in writing, by affidavit, or otherwise, to the satis-
faction of the judge, that a person or corporation has property of such
judgment debtor. or is indebted to him, the judge may, by an order, 
require such person or corporation. or any officer or member of the cor-
poration, to appear at a specified time and place, within the county in
which such person or corporation is served with the order, and answer
concerning the same: the service of the order shall bind the property in
the possession or under the control of such person or corporation from 
the time of service ; and the person or corporation so served with the
order shall be liable to the judgment creditor for all property, money,
and credits in his hands belonging to the judgment debtor, or due to
him from such person or corporation, from the time of service; but if,
on the filing of the affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or attor-
ney, the judge is satisfied of the existence of any of the grounds upon 
which an order of attachment may be issued, as provided in section 
fifty-five Aundred and lwenl)'-()M, the order may be issued before the
issue and return of execution; and the judge may also require notice
of such proceeding to be given to any party in the action, in such
manner as may seem to him proper.
SEC. 5476. No person shall, on examination pursuant to this subdivision, be excused from answering any question on the ground that
his examination will tend to convict him of a fraud; but his answer
shall not be used as evidence against him in a prosecution for such 
fraud.

the referee, and certified to the judge; all examinations and answers
before a judge or referee must be on oath; and when a corporation
answers, the answer must be on the oath of an officer thereof.
SEc. 5481. If a person, party, or witness disobey an order of the
judge or referee, duly served, he may be punished as for contempt; 
and such judge or referee may enforce order, and punish for contempt,
in like manner as justices of the peace. 
SEc. 5482. After the issue of execution against property, a person
indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount of
his debt, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execu­
tion; and the sheriffs receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the
amount so paid, or directed to be credited by the judgment creditor on 
the execution. 
SEc. 5483. The judge may order any property of the judgment
debtor, or money due to him, not exempt by law, in the hands either
of himself or other person, or of a corporation, to be applied toward
the satisfaction of the judgment; but the earnings of the debtor for his
personal services, at any time within three months next preceding the
order, can not be so applied, when it is made to appear, by the affidavit 
of the debtor, or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the
use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor. 
SEC. 5484. The judge may, by order, appoint the sheriff of the
proper county, or other suitable person, a receiver of the property of 
the judgment debtor; and he may also, by order, forbid a transfer, or
other disposition of, or any interference with, the property of the judg- 
ment debtor not exempt by law. 
SEC. 5485. If the sheriff be appointed receiver, he and his sure-
ties shall be liable on his official bond as such receiver; and if another
person be appointed, he shall take an oath and give an undertaking as 
in other cases. 
SEC. 5486. 1f it appear that the judgment debtor has an interest
in real estate, in the courit>: in which. p~oceedings are had, a~ mort- 
gagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, and his interest can be ascertained as
between himself and the person holding the legal estate, or the person 
having a lien on or interest in the same, without controversy as to the
interest of such person holding such legal estate, or interest therein, or
lien on the same, the receiver may be ordered to sell and convey such
real estate, or the interest of the debtor therein; such sale shall be con-
ducted, in all respects, in the same manner as is provided for the sale
of real estate upon execution; and the proceedings of sale shall, before
the execution of the deed, be approved by the court in which the judg- 
ment was rendered, or the transcript filed. 
SEC. 5487. The order mentioned in sectionsfi/lJfour /1urulred and
setenty-ttoo, jifl)four.hurul:~d and sn1e1_1ty_-ll1rte, and j/lJft1ur h11ndrtd and 
saxtuy-fit», shall be in wntmg, and signed by the Judge who makes the
same. and shall be served as a summons; and the judge shall reduce
all his orders to writing, which, together with a minute of his proceed-
ings, signed by himself, shall be filed with the clerk of the court of the
county in which the judgment is rendered, or the transcript of the jus-
tice is filed, and the clerk shall enter on his execution docket the time 
of filing the same. 
SEC. 5488. The probate judge shall be allowed for his services
under this subdivision the sum of three dollars in each case, and such 
fees as are allowed by law to clerks of the court of common pleas for 
similar services. 
SEC. 5489. The judge shall allow to clerks, sheriffs, referees,
receivers, and witnesses, such compensation as is allowed for like serv- 
ices in other cases, to be taxed as costs in the case, and shall enforce

pay the same.

a copy of the rule, shall be made on the defendant a reasonable time 
before the order of attachment is made.

SEC. 6641. In cases under the last section: a charge in writing
shall be filed with the clerk, an entry thereof made upon the journal, 
and an opportunity given to the accused to be heard, by himself or

dred a11d forryl, if the writ is not returnable forthwith, the court may fix

the day named, the court may issue another order of arrest, or may order
the undertaking for his appearance to be prosecuted, or both; and if

and the costs of the proceeding, and such recovery shall be for the ben-
efit of the party injured.

corporation, specifying the names of the stockholders, their residence,
when known, the number of shares belonging to each, the amount paid

3. A statement of all the incumbrances on the property of the cor­
poration, and of all engagements entered into by it which have not been
fully satisfied or canceled, specifying the place of residence of each
creditor, and of every person to whom such engagements were made, if
known, and if not known, the fact to be so stated, and the sum owing 
to each creditor, the nature of each debt or demand, and the true cause
and consideration of such indebtedness. 
SEC. 5653. To every such petition there shall also be annexed an
affidavit of the applicants, that the facts stated in the application, and 
the accounts, inventories, and statements contained therein or annexed
thereto, are just and true, so far as they know, or have the means of 
knowing. ·
SEc. 5654. Upon such petition, accounts, inventories, and affida-
vit being filed, an order shall be entered requiring all persons inter-
ested in the corporation to show cause, if any they have, why it should
not be dissolved, before some referee or master commissioner appointed
by the court, and to be named in the order, at a time and place therein
to be specified, not less than three months from the date thereof; and
a notice of the contents of such order shall be published once in each
week, for three weeks successively, in some newspaper published and
of general circulation in the county wherein the principal place of 
business of the corporation is situate. 
SEC. 5655. On the day appointed in the order, the referee or mas-
ter shall proceed to hear the allegations and proofs of such parties, take 
testimony in relation thereto, and, with all convenient speed, report the
same to the court, with a statement of the property, effects, debts,
credits, and engagements of the corporation, and of all other matters
and things pertaining to its affairs. 
SEC. 5656. When the report is made, if it appear to the court
that the corporation is insolvent or that a dissolution thereof will be 
ene icia to t e stoc o ers, an not mjunous to t e pu re interest,
or that the objects of the corporation have wholly failed, or been
entirely abandoned, or that it is impracticable to accomplish such
objects, a judgment shall be entered dissolving the corporation, and
appointing one or more receivers of its estate and effects; and the cor-
poration shall thereupon be dissolved, and shall cease. 

SEC. 5657. A director, trustee, or other officer of the corporation,
or any of its stockholders, may be appointed a receiver; and a receiver 
shall, before entering upon the duties of his appointment, give such
security to the state, and in such penalty, as the court shall direct, con-
ditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties of his appointment, 
and for the due accounting for all money received by him.
SEC. 5658. Such receiver shall be vested with all the estate, real
or personal, of the corporation, from the time of his having filed the 
security hereinbefore required, and shall be trustee of such estate for
the benefit of the creditors of the corporation and its stockholders; and

to whom assignments are made for the benefit of creditors. 
SEC. 5659. If there be any sum remaining due upon any share of
stock subscribed in the corporation, the receiver shall immediately pro-
ceed and recover the same, unless the person so indebted is wholly
insolvent, and for that purpose may commence and prosecute an action
for the recovery of such sum, without the consent of any creditor of 
the corporation.
SEC. 5660. The receiver shall, immediately on his appointmen., ·
give notice thereof, which shall contain the same matters required by
law in notices of trustees of insolvent debtors, and in addition thereto
it shall notify all persons holding any open or subsisting contract of the
corporation to present the same to him, in writing and in detail, a~ the 
time and place in such notice specified, which shall be published for

is situate.

veyances, of any part of the estate, real or personal, mcluding things

tion of the corporation is filed, in payment of or as security for any
existing or prior debt, or for any other consideration, and all judgments
confessed by such corporation after that time, shall be absolutely void 
as a~ainst the receiver appointed on such petition, and as against the
creditors of the corporation. 
SEC. 5662. After the first publication of the notice of the appoint·
ment of a receiver, every person having possession of any property 
belonging to the corporation, and every person indebted thereto, shall
account and answer to the receiver for the amount of such debt, and
for the value of such property; and all the provisions of law in respect
to trustees of insolvent debtors, the collection and preservation of the
property of such debtors, the concealment and discovery thereof, and

receiver, and to the property of the corporation, except as otherwise 
provided herein. 
SEc. 5663. The receiver shall call a general meeting of the cred­ 
itors of the corporation, within four months from the time of his appoint­
ment, at which all accounts and demands for and against the corpora­
tion, and all its open and subsisting contracts, shall be ascertained and
adjusted, as fully as may be, and the amount of money in the hands of
the receiver declared; and he may settle controversies that arise between
him and the debtors or creditors of the corporation by arbitrament or 
reference. 
SEC. 5664. If there be any open and subsisting engagements on
contracts of the corporation which are in the nature of insurance, or 
contingent engagements of any kind, the receiver may, with the consent
of the party holding such engagements, cancel and discharge the same,
by refunding to such party the premium orconsideration paid thereon by
the corporation, or so much thereof as shall be in the same proportion 
to the time which remains of any risk assumed by such engagements, 
as the whole premium bears to the whole term of such risk; and upon
such amount being paid by the receiver to the person holding or being
the legal owner of such engagement, it shall be deemed canceled and
discharged as against the receiver. 
SEC. 5665. The receiver shall, in addition to his actual disburse­
ments, be entitled to such commissions as the court shall allow, not
exceeding the sum allowed to executors or administrators, as well as
reasonable counsel fees for services rendered him.

hands a sufficient amount to pay the sums which he is hereinbefore 
authorized to pay, for the purpose of canceling and discharging any
open or subsisting engagements; and if any suit be pending against 
the corporation or the receiver, for any demand, he may retain the pro­
portion which would belong to such demand if established, and the
necessary costs of the proceedings, to be applied according to the event
of such suit, or to be distributed in a second or other dividend. 
SEC. 5667. The receiver shall distribute the residue of the
money in his hands in the payment of obligations of the corporation 
which have been exhibited by creditors, and ascertained, in the follow­
ing order: 
1. Debts entitled to a preference under the laws of the United
States. 
2. Mortgages, judgments, and other liens on the real estate of the
corporation, in the order of their priority. 
3. Debts which are liens upon the capital stock or property of the
corporation, other than real estate, in the order of their priority, and
the extent of the value of the stock or other property on which they 
are liens.
SEC. 6688. The receiver may, from time to time, make dividends
of the money in his hands, among the creditors of the corporation, 
until they are paid in full; but no dividend shall be made to the stock·
holders of the corporation until after the final dividend to creditors;
and if, after such final dividend is made, there remain any surplus in
the hands of the receiver, he shall distribute the same among the stock-
holders of the corporation, in proportion to the respective amounts
paid in by them severally on their shares of stock. 

SEC. 6669. The receiver shall be subject to the direction and con-
trol of the court as to the time of making dividends, both to the cred- 
itors and stockholders of the corporation, and as to the time of closing
up the concerns of the corporation, and rendering his final accounts,
and may be compelled to account at any time; and he may be removed
by the court, and any vacancy created by such removal, or by death, 
or oth'erwise, may be filled by the court.
SEC. 6670. When required by the court, the receiver shall render 
a full and accurate account of all his proceedings to the court, on oath,
which may be referred to a referee or master.commissioner to examine 
and report thereon; but before he renders any such account he shall
insert a notice of his intention to present the same, once a week, for
three consecutive weeks, in some newspaper printed and of general
circulation in the county wherein the principal place of business of the
corporation is situate, specifying the time and place at which such
account will be rendered.
SEC. 5671. The referee to whom such account is referred shall
hear and examine the proofs, vouchers, and documents offered for or 
against the same, and shall report thereon fully to the court; and when
the report is made, the court shall hear the allegations of all concerned
therein, and shall allow or disallow the account, and may decree the
same to be final and conclusive upon all the creditors of the corpora-
tion, upon all persons who have claims against it, upon any open or
subsisting engagement, and upon all the stockholders of the corpora- 
tion. 
SEC. 6672. The receiver shall also account, from time to time, in
the same manner, and with like effect, for all money which comes to 
his hands after such account is rendered, and for all money retained by

stock of the corporation, over and above the salaries and expenses 
authorized by the by-laws and regulations of the corporation, and that

make an order requiring the officers of the corporation, within a rea­
sonable time, to file in court the inventories, accounts, and statements
required by section fifty-six hundred and fiflJ-hvo; upon the filing

and fifty-four, requiring all persons interested in the corporation to show
cause, if any they have, why such corporation should not be dissolved,

reasonable.

she had before such marriage; she shall be allowed such alimony out

ments; and the effect of such judgment shall be to restore to the wife
all her lands, tenements, and hereditarnents not previously disposed of,
and to vest in her the right and power to acquire, hold, manage, and
dispose of property, money, and choses in action, and to bring and

entitled in her own right, or any part thereof, or is proceeding, or about
to proceed, fraudulently to convert the same, or any part thereof, to his
own use, for the purpose of placing the same beyond her reach, and
depriving her of the benefit thereof, and the court may enjoin the hus­
band from disposing of, or otherwise interfering with, such property,
money, credits, or choses in action, and may appoint a receiver to
manage and control the same for the benefit of the wife, and may also
make such other order in the premises as it deems just and proper;
upon the tiling of the petition, a provisional injunction may be allowed
as in other cases, with or without bond, at discretion: and such peti- 
tion shall be filed in the' county where the petitioner resides, and the

accepted by the widow, shall be a good assignment in law. 

SEc. 5708. A widow may file her petition for dower in the court
of common pleas or superior court, against the heir, or other person
having the next immediate estate of inheritance, or any other estate or
interest therein, setting forth the right thereto, and describing the tracts

DOWER. 
SEC. 5711. When the plaintiff dies before the assignment of her
dower, or before entry of the final judgment, the action may be revived
in the name of her executor or administrator; the court shall proceed
to hear and determine, if not before decided, whether the plaintiff
would have been entitled to dower in such action if she had lived ; if
it be found that she would have been so entitled, the court shall adjudge
in favor of such executor or administrator a sum equal to one-third of
the rental value of the real estate in which it is found the plaintiff
would have been entitled to dower, from the time of filing the petition
until her death, after deducting one-third of the necessary expenses;
and the sum so adjudged in favor of such executor or administrator
shall be a lien upon the real estate in which such plaintiff would have
been entitled to dower, and its payment may be enforced by sale as
upon execution. 
SEc. 5712. When dower is adjudged, the court shall appoint three
judicious, disinterested men of the county in which the action is pend­
ing, who are not of kin to either of the parties interested, to Le com­
missioners, and issue its order to the sheriff of that county, command­
ing him that, by the oaths of the commissioners, which may be admin­
istered by him, he cause to be set off and assigned such dower to the 
plaintiff, in the manner set forth in the judgment. 

SEC. 5713. The commissioners and sheriff shall in all things obey
the order, and return their proceedings thereon to the court at such
time as the court appoints; if the court approve the assignment, it
shall he entered on the records thereof, and shall be · thenceforth valid
and effective in law; and execution shall thereupon be issued, directing
the sheriff of the county to put the widow in full possession of the 
dower assigned to her. 
SEC. 5714. When an estate of which a woman is dowable is entire,
and no division thereof can be made by metes and bounds, dower
shall be assigned as of a third part of the rents, issues, and profits
thereof, to be computed and ascertained by the commissioners. 
SEC. 5715. The commissioners shall, after they have set off and 
assigned <lower, make a just and true appraisement of the yearly value,
after deducting necessary expenses. of the real estate in which the widow
is entitled to dower, estimating such value from the day of filing the peti­
tion to the day of assignment of dower, and make return of such
appraisernent and assignment, and the court shall adjudge the payment
of one-third of the whole sum so returned, to the widow, out of the
real estate not covered by her dower, upon which judgment execution
may issue; but nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to
require execution to be issued against such of the defendants in dower
as are minors; but in all such cases the dower shall operate as a lien
upon the real estate, for their proportion of the judgment, until the 
same is folly paid. 
SEC. 5716. The commissioners, in making the appraisernent of the
yearly value of the real estate provided for in the last section, shall 
exclude all permanent or valuable improvements made thereon after the
husband of such widow ceased to be the owner thereof.
SEc. 5717. If, during the minority of an heir, dower be assigned to
a widow not en.titled thereto, or. if she recov.er the same by t.he default, 
fraud, or collusion of the guardian, such heir may, on com mg of age,
have an action against such widow to recover the lands wrongfully 
awarded.
SEc. 5718. If resistance be made to the petition of a widow claim-
ing dower, and the court find that she is entitled to dower as claimed
in the petition, the defendant so resisting shall be required to pay all
costs of suit; but if no resistance be made, the widow shall pay
one-third of the costs, and the legal owner of the real estate shall pay 
two-thirds thereof. 
SEc. 5719. In actions for partition, when the estate can not be

estate by executors, administrators, and guardians, the widow of any 
decedent who has a dower interest therein, being a party, may file her
answer, and waive the assignment of dower by metes and bounds, and
ask the court to have the estate sold free of dower, and to allow her in
lieu thereof such sum of money, out of the proceeds of the sale, as the
court deems the just and reasonable value of her dower interest therein. 

SEc. 5720. The answer of the widow shall have the same force
and effect, and shall be taken and held to be, in all respects, as a deed 
of release to the purchaser of such estate of the dower interest therein
of such widow. 
SEc. 5721. The guardian ot a widow who has been adjudged
insane may appear and answer for her in such action, subject to the
approval of the court in which the action is pending; and the answer
of the guardian. shall have the same force and effect as if the widow
answered personally; but the guardian shall be liable to the widow, or
her heirs, for all damage or loss sustained by his fraud or collusion, not-
withstanding the approval of the court. 
SEC. 5722. A person owning real estate in this state, incumbered
by the contingent or vested right of dower of an insane woman, may 
apply, by petition, to the court of comon pleas of the county in which
the real estate, or any part thereof, is situate, making defendants thereto
such insane woman, and also her husband and guardian, if she has
either or both, for leave to sell all or any part thereof, discharged and
unincumbered of such contingent or vested right, which petition shall
set forth the insanity of the woman, together with a description of the
land proposed to be sold; the court shall thereupon appoint a committee
of six competent men, of whom at least three are physicians, who shall,
under oath, inquire into the fact of the insanity of such woman, and
shall hear testimony to be produced by her husband or guardian, or,
if there is no such guardian, by her guardian ad litem, to he appointed
by the court in the action; and the committee shall, at any term of such
court, make a report in writing of the result of their investigation, 
signed by all the members thereof (35 v. 105, ~ 1; 60 v. 24, S I.] 
SEC. 5723. If the committee report unanimously that such woman
is, in their opinion, permanently insane, the court shall appoint three
judicious freeholders to appraise the real estate mentioned in the petition,
whether the same is in one or several counties, who shall report in writ- 
ing the value of each tract. 
SEc. 5724. Upon the filing of such report the court may direct
such petitioner to convey, by good and sufficient deed of conveyance, 
to the insane woman, to be by her held in fee, such proportion of the 
real estate set forth in the petition as shall to the court seem just and
proper, or the court may assign to such insane woman. to lie by -her
held during life, after the death of her husband, if she has a husband,
such proportion of the real estate set forth in the petition as shall to the
court seem just and proper, for her support, or the court may order the
petitioner to invest an amount, to be hy it fixed, in the stock of a corn­ 
pany, or stocks created by the laws of this state. as by the court may
be designated, the profits and dividends arising from such investment
to be applied to the support and maintenance of the insane woman after
the death of her husband, if she has a husband; and the petitioner
may. upon his compliance with the order of the court, sell all the real
property he is possessed of, described in his petition, free and unim­
cumbered of the contingent or vested right of dower of such. insane 
woman. 
SEC. 5725. When the husband of an insane woman conveys any
real estate in this state owned by him, in which such insane woman has
a contingent or vested right of dower, by virtue of such ownership of
her husband, or otherwise, and she does not join her husband in such
conveyance, he may apply by petition to the court of common pleas
of the county in which she resides, or, if she resides out of the state,
then in which the real estate is situate, for leave to have any part or all
of such real estate so conveyed released and disincumbered of her
dower right therein, which petition shall set forth the insanity of the
wife, and a description of the land proposed to be affected: to which
petition the insane wife, her guardian, if she has one, and all persons
in interest, shall be made defendants, and the petition shall be pro-
ceeded in, in all respects, in the manner prescribed in the three preced­
ing sections, except that instead of ordering the petitioner to sell the
real estate, or to convey or assign to such insane woman any part
thereof, the court shall direct the petitioner to make such investment
as in said sections provided, or may require the petitioner to secure the
amount to the use of the insane woman by the mortgage to her of unin­
cumbered real estate of at least double the value thereof; and upon
compliance by the petitioner with the order of the court, the court shall
enter a judgment releasing and discharging the real estate from the
incumbrance of such contingent or vested right of dower, and shall
adjudge the holder of the legal title, or other party liable, to pay to the
petitioner any sum withheld or retained as indemnity against such
dower right.

SEC. 5756. A person entitled to partition of an estate may file his
petition therefor in the court of common pleas, setting forth the nature
of his title, and a pertinent description of the lands, tenements, or
hereditarnents of which partition is demanded, and naming each tenant 
in common, coparcener, or other interested person, as defendants
therein.
SEc. 5157. If the court find that the plaintiff has a legal right to
any part of such estate, it shall order partition thereof in favor of the
plaintiff, or all parties in interest, appoint three disinterested and judi­
cious freeholders of the vicinity to he commissioners to make the par­
tition, and order a writ of partition to issue. 

SEC. 6768. The writ of partition may be directed to the sheriff of
either of the counties in which any part of the· estate lies, and shall 
command him that, by the oaths of the commissioners, which oath may 
be administered by him, he cause to be set off and divided to the
plaintiff, or each party in interest, such part and proportion of the estate
as the court shall order.
SEC. 5769. In making such partition the commissioners mus: view
and examine the estate, and, on their oaths, set apart the same in such
lots as will be most advantageous and equitable, having due regard tc
the improvements, situation, and quality of the different parts thereof. 

SEc. 6760. When partition of more than one tract is demanded,
the commissioners shall set off to each plaintiff or, party in interest his
proper proportion in each of the several tracts, unless the several tracts
are owned by the same proprietors in the same proportion in each tract,
in which case the whole share of any proprietor, in all the several
tracts, may be set off to such proprietor according to the best discretion 
of the commissioners.
SEC. 6761. Before a writ of partition is issued, the person of whom
partition is demanded may appear in court, in person or by attorney,
and consent to a partition of the estate, agreeably to the prayer and
facts set forth in the petition, which amicable partition, when made and
recorded, shaJl be valid and binding between the parties thereto. 

SEC. 5762. When the commissioners are of opinion that the estate
can not be divided according to the demand of the writ withc:u mani­
fest injury to the value thereof, they shall return that fact to the court,
with a just valuation of the estate; whereupon, if the court approve of
the return, and one or more of the parties elect to take the estate at
such appraised value, the same shall be adjudged to him or them, upon
his or their paying to the other parties their proportion of the appraised 
-~ 
value thereof, according to their respective rights, or securing the same
as hereinafter provided. 
SEC. 5763. If one or· more of the parties elect to take the estate 
at t e appraise va ue, t e erms o payment, un ess e court, on g
cause shown, by special order, direct and require the entire payment to 
be made in cash, or unless all the parties in interest agree thereon, shall
be one-third cash, one-third in one year, and one-third in two years,
with interest, the deferred payments to be secured to the satisfaction of 
the court; and on payment being made in full, or in part, with sufficient
security for the remainder, as above provided, the sheriff shall, accord-
ing to the order of the court, make and execute a conveyance to the 
party electing to take the same.
SEC. 5764. If no such election to take the estate be made, the
court may, at the instance of a party, make an order for the sale thereof 
at public auction, by the sheriff who executed the writ of partition, or
his successor in office. 
SEC. 6765. All such sales shall be made at the door of the court-
house, unless the court, for good cause, direct the same to be made on 
the premises, and shall be conducted in all other respects as a sale upon
execution, except that it shall not be necessary to appraise the estate;
but the estate shall not be sold for less than two-thirds of the appraised
value thereof, as returned by the commissioners; and unless the court,
by special order, direct and require, on good cause shown, the entire
payment to be made in cash, the purchase money shall be payable one-
third on the day of sale, one-third in one year, and one-third in two
years thereafter, with interest.
SEC. 5766. On the return Dy the sheriff of his proceedings, the
court shall examine the same,· if sale has been made, and the court 
approve such sale, the sheriff, on receiving payment of the considera-
tion money, or taking sufficient security therefor, to the satisfaction of
the court, shall execute and deliver a deed to the purchaser. 

SEC. 5767. The money or securities arising from a sale 'of or an
election to take the estate, shall be distributed and paid, by order of
the court, to the parties entitled thereto, in lieu of their respective parts
and proportions of the estate, according to their just rights therein;
and all receipts of such money or securities by the sheriff shall be in 
his official capacity, and his sureties on his official bond shall be liable
for any misapplication thereof. 
6768. When the estate has been once offered and not sold,
an alias writ for the sale thereof may issue as often as need be; and the
court may order a revaluation, by three judicious and disinterested free- 
holders of the vicinity, to be appointed by the court, and direct a sale
of the estate at not less than two-thirds of such revaluation, or, if the
court deem it for the interest of the parties, it may order a sale without
such revaluation, at not less than such sum as it may fix. 

SEC. 6760. When a conveyance of land sold, or elected to be
taken, is not made by the officer who made the sale, the court, being 
first satisfied that such sale or election was regularly made, and that the
purchase money has been fully paid or secured, may, on motion, order
the sheriff of the county, or officer performing the duties of sheriff, to
execute and deliver to the purchaser, or person electing to take the
property, a deed for the lands so sold or elected to be taken. 

SEC. 5770. When a widow is entitled to dower in an estate of
~vhich partiti?n is sought, dower must be assigned her therein, except 
in the follow mg cases : 
1. When an assignment thereof has already been made.
2. When she has, by answer, elected to be endowed out of the pro­ 
ceeds of a sale of the estate, and the commissioners do not make par­
tition, but return a valuation of the estate. 
3. When the right of dower extends only to an undivided interest
in the estate. 
In the latter case, and in cases where an undivided interest is subject
to a life estate, and the tenant for life has not, by answer, elected to
receive the value of his estate out of the proceeds of a sale of the
interest, the commissioners may, if an appraisement of the estate is to
be returned, assign the dower, or set off the life estate, or, if they find
it for the interest of the parties so to do, they may appraise the whole
interest, and the widow and the tenant for life shall receive the value
of their interests out of the proceeds of a sale thereof. 

SEC. 6771. The commissioners appointed by the court to make
partition shall set off to such widow her dower in the estate· and in the 

performance of such duty they shall be governed in all respects by, and
the proceedings shall conform to, the provisions prescribing the duties
of commissioners in assigning dower, in chapter seven of this division. 

SEC. 5772. The guardian of a minor, idiot, or insane person, may,
on behalf of his ward, do and perform any act, matter, or thing 
respecting the partition of an estate which such minor, idiot, or insane
person could do under this chapter if he were of age and of sound
mind; and he may elect, on behalf of such ward, to take the estate, 
when the same can not be divided without injury, and make payments
therefor on behalf of such ward. 
SEC. 5773. A person appointed according to the laws of any other
state or country, to take charge of the estate of an idiot or insane person 
not a resident of this state, may, upon being duly authorized in this
state to take charge of such estate situated in this state, act in the par-
tition of such estate to the same extent that the guardian of an idiot or
insane person is authorized to do by the last section. 
SEC. 5774. One tenant in common, or copa.rcener, may recover
from another his share of rents and profits received by such tenant in
common or coparcener from the estate, according to the justice and 
equity of the case; and one parcener may maintain an action of waste
against another; but no parcener shall have or possess any privileges
over another, in any election, division, partition, or matter, to be made
or done, concerning lands which have descended, 
SEc. 577 6. When two or more religious denominations, or other 
societies or associations, have united in a corporation, and as such cor-
poration acquire title to real estate in this state, and subsequently agree 
to separate and form two or more separate corporations under the laws
of the state, either corporation, after such separate organization, may 
file its petition, under this charter, for partition of such property so 
required and held.
SEC. 6776. When two or more religious societies or congregations
have, by gift or purchase, acquired land upon which to erect a house of
public worship, and other buildings for church or school purposes, and 
for a cemetery, in common, and either of such societies or congre~a-
tions desires to abandon the joint use of such house of public worship,
or other erections, it may commence an action for the partition of the
use of such common property, except the cemetery, which may con-
tinue to be used in common.
SEC. 6777. If the court find that partition, in cases mentioned in 
t e ast section, can e ma e ID SU manner as to occasion no con U- 
sion or inconvenience to either party in the separate use of the common
property, it may order partition thereof to be made; it shall specify in
the judgment for what purpose partition of the use is made, and how
and for what purpose the use of the premises alloted to each party shall 
be occupied; and in no case shall the same or any part thereof be 
occupied for any other purpose than the erection of a house of worship,
and other erections connected therewith. ls6 v, 67, §§ 2, 3, 4.] 
SEC. 6778. The court, having regard to the interest of the parties,
and the benefit each may derive from a partition, and according to 
equity, shall tax the costs and expenses which accrue in the action,
including reasonable counsel fees, which shall be paid to plaintiff's
counsel, unless the court award some part thereof to other counsel for
service in the case for the common benefit of all the parties ; and exe- 
cution may issue therefor as in other cases. (29 v. 254, § 16.]

SEC. 5779. An action may be brought by a person in possession,
by himself or tenant, of real property, against any person who claims
an estate, or interest therein, adverse to him, for the purpose of deter­ 
mining such adverse estate or interest. (67 v. 116, ~ 557.] 
SEC. 5780. In actions for the recovery of purchase money of real
estate, by vendor against vendee, it shall be competent for such vendee, 
notwithstanding his continued possession, to set up, by way of counter-
claim, any breach of the covenants of title acquired by him from the 
plaintiff, and to make any person claiming an adverse estate or interest
therein party to the action ; and upon the hearing he shall be entitled
to recoup, against the plaintiff's demand, the present worth of any
existing lien or incumbrance thereon; and if the adverse estate or
interest of the claimant is an estate in reversion or remainder, or con-
tingent upon a future event, the court may order the vendee, with his
assent, to surrender the possession to his vendor, upon the repayment
of so much of the purchase money as has been paid thereon, with
interest, or direct the payment of the purchase money claimed in the
action, upon the plaintiff giving bond in double the amount thereof,
with two or more sureties, to be approved by the court, for the pay-
ment of the same, with interest, if the defendant or his privies be sub-
sequently evicted by reason of the defect. ( 67 v. 116, § 557.] 
SEC. 5781. In an action for the recovery of real property, it shall
be sufficient if the plaintiff state in his petition that he has a legal estate 
therein, and is entitled to the possession thereof, describing the same
as required by sectionfa,e IMusand and ninety-five, and that the defend- 
-ant unlawfully keeps him out of the possession; and it shall not be
necessary to state how the plaintiff's estate or ownership is derived. 

SEC. 5782. 1t shall be sufficient, in such action, if the defendant
in his answer deny, generally, the title alleged in the petition, or that 
he withholds the possession; but if he deny the title of the plaintiff,
possession by the defendant shall be taken as admitted; and when he
does not defend for the whole premises, the answer shall describe the 
particular part for which defense is made.
SEC. 5783. In an action by a tenant in common of rea1 property 
against a co-tenant, the plaintiff must state, in addition to what is
required in sectionfifty-srom hundred and dghty-one, that the defendant 
either denied the plaintiff's right, or did some act amounting to such
denial.
SEC. 5784. In an action for the recovery of real property, when
the plaintiff shows a right to recover at the time the action was com- 
mence , out rs rig t as terminate urmg t e pen ency o t e acuon, 
the verdict and judgment must be according to the fact, and the plain-
tiff may recover for withholding the property. 
SEC. 5785. Parties in an action for the recovery of real property
may avail themselves, if entitled thereto, of the benefit of the statutes 
for the re e of occupymg c aimants.

his heirs, are fully paid the value of all lasting and valuable improve­
ments made on the land by him, or by the person under whom he holds,
previous to receiving actual notice by the commencement of suit on
such adverse claim, whereby such eviction may be effected, unless such
occupying claimant refuse to pay to the person so setting up and prov­
ing an adverse and better title the value of the land, without improve­
ments made thereon as aforesaid, upon demand of the successful

1. Such occupying claimant holds a plain and connected title, in law
or equity, derived from the records of a public office; or,

~ainst the occupying claimant, in all cases of lands sold for taxes by
virtue of any law of this state, or the laws of the territory north-west of
the river Ohio, shall be considered an adverse and better title, under
the provisions of the last section, whether it be the title under which the
taxes were due, and for which the land was sold, or any other title or
claim; and the occupying claimant holding possession of land so sold
for taxes, having the deed of a collector of taxes or county auditor
therefor, or a certificate of such sale from a collector of taxes or a

ant has received after having received notice of the plaintiff's title by
the service of a summons, and deduct the amount thereof from the

successful claimant, or his heirs, or, if they are minors, their guardians,
may either demand of the occupying claimant the value of the land

court shall allow.

the same; the men so employed shall be under the direction of the
person having such charge; the commissioner, and all others who, at

preserving the vessel or cargo, shall be paid a reasonable compensa­
tion for their labor and trouble, and iu. default thereof the vessel or

compensation, the person having the lawful charge of the vessel or 
cargo, and the commissioner, may each choose one indifferent person,
who is a freeholder, to ascertain and adjust the compensation; if they
cannot agree, they shall appoint another like person to assist them in the
adjustment; and the decision of such persons, or any two of them,

ment shall not prejudice the rights or interests of the owner of the vessel
or cargo on the appeal; if the sum awarded by the freeholders be less­

court may order the testimony of such witnesses to be taken and reduced
to writing by some competent person, which testimony shall be filed in 
such probate court. 
SEC. 5947. If the court, upon such proof, shall be satisfied that
such last will And testament was duly executed in the mode provided by
the law in force at the time of its execution, that the contents thereof
are substantially proved, and that the same was unrevoked at the death
of the testator, and has been lost, spoliated, or destroyed subsequent to
the death of such testator, or his Lemming incapable, as aforesaid,
such court shall find and establish the contents of such will as near as
the same can be ascertained, and cause the same and the testimony

the proceedings or extend the time for contesting the validity of any 
will, or for asserting any rights thereunder, and the record provided for

destroyed, and the time as near as may be, when the will was originally
admitted to probate and record. 
SEc. 5962. It is hereby made the duty oi every probate judge,

his direction; or by some other will or codicil, in writing, executed as
prescribed by this title; or by some other writing, signed, attested, and
subscribed, in the manner provided by this title for the making of a 
will, but nothing herein contained shall prevent the revocation implied
by law, from subsequent changes in the condition or circumstances of 
the testator. 
SEC. 5954. A bond, agreement, or covenant, made for a valuable
consideration by a testator, to convey any property devised or 
bequeathed in any will previously made, shall not be deemed a revoca­
tion of such previous devise or bequest, either at law or in equity; but
such property shall pass by such devise or bequest, subject to the same
remedies on such bond, agreement, or covenant, for a specific perform­
ance or otherwise, against the devisees or legatees, as might be had by
law against the heirs of the testator, or his next of kin, if the same had 
descended to them. 
SEC. 5955. A charge or incumbrance upon any real or personal
estate, for the purpose of securing the payment of money, or the per­
formance of any covenant, shall not be deemed a revocation of any 
will relating to the same estate, previously executed; but the devises
and legacies therein contained shall pass and take effect, subject to such 
charge or incumbrance. 
SEc. 5956. A conveyance, settlement, deed, or other act of the 
testator, by which his estate or interest in property previously devised or
bequeathed by him, shall be altered, but not wholly divested, shall not
be deemed a revocation of the devise or bequest of such property, but
such devise or bequest shall pass to the devisee or legatee, the actual
estate or interest of the testator, which would otherwise descend to his
heirs, or pass to his next of kin; unless, in the instrument by which
such alteration is made, the intention is declared, that it shall operate as 
a revocation of such previous devise or bequest. 
SEC. 5957. But if the provisions of the instrument by which such 
alteration is made, are wholly inconsistent with the terms and nature of
such previous devise or bequest, such instrument shall operate as a
revocation thereof, unless such provisions depend on a condition or
contingency, and such condition be not performed, or such contingency 
do not happen. 
SEC. 5958. A will executed by an unmarried woman, shall not
be deemed revoked by her subsequent marriage. 
SEC. 5959. If the testator had no children at the time of executing

death, such will shall be deemed revoked, unless provisions shall have
been made for such child by some settlement, or unless such child shall 
have been provided for in the will, or in such way mentioned therein
as to show an intention not to make such provision, and no other evi­
dence to rebut the presumption or revocation shall be received.
SEC. 5960. If, after the making of a will, the testator shall duly
make and execute a second will, the destruction, canceling, or revoca-
tion of such second will shall not revive the first will, unless it appear

give effect to his first will; or unless, after such destruction, canceling,
or revocation, he shall duly republish his first will. 
SEC. 5961. When a testator, at the time of executing his will, shal
have a child absent and reported to be dead, or having a child at the 
time of executing the will, shall afterward have a child who is not pro-
vided for in the will, the absent child, or the child born after the exe-
cution of the will, shall take the same share of the estate, both real and
personal, that he would have been entitled to if the testator had died
intestate; toward raising which portion the devisees and legatees shall
equally contribute, in proportion to the value of what they shall respect-
ively receive under the will, unless, in consequence of a specific devise
or bequest, or of some other provisions in the will, a different appor-
tionment among the devisees and legatees shall be found necessary, in
order to give effect to the intention of the testator, as to that part of
the estate which shall pass by the will: provided, that if such child,
supposed to be dead at the time of the execution of the will, shall have
a child or children, provision for whom is made by the testator, the
other legatees and devisees shall not be required to contribute, but such
child, supposed to have been dead, shall take the provision made for
his child or children, by the testator, or such part thereof as the cir-
cumstances of the case, in the opinion of the court of proper jurisdic- 
tion, may think just and equitable.
SEC. 5962. In settling the extent of the claim of any child, as
provided for. in the precedin~ section, any portion of the estate of the

the probate of such will, to issue a citation to said widow to appear and
make her election, whether she will take such provision, or be endowed 
of the lands of her said husband and take her distributive share of his
personal estate; and said election shall be made within one year from 
the date of the service of the citation aforesaid ; but she shall not be
entitled to both. unless it plainly appears by the will to have been the
intention that she should have such provision in addition to her dower 
and distributive share. 
SEC. 5964. The election of the widow to take under the will, shall

provisions of the will, her rights under it, and by law in the event of
her refusal to take under the will. The election of the widow to take
under the will shall be entered upon the minutes of the court; and if
the widow shall fail to make such election, she shall retain her dower,
and such share of the personal estate of her husband as she would be
entitled to by law in case her husband had died intestate, leaving chil­
dren. If she elect to take under the will, she shall he barred of her
dower and such share, and take under the will alone. unless as provided
in the next preceding section: provided, further, that said election by
the widow to take under the will, shall not bar her of the right to
remain in the mansion of her husband, and receive one vears allowance
for the support of herself and children, as provided by. law, unless the 
will shall expressly otherwise direct.
SEC. 5965. If the widow of the testator shall be unable to appear 
in court by reason of ill-health, or is not a resident of the county

sion, with a copy of the will annexed, directed to any suitable person,
to take the election of said widow, to accept the provisions of said will
in lieu of the provisions made for her by Jaw; and it shall be the duty
of the court in said commission to direct such person to explain to said
widow her rights under the will, and by law. 
SEc. 5966. If the widow of any testator shall be unable to make
an election by reason of insanity or imbecility of mind, it shall be the 
duty of the probate court, so soon as the facts shall come to the knowl­
edge of the court, at any time within one year after- the death of the
testator, to appoint some suitable person to ascertain the value of the
provision made by the testator for her in his will, in lieu of the provis­
ions made by law, and the value of her rights Ly law in the estate of
her husband ; and if the court shall be satisfied, on the coming in of
the report of the person appointed to make such investigation, that the
provision made by the testator for his widow, as aforesaid, in his will,
is more valuable and better for her than the provision by law, said court
shall enter upon its minute book, an election for said insane or imbecile
widow, that she, by virtue of the proceeding herein provided for by
the court, elects to take under the will of her husband, which election,
when so made, shall have the same force and effect as an election made 
by one not under such disability.

of a will, to any land situated in this state, derived from the heir or heirs

unless such will shall be offered for record in this state within four 
years from the final probate and establishment.of such will in the state 
.or territory in which it may have Leen admitted to probate: provided,
that the rights of infants, married women, or persons of insane mind
and memory, shall not be concluded by any delay or failure to record
such will in this state, until two years after their respective disabilities
are removed: provided, further, that no proceeding shall be had in this
state to contest a will executed and proved according to the law of any
state or territory of the United States, or of any foreign country, rela-
tive to property in this state; but if the said will shall be set aside in
the state, territory, or country in which it is executed and proved, the
same shall be held of no validity in this state as to all persons claiming
under said will, with notice of the same being set aside, as aforesaid;
and as to all other persons, from the time that an authenticated copy
of the final order or decree setting the same aside, is filed in the office
of the probate judge of the county in which said will is recorded. 
 
SEC. 5968. When lands, tenements, or hereditaments are given by
will, to any person for his life, and after his death to his heirs in fee, or 
by words to that effect, the conveyance shall be construed to vest an

his heirs. 
SEc. 5969. Any estate, right, or interest, in lands or personal
estate or other property acquired by the testator after the making of his
will, shall pass thereby, in like manner as if held or possessed at the
time of making the will, if such shall clearly and manifestly appear by 
the will to have been the intention of the testator. 
SEC. 5970. Every devise of lands, tenements, or hereditaments,
in any will hereafter made, shall be construed to convey all the estate

estate. 
SEC. 5971. When a devise of real or personal estate is made to any
child or other relative of the testator, if such child or other relative shall
have been dead at the time of the making of the will, or shall die there­

take the estate devised in the same manner as the devisee would have
done, if he had survived the testator: or if such devisee shall leave no
such issue, and the devise be of a residuary estate to him or her, and
other child or relative of the testator, the estate devised shall pass to,
and vest in such residuary devisee surviving the testator, unless a dif­
ferent disposition shall be made or required by the will.
SEC. 5972. When any part of the real estate of a testator shall
descend to his heirs by reason of its not being devised or disposed of
by his will, and his personal estate shall be insufficient for the payment
of his debts, the undevised real estate shall be first chargeable with the
debts, in exoneration, as far as it will go, of the real estate that is
devised, unless it shall appear from the will, that a different arrange­
ment of his assets, for the payment of his debts, was made by the tes­
tator; in which case they shall be applied for that purpose in conforn> 
ity with the provisions of the will. 
SEc. 5973. When any estate, real or personal, that is devised shall
be taken from the devisee for the payment of the debts of the testator,
all the other devisees and legatees shall contribute their respective pro­
portions of the loss to the person from whom the estate is taken, so as
to make the loss fall equally on all the devisees and legatees, accord­
ing to the value of the property received by each of them, excepting 
as provided in the following section. 
SEC. 5974. If, in such case, the testator shall, by making a specific
devise or bequest, have virtually exempted any devisee or legatee 
from his liability to contribute, with the others, for the payment of the
debts, or if he shall, by any other provision in the will, have prescribed
or required any appropriation of his estate, for the payment of his
debts, different from that prescribed in the preceding section, the estate 
shall be ap~ropriated and applied in conformity with the provisions of
the will.
SEC. 59 5. Nothing contained in the two preceding sections shall
impair, or in any way affect, the liability of the whole estate of the tes- 
tator, for the payment of his debts; but the provisions of these sections
shall apply only to the marshaling of the assets as between those who
hold or c1aim under the will. 
SEC. 5976. When any part o( the estate o( the testator descends
to a C I Orn a ter t e execution O t e WI , Or to a C I a sent an
reported to be dead. or to a witness to a will who is a devisee or lega- 
tee, sue estate an t e a vancement ma e to sue c 1 or witness
shall, for all the purposes mentioned in the three preceding sections, 
be considered as if it had been devised to such child or witness; and
he shall accordingly be bound to contribute with the devisees and lega-
tees, as before provided, and shall be entitled to claim contribution
from them accordingly. 
SEC. 5977. When any of the persons who are liable to contribute
toward the discharge of such debt, according to the provisions contained 
m t e rour prece mg sections, s a] msolvent or unable to pay rs 
just proportion thereof, the others shall be severally liable to each other,
for the loss occasioned by such insolvency, each one in proportion to 
the value of the property received by him, from the estate of the
deceased; and if any one of the persons so liable shall die, without
having paid his proportion of such debt, his executors and administra-
tors shall be liable therefor, in like manner as if it had been his proper
debt, to the extent to which he should have been liable if living. 

SEC. 578. All cases arising under this chapter, in which devisees
or legatees may be required to contribute to make up the share of any 
child born after the execution of the will, or of a child absent and
reported to be dead, or of a witness to the will, or in which contribu-
tion is to be made among devisees, legatees, and heirs, or any of them,
may be heard and determined in a single action. 
SEc. 5979. Nothing in the foregoing sections contained, shall pre-
vent the court, when a sale of lands aliened or unaliened, by a devisee
or heir is ordered for the payment of the debts of the estate, to make 
such order and decree for the sale of any portion of the aliened or
unaliened land, as may be equitable between the several parties, and
also to make such order of contribution, and such further order and
decree as will fully settle and adjust the various rights and liabilities of
the parties, which arise by reason of the alienation or the order of sale,
or otherwise.

will take upon themselves the execution thereof, or if all the executors
who take out letters testamentary, die, resign, or be removed before the
sale and conveyance of such estate, or die, resign, or be removed after

with to the executor or administrator who may supersede him, the prop-
erty and effects of the estate, as hereinafter provided.
SEC. 6010. Upon the granting of letters testamentary or of adrnin-
istration, the power of the special administrator shall cease, and he

the hands of the original administrator, until the final determination of
such proceedings to contest, when, if the will is sustained, the first
administration shall be revoked; and in either case, upon the revoca­
tion of the first administration and the appointment of 'an executor or
administrator with the will annexed, the executor or administrator with
the will annexed shall be admitted to prosecute or defend any suit,

cause extend the time for sale; and provided, further, that whenever
the court shall be satisfied, upon good and sufficient proof, that it would
be for the advantage of the estate of the decedent to sell any part of
said personal estate not taken hy the widow at the valuation made by
the appraisers, at private sale, the court may authorize the executor or
administrator to sell the personal estate, or any part or pared thereof
at private sale, either for cash or upon such other terms as said court

not be authorized to sell such property at private sale, at less than its

the estate to sell the same at a less price, in which case such court may
authorize such executor or administrator to sell the same for a less

or administrator, is desperate: Ist, on account of the doubtful solvency
or actual insolvency of the person or persons owing the same; 2d, on
account of such debtor having availed him or herself of the bankrupt 
law of the United States; 3d, by reason of some legal or equitable
defense which such debtor or debtors shall allege and make appear
against the same; 4th, on account of· the smallness of such claim and
difficulty in its collection, either from the remoteness of the residence
of the debtor, or the ignorance of the executor or administrator of such
residence; the court may order such claim, debt, or demand to be com­
pounded or sold, or to be filed in such court for the benefit of the heirs,
devisees, or creditors of such deceased person as will sue for or recover
the same, giving the creditors the preference, if they or any of them
apply for the same before the final settlement of the estate, and such
order of the court shall be a sufficient voucher to such executor or
administrator.

eign administrator or executor appointed by the laws of any other state
or country, and residing in this state, or having assets or property in
the same, and the several courts of probate, and courts of common
pleas, and superior courts, shall have like power and authority over
said foreign executor and administrator the same as if appointed by
the laws of this state. 
SEC. 6131. Any court of common pleas or superior court in this
state may compel any foreign administrator or executor residing in this 
state, or having assets or property in the same, to account at the suit
of any heir, distributee, or legatee, who is resident in this state, and
may make distribution of the amount found in his hands to the respect-
ive heirs, distributees, or legatees, according to the law of the state
granting said letters; and when there are suits pending, or any unset-
tled demands against said estate, the court may require a refunding
bond to be given to' said executor or administrator by the heirs, dis-
tributees, or legatees entitled thereto in case the amount paid shall be 
needed for the purpose of paying debts of said estate. 
SEc. 6132. When any foreign administrator or executor has wasted,
misapplied, or converted any of the assets of said estate, or has insuffi- 
· di h h' 1· bili f "d h.

SEc. 6133. An executor or administrator, duly appointed in any
other state or country. may commence and prosecute any action or pro- 
ceeding, in any court in this state, in his capacity of executor or adrnin- 
istrator, in like manner and under like restrictions, as a non-resident may
be permitted to sue. 
SEC. 6134. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by
wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or default is 
such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to
maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof: then, and
in every such case, the person who, or the corpo;ation which would
have been liable if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for
damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although
the death shall have been caused under such circumstances, as amount
in law to murder in the first or second degree, or manslaughter. 

SEc. 6135. Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife
or husband and parents and children, or if there be neither of them,
then of the next of kin, of the person whose death shall be so caused,
and it shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representa­
tive of the person deceased; and in every such action the jury may give
such damages, not exceeding in any case ten thousand dollars, as they
may think proportioned to the pecuniary injury resulting from such
death, to the persons, respectively, for whose benefit such action shall
be brought; and the amount recovered, after deducting the costs and 
expenses chargeable to such representative, shall be divided among the
before mentioned persons in such proportions as the jury by their ver­
dict may find and direct: provided, that the personal representative
may, without suit, 
the defendant the amount to be paid, but if such personal representa­
tive was appointed in this state, such settlement shall first be approved by
the court making the appointment; and in case of settlement, either
without suit or before verdict, the apportionment among the beneficia­
ries, unless adjusted among themselves, shall be made by the court mak­
ing the appointment, whether the same was made within or without the 
state. 
SEC. 6136. As soon as the executor or administrator shall ascertain
that the personal estate in his hands will be insufficient to pay all the
debts of the deceased, with the allowance to the widow and children,
for their support, twelve months, and the charges of administering the
estate, he shall apply to the probate court or the court of common
pleas for authority to sell the real estate of the deceased. 
SEC. 6137. In order to obtain such authority, the executor or
administrator shall commence a civil action· in the probate court or the 
court of common pleas of either the county in which the real estate of
the deceased, or any part thereof, is situate, or of the county in which
were issued his letters testamentary or of administration.
SEC. 6138. If the executor or administrator, who shall commence
such action, for the sale of real estate, shall die, resign, or be removed, 
or his powers shall cease at any time before the conveyance of the same,
under an order of the court, the administrator de bonis non shall pro­
ceed with such sale, and may convey the land sold before or after his
appointment, and may be required to give an additional bond in like 
manner as if such administrator de bonis non had filed the petition. 

SEC. 6139. The real estate liable to Le sold as aforesaid, shall
include all that the deceased may have conveyed with intent to defraud
his creditors, and all other rights and interests in lands, tenements, and
hereditaments: provided, that lands so fraudulently conveyed, shall not
be taken from any one who purchased them for a valuable considera­
tion, in good faith, and without knowledge of the fraud; and no claim
to lands so fraudulently conveyed, shall be made, unless within four 
years next after the decease of the grantor. 
SEC. 6140. If land is to be included in such action which has been
so fraudulently conveyed, the executor or administrator may either
before or at the same time, bring an action for the recovery of the pos­ 
session of such land; or he may in his action for the sale thereof 
allege the fraud and have the fraudulent conveyance avoided therein;
but when such land is included in the application before a recov cry
of the possession thereof the action shall be in the court of cornnon 
pleas. 
SEc. 6141. The petition shall, in all cases, set forth the amount of
debts due from the deceased, as nearly as they can be ascertained,
and the amount of the charges of administration, the value of the per­
sonal estate and effects, and a description of the real estate, and the
value thereof, if appraised. 
SEC. 6142. In such action the widow o( the deceased, and the
heirs, devisees, or persons having the next estate of inheritance from
the deceased, and all mortgagees and other lien holders, whether Ly 
judgment or otherwise, of any of the lands sought to be sold, and all
trustees holding the legal title thereto or to any part thereof; and when
a fraudulent conveyance is sought to be set aside in such action, all
persons holding or claiming thereunder shall be made parties.
SEC. 6143. Service, either actual or constructive, shall be made in
the same manner as in other civil actions· provided that if all per- 
· ·  
sons in interest consent, in writing, to. the sale, service of process may
· be dispensed with; and legal guardians may sign such corisent for their 
wards, except guardians of the person only of minors; or, unless
otherwise ordered by the court, .t~e summons may be. 'served by the 
·plaintiff. or other person, by copy personally, and the return ·or such
service shall be verified by the' oath of the person who makes the
same; .and all proceedings in the 'action in either court shall be the
same as in other civil actions, except as otherwise herein provided.

SEC. 6144. It shall not- be .necessary, unless the prayer of. the peti-
tion for a sale. is contested, to appoint guardians ad litem for infant 
heirs or devisees or other persons having the next estate ofjnhcritance 
from the · deceased who are defendants; and no such guardian shall

ave aut onty to waive notice· or service. o summons. 3
SEC. 6145. Theprobate court or court of common pleasin which 
such action may be pending, shall have full power to determine· the
equities between the parties and the priorities of lien of the several
lien holders on said real estate, and to order a, distribution of the money
arising from the sale of such r zal estate, according to the respective
equities and priorities of lien as found by the court. 
SEC. 6146. An. order for the sale of the real estate shall not be·
granted if any of the persons jnterested in the estate shall give bond to 
the executor or administrator, in 'a sum and with sureties to be ap-
proved of by. the court, with condition to pay all the debts mentioned
in the petition that shall eventually be found due from the estate, with
the charges of administering the same, and the allowance in. money to
the widow, so far as the personal estate of the deceased shall be insuffi-
cient therefor. (38 v. 146, § 129.J ,

so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of the debts, to

exceeding two years, with interest. r 38 v. 146, § 130.] 
SEC. 6148. The court may include in its order of sale, the title of

t e errs or evisees O t e ecease , m t e premises set O to t e 
widow for her dower, which may be sold subject to the life estate of
the widow therein.
SEC. 6149. If it shall be represented in such petition and shall
appear to the court that it is necessary to sell some part of the real 
estate, and that, by such partial sale, the residue of the estate, or some
specific part or piece thereof, would be greatly injured, the court may 
order a sale of the whole of the estate, or of such part thereof as the
court shall think necessary and most for the interest of all concerned
therein.
SEC. 6100. When, in cases named in the next preceding section, the
executor or administrator is ordered to sell more than is necessary for 
the payment of the debts, he shall, before the sale, give bond with
sufficient sureties payable to the state, conditioned to account for all
the proceeds of the sale that shall remain, after payment of the debts
and charges for which the land shall be sold, and to dispose of the 
same according to law. 
SEC. 6161. The court may also require of any executor or admin- 
 ·f · h JI d · 1. r. h I · ddi
1~trator, 1 _it_s a . eem it necessary, uerore sue sa e, to -~tve an a 1- 
tional administration bond, to secure the further assets ansmg from the
sale of the real estate, and the bond mentioned in this section, and the 
bond mentioned in the next preceding section, shall, when so ordered
to be given, be given in the court from which the letters were issued,
and ii the action is pending in another court, the latter court shall pro­
ceed no further till there is filed therein a certificate from the former
court, under the seal thereof, that such bond has been given as ordered. 

SEC. 6162. Ii there should be in the last will of the deceased any
disposition of his estate for the payment of his debts, or any provision 
that may require or induce the court to marshal the assets, in any man-
ner different from that which the law would otherwise prescribe, such
devises, or parts of the will, shall be set forth in the petition, an<l a copy
of the will shall be exhibited to the court, and the assets shall be mar­
shaled accordingly, so far as it can be done, consistently with the rights 
of the creditors. 
SEC. 6163. If any party shall, in his answer, object to the granting
an order for the sale of the real estate, by an executor or administrator,
and it shall on hearing appear to the court that either the petition or 
the objection thereto is unreasonable, it may, in its discretion, award
costs to the party prevailing on that issue. 
SEC. 6164. If the deceased did not leave a widow, entitled to
dower in the estate to be sold, and an appraisement of such real estate 
.  d · h · h d } di
is contame mt e inventory, t e court may or er a sa e accor mg to 
said appraisement, or order a new appraisement. If the court do not 
order a new appraisement, the appraisement set forth in the inventory 
shall be deemed the appraised value of the real estate; but if the court
order a new apprais~ment, the value returned by such appraisers shall 
be deemed the appraised value of the real estate. The order of sale.
and the order for the appraisement, may be made at the same time, if 
no assigr.ment of dower is required. 
SEC. 6166. Except in cases where there has been a valuation of
the real estate in the inventory, and the court dispense with another 
appraisement, the court shall, upon finding that a sale is necessary,
appoint three judicious, disinterested men of the vicinity, who are
freeholders, to appraise the lands at their true value in money; and, if
the deceased left a widow entitled to dower in the premises, the court
shall also order that said freeholders set off and assign to her, in each 
or in one or more of the tracts of land, by metes and bounds, one
equal third part of the whole lands in which she is entitled to dower,
as and for such dower, and to appraise the whole premises, either as a
whole or in parcels, subject to such dower so assigned; but if on view,
the appraisers find that the dower cannot be so assigned, they shall
then assign such dower specially as of the rents and profits; and if
the lands lie in two or more counties, the court may, if it think fit,
appoint appraisers in more than one of the counties. In all cases a 
copy of the order to be executed shall be issued to the executor or
administrator. 
SEC. 6156. When any person appointed by the court as an appraiser,
fails to discharge his duties, the probate judge or any justice of the
peace of the county in which the lands to be appraised are situate, may,
at the instance of the executor or administrator, appoint an appraiser,
of which appointment the officer appointing shall make and sign acer-
tificate which shall be returned with the appraisement; or the executor
or administrator may apply to the court making the order of appraise-
ment and have another appraiser appointed thereby. 
SEC. 6157. The appraisers shall be sworn by some officer author-
ized to administer oaths. and a certificate thereof shall be inserted in 
d

for services performed by them in the county in which they reside, and 
two dollars per day for services performed without such county. 
SEC. 6159. The executor or administrator shall, if the sale is to be
public, give notice of the time and place of sale, by advertising the
same, at least four weeks successively, in some newspaper printed in
the county where the lands are situate; or if no newspaper be printed
therein, by advertisements posted up in at least five public places in the
county, four weeks before the day of sale. 
SEC. 6160. The lands, if improved, shall not be sold for less than
two-thirds of the appraised value· and if not improved for not less 
, ,  , ' 
than one-half the appraised value; but after being twice offered for
l
h 
di h fi hi h h h 11 b Id
sa e, t e court may irect t e amount or w ic t ey s a e so , or 
may set aside the appraisement and order a new one. 

SEC. 6161. The sale shall be made at public vendue, at the door of
the court house in the county in which the order o.f sale shall _have been 
made, or at such other place as the court may direct: provided, how-
ever, that if it is made to appear to the court that it will be more for
the interest of said estate to sell such real estate at private sale, the 
court may authorize said petitioner to sell the same, either in whole or
in part, for cash in hand, or upon deferred payments, not exceeding
two years, with interest; and in no case shall such real estate be sold
at private. sale for less than the appraised value thereof. 
SEC. 6162. The executor or administrator shall make return of his 
proceedings, under the order of sale; and the court after having care­ 
fully examined such return, and being satisfied that the sale has in all
respects been legally made, shall confirm the sale, and order the execu­
tor or administrator to make a deed to the purchaser; and may, in the
order, require that before the delivery of such deed the deferred install­
ments of the purchase money shall be· secured by mortgage. 

SEC. 6163. The deed of the executor or administrator, made in
pursuance of the order of the court. shall be received in all courts as
prirna facie evidence that the executor or administrator in all respects
observed the directions and complied with the requisitions of the law,
and shall vest the title in the purchaser, in like manner as if conveyed
by the deceased in his lifetime. 
SEC. 6164. If the appraisers shall have assigned dower specially
of the rents and profits, and the purchaser takes, by the deed of the 
executor or administrator, the lands upon which such dower has been
assigned, the court shall make such orders as will secure to the widow
a charge on such lands, for the dower so assigned. (38 v. 146, ~ 149.] 
Sze. 6165. The money arising from the sale of real estate shall be
applied in the following order: 

F irst-e-'I o discharge the costs and expenses of the sale, and the per
centum and charges of the executor or administrator thereon, for his
administration of the same. 
Second-To the payment of mortgages and judgments against the
deceased, according to their respective priorities of lien, so· far as the
same operate as a lien on the estate of the deceased, at the time of his
death; which. shall be apportioned and determined by the court: on
reference to a master or otherwise. 
Third-To the discharge of claims and debts, in the order men­
tioned in this ti:le. . 
SEc. 6166. Wh,en a petition is filed for the sale of an equitable
estate, or any equitable interest, which the deceased held in any lands, 
the executor or administrator shall set forth in the petition the nature of
such equitable csate or interest, making all necessary parties, including
the persons holding the legal title thereto and those who are entitled to·
the purchase money therefor; and the court may, in such case, not-
withstanding the· preceding provisions of this title, make such order
for the appraiscment and sale of such equitable estate, for the indem-
nity of the estate of the deceased against the claim· for such purchase
money, and for the adjustment of the dower of the widow of the
deceased, in such equitable estate, hy estimating and directing to be
paid to her the value of a life annuity in one-third of such equitable
estate or otherwise, as it may deem just and right, between all parties
in interest. (38 v, 146, ~ 151.] 
SEC. 6167. If any executor or administrator, duly qualified, is
authorized by will or devise, to sell real estate, no order shall be 
required from the court to authorize him to act m fursuance of the
power vested in him by such will. (38 v. 146, § 153. 
SEC. 6168. When an executor or administrator shall be appointed
in any other state, territory, or foreign country, on the estate of any 
person dying out of this state, and no executor or administrator thereon
shall be appointed in this state, the foreign executor or administrator
may file an authenticated copy of his appointment in the probate court
of any county in which there may be any real estate of the deceased,
together with an authenticated copy of the will, if there be one; after
which he may be authorized, under an order of the court, to sell real
estate for the payment of debts or legacies and charges of administra-
tion, in the same manner and upon the same terms and conditions as 
are prescribed in the case of an executor or administrator appointed in
this state, excepting in the particulars in which a different provision is
hereinafter made. 
SEC. 6169. When it shall appear to the court granting the order
of sale that such foreign executor or administrator is bound with suffi­ 
cient surety or sureties in the state or country in which he was
appointed, to account for the proceeds of such sale, for the payment of
debts or legacies and charges of administration, and a copy of such
bond, duly authenticated, shall be filed in court, no further bond for
that purpose shall be required of him here; otherwise, before making
such sale, he shall give bond, with two or more sufficient sureties, to
the state of Ohio, with condition to account for and dispose of the
said proceeds for the payment of the debts or legacies of the deceased
and the charges of administration, according to the laws of the state or
country in which he was appointed.
SEc. 6170. When such foreign executor or administrator is author­
ized by order of the court to sell more than is necessary for the pay­
ment of debts, legacies, and charges of administration, as hereinbefore
provided, he shall, before making the sale, give bond, with two or
more sufficient sureties, to the state of Ohio, with condition to account,
before the court, for all the proceeds of the sale that shall remain after
payment of said debts, legacies, and charges, and to dispose of the 
same according to law.
SEC. 6171. In all cases of a sale by an executor or administrator
of part or the whole of the real estate of the deceased, under an order
of court, whether such executor or administrator shall have been ap- 
pointed in this state or elsewhere, the surplus of the proceeds of the
sale remaining on the final settlement of the account, shall be consid­ 
ered as real estate, and shall be disposed of accordingly. 
SEC. 6172. When a testator shall have given any legacy by will 
that is effectual to pass or charge real estate, and his personal estate
shall be insufficient to pay such legacy, together with his debts, the 
allowance to the widow and children, and the costs of administration,
the executor or administrator, with the will annexed, may be ordered
to sell his real estate for that purpose, in the same manner and upon
the same terms and conditions as are prescribed herein for the payment 
of debts. 
SEC. 6173. If at a.ny time after the institution ~r. proceedings for
the partiuon of the lands of any deceased person, it is found that the 
· l h d f h d · · f h d d
assets in t le an SO t e executor or a rmrnstrator O sue ecease , 
are probably in~u!ficie~t to pay the indebtedness. ~f the estate and ex­
penses of administration, the executor or administrator shall make a
written statement to the probate court of the said assets and indebted- 
  
ness and expenses, and the court shall forthwith ascertain the amount
necessary to pay the said indebtedness and expenses in addition to the 
assets, and ~ive a certificate thereof to the executor or administrator.

J 
SEc. 6174. The executor or administrator shall thereupon present 
· if h · hi h h di r. '· 
said certi cate to t e court in w ic t e procee mgs tor partition are,
or have been pending, and on his motion said court shall order the 
amount named in said certificate as necessary, to be paid over to the
executor or administrator out of the proceeds of the sale of the prem-
ises, if the same shall be thereafter sold, or have already been sold:
provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to pro-
hibit any executor or administrator from proceeding to sell land be-
longing to such estate to pay any debts, when the same has been sold
on partition or otherwise or the proceeds of such sale fully distributed. 

SEC. 6175. Every executor or administrator shall, within eighteen
months after having given bond for the discharge of his trust, render
his account of his administration upon oath, and he shall in like man­
ner render such further accounts of his administration, from time to
time, and every twelve months thereafter; and also at such other times
as may be required by the court until the estate shall be wholly settled;
and he may be examined on oath upon any matter relating to his
accounts, the payments therein mentioned, and also touching any prop­
erty or effects of the deceased which have come to his hands: pro­
vided, that when an executor or administrator has died before the
estate is fully administered, it shall be the duty of the executor or
administrator of such deceased executor or administrator to render a
final account of such decedent's administration within six months after
his appointment. 
SEC. 6176. When any account is rendered by two or more joint
executors or administrators, the court may, in its discretion, allow the 
account upon the oath of any one of them. (38 v. 146, § 162.] 
SEC. 6177. The time allowed by the court to collect the assets of
the estate, shall not operate as an allowance of further time to file the 
accounts mentioned in the preceding sections. (38 v. 146, § 163.] 
SEC. 6178. If any executor or administrator shall fail to render 
his accounts, as herei'nbefore directed, he may be compelled-to do so
in the manner hereinbefore directed lo compel the return - of an inven­
tory; and the same proceedings may be had to attach the party, and to
discharge him, and the like revocation of the letters granted to him may
be made in case of the party's absconding or concealing himself, so
that no order can be personally served, or of his neglecting to render
an account within thirty days after being committed; and new letters
shall be granted with the like effect and like remedies as in those cases. 

SEC. 6179. Every executor or administrator shall be chargeable
with the amount of the sale-bill, as herein before provided, and also, with
all goods, chattels, rights, and credits of the deceased which shall come
to his hands, and which are by law to be administered, although they
should not be included in the inventory or sale-bill; also, with all the
proceeds of real estate, sold for the payment of debts or legacies, and
with all the interest, profit, and income that shall in any way come to
his hands from the personal estate of the deceased. 
SEC. 6180. No profits shall Le made by executors or administra­
tors, by the increase, nor shall they sustain any loss by the decrease or
destruction, without their fault, of any part of the estate. 
SEC. 6181. No executor or administrator shall be accountable for
any debts inventoried as due to the deceased, if it shall appear to the
court that they remain uncollected without his fault. 
SEC. 6182. If any executor or administrator shall neglect to sell
any portion of the personal property which he is bound by law to sell, 
and retains, consumes, or disposes of the same, for his own benefit, he
shall be charged therewith at double the value affixed thereto by the 
appraisers. 
SEC. 6183. In rendering such account, every executor or admin­ 
istrator shall produce vouchers for all debts and legacies paid, and
for all funeral charges and just and necessary expenses, which vouch­
ers shall be filed with the account, and they, together with the account,
shall be deposited and remain in the probate court. 
SEC. 6184. On the settlement of an account of an executor or 
· · ' di d
administrator, he may be allowed any Item of expen iture, not excee - 
ing ten dollars, for which no voucher is produced, if such item be
supported by his own oath positively to the fact of payment, specify­
ing when and to whom such payment was made, and if such oath be
uncontradicted; but such allowance shall not, in the whole, exceed
two hundred dollars, for payments in behalf of any one estate. 

SEc. 6185. The court may also, on settlement, allow, as a credit 
to the executor or administrator, any just and reasonable amount
expended by him for a tombstone or monument for the deceased; 
hut it shall not he incumbent on any executor or administrator to pro­
cure a tombstone or monument. 
SEC. 6186. The court may, if it shall deem it expedient and proper,
refer the account and the exceptions thereto. if any, to a special com­ 
missioner, appointed by the court for that parposc. 
SEC. 6187. When an account is settled in the absence of any per­
son adversely interested, and without actual notice to him, the account 
may be opened, on his filing exceptions to the account, at any time
within eight months thereafter; and upon every settlement of an
account by an executor or administrator, all his former accounts may
be so far opened as to correct any mistake or error therein; except­
ing that any matter of dispute between two parties, which had been
previously heard, and determined by the court, shall not be again
brought in question, by either of the same parties, without leave of 
the court. 
SEC. 6188. Executors ancf administrators may be allowed the fol­
lowing commissions upon the amount of the personal estate collected
and accounted for by them, and of the proceeds of the real estate sold

of the will which shall be received in full compensation for all their
ordinary services; that is to say: 
For the first thousand dollars, at the rate of six per centurn ; 
For all above that sum, and not exceeding five thousand dollars, at
the rate of four per cent um; and 
For all above five thousand dollars, at the .rate of two per centum.
And in all cases. such further allowance shall be made as the court 
shall consider just and reasonable for actual and necessary expenses,
and for any extraordinary services, not required of an executor or ad­
ministrator, in the common course of his duty: provided, however,
that when provision shall be made by the will of the deceased, for com­
pensation to any executor, the same shall be deemed a full satisfaction
for his services, in lieu of his aforesaid commissions or his share thereof,
unless he shall, by an instrument filed in the court, renounce all claim
to such compensation given by the will. 
SEC. 6189. If an executor or administrator shall have paid all the
debts of the estate, without disposing of all the notes, bonds, 
stocks,
claims; and other rights in action, belonging to the estate, he may. with
the approval of the probate court,. entered on the journal at or after
the settlement of the estate, and with the assent and agreement of the
persons entitled to such assets as distributees, or otherwise, distribute 
1 
and pay over the same in kind to those of such persons as will receive
the same; and such distribution shall have the same force and effect as
the distribution of the proceeds of such assets. 
SEc. 6190. When an executor or administrator has paid or deliv­
ered over to the persons entitled thereto, the money or other property
in his hands as required by the order of distribution, or otherwise, he
may perpetuate the evidence of such payment by presenting to the
court, within one year after such order was made, an account of such
payments, or the delivery over of such property; which being proved
to the satisfaction of the court, and verified by the oath of the party,
shaJl be allowed as his final discharge, and ordered by the court to be
recorded; and such discharge shall forever exonerate the party. and his
sureties from all liability under such order, unless his account shall be 
impeached for fraud or manifest error. 
SEc. 6191. If any sum of money directed by a decree or order of
the court to be distributed to heirs, next of kin, or legatees, shall remain
for the space of six months unclaimed, the executor or administrator
who was ordered to pay over the same, may, by order of the court,
invest the same in stocks, or loan the same on bond and mortgage, as
the court shall direct, to accumulate for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto; and such investment shall be made in the name of the
judge of the court for the time being, and shall he subject to the order
of the judge and his successors in office, as hereinafter provided; and
the person making such investment shall file in the court a memorandum
thereof, with the original certificates, or other evidence of title thereto,
which shall be allowed as a sufficient voucher for such payment under
the said order or decree. 
SEC. 6192. When the person entitled to the money invested shall
satisfy the court of his right to receive the same, the court shall cause
it to be paid over and transferred to him. 
SEC. 6193. The judge with whom such certificates or evidences
of title are deposited, for the time being, and each succeeding judge
to whom they shall come, and his sureties, shall be responsible for their
safe-keeping and application, as provided in the two preceding sections 
of this chapter.
SEc. 6194. When the intestate shall not have left any legitimate 
child, heir of his body, the widow shall be entitled to all the personal
estate, as next of kin, which shall be subject to distribution upon set- 
tlement of the estate; and if the intestate shall have left such child, the
widow shall be entitled, upon distribution, to one-half of any sum not
exceeding four hundred dollars, and to one-third of the residue of. the
personal estate subject to distribution. (38 v. 146, § 180.] 
SEC. 6195. After thirty days from the time of the settlement of the
account of an executor or administrator shall have been made or shall 
hereafter be made by the probate court, and an order of distribution
made thereon, if such executor or administrator shall neglect or refuse
to pay to any person interested in said order of distribution, as creditor,
legatee, widow, heir, or other distributee, or otherwise, when demanded,
his or her share of the estate or property ordered to be distributed by
such probate court, it shall be lawful for any person interested, as afore-
said, to file a petition in the probate court against the executor or ad-
ministrator making such settlement of his or her account, as aforesaid,
briefly setting forth in the petition the amount and nature of the claim
of the party filing such petition, whereupon the probate judge shall
forthwith issue a citation against such executor or administrator, setting
forth the filing of the petition, the amount claimed by the petitioner,
and commanding such executor, administrator, or guardian, to appear
before said probate court on the return day thereof, to answer said
petition, and show cause, if any, why judgment should not be rendered
and execution awarded against him or her for the amount claimed by
such petitioner, and found to be due upon such settlement and order of
distribution, which citation shall be made returnable not less than
twenty nor more than forty days from the date thereof, which shall be
served and returned by the sheriff or other proper officer,-as in the case
of a summons, and may issue to any county in the state. 

SEC. 6196. But if such executor or administrator shall reside out
of this state, the court being satisfied of that fact, either before or
after the return of the citation, may order such non-resident to be 
brought into court, by publication in some newspaper of the county in
which the petition is filed, for six consecutive weeks before the time
fixed for the hearing of said cause; or in case no newspaper be pub-
lished in the county, then to be published in some newspaper having a
general circulation in said county. 
SEC. 6197. On the return of the citation served, or the service of
notice by publication, as aforesaid, the cause shall be considered ready 
for hearing, unless for good cause shown by either party the same
shall be continued for trial and judgment, as in other cases of contin-
uance, and if no good cause be shown, in defense of the claim of the
plaintiff in such petition, it shall be lawful for such probate court to
render judgment in favor of such plaintiff, against such executor or
administrator, for the amount found to be due to the petitioner, and
remaining unpaid, upon the settlement and order of distribution, as
aforesaid, with the interest and costs of suit, and to award execution 
thereon, as in other cases of judgments, which execution shall be
served and returned, by the sheriff or other proper officer, in all respects
as executions issued from the court of common pleas, and "all judgments
rendered under this section shall have like liens upon the real estate of
the parties as judgments rendered in the common pleas, and governed
in all respects by the same rules.
SEC. 6198. If the amount coming to any heir, legatee, widow, or
other distributee, under such order of distribution, shall be uncertain, 
. . . 
or in dispute, depending upon the construction of any devise, bequest,
conveyance, contract, or advancement, or upon any other question,
the probate judge may hear and determine all such questions necessary
to ascertain and fix the amount due the plaintiff in such petition, and.
if necessary, to hear and determine, and settle the rights and claims of
all the parties interested, as aforesaid. in such order of distribution,
and for that purpose the probate court is hereby authorized to cause all
the heirs, legatees, or other distributees, parties in interest, to he
made parties to said petition, when the same is necessary, by amended
or supplemental petition, and service of notice, as is provided in the
preceding section of this chapter, and in such case to render judgment
and award execution against such executor or administrator in favor
of the parties, respectively, for the amounts, respectively, found due
them, with the interest and costs, unless the court should be of opinion
the costs should be paid out of the estate ordered to be distributed,
or by the parties. in which case such order shall be made respecting
the costs as shall seem equitable.
SEC. 6199. In all cases under the sections of this chapter relating
to the enforcement of an order of distribution, the probate court before
which any proceeding shall be pending shall, on motion of any of the
parties to said proceeding, cause the same to be reserved and sent to
the court of common pleas of that county for trial and judgment and
execution, and in case of such reservation it shall be the duty of the
probate judge forthwith to make out a transcript of his proceedings in
the cause, so far as he has progressed in the same, which, together
with the petition, and all other papers in the cause, shall be forthwith
filed with the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county in
which the cause is commenced, and said cause shall thereafter be car­
ried on to final judgment and execution in said court of common pleas,
in all respects as though the same had been originally commenced 
there, as a civil action. 
SEC. 6200. The court of common pleas shall have concurrent
original jurisdiction with the probate court in all cases provided for 
, . . ' . 
m the four sections precedmg the next above, and any creditor, legatee,
widow, or other distributee, as aforesaid, may bring a civil action in the 
court of common pleas of the proper county, against such executor or
administrator, for his or her share of the estate, upon such settlement
and order of distribution, in the same manner as other civil actions,
and proceed therein to final judgment and execution, and be governed
in all respects as upon other civil actions, and to cause all persons inter­
ested in said cause, as heirs, legatees, distributees, or otherwise, to be
made parties to any action aforesaid, if it shall be deemed necessary,
in order to a full and complete settlement and adjustment of the rights
of the parties, in the same manner as other civil actions, with full power
and authority to settle and determine the rights of the parties, and ren­
der judgment and award execution thereon as in other cases. 

SEC. 6201. The sureties of every such executor or administrator
shall moreover be liable upon the official bond of the executor or 
administrator against whom any judgment may be rendered under the
provisions of the preceding sections, either in the probate court or
court of common ple ts ; and such sureties may be made parties to any
such judgment by petition or action to be commenced and prosecuted
in the same manner as is above provided for the commencement and
prosecuting causes against executors or administrators, to final judg­
ment and execution: provided, that in all cases in which service ot 
process shall have been made upon such executors or administrators,

the same defense as the executor or administrator could have made. 
SEC. 6202. Any executor, administrator, guardian, or other trustee,
may maintain a civil action in the court of common pleas against the 
 J ' ib h · ki h di .
creditors, egatees, distri utees, or ot er parties, as mg t e irecnon or 
judgment of the court in any matter respecting the trust, estate, or
property to be administered, and the rights of the parties in interest, in
the same manner, and as fully as was formerly· entertained in courts
of chancery; and in case any executor, administrator, guardian, or other
trustee, after being requested in writing by any creditor, legatee, dis-
tributee, or other party in interest, to bring such action, fail for thirty
days so to do, the creditor, legatee, distributee, or other party making 
such request, may institute the same. 

SEC. 6203. Appeals shall be allowed from any final order.judgment,
or decree of the probate court to the court of common pleas, by any 
person against whom any such order, judgment, or decree may he made,
or who may he affected thereby, in the same manner as is provided
for appeals from the probate court to the common: pleas in other
cases; appeals shall also be allowed from any order or judgment of
the court of common pleas, in like manner, to the district court, in pro-
ceedings under the sections herein relating to the enforcement of
orders of distribution, by any person against whom any such judgment
or order may be rendered, or who may be affected thereby, to the
same extent and in the same manner as is provided for appeals from
the eommon pleas in other cases; and bills of exceptions may be
taken and allowed upon any decision of the probate court, court of 
common pleas, or district court, in proceedings in this behalf, as in
other cases. 

SEC. 6204. Any surety of an executor or administrator, or the
executor or administrator of any such surety, may, at any time, make 
application to the proper probate court to be released from the bond
of such executor or administrator, by filing his written request there-
for with the judge of said court, and giving at least five days' notice,
in writing, to such executor or administrator; and if such court upon
the hearing is of opinion there is good reason therefor, the court shall
release such surety, and the death of a surety shall always be deemed
good cause; and if such executor or administrator fail to give new
bond, as by such court directed, he shall be removed, and his · letters
superseded; but such original surety shall not be released until such
executor or administrator so gives bond, and such original sureties shall
be liable only for the acts of such executor or administrator from the
time of the execution of the original bond to the filing of the second
bond; and the costs of such proceeding shall be paid by the surety
applying to be released, unless it shall appear to the court that the
administrator or executor is insolvent, incompetent, or is wasting the
assets of the estate. 
SEC. 6206. Whenever the sureties in any bond of an executor or
administrator shall be insufficient, the court on the petition of any per- 
son interested, and after notice to the principal in the bond, may require
a new bond to be given, with two or more sufficient sureties. 

SEc. 6206. When a new bond shall be required as above provided,
the sureties in the prior bond shall, nevertheless, be liable for all breaches
of the condition, committed before the new bond shall be approved by 
the court. 
SEC. 6207. If, in the cases specified in the two preceding sec­
tions, the principal shall not give such new bond, within such time as
shall be ordered by the court, he shall be removed from his trust, and
some other person may be appointed in his stead, as the circumstances 
of the case may require.
SEC. 6208. If any executor or administrator shall waste, or unfaith-
fully administer the estate, the court granting the letters may, if it thinks 
fit, on· the application of any surety in the administration bond, order
such executor or administrator to render an account, and to execute to 
such surety a bond of indemnity, with surety or sureties approved by
the court; and upon neglect or refusal to execute such bond of indem­
nity within the time ordered by the court, it may remove him, and re­
voke his letters testamentary, or letters of administration, and appoint
another administrator in his place. 
SEC. 6209. If an executor or administrator shal! unreasonably
delay' to raise money, by collecting the debts and effects of the deceased, 
or by selling the real estate, if necessary, and if he can obtain an order
therefor, or shall neglect to pay what he has in his hands; and if, in
consequence of such delay or neglect, the estate of the deceased shall
be taken in execution by any of his creditors, it shall be deemed un­
faithful administration in such executor or administrator, and he shall
be liable on his administration bond for all damages occasioned thereby. 

SEC. 6210. After a creditor is entitled by law to the payment of
his debt, from the executors or administrators, and the amount of the 
claim has either been admitted to be just or allowed by them, or has
been ascertained by judgment or award against them, or by an order
of distribution, the bond given by them for the discharge of their trust,
may be put in suit by such creditor, if the executors or administrators
shall neglect, upon demand made by such creditor, to pay such claim. 

SEC. 6211. Such suit may also be brought by a legatee, after he
shall be entitled to the payment of his legacy, and by the widow, or 
other distributee, to recover his or her share of the personal estate,
after an order of the court, ascertaining the amount due to him or her, 
if the executor or administrator shall neglect to pay the same when
demanded. 
SEc. 6212. When it shall appear to the probate court, ~n the repre­
sentation of any person interested in the estate of any deceased testa­
tor or intestate, that the executor or administrator has failed to per­
form his duty, in any other particular than those above specified in the
two preceding sections, the court may authorize any creditor, next of kin,
legatee, or other person aggrieved by such maladministration, to bring 
a suit on the bond. 
SEc. 6213. In an'. actions on any bond of an administrator or
executor, for a breach thereof, by not filing his final account at the time
required by law, or by order of the court, the defendant may aver and
give in evidence any facts tending to show that the said breach did not
occur by reason of neglect or unreasonable delay of the administrator
or executor to settle the estate or tile said account; and if the defend­
ant shall make good his defense, he shall recover of the plaintiff his
costs; and in no case brought for such breach shall the plaintiff recover 
more costs than damages. 
SEC. 6214. In all cases when the powers of an executor or admin­
istrator cease by death, removal, resignation, or in any other manner,
or shall have heretofore so ceased, any succeeding administrator, or
co-executor, or co-administrator, may maintain an action on the bond
of such executor or administrator whose powers have ceased, against
any of the obligors thereof, or their legal representatives, for any breach
of the conditions of the bond. 
SEc. 6215. An action on the bond may be brought in the court of
common. pleas or superior court of the county in which it was given,
for the particular relief only to which the plaintiff is entitled, or it may 
be framed, either in the· petition or in any cross-petition filed in the
case, with a view to a settlement of all matters for which the principal
in the bond is accountable, and any heirs, devisees, legatees, widow, or
next of kin. or others, who may be liable on account of assets having
come into. their hands, or who may otherwise be proper or necessary
parties, may be made defendants; and when the action is framed for
that purpose and· the necessary parties are before the court, the court
may adjust and settle the estate in whole or in 'part, Tendering all judg­
ments required, arid may award costs as may be deemed proper. 

SEC. 6216. When suit is brought upon the administration bond, by
a creditor whose claim has been allowed or admitted bv the executor or
administrator, such allowance or admission shall be· prima facie evi­
dence only of the validity and justice of such claim; and the executor
oradministrator or other defendants may, in the suit upon the admin­
istration bond, contest the same, and the court may determine, by the
verdict of a jury, if either party require it, the amount· or justice of the
claim; and if neither party require a jury, the court shall, by reference
to a master or otherwise, decide upon the daim. 
SEC. 6217. After the settlement of any estate by an executor or 
administrator, and after the expiration of the time limited for the com­
mencement of actions against him by the creditors of the deceased, the
heirs, next of kin, widow as next of kin, devisees, and legatees of the
deceased, shall be liable by action in the common pleas or superior
court, in the manner provided in the following sections, for all debts,
which could not have been sued for, against the executor or adminis­
trator, and for which provision shall not have been made as hcrcinbe­ 
fore provided. 
SEC. 6218. Any such creditor whose right of action shall firs: cccrue
after the expiration of the time of such limitation, and whose claim
shall not have been presented to the court, or if presented shall r ot 
have been allowed, as hereinbefore provided, may recover the same
against the heirs, widow as next of kin, and next of kin of the deceased,
and the devisees and legatees under his will, each one of whom shall
be liable to the creditor to an amount not exceeding the value, whether
of real or personal estate, that he or she shall have received under the
will, or by the distribution of the estate of the deceased : provided,
that if by the will of the deceased any part of his estate. or any one or
more of the devisees or legatees, shall be made exclusively liable for
the debt, in exoneration of the residue of the estate, or of the other
devisees or legatees, the provisions of the will shaJl be complied with
in that respect. and the persons and estate so exempt by the will, shall
be liable for only so much of the debt, if any, as can not be recovered
from those first chargeable therewith; and, provided further, no such
suit shall be maintained unless it be commenced within one year next
after the time when the right of action shall first accrue, except the
person entitled to bring any action mentioned in this section be, at the
time the cause of action accrued, within the age of twenty-one years if
a male, and eighteen years if a female, a married woman, insane, or
imprisoned, every such person shall be entitled to bring such action 
within one year after such disabi!ity i~ removed.
SEC. 6219. If any of the said heirs, next of km, widow, devisees, 
or legatees shall die without having paid his or her just proportion of 
' . 
such debt, his or her executors or administrators shall be liable there-
for, as for his or her proper debt, to the extent to which he or she would 
have been liable if living.
SEC. 6220. If in the case specified in the two preceding sections,
there should be more than one person liable for the debt the creditor 
shall recover the same by one action against all the persons so liable,
or as many of them as are within the reach of process; and the court 
shall thereupon determine, by the verdict of a jury if either party re-
quire it, what sum, if any, is due to the plaintiff; and they shall also
decide, according to the equities of the case, how much each of the
defendants is liable to pay toward the satisfaction of the debt. and ren- 
der judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 6221. If any one of the heirs, devisecs, or others who were
original~y liable for the debt, shall be insolvent, or unable to pay his 
proportion thereof, or shall be beyond the reach of process, the others
shall, nevertheless, be liable to the creditor for the whole amount of
his debt: provided, that no one shaU be compelled to pay more than
the amount received by him from the estate of the deceased. 
SEC. 6222. No suit shall be dismissed or debarred for the want
of including, as defendants, all the persons who might have been
included; but in any stage of the cause the court may award proper 
process to bring in any other parties, and may allow such amendments
as may be necessary to charge them, as defendants, upon such terms as 
the court shall think reasonable.
SEC. 6223. If, in consequence of insolvency, absence, or from
any other cause any one of the persons liahle for such debt shall fail 
' ' . 
' 
to pay his just proportion thereof to the creditor, he shall be liable to
indemnify all who shall, by reason of such failure on his part, have
paid more than their just proportion of the debt=-such indemnity to
be recovered by all of them jointly, or in separate actions by any one
or more of them, for his or their parts respectively, at their election. 

SEC. 6224. When it shall appear to the court, from the represen­
tation of an execu~or or administrat?r, th_at. the real and personal estat_e 
of the deceased will, probably, be insufficient for the payment of his
d b h · f h · k fi · fi 
e ts, t e court may, 1 tt t m s t, appomt two or more t persons to
be commissioners to receive and examine all claims of creditors against
the estate of the deceased, and return to the court a list of all the
claims that shall have been laid before them, with the sum that they
shall have allowed on each claim; and the commissioners, before enter­
ing on the duties of their office, shall be sworn to the faithful discharge 
thereof. 
SEc. 6225. The comrmssroners of msolvency shall appomt con-
venient times and places for their meetings, to receive and examine 
the claims of creditors; and shall give notice thereof, by causing noti-
fications to be posted up in some public places in the township in 
which the deceased last dwelt, or in such other manner as the court
aforesaid having regard to situation of the creditors of the estate. 
may order. 
SEC. 6226. The period of six months, after the appointment of
the commissioners, shall be allowed to the creditors to present and prove 
their claims; and the court may allow such further time for this purpose,
not to exceed eighteen months from the date of the commission, as
they may think necessary, according to the circumstances of the case;
and, at the expiration of the time for the proof of debts, the commis- 
sioners shall make their written report to the court. 
SEC. 6227. If, at the return of the list of claims against the estate,
made out by the commissioners as herein before provided, or made out 
by the executor or administrator, as hereinafter provided, any person
shall be liable as a surety, for the deceased, or shall have any other con­
tingent claim against his estate, which could not be proved as a debt
under the commission, upon the presentation and proof thereof before
the court, the court shall, in ordering a dividend, leave in the hands of
the executor or administrator, a sum sufficient to pay to such contin­
gent creditor, a proportion equal to what shall then be paid to the other 
creditors.
6228. If, at any time within four years after the date of the
administration bond, such contingent debt shall become absolute, it may 
be allowed by the court, if not disputed by the executor or administra­
tor; and, if disputed, may be proved before the commissioners already
appointed, or others to be appointed by the court, in like manner as
if presented before the first return of the list of claims against the
estate. 
SEC. 6229. Upon the allowance of such claim, the creditor shall
be entitle.I to a dividend thereon, equal to what shall have been paid 
to other creditors so far as the same can be paid without disturbing
the former dividend ; and if his claim shall not be finally established, 
or if the dividend due to him shall not exhaust the assets in the hands
of the. executor· or administrator, the residue of the assets shall be
divided among all the creditors who shall have proved their debts. 

SEc. 6230. Any person whose claim shall be disallowed, in whole 
or in part, by the commissioners, and any executor or administrator
who shall be dissatisfied with the allowance of any claim, may appeal 
from the decision of the commissioners to the probate court· if the 
, . . ' 
creditor appeals he shall, within ten days after. the decision, file with
the commissioners a bond to the executor or administrator, with surety 
to be approved by the commissioners, in the sum of one hundred dol-
lars, conditioned to pay all costs that may be adjudged against him on 
such appeal; the executor or administrator may appeal by giving notice 
to the commissioners within ten days; and in case of an appeal, the
court shall, as soon as practicable, hear and determine the question as
to the allowance or disallowance of the claim, and shall adjudge the
costs against the party failing on such hearing. 
SEC. 6231. Any person whose claim shall be disallowed by the
commissioners, and who shall, by accident, mistake, or otherwise, and
not by his own neglect, omit to claim or prosecute his appeal, as before 
id d hi · · d · h f h
provi e , may, upon as pennon, an notice t ereo to t e executor or 
administrator, be allowed by the court to claim and prosecute his
appeal in manner aforesaid, upon such terms as the court shall impose,
if it shall appear by affidavit that justice requires a further examina-
tion of his claim: provided, no such petition shall be sustained, unless
it be presented within two years after the return of the commissioners,
and within four years after the date of the administration bond, and
before final distribution. 
SEC. 6232. The allowance of such appeal, and the judgment that
may follow thereon, shall. not disturb any distribution that may have
been ordered before notice of the petition, or notice of the intention
to present the same, shall have been given to the executor or adminis- 
trator; but the debts, if any, proved and allowed in the case last men-
tioned shall be paid only out of such assets as may remain in or come 
to the hands of the executor or administrator after payment of the sums
due on such prior order of distribution. 
SEc. 6233. The commissioners may, when they think it proper,
require an oath to be administered to any claimant; and they may
thereupon examine him upon all matters relating to his claim; and if 
he shall refuse to take such oath, or to answer fully to all questions that
shall be lawfully put to him, the commissioners may disallow his claim,
and on any appeal from the award of the commissioners, the court shall
have the like power to examine the claimant on oath, and to disallow
his claim, if he shall refuse to take the oath, or to answer fully upon
his examination thereon.
SEC. 6234. Any one of the commissioners may administer the
id h h l · d I d · · h h 11 · 
sat oat tot e c aimant, an may a so a mimster t e oat to a wit-
nesses produced and examined before the commissioners. 
SEC. 6235. After the expiration of thirty days from the return made 
by the commissioners, the court shall make such an order for the dis-
tribution of the effects among the creditors as the case shall require; 
and if, before making such order, the court shall have notice of an
appeal from the commissioners, then made or pending, they may sus-
pend the order until the determination of such appeal, or they may
order a distribution among the creditors whose debts are allowed, leav- 
ing in the hands of the executor or administrator a sum sufficient to
pay the claimant whose demand is disputed, a proportion equal to what
shall be paid to the other creditors. 
SEc. 6236. If the court shall not think fit to appoint commis-
sioners, as herein before provided, when satisfied that the estate will 
probably be insolvent, the executor or administrator shall proceed, in
the place of such commissioners, to receive and allow, if valid, the 
claims of creditors against the estate, and return to the court a list of
all the claims that shall have been laid before him, with the sum allowed
by him on each claim. 
SEC. 6237. The executor or administrator shall, in such case.
immediately after the court shall declare the estate probably insolvent 
 .  .  ' 
give nonce to creditors of the insolvency of the estate, and to present
their claims to him, for allowance, within six months, by causing notifi­
cations to be posted up in some public places in the township in which
the deceased last dwelt, or in such other manner as the court aforesaid,
having regard to the situation of the creditors of the estate, may order. 

SEc. 6238. The notice mentioned in the preceding section may be

further time may be allowed therefor, in like manner as when commis­
sioners are appointed to receive and audit claims; and the executor or
administrator, after the expiration of the said period, shall file the list 
of the claims hereinbefore mentioned. 
SEC. 6240. If any claim, so presented to the executor or adminis- 
trator to be allowed bv him shall be disallowed in whole or in part it 
J   s  ' 
may be referred to referees, by the agreement of the parties, and m the
manner heretofore herein prescribed.
SEC. 6241. If such claim is not referred by the agreement of the
parties, the creditor shall commence a suit thereon, within three months 
after such disallowance, or within three months after the same, or any
part thereof, shall have become due, for the recovery thereof; and if
no suit is commenced within the: time aforesaid, the said claim shall be 
forever barred. 
SEC. 6242. In any suit or proceeding upon any claim mentioned
in the preceding section, the referees or court. before whom the same 
shall be tried, may direct such costs to be awarded against the creditor,
or against the executor or administrator, personally, or to be paid out
of the assets of the estate, as a part of the costs of administration, as
shall be just, having reference to the facts that appeared on the trial.

SEC. 6243. The judgment on the award, or in the suit upon the
claim mentioned in the preceding section, shall he rendered in the same 
manner, and with the same effect, as is provided in the case of an ap-
peal from the award of commissioners. 
SEC. 6244. The court shall. after the expiration of thirty days from
the return hy the executors or administrators of the list of debts, make
an order of distribution. as provided in the case of the return of the 
commissioners, except that the court may, if it thinks fit, first hear and
determine any exceptions that may be filed by any person interested,
against the allowance of any debts which have been allowed by the
executor or administrator, and the court may make an order in relation
to any suit pending against an executor or administrator, in like manner
as is provided when an appeal is had, or pending, before or at the time
an order of distribution is required, upon the report of commissioners.

SEC. 6245. It the whole assets should not have been distributed
upon the first order of distribution, or if furth~r _assets should afterward 
come to the hands of the executor or administrator, the court shall
make such further order or orders for the distribution thereof, as the 
case may require. 
SEC. 6246. No action shall be brought against an executor or ad-
ministrator after the estate is represented insolvent, unless it be for a 
demand that is entitled to a preference, and would not be affected by
the insolvency of the estate, or unless the assets should prove more
than sufficient to pay all the debts allowed by the commissioners, or un-
less a claim is presented and rejected, or disputed by the executor or 
administrator, before the estate is represented as insolvent, or unless
the suit is brought against the executor or administrator, while acting
in the place of commissioners, upon an estate represented to he in-
solvent, and upon a claim disallowed by such executor or administra-
tor; and if an estate is represented insolvent, whilst an action is pending
against an executor or administrator, for any demand that is not entitled
to such preference, the action may be discontinued without the payment
of costs; or, if the demand is disputed, the action may be tried and
determined, and judgment may be rendered thereon, in the same
manner and with the same effect as is provided in the case of an ap-
peal from the award of the commissioners; or the action may be con-
tinued at the discretion of the court, until it shall appear whether the
estate is insolvent, and if it should not prove to be insolvent, the plain-
tiff may prosecute the action as if no such representation had been
made. 
SEC. 6247. Every creditor of an estate that proves to be insolvent,
who shall not have presented his claim for allowance, in the manner
prescribed herein, shall be forever barred from recovering the same, 
unless further assets of the deceased shall come to the hands of the ex-
ecutor or administrator, after the order of distribution, in which case,
his daim may be proved, allowed. and paid, in the manner and with
the limitations herein provided for the case of contingent debts. 

SEC. 6248. If, after the report of the commissioners of insolvency,
or of the executor or administrator acting in their place, the assets 
ffi
. 
shall prove to be SU cient to pay all the debts allowed under the com-
mission, or under the report of the executor or administrator, as the 
case may be, the executor or administrator shall pay the same in full;
and if, after such order is made, any other debts shall afterward be re-
covered against him, he shall be liable therefor only to the extent of
the assets then remaining in his hands. 
SEC. 6249. If there be two or more such creditors, the assets, if
not su.fficient to_ pay their demands in f~ll, shall ~e divided among 
them, m proportion to the amount of their respective debts.
SEC. 6250. The executor or administrator shall, in such case, be
permitted to prove the amount of the assets in his hands, and there· 
. . . 
upon judgment shall he rendered m the usual form: but execution shall 
not issue for more than the amount of such assets; and if there is more
than one judgment, the court shall apportion the amount between them. 

SEC. 6251. If it shall not be ascertained, at the end of three years
after the granting of letters testamentary, or of administration, whether
any estate that has been represented insolvent, is, or is not so in fact,
any creditor whose claim shall not have been presented before the
commissioners, or to the executor or administrator who may be acting
in the place of commissioners, may commence an action therefor,
against the executor or administrator; and such action may be con­
tinued for the defendant, until it shall appear whether the estate is in­
solvent; and if it should not prove to be so, the plaintiff may prosecute
his action as if no such representation had been made. 

SEc. 6252. If any executor or administrator shaJI neglect to 
render and settle his accounts in court, within six months after the re­
turn made by the commissioners, or by the executor or administrator,
in their place, or after the final liquidation of. the demands of the
creditors, or within such further time as the court may allow to collect
the debts and assets, so as to delay an order of distribution, he may be
compelled to render such account, in the manner herein before directed,
to compel the return of an inventory; and the same proceedings may
be had to attach him, and to discharge him, and the like revocation of
the letters granted to him may be made in case of the party abscond­
ing or concealing himself, so that no order can be personally served,
or of his neglecting to render an account within thirty days after being
committed; and new letters shall be granted with the like effect, and
like remedies on the administration bond, as in those cases. 

SEc. 6253. The court shall allow the commissioners such com­ 
pensation as it may deem reasonable, for their services, which shall be 
paid by the executor or administrator, as a part of the costs of ad­ 
ministration.

SEC. 6255. A guardian may _be appointed to take charge o!11Y 
of the estate of a mmor; and at the time of, or subsequent to, the appomt- 
ment of such guardian to any minor having neither father nor mother, 
or whose father and mother are both unsuitable persons to have the
custody and tuition of such minor, or whose interests will, for any other 
cause, in the opinion of the court, be promoted thereby, the court may 
also appoint a guardian to have the custody and provide for the main- 
tenance and education of such minor: provided, however, that if the 
powers of the person appointed guardian be not limited by the order
of appointment, the person so appointed shall be guardian both of the 
person and estate of the ward; and the court shall in every instance
appoint a guardian both of the person and estate of the ward, unless
the interests of the minor will, in the opinion of the court, be promoted
by the appointment of separate guardians, as hereinafter 
prescribed. 
SEC. 6256. No person who may have been, or shall be, an admin­
istrator on an estate, or executor of a last will and testament, shall be
appointed a guardian of the person and estate, or of the estate only of
any minor who shall be interested in the estate administered upon, or
who shall be entitled to any interest under or by virtue of such last
will and testament; but an executor or administrator may be appointed
a guardian of the person only of any minor. (55 v. 54, § 3.) 
SEc. 6257. Any male infant over the age of fourteen years, or a
female infant over the age of twelve years, shall have the right to select
a ~uardian, who, if a suitable person, shall be appointed; but if such
mmor shall fail to select a suitable person, an appointment may be
made without reference to the wishes of such minor: A minor shall
not, in any instance, have the right to select one person to be the
guardian of his or her estate only and another person to be guardian
of his or her person only, unless the court having the power of appoint­
ment shall be of opinion that the interests of such minor will be pro­
moted by the choice and appointment of such separate guardians. 
instead of one guardian, both of the person and estate. 
SEC. 6258. When a guardian has been appointed for any minor
before he or she shall have attained the age for making a selection, as 
fixed in the last preceding section, the powers of such guardian shall
continue until the ward shall arrive at the age of majority, unless such
guardian be sooner removed for good cause, or such ward shall select
another suitable guardian : After such selection is made and approved
by the court, and the person so selected is duly appointed and qualified,
the powers of the guardian previously appointed shall cease, and there-
upon the final account of such guardian shall be filed and settled in 
the proper court.
SEC. 6259. Before any person shall be appointed guardian of the
person and estate, or of the estate only, of any minor, he shall file in
the office of the court having such appointment to make, a statement
of the whole estate of said minor, and the probable value thereof, and
also the probable annual rents of such minor's real estate, and shall
verify the same by affidavit, and shall give bond, with freehold sureties,
resident of the state, one of whom shall be resident of the county
where such guardian is appointed, payable to the state, in double the
amount of the personal estate belonging to said minor, and also of the
gross amount of rents that will be probably received by the guardian
from the real estate of said minor during his or her minority : pro­
vided, that in lieu of freehold surety, such person may execute to said 
minor a mortgage upon good and unincumbered real estate, first fur-
nishing to said probate court an abstract of his title thereto, which shall
by affidavits duly filed be shown to be in value, exclusive of all improve-
ments thereon, sufficient to secure said bond to the satisfaction of said
probate court, which mortgage shall be duly recorded in the county in
which such real estate is situate, and filed with such probate court;
which bnnd shall be conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties
of said person, as such guardian, and shall be approved by the court 
making such appointment; and such person shall also take an oath
that he will faithfully and honestly discharge the duties devolving upon
him as such guardian. 
SEC. 6260. Before a person is appointed guardian to have the cus-
tody, maintenance, and tuition of a minor, without the right to take 
charge of the estate of such minor, he shall give bond in double the
probable expenses of maintaining and educating such minor during one
year: in all other respects his bond shall be the same as if he had
charge of the estate of his ward, and he shall take the same oath as is 
prescribed in the preceding section.
SEC. 6261. Exceptions may be fi ed in the proper court, by any
person on behalf of any minor for whom a guardian has been or may 
be appointed, to the bond of such guardian, as to the sufficiency of the
amount of the penalty thereof, or the sureties therein; whereupon
notice shall be given to such guardian to appear before said court within
a reasonable time, not exceeding ten days, and show cause against the
allowance of the exceptions; and upon the hearing of such exceptions,
the court may dismiss the same, or require such guardian to find addi-
tional sureties or security in a larger amount, or make such other order
as the case may require; and it shall be the duty of the court by which
any guardian is appointed, to require, of its own motion, such guardian
to give additional bond whenever, in the opinion of said court, the
interests of the ward of such guardian shall demand the same. 

SEc. 6262. No bond executed by a guardian shall be void, or held
invalid on account of any informality in the same, nor on account of 
any informality or illegality in the appointment of such guardian; but
such bond shall have the same force and effect as if such appointment
had been legally made and such bond executed in proper form. 
SEc. 6263. When the same person shall be appointed guardian of
several minors, being children of the same parentage and inheriting 
from the same estate, separate bonds shall not be required; and in such
cases only one application shall be required, and the letters of guar-
dianship to be issued to such guardian by the court shall be in one copy,
and not one for each minor; and the court approving and recording
such bond, and issuing such letters, shall charge such fees as are
allowed by law for such services, to be charged but once, and not once
for each ward of such guardian. 
SEc. 6264. Every person appointed guardian both of the person
and estate of a minor, shall have the custody and tuition of his ward, 
and the management of such ward's estate during minority, unless
sooner removed or discharged from such trust, or the guardianship shall 
sooner determine from any of the causes specified in this chapter: pro·
vided, that the father of such minor, or if there be no father, the
mother, if suitable person, respectively, shall have the custody of the
person and the control of the education of such minor. 

SEc. 6265. The marriage of a ward, if a female, shall determine
the guardianship as to the person, but not as to the estate of such ward. 

SEC. 6266. Any father, or in case the father be dead or have gone
to parts unknown, any mother may, by last will in writing, appoint a
guardian or guardians, for any of his or her children, whether born at
the time of making the will, or afterward, to continue during the minor· 
ity of the child, or for a less rime. 
SEC. 6267. When a guardian ias been appointed by will, by a
father or mother of any child, such guardian shall he entitled to prefer·
ence in appointment over all others, without reference to his place of
residence, or the choice of such minor, but his appointment, duties,
powers, and liabilities shall in all other respects he governed by the law
regulating guardians not appointed by will, except as otherwise specially 
provided. 
SEc. 6268. Every such testamentary guardian shaJI give bond. in
like manner and with like conditions, as is required of a guardian
appointed by the probate court: provided, that when the testator,
in the will appointing the guardian, shall have ordered or requested that
such bond should not be given, the bond shall not be required, unless,
from a change in the situation or circumstances of the guardian, or for
other sufficient cause, the court of probate shall think proper to require 
it. 
SEC. 6269. The following shall be the duties of every guardian of 
any minor who may be appointed to have the custody of such minor
and take charge of the estate of such minor, to-wit: 
First-To make out and file within three months after his appoint·
ment, a full inventory, verified by oath, of the real and personal estate
of his ward, with the value of the same, and the value of the yearly
rent of the real estate; and failing so to do for thirty days after he shall
have been notified of the expiration of the time by the probate judge,
said probate judge shall remove him, and appoint a successor. 
Second-To manage the estate for the best interests of his ward.
Third-To render on oath to the proper court an account of the 
receipts and expenditures of such guardian, verified by vouchers or
proof, once in every two years, or oftener, upon the order of the court,
made upon motion of any person interested in said ward or the prop­
erty of such ward, for good cause shown by affidavit, and failing so tu
do for thirty days after he shall have been notified of the expiration of
the time by the probate judge, he shall receive nu allowance for services,
unless the court shall enter upon its journal that such delay was neces­
sary and reasonable: provided, that in all cases where the whole estate
of said ward or of several wards jointly, under the same appointment
of guardianship, shall not exceed two hundred dollars in value, said 
guardian shall only be required to render such account upon the termi­
nation of said guardianship, or upon the order of said court, made upon
its own motion or the motion of some person interested in said ward or
wards, or in his, her, or their property, for good cause shown, and set
forth upon the journal of said court. · 
Fourth-At the expiration of his trust, fully to account for and pay
over to the proper person all of the estate of his ward remaining in his 
hands.
Fifth-To pay all just debts due from such ward, out of the estate in 
his hands, and collect all debts due such ward, and in case of doubtful
debts to compound the same, and appear for and def end, or cause to 
be def ended, all suits against such ward.
Sixth-When any ward has no father or mother, or having a father 
or mother, and such parent is unable or fails to educate such ward, it
shall be the duty of his guardian to provide for him such education as
the amount of his estate may justify. 
Seventh-To loan or invest the money of his ward within a reasona­
ble time after he receives it, in notes or bonds secured by first mortgage
on real estate of at least double the value of the money loaned or
invested, exclusive of improvements, timber, or minerals subject to
destruction, or exhaustion; in bonds of the United States or of any
state on which default has never been made in payment of interest,
or bonds of any county or city in this state issued in conformity to
law; or, with the consent and approbation of the probate court, in pro­
ductive real estate within this state, the title to which shall be taken in
the name of the guardian as such; and to manage such investments,
and when deemed proper change the same into any other investments
of the above classes; but no real estate so purchased shall be sold by
the guardian except with the consent and approbation of the probate
court; and if said guardian fail to loan or invest the money of his
ward within such reasonable time, he shall account on settlement for
such money and interest thereon, calculated with annual rests. 
Eighth-To obey and perform all the orders and judgments of the
proper courts touching the guardianship. (69 v. SS, § 14.] 
SEC. 6270. When a guardian is appointed to take charge only of
the estate of a minor, his duties shall be the same as those specified in 
the preceding section, except that he shall not he required to perform
the sixth duty therein mentioned when a guardian of the person of 
such minor has been appointed. 
SEC. 6271. When a guardian is appointed to have the custody,
maintenance, and education of a minor, his duties shall be as follows:
First-To protect and control the person of his ward. Second-To 
provide a suitable maintenance for his ward, when necessary, which
shall he paid out of the estate of such ward in the hands of the guar­
dian of such estate, upon the or<ler of the guardian of the person of
such ward. Third-When such ward has no father or mother. or hav­
ing a father or mother, and such parent is unable or fails to maintain or
educate such ward, it shall be the duty of the guardian so appointed lo 
provide for him such maintenance and education as the amount of his
estate may justify, which shall be paid out of the estate of such ward
in the hands of the gu irdian of such estate. upon the order of the
guardian of the person of such ward. Fourth-To obey and perform
all the orders and judgments of the court touching the guardianship. 
SEC. 6272. The probate court may at any time remove any guar-
dian, he having thirty days' notice thereof, for habitual drunkenness,
neglect of his duties, incompetency, fraudulent conduct, removal from
the county, or any other cause which, in the opinion of such court, ren­
ders it for the interest of the ward that such guardian be removed ; the
removal from the state of any person who h~s been heretofore or who 
mav he hereafter appointed guardian, shall of itself determine the
guardianship of such person. 
SEC. 6273. Any surety of a guardian may, at any time, apply to the
proper probate court to he released from his bond of such guardian, by
filing his request therefor with the judge of such court, and giving ten
days' notice to such guardian, when application will be made to such
court to release such surety; and if such guardian fail to gi\'e new bond,
as by such court directed, he shall be removed and his letters super­
seded, but such original surety shall not be released until such guardian
so gives bonds, and such original surety shall be liable only for the acts 
of such guardian from the time of the execution of the original bond
to the filing and approval by the court of such new bond. 
SEc. 6274. The court by which any guardian has been or may be
appointed, may, for reasons satisfactory to such court, accept the resig­
nation of any such guardian and appoint another in his stead. (55 v. 
SEC. 6275. It shall be the duty of the court by which any guar-
dian has been or may he appointed to enforce the return, at the pre­
scribed times, of all inventories and accounts required to be filed in
such court by such guardian, and also to enforce the performance of
all other duties devolving upon guardians appointed by such court,
either with or without complaint being first made. and thereupon to
make and enter such judgments and orders as may be requisite in any
case to promote the faithful and correct discharge of the duties of such
guardians, or to preserve the estate of minors for whom such guardians 
may have been or shall be appointed. 
SEC. 6276. When a minor, for whom a guardian has been
appointed in this state, shall remove to another state or territory. and a
guardian of such infant shall be there appointed, the guardian appointed
in this state may be removed, and required to settle his account as 
hereinafter provided. 
SEC. 6277. Such removal shall not he made unless the guardian
appointed in another state or territory shall apply to the probate court
in this state which made the former appointment, and file therein an 
exemplification from the record of the court making the foreign appoint-

ment.' contammg a. t. e. entries an. procee mgs In re anon to IS 
appointment, and his g1vmg bond, with a copy thereof and of the let-
ters of guardianship, all authenticated as required by the act of con- 
gress in that behalf: and before such application shall be heard. or any
action taken therein by the court, at least thirty days' written notice
shall be served on the guardian appointed in this state, specifying the
object of the application and the time when the same will be heard:
provided, no such removal shall be made in favor of any foreign guard-
ian, unless at the time of the hearing the state or territory in which he 
was appointed has made a similar provision as to wards removing from
such state or territory; and provided, further, that the court may, in any

to be sold, or any part thereof, shall be laid out in town lots, that fact
shall be stated and the reasons therefor, and the manner in which the
Same is to be laid OUl. 
SEc. 6282. Upon such petition being filed, verified by the oath
of the guardian, the court shall order the petitioner to give notice to
his ward, who shall be defendant to the petition, of the filing and
demand thereof, and the time when the same will he heard, in such
manner as to the court shall seem reasonable and proper. 
SEC. 6283. At the time appointed for the hearing of said petition,
and being satisfied that the notice named in the last preceding section
has been given, and that such real estate ought to be sold, the court
shall appoint three freeholders of the county in which said real estate
shall be situated, who are not of kin to the petitioner, to appraise said
real estate; and if such petition seeks to have the land or any part
thereof laid out into town lots, and the court finds that it will be to the
advantage of the ward to have the same done, the court shall also
authorize the survey and platting of the land for that purpose. 

SEC. 6284. Said appraisers shall take an oath to truly and impar­ 
tially appraise said real estate at the fair cash value, which oath shall be
indorsed on the certificate of their appointment, or order of sale issued 
by the court. 
SEc. 6285. Upon the appraisement of said real estate being filed, 
signed by said appraisers, the court shall require such guardian to exe­
cute a bond, with sufficient freehold sureties, payable to the state in
double the appraised value of such real estate, with condition for the
faithful discharge of his duties, and the faithful payment, and account­
ing for, of all moneys arising from such sale according to law. 

SEC. 6286. Upon such bond being filed and approved by the
court, it shall order the sale of such real estate, at auction, for not less
than two-thirds of the appraised value thereof, providing in the order
for reasonable notice and the place of such sale in the county in which
such real estate shall lie; and the credit to be given for the payment
of the purchase money, and the deferred payments of the purchase
money shall be secured by a mortgage executed by the purchaser on
the real estate sold, and they shall bear interest at the legal rate per
annum from the day of sale, payable annually: provided, however, that
if it is made to appear to such probate court that it will be more for the
interest of said ward to sell such real estate at private sale, it may
authorize said guardian to sell the same at private sale, either in whole
or in parcels, and upon such terms of payment as may be prescribed by
the court; and in no case shall such real estate be sold at private sale
for less than the appraised value thereof; and if the petition includes
an application for the laying out into town lots of the land to be sold,
or any part thereof, and the court approve the survey and plat made for 
that purpose, the court shall also authorize the guardian, on behalf of
his ward, to sign, seal, and acknowledge the plat in that behalf for record 
according to law.
SEC. 6287. Upon the return of the order of sale issued by the
court, such guardian shall make report of the sale by him made; where-

securing the deferred payments of the purchase money in the manner
prescribed in the last preceding section. 
SEc. 6288. Every guardian shall be allowed, by the court settling
his account, the amount of all his reasonable expenses incurred in the 
execution of his trust; and also such compensation for his services as
the court shall deem reasonable. 
SEC. 6289. The settlement made in the probate court of the ac-
counts of a guardian shall be final between him and his ward, unless 
an appeal he taken therefrom to the court of common pleas in the man-
ner provided by law; saving, however, to any such ward the right of
opening and reviewing such settlement, for fraud or manifest mistake,
by civil action in the court of common pleas of the county in which 
such settlement was made, or the county where such guardian may
reside when the petition is filed, at the option of the plaintiff in such 
action, at any time within two years after the said ward shall arrive at
full age. 
SEC. 6290. Minors living out of this state and owning lands within

minors residing out of this state, who have been appointed according
to the laws of the state or territory where they may reside, shall have 
the right to bring and maintain actions and enforce the collection of
judgments, rendered in such cases in their favor, in the same manner
and to the same extent that they could do if they had been appointed
under the laws of this state, upon giving security for the costs which
may accrue in such actions, in the same way other non-residents are 
obliged to do under the Jaws of this state. All applications for the sale
of real estate by guardians of minors who live out of this state shall be 
made in the county in which the land is situate; or, if situate in more
counties than one, then in one of the counties in which a part of such
real estate is situate; and additional security shall be required from
such guardian ~r guardians, when deemed necessary, and such as may 
be approved by the probate court of the county in which such applica­
tion is made. 
SEc. 6291. When any guardian has died, or may hereafter die,
before the settlement in court of his or her guardianship account, it 
shall be the duty of the executor or administrator of such guardian to
settle said account, in the same manner such guardian ought to have
done; and any person having an interest in the settlement of such
account, or the court by which such guardian was appointed, of its own
motion, may, by citation to be issued, returned, and proceeded upon 
according to the provisions of law which may then be in force for the
settlement of decedent's estates, compel such settlement to be made by
the administrator or executor of any guardian dying or having died, as
aforesaid: the executor or administrator making such settlement shall 
be allowed such compensation for the same as the court with which the
settlement is made shall deem reasonable. 
SEC. 6292. When any unmarried woman, who has been or may
be appointed guardian of any minor, shall marry, such marriage shall 
of itself determine the guardianship of such woman; and the probate
court of the proper county shall appoint another guardian for such 
minor, to which last named guardian all the estate of such minor shall,
on demand, be delivered up by such former guardian; and she shall 
forthwith render her guardianship account for final settlement. 

SEC. 6293. The guardian of a female under twelve years of age
or a male under fourteen years of age, may, if it be necessary, bind 
such minor to any suitable person. until such minor shall arrive at the
age of twenty-one if a male or eighteen if a female, or for a shorter
period; but no such indenture shall be executed unless the probate
court appointing such guardian shall first approve such binding and the
terms and conditions of the indentures, and evidence such approval by
a certificate under the seal of the court indorsed upon the indentures. 
SEC. 6294. When any minor has title to any real estate by tax title
only, the guardian of such minor may, if he deem it advisable, by deed
of release and quit claim convey such minor's interest or title to the 
person entitled to redeem such real estate, upon receiving from such
person the full amount paid for such tax title with the penalty and in­
terest allowed by law in that behalf; and if any such guardian shall
tender such deed to the person so entitled to redeem such real estate, 
and such person shall refuse to accept the same and pay as aforesaid,
such person in any proceeding thereafter instituted to redeem or recover 
such real estate shall not recover costs. 
SEC. 6295. A guardian of the person and estate, or of the estate
only, of any minor may lease the real estate of his ward for any term 
not exceeding three years and not extending beyond the minority.

SEC. 6296. Such guardian may also lease the real estate of his
ward for any term not exceeding fifteen years, although such term ex- 
tend beyond the minority, whenever the court appointing him shall, on
his application. find that such lease will be to the advantage of the
ward, and is necessary to secure the improvement of the real estate 
and to increase its rents, and that such increase is needed for the sup­
port and education of his ward or to pay his liabilities or any liens on,
or claims against his estate. and that by such lease a sale of real estate 
for these purposes may be prevented. 
SEC. 6297. Such application shall be by petition, whid1 shall con­
tain a description of the real estate and a particular. statement of its 
value and the value of all other property or effects of the ward, and his
income and expenses, a detailed statement of the improvements pro- 
posed and the liabilities or expense of support and education to he pro-
vided for, the rent of the real estate as it is, and the probable increase 
of rent if the improvements are made, the means intended to be used

the real estate, and the same rules shall apply as to parties and notice 
as in application for sale of real estate; and on the hearing the court
shall appoint three disinterested freeholders of the county in which the
real estate is situate, who are not of kin to the petitioner. to view the
premises and report under oath their opinion of the probable cost of
the improvements proposed, whether the same and the proposed lease
would be for the best interest of the ward or wards, and if so, upon
what terms the lease should be made, and the report shall be returned
on or before a day named in the order for the final hearing of the case. 

SEC. 6299. On the final hearing, if the report of the freeholders
be in favor of the lease, and the court be of opinion that it will be to 
the advantage of the ward or wards to improve and lease the real
estate, and that such lease is necessary to secure the improvements and
increase the rents, and that such increase is needed for the support and
education of the ward or wards, or to pay his or their liabilities or liens
or other claims against his or their estate, and that by such lease a sale
of real estate for any of these purposes may be prevented, the court
shall make an order authorizing the lease to be made on such terms
and in such manner as the court shall think proper. 
SEC. 6300. In the lease made in pursuance of such order, it may
be provided that the improv~men~s shall be made by the tenant as part
of the rent, or by the guardian, either out of the rent or· other means 
of the ward or wards, as the court may have directed. 

SEC. 6301. Any lease made by a guardian to extend beyond the
minority shall nevertheless determine when the ward if there be but 
 ' . ' ' . 
one, arrives at full age, or if more than one, when all of them arrive at
full age, unless such ward or wards then confirm the same; and in case
of the death of the ward, if there be but one, or of all of them, if
more than one, the lease shall also determine, unless the legal representa-
tives of such ward or wards confirm the same; if there be more than.
one ward, and some but not all die, the lease shall continue till the survivor

or survivors reach full age; and when such lease is determined
by reason of the death or majority of the ward or wards, the tenant
shall have a lien on the premises for any sum or sums expended by him 
in pursuance of the lease in making improvements and for which com-
pensation shall not have been made, either by the rent or otherwise. 

SEC. 6302. The probate court, upon satisfactory proof that any
person resident of the county, or having a legal settlement in any town-
ship thereof, is an idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, shall appoint a guardian
for such person, which guardian shall, by virtue of such appointment, 
be the guardian of the minor children of his ~ard, unless the court
shall appoint some other person as their guardian; an imbecile shall, in
this chapter, be understood to mean a person who, not born idiotic, has 
become so.
SEC. 6303. When any person having a wife shall be declared to be
an idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, it shall be lawful for the probate judge to 
appoint the wife of such person his guardian, if it be made to appear
to the satisfaction of the judge that she is competent to discharge the
duties of such appointment, and any married woman appointed such
guardian shall, in her said capacity, have power to enter into official
bonds, and she and her sureties thereon shall be liable in the same man­ 
ner, and to the same extent as though said bond was executed by a
femme sole.
SEC. 6304. All laws relating to guardians for minors and their
wards, and all laws pointing out the duties, rights, and liabilities of such 
guardians and their sureties, in force for the time being, shall be appli-

except as otherwise specially provided; but in the settlement of the
accounts of such guardians, no voucher shall be received from or allowed
as a credit to the guardian of any idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, which shall 
be signed or purport to be signed by such idiot, imbecile, or lunatic;
and provided, that any settlement of the account of any such guardian 
heretofore made, in which any such receipt shall have been allowed as
credit to such guardian, shall be held and deemed absolutely null and
void, and any settlement made by any such guardian shall, at any time
within two years after the appointment of another guardian, or after the
disability of such ward may be removed, or such ward may die, be
opened up and reviewed, on the motion of such newly appointed guard­
ian, or legal representative, or of any other interested person, notice
of which motion shall be given by publication or otherwise as the probate
judge may direct. 
SEC. 6305. Such guardian may sue in his own name, describing
himself as guardian of the ward for whom he sues, and when his 
guardianship s la 1 cease, y his death, removal, or otherwise. or y t e 
decease of his ward, any suit, action, or proceeding then pending shall
not abate, if the right survive, but his successor as guardian, or such
idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, if he be restored to his reason, or the execu­
tor or administrator of such idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, as the case may
require, shall be made party to the suit or other proceeding, in like
mauner as is or may be provided by law for making an executor or
administrator party to a suit or proceeding of a like kind, where the 
plaintiff dies during its pendency.
SEc. 6306. Whenever the sale of the real estate of such ward is 
necessary for his support, or the support of his family, or the payment
of his debts, or such sale will be for the interest of such ward, or his 
children, the guardian may sell the same under like proceedings as are
or may be required by law to authorize the sale of real estate by the
guardian of a minor, or if it be more for the interest of such idiot,
imbecile, or lunatic, or his children, the probate court, upon the petition
of the guardian, may authorize him to sell said real estate at private sale,
either in whole or in parcels, and upon such terms of payment as shall be
prescribed by the court: Said petition shall contain a pertinent descrip­
tion of the real estate proposed to be sold, a statement of its value as
nearly as can be ascertained, and the facts on which the application is
founded, and if, upon hearing, the court shall be satisfied that it will be
more for the interest of the ward that said real estate should be sold at
private than at public sale, the court may make an order authorizing 
said sale, and prescribing the terms thereof, first taking from said guard­
ian a sufficient bond for the faithful performance of his duty in the
premises, and for accounting for the proceeds of all sales made under
said order: provided, however, that the guardian shall not be author­
ized to sell the real estate at private sale for less than its full ·appraised
value; and if the ward have a wife she shall be made a defendant to 
the petition, and if she file her answer consenting to the sale free and

shall, on the sale being confirmed, be a full release of her expectancy
of dower, and unless in such answer she waive any allowance in lieu
of dower, the court shall allow her out of the proceeds of the sale such
sum in money as is the just and reasonable value of her expectancy 
of dower. 
SEC. 6307. The guardian of any idiotic, imbecile, or msane widow,
who has or is supposed to have a right of dower in any lands or tene- 
ments, of which her husband was seized as an estate of inheritance, or
in any land held by bond, article, or other evidence of claim, where the 
dower has not been assigned, shall have power to sell, compromise, or
adjust the same upon such terms as he shall deem for the interest of
such widow, and as the probate court of the county in which the guard-
ian was appointed shall approve; and after such approval, the guardian
may execute and deliver all needful deeds, releases, and agreements for
the sale, compromise, or assignment of such dower. 
SEC. 6308. Such guardian may also, in like manner as the guard- 
ian of a minor, and on like proceedings, be authorized to lease and
irnprove the real estate of his ward; and if the lease extend beyond 
the time of the restoration of such ward to sound mind, or his death,
such lease shall determine on his restoration or death, unless the same
be confirmed by such ward or his legal representatives; but if such
lease determine by reason of the restoration of the ward or his death,
the tenant shall have a lien on the premises for any sum or sums
expended by him in pursuance of the lease in making improvements
and for which compensation shall not have been made either by the rent 
or otherwise.

family, or that such leasing will be for the best interests of him or 
them; but such guardian may lease the real estate of his ward for any
term not exceeding three years without any application to the court. 

SEC. 6310. The application for authority to make such long lease 
or leases shall be by petition setting forth the character of the idiocy 
imbecility, or lunacy of the ward, whether curable or incurable, tem-
porary or confirmed, and its duration, the number, names, ages, and
residence of the family of the ward, including the wife or husband of
the ward, and of those who have the next estate of inheritance from
said ward, all of whom as well as the ward shall be made defendants;
and the petition shall also contain a description of the real estate, its
value, and the amount for which it can probably be leased, the reasons
for the proposed lease, and the terms, covenants, conditions, and stip­

shall also state in their report their opinion whether the proposed lease
will be to the interests of the ward and his family, and they may also
suggest any change in the terms, covenants, conditions, and stipula­
tions proposed in the petition; and on the' return of the appraisement,
the guardian shall not be required to give an additional bond, but in
case of sale under the terms of the lease, he shall be required to ~i\'e
such bond before the confirmation of the sale.

leasing be allowed for a less rent than that named in the report of the
appraisers, and the lease shall not take effect till the same, with the
security therein, is approved and confirmed. 
SEc. 6313. The guardian of an idiot, imbecile, or lunatic, whether
appointed by a court in this state or elsewhere, may complete the real 
contracts of his ward, or any authorized contract of a guardian who
has died or been removed, in like manner and by like proceedings as
the real contract of a decedent may, under an order of court, be spe­
cifically performed by his executor or administrator; but in all cases
when the guardian, by virtue of such contract or the completion thereof,
shall receive or be entitled to receive any moneys not amply covered hy

SEC. 6324. The said trustee shall, unless removed by the court,
hold his appointment until such minor arrives at the age of majority, 
whether such minor be under twelve or fourteen years of age or not
at the time of such appointment, or until the disability of such idiot,
lunatic, or imbecile shall be removed, or the minor, idiot, imbecile, or 
lunatic die. 
SEC. 6325. All moneys due to such minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbe­
cile, in the hands of such trustee, shall, during the minority of such
minor, or during the disability of such idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, be
paid over to the foreign guardian of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or irnbe-
cile, so far as necessary or proper for his support and maintenance, or
in case of the decease of such minor, or of such idiot, lunatic, or im­
becile, to the administrator or other legal representative of such minor,
idiot, lunatic, or imbecile: provided, that the court which appointed
such trustee shall have satisfactory proof, as hereinafter provided, of
the authority of such guardian, or administrator, or other legal repre­
sentative, to receive the moneys or estates of such minor, idiot, lunatic,
or imbecile, and that the security given by such guardian, or adminis­
trator, or other legal representative, is sufficient to protect the interest
of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, or his or her estate, and shall
moreover deem it best for the minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, or his
or her estate. 
SEC. 6326. When any foreign guardian, administrator, or other
legal representative of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, shall
apply to have all or any of the moneys or property in the hands of such
trustee paid or delivered over to him, he shall file his petition, or
motion, to that effect, in the court by which such trustee was appointed,
giving such trustee thirty days' notice of the time of hearing thereon,
and he shall also produce an exemplification from under the seal of the
office (if there be a seal) of the proper court of the state of his resi­
dence, containing all the entries on record in relation to his appoint­
ment, giving bond, etc., and authenticated as required by the act of
congress in such cases; and upon the hearing thereof, the court shall
make such order, as, under all the circumstances, it shall deem for the
best interests of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, or his or her 
estate. 
SEC. 6327. When any money of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or
imbecile may be in the hands of such trustee, and not likely to be 
needed for the support and education of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or
imbecile, said trustee shall loan the same in the same manner as guard­
ians by the laws of this state are required to loan the moneys of their
wards. 

SEc. 6328. Any trustee of any non-resident idiot, imbecile, or
lunatic, appointed as aforesaid, and any trustee heretofore or hereafter
created by any last will or deed, or appointed by any competent
authority, to execute any trust created by any such last will or deed,
shall, as often as once each two years, render an account of the execu­
tion of his said trust, to the probate court of the county in which he
was appointed, or in which such last will or deed may be recorded, in
the manner provided by law for the settlement of the accounts of execu- 
tors and administrators: provided, this section shall not apply in any
case in which the will or deed creating such trust designates any other
tribunal for the settlement of the trust, or in which any other tribunal
shall have acquired jurisdiction. 
SEC. 6329. The probate court shall issue and have served in the
same manner as is or may be provided by law, in the case of the set- 
tlement of executors and administrators, the necessary citations and
notices by publication or otherwise, requiring all persons interested, to
attend such settlement and make objections thereto, if any they have. 

SEc. 6330. The said court shall have full power to hear and deter-
mine all matters relative to the manner in which the trustee has exe- 
cuted his said trust, and as to the correctness of his accounts rendered
as aforesaid; and to require any trustee, created as aforesaid within such
county, on the determination of his said trust, or on the removal or res-
ignation of such trustee, or in case of the death of the trustee, to require
his executor or administrator to render a final account of the manner
in which he has executed his said trust, and to hear and determine all
matters relating thereto, in the same manner as the accounts of executors
and administrators are required by law to be settled.
SEC. 6331. The determination of the probate court on any such
settlement, whether final or intermediate, may be appealed from in the 
id d 1 f id
manner provt e for an appea rom sar court on the settlement of the 
accounts of executors and administrators, and the like proceedings shall
be had on such appeal, and the result of such proceedings on appeal cer-
tified back to the probate court. 
SEC. 6332. The determination of the probate court on any such
settlement, shall have the same force and effect as the like determination 
as to the account of an administrator or executor: and when an account
is settled in the absence of any person adversely. interested, and with- 
out actual notice to him, the account may be opened on his filing excep-
tions to the account, at any time within eight months thereafter; and
upon any settlement of an account by a trustee, all his former accounts
may be so far opened as to correct any mistake or error therein, except-
ing that any matter of dispute between two parties, which had been
previously heard and determined by the court, shall not be again brought
in question by either of the same parties without leave of the court. 

SEC. 6333. The probate court shall have power to make such
11 
· r h · · d ·
a owance as compensation to trustees tor t err services an 'expenses m 
executing their trusts, as the court may deem just and equitable, not
exceeding the compensation allowed to guardians for like services: and
said judge shall have the same fees as in the settlements of administrators 
and executors. 
SEC. 6334. The probate court may accept the resignation of any
trustee ac~ounting therein or who has accounted therein, or who .has 
been appomted thereby, or may remove any such trustee for any cause
for which the guardian of a minor may be removed or because the 
interests of the trust require his removal.

CHAPTER 4. 
IN~LVENT DEBTORS. 
VOLUNTARY ASSIGNMENTS. 
SEc. 6335. When any person, partnership, association, or corpora­
tion, shall make an assignment to a trustee of any property, money,
rights, or credits, in trust for the benefit of creditors, it shall be the duty
of said assignee. within ten days after the delivery of the assignment
to him, and before disposing of any property so assigned, to appear
before the probate judge of the county in which the assignor resided
at the time of executing the said assignment, produce the original assign­
ment, or a copy thereof, cause the same to be filed in the probate court,
and enter into a bond, payable to the state, in such sum .and with such
sureties as shall be approved by the court, conditioned for the faithful
performance, by said assignee, of his duties according to law; and the
court may require the assignee, or any trustee subsequently appointed,
to execute an additional undertaking whenever the interests of the cred­
itors of the assignor demand the same; any such assignment shall take
effect only from the time of its delivery to the probate judge, and the 
exact time of such delivery shall be indorsed thereon by the probate
judge, who shall immediately note the filing on the journal of the
court; and it may be delivered by the assignor to the probate judge
either before or after its delivery to the assignee. 
SEc. 6336. If any such assignment or a copy thereof shall, for ten
days after the execution of the assignment, not be filed in the probate 
court as aforesaid, or if the assignee named thereon fail for that time to
give bond as aforesaid, the court shall, on the application of the assignor, 
or of any of his creditors, make an order removing such assignee and
appoint a trustee in his place: provided, that if more than one assignee
be named in the assignment, and some of them fail as aforesaid, the
court may permit the assignee or assignees complying with the preced-
ing section to qualify and enter upon the discharge of the duties of 
the trust.
SEc. 6337. Any assignee who has qualified, and any trustee
appointed by the court who has qualified, may, with the consent of the
court, resign his trust; and in case of the death, removal, or resigna- 
tion of a sole assignee or trustee, the court shall appoint one or more
trustees in his place; but if there be one or more assignees or trustees
who have not died, resigned, or been removed, the court may either
fill the vacancy caused by the death, resignation, or removal, or allow
the remaining assignee or assignees, trustee or trustees, to execute the 
trust, as the court may deem best for the trust; and the court may at
any time, on application of a majority of the creditors in amount, 
appoint an additional trustee. 
SEC. 6338. Whenever a petition shall be filed with the court,
signed by creditors of the assignor who own not less than one thousand 
d

. h . d h lidi f h d b . 
o ars o e ts against t e assignor, an t e va 1 tty o sue e ts is
shown by the schedule of debts on file in the court, or otherwise estab- 
lished to the satisfaction of the court, praying for permission to elect a
trustee or trustees, the court shall, by its order, fix a time for such election, 
and cause notices to be sent by mail or otherwise to each of the creditors
of the assignor, specifying the time when the creditors shall meet at
the court-room for the election of a trustee or trustees; and at the time
named, in such order, if creditors representing fifty per cent. or more
of the debts of the assignor are present in person or by attorney, they
may proceed to the election of a trustee or trustees, a majority in value
of all the debts so represented at such meeting being necessary to a
choice; and the proceedings of the meeting showing what creditors
were present as aforesaid, and the amount of the debts held by them
respectively, and who cast their several votes, shall be made out and
signed by the president and secretary of the meeting and filed with
the court ; and if the court approve the choice, and the trustee or
trustees so elected appear within ten days thereafter and give bond, the
court shall appoint him or them as such trustee or trustees, and remove
the preceding assignee or trustee: provided, that the summary deter-
mination of the court as to who are creditors and the amount of their
claims in this section provided, shall have no effect as to the validity
of such claims, except for the purpose of such election.
SEc. 6339. The court may remove any assignee or trustee, speci- 
f ying in the order the cause of removal; and on application made by
any surety or sureties of any assignee or trustee, the court may, if sat­
isfied of the reasonableness of the application, require such assignee
or trustee to give a new bond, or on failure so to do, the court shall
remove such assignee or trustee; and upon a new bond being given in
accordance with such order and approved by the court, the sureties in
the original bond shall be by the order of the court discharged from
further liability.
SEc. 6340. Whenever the probate court appoints a trustee whether
in place of an assignee, or of a trustee before appointed by the court,
such trustee shall, within ten days after his appointment, give bond as
aforesaid, or, failing so to do, he may he considered as declining the
appointment, and the place may be filled by the court; and when a
trustee shall have given bond, he shall succeed to all the rights, powers,
and privileges of the preceding assignee or trustee; and the court may
make and enforce all orders necessary to put the newly appointed
trustee into possession of all property, moneys, books, papers, evi­
dences of title, and other effects covered by the assignment, or in any
way belonging to the trust; and such trustee may, by suit in the court
of common pleas, or otherwise, compel the delivery to him of all such 
r
roperty, moneys, books, papers, evidences of title, and other effects. 

SEc. 6341. On the resignation or removal of an assignee, or trustee
appointed by the court, such assignee or trustee shall forthwith file and
settle his account, and on the death of any such assignee or trustee,
his legal representative shall forthwith file and settle such account; and
immediately after such settlement, such assignee, or trustee, or his legal
representative, shall pay over to his successor all moneys found due
from him to the trust; and on failure so to do, or on failure to file and
settle such account, or deliver over to his successor all property,
moneys, books, evidences of title, papers, and other effects in ~my way
belonging to the trust, such successor may, by action in the <·011111100 
pleas or otherwise, proceed on his bond against such assignee, or
trustee, or his legal representative and the sureties in such bond. 

SEC. 6342. Whenever the court appoints a trustee to act in place
of the assignee of the debtor, the assignee and the debtor shall forth­
with convey to such trustee the title to all the real estate embraced in
the assignment. 
SEC. 6343. All assignments in trust to a trustee or trustees, made
in contemplation of insolvency, with the intent to prefer one or more 
creditors, shall inure to the equal benefit of all creditors, in proportion
to the amount of their respective claims, and the trusts arising under
the same shall be administered in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
SEC. 6344. All transfers, conveyances, or assignments made by a
debtor or procured by him to be made with intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud creditors, shall be declared void at the suit of any creditor; and
the probate judge of the proper county, ffter any such transfer, con­
veyance, or assignment shall have been declared, by a court of com­
petent jurisdiction, to have been made, with the intent aforesaid, or in
trust with the intent mentioned in the next preceding section, shall on
the application of any creditor, appoint a trustee according to the pro­
visions of this chapter, who, upon being duly qualified, shall proceed by
due course of law, to recover possession of all property so transferred, con­
veyed, or assigned, and to administer the same as in other cases of
assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors: provided, however,
that any creditor instituting a suit for the purpose aforesaid, shall cause
notice of the pendency and object thereof to be published for at least
four consecutive wee ks in some newspaper printed or of general cir­
culation in the county in which said suit shall be pending; and all
creditors who shall, within fifteen days next after the expiration of said
notice, file an answer in said action in the nature of a cross-petition,
praying to be made parties thereto, and setting forth the nature and
amount of their respective claims, and shall secure the payment of their
pro rata share of the costs and expenses of such action, including rea­
sonable counsel fees, in proportion to the amount of their said claims,
either by a deposit of money, or by an undertaking given to the plain­
tiff in such sum, and with such security as the. court or clerk thereof
shall require and approve, shall he first entitled, with the plaintiff, to
the benefits of such transfer, conveyance, or assignment, in proportion
to the amounts of their respective claims; and in case of such notice
being given, the court in which such transfer, conveyance, or assign­
ment shall have been declared to have been made with the intent afore­
said, may proceed fully to administer the trust, both as to the creditors
who are parties as aforesaid, and those who have not come in and been
so made parties, distributing to the latter the surplus, if any. after satis­
fying the claims of those who have preference as aforesaid; but if such
court shall not so administer the trust, or if such notice shall not have
been given, the said court shall forthwith, on declaring the intent afore­
said, cause a copy of the judgment to be certified to the proper probate 
court, which shall, on its own motion, appoint a trustee as in this chapter
provided; and after the costs and expenses aforesaid, and the claims
of the aforesaid preferred creditors shall have been paid by such trustee,
the residue in his hands, if any, shall inure to the equal benefit of the
.·emaining creditors, in proportion to the amount of their claims. 

SEC. 6345. In all cases of assignments heretofore made, where no
final settlement and distribution has been made, the pr?ba!e judge of 
the proper county shall have the power, on the application of any
creditor of the assignor, to issue a citation against such assignee,
requiring him to appear before such probate judge, on the day named
in such citation, to show cause why he should not give bail for the
execution of his trust according to the provisions of this chapter; and
such probate judge, on good cause shown, may require such assignee
to give bail according to the provisions of this chapter; and in case 
such assignee shall fail to appear as required by such citation, or shall
fail to give bail within the time ordered by such probate judge, such
probate judge shall remove him and appoint another trustee, and after
the giving bail by any assignee, or trustee so appointed, as provided in
this section, the same proceeding shall be had as provided in this chapter 
in case of assignments hereafter made. 
SEC. 6346. Every assignee, or trustee appointed on the assignee
failing to qualify, shall within thirty days after giving bond, cause 
notice to be given in some newspaper of general circulation in the
county, for three successive weeks, of his appointment as such assignee 
-or trustee. 
SEC. 6347. Immediately upon the assignee giving bond, or if the
.assignee fail to give bond, then upon the trustee appointed by the 
court giving bond, the court shall appoint three suitable, disinterested
persons appraisers of the property and assets of the assignor; and the
said assignee or trustee shall, within thirty days after giving bond, un-
less for good cause shown the court shall allow a longer time, make 
.and file in the court an inventory, verified by his oath, of all the prop-
erty, moneys, rights, and credits of the assignor included in the assign- 
ment, which shall have come to his possession or knowledge, together
with an appraisement thereof by said appraisers under their oath: pro-
vided, however, that if any part of said estate or effects be in any
other county, the assignee Or trustee may have appraisers as to such 
part of the estate and effects, appointed by any disinterested justice of
·such county; and provided, further, that if the assignment includes 
real estate situate without this state, it shall not be necessary to have
-such real estate appraised, but the assignee, or trustee appointed by the 

court, S a Se SUC rea estate at pu IC Or private Sa e, an t e Sa e
shall be confirmed, if the court find that the same has been made in 
good faith and for a fair price; and at the time of filing the inventory,
the assignee or trustee shall also file a schedule of all the debts and 
liabilities of the assignor within his knowledge, which schedule shall be
verified by the oath of the assignee or trustee; which schedule shall 
contain the post-office address of each of such alleged creditors as far
as the same can be given.
SEC. 6348. No assignment for the benefit of creditors shall be
construed to include or cover any property exempt from levy or sale 
on execution, or from ~eing by a_ny legal process ap~lied. to the pay­
ment of debts, unless in the assignment the exemption is expressly 
waived, or any property belonging to the wife of the assignor, nor to
require the assignor to deliver up any of such property; and as to the
homestead exemption, and exempt property that has to be selected by
the debtor and his wife, the appraisers appointed by the court shall, on
making the appraisement, set the same off in the same way that apprais-
ers of property levied on or attached are required to do; and if, for any
reason, this setting off is then omitted, the court may at any time
thereafter; and before sale, order the same to be done by the iippraisers. 

SEC. 6349. The probate judge may, on the application of the 
assignee, or of any creditor, or without any application, at all times
require the assignor, upon reasonable notice, to attend and to submit 
to an examination on oath upon all matters relating to the disposal of
nis property, to his trade and dealings with others, and his accounts
concerning the same, to all debts due or claimed from him, and to all
other matters concerning his property and estate, and the due settle­
ment thereof according to law, which examination may, at the request
of any party to the proceeding, be reduced to writing; and the said
probate judge may, in like manner, at any time before the final settle­
ment of the accounts of the assignee, require the attendance of the
assignee, or any other person as a witness, and examine him or her
upon oath, as to all matters appertaining to the estate of the assignor
or to the administration of the said trust; and the said probate judge
may, upon or after such examination, make and enforce any orders
upon proper parties, which he may deem necessary to prevent any 
fraudulent transfer or change in the property or effects of the assignor
or the allowance or payment of any unjust or fraudulent claim out of 
his estate.
SEC. 6350. The assignee or trustee shall proceed at once to con-
vert all the assets received by him into money, and to sell the real and 
. . 
personal property assigned, including stocks, and such bonds, notes.
and other claims as are not due, and which can not probably be col­
lected within a reasonable time, either for cash, or upon such other
terms as the court may order, at public auction, at such time and place
as may be designated in notice given by advertisement in some news­
paper of general circulation within the county, for four successive
weeks, and of which sale due return shall be made to the judge; but
all such sales of real estate shall be made at not less than two-thirds the
appraised value thereof, being subject to re .. ppraisement as upon execu­
tions at law, and such sale shall be set aside, or confirmed, as the court
shall order; and if confirmed, deeds shall be made to the purchasers,
conveying the title free from all liens on the same for all debts due by
the assignor. Whenever the court shall be satisfied that it would be for
the advantage of the creditors of the assignor to sell any part of the
real or personal property assigned, at private sale, the court may author­
ize the assignee or trustee to thus sell the same, either for cash, or upon
such other terms as the court may order ; but such real estate shall, in
no case, be sold for less than two-thirds its appraised value; nor shall such
personal property be sold for less than two-thirds of such appraisernent,
unless the court shall, upon good cause shown, order the assignee to
sell the same for a less amount; and a return of such sale shall be 
made within the time prescribed by the court ; and such sale shall be
confirmed by the court before the same shall be complete and binding;
and if confirmed, deeds shall be made of the real estat-, to the purchas­
ers, conveying the title, free from all liens or. the same, ior all debts
due by the assignor. Should any property thus crdered to be sold at
private sale, be not so sold within the time prescribed by the court,
then the court shall order the same to Le sold at public auction, in the
same manuer as though a private sale had not been ordered; and the
assignee, or trustee may with the approval of the court compromise or 
sell any claim or demand on behalf of the assignor which is desperate,
or of difficult collection; and he may, also, with the approval of the
probate court, complete and enforce all sales of real estate made by the 
assignor, making all needful conveyances for that purpose: provided,
however, that the limitation as to the price for which real estate shall 
be sold, shall not apply to real estate situate out of the state. 
SEC. 6351. The probate court shall order the payment of all in-
cumbrances and liens upon any of the property sold or rights and cred-

is incumbered with liens, or where any questions in regard to the title 
require a decree to settle the same, commence a civil action for the sale
of such real estate, in the court of common pleas of the proper county,
making all persons in interest, parties to such proceedings; and upon
hearing, such court shall order a sale of the premises, the payment of
incumbrances, and determine the questions involved in regard to the title to the same ; and the proceeds of the real estate so sold by order
of the court of common pleas, after payment of liens and incumbrances,
as ordered by such court, shall be reported to the probate court by the
assignee, and disposed of as provided in this chapter. 
SEC. 6352. Creditors shall present their claims within six months 
after the publication of the notice hereinbefore provided for, unless
urt er tune is a owe y t re court to t e assignee or trustee ror al ow-
ance and the assignee or trustee shall indorse his allowance or rej ection 
, , 
thereon, and claimants whose claims are rejected, shall be required to
bring suit against the assignee or trustee, to enforce such claims within
thirty days after the same shall have been rejected, in which, if he
recover, the judgment shall be against the assignee or trustee, that he
allow the same in settlement of his trusts, with or without the costs, as
the court shall think right; and immediately after the expiration· of said
six months, the assignee or trustee shall file in the court a report of all
claims presented to him for allowance, their several amounts, and the
date from which, and the rate at which the several claims are entitled
to interest, specifying what claims have been allowed, and what ones
rejected, with the date of allowance or rejection; and what, if any,
claims are held under advisement; and the post-office address of every
creditor whose claim is either allowed or rejected. 
SEC. 6353. If the assignor or any creditor shall file in the court a 
written requisinon on t e assignee or trustee to isa ow any C aim or 
claims presented, which he has not reported as disallowed, and shall

PPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY. 
SEc. 6415. Appropriations can only be made when the corpora­
tion is unable to agree with the owner, or his guardian or trustee, as to
the compensation to be paid for the property sought to be appropriated,
or when the owner is incapable of contracting in person or by agent,
and has no guardian or trustee, or is unknown, or his residence is 
beyond the state, or unknown. 
SEc. 6416. In any such case the corporation may file with the pro­
bate judge a petition, verified as in a civil action, containing a specific
description of each parcel of property, interest, or right, within the
county, sought to be appropriated, the work, if any, intended to be con­
structed thereon, the use to which the same is to be applied, the neces­
sity for the appropriation, the name of the owner of each parcel, if
known, or if not known, a statement of that fact, the names of all per­
sons having or claiming an interest, legal or equitable, in the property,
so far as the same can be ascertained, and a prayer for the appropria­ 
tion of the property. 
SEC. 6417. The petition may include one or more of the parcels
of property, rights, or interests in the county in which it is filed; and
when any such parcel, right, or interest, is situated in two or more
counties, the petition may be filed in either of the counties in which an
owner is resident, and if no owner is resident therein, it may be filed in 
either. 
SEC. 6418. Upon the filing of a precipe therefor, the probate judge
shall issue summons for the owners, and persons named in the petition
as residents of the state and having an interest, which may be directed
to the sheriff of any county, and shall command him to notify the per­
sons named therein of the filing of the petition, and to appear thereto
at a time to be fixed by the judge, and named therein, not less than five
nor more than fifteen days from the date thereof, and which shall be
-served and returned as in a civil action. When a writ is returned 
"not summoned," other writs may be issued, until the parties are duly
summoned. 
SEc. 6419. When a person having an interest is unknown, or his
residence is beyond the state, or unknown, the corporation may make ser­
vice by publication against him, by publishing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county where the petition is filed, for four consecu­
tive weeks, a notice containing a summary statement of the object and
prayer of the petition, so far as it relates to the property of the person
thus to be notified, the court in which it is filed, and the time when such
person is to appear thereto, not less than ten nor more than twenty days 
after the last publication; and the fact of publioation may be proved
by the affidavit of any person knowing the same.
SEc. 6420. On the day named in any summons rstserved, or publi­
cation first completed, the probate judge shall hear and determine the 
questions of the existence of the corporation, its right to make the
appropriation, its inability to agree with the owner, and the necessity for
the appropriation. Upon these questions the burden of proof shall be
upon the corporation, and any interested person shall be heard.
SEC. 6421. If the judge determine these questions for the corpo-
ration, as to any or all of the property, and persons interested therein, 
he shall issue an order to the clerk and sheriff to draw sixteen names
from the jury box, as in other cases, and within two days after the
receipt of the same, they shall execute the order, and the clerk shall
forthwith return it to the probate judge, with a list of the names drawn
indorsed thereon; and the judge shall issue to the sheriff a venire for
the jurors so drawn to attend at his office, at a time to be fixed by him,
and named in the writ, not exceeding ten days from the date thereof,
which shall be served and returned as in other cases. 

SEC. 6422. The owners of each separate parcel, right, or interest,
shall be entitled to a separate trial by jury, verdict, and judgment. 
They shall hold the affirmative on the trial, which shall be conducted,
and evidence shall be admitted, and bills of exception may be taken,
as provided in civil actions.
SEC. 6423. The court may amend any defect or informality in any
of the proceedings authorized or required by this chapter, or cause 
new parties to be added, and direct such further notice to be given to
any party in interest as it deems proper. 
SEC. 6424. The court may direct the order and fix the time of the
several trials,· ma}' adjourn or continue any· trial for the purpose of 
obtaining proper service upon any property owner, or when deemed
necessary for the proper and convenient trial of the several cases; and
may discharge any jury, and cause other juries to be impaneled, as pro­
vided in this chapter. 
SEC. 6425. When, by reason of non-attendance, sickness, or other
cause, any o t c sixteen persons are not present an in con 1t10n to
serve as jurors, the judge shall order the sheriff to fill the vacancies 
with talesmen; and when the list of sixteen is full, the judge shall call
upon each separately, beginning with the first named on the list, to take
his place in the jury box, and shall personally inquire of each, as called,
whether he is interested in any way in any of the property, rights, or
interests sought to be appropriated, or in the corporation which filed
the petition, either as owner, stockholder, agent, attorney, or other­
wise; and if such person answer in the affirmative, or if it be shown to
the judge, by satisfactory evidence, that he is so interested, he shall be
excused from serving on the jury, and the next person on the list shall
be called, and interrogated in like manner; and if the list of sixteen
be exhausted before a proper jury of twelve men is taken and accepted
therefrom, the judge shall order the sheriff to fill the remaining vacan- 
cies in the jury box required to make up the number of twelve, with
talesmen, who shall be interrogated as herein above provided. 

SEC. 6426. When the jury box is filled with twelve disinterested
jurors, the owners of the property which is the subject of the trial, 
jomtly, an t re petinoner, s a eac 1 ave t e right to two peremptory
challenges, and to challenge for cause; and all vacancies arising in the
jury from challenge, or otherwise, shall be filled by talesmen having
the qualifications prescribed in the last section, to be ascertained as
therein provided. 
SEC. 6427. When the jury is filled, the probate judge shall admin- 
ister to tbem the following oath : '' You, and each of you, do solemnly
swear that you will justly and impartially assess, according to your best 
judgment, the amount of compensation due to the proper owners in
the cases which will be brought before you in this proceeding, by reason
of the appropriation of their property described in the petition, to the
use of (here name the corporation], in the proceeding now pending,
irrespective of any benefit from any improvement proposed by such
corporation; and you do further swear that you will, in assessing any
damages that may occur to such property owners, by reason of the
appropriation, other than the compensation, further ascertain how much
less valuable the remaining portion of said property will be in conse-
quence of such appropriation; this you swear as you shall answer to 
God." 
SEC. 6428. The probate judge may, upon motion of either party,
issue the following writ to the sheriff, to wit: " To the shtnjf of--- 
,011111): You are hereby commanded to conduct the twelve jurors
named in the panel to this writ annexed, to view the property or prern-
ises sought to be appropriated by 
tion], and owned by 
on-----, the --- day of , then and there to view
the premises or property aforesaid, 
part of the corporation aforesaid,] and C. D. on the part of the owner,
appointed by this court, and you shall make return of the manner you
have executed this writ to this court, on the -- day of---, A D . 
. " The writ shall be signed by the probate judge, and certified
under his seal of office.
SEC. 6429. The judge shall also deliver to the sheriff a copy of
that part of the petiti~n conta~ning a separate description ?f each _p~r- 
eel of property, and rights or mterests sought to be appropriated within
the county, which the jury is required to view; he may appoint, to be
present at the view, the two persons named in the writ; and the sheriff
who is to execute the writ shall, by a special return upon the same,
certify under his hand that the view has been made according to the
command thereof. The expenses of taking the view shall be taxed in
the bill of costs, and no evidence shall be given on either side at the
taking thereof.
SEC. 6430. Witnesses may be examined before the jury after its
return to the court; but if more than three witnesses be examined by 
either party, on the same point in the same case, the judge may tax the 
costs of such additional witnesses to theparty calling them.
SEC. 6431. When a building or other structure is situated partly
upon land sought to he appropriated, and partly upon adjoining land,
and such structure cannot be divided upon the line between such two
tracts of land without manifest injury, the jury, in assessing the compen­
sation to any owner of the lands, shall assess the value of the same
exclusive of the structure, and make a separate estimate of the value
of the structure; the owner of the structure may elect to retain the
ownership of the same, and to remove it, or accept the value thereof as
estimated by the jury; if he fail to make such election within ten days
from the date of the report of the jury, or within ten days from the
termination of the cause in any higher court to which it may be taken, he
shall be deemed to have elected to retain and remove the structure;
but if he elect to accept the value of the structure, the title thereto shall
vest in the corporation making the appropriation, which shall have the
right to enter upon the land for the purpose of removing the structure 
therefrom.
SEC. 6432. The jury shall render its verdict in writing, signed by
the foreman, to the judge, who shall cause it to be entered of record;
and unless for good cause shown, upon motion to be filed within ten
days after the verdict is rendered, a new trial be granted, the judge shall
enter a judgment confirming such verdict. 
SEc. 6433. Upon payment to the party entitled thereto, or deposit
with the probate judge, of the amount of the verdict, and such costs as
have lawfully accrued in the case up to the time against the corporation,
the corporation shall be entitled to take possession of, and shall hold,
the property. rights, or interests so appropriated, for the uses and pur­
poses for which the appropriation was sought, as set forth in the peti­
tion, and the judge shall enter of record an order to that effect, and if
necessary, proper process shall be issued to place the corporation in pos­ 
session thereof. 
SEC. 6434. The corporation may abandon any case or proceeding
after paying into court the amount of the defendant's costs, expenses,
and attorney fees, as found by the court. If the corporation fail in any
case to make payment or deposit, as provided in the preceding section,
within thirty days after confirmation of the verdict, the probate judge,
on motion of the party entitled to such payment, to be filed within ten 
days after the expiration of said .thirty days, shall enter an order direct­
ing the corporation to make such payment or deposit within thirty days
after the date of such order; and unless such corporation, within said
thirty days, make such payment or deposit, it shall be held and consid­
ered to have thereby abandoned the property, rights, or interests so
appropriated, and all claims thereon under its proceeding,. and the judge
shall issue an order to that effect; the judge shall also enter a judgment
against the corporation, and in favor of the party entitled to such pay­
ment, for such amount of expenses, including time spent, and attorney
fees, incurred by him in the proceeding, as the court, upon the evidence
offered in that behalf, deems just and reasonable, for which execution
may be issued against the corporation; and the directors of the corpo­
ration, individually, shall be liable upon such judgment, and may be made
parties thereto by action. 
SEC. 6435. If such judgment be not satisfied within thirty days
after the rendition thereof, or if the party entitled thereto be not satis- 
fied with the amount -thereof, such party shall have a right ( of action]
against the petitioner for his expenses aforesaid, including urne spent, 
and attorney fees, and also for his expenses, including. reasonable
attorney fees, incurred in prosecuting such action ; but the action shall
be brought within six months after the rendition of the judgment in
the probate court.
SEc. 6436. A new trial shall be granted for cause only, shall take
place in the same court where the first trial was had, and shall be con- 
ducted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter for the first
trial, so far as they are applicable; and upon the granting of the motion
for a new trial, if the amount of the first verdict has been paid into
court, the probate judge shall retain the same until the final termina­
tion of the second trial; but if, upon the new trial, the verdict of the 
jury exceed the amount of the first verdict. the corporation sha11 pay
the amount of the first verdict, together with the excess, to the owner
of the property ; and if the verdict upon the second trial be less than
that of the first, the probate judge shall repay to the corporation the
difference. If a new trial be granted at the instance of the, owner of
the property, and the verdict of the jury be. the same or less in amount
than that first rendered, the owner shall pay the whole costs of the
second trial; and if.it be more than that first rendered, the costs of the
second trial shall he paid by the corporation.
SEC. 6437. Either party may file a petition in error in the court
of common pleas of the proper county, within thirty days from the 
rendition of the final judgment in the probate court, and the proceed-
ings in error shall be conducted as in civil actions; but the corporation
may, on the rendition of the final judgment in the probate court, pay
into said court the amount of the judgment for compensation and costs
therein rendered, and proceed to enter upon and appropriate the 
property, notwithstanding the pendency of the proceedings in error. 

SEC. 6438. If the court of common pleas, upon the hearing of
the cause, affirm the judgment of the probate court, all the costs in the 
court of common pleas shall be paid by the plaintiff in error ; and if

judgment, as in other cases, which trial shall be had at the term of
reversal of the judgment, unless for good cause shown by either party

nine or sixteen, or through any part of sections granted by congress in
lieu of section sixteen, for school purposes, and such lands remain
unsold, or through any town lot or parcel of ground used for or
devoted to school purposes, it may appropriate so much of such land
or lots as may be necessary for the purposes aforesaid; and service of
the summons made on such trustees or school officers as have posses­
sion or control of the lands, shall have the same force and effect as service
in any other case on owners of land sought to be appropriated. The
money arising from such appropriation shall be disposed of by such
trustees or school officers in accordance with law.
SEc. 6440. When the probate judge is interested, either as stock­
holder, director, or otherwise, in a corporation seeking to appropriate
private property to its use, the proceedings authorized by this chapter
may be commenced in the court of common pleas of the county; and
in that case the proceedings shall conform in all respects, so far as
applicable, to the provisions of this chapter, and all the powers con­
ferred and duties imposed thereby upon the probate court shall devolve
upon the court of common pleas; and said court may make such
orders, and direct such proceedings to be had, as may be necessary to
do full justice between the parties, according to the true spirit and
intent of this chapter; and after final judgment the corporation may,
on depositing the amount of the judgment and costs assessed in said
court, with the clerk thereof, be entitled to enter into r+ of the
property sought to be appropriated. 
SEC. 6441. When a party in interest is unknown, or his residence
is unknown, and when service has been made by publication, and the
party has not appeared in the proceepings by a~ent or attorney, or
when such party in interest is under any legal disability, and has no
legal guardian, or trustee, within the county where the action is brought,
the court shall appoint some competent attorney to attend upon the
proceedings, and protect the rights and interests of such party; and
the court shall fix the amount of the fees of the attorney for such
service, which shall be payable out of any money paid on the judg­
ment rendered in such case for property appropriated. 
SEC. 6442. When there are diverse or conflicting claims, legal or
equitable, to the real estate, or any interest therein, sought to be appro- 
priated under the provisions of this chapter, the jury or court shall not
pass upon the same in the proceedings for appropriation, but such 
claims shall be reserved for adjudication as hereinafter provided.
SEC. 6443. Upon the payment of the money into court by the cor-
poration, a party claiming a legal or equitable interest in the property, 
or the money arising therefrom by such appropriation, may file his
petition in the court of common pleas of the proper county, making
the other claimants to the property or money parties thereto, setting
forth the facts on which the claim is founded, the fact of the appropria­
tioa of the property, the amount of money so paid in therefor, and
sud, other facts as are proper to enable the court to hear and determine
the matter between the claimants; and the court shall forthwith appoint
some master of the court, or other suitable person selected by the par­
ties, to hold and safely keep such fund, or invest the same in the man­
ner the court shall direct, after hearing the parties; and such fund
shall thenceforth represent the land, and the interests therein, and be
subject to the control of the court having jurisdiction of the case, by
orders entered in the action, according to the rights of the parties to
the land or fund, as from time to time the court may determine. 
SEC. 6444. Such proceeding in the court of common pleas, shall 
be considered and held to be a civil action; and the conflicting claims
of parties to the fund aforesaid shall be determined by the court, or by 
a jury trial, according as the claim is equitable or legal, in the same
manner as if the land had not been converted into money. 
SEC. 6445. A railroad corporation of this state may condemn and 
appropriate to its own use the interest and easement in, and quiet title
to, any unfinished road-bed, or part thereof, on the line of its proposed 
road, owned or claimed by any other company or companies, when it
has remained substantially in the same unfinished condition, and with-
out having the ties and iron placed thereon, for the period of ten years
or more. Every such company shall be made a party defendant to the
condemnation proceedings, and shall file an answer therein, setting
forth fully its title to and interest in such road-bed, or part thereof,
sought to be appropriated, if any it claim, to which answer the plain-
tiff shall plead issuably, unless it admit the validity of the defendant's 
claim.
SEC. 6446. When it is determined by the court, upon issue of 
law, or by the jury upon issue of fact, or by the admission of the
pleadings, or by reason of failure to plead that any such company 
asserting such ownership or claim is not entitled thereto, judgment, 
including costs, shall be rendered accordingly; but when it in like
manner is determined that any such company has an· interest in such
road-bed, or part thereof, so sought to be appropriated, the jury shall
determine and state the amount of compensation due to such company,
according to law, on account of the appropriation of such interest. 

SEC. 6447. Proceedings under the last two sections may be 
commenced in the court of common pleas, or superior court, of the
proper county; the case shall, on motion, be taken out of its order 
by the court, or by any appellate or reviewing court, and determined
without unnecessary delay; and proceedings in error to such common
pleas or superior court may be commenced directly in the supreme
court; but the provisions of this chapter as to viewers shall not apply 
to appropriations authorized by said sections. 
SEC. 6448. When a corporation authorized by Jaw to make appro-
priation of private property has taken possession of and is occupying 
or using the land of any person for any purpose, and the land so occu-
pied or used has not been appropriated and paid for by the corporation, 
or is not held by any agreement in writing with the owner thereof, the
owner or owners, or either of them, may serve notice in writing upon 
the corporation, in the manner provided for the service of a summons
against a corporation, to proceed under this chapter to appropriate the
land; and on failure of such corporation, for ten days, so to proceed,
the owner or owner" may file a petition in the probate court of the
proper county, sertir-; forth the fact of such use or occupation by the
corporation, that the corporation has no right, legal or equitable, thereto,
that the notice provided in this section has been duly served. that the
time of limitation under the notice has elapsed, and such other facts,
including a pertinent description of the land so used or occupied, as
may be proper to a full understanding of the facts. 
SEC. 6449. A summons shall issue, and be served upon the cor­
poration, and thereafter the proceedings in said court shall be conducted 
to final judgment, in all respects, as provided in this chapter; and if
the corporation fail to pay the judgment and costs awarded against it in
the proceeding, the same may be collected by execution as in other
cases; but this section shall not be construed to impair or lessen, in
any manner, the right the owner or owners may have to proceed
against the corporation as in all other cases of the unlawful entry upon
lands. 
SEC. 6450. If execution issued as provided in the last section be
returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, with the indorsement that no 
goods or chattels, lands or tenements, can be found whereon to levy, or

rendition thereof, the court may, by injunction, restrain the corporation
from using or occupying the lands until the judgment and costs are fully 
paid.
SEC. 6451. The jurors summoned, and attending or serving, in 
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, shall each receive the
same fees per day as are provided by law tor jurors in the court of 
common pleas, and also five cents per mile for each mile of the distance
they are compelled to travel in the discharge of their duties; the 
witnesses shall be allowed the same fees and mileage as are allowed for

to such fees as he is allowed by law for similar services in other cases,
but he shall not be allowed anything in the way of poundage, except
on money made on execution; the clerk shall be entitled to a fee of one
dollar and fifty cents for drawing, and certifying to the probate judge,
the list of jurors; the probate judge shall be allowed to enter a charge
of five dollars in the cost bill for each day occupied in the trial of a
cause, in addition to his other fees provided by law; and the whole
costs so taxed shall be adjudged against and paid by the corporation,
except as provided in the next section.
SEC. 6452. A corporation, by its proper officer, agent, or attor-
neyvmay, at the time of filing the petition with the probate judge. de­ 
posit with such judge such sum of money, for each separate parcel of
property as it deems a just and equitable compensation for the prop­
erty, rights, and interests described in the petition, and sought to be
appropriated; and when the final verdict of the jury as to any pared
of property does not exceed the amount so deposited, and the owner
has refused, after notice of such deposit, to accept the same, the whole
costs of the proceeding as to such parcel shall be equally divided be­
tween the corporation and the owner or owners of the property; and
when the final verdict as to any parcel or parcels exceeds, and as to
other parcel or parcels does not exceed, the amount deposited, the pro­
bate judge shall apportion the costs in such manner as he may deem
equitable and just. 
SEC. 6453. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to pro­
ceedings by state, county, township, district, or muncipal authorities, to 
appropriate private property for public uses, or for roads or ditches; and
in all such cases it shall be optional with such authorities to pay the
judgment rendered against them according to section sixty-four hundrea
and llzirty-lwo, or to pay the costs and decline to take the propertv

SEC. 6488. Upon the return of said order of arrest, executed in
pursuance of the preceding section, the trial of said cause shall proceed, 
unless for good cause shown, upon the application of either party, or at
the instance of the justice himself, the same shall he continued for any
period, as is provided for in other cases before justices of the peace;
and when the trial of said cause is continued for any period, the defend-
ant, upon executing with one or more sufficient sureties, a written under-
taking to the plaintiff in the premises, and to the acceptance of the jus-
tice, to the effect that if judgment shall be rendered in the action against

than one hundred and fifty dollars, and that only the excess over that
amount is sought to be attached; and also the existence of some one,
or more, of the following particulars: 
1. That the defendant, or one of several defendants, is a corpora­
tion, having no officer upon whom a summons can be served, or place
of doing business in the county, or is a non-resident of the county:
provided, that noproceedings in attachment shall be had to garnishee

granted, unless the claim is for a debt or demand arising upon contract,
judgment, or decree, and no attachment shall issue by virtue of this chapter, against the personal earnings of any defendant for services
rendered by such defendant within three months betore the commence­
ment of the action or the issuing of the attachment, unless the defend­
ant is not the head or support of a family, or unless the amount of
such earnings exceed, one hundsed and fifty dollars, and then only as 
to the excess over that amount. 
SEc. 6490. When the ground of attachment is, that the defendant
is a foreign corporation, or a non-resident of the county, the order of
attachment may be issued without an undertaking, but in aJJ other cases,
the order of attachment shall not be issued by the justice until there
has been executed in his office, by one or more sufficient sureties of the
plaintiff, to oe approved by the justice, an undertaking, not Jess than
double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, to the effect that the plaintiff
shall pay the defendant all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the attachment, if the order be wrongfully obtained. r 51 v. 179, ~ 29.] 
SEC. 6491. The order of attachment may be made to accompany
the summons, or at any time afterward, before judgment; it shall be 
addressed and delivered to any constable of the proper township, and
shall require him to attach the goods, chattels, stocks, or interests in
stocks, rights, credits, moneys, and effects of the defendant in his
county, not exempt by law from being applied to the payment of the
plaintiff's claim, or so much thereof as will satisfy the plaintiff's claim,
to be stated in the order as in the affidavit, and the probable costs of
the action, not exceeding fifty dollars. 
SEc. 6492. The return day of the order of attacf1ment, when

returned forthwith. 
SEC. 6493. When there are several orders of attachment against
the same defendant, in the hands of the same officer, they shall "be exe- 
cuted in the order in which they were received by said officer; he shall

in the presence of two credible persons, declare that by virtue of said
order, he attaches said property at the suit of such plaintiff; and the
officer, with two householders of the county, who shall be fir rt sworn
by the officer, shall make a true inventory and appraisement of all
property attached, which shall be signed by the officer and said house-
holders, and returned with the order; when the property can be come at,
he shall take the same into his custody, and hold it subject to the order of 
the justice. 
SEC. 6494. The constable shall deliver the property attached to
the person in. whose possession it was found, upon the execu~on by 
such person, m the presence of the constable, of an undertaking to
the plaintiff, with one or more sufficient sureties resident in the county,
to the effect that the parties to the same are bound, in double the
appraised value thereof, that the property or its appraised value in
money shall be forthcoming to answer the judgment of the court in
the action; but if it shall appear to the court that any part of said
property has been lost or destroyed by unavoidable accident, the value
thereof shall be remitted to the person or persons so bound. 

SEC. 6495. Different attachments of the same property may be
made, and one inventory and appraisement shall be sufficient; the lien
of the attachments shall be in the order in which they are served, and 
the subsequent attachments shall be served on the property, as in the
hands of the officer, and subject to the prior attachments; the justice,
who issued the attachment having the priority of lien, shall determine
all questions as to the priority of liens on the property attached. 

SEC. 6496. If the order of attachment is made to accompany the
summons a copy thereof and the summons shall be served upon the 
' .   
defendant m the usual manner for the service of a summons, if the
same can be done within the county; and when any property of the 
defendant has been taken under the order of attachment, and it shall
appear that the summons issued in the action has not been, and cannot 
be served on the defendant in the county, in the manner prescribed by
law, the justice of the peace shall continue the cause for a period not 
less than forty, nor more than sixty days; whereupon the plaintiff shall
proceed for three consecutive weeks to publish in some newspaper 
printed in the county, or if none be printed therein, then in some news­
paper of general circulation in said county, a notice, stating the names
of the parties, the time when, by what justice of the peace, and for
what sum said order was issued, and shall make proof of such publica­
tion to the justice; and, thereupon, said action shall be proceeded
with, the same as if said summons had been duly served. 

SEC. 649 . When the cause is contmue as provi e for in the
preceding section, and it shall appear that any of the property taken 
under the attachment is live stock, or is of a perishable nature, the jus-
tice. may issue his order, directing the officer, having the custody 
thereof, to dispose of the same as upon execution: and the money real­
ized therefrom shall be paid over to the justice and applied as other
money realized from the sale of the property attached is applied. 

SEC. 6498. When the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall make
oath in writing, that he has good reason to, and does believe that any 
person or corporation, to be named and within the county where the
action is brought, has property of the defendanttdescribmg the same),
in his possession, if the officer cannot come at such property, he shall
leave with such garnishee, a copy of the order of attachment, with a
written notice, that he appear before the justice, at the return of the
order of attachment and answer, as hereinafter provided. 

SEC. 6499. The copy of the order and notice shall be served upon
the garnishee, as follows: If he be a person, they shall be served upon
him personally, or left at his usual place of residence; if a corporation,
they shall be left with the president, or other head of the same, or the
secretary, cashier, ·or managing agent thereof. 
SEC. 6500. The garnishee shall appear before the justice in accord-
ance with the command of the notice, and shall answer, under oath,
all questions put to him touching the property, of every descrip­
tion, and credits of the defendant, in his possession or under his con­
trol, and he shall disclose, truly, the amount owing by him to the
defendant, whether due or not; and in the case of a corporation, any
stock therein held by or for the benefit of the defendant, at or after the 
-service of nctice. 
SEc. 6501. A garnishee may pay the money owing to the defend­ 
ant by him, to the constable having the order of attachment, or into the
court; he shall be discharged from liability to the defendant, for any 
money so paid, not exceeding the plaintiff's claim; he shall not be sub­
jected to costs beyond those caused by his resistance of the claim­
against him; and if he disclose the property in his hands, or the true
amount owing by him, and deliver. or pay the same according to the
order of the court, he shall be allowed his costs. 
SEC. 6502. If the garnishee do not appear and answer, as required,
the justice may proceed against him by attachment as for a contempt. 

SEc. 6503. If the garnishee appear and answer, and it is discov-
ered on his examination, that at or after the service of the order of
attachment and notice upon him, he was possessed of any property of
the defendant, or was indebted to him, the justice may order the
delivery of such property, and the payment of the amount owing by 
the garnishee, into the court; or may permit the garnishee to retain the
property or the amount owing, upon the execution of an undertaking
to the plaintiff, by one or more sufficient sureties, to the effect, that the
amount shall be paid, or the property forthcoming, as the court may 
direct.
SEC. 6004. If the garnishee fail to appear and answer, or if he
~ppear ~nd an~wer, and his _disclosure is not sati~fa<:tory to t~e plain- 
tiff; or if he fail to comply with the order of the Justice to dehver the
property and pay the money owing, into court, or give the undertaking
required in the preceding section, the plaintiff may proceed against him
in an action, in his own name, as in other cases ; and, thereupon, such
proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment may be ren-
dered in favor of the plaintiff, for the amount of the property and
credits of every kind of the defendant in the possession of the gar-
nishee, and for what shall appear to be owing by him to the defendant,
and for the costs of the proceedings against the garnishee ; if · the
plaintiff proceed against the garnishee by action, for the cause that his
disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appear in the action that such
disclosure was incomplete, the plain tiff shall pay the costs of such
action ; the judgment in this action may be enforced as judgments in
other cases; when the claims of the plaintiffs in attachment are satis-
fied, the defendant in attachment may, on motion, be substituted as 
the plaintiff in judgment. 
SEC. 6505. Final judgment shall not. be rendered against the
garnishee, until the action against the defendant in attachment has been 
determined ; and if, in such action, judgment be · rendered for the
defendant in attachment, the garnishee shall he discharged, and recover 
costs; if the plaintiff shall recover against the defendant in attachment,
and the garnishee shall deliver up all property, moneys, and credits
of the defendant, in his possession, and pay all the moneys from him
due as the court may order, the garnishee shall be discharged, and the
costs of the proceedings against him shall be paid out of the property
and moneys so surrendered, or as the court may think right and proper. 

SEC. 6506. If judgment be rendered in favor of the defendant in
the original ~ction, the attachment shall be disch~rged, and the pro~er!Y 
attached, or its proceeds shall be returned to him, unless the plaintifr
shall, within a certain time, to be fixed by the justice, give an under- 
taking for an appeal to the court of common pleas, which time shall
not exceed ten days, during which time, so fixed by the justice, the
property shall not be returned to the defendant, and in case of appeal
by either party, the attachment shall be continued in and determined
by the court of common pleas in the same manner as though said
attachment had been issued from said court of common pleas; when
the plaintiff shall appeal, the -undertaking shall be at least in double the
amount of the appraised value of the property attached, and in addi-
tion to the conditions now provided by lawfor undertakings in appeals,
shall contain a provision to pay defendant all damages sustained, if it
shall be found m the court of common pleas that said attachment was
wrongfully obtained. 
SEc. 6507. If judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall be
satisfied as follows: so much of the property remaining in the hands of 
the officer, after applying the moneys arising from the sale of perish-
able property, and so much of the personal property, if any, whether 
held by legal or equitable title, as may be necessary to satisfy the judg­
ment, shall be sold by order of the justice, under the same restrictions
and regulations as if the same had been levied on by execution ; and
the money arising therefrom, with the amount which may be recovered 
from the garnishee, shall be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs; 
if there be not enough to satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand,
and execution may issue thereon, for the residue, in all respects as
in other cases; any surplus of the attached property, or its proceeds, 
shall he returned to the defendant, 
SEC. 6508. The justice may order the constable to repossess him­
self, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached property, which
may have passed out of his hands without having been sold, or con­
verted into money; and the constable shall, under such order, have the
same power to take the property, as he would have under an order of 
attachment. 
SEC. 6509. If any of the property which has been attached, be
claimed by any person other than the defendant, the claimant may have 
the validity of such daim tried, and such proceedings must be had thereon,
with like effect, as in case the property had been seized upon execution 
issued by the justice and claimed by a third person. 
SEC. 6510. When several attachments are executed on the same
property, or the same persons are made garnishees, the justice, issuing 
the first order, served on the motion of any of the plaintiffs, may deter­
mine the amounts and priorities of the several attachments, and the pro­ 
ceeds shall be applied accordingly. 
SEC. 6611. The officer shall return upon every order of attachment
what he had done under it; the return must show the property attached,
and the time it was attached; when garnishees are served, their names
and the time each was served must be stated; the officer shall also
return with the order all undertakings given under it. 
SEC. 6512. An order of attachment binds the property attached
from the time of service, and the garnishee shall stand liable to the 
plaintiff in attachment for all property, moneys, and credits in his hands,
or due from him to the defendant, from the time he is served with the
written notice to appear; but when property is attached in the hands of
a consignee, or other person having a prior lien, his liens thereon shall
not be affected by the attachment. 
SEC. 6513. Jf the defendant, or other person in his behalf, at any
t~me before judgment, ca.use an. unde.rtaking to be executed to the plain­ 
tiff by one or more sureties resident m the county, to be approved by
the justice, in double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, stated in his
affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of
the justice, the attachment in such action shall be discharged, and resti­
tution made of any property taken under it, or the proceeds thereof;
such undertaking shall also discharge the liability of a garnishee in such
action, for any property of the defendant in his hands. 

SEC. 6514. If in any case where an order of attachment has been
issued by a justice of the peace, it shall appear from the return of the 
officer, and if there is a garnishee in the case, then also from the exam-
ination of the garnishee, that no property, moneys, rights, credits, or 
effects of the defen~ant have been take!l under .the attachmen.t, but
that the defendant is the owner of an interest m real estate m the 
county, the justice before whom said action is pending shall, at the
request of the plaintiff, forthwith certify his proceedings to the court of
common pleas of the proper county, and thereupon the clerk of the
court of common pleas shall docket said cause, and the action shall be 
proceeded with in all respects as if the same had originated therein,
except that in all actions under this section, for any sum of which jus-
tices of the peace have exclusive original jurisdiction, if the defendant
be a non-resident of the county,'such non-residence shall be a ground 
ot attachment in the court of common pleas. 
SEC. 6515. When a debtor has sold, conveyed, or otherwise dis-
P?sed o~ his property,. with the fraudulent i!1tent to cheat! or defrau~ 
his creditors, or to hmder, or delay them m the collection of their
debts, or is about to make such sale, conveyance, or disposition of his
propecty with such fraudulent in tent, or is about to remove his prop- 
erty, or a material part thereof, with the intent, or to the effect of
cheating, or defrauding his creditors, or hindering, or delaying them 
in the collection of their debts, a creditor may bring an action on his
claim before it is due, and have an attachment against the property of
the debtor. 
SEC. 6616. The attachment authorized by the last section, may be
granted by the justice of the peace before whom the action is brought; 
but before such action shall be brought, or such attachment shall be 
granted, the plaintiff, his agent, or attorney, shall make an oath, in
writing, showing the nature and amount of the plaintiff's claim, that it 
is just, when the same shall become due, and the existence of some one
of the grounds for the attachment enumerated in the preceding sec-
tion.
SEC. 6517. In such action application for an attachment must be
made, and if the justice refuse to grant an order of attachment, the 
action shall be dismissed, but without prejudice to a future action. 
SEC. 6518. The order of the justice granting the attachment,
shall specify the amount for which it is allowed, not exceeding the sum
sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim and the probable costs of the 
action. 
SEc. 6519. The order of attachment shall not be issued by the
justice until there has been executed in his office such undertaking on 
the part of the plaintiff, as is provided for in other cases of attachment,
except when in other cases an undertaking is dispensed with. 

SEc. 8520. The plaintiff in such action shall not have judgment
on his claim before it is due, but the proceedings on attachment may 
be conducted without delay. 
SEC. 6621. The proceedings in other cases of attachment shall, so
far as they are applicable, resula.te the attachment authorized by this subdivision of this chapter. 
SEC. 6522. The defendant may, at any time before judgment,
upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move to discharge an attach­ 
ment as to the whole or any part of the property attached. 
SEC. 6523. If the motion ~ made. upon affidavit on the par~ of
the defendant, or papers and evidence m the case, but not otherwise, 
the plaintiff 'may op~se the same by affidavit, or other evidence in ad-
dition to that on which the order of attachment was made. 

SEc. 6524. Any party to a suit affected by an order discharging, 
M refusing to discharge an order of attachment, shall be entitled to
file a petition in error in the court of common pleas to reverse, vacate, 
or modify the same, and when necessary, a bill of exceptions may be
taken and signed for this purpose. 
SEC. 6525. When an order discharging an order of attachment is
made, and any person affected thereby shall except thereto, the justice 
shall fix a number of days, not exceedin~ ten, in which such party may
file his petition in error, during which time the property attached shall 
be held by the constable, or other officer, during which period the peti­
tion in error shall be filed, and the ~rty filing the same shall give an
undertaking to the adverse party, with surety to be approved by the
clerk of the court, in double the amount of the appraised value of the
property attached, conditioned to pay said adverse party all damages
sustained by such party in consequence of the filing of said petition in
error, in the event that said order of attachment shall be discharged by
the court in which said petition in error is filed; and on such under­
taking being filed, notice in writing shall forthwith be given by the
clerk through the plaintiff in error to the justice, and if such notice be
so given within the time limited by the justice, the justice or constable
shall continue to hold the property attached subject to the further order 
of the court. 
SEC. 6526. In all cases before a justice, the plaintiff, his agent, or 
attorney, shall file with such justice a bill of the particulars of his de·
mand; and the defendant, if required hy the plaintiff, his agent, or
attorney, shall file a like bill of the particulars he may claim as a set-off;
and the evidence on the trial shall be confined to the items set forth in 
said bins. 
SEc. 6627. The bill of particulars must state, in a plain and direct
manner, the facts constituting the cause of action, or the claim to be 
set off; and if either party omit to set up in his bill of particulars any
item which lawfully could be made part of the cause of action, set-off,
or counterclaim, the party making such omission shall not recover costs
of the adverse party in any subsequent action thereon; but this pro­
vision shall not apply to any item which may be stricken out by the
justice, or withdrawn by either party with his consent. 

SEC. 6528. The bill of particulars may be amended at any time
before the trial, or during the trial, or upon appeal, to supply any de-
ficiency, or omission in the items, when, by such amendment, substantial
justice will be promoted; if the amendment be made at the time of, or 
during the trial, and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the
justice by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party,
in consequence of such amendment, an adjournment must be granted;
the justice may also, in his discretion, require, as a condition of an 
amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by
the justice; but such payment can not be required, unless an adjourn- 
ment is made necessary by the amendment 

SEC. 6529. If on the return of process, or at any time before trial
shall have commenced, it shall be made satisfactorily to appear to the 
justice of the peace before whom any cause is instituted, or is pending
for trial, by the affidavit of either of the parties in the case: 
1. That such justice is a material witness for either party; or,
2. If a jury be demanded by the adverse party, then that he can 
not, as he verily believes, have a fair and impartial trial in such town­
ship, on account of the bias or prejudice of the citizens thereof, 
a change of the place of trial shall be allowed. (5 1 v. 17 9, § 5 7.] 
SEC. 6530. If the place of the trial be changed on account of the
justice being a material witness in the cause, such cause shall be trans- 
ferred for trial before some other justice of the peace of the same
township, if there be one there legally competent to try such cause; if 
there be no such justice within such township, or if such change be
granted on account of the bias or prejudice of the citizens of such
township against such party, or because the adverse party has an undue
advantage over him therein, the case shall be taken to some justice in 
an adjoining township of the same county. 
SEC. 6531. The justice granting such change, shall deliver or
transmit the papers in the cause, together with a certified transcript of 
the proceedings before him, to the justice to whom such change may 
be granted, who shall proceed therein, and have the same jurisdiction, 
powers, and duties, in all respects whatever, as if such suit had been
originally instituted before him. 
SEC. 6532. Before any such change shall be allowed, the costs, as
specified in the next following section, shall be paid by the party apply­ 
ing for such change, or he shall have confessed a judgment therefor
before the justice granting the change. 
SEC. 6533. When such change is at the instance of the plaintiff,
he shall be taxed with all the costs which have accrued, and which

THa STATE oF 0Hm, CouNTV: 
Tt1 , c,msta/JI, of----- tM11u1/s1'j : 
You are hereby commanded to summon ---- to appear before me at-----, in
said township, on the -- day of----, A. D. --, at -- o'clock in the -­ 
noon, to serve all a juror in a case pending before me, then and there to be tried. And this
they shall in nowise omit. 
And have you then and there this writ, with your doings thereon.
Given under my hand this -- day of , A. D. --. 

SEC. 6551. The constable shall serve such summons by a personal
service thereof, and return the same, indorsed with the names of the 
persons summoned, at the time appointed for the trial of the cause. 

SEC. 6552. Jurors, for neglecting, or refusing to attend when prop-
erly summoned, or refusing to serve when in attendance, shall be 
liable to the like penalty, and be proceeded against in the same manner
as witnesses who fail to attend, or refuse to testify. 
SEC. 6553. The constable shall be in attendance on the court at
and during the progress of the trial; and if, from challenge, or other 
cause, the panel shall not be full, he may fill the same in the same
manner as is done by the sheriff in the court of common pleas. 

SEC. 6554. When a jury shall be in attendance, and the cause shall
be continued, the jurors must attend at the time and place appointed 
for trial without further notice. 
SEC. 6555. If either party object to the competency of a juror,
the question thereon must be tried in a summary manner by the justice, 
who may examine the juror, or other witness under oath. 

SEC. 6556. The justice shall administer an oath to the jury, well
and truly to try the matter in difference between the parties, and a true 
verdict to give according to the evidence. 
SEC. 6557. After the jury shall have been sworn, they shall sit
together, and hear proofs and allegations of the parties; and, after 
hearing the same, shall be kept together in some convenient place,
under the charge of a constable, until they have agreed upon their
verdict, or shall be discharged by the justice. 
SEC. 6558. When the jury shall have agreed upon their verdict,
they shall deliver it to the justice publicly, who shall enter it upon his 
docket.
SEC. 6059. Whenever the justice shall be satisfied that a jury sworn
in any cause before him can not agree in their verdict, after having con- 
suited upon it a reasonable time, he may discharge them, and continue
the cause, and may, if required by either party, proceed to strike
another jury, as hereinbefore provided; the cause shall be continued to
such time as the justice thinks reasonable, unless the parties or their
attorneys agree on a longer or sheerer time, or unless they may agree
that the justice may render judgment on the evidence already heard 
before him. 
SEC. 6560. It shall be lawful for the justice before whom a cause
has been tried on motion and being satisfied that the verdict was ob- 
tained by fra~d, partiality, or undue means, at any time within four
days after the entering of judgment, to grant a new trial, and he shall
set a time for the new trial, of which the opposite party shall have at
least three days' notice. 
SEc. 6561. The opposite party shall also have a reasonable notice
of such motion for a new trial, if the same is not made on the day of
the former trial, and in the presence of such party; such notices to be
given by the applying party; if the new trial shall be granted, or the
jury be unable to agree, the proceedings shall be, in all respects, as 
upon the return of the summons. 
SEc. 6562. If either the plaintiff or defendant, in his bill of par­ 
ticulars, claim more than twenty dollars, the case may be appealed to
the court of common pleas, but if neither party demand a greater sum
than twenty dollars, and the case is tried by a jury, there shall be no 
appeal.
SEc. 6663. If, on appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment in his 
favor, he shall not recover a larger sum than twenty dollars, exclusive
of interest since the rendition of the judgment before the justice, he
shall be adjudged to pay all costs in the court of common pleas (includ­
ing a fee of five dollars for the defendant's attorney), and if the defend­
ant shall demand a set-off or counterclaim, or both, greater than twenty
dollars, and he appeal from a judgment rendered in his favor, and do
not recover twenty dollars, he shall in like manner pay all costs in the
appellate court, including a like fee to the plaintiff's attorney. 
§ i1~J. 6564. Upon the verdict being delivered to the justice, and
before judgment rendered thereon, each juror shall be entitled to receive
fifty cents at the hands of the successful party, which shall be taxed in

calling the jury, and the same shall be taxed in the cost bill against the 
losing party. 
SEc. 6565. In all cases before a justice of the peace, whether
tried by a jury or by the justice, either party shall have the right to
except to the opinion of the justice upon any question of law arising
during the trial of the cause; and when either party shall allege such
exceptions, it shall be the duty of the justice to sign and seal a bill con­
taining such exceptions, if truly a1leged, with the point decided, so that
the same may be made part of the record in the cause; and whenever
either party during the trial shall require time to prepare his bill of
exceptions, the justice shall appoint a time when the same shall be set­
tled and signed, not more than five days from the day of trial. 
SEC. 6566. At any time before trial and judgment rendered, the
l · iff d d f d · h J h 1. 
p amti an e en ant consenting t ereto, may rave t e cause SUu- 
mitted to the arbitrament of three disinterested men, who shall he
chosen by the parties; and if the arbitrators be present, they shall hear 
and determine the cause on oath, to he administered by the justice; but
if the persons chosen as arbitrators be not present, the justice shall
issue a summons for them to attend at the time and place appointed for
the trial, which shall be served by any constable, or the parties, as they
may agree; the fees of arbitrators shall be the same as that paid to 
jurors.
SEC. 6067. When the arbitrators shall convene and be qualified,
they shall proceed to hear and determine the cause, and make out their 
award in writing, which shall be valid when signed by any two of them,
and return the same to the justice; who· shall thereupon enter such
award on his docket, and thereon render judgment and issue execu-
tion, as in other cases. 
SEC. 6568. Every judgment rendered on such award shall con-
elude the rights of the parties thereto, unless it shall be made to appear 
to the justice of the peace who rendered such judgment, and within
ten days from the rendition of the same, or to the court- of common
pleas, on appeal, that such award was obtained by fraud, corruption, or 
other undue means. 
SEC. 6569. Whenever satisfactory proof shall be adduced before
such justice, within the period aforesaid, that such award was obtained
by fraud, corruption, or other undue means, it shall be competent for 
such justice to set aside such award and his judgment thereon rendered,
and thereupon proceed to such final trial and judgment, as if such 
award had never been made. 
SEC. 6570. But no appeal shall be al1owed to the court of com-
mon pleas, from a judgment of a justice of the peace rendered on an 
award, unless the party praying such appeal shall file with such justice
an affidavit, therein stating that he or she does verily believe that such
award was obtained by fraud, corruption, or other undue means.

shall render judgment thereon, and for the costs of suit, and award
execution as in other cases.

copy thereof at his usual place of abode in such county, of the time 
and place of the trial of the right to such property, which trial shall be
had before some justice of the county, at least one day prior to the
time appointed for the sale of such property.
SEC. 6574. If on the trial, the justice shall be satisfied from the
proof that the property, or any part thereof, belongs to the claimant or
claimants, such justice shall render judgment against the party in whose
favor such execution or attachment issued for the costs, and issue exe­
cution therefor, and shall, moreover, give a written order to the con- .
stable who levied on, or who may be charged with the duty of selling
such property, directing him to restore the same, or so much thereof
as may have been found to belong to such claimant or claimants. 
SEC. 6575. If the claimant or claimants fail to establish his or
their right to such property, and to every part thereof, the justice shall
render judgment against such claimant or claimants, for the costs that
have accrued on account of such trial, and issue execution therefor;

for the property so taken.

upon adjournment, or within one hour thereafter. 
3. When it is objected at the trial and appears by the evidence that
the action is brought in the wrong township. 
SEC. 6677. If either party fail to appear at the return day of the
summons, or fail to attend at the time to which a trial has been ad­ 
journed, or fail to make the necessary bill of particulars, or fail in the
proofs, the cause may proceed at the request of the adverse party, and
in all cases where a set-off or counterclaim has been filed before the
dismissal of the cause by the plaintiff, the defendant shall have the right
of proceeding to the trial of his claim, although the plaintiff may have
dismissed his action. In no case shall it be necessary to prove the exe- 
cution of any bond, promissory note, bill of exchange or contract, or
other written instrument, or any indorsement thereon, upon which suit
is brought, or set-off or counterclaim based, unless the party sought to
be charged as the maker, acceptor, or indorser of such bond, promis­
sory note, or bill of exchange, shall make and file with the justice of
the peace before whom the suit is pending, an affidavit that such instru­
ment of writing was not made, given, subscribed, accepted, or indorsed 
by him.
SEC. 6578. When judgment shall have been rendered against a
defendant. in his a~s~nce, the same may be set aside by the justice upon 
the followmg conditions:
1. That his motion be made within ten days after such judgment 
was entered, which motion shall be in writing, and sworn to by the
defendant, his agent, or attorney, setting forth a good and sufficient rea-
son for the absence of the defendant. 
2. That he pay or confess judgment for the costs awarded against
him. 
3. That he notify in writing the opposite party, his agent, or attorney,
or cause it to be done, of the opening of such judgment, and of the time
and place of trial, at least five days before the time, if the party reside
in the county; and if he be not a resident of the county, hy leaving a
written notice thereof at the office of the justice ten days before the
trial, provided that the judgment shall not be set aside more than once
on account of the absence of the defendant. 
SEc. 6679. Upon a verdict the justice must immediately render
judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the Justice, judgment 
must be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if the defend-
ant has been arrested or his property attached; in other cases, it must
be entered either at the close of the trial, or if the justice then desire
further time to consider, on or by the fourth day thereafter, both days
inclusive. 
SEC. 6680. When the amount due to either party exceeds the sum
for which the justice is authorized to enter judgment, such party may
remit the excess, and judgment may be entered for the residue. A
defendant need not remit such excess, and may withhold setting the
same off, and a recovery for the amount set off and allowed, or any part
thereof, shall not be a bar to his subsequent action for the amount with- 
held. 
SEC. 6681. If the defendant, any time before trial, offer in writing
to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified sum, the plain- 
tiff may immediately have judgment therefor with the costs then accrued;
but if he do not accept such offer before the trial and fail to recover, in
the action, a sum greater than the offer, he can not recover costs
accrued after the offer, but costs must be adjudged against him; but
the offer and failure to accept it, can not be given in evidence to affect
the recovery otherwise than as to costs as above provided. 

SEC. 6582. When judgment is rendered in a case where the
defendant is subject to arrest and imprisonment, it must be so stated in 
the judgment, and entered in the docket.

ment was rendered. 
SEC. 6584. The party appealing shall, within ten days from the
rendition of the judgment, enter into an undertaking to the adverse
party with at least one good and sufficient surety to be approved of by
such justice, in a sum not less than fifty dollars in any case, nor less
than double the amount of the judgment and costs, conditioned: 
1. That the appellant will prosecute his appeal to effect, and without
unnecessary 'delay: 
2. That if judgment be adjudged against him on the appeal, he will
satisfy such judgment and costs. 
Such undertaking need not be signed by the appellant. 

SEC. 6686. And the said justice shall make out a certified tran-
script of his proceedings, including the undertaking taken for such 
appeal, and shall on demand, deliver the same to the appellant, or his
agent, who shall deliver the same to the clerk of the court to which
such appeal may be taken, on or before the thirtieth day from the ren-
dition of the judgment appealed from, and such justice shall also
deliver, or transmit the bill or bills of particulars, the deposition, and
all other original papers, if any, used on the trial before him, to such
clerk, on or before the said thirtieth day from said judgment; and all
further proceedings before the justice of the peace in that case shall
cease and be stayed from the time of entering into such undertaking. 

SEC. 6686. The clerk, on receiving such transcript, and other
papers as aforesaid, shall file the same, and docket the appeal. 

SEC. 6687. The plaintiff in the court below shall be plaintiff in

said court next after the expiration of said thirty days, file a transcript
of the proceedings and judgment of such justice, and the said cause
shall, on motion of the appellee, be docketed ; and the court is
authorized and required, on his application, either to enter a judgment
in his favor similar to that entered by the justice of the peace, and for
all costs that have accrued in said court, and award execution thereon;
or such court may, with the consent of said appellee, dismiss the appeal
at the cost of the appellant, and remand the cause to the justice of the
peace, to be thereafter proceeded in as if no appeal had been taken. 

SEC. 6689. f the plaintiff, in the action before the justice, shall
appea rom any JU gment ren ere agamst sue P amn , an a ter
having filed his transcript and caused such an appeal to be docketed, 
according to the provisions of this chapter, shall fail to file a petition,
or otherwise neglect to prosecute the same to final judgement, so that
such plaintiff shall become nonsuit, it shall be the duty of the court to
render judgment against such appellant, for the amount of the judg-
ment rendered against him by the justice of the peace, together with
interest accrued thereon, and for costs of suit, and to award execution 
therefor, as in other cases. 
SEc. 6590. If both parties fail to enter such appeal within the
time limited as aforesaid, the justice, on receiving a cenificate from
the clerk of the court, stating that the appeal was not entered, or being
entered, was dismissed as aforesaid, shall thereupon issue execution
upon the judgment, in the same manner as if such appeal had never 
been taken. 
SEC. 6591. If any person appealing from a judgment rendered in

in favor of the plaintiff, and after h~vi!1g filed hi~ transcript an~ .caused 
such appeal to be docketed, the plaintiff shall fail to file a petition, or
otherwise fail to prosecute the same to final judgment, the defendant in
such action may file his answer setting up whatever claim or demand he 
may have against such plaintiff. and prosecute the same to final judg-
ment, in which case, if the defendant shall recover judgment against
the plaintiff, all costs which have accrued before the justice, and in the
appellate court, shall be adjudged against such plaintiff, or he may, on
motion to the court, suffer judgment to be entered against him for the
amount of judgment below, in which case all costs which have accrued
before the justice and in the appellate court, shall be adjudged against 
such defendant. 
SEC. 6593. When an appeal shall be dismissed, or when judgment
shall be entered in the court of common pleas against the appellant, 
the surety in the undertaking shall be liable to the appeJJee for the whole
amount of the debt, costs, and damages, recovered against the appel­ 
lant.

or has a special ownership or interest therein, stating the facts in rela­
tion thereto, and that he is entitled to the immediate possession of the

said plaintiff, or for the payment of any tax, fine, or amercement
assessed against him, or by virtue of an order of delivery issued under
this chapter, or any other mesne or final process issued against him:
provided, that such affidavit may omit the first and last clauses, and in
lieu thereof, show that the property was taken in execution on a judg­
ment or order other than an order of delivery aforesaid, and that the
same is exempt from such execution under the laws of this state. 

CHAPTER 10. 
REPLE\'JN. 
SEC. 6614. Upon such affidavit being made and filed with the
justice, he shall issue a summons as in other cases, but, in addition, 
commanding the constable immediately to seize and take into custody,
wherever they may be found in the county, the goods and chattels
mentioned in the affidavit, and deliver the same to the plaintiff. 

SEc. 6616. The constable shall execute the writ by taking the 
property therein mentioned. He shall also deliver a copy of the sum­
mons to the person charged with the unlawful detention of property, or
leave such copy at his usual place of residence; and shall make return
of the time and manner of service, the appraisernent of the property,
and any undertaking taken by him. 
SEC. 6616. The constable shall deliver to the plaintiff, his agent,
or attorney the property so taken except in the cases hereinafter pro- 
. ' t' ' . . 
vided, when there has been executed by one or more sufficient sureties
of the plaintiff, a written undertaking to the defendant in at least double 
the value of the property taken, but in no case less than fifty dollars,
to the effect that the plaintiff shall duly prosecute the action and pay
all costs and damages which may be awarded against him. In all cases
where the property replevied consists of heir-looms, personal keepsakes,
or other article of property, the value of which consists, in whole or in
part, in its being a relic, model, gift, family picture, painting, or rare
production of art or nature, and not wholly in its general marketable
character, the constable shall retain and safely keep the same, subject
to the order of the court: provided, the defendant, his agent, or attorney,
shall, on or before the time named in the summons for trial, file his
motion, in writing, with the justice of the peace (which said motion
shall be heard and determined before the trial, or before the said justice
shall certify the proceedings to the court of common pleas, as herein, 
after provided), for an order requiring the constable to retain said prop­
erty, subject to the final order of the court: provided further, that in
case the defendant does not file said motion, or the court, upon applica­
tion of either party, refuses to order the constable to retain said prop­
erty, for the reason that it does not belong to one or more of the kinds
of personal property aforesaid, the constable shall deliver said property
to the plaintiff, his agent, or attorney, upon the execution of an under­
taking as hereinbefore provided, within one day after the expiration of
the time for filing said motion, or, in case said motion is filed, within
one day after the refusal of the justice to order the constable to retain
the property as aforesaid; and, provided, further, in case the appraised
value of the property exceeds three hundred dollars, or in case an ap­
peal is taken from the final judgment and order of the justice of the
peace, the said justice shall order the constable to turn over the prop­
erty in his possession to the sheriff of his county, to be by said sheriff
held as in like cases originating in the court of common pleas. 
SEC. 6617. For the purpose of fixing the amount of the under-
taking, the value of the property taken shall be ascertained by the oath
of· two responsible persons, whom the constable shall swear truly to 
assess the value thereof. 
SEC. 6618. Whenever the appraised value of the property so taken
shall exceed three hundred dollars, the justice shall certify the proceed-
ings in the case to the court of common pleas of his county, and there-
upon shall file the original papers, together with a certified transcript of
his docket entries, in the clerk's office of said court, the case there to
be proceeded in as if such suit had been commenced in said court. 

SEC. 6619. I the undertaking, required as aforesaid, be not given
within twenty-four hours from the taking of the property under said 
order, the officer shall return the property to the defendant; and if the
officer deliver any property so taken to the plaintiff, his agent, or
attorney, or keep the same from the defendant, without taking such
security within the time aforesaid, or if he take insufficient security, he
shall be liable to the defendant in damages. 
SEC. 6620. In all cases where judgment is rendered against the
plaintiff, or if he otherwise fail to prosecute his action to final judgment, 
the justice shall, on application of the defendant, or his attorney, im-
panel a jury to inquire into the right of property, and right of posses-
sion of the defendant to the property taken. If the jury shall be
satisfied the said property was the property of the defendant at the com­
mencement of the action, or if they find that the defendant was entitled
to the possession only of the same at such time, then, and in either
case, they shall assess such damages for the defendant as are right and
proper, for which, with costs of suit, the justice shall render judgment
for the defendant, and the justice shall also order any property in the
possession of the constable to be delivered to the defendant. 

SEC. 6621. In all cases where the property has been delivered to
the plaintiff, when the jury shall find for the defendant, they shall also 
find whether the defendant had the right of property, or the right of 
 
possession only, at the commencement of the suit; and if they find
either in his favor, they shall assess such damages as they think right
and proper for the defendant, for which, with costs of suit, the court
shall render judgment for the defendant. In all cases where property
remains in the hands of the constable, as hereinbefore provided, the
jury shall find which party had the right of property and right of
possession, or right of possession only, at the commencement of the
suit; and if they find either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant, they
shall assess such damages as they think right and proper for the pre­
vailing party, for which, with costs of suit, the court shall render judg­
ment, and also order the constable to deliver such property to the party 
in whose favor judgment is rendered. 
SEc. 6622. In a11 cases, when the property has been delivered to
the plaintiff, where the jury shall find for the plaintiff, on trial, or on 
inquiry of damages, they shall assess adequate damages to the plaintiff
for the illegal detention of the property, for which, with costs of suit,
the justice shall render judgment against the defendant. 

SEC. 6623. When the property claimed has not been taken, or has
been returned to the defendant, for want of the undertaking required 
by section sixty-six hundred and sixteen, the action may proceed as one
for damages only, and the plaintiff shall be entitled to such damages
as are right and proper; but if the property be returned for want of
the undertaking required by said section, the plaintiff shall pay all costs
made by taking the same.
SEC. 6624. The constable, in executing tfie writ, may break open
any building or inclosure, in which the property claimed, or any part
thereof, is concealed ; but not until he has been refused an entrance
into said building or inclosure, and the delivery of the property, after 
having demanded the same.
SEC. 6625. No suit shall be instituted on the undertaking given
on the delivery of the property to plaintiff, before an execution issued 
on a judgment in favor of the defendant in the action shall have been
returned, that sufficient property, whereon to levy and make the amount
of such judgment, can not be found in the county. 
SEC. 6626. If any justice shall issue a writ to replevin property,
as is provided by this chapter, without the affidavit being made and
filed m his office, as is provided in section sixty-six hundred and thirlttn, 
the same shall be set aside at his costs, and he shall be liable in dama­
ges to the party injured.

before the justice on whose doc.ket the judgment is entered; whereupon,
such justice shall issue execution against the judgment debtor, which
shall be proceeded in as in other cases: provided, such bail shall not
thereby be discharged from liability, but may be proceeded against after
the expiration of the term of stay, in the manner as if execution had 
not issued as aforesaid. 
SEC. 6658. If the judgment debtor shall, within ten days after
levying such execution, enter into a further undertaking for the stay of
execution, during so much of the first stay as remains then unexpired,
and shall pay the costs of the execution issued against him, as aforesaid,

recall the execution; and the person who last became surety shall first
be proceeded against, until it shall appear, by the return of the con-
stable, that he or she has no goods and chattels whereon to levy, before
proceedings shall be instituted on the undertaking first given.

person who shall have entered himself bail on the docket of any justice

the goods and chattels of the defendant for the use of such bail, which
shall be so indorsed by the justice, and such bail shall also be entitled
to a transcript of such judgment, for his own use; which shall have the 
same force and effect as transcripts in other cases. 
SEc. 6660. At any time before the stay shall expire, if the justice
taking the surety, or his successor in office, shall become satisfied that 
the surety is insufficient, it shall be his duty to cause written notice
thereof to be given to the defendant, or if he be absent, that the same
be left at his residence, requiring him to give additional surety. If

third day after the giving of such notice, such fact shall be entered on

SEC. 6662. Every justice of the peace shall have the same power
and authority to issue executions for costs, in the san.e manner and in­
stances that the clerks of common pleas are authorized to issue such 
executions. 
SEC. 6663. The execution must be directed to a constable of the
county, and subscribed by the justice by whom the judgment was 
rendered, or by his successor in office, or by the justice in whose hands
the docket of any justice of the township has been placed, in conse­
quence of the justice who may have rendered judgment being unable
to issue by reason of sickness, absence, or any other cause; and must
bear date the day of its delivery to the officer to be executed. It must
intelligibly refer to the judgment, by stating the names of the parties,
and the name of the justice before whom, and of the county and town­
ship where, and the time when, it was rendered; the amount of the
judgment, and if less than the whole is clue, the true amount thereon,

personal property of the debtor, and pay the same to the party entitled
thereto. 
2. If it be a case where any of the judgment debtors are certified
on the docket as surety, it shall command that the money be made of
the personal property of the principal debtor, and for want thereof, of
the personal property of the surety. In such cases the personal prop­
erty of the principal, subject to execution within the jurisdiction, shall
be exhausted before any of the property of the bail shall be taken in 
execution. 
3 If it be a case where the defendant may be arrested in addition
to the foregoing. it must direct the officer, if sufficient property cf the
defendant, subject to the execution, can not be found to satisfy the judg­
ment, that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county,
until he pay the judgment or be discharged according to law, unless the
execution be accompanied by an order of arrest, as hereinafter pro­
vided.

judgment be also such that the defendants are subject to arrest thereon, 
the justice must further specify the names of those defendants served
with the summons, who may be arrested for want of property. 

SEC. 6665. A constable may, at his peril, omit to arrest a debtor,
or after arrest, suffer him to go at large before the return day, subiect

piration of thirty days.

SEc. 6667. 1'he affidavit of an imprisoned debtor, that he has a 
family for which he provides, specifying by name one or more persons,
members of such family. and the place of their residence, is sufficient 
evidence thereof to authorize his discharge by the jailer. 

SEC. 6668. A constable is liable to the party in whose favor an
execution issued to him for the amount thereof, in the following cases : 
1. Where he suffers thirty days to elapse without making a true return
thereof to the justice, and paying to him, or to the party entitled, the
money collected thereon by him. 
2. Where he willfully and carelessly omits to levy on property within
thirty days, or, if the defendant be liable to be imprisoned, then to ar­
rest and commit him to the jail of the county within thirty days. 

SEC. 6689. When an execution shaJl be returned unsatisfied for 
the want of goods and chattels, the justice shall, unless otherwise
directed by the party for whom the execution issued. commence an ac- 
tion on the undertaking for the stay of execution, and, so soon as judg-
ment is obtained thereon, shall issue execution, and if such execution
be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, for want of goods or chat-
tels of the bail whereon to levy, then the plaintiff may demand and
have execution on the original judgment, for the amount remaining 
due. 
SEC. 6670. Where Dail is given for the stay of execution. and the
defendant against whom the judgment was rendered shall die before 
the same is satisfied, the creditor may proceed against the surety in the
undertaking, in like manner as if execution had been issued against the 
defendant, and returned not satisfied for want of goods and chattels
whereon to levy. 

SEC. 6671. On the judgment against the defendant, in any civil
suit before a justice of the peace, when the defendant is in the custody

withstanding the execution of the undertaking to stay proceedings;
such security must be an undertaking executed to the plaintiff in error,
by at least two sufficient sureties, to the effect that if the judgment Le
reversed or modified he will make full restitution to the plaintiff in

of the plaintiff in error by sufficient surety, to the effect that the
plaintiff will pay all the costs which have accrued or may accrue on such
proceedings in error, together with the amount of any judgment that
may be rendered against such plaintiff in error, either on the further
trial of the cause, after the judgment of the court below is set aside or
reversed, or upon and after the affirmance thereof in the court of com­
mon pleas; when the judgment or final order of a justice, sought to
be reversed, directs the delivery of possession of real property, the
undertaking shall be in such sum as may he prescribed by the court of
common pleas, or a judge thereof, or, in the absence of such judge,
by the probate judge of the county, to the effect that, during the pos­
session of such property by the plaintiff in error, he will not commit,

ment be affirmed he will pay the value of the use and occupation of
the property from the date of the undertaking until the delivery of the
property, pursuant to the judgment, and costs; and the person entitled 
to such proceedings shall have the same time for prosecuting the same,

ment be paid off or satisfied prior to the commencement of such pro­ 
ceedings.

cause to the court below for such judgment; the district court or com­
mon pleas court so reversing a judgment shall, upon the request of
either party, specify in writing the ground or grounds of such reversal,
which shall be filed and kept with the papers in the case; the court re­
versing or affirming such judgment or final order shall not issue execu­
tion in causes that are so brought before it on error, on which it
pronounces judgment, as aforesaid, but shall send a special mandate to
the court below, as the case may require, for execution thereon, and
the court to which such special mandate is sent shall proceed in the
same manner as if such judgment or final order had been rendered
therein; and on motion, and good cause shown, it may suspend any
execution made returnable before it bv order of the court of common
pleas. the district court, or supreme court, in the same manner as if the
execution had heen issued from its own court; but such suspension

supreme court, as the case may be; but this section shall not apply to
judgments of justices of the peace.

nished, completed, or perfected, as they heretofore had under writs of 
error and certiorari. 
SEc. 6732. If the judgment of a justice of the peace, taken on 
error as herein provided to the court of common pleas, be affirmed,
such court shall render judgment against the plaintiff in error for the·
costs of suit, and award execution therefor; and the court shall there­
upon order its clerk to certify its decision to the justice, so that the
judgment affirmed may be enforced as if such proceedings in error
had not been taken; or, such court may award execution to carry into
effect the judgment of the justice, in the same manner as if the judg­
ment had been rendered in the court of common pleas. 

SEC. 6733. When the proceedings of a justice of the peace are
taken on error to the court of common pleas, in manner aforesaid, and 
the judgment of such justice is reversed or set aside, the court shall
render judgment of reversal, and for the costs that have accrued up to

for; and the cause, except when the reversal is because the justice had
no jurisdiction of the plaintiff in error, or of the subject of the action,
shall be retained by the court for trial and final judgment, as in cases 
of appeal.

SEC. 6742. The writ can only be issued by the supreme court or

exercise its judgment, or to proceed to the discharge of any of its func­
tions, it can not control judicial discretion. 
SEc. 6743. The application for the writ must be by petition, in the
name of the state, on the relation of the person applying, and verified
by affidavit; and the court may require a notice of the application to
be given to the defendant, or may grant an order to show cause why it
should not be al1owed, or may allow the writ without notice. 
SEC. 6744. The writ must not be issued in a case where there is a
plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. It may
issue on the information of the party beneficially interested. 

SEC. 6745. When the right to require the performance of the act
is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not per­
forming it, a court may, in the first instance, allow a peremptory man­
damus; and in all other cases an alternative writ must first he issued, 
on the allowance of the court, or a judge thereof. 
SEC. 6746. The allowance of the writ, and an order that the
defendant, immediately upon service, do the act required to be per­

not do the act, shall he entered on the journal. 
SEC. 6747. The writ shall be issued by the clerk of the court in
which the application is made, and shall contain a copy of the petition, 
verification, and order of allowance, and shall be served upon the
defendant, personally, by copy, by the sheriff of the proper county, or 
by a person specially authorized by the court or judge; such officer or
person shall report his proceedings therewith to the court; and if the
service be made by a person not an officer, the return must be verified 
by his affidavit.
SEC. 6748. On the return day of an alternative writ, or such fur-
ther day as the court may allow, the defendant may answer as in a civil 
action; or, if the writ be allowed by a single judge, he may demur.

new matter therein ; and the defendant may demur to the reply as in a 
civil action. 
SEC. 6750. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandamus must

civil actions. 
SEC. 6753. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, the relator may
recover the damages which he has sustained, to be ascertained by the 
court, or a jury, or by a referee or master, as in a civil action, and
costs; and a peremptory mandamus shall also be granted to him with- 
out delay.
SEC. 6754. Such recovery of damages against a defendant shall
be a bar to any other action upon such cause of action.
SEC. 6755. If judgment be given for the defendant, all costs shall
be adjudged against the relator. 
SEC. 6756. When a peremptory mandamus has been directed to a
public officer, body, or board, commanding the performance of a pub-
lic duty specially enjoined by law, and the court finds that such officer, 
or any member of such body or board, has, without just excuse, refused
or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a
fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon such officer or member;
and such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the
county wherein the duty ought to have been performed, and the pay-
ment thereof shall be a bar to an action for any penalty incurred by
such officer or member by reason of such refusal or neglect. 

SEC. 6157. When a peremptory mandamus has been awarded
against t e comrmssioners O a county, or t e trustees or oar O e u- 
cation of a township, or the council, trustees, or hoard of education of

debt, or to create a sinking fund for the payment of a funded debt, and
such officers ha ve resigned, or refuse or neglect to levy and assess such
tax, or their offices arc vacant, the court, upon the motion of an inter­
ested person. and upon being satisfied of the fact of such resignation,
vacancy. or refusal or neglect to levy such tax, and of the right of such
person to have the same levied and assessed, may cause a special order
to be issued to the auditor of the proper county, commanding him to
levy and assess upon the taxable property of the county, township. or
municipal corporation the taxes required by law, or the judgment or
order of said court, to be levied and assessed for the purposes aforesaid,
and to place the same upon the duplicate for collection by the county 
treasurer. 
SEC. 6758. When such special order is issued to the auditor he
shall be responsible for the execution thereof in the same manner as if
he were an officer of the court; and he shall receive such fees for his
services in executing the order, if not otherwise fixed by the court, as
he is allowed by law for making tax duplicates; which fees, and all other
costs of the proceeding. he shall add to the taxes levied in executing
such order, and place the same upou the duplicate for collection with
such taxes. 
SEc. 6759. The provisions of the last two sections shall not be
construed to limit the power of the court to carry its order and judg­
ment into execution, or to punish any officer named therein for con­
tempt or disobedience of its orders or writs.
