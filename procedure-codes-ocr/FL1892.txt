non-joinder or misjoinder, such non-joinder or misjoinder may be

amendment shall be made upon such terms as the court by whom
the amendment is made shall think proper; and in case it shall
appear at the trial of any action that there has been a misjoinder
of any defendants, such misjoinder may be amended at the trial
in like manner as the misjoinder of plaintiffs has been heretofore
directed to be amended, and upon such terms as the court by
whom such amendment is made shall think proper.

in such plea in abatement.

named in such plea in abatement and the plaintiff, be considered
for all persons as the commencement of the action

988. Effect of amendment after plea in abatement for nonjoinder of a defendant.—After such plea in abatement, and
amendment, if it shall appear upon the trial of the action that the
person so named in such plea in abatement was jointly liable
with the original defendant, the original defendant shall be entitled to the costs of such plea in abatement; but if at the trial
it shall appear that the original defendant is liable, but that one
or more of the person or persons named in such plea in abatement is or are not liable, the plaintiff shall nevertheless be entitled to judgment against the other defendant or defendants, who
shall appear to be liable; and every defendant who is not so liable shall have judgment, and shall be entitled to his costs
against the plaintiff, who shall be allowed the same, together with
the costs of the plea in abatement and amendment, as costs in the
cause against the original defendant or defendants who shall have
so pleaded in abatement the non-joinder of such person; but

the property shall have been replevied) for the amount or value
of the rental or advances, including interest and costs, and a writ
of execution shall issue thereon and be enforced as in other cases.

any part thereof be due in cotton or other agricultural products,
and the property distrained, or any of it, be of a similar kind to
that claimed in the affidavit, the Ptoperty of such similar kind,
up to a quantity to be judged of by the officer holding the execution, not exceeding that claimed in the affidavit, may be, at the
request of the plaintiff, delivered to the plaintiff as a payment on
his execution. ‘ '

When any property levied upon is sold, it shall be advertised
at least ten days, in the same manner as is provided by law for
the advertisement of personal property for sale under execution.
All property so levied upon may be sold on the leased premises,
or at the court-house door;

If the defendant shall, before the sale, appeal, and make such
appeal effectual as a supersedeas, and pay all costs accrued up to
the time that the supersedeas became operative, the property shall
be restored to him, and there shall be no sale.

In case any property be sold to satisfy any rent payable in
cotton or other agricultural product o_r thing, the officer shall

PROCEEDINGS BY THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

1781. Power of court to make parties.—In all proceedings
upon writs of quo warranto, or upon information in the nature of

such writs, or in civil actions instituted to obtain the remedies
obtainable by such proceedings, where the attorney-general institutes the action and does not make all the persons claiming
title to the ofhce parties, it shall be within the power of the court
to make parties defendant of all persons claiming the ofhce and
not made parties by the attorney-general. But the said persons
so desiring to be made parties shall be required to set forth by
petition under oath a prima facie case of right and title to the
oilice before the court can be required to make the order, and to
give security to the satisfaction of the court for the payment of
all costs which may be awarded against them.

PROCEEDINGS BY PERSONS OTHER THAN ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

1782. Right of claimant upon refusal of attorney-general.
—Any person claiming title to an oflice which is exercised by

another shall have the right, upon refusal by the attorney-gem
eral to institute proceedings in the name of the State upon such
claimant’s relation, or upon the attorney-general’s refusal to file
a complaint setting forth his name as the person rightfully entitled to the oiiice, to file an information, or institute an action in
the name of the State against the person exercising the oiiice,
setting up his own claim. In this case, the court is authorized
and required to determine the right of the claimant to the oihce
if he so desires. However, in this as well as in all other proceedings of this character, no person shall be adjudged entitled to
hold an oflice except upon full proof of his title to the office.

burden on respondent.——State, ex. rel. v. Saxon, 25 Fla.,3-12. Only attorne -general ean bring quo wan-auto against municipal corporations.—Robmson v. ones,

' 14 Fla., 256. Court cannot inquire into motive of attorney-general in filing.‘State v. Gleason, 12 Fla., 190. Writ issues upon demand of attorney-general.—Ib.

1783. Judgments in such suits.—In all cases where an individual institutes an action without the consent of the attorneygeneral, the judgment shall be conclusive as between the parties
other than the State; such judgment shall be no bar to any quo
warranto proceeding by the State, nor shall a judgment in such
proceeding instituted by the attorney—general be a bar to proceedings by any claimant other than the parties thereto. The party
recovering the judgment, shall however be entitled to exercise the
office until removed by quo war-ranto proceedings, or until his
right thereto shall otherwise cease.

Judgment of ouster, when rendered.--State ex. rel. v. Herndon, 23 Fla., 287.

When quo warranto 11es.—Lics as to franchises pertaining to private corporations..—Davidson v. State. ex. rel., 20 Fla., 784. Lies though relator have no

CONTROL OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL OVER ACTION.

1784. Power over dismissal.—-Where the attorney-general
institutes an action setting forth the name of the person rightfully entitled, or whenever there may be filed an information
upon the relation of a party claiming title, the attorney-general
shall not have the right to dismisssuch proceedings without the
consent of the claimant, but the court shall investigate the claim
and determine the right, if so desired by the person upon whose
relation the information is filed; and such claimant may have

counsel of his own choice to control the proceedings in his
behalf.

Power of circuit judge in vacation. Section . . . . . . . 1790
Penalty for disobedience of writ. Section . . . . . . . . 1791

PRACTICE AND PROCEEDINGS.

The practice in the courts of this State having jurisdiction to
issue writs of prohibition shall be as follows:

1785. Suggestion, and contents thereof.—The plaintiff or
plaintiffs shall file a suggestion stating the nature of the case,

and the proceedings in the inferior court, tribunal or body presuming to exercise jurisdiction, sought to be prohibited, concluding with a prayer for judgment, and that the State’s writ of prohibition may be granted in that behalf. When the matters.

suggested appear upon the face of the proceedings in the inferior
court, then the transcript of the record of all the proceedings in
the case, duly certified, shall accompany the suggestion, and
where the matters suggested are not matters of record, then the
truth thereof shall be verified by afhdavit of the party instituting
the proceedings, or of his agent or attorney-at-law or in fact.

1786. Rule—issuance,. effect and service.—-Upon the filing
-of the suggestion, the court, if in its judgment a prima facie case

is made, shall grant a rule directed to the inferior court and to
the parties plaintiff in the suit therein pending to show cause

‘ why the Writ of prohibition should not issue as prayed for. Such

rule shall be a .s~upe7'sedeas, and shall be served upon the inferior

court and the parties to whom it is directed at such time as the.

court may direct, and an answer or return shall be made thereto
by the inferior court and the parties at the time prescribed in the
rule. In case of failure to make such answer or return, it may
be enforced by attachment for contempt.

1787. Service of rule.——In all cases in which the plaintiff
in the inferior court is a non-resident of the county in which the
action or matter is pending, service of the rule may be made
upon his attorney-at-law in the pending suit or controversy, or
in such manner as may be prescribed by the court.

1788. Proceedings upon a.nswer.—Upon the filing of the
answer or return, the person prosecuting the writ may reply,
take issue or demur to the matters relied upon by such defendant, and the like proceedings (except in the matter of notices or
motions, and of the hearing) shall be had for the trial of issues
of law or fact, joined between the parties as in personal actions.

1789. Proceedings upon defa.u1t.——In case of default in
making answer or return, the party prosecuting the writ may,

instead of compelling an answer by attachment, have a hearing
upon the matter of suggestion, and the court, after hearing the
proof, shall render judgment either that a prohibition absolutely
do issue restraining the court and the parties from proceeding in
such action or matter, or that the proceedings be dismissed, in
which last event a copy of the judgment of dismissal shall be
certified to the inferior court.

POWER OF CIRCUIT JUDGES IN VACATION.

1790. Power to summon jury, etc.—-In cases arising in the
circuit court, all the proceedings, including the final judgment,

may be had before the judge either during term or in vacation,
and the courts before which such proceedings in prohibition are
instituted shall have power to summon a jury, in case it is necessary, in such manner as they may deem proper.
