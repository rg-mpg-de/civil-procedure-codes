as the original.
Sec. 70. In an action affecting the title or the right of possession
of real property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, and
the defendant, at the time of filing his answer, when affirmative relief
is claimed in such answer, or at any time afterwards, may record in
the office of the recorder of the county in which the property is situated,
a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the
parties and the object of the action or defence, and a description of the
property in that county affected thereby. From the time of filing such
notice for record only shall a purchaser or incumbrancer of the prop
erty affected thereby be deemed to have constructive notice of the
pendency of the action, and only of its pendency against parties desig
nated by their real names.
Sec. 71. The summons may be served by the sheriff of the county
where the defendant is found, or by any other person over the age of
eighteen, not a party to the action. When the summons is served by
the sheriff it must be returned, with his certificate of its service, and
of the service of any copy of the complaint, where such copy is served,
to the office of the clerk from which it issued. When it is served by
any other person it must be returned to the same place, with an affida
vit of such person of its service, and of the service of a copy of the
complaint, where such copy is served.
Sec. 72. The summons must be served by delivering a copy thereof,
as follows :
First. If the suit is against a corporation formed under the laws of
this Territory, to the president or other head of the corporation, secre
tary, cashier or managing agent thereof.
Second. If the suit is against a foreign corporation, or a non-resi
dent joint-stock company or association doing business and having a
managing or business agent, cashier, or secretary, within this Territory,
to such agent, cashier or secretary.
Third. If against a minor, under the age of fourteen years, residing
within this Territory, to such minor personally, and also to his father,
mother, or guardian ; or if there be none within this Territory, then to
any person having the care or control of such minor, or with whom he
resides, or in whose service he is employed.
Fourth. If against a person residing within this Territory, who has
been judicially declared of unsound mind, or incapable of conducting
his own affairs, and for whom a guardian has been appointed, to such
person, and also to his guardian.
Fifth. If against a county, city or town, to the president of the
board of supervisors, president of the council or trustees, or other head
of the legislative department thereof.
Sixth. In all other cases, to the defendant personally.
Sec. 73. Where the person on whom the service is to be made
resides out of the Territory, or has departed from the Territory, or
cannot after due diligence be found within the Territory, or conceals
himself to avoid the service of summons, or is a foreign corporation,
having no managing or business agent, cashier or secretary within the
Territory, and the fact appears by affidavit to the satisfaction of the
court or judge thereof, and it also appears by such affidavit, or by the
verified complaint on file, that a cause of action exists against the
defendant in respect to whom the service is to be made, or that he is a
necessary or proper party to the action, such court or judge may make
an order that the service be made by the publication of the summons.
Sec. 74. The order must direct the publication to be made in a
newspaper to be designated as most likely to give notice to the person
to be served, and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonableâ€”
at least once a week ; but publication against a defendant residing out
of the Territory, or absent therefrom, must not be less than four weeks.
In case of publication where the residence of a non-resident or absent
defendant is known, the court or judge must direct a copy of the
summons to be forthwith deposited in the post-office, directed to the
person to be served, at his place of residence. When publication is
ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint out
of the Territory is equivalent to publication and deposit in the postoffice
; and in either case the service of the summons is complete at the
expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.
Sec. 75. When the action is against two or more defendants jointly
or severally liable on a contract, and the summons is served on one or
more, but not on all of them, the plaintiff may proceed against the
defendant served in the same manner as if they were the only defen
dants.
Sec. 76. Proof of the service of summons must be as follows :
First. If served by the sheriff, his certificate thereof.
Second. If by any other person, his affidavit thereof ; or,
Third. In case of publication, the affidavit of the printer or his
foreman or principal clerk, showing the same ; and an affidavit of a
deposit of a copy of the summons in the post-office, if the same has
been deposited ; or,
Fourth. The written admission of the defendant.
Sec. 77. In case of service otherwise than by publication, the cer
tificate or affidavit must state the time and place of service.
Sec. 78. From the time of the service of the summons and of the
copy of the complaint in a civil action, where service of a copy of the
complaint is required, or of the completion of the publication when
service by publication is ordered, the court is deemed to have acquired
jurisdiction of the parties, and to have control of all the subsequent
proceedings. The voluntary appearance of a defendant is equivalent
to personal service of the summons upon him.

action arising also upon contract, and existing at the commencement
of the action.
Sec. 89. If the defendant omit to set up a counter claim in the

nor his assignee can afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff
therefor.
When cross demands have existed between persons under such cir
cumstances that if one had brought an action against the other a
counter claim could have been set up, neither shall be deprived of the
benefit thereof by the assignment or death of the other, but the two
demands shall be deemed compensated so far as they equal each other.
The defendant may set forth, by answer, as many defences and
counter claims as he may have ; they shall each be separately stated,

as provided in this section, except that when an admission of the truth
of the allegation might subject the party to a prosecution for felony or
misdemeanor, or when the action is by the district attorney, in behalf
of the Territory or county, the verification may be omitted. The
affidavit of verification shall state that the facts stated in the pleading
are true to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those
matters which are therein stated on his information and belief, and as
to those matters, that he believes it to be true. Such verification shall
be made by the party, or if there are several parties united in interest
or pleading, by one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts,
if such party is in the county and capable of making the affidavit.
The verification may also 'be made by the agent or attorney of the
party, if the party is absent from the county where the attorney resides,
or is from any other cause unable to verify the pleading, and in such
case the verification shall state that the affiant is the agent or attorney
of the party, and the reason why such verification is made by such
agent or attorney, and that the facts stated in the pleading are true to
the best knowledge, information and belief of such agent or attorney.
When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any
officer thereof, and shall state what officer he is, and that the facts
stated in the pleading are true to the best knowledge, information and
belief of such officer.
Sec. 95. When an action is brought upon a written instrument,
and the complaint contains a copy of such instrument, or a copy is
annexed thereto, the genuineness and due execution of such instrument
shall be deemed admitted, unless the answer denying the same shall
be verified.
Sec. 96. When the defence to an action is founded on a written
instrument, and a copy thereof is contained in the answer, or is
annexed thereto, the genuineness and due execution of such instru
ment are deemed admitted, unless the plaintiff file with the clerk,
within ten days after the filing of the answer, an affidavit denying the
same, and serve a copy thereof on the defendant.

preceding sections is not deemed admitted by a failure to deny the
same under oath, if the party desiring to controvert the same is, upon
demand, refused an inspection of the original.

Sec. 98. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of deter
mining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view
to^substantial justice between the parties.
Sec. 99. Sham and irrelevant answers, and irrelevant and redun
dant matter, inserted in a pleading may be stricken out upon such
terms as the court may in its discretion impose.
It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the
items of an account therein alleged ; but he shall deliver to the adverse
party, within five days after a demand therefor in writing, a copy of
the account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court,
or judge thereof, or probate judge, may order a further account when
the one delivered is too general, or is defective in any particular.
Sec. 100. In action for the recovery of real property, it must be
described in the complaint with such certainty as to enable an officer
upon execution to identify it.
Sec. 101. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a
court, or officer of especial jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determin
ation may be stated to have been duly given or made. If such
allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to
establish, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.
Sec. 102. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such per
formance, but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part ; and if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading shall establish, on the trial, the facts showing such
performance.
Sec. 108. In pleading the Statute of Limitations, it is not necessary
to state the facts showing the defence, but it may be stated generally
that the cause of action is barred by the provisions of sections
(giving the number of the section, and sub-division thereof, if it is so
divided, relied upon) of the Code of Civil Procedure ; and if such allega
tion be controverted, the party pleading must establish, on the trial,
the facts showing that the cause of action is so barred.
Sec. 104. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived there
from, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the
day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice
thereof.
Sec. 105. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing
the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which
the cause of action arose ; but it shall be sufficient to state generally
that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff ; and if
such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall establish, on the
trial, that it was so published or spoken.
Sec. 106. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defend
ant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount
of damages ; and whether he prove the justification or not, he may
give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
Sec. 107. Every material allegation of the complaint or answer not
controverted by the answer, or replication thereto, shall, for the pur
poses of the action, be taken as true. The statement in the replica
tion of matter in avoidance shall, on the trial, be deemed controverted
by the adverse party.
Sec. 108. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to
the claim or defence, and which could not be stricken from the plead
ing without leaving it insufficient.
Sec. 109. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed,
on motion, to make a supplemental complaint or answer, alleging facts
material to the case, occurring after the former complaint or answer.

CHAPTER VIII.
VARIANCEâ€”ERRORSâ€”AMENDMENTS.
Variance between pleadings and proofs.
Variance not material, power of court.
What variance deemed failure of proof
Pleadings amended once without costs.
Amendments on terms, judgment by mistake, etc.
In actions for recovery of personal property, when error in
stating value disregarded
WJien defendant may be sued by fictitious name.
Court may disregard errors not affecting substantial rights.
Sec. 1 10. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proofs is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the
adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defence
upon the merits. Where it appears that a party has been so misled,
the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as
may be just.
Sec. 111. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the
last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the
evidence, or may order an immediate amendment, without costs.
Sec. 112. Where, however, the allegation of the claim, or defence
to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or
particulars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be
deemed a case at variance within the last two sections, but a failure of
proofs.
Sec. 113. Any pleading may be amended once by the party of
course, and without costs, at any time before answer or demurrer filed,
and after the demurrer and before the trial of the issue of law thereon,
by filing the same as amended, and serving a copy on the adverse
party, who may have ten days thereafter in which to answer or demur
to the amended pleading.
Sec. 114. The court may, in furtherance of justice and on such
terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding, by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in
the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect ; and may, upon
like terms, enlarge the time for an answer, replication or demurrer, or
demurrer to an answer filed. The court may likewise, upon affidavit
showing good cause therefor, after notice to the adverse party, allow,
upon such terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in any other particulars ; and may, upon like terms, allow
an answer to be made after the time limited by this act ; and may,
upon such terms as may be just, and upon payment of costs, relieve
a party or his legal representatives from a judgment, order, or other
proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, sur
prise, or excusable neglect ; and when, for any cause satisfactory to
the court, or the judge at chambers, the party aggrieved has been
unable to apply for the relief sought, during the term at which such
judgment, order or proceeding complained of was taken, the court or
judge at chambers, in vacation, may grant the relief, upon application
made within a reasonable time, not exceeding five months after the
adjournment of the term. When, from any cause, the summons and
copy of the complaint in an action have not been personally served on
the defendant, the court may allow, on such terms as may be just, such
defendant or his legal representatives, at any time within l3ix months
after the rendition of any judgment in such action, to answer to the
merits of the original action.
Sec. 115. When, in an action to recover the possession of personal
property, the person making any affidavit did not truly state the value
of the property, and the officer taking the property, or the sureties on
any bond, are sued for taking the same, the officer or sureties may, in
their answer, set up the true value of the property, and that the per
son in whose behalf said affidavit was made was entitled to the posses
sion of the same when said affidavit was made ; or that the value in
the affidavit stated was inserted by mistake ; and the court shall disre
gard the value, as stated in the affidavit, and give judgment according
to the right of possession of said property at the time the affidavit was
made.
Sec. 116. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defend
ant, such defendant may be designated, in any pleading or proceed
ing, by any name ; and when his true name is discovered, the pleadings
or proceedings may be amended accordingly.
Sec. 117. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard
any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not
affect the substantial rights of the parties ; and no judgment shall be
reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.
Sec. 118. No person shall be arrested in a civil action, except as
prescribed in this act.
Sec. 119. The defendant may be arrested, as hereinafter prescribed,
in the following cases arising after the passage of this act :
First. In an action for the recovery of money or damages, on a
cause of action arising upon contract, express or implied, when the
defendant is about to depart from the Territory with intent to defraud
his creditors ; or when the action is for willful injury to person, to char
acter, or to property, knowing the property to belong to another.
Second. In an action for a fine or penalty ; or for money or property
embezzled, or fraudulently misapplied or converted to bis own use by
a public officer, or an officer of a corporation, or an attorney, factor,
broker, agent or clerk, in the course of his employment as such, or by
any other person in a fiduciary capacity ; or for misconduct or neglect
in office, or in a professional employment ; or for a willful violation of
duty.
Third. In an action to recover possession of personal property,
unjustly obtained, when the property, or any part thereof, has been con
cealed, removed or disposed of, so that it cannot be found or taken by
the sheriff.
Fourth. When the defendant has been guilty of fraud in contract
ing the debt, or incurring the obligation for which the action is brought,
or in concealing or disposing of the property, for the taking, detention
or conversion of which the action is brought.
Fifth. When the defendant has removed or disposed of his prop
erty, or is about to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors.
Sec. 120. An order for the arrest of the defendant shall be obtained
from a judge of the court in which the action is brought, or from a
probate judge.
Sec. 121. The order shall be made whenever it shall appear to the
judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff or some other person, that a suffi
cient cause of action exists, and that the case is one of those men
tioned in Section 119. Before making the order, the judge shall require
a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with at least two
sufficient sureties, to the effect that if the defendant recover judgment,
or if the court shall finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled to
an order of arrest, the plaintiff will pay all costs and charges that may
be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain
by reason of the wrongful suing out of the order of arrest, not exceed
ing the sum specified in the undertaking, which shall be at least five
hundred dollars.
Sec. 122. Each of the sureties shall annex to the undertaking an
affidavit that he is a resident and householder, or freeholder, within
the Territory, and worth double the sum specified in the undertaking,
over and above all his debts and liabilities, exclusive of property
exempt from execution. The undertaking shall be filed with the clerk
of the court.
Sec. 123. The order may be made to accompany the summons, or
at any time afterwards, before judgment. It shall require the sheriff
of the county where the defendant may be found, forthwith to arrest
him and hold him to bail in a specified sum, and to return the order
at a time therein mentioned to the clerk of the court in which the
action is pending.
Sec. 124. The order of arrest, with a ccpy of the affidavit upon
which it is made, shall be delivered to the sheriff, who, upon arresting
the defendant, shall deliver to him a copy of the affidavit, and also, if
desired, a copy of the order of arrest.
Sec. 125. The sheriff shall execute the order by arresting the
defendant and keeping him in custody until discharged by law : Pro
vided, That the sheriff shall not be bound to keep such person under
arrest more than twenty-four hours, unless the plaintiff advance each
day the expense of keeping such person, which expense shall be taxed
as costs in the action, and in no case shall be a charge against the
county.
Sec. 126. The defendant, at any time before execution, shall be
discharged from the arrest, either upon giving bail or upon depositing
the amount mentioned in the order of arrest, as provided in this chapter.
Sec. 127. The defendant may give bail by causing a written under
taking to be executed by two or more sufficient sureties, stating their
places of residence and occupations, to the effect that they are bound
m the amount mentioned in the order of arrest, that the defendant
shall at all times render himself amenable to the process of the court
during the pendency of the action, and to such as may be issued to
enforce the judgment therein ; or that they will pay to the plaintiff the
amount of any judgment which may be recovered in the action.
Sec. 128. At any time before judgment, or within ten days there
after, the bail may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or he
may surrender himself to the sheriff of the county where he was
arrested.
Sec. 129. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail,
at any time or place before they are finally charged, may themselves
arrest him, or by a written authority endorsed on a certified copy of
the undertaking, may empower the sheriff to do so. Upon the arrest
of the defendant by the sheriff, or upon his delivery to the sheriff by the
bail, or upon his own surrender, the bail shall be exonerated : Pro
vided, Such arrest, delivery, or surrender take place before the expira
tion of ten days after judgment ; but if such arrest, delivery or sur
render be not made within ten days after judgment, the bail shall be
finally charged on their undertaking, and be bound to pay the amount
of the judgment within ten days thereafter.
Sec. 180. If the bail neglect or refuse to pay the judgment within
ten days after they are finally charged, an action may be commenced
against such bail for the amount of such original judgment.
Sec. 181. The bail shall also be exonerated by the death of the
defendant, or his imprisonment in a territorial prison ; or by his legal
discharge from the obligation to render himself amenable to the pro
cess.
Sec. 182. Within the time limited for that purpose, the sheriff
shall file the order of arrest in the office of the clerk of the court
in which the action is pending, with his return endorsed thereon,
together with a copy or the undertaking of the bail. The original
undertaking he shall retain in his possession, until filed as herein pro
vided. The plaintiff, within ten days thereafter, may serve upon the
sheriff a notice that he does not accept the bail, or he shall be deemed
to have accepted them, and the sheriff shall be exonerated from
liability. If no notice be served within ten days, the original under
taking shall be filed with the clerk of the court.
Sec. 183. Within five days after receipt of notice, the sheriff or
defendant may give to the plaintiff, or his attorney, notice of the
justification of the same, or other bail (specifying the place of resi
dence and occupation of the latter), before a judge of the court, or
clerk thereof, or probate judge, at a specified time and place ; the
time to be not less than five nor more then ten days thereafter,
except by consent of parties. In case other bail be given, there

justification, may allow more than two sureties to justify severally,
in amounts less than that expressed in the order, if the whole
justification be equivalent to that of two sufficient bail.
Sec. 135. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail shall
attend before the judge or clerk, at the time and place mentioned in

of the deposit made, and the defendant shall be discharged out of

may be had on the official bond of the sheriff to collect the sum
deposited as in other cases of delinquency.
Sec. 139. If money be deposited as provided in the last two sections, bail may be given and may justify upon notice, at any
time before judgment; and on the filing of the undertaking and

favor of the defendant, the clerk shall, under the direction of the
court, refund him the whole sum deposited and remaining unap
plied.
Sec. 141. If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be
rescued, the sheriff shall himself be liable as bail, but he may dis
charge himself from such liability by the giving and justification of bail
at any time before judgment.
Sec. 142. If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff upon
his liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatis
fied in whole or in part, the same proceeding may be had on his
official bond, for the recovery of the whole or any deficiency, as in
other cases of delinquency.
Sec. 148. A defendant arrested may, at any time before justifica
tion of bail, apply to the judge who made the order, or the court in
which the action is pending, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff,
to vacate the order of arrest or to reduce the amount of bail. If
the application be made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant,
but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits,
or other proofs in addition to those on which the order of arrest
was made.

or attorney in the county, no such notice need be served.
Sec. 148. At the time and place specified in the notice, such
person shall be taken before such judge, who shall examine him
under oath, concerning his estate and property and effects, and the
disposal thereof, and his ability to pay the judgment for which he is
committed ; and such judge shall also hear any other legal and
pertinent evidence that may be produced by the debtor or creditor.
Sec. 149. If, upon examination, the judge be satisfied that the
prisoner' is entitled to his discharge, such judge shall administer to
him the following oath: . "I, , do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I have not any estate, real or personal, to the amount
of fifty dollars, except such as is by law exempted from being taken
on execution ; and that I have not any other estate now conveyed or
concealed, or in any way disposed of, with design to secure the same
to my use, or to defraud my creditors."
Sec. 150. After administering the oath, the judge shall issue an
order that the prisoner be discharged from custody, if he be imprisoned
for no other cause ; and the officer upon receiving service of such order,
shall discharge the prisoner forthwith, if he be imprisoned for no other
cause.
Sec. 151. If such judge should not discharge the prisoner, he may
apply for his discharge at the end of every succeeding ten days, in
the same manner as above provided, and the same proceedings shall
thereupon be had.
Sec. 152. The prisoner, after being so discharged, shall be for

Sec. 157. Upon receipt of the affidavit and notice, with a written
undertaking, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, approved by
the sheriff, to the effect that they are bound to the defendant in double
the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit, for the prosecution
of the action without delay and with effect, and for the return of the

shall be deemed to have waived all objections to them. When the
defendant excepts, the sureties shall justify on notice, in like manner
as upon bail on arrest ; and the sheriff shall be responsible for the
sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived,
as above provided, or until they justify. If the defendant except to
the sureties, he cannot reclaim the property, as provided in the next section.

or to the modification. All instructions given by the court must be
filed together with those refused, as a part of the record. If any party

verdict, or are discharged by the court. The officer shall, to the

having them in possession ; and they may also take with them notes of
the testimony or other proceedings on the trial taken by themselves, or
any of them, but none taken by any other person.

court, in case of an agreement during a recess or adjournment for the
day. A final adjournment of the court for the term shall discharge
the jury.

be conducted into court, their names called by the clerk, and their ver
dict rendered by their foreman. The verdict must be in writing, signed
hy the foreman, and must be read by the clerk to the jury, and the
inquiry made whether it is their verdict. If any jurors disagree, they
must be sent out again ; but if no disagreement be expressed, and
neither party requires the jury to be polled, the verdict is complete and
the jury discharged from the case. Either party may require the jury
to be polled, which is done by the court or clerk asking each juror if it
is his verdict. If any one answers in the negative the jury must again
be sent out.
Sec. 262. If the verdict be informal or insufficient in not covering
the whole issue or issues submitted, or in any particular, the verdict
may be corrected by the jury under the advice of the court, or the jury
may be again sent out.
Sec. 263. If the jury are permitted to separate, either during the
trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admonished
by the court that it is their duty not to converse with or suffer them
selves to be addressed by any other person on the subject of the trial,
and that it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon until
the case is finally submitted to them.
Sec. 264. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. A gen
eral verdict is that by which they pronounce generally upon all or any
of the issues, either in favor of plaintiff or defendant ; a special verdict
is that by which the jury finds the facts only, leaving the judgment to
the court. The special verdict shall present the conclusion of fact as
established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them ; and
those conclusions of fact shall be so presented as that nothing shall
remain to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.
Sec. 265. In an action for the recovery of money only, or specific
property, the jury, in their discretion may render a general or special
verdict. In all other cases the court may direct the jury to find a
special verdict in writing upon all or any of the issues ; and in all cases
may instruct them, if they render a general verdict, to find upon par
ticular questions of fact, to be stated in writing, and may direct a writ
ten finding thereon. The special verdict or finding shall be filed with
the clerk and entered upon the minutes. Where a special finding of
facts shall be inconsistent with the general verdict the former shall
control the latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.
Sec. 266. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an action for
the recovery of money, or for the defendant when a counter claim for
the recovery of money is established, exceeding the amount of the
plaintiff's claim as established, the jury shall also find the amount of
the recovery.
Sec. 267. In an action for the recovery of specific personal property,
if the property has not been delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant
by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury, if their verdict be in
favor of the plaintiff, or if, being in favor of the defendant, they also
find that he is entitled to a return thereof, shall find the value of the
property (but failure to find all the facts mentioned in this section shall
not invalidate the verdict), and may at the same time assess the dam
ages, if any are claimed in the complaint or answer, which the prevail
ing party has sustained by reason of the taking or detention of such
property.
Sec. 268. Upon receiving a verdict an entry shall be made by the
clerk in the minutes of the court, specifying the time of trial, the names
of the jurors and witnesses, and the verdict ; and where a special ver
dict is found, either the judgment rendered thereon, or if the case be
reserved for argument or further consideration, the order thus reserv
ing it.
Sec. 269. Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties to an
issue of fact in actions arising on contract or for the recovery of specific
real or personal property with or without damages, and with the assent
of the court, in other actions, in manner following :
First. By failing to appear at the trial.
Second. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the
clerk.
Third. By oral consent, in open court, entered in the minutes.
Sec. 270. Upon a trial of issue of fact by the court, judgment shall
be entered in accordance with the finding of the court, and the finding,
if required by either party, shall be reduced to writing and filed with
the clerk. In the finding filed, the facts found and the conclusions
of law shall be separately stated. In such cases no judgment shall be
reversed on appeal, for want of a finding in writing, at the instance of
any party who at the time of the submission of the â€¢ cause shall not
have requested a finding, in writing, and had such request entered in
the minutes of the court ; nor in cases tried by the court, by a com
missioner, or a referee, shall the judgment be reversed on appeal, for
defects in the finding ; and in cases of exceptions for defective findings,
the particular point or issue upon which the party requires a finding
to be made, or the particular defect to be remedied, shall be specific
ally and particularly designated; and upon failure of the court to
remedy, or, when tried by a commissioner or referee, to cause to be
remedied by such commissioner or referee, the alleged defect, the party
moving shall be entitled to his exceptions, and the same shall be set
tled by the judge as in- other cases: Provided, That such exceptions
shall be filed in the court and served on the attorney of the adverse party
within five days after receiving from or giving to the adverse party
written notice of the filing and finding: Provided, That when any
cause is tried and submitted upon a written statement of facts agreed to
by the parties or their attorneys, such statement shall have the effect
of a special verdict or finding of facts, and judgment shall be pronounced
thereon as upon a special verdict or finding of facts ; and in such case
no finding of facts shall be made unless such statement shall fail to
embrace all the facts proved and in issue, in which case any additional
fact may be found upon evidence which is not repugnant to the agreed
statement.
Sec. 271. On a judgment upon an issue of law, if the taking of an
account be necessary to enable the court to complete the judgment, a
reference may be ordered.
Sec. 272. On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an issue of law, he
may proceed in the manner prescribed by the first two sub-divisions of Section 286, upon the failure of defendant to answer. If judgment be
for the defendant upon an issue of law, and the taking of an account or
the proof of any fact be necessary to enable the court to complete the
judgment, a reference may be ordered as in that section provided.
Sec. 273. A reference may be ordered upon the agreement of the
parties, filed with the clerk or entered on the minutes :
First. To try any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,
whether of fact or of law, and to report a finding and judgment thereon.
Second. To ascertain a fact necessary to enable the court to proceed
and determine a case.
Sec. 274. When the parties do not consent the court may, upon
application of either, or of its own motion, direct a reference in the fol
lowing cases :
First. When the trial of an issue of fact requires the examination of
a long account on either side ; in which case the referees may be directed
to hear and decide the whole issue, or report upon any specific question
of fact involved therein.
Second. When the taking of an account is necessary for the infor
mation of the court before judgment, or for carrying a judgment or
order into effect.
Third. When a question of fact other than upon the pleading arises,
upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the action.
Fourth. When it is necessary for the information of the court in a
special proceeding.
Sec. 275. A reference may be ordered to any person or persons, not
exceeding three, agreed upon by the parties. If the parties do not
agree, the court or judge shall appoint one or more referees, not exceed
ing three, who reside in the county where the action or proceeding is
triable, and against whom there is no legal objection, or the reference
may be made to a court commissioner of the county where the cause
is pending. Every referee, before acting as such, shall take and sub
scribe an oath (or affirmation), before some authorized officer, which
shall be filed with the clerk of the court by which he is appointed, that
he will honestly, impartially and faithfully perform the duties of
referee in the action or matter referred to him, as required by law, to
the best of his knowledge and ability.
Sec. 276. Either party may object to the appointment of any per
son as referee on one or more of the following grounds :
First. A want of any of the qualifications prescribed by statute to
render a person competent as a juror.
Second. Consanguinity or affinity within the third degree to either
party.
Third. Standing in the relation of guardian and ward, master and
servant, employer and clerk, or principal and agent, to either party, or
being a member of the family of either party, or a partner in Dusiness
with either party, or being security on any bond or obligation for either
party.
Fourth. Having served as a juror or been a witness on any trial
between the same parties for the same cause of action.
Fifth. Interest on the part of such person in the event of the
action, or in the main question involved in the action.
Sixth. Having formed or expressed an unqualified opinion or belief
as to the merits of the action.
Seventh. The existence of a state of mind in such person evincing
enmity against or bias to either party.
Sec. 277. The objection taken to the appointment of any person as
referee shall be heard and disposed of by the court. Affidavits may be
read and any person examined as a witness as to such objections.
Sec. 278. The referees or commissioner shall report their findings in
writing to the court within ten days (or within such further time as may
be allowed by the court) after the testimony shall have been closed and
the facts found, and the conclusions of law shall be separately stated
therein. The finding of the referees or commissioner upon the whole
issue shall stand as the finding of the court, and upon filing of the
finding with the clerk of the court judgment may be entered thereon in
the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court. The
finding of the referees or commissioner may be excepted to and
reviewed in like manner as if made by the court. When the reference
is to report the facts, the finding reported shall have the effect of a
special verdict.

and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved, for
any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights
of said party :
First. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse

either party was prevented from having a fair trial.
Second. Misconduct of the jury ; and whenever any one or more of
the jurors shall have been induced to assent to any general or spe

to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance,
such misconduct may be proved by the affidavits of any one or more of
the jurors.
Third. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not
have guarded against.
Fourth. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making
the application.
Sec. 286. When the application is made for a cause mentioned
in the first, second, third, and fourth subdivisions of the last section,
it must be made upon affidavits ; for any other cause it may be
made at the option of the moving party, either upon the minutes
of the court, or a bill of exceptions, or a statement of the case pre
pared as hereinafter provided.
Sec. 287. The party intending to move for a new trial must, within
ten days after the verdict of the jury, if the action was tried by a jury, or
after notice of the decision of the court or referee, if the action was
tried without a jury, file with the clerk and serve upon the adverse
party a notice of his intention, designating the grounds upon which
the motion will be made, and whether the same will be made upon
affidavits or the minutes of the court, or a bill of exceptions, or a
statement of the case :
First. If the motion is to be made upon affidavits, the moving
party must, within ten days after serving the notice, or such further
time as the court in which the action is pending or a judge thereof may
allow, file such affidavits with the clerk and serve a copy upon the

of which must be served upon the moving party.
Second. If the motion is to be made upon a bill of exceptions and
no bill has already been settled as hereinbefore provided, the moving
party shall have the same time after service of the notice to prepare
and obtain a settlement of a bill of exceptions as is provided after the
entry of judgment, or after receiving notice of such entry provided by section 281, and the bill shall be prepared and settled in a similar man
ner. If a bill of exceptions has heen already settled and filed when
the notice of motion is given, such bill shall be used on the motion.
Third. If the motion is to be made upon a statement of the case,
the moving party must, within ten days after the service of the notice,

court for the judge ; and thereupon the same proceedings for the set
tlement of the statement shall be taken by the parties and clerk and
judge as are required for the settlement of bills of exceptions by section
281. If the action was heard by a referee, the same proceedings shall
be had for the settlement of the statement by him as are required by that section for the settlement of bills of exception by a referee. If no
amendments are served within the time designated, or, if served, are
allowed, the proposed statement and amendments, if any, may be pre

excepted to by the moving party, the statement shall specify the par
ticular errors upon which the party will rely. If no such specifications
be made, the statement shall be disregarded on the hearing of the
motion. It is the duty of the judge or referee, in settling the state
ment, to strike out of it all redundant and useless matter, and to make
the statement truly represent the case, notwithstanding the assent of
the parties to such redundant or useless matter, or to any inaccurate
statement. When settled, the statement shall be signed by the judge
or referee, with his certificate to the effect that the same is allowed,
and shall then be filed with the clerk.
Fourth. When the motion is to be made upon the minutes of the
court, and the ground of the motion is the insufficiency of the evidence
to justify the verdict or other decision, the notice of motion must
specify the particulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insuffi
cient, and if the ground of the motion be errors in law occurring at the
trial and excepted to by the moving party, the notice must specify the

earliest practicable period after the notice of the motion, if the
motion is to be heard upon the minutes of the court, and in other
cases after the affidavits, bills of exception, or statement, as the
case may be, are filed, and may be brought to a hearing upon
motion of either party. On such hearing, reference may be had in all

edgment, or make such endorsement, and upon motion, the court may
compel it, or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it.
Sec. 800. A transcript of any judgment rendered by any justice of
the peace, duly certified by said justice, may be filed with the recorder
of the county in which such judgment shall have been rendered, and

require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment with interest, out of the
personal property of such debtor ; and if sufficient personal property

court : Provided, Such homestead shall not exceed in value the sum of

construed as to affect any existing debt or debts contracted in this Ter
ritory prior to the passage of this act.

purpose whatever : Provided, That this act shall not be so construed
as to in any manner relate to judgments or decrees rendered on the
foreclosure of mortgages either equitable or legal.
Sec. 318. On the death of the owner of such homestead, the same
shall descend to his widow, and she shall take and hold the same

ing the other property, and paying to the plaintiff or his attorney so
much of the proceeds as will satisfy the judgment. Any excess of the
proceeds over the judgment and accruing costs must be returned to the
judgment debtor, unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of
the court. When there is more property of the judgment debtor than
is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs within the view
of the sheriff, he must levy only on such part of the property as the
judgment debtor may indicate, if the property indicated be amply
sufficient to satisfy the judgment and costs.

notice in three public places in the township or city where the sale is to
take place not less than five nor more than ten days successively.

ticularly describing the property, for twenty days successively, in three
public places of the township or city where the property is situated,
and also where the property is to be sold, and publishing a brief notice
of such sale once a week for the same period in some newspaper pub
lished in the county, if there be one, which notice shall be substantially
as follow8 :
John Doe ) sheriff's sale.
vs.
Richard Eoe.
To be sold at sheriff's sale on the â€”day of , 187â€”, at
[Here insert a brief description of property.] Signed,
John Doe, Sheriff'.
Any sheriff publishing a notice not in accordance with this form, and
which shall cost more than such a notice, shall not be entitled to any
costs for the publication of the same, but shall be personally liable for
the payment of such publication.
Sec. 322. An officer selling without the notice prescribed by the
last section shall forfeit five hundred dollars to the aggrieved party, in

the judgment (if the judgment be satisfied before sale), shall forfei five
hundred dollars.
Sec. 823. All sales of property under execution shall be made at
auction to the highest bidder, and shall be made between the hours of
nine in the morning and five in the afternoon. After sufficient property
has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold. Neither
the officer holding the execution nor his deputy shall become a pur
chaser or be interested in any purchase at such sale. When the sale is
of personal property capable of manual delivery, it shall be within view
of those that attend the sale, and be sold in such parcels as are likely
to bring the highest price ; and when the sale is of real property, and
consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately,
or when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person,
and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion shall be thus sold.
The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may also direct the order
in which property, real or personal, shall be .sold when such property
consists of several known lots or parcels, or of articles which can be
sold to advantage separately ; and the sheriff shall be bound to follow
such directions.
Sec. 324. If a purchaser refuse to pay the amount bid by him for
property struck off to him at a sale under execution, the officer may
again sell the property at any time to the highest bidder, and if any
loss be occasioned thereby the officer may recover the amount of such
loss, with costs, from the bidder so refusing, in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
Sec. 825. When a purchaser refuses to pay, the officer may, in his
discretion, thereafter reject any subsequent bid of such person.
Sec. 326. The two preceding sections shall not be construed to
make the officer liable for any more than the amount bid by the second
or subsequent purchaser and the amount collected from the purchaser
refusing to pay.
Sec. 327. When the purchaser of any personal property capable of
manual delivery shall pay the purchase money, the officer making the
sale shall deliver to the purchaser the property, and, if desired, shall
execute and deliver to him a certificate of the sale and payment. Such
certificate shall convey to the purchaser all the right, title, and interest
which the debtor had in and to such property on the day the execution
was levied.
Sec. 328. When the purchaser of any personal property not capa
ble of manual delivery shall pay the purchase money, the officer mak
ing the sale shall execute and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of
sale and payment. Such certificate shall convey to the purchaser all
right, title and interest which the debtor had in and to such property
on the day the execution was levied.
Sec. 329. Upon a sale of real property the purchaser shall be sub
rogated to and acquire all the right title, and interest and claim of the
judgment debtor therein, and when the estate is less than a leasehold
of two years' unexpired term the sale shall be absolute ; in all other
cases the property shall be subject to redemption as provided in this chapter. The officer shall give to the purchaser a certificate of sale,
containingâ€”
First. A particular description of the reiil property sold.
Second. The price bid for each distinct lot or parcel.
Third. The whole price paid.
Fourth. When subject to redemption it shall be so stated.
A duplicate of such certificate shall be filed by the officer in the office
of the recorder of the county.
Sec. 330. Property sold subject to redemption, as provided in the
last section, or any part separately, may be redeemed in the manner
hereinafter provided, by the following persons or their successors in
interest :
First. The judgment debtor or his successor in interest in the whole
or in any part of the property.
Second. A creditor having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the
property sold, or on some share or part thereof, subsequent to that on
which the property was sold.
The persons mentioned in the second sub-division of this section are
in this chapter termed redemptioners.
Sec. 331. The judgment debtor, or redemptioner, may redeem the
property from the purchaser any time within six months after the sale,
on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with two per
cent, a month thereon in addition up to the time of redemption,
together with the amount of any assessment or taxes which the pur
chaser may have paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such
amount, and if the purchaser be also a creditor, having a prior lien to
that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such
purchase was made, the amount of such lien, with interest.
Sec. 332. If the property be so redeemed by a redemptioner, another
redemptioner may, within sixty days after the last redemption, again
redeem it from the last redemptioner, on paying the sum paid on such
last redemption, with four percent, thereon in addition, and the amount
of any assessment or taxes which the last redemptioner may have
paid thereon after the redemption by him, with interest on such amount,
and in addition to the amount of any liens held by said last redemp
tioner prior to his own, with interest ; but the judgment under which
the property was sold need not be so paid as a lien.
The property may be again, and so often as a redemptioner is so
disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner, within sixty days
after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous
redemption, with four per cent, thereon in addition, and the amount of
any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after
the redemption by him, with interest thereon, and the amount of any
liens, other than the judgment under which the property was sold,
held by the last redemptioner previous to his own, with interest.
Written notice of redemption must be given to the sheriff, and a
duplicate filed with the recorder of the county ; and if any taxes or
assessments are paid by the redemptioner, or if he has or acquires any
lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice
thereof must in like manner be given to the sheriff and hied with the
recorder ; and if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed
without paying such tax, assessment, or lien. If no redemption be
made within six months after the sale, the purchaser or his assignee is
entitled to a conveyance ; or, if so redeemed, whenever sixty days have
elapsed and no other redemption has been made, and notice thereof
given, and the time for redemption has expired, the last redemptioner
or assignee is entitled to a sheriff's deed ; but in all cases the judgment
debtor shall have the entire period of six months from the date of the
sale to redeem the property. If the judgment debtor redeem he must
make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a
redemptioner. If the debtor redeem, the effect of the sale is termi
nated, and he is restored to his estate. Upon a redemption by the
debtor, the person to whom the payment is made must execute and
deliver to him a certificate of redemption, acknowledged or proved
before an officer authorized to take acknowledgment of conveyances of
real property. Such certificate must be filed and recorded in the office
of the recorder of the county in which the property is situated, and the
recorder must note the record thereof in the margin of the record of the
certificate of such sale.
Sec. 333. The payments mentioned in the last two sections may be
made to the purchaser or redemptioner, as the case may be, or for
him, to the officer who made the sale, or, in case his term of office has
expired, then to his successor in office ; and in all cases when, under
the provisions of this act, a purchaser of property at execution sale
shall be entitled to a conveyance of the same, such conveyance shall
be executed to him by the officer who made the sale, if he still be in
office, but in case the officer who made the sale be not in such office at
the time the purchaser may be entitled to such conveyance, then the
conveyance shall be executed by his successor in office.
Sec. 334. A redemptioner shall produce to the officer or person
from whom he seeks to redeem, and serve with his notice to the sheriff :
First. A copy of the docket of the judgment under which he claims
the right to redeem, certified by the clerk of the court or of the county
where the judgment is docketed ; or, if he redeem upon a mortgage or
other lien, a note of the record thereof certified by the recorder.
Second. A copy of any Assignment necessary to establish his claim,
verified by the affidavit of himself, or of a subscribing witness thereto ;
and,
Third. An affidavit by himself or his agent, showing the amount
then actually due on the lien.
Sec. 335. Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption,
the court may restrain the commission of waste on the property, by
order granted, with or without notice, on the application of the pur
chaser or the judgment creditor. But it shall not be deemed waste for
the person in possession of the property at the time of sale, or entitled
to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to
continue to use it, in the same manner in which it was previously
used ; or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry ; or to make the
necessary repairs of buildings thereon ; or to use wood or timber on the
property therefor, or for the repair of fences, or for fuel for his family
while he occupies the property.
Sec. 336. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his
successor in interest, be evicted therefrom, in consequence of irregular
ities in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or
discharge of the judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest,
from the judgment creditor. If the purchaser of property at sheriff's
sale, or his successor in interest, fail to recover possession, in conse
quence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale, or
because the property sold was not subject to execution and sale, the
court having jurisdiction thereof shall, on petition of such party in
interest, or his attorney, revive the original judgment for the amount
paid by such# purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from the
time of payment at the same rate that the original judgment bore ; and,
when so revised, the said judgment shall have the same effect as an
original judgment of the said court of that date, and bearing interest
as aforesaid ; and any other or after acquired property, rents, issues,
or profits of the said debtor shall be liable to levy and sale under exe
cution, in satisfaction of such debt : Provided, That no property of
such debtor, sold bona fide before the filing of such petition, shall be
subject to lien of said judgment : And provided, further, That notice
of the filing of such petition shall be made by filing a notice thereof in
the recorder's office of the county where such property may be situated,
and that said judgment shall be revived in the name of the original
plaintiff or plaintiffs, for the use of said petitioner, the party in interest.
Sec. 337. When property liable to an execution against several
persons is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judg
ment is satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of property of one of
them, or one of them pays, without a sale, more than his proportion,
he may compel contribution from the others ; and when a judgment is
against several, and is upon an obligation of one of them, as security
for another, and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either
by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel re-payment from
the principal. In such case the person so paying or contributing is
entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or re
payment, if, within ten days after his payment, he file with the clerk
of the court where judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and
claim to contribution or re-payment. Upon a filing of such notice, the
clerk must make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket.
Sec. 338. When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or any of the several debtors in the same judgment, issued to
the sheriff of the county where he resides, or, if he does not reside in
this Territory, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment roll
is filed, is returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the judgment credi
tor, at any time after such return is made, shall be entitled to an order
from the judge of the court, or probate judge, requiring such judgment
debtor to appearand answer concerning his property, before such judge,
or a referee appointed by him, at a time and place specified in the order ;
but no judgment debtor shall be required to attend before a judge or
referee, out of the county in which he resides, when proceedings are
taken under the provisions of this chapter.
Sec. 339. After issuing an execution against property, and upon
proof by affidavit by a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court,
or a judge thereof, that any judgment debtor has property which he
unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment,
such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to
appear at a specified time and place, before such judge or referee
appointed by him, to answer concerning the same ; and such proceed
ings may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the
judgment debtor towards the satisfaction of the judgment as are pro
vided upon the return of an execution. Instead of the order requiring
the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may, upon affidavit
of the judgment creditor, his agent or attorney, if it appear to him that
there is danger of the debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the
debtor, and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought before
the judge he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, with surety,
that he will attend from time to time before the judge or referee, as shall
be directed, during the pendency of the proceedings, and until the final
determination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose of any por
tion of his property not exempt from execution. In default of entering
into such undertaking he may be committed to prison.
Sec. 340. After the issuing of an execution against property, and
before its return, any person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay
to the sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as may be
necessary to satisfy the execution, and the sheriff's receipt is a sufficient
discharge for the amount so paid.
Sec. 341. After the issuing or return of an execution against property
of a judgment debtor, or any one of several debtors in the same
judgment, and upon proof, by affidavit or otherwise, to the satisfaction
of the judge, that any person or corporation has property of such judg
ment debtor, or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding fifty dollars,
the judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation, or any
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place before
him, or a referee appointed by him, and answer concerning the same.
The judge may also, by order, forbid a transfer or 6ther disposition
of the property of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, and
any interference therewith.
Sec. 342. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify before the
judge or referee, upon any proceeding under this chapter, in the same
manner as upon trial of an issue.
Sec. 343. The judge or referee may order any property of the judg
ment debtor not exempt from execution, in the hands of such debtor,
or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied
towards the satisfaction of the judgment; except, that the earn
ings of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within thirty
days next preceding the order, shall not be so applied, when it shall be
made to appear by the debtor's affidavit, or otherwise, that such earn
ings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly by
his labor.
Sec. 344. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest
in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, the court or judge
may authorize, by an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor
to institute an action against such person or corporation, for the
recovery of such interest or debt. And the court or judge may, by
order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt,
until an action can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment. Such
order may be modified or vacated by the judge granting the same, or by
the court in which the action is brought, at any time, upon such terms
as may be just.
Sec. 345. If any person, party or witness disobey an order of the
referee properly made, in the proceeding before him, under this chapter,
he may be punished by the court or judge ordering the reference, for a
contempt.
Sec. 346. There shall be but one action for the recovery of any debt,
or the enforcement of any rights, secured by mortgage upon real estate
or personal property, which action shall be in accordance with the pro
visions of this chapter. In action for the foreclosure of mortgages, the
court shall have the power, by its judgment, to direct a sale of the
incumbered property (.or as much as may be necessary), and the
application of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the costs of
the court, and expenses of the sale, and the amount due to the plain
tiff ; and if it appear from the sheriff's return that the proceeds are
insufficient, and a balance still remains due, judgment shall be dock
eted for such balance against the defendant, or defendants, person
ally liable for the debt, and shall then become a lien on the real estate
of such judgment debtor, as in other cases in which execution may be
issued. No person holding a conveyance from or under the mortgagor,
or of the property mortgaged, or having a lien thereon, which convey
ance does not appear on record in the proper office at the time of the
commencement of the action, need be made a party to such action ;
and the judgment therein rendered, and the proceedings therein had,
shall be as conclusive against the party holding such unrecorded con
veyance or lien, as if he had been made a party to said action, and shall,
in all respects, have the same force and effect.
Sec. 347. If there be surplus money remaining after payment of the
amount due on the mortgage, lien, or incumbrance, with costs, the
court may cause the same to be paid to the person entitled to it, and
in the meantime may direct it to be deposited in court.
Sec. 318. If the debt for which the mortgage, lien or incumbrance
is held be not all due, so soon as sufficient of the property has been sold
to pay the amount due, with costs, the sale shall cease ; and afterwards,
as often as more becomes due for principal or interest, the court may,
on motion, order more to be sold. But if the property can not be sold
in portions without injury to the parties, the whole may be ordered to
be sold in the first instance, and the entire debt and costs paid, there
being a rebate of interest where such rebate is proper.

liable to the owner of such land, or to such city or town, for treble the
amount of damages which may be assessed therefor, in a civil action in
any court having jurisdiction.

property.
. Sec. 357. When damages are claimed for withholding the property

The court in which an action is pending for the recovery of real
property or for damages for an injury thereto, or a judge thereof, or a
county judge, may, on motion, upon notice by either party, for good
cause shown, grant an order allowing to such party the right to enter

even though entry for such purpose has to be made through other
lands belonging to parties to the action.

real property as parceners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, in

persons for a partition thereof, according to the respective rights of
the persons interested therein, and for a sale of such property or a
part thereof, if it appear that a partition cannot be made without
great prejudice to the owners.
Sec. 365. The interest of all such persons in the property, whether
such persons be known or unknown, shall be set forth in the complaint
specifically and particularly, as far as known to the plaintiff, and
if one or more of the parties, or the share or quantity of interest of
any of the parties, be unknown to the plaintiff, or be uncertain or con

several counties, in which the property is situated, either a copy of
such complaint or a notice of the pendency of the action, containing
the names of the parties so far as Known, the object of the action, and
a description of the property to be affected thereby. From the time
of the filing it shall be deemed notice to all persons.
Sec. 368. The summons shall be directed to all the joint tenants

persons unknown who have or claim any interest in the property.
Sec. 369. If a party having a share or interest is unknown, or any

the subject of the action.

sale shall be made, and where service of the complaint has been made
by publication, like proof shall be required of the right of absent or
unknown parties before such judgment is rendered, except that where
there are several unknown persons having an interest in the property
their rights may be considered together in the action, and not as
between themselves.
Sec. 872. Whenever, from any cause, it shall become, in the opinion
of the court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to make a complete
partition in the first instance, among all the parties in interest, it shall
be lawful for the court to first ascertain and determine the shares or
interest respectively held by the original co-tenants, and thereupon to
adjudge and cause a partition to be made, as if such original co-tenants
were the parties and sole parties in interest, and the only parties to
the action, and therefore proceed in like manner to adjudge and make
partition separately of each share of partition so ascertained and
allotted, as between those claiming under the original tenant to whom
the same shall have been so set apart, or allow them to remain tenants
in common thereof, as they may desire.
Sec. 373. If it shall appear to the court by the certificate of the

as provided in the last section, on each person having outstanding
liens of record who is not a party to the action, to appear before the
referee at a specified time and place, to make proof by his own affidavit
or otherwise of the true amount due, or to become due, contingently or
absolutely, thereon. In case such person be absent or his residence be
unknown, service may be made by publication, or notice to his agents,
under the direction of the court, in such manner as may be proper.
The report of the referee thereon shall be made to the court, and shall
be confirmed, modified, or set aside, and a new reference ordered, as
the justice of the case may require.
Sec. 375. If it be alleged in the complaint, and be established by
evidence; or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation in the
complaint, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property, or any
part of it, is so situated that partition cannot be made without great
prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof ; otherwise,
upon the requisite proof being made, it shall order a partition accord
ing to the respective rights of the parties as ascertained by the court,
and appoint three referees therefor, and shall designate the portion to
remain undivided for the owners whose interests are remaining
unknown, or are not ascertained.

specifying therein the manner of executing their trusts, describing the
property divided and the shares allotted to each party, with a particular
description of each share.
Sec. 378. If no exceptions be filed to the report, or upoa hearing
they should be overruled, the court shall confirm the same ; or it may,
upon exceptions, change, modify, or set it aside, and refer the matter
to the same, or, if necessary, may appoint new referees. Upon the
report, as confirmed, a final judgment shall be rendered, to the effect
that such partition be effectual and valid forever, which judgment shall
be binding and conclusive :
First. On all persons named in the complaint as parties to the
action, or who shall have appeared therein, and their legal representa
tives, who have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any
part thereof, as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years, or as
entitled to the reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of such prop
erty, or any part thereof, after the termination of a particular estate
therein, and who, by any contingency, may be entitled to a beneficial
interest in the property, or who have an interest in any undivided share
thereof as tenants for years or for life.
Second. On all persons interested in the property, who may be
unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of the action by publi

Third. On all persons claiming from such parties or persons, or
either of them, and to that end the action shall be deemed, and is
hereby declared, to be a proceeding in rem.

copy of the final judgment therein rendered, duly certified, may be

for years, less than ten, to the whole of the property which is the
subject of the partition.
Sec. 380. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor
and his assistant or assistants, when employed, shall be ascertained
and allowed by the court, and the amount thereof, together with the
fees allowed by the court, in its discretion, to the referees, shall be
apportioned among the different parties to the action equitably.
Sec. 381. When a lien is on an undivided interest or estate of any
of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made, shall thenceforth be a
charge only on the share assigned to such party ; but such share shall
be first charged with its just proportion of the costs of the partition in
preference to such lien.
Sec. 382. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold,
if there be an estate for life or for years in an undivided share of the
whole property, such estate may be set off in any part of the property
not ordered to be sold.

securities to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of
sale, or may order a just deduction to be made from the amount of the
lien on the property on account thereof.
Sec. 385. The proceeds of sale and the securities taken by the
referees, or any part thereof, shall be distributed by them to the persons
entitled thereto whenever the court so directs ; but in case no direction
be given, all such proceeds and securities shall be paid into court or
deposited therein, or as directed by the court.
Sec. 386. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or parcels be
longing to persons who are parties to the action, and who are known,
are paid into court, the action may be continued as between such par
ties for the determination of their respective claims thereto, which
shall be ascertained and adjudged by the court. Further testimony
may be taken in court or by a referee, at the discretion of the court ;
and the court may, if necessary, require such parties to present the
facts or law in controversy by pleadings as in an original action.

notice in the manner required for the sale of real property on execu

dian of such infant ; and for other shares in the name of the clerk of
the county and his successors in office.

estate shall have been sold, shall be entitled to receive such sum as
may be deemed a reasonable satisfaction for such estate, and which
the person so entitled may consent to accept instead thereof by an
instrument in writing, filed with the clerk of the court. Upon the
filing of such consent the clerk shall enter the same in the minutes of
the court.
Sec. 391. If such consent be not given, filed and entered, as pro
vided in the last section, at or before a judgment of sale is rendered,
the court shall ascertain and determine what proportion of the pro
ceeds of the sale, after deducting expenses, will be a just and reason
able sum to be allowed on account of such estate, and shall order the
same.to be paid to such party or deposited in the court for him, as the
case may require.
Sec. 892. If the persons entitled to such estate for life or years be
unknown, the court shall provide for the protection of their rights in
the same manner, as far as may be, as if they were known and had
appeared.

sistent with protection of a purchaser of property at a sale ordered by
the judgment, or had under process issued upon the judgment, on the

at any time before return day of the warrant, a written undertaking,
with two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the person arrested will
appear on return of the warrant, and abide the order of the court or
judge thereon, or they will pay, as may be directed, the sum specified in
the warrant.
Sec. 571. The officer shall return the warrant of arrest and under'
taking, if any, received by him from the person arrested, by the return
day specified therein.
Sec. 572. When the person arrested has been brought up Of
appeared, the court or judge shall proceed to investigate the charge,
and shall hear any answer which the person arrested may make to the
same, and may examine witnesses for or against him, for which an
adjournment may be had from time to time, if necessary.
Sec. 573. Upon the answer and evidence taken, the court or judge
shall determine whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the
contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he is guilty of the contempt
a fine may be imposed upon him, not exceeding five hundred dollars.
Sec. 574. When the contempt consists in the omission to perform
an act which is yet in the power of the person to perform, he may be
imprisoned until he shall have performed it, and in that case the act
shall be specified in the warrant of commitment.
Sec. 575. Persons proceeded against according to the provisions of
this chapter shall also be liable to indictment for the same misconduct,
if it be an indictable offence ; but the court before which a conviction
is had on the indictment, in passing sentence, shall take into considera
tion the punishment before inflicted.
Sec. 576. When the warrant of arrest has been returned served, if
the person arrested does not appear on return day, the court or judge
may issue another warrant of arrest, or may order the undertaking to be
prosecuted, or both. If the undertaking be prosecuted, the measure of
damages in the action shall be the extent of the loss or injury sustained
by the aggrieved party, by reason of the misconduct for which the war
rant was issued, and the costs of the proceedings.
Sec. 577. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an officer is
required to keep a person, arrested on a warrant of attachment, in cus
tody, and to bring him before a court or judge, the inability, from
illness or otherwise, of the person to attend, shall be a sufficient excuse
for not bringing him up ; and the officer shall not confine a person,
arrested upon the warrant, in a prison, or otherwise restrain him of per
sonal liberty, except so far as may be necessary to secure his personal
attendance.
Sec. 578. The judgment and order of the court or judge, made in
cases of contempt, shall be final and conslusive. The punishment

five hundred dollars.

statutes by which the same may be authorized.
Third. Wharves, docks, piers, chutes, booms, ferries, bridges, tollroads,
by-roads, plank and turnpike roads, steam and horse railroads ;

Second. Property appropriated to public use; but such property
shall not be taken unless for a more necessary public use than that to
which it has been already appropriated.
Third. Franchises for toll-roads, toll-bridges, and ferries, and all
other franchises ; but such franchises shall not be taken unless for free

Sec. 584. In all cases where land is required for public use, the
Territory, or its agents in charge of such use, may survey and locate
the same ; but it must be located in the manner which will be most
compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury,
and subject to the provisions of section 689. The Territory, or its
agents in charge of such public use, may enter upon the land and make
examination, surveys, and maps thereof, and such entry shall consti
tute no cause of action in favor of the owners of the land, except for
injuries resulting from negligence, wantonness, or malice.
Sec. 585. All proceedings under this title muBt be brought in the
district court for the county in which the property is situated. They
must be commenced by filing a complaint and issuing a summons
thereon.
Sec. 586. The complaint must contain :
First. The name of the corporation, association, commission, or
person in charge of the public use for which the property is sought,
who must be styled plaintiffs.
Second. The names of all owners and claimants of the property, if
known, or a statement that they are unknown, who must be styled
defendants.
Third. A statement of the right of the plaintiff.
Fourth. If a right of way be sought, the complaint must show the
location, general route, and termini, and must be accompanied by sur
veys and maps thereof.
Fifth. A description of each piece of land sought to be taken, and
whether the same includes a whole or only a part of an entire parcel or
tract.
Sixth. All parcels lying in the county, and required for the same
public use, may be included in the same or separate proceedings, at
the option of the plaintiff ; but the court may consolidate or separate
them, to suit the convenience of parties. When application for the
condemnation of a right of way for the purpose of sewerage is made on
behalf of a settlement, or of an incorporated village or town, the pro
bate judge alone must be named as plaintiff.
Sec. 587. The clerk must issue a summons, which must contain the
names of the parties, a general description of the whole property, a
statement of the public use for which it is sought, and a reference to
the complaint for descriptions of the respective parcels, and a notice to
the defendants to appear and show cause why the property described
should not be condemned as prayed for in the complaint. In all other
particulars, it must be m the form of a summons in civil actions, and
must be served in like manner.
Sec. 588. All persons in occupation of, or having or claiming an
interest in, any of the property described in the complaint, or in the
damages for the taking thereof, though not named, may appear, plead
and defend, each in respect to his property or interest, or that claimed
by him, in like manner as if named in the complaint.
Sec. 589. The court shall have power :
First. To regulate and determine the place and manner of making
connections and crossings ; of enjoying the common use mentioned in
the fifth sub-division of section 582.
Second. To hear and determine all adverse or conflicting claims to
the property sought to be condemned, and to the damages therefor.
Third. To determine the respective rights of different parties seeking
condemnation of the same property.
Sec. 590. The court, jury, or referee, must hear such legal testi
mony as may be offered by any other of the parties to the proceedings,
and thereupon must ascertain and assess :
First. The value of the property sought to be condemned, and all
improvements thereon pertaining to the realty, and of each and every
separate estate or interest therein ; if it consists of different parcels,
the value of each parcel and each estate or interest therein shall be
separately assessed.
Second. If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a
part of a larger parcel, the damages which will accrue to the portion
not sought to be condemned, by reason of its severance from the por
tion sought to be condemned, and the construction of the improve
ments in the manner proposed by the plaintiff.
Third. Separately, how much the portion not sought to be con
demned, and each estate or interest therein, will be benefitted, if at all,
by the construction of the improvement proposed by the plaintiff ; and
if the benefit shall be equal to the damages assessed under sub-division
two, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no compensation except
the value of the portion taken ;* but if the benefit shall be less than the
damages so assessed, the former slmll be deducted from the latter, and
the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to the
value.
Fourth. If the property sought to be condemned be for a railroad,
the cost of good and sufficient fences along the line of such railroad,
and the cost of cattle guards where fences may cross the line of such
railroad.
Fifth. As far as practicable, compensation must be assessed for
each source of damage separately.
Sec. 591. For the purpose of assessing compensation and damages,
the right thereto shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of the
summons, and its actual value at that date shall be the measure of
compensation for all property to be actually taken, and the basis of
damages to property not actually taken, but injuriously affected, in all
cases where such damages are allowed as provided in section 590.
If an order be made letting the plaintiff into possession, as provided
in section 596, the compensation and damages awarded shall draw law
ful interest from the date of such order. No improvements put upon
the property subsequent to the date of the service of summons shall be
included in tbe assessment of compensation or damages.
Sec. 592. If the title attempted to be acquired is found to be defec
tive from any cause, the plaintiff may agam institute proceedings to
acquire the same, as in this Title prescribed.
Sec. 598. The plaintiff must, within thirty days after final judg
ment, pay the sum of money assessed ; but may, at the time of or
before payment, elect to build the fences and cattle guards, and if he so
elect, shall execute to the defendant a bond, with sureties to be approved
by the court, in double the assessed costs of the same, to build such
fences and cattle guards within eighteen months from the time the
railroad is built on the land taken, and if such bond be given, need not
pay the costs of such fences and cattle guards. In an action on such
bond the plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney's fees.
Sec. 594. Payment may be made to the defendants entitled thereto,
or the money may be deposited in court for the defendants, and be dis
tributed to those entitled thereto. If the money be not so paid or
deposited, the defendants may have execution, as in civil cases, and if
the money cannot be made on execution, the court, upon a showing to
that effect, must set aside and annul the entire proceedings and restore
possession of the property to the defendant, if possession has been
taken by the plaintiff.
Sec. 595. When payments have been made and the bond given, if
the plaintiff elects to give one, as required by the last two sections, the
court must make a final order of condemnation, which must describe
the property condemned and the purpose of such condemnation. A
copy of the order must be filed in the office of the recorder of the
county, and thereupon the property described therein shall vest in the
plaintiff for the purposes therein specified.
Sec. 596. At any time after service of summons, the court may
authorize the plaintiff, if already in possession, to continue therein ;
and if not, then to take possession of and use the property during the
pendency and until the final conclusion of such proceedings, and may
stay all actions and proceedings against the plaintiff on account thereof ;
but the plaintiff must give security, to be approved by such court or
judge, to pay as well the compensation in that behalf, when ascer
tained, as all damages which may be sustained by the defendant, if for
any cause the property shall not be finally taken for public use.
Sec. 597. Costs may be allowed or not, and if allowed, may be
apportioned between the parties on the same or adverse sides, in the
discretion of the court.
Sec. 598. The direct evidence- of one witness, who is entitled to
full credit, is sufficient for proof of any fact, except perjury and
treason.
Sec. 599. A witness can testify of those facts only which he knows
of his own knowledgeâ€”that is, which are derived from his own per
ceptionsâ€”except in those few express cases in which his opinions, or
inferences, or the declarations of others are admissible.
Sec. 600. A witness can be heard only upon oath or affirmation,
and upon a trial he can be heard only in the presence, and subject to
the examination, of all the parties, if they choose to attend and
examine.
Sec. 601. A witness is presumed to speak the truth. This pre
sumption, however, may be repelled by the manner in which he testi
fies, by the character of his testimony, or by evidence affecting his
character for truth, honesty, or integrity, or his motives, or by con
tradictory evidence, and the jury are the exclusive judges of his credi
bility.
Sec. 602. The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by the declara
tion, act, or omission of another, except by virtue of a particular rela
tion between them ; therefore, proceedings against one cannot affect
another.
Sec. 608. Where, however, one derives title to real property from
another, the declaration, act, or omission of the latter while holding
the title in relation to the property, is evidence against the former.
Sec. 604. Where, also, the declaration, act or omission forms part
of a transaction, which is itself the fact in dispute, or evidence of that
fact, such declaration, act or omission is evidence as part of the trans
action.
Sec. 605. And where the question in dispute between the parties is
the obligation or duty of a third person, whatever would be the evi
dence for or against such person, is prima facie evidence between the
parties.
Sec. 606. The declaration, act, or omission of a member of a fam
ily, who is a decedent, or out of the jurisdiction, is also admissible
as evidence of common reputation, in cases where, on questions of
pedigree, such reputation is admissible.
Sec. 607. The declaration, act, or omission of a decedent, having
sufficient knowledge of the subject, against his pecuniary interest, is
also admissible as evidence to that extent against his successor in
interest.
Sec. 608. When part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing
is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may
be inquired into by the other ; when a letter is read, the answer may
be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or
writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation,
or writing which is necessary to make it understood, may also be given
in evidence.
Sec. 609. There can be no evidence of the contents of a writing,
other than the writing itself, except in the following cases :
First. When the original has been lost or destroyed, in which case
proof of the loss or destruction must first be made.
Second. When the original is in the possession of the party against
whom the evidence is offered, and he fails to produce it after a reason
able notice.
Third. When the original is a record or other document in the cus
tody of a public officer.
Fourth. When the original has been recorded and a certified copy
of the record is made evidence by this code or other statute.
Fifth. When the original consists of numerous accounts or other
documents which cannot be examined in court, without great loss of
time, and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of
the whole.
In the cases mentioned in sub-divisions three and four, a copy of the
original, or of the record, must be produced ; in those mentioned in
sub-divisions one and two, either a copy or oral evidence of the con
tents.
Sec. 610. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to
writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those
terms, and, therefore, there can be, between the parties and their repre
sentatives or successors in interest, fno evidence of the terms of the
agreement other than the contents of the writing, except in the follow
ing cases :
First. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue
by the pleadings.
Second. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.
But this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances
under which the agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined
in section 614 ; or to explain an extrinsic ambiguity, or to establish
illegality or fraud. The term agreement includes deeds and wills, as
well as contracts between parties.
Sec. 611. The language of a writing is to be interpreted according
to the meaning it bears in the place of its execution, unless the parties
have reference to a different place.
Sec. 612. In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office
of the judge is simply to ascertain and determine what is, in terms or
in substance, contained thereinâ€”not to insert what has been omitted,
or to omit what has been inserted ; and where there are several provis
ions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted,
as will give effect to all.
Sec. 613. In the construction of a statute, the intention of the
legislature, and in the construction of the instrument, the intention of
the parties is to be pursued, if possible ; and when a general and a par
ticular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the
former. So a particular intent will control a general one that is incon
sistent with it.
Sec. 614. For the proper construction of an instrument, the cir
cumstances under which it was made, including the situation of the
subject of the instrument and of the parties to it, may also be shown, so
that the judge be placed in the position of those whose language he is
to interpret.
Sec. 615. The terms of a writing are presumed to have been used
in their primary and general acceptation, out evidence is, nevertheless,
admissible that they have a local, technical, or otherwise peculiar
signification, and were so used and understood in the particular
instance, in which case the agreement must be construed accordingly.
Sec. 616. When an instrument consists partly of written words
and partly of a printed form, and the two are inconsistent, the former
controls the latter.
Sec. 617. When the characters in which an instrument is written
are difficult to be deciphered, or the language of the instrument is not
understood by the court, the evidence of persons skilled in deciphering
the characters, or who understand the language, is admissible to
declare the characters or the meaning of the language.
Sec. 618. When the terms of an agreement have been intended in
a different sense by the different parties to it, that sense is to prevail
against either party in which he supposed the other understood it ; and
when different constructions of a provision are otherwise equally
proper, that is to be taken which is most favorable to the party in
whose favor the provision was made.
Sec. 619. A written notice, as well as every other writing, is to be
construed according to the ordinary acceptation of its terms. Thus, a
notice to the drawers or endorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory
note that it has been protested for want of acceptance or payment,
must be held to import that the same has been duly presented for
acceptance or payment, and the same refused, and that the holder
looks for payment to the person to whom the notice is given.
Sec. 620. When a statute or instrument is equally susceptible of
two interpretations, one in favor of natural right, and the other against
it, the former is to be adopted.
Sec. 621. None but a material allegation need to be proved.
Sec. 622. Evidence must correspond with the substance of the mate
rial allegations, and be relevant to the question in dispute. Collateral
questions must therefore be avoided. It is, however, within the dis
cretion of the court to permit inquiry into a collateral fact when such
fact is directly connected with the question in dispute, and is essential
to its proper determination, or when it affects the credibility of a
witness.
Sec. 628. Each party must prove his own affirmative allegations.
Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation, except
when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of
the right or title on which the cause of action or defence is founded ;
not even in such case, when the allegation is a denial of the existence
of a document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party.
Sec. 624. In conformity with the preceding provisions, evidence
may be given upon a trial of the followmg facts :
First. The precise fact in dispute.
Second. The act, declaration or omission of a party as evidence
against such party.
Third. An act or declaration of another, in the presence and within
the observation of a party, and his conduct in relation thereto.
Fowrth. The act or declaration, verbal or written, of a deceased
person in respect to the relationship, birth, marriage, or death of
any person related by blood or marriage to such deceased person ; the
act or declaration of a deceased person done or made against his inter
est in respect to his real property ; and also in criminal actions the act
or declaration of a dying person, made under a sense of impending
death, respecting the cause of his death.
Fifth. After proof of a partnership or agency, the act or declara
tion of a partner or agent of the party, within the scope of the part
nership or agency, and during its existence. The same rule applies to
the act or declaration of a joint owner, joint debtor, or other person
jointly interested with the party.
Sixth. After proof of a conspiracy, the act or declaration of a con
spirator against his co-conspirator, and relating to the conspiracy.
Seventh. The act, declaration, or omission forming part of a trans
action, as explained in section 604.
Eighth. The testimony of a witness deceased, or out of the juris
diction, or unable to testify, given in a former action between the same
parties, relating to the same matter.
Ninth. The opinion of the witness respecting the identity oi[ hand
writing of a person when he has knowledge of the person or handwrit
ing ; his opinion on a question of science, art, or trade, when he is
skilled therein.
Tenth. The opinion of a subscribing witness to a writing, the valid
ity of which is in dispute, respecting the mental sanity of the signer,
and the opinion of an intimate acquaintance respecting the mental
sanity of a person, the reason of the opinion being given.
Eleventh. Common reputation existing previous to the controversy
respecting facts of a general or public interest more than thirty years
old, and in cases of pedigree and boundary.
Twelfth. Usage, to explain the true character of an act, contract, or
instrument, where such true character is not otherwise plain ; but
usage is never admissible except as an instrument of interpretation.
Thirteenth. Monuments and inscriptions in public places as evi
dence of common reputation; and entries in family bibles or other
family books or charts, engravings on rings, family portraits, and the
like, as evidence of pedigree.
Fourteenth. The contents of a writing, when oral evidence thereof
is admissible.
Fifteenth. Any facts from which the facts in issue are presumed, or
are logically inferable.
Sixteenth. Such facts as served to show the credibility of a witness,
as explained in section 601.
Sec. 625. Courts take judicial notice of the following facts :
First. The true signification of all English words and phrases, and
all legal expressions.
Second. Whatever is established by law.
Third. Public and private official acts of the legislature, executive,
and judicial departments of this Territory, and of the United States.
Fourth. The seals of all the courts of this Territory, and of the
United States.
Fifth. The accession to office, and the official signatures and seals
of office, of the principal officers of government in the legislature,
executive and judicial departments of this Territory and the United
States.
Sixth. The existence, title, national flag, and seal of every State
or sovereign recognized by the executive power of the United States.
Seventh. The seals of courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdic
tion, and of notaries public.
Eighth. The laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geo
graphical divisions and political history of the world.
In all the cases the court may resort, for its aid, to appropriate books
or documents of reference.

Sec. 626. All persons, without exception otherwise than is specified
in the next two sections, who, having organs of sense, can perceive,

witnesses. Therefore, neither parties nor other persons who have an
interest in the event of an action or proceeding are excluded, nor those
who have been convicted of crime, nor persons on account of their
opinions on matters of religious belief; although in every case the
credibility of the witnesses may be drawn in question, as provided in section 601.
Sec. 627. No person shall be allowed to testify, under provision of
the last section, where the adverse party, or the party for whose imme
diate benefit the action or proceeding is prosecuted or defended, is the
representative of a deceased person, when the facts to be proved trans
pired before the death of such deceased person ; and nothing in said section shall affect the laws in relation to attestation of any instrument
required to be attested ; nor shall anything contained in said section
render any person, who, in a criminal proceeding, is charged with the
commission of any public offence, competent or compellable to give
evidence therein for or against himself.
Sec. 628. The following persons shall not be witnesses :
First. Those who are of unsound mind at the time of their produc
tion for examination.
Second. Children under ten years of age, who, in the opinion of the
court, appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts
respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.
Third. Persons against whom judgment has been rendered upon a
conviction for a felony, unless pardoned by the governor, or such judg
ment has been reversed on appeal.
Sec. 629. There are particular relations in which it is the policy of
the law to encourage confidence, and to preserve it inviolate ; therefore
a person cannot be examined as a witness in the following cases :
First. A husband cannot be examined for or against his wife with
out her consent, nor a wife for or against her husband without his con
sent ; nor can either, during the marriage or afterwards, be, without
the consent of the other, examined as to any communication made by
one to the other during the marriage ; but this exception does not apply
to a civil action or proceeding by one against the other, nor to a crimi
nal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one against the
other.
Second. An attorney or counselor shall not, without the consent of
his client, be examined as a witness as to any communication made by
the client to him, or his advice given thereon, in the course of profes
sional employment.
Third. A clergyman or priest shall not, without the consent of the

of his patient, be examined in a civil action, as to any information ac
quired in attending the patient, which was necessary to enable him to

Sec. 630. A public officer shall not be examined as a witness as to
communications made to him in official confidence, when the public
interest would suffer by the disclosure.
Sec. 631. The judge, himself, or any juror, may be called as a

the court or judge to order the trial to be postponed or suspended, and
to take place before another judge or jury.
Sec. 632. When a witness does not understand and speak the
English language, an interpreter shall be sworn to interpret for him.
Any person, a resident of the proper county, may be summoned by any
court or judge to appear before such court or judge, to act as interpreter
in any action or proceeding. The summons shall be served and re
turned in like manner as a subpoena. Any person so summoned shall,
for a failure to attend at the time and place named in the summons, be
deemed guilty of a contempt, and may be punished accordingly. A
person summoned as an interpreter shall receive such compensation
as the court in its discretion may order, in addition to the fees allowed
by law.
Sec. 633. A subpoena may require not only the attendance of the
person to whom it is directed at a particular time and place, to testify
as a witness, but may also require him to bring any books, documents,
or other things under his control, to be used as evidence. No person

proved, whether the same be in writing in his possession or not, or is
lost or destroyed, or beyond the jurisdiction of the Territory, or a
nuncupative will.
Sec. 10. A petition for the probate of a will must show :
First. The jurisdictional facts.
Second. Whether the person named as executor consents to act, or
renounces his right to letters testamentary.
Third. The names, ages, and residence of the heirs and devisees of
the decedent, so far as known to the petitioner.
Fourth. The probable value and character of the property of the
estate.
Fifth. The name of the person for whom letters testamentary are
prayed.
No defect of form or in the statement of jurisdictional facts actually
existing shall make void the probate of a will.

after he has knowledge of the death of the testator, and that he is
named as executor, fails to petition the proper court for the probate of
the will, and that letters testamentary be issued to him, he has
renounced his right to letters, and the court may appoint any other
competent person administrator, unless good cause for delay is
shown.
Sec. 12. If it is alleged in any petition that any will is in the pos
session of a third person, and the court is satisfied that the allegation
is correct, an order must be issued and served upon the person having
possession of the will, requiring him to produce it at a time named in
the order. If he has possession of the will, and neglects or refuses to
produce it in obedience to the order, he may, by warrant from the
court, be committed to the jail of the county, and be kept in close con
finement until he produces it.
Sec. 13. When the petition is filed and the will produced, the pro
bate judge must fix a day for hearing the petition, not less than ten
nor more than thirty days from the production of the will. Notice of
the hearing shall be given by the clerk of the court, by publishing the
same in a newspaper of the county ; if there be none, then by three
written or printed notices posted at three of the most public places in
the county. If the notice is published in a weekly newspaper, it must
appear therein on at least three different days of publication, and if in
a newspaper published oftener than once a week, it shall be so pub
lished that there must be at least ten days from the first to the last
day of publication, both the first and the last day being included. If
the notice is by posting, it must be given at least ten days before the
hearing.
Sec. 14. Copies of the notice of the time appointed for the probate
of the will must be addressed to the heirs of the testator resident in the

ten days before the hearing. If their places of residence be not known,
the copies of notice may be addressed to them and deposited in the
post office at the county seat of the county where the proceedings are
pending. A copy of the same notice must in like manner be mailed
to the person named as executor, if he be not the petitioner ; also, to
any person named as co-executor, not petitioning, if their places of

Devisees, legatees, or heirs of an estate may contest the will through
their guardians, or attorneys appointed by themselves or by the court
for that purpose ; but a contest made by an attorney appointed by the
court, does not bar a contest after probate by the party so represented,
if commenced within the time provided in Article IV of this chapter ;
nor does the non- appointment of an attorney by the court of itself
invalidate the probate of a will.
Sec. 18. If no person appears to contest the probate of a will, the
court may admit it to probate on the testimoney of one of the subscrib
ing witnesses only, if he testifies that the will was executed in all par

the testator and of the subscribing witnesses, or any of them.
Sec. 24. The testimony of each witness, reduced to writing and

must, at the same time, cause a notice to be issued to the executor or
administrator, requiring his appearance on the return of the citation ;
and on its return he may examine the sureties, and such witnesses as
may be produced, touching the property of the sureties and its value ;
and if, upon such examination, he is satisfied that the bond is insuffi
cient, he must require sufficient additional security.
Sec. 82. If sufficient security is not given within the time fixed by
the judge's order, the right of such executor or administrator to the
administration shall cease, and the person next entitled to the admin
istration on the estate, who will execute a sufficient bond, must be
appointed to the administration.
Sec. 83. When it is expressly provided in the will that no bond
shall be required of the executor, letters testamentary may issue, and
Bales of real estate be made and confirmed, without any bond, unless
the court, for good cause, require one to be executed ; but the executor
may at any time afterwards, if it appear from any cause necessary or
proper, be required to file a bond as in other cases.
Sec. 84. Any person interested in an estate may, by verified pefftion,
represent to the probate judge that the sureties of the executor
or administrator 'thereof have become or are becoming insolvent, or
that they have removed or are about to remove from the Territory, or,
from any other cause, that the bond is insufficient, and ask that further
security be required.
Sec. 85. If the probate judge is satisfied that the matter requires
investigation, a citation must be issued to the executor or administra
tor, requiring him to appear at a time and place to be therein specified,
to show cause why he should not give further security. The citation
must be served personally on the executor or administrator, at least
five days before the return day. If he has absconded, or cannot be
found, it may be served by leaving a copy of it at his place of residence,
or by such publication as the court or judge may order.
Sec. 86. On the return of the citation, or at such other time as the
judge may appoint, he must proceed to hear the proofs and allegations
of the parties. If it satisfactorily appears that the security is from
any cause insufficient, he may make an order requiring the executor
or administrator to give further security, or to file a new bond in the
usual form, within a reasonable time â€”not less than five days.
Sec. 87. K the executor or administrator neglects to comply with
the order within the time prescribed, the judge must, by order, revoke
his letters, and his authority must thereupon cease.
Sec. 88. When a petition is presented, praying that an executor or
administrator be required to give further security, or to give bond, if,
by the terms of the will no bond was originally required, and it is
alleged, on oath, that the executor or administrator is wasting the
property of the estate, the judge may, by order, suspend his powers
until the matter can be heard and determined.
Sec. 89. When it comes to his knowledge that the bond of any
executor or administrator is from any cause insufficient, the probate
judge, without any application, must cause him to be cited to appear
and show cause why he should not give further security ; and must
proceed thereon as upon the application of any person interested.
Sec. 90. Where a surety of any executor or administrator desires
to be released from responsibility on account of future acts, he may
make application to the probate court or judge for relief. The court
or judge must cause a citation to the executor or administrator to be
issued, and served personally, requiring him to appear at a time and
place to be therein specified, and to give other security ; if he has
absconded, left, or removed from the Territory, or if he cannot be found
after due diligence and inquiry, service may be made as provided in section 85.
Sec. 91. If new sureties be given to the satisfaction of the judge,
he may thereupon make an order that the sureties who applied for
relief shall not be liable on their bond for any subsequent act, default,
or misconduct of the executor or administrator.
Sec. 92. If the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to give
new sureties, to the satisfaction of the judge, on the return of the cita
tion, or within such reasonable time as the judge shall allow, unless
the surety making the application shall consent to a longer extension
of time, the court or judge, must, by order, revoke his letters.
Sec. 93. The applications authorized by the nine preceding sections
of this chapter may be heard and determined out of term time.
All orders made therein must be entered upon the minutes of the
court.

Sec. 94. The liability of principal and sureties upon the bond of
any executor, administrator, or guardian, is in all cases to pay in the
kind of money or currency in which the principal is legally liable.
Sec. 95. When there is delay in granting letters testamentary or of
administration, from any cause, or when such letters are granted irreg
ularly, or no sufficient bond is filed as required, or when no application
is made for such letters, or when an administrator or executor dies or
is suspended or removed, the probate judge must appoint a special
administrator to collect and take charge of the estate of the decedent,
in whatever county or counties the same may be found, and to exercise
such other powers as may be necessary for the preservation of the
estate, or he may direct the public administrator of his county to take
charge of the estate.
Sec. 96. The appointment may be made out of term time, and
without notice, and must be made by entry upon the minutes of the
court specifying the powers to be exercised by the administrator.
Upon such order being entered, and after the person appointed has
given bond, the clerk must issue letters of administration to such per
son in conformity with the order.
Sec. 97. In making the appointment of a special administrator, the
probate judge must give preference to the person entitled to letters
testamentary or of administration, but no appeal must be allowed from
the appointment.
Sec. 98. Before, any letters issue to any special administrator, he
must give bond in such sum as the probate judge may direct, with
sureties to the satisfaction of the judge, conditioned for the faithful
performance of his duties ; and he must take the usual oath, and have
the same endorsed on his letters.
Sec. 99. The special administrator must, collect and preserve for
the executor or administrator all the goods, chattels, debts, and effects
of the decedent, all incomes', rents, issues, and profits, claims and
demands of the estate ; must take the charge and management of,
enter upon and preserve from any damage, waste, and injury, the real
estate, and for any such and all necessary purposes, may commence
and maintain or defend suits and other legal proceedings, as an admin
istrator ; he may sell such perishable property as the probate court may
order to be sold, and exercise such other powers as are conferred upon
him by his appointment ; but in no case is he liable to an action by any
creditor on a claim against the decedent.
Sec. 100. When letters testamentary or of administration on the
estate of the decedent have been granted, the powers of the special
administrator cease, and he must forthwith deliver to the executor or
administrator all the property and effects of the decedent in his hands ;
and the executor or administrator may prosecute to final judgment any
suit commenced by the special administrator.
Sec. 101. The special administrator must render an account, on
oath, of his proceedings, in like manner as other administrators are
required to do.
Sec. 102. If, after granting letters of administration on the ground
of intestacy, a will of the decedent is duly proved and allowed by the
court, the letters of administration must be revoked, and the powers of
administrator shall cease, and he must render an account of his admin
istration within such time as the court shall direct.
Sec. 103. In such case, the executor, or the administrator with the
will annexed, is entitled to demand, sue for, recover and collect all the
rights, goods, chattels, debts, and effects of the decedent remaining
unadministered, and may prosecute to final judgment any suit com
menced by the administrator before the revocation of his letters of
administration.
Sec. 104. In case any one of the several executors or administrators,
to whom letters are granted, dies, becomes lunatic, is convicted of an
infamous crime, or otherwise becomes incapable of executing the trust,
or in case the letters testamentary or of administration are revoked or
annulled with respect to any one executor or administrator, the remain
ing executor or administrator must proceed to complete the execution
of the will or administration.
Sec. 105. If all such executors or administrators die or become
incapable, or the power and authority of all of them is revoked, the
probate court must issue letters of administration with the will annexed,
or otherwise, to the widow, or next of kin, or others, in the same order
and manner as is directed in relation to original letters of administra
tion. The administrators so appointed must give bond in the like
penalty, with like sureties and conditions, as hereinbefore required of
administrators, and shall have the like power and authority.
Sec. 106. Any executor or administrator may, at any time, by
writing filed in the probate court, resign his appointment, having first
settled his accounts, and delivered up all the estate to the person
whom the court shall appoint to receive the same. If, however, by
reason of any delay in such settlement tod delivering up of the estate,
or for any other cause, the circumstances of the estate, or the right of
those interested therein, require it, the court may, at any time before
settlement of accounts and delivering up of the estate is completed,
revoke the letters of such executor or administrator, and appoint in his
stead an administrator, either special or general, in the same manner
as is directed in relation to orignal letters of administration. The
liability of the outgoing executor or administrator, or of the sureties
on his bond, shall not be in any manner discharged, released, or
affected by such appointment or resignation.
Sec. 107. All acts of an executor or administrator, as such, before
the revocation of his letters testamentary, or of administration, are as
valid, to all intents and purposes, as if such executor or administrator
had continued lawfully to execute the duties of his trust. .
Sec. 108. A transcript from the minutes of the court, showing the
appointment of any person as executor or administrator, together with
the certificate of the clerk, under his hand and the seal of his court,
that such person has given bond and been qualified, and that letters
testamentary or of administration have been issued to him, and have
not been revoked, shall have the same effect in evidence as the letters
themselves.
Sec. 109. No probate court shall admit to probate any will, or grant
letters testamentary or of administration, in any case where the judge
thereof is interested as next of kin to the decedent, or as a legatee
or divisee under the will, or when he is named as executor or trustee in
the will, or as a witness thereto, or is in any other manner interested or
disqualified from acting.
Sec. 110. When a petition is filed in the probate court, praying for
admission to probate of a will, or for granting letters testamentary or
of administration, or when proceedings are pending in the probate court
for the settlement of an estate, and the presiding judge of the court is
disqualified to act from any cause, upon his own or the motion of any
person interested in the estate, he must make an order transferring the
proceeding to the probate court of an adjoining county, and the clerk
of the court ordering the transfer must transmit to the clerk of the court
to which the proceeding is ordered to be transferred, a certified copy
of the order, and all papers on file in his office in the proceeding ; and
thereafter the probate court to which the proceeding is transferred shall
exercise the same authority and jurisdiction over the estate, and all mat
ters relating to the administration thereof, as if it had original jurisdic
tion of the estate.
Sec. 111. The transfer of a proceeding from one court to another,
as provided for in the preceding section, shall not affect the right" of
any person to letters testamentary or of administration on the estate
transferred, but the same persons are entitled to letters testamentary
or of administration on the estate, in the order hereinbefore provided.
If, before the administration is closed of any estate so transferred as
herein provided, another person is elected or appointed and qualified as
probate judge of the county wherein such proceeding was orginally com
menced, who is not disqualified to act in the settlement of the estate,
and the causes for which the proceeding was transferred no longer exist,
any person interested in the estate may have the proceeding returned
to the court from which it was originally transferred, by filing a peti
tion setting forth these facts, and moving the court therefor.
Sec' 112. On hearing the motion, if the facts required by the pre
ceding section to be set out in the petition are satisfactorily shown, and
it further appears to the court that the convenience of parties interested
would be promoted by such change, the Judge must make an order
transferring the proceeding back to the probate court where it was
originally commenced ; and the clerk of the court ordering the transfer
mu3t transmit to the clerk of the court in which the proceeding was
originally commenced, a certified copy of the order, and all the original
papers on file in his office in the proceeding, and the court where the
proceeding was originally commenced shall thereafter have jurisdiction
and power to make all necessary orders and decrees to close up the
administration of the estate.
Sec. 113. Whenever the probate judge has reason to believe, from
his own knowledge or from credible information, that any executor or
administrator has wasted, embezzled, or mismanaged, or is about to
waste or embezzle, the property of the estate committed to his charge,
or has committed, or is about to commit, a fraud upon the estate, or is
incompetent to act, or has permanently removed from the Territory, or
has wrongfully neglected the estate, or has long neglected to perform
any act as such executor or administrator, he must, by an order entered
upon the minutes of the court, suspend the powers of such executor or
administrator until the matter is investigated.
Sec. 114. When such suspension is made, notice thereof must be
given to the executor or administrator, and he must be cited to appear
and show cause why his letters should not be revoked. If he fail to
appear in obedience to the citation, or, if appearing, the court is satis
fied that there exists cause for his removal, his letters must be revoked,
and letters of administration granted anew, as the case may require.
Sec. 115. At the hearing any person interested in the estate may
appear and file his allegations in writing, showing that the executor or
administrator should be removed, to which the executor or adminis
trator may demur or answer, as hereinbefore provided. The issues
raised must be heard and determined by the court.
Sec. 116. If the executor or administrator has absconded or con
ceals himself, or has removed or absented himself from the Territory,
notice may be given him of the pendency of the proceedings, by publi
cation, in such manner as the court may direct, and the court may
proceed upon such no Lice as if the citation had been personally
served.
Sec. 117. In the proceedings authorized by the preceding sections
of this article for the removal of an executor or administrator, the court
may compel his attendance by attachment, and may compel him to
answer questions, on oath, touching his administration, and upon his
refusal so to do, may commit him until he obey, or may revoke nis let
ters, or both.
Sec. 118. Every executor or administrator must make and return
to the court, at its first term after his appointment, a true inventory
and appraisement of all the estate of the decedent, including the home
stead, if any, which has come to his possession or knowledge.
Sec. 119. To make the appraisement, the probate judge or court
must appoint three disinterested persons (any two of whom may act),
who are entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their servi
ces, not to exceed five dollars per day, to be allowed by the court or
judge. The appraisers must, with the inventory, file a verified account
of their services and disbursements. If only one day's services are
charged, the bill need not be sworn to.
If any part of the estate is in any other county than that in which
letters are issued, appraisers thereof may be appointed, either by the
probate judge having jurisdiction of the estate or Dy the probate judge
of such other county, on request of the judge having jurisdiction.
Sec. 120. Before proceeding to the execution of their duty, the
appraisers, before any officer authorized to administer oaths, must
take and subscribe an oath, to be attached to the inventory, that they
will truly, honestly, and impartially appraise the property which is
exhibited to them, according to the best of their knowledge and ability.
They must then proceed to estimate and appraise the property. Each article must be set down separately, with the value thereof in dollars
and cents, in figures, opposite the articles respectively. The inventory
must contain all the estate of the decedent, real and personal, a state
ment of all debts, partnerships, and other interests, bonds, mortgages,
notes, and other securities for Uhe payment of money belonging to the
decedent, specifying the name of the debtor in each security, the date,
the sum originally payable, the indorsements thereon (if any), with
their dates, and the sum which, in the judgment of the appraisers, may
be collected on each debt, interest, or security. The inventory must
show, so far as the same can be ascertained by the executor or the
administrator, what portion of the property is community property,
and what portion is the separate property of the decedent.
Sec. 121. The inventory must also contain an account of all moneys
belonging to the decedent which have come to the hands of the execu
tor or administrator ; and if none, the fact must be so stated in the
inventory. If the whole estate consists of money, there need not be an
appraisement, but an inventory must be made and returned as in other
cases.
Sec. 122. The naming of a person as executor does not thereby dis
charge him from any just claim which the testator has against him, but
the claim must be included in the inventory, and the executor is liable
for the same as for so much money in his hands when the debt or
demand becomes due.
Sec. 123. The discharge or bequest in a will of any debt or demand
of the testator against the executor named, or any other person, is not
valid against the creditors of the decedent, but is a specific bequest of
the debt or demand. It must be included in the inventory, and, if
necessary, applied in the payment of his debts ; if not necessary for
that purpose, it must be paid in the same manner and proportion as
other specific legacies.
Sec. 124. The inventory must be signed by the appraisers, and the
executor or administrator must take and subscribe an oath, before an
officer authorized to administer oaths, that the inventory contains a
true statement of all the estate of the decedent which has come to his
knowledge and possession, and particularly of all money belonging to
the decedent, and of all just claims of the decedent against the affiant.
The oath must be endorsed upon or annexed to the inventory.
Sec. 125. If an executqr or administrator neglects or refuses to
return the inventory within the time prescribed, or within such further
time, not exceeding two months, which the court or judge shall, for
reasonable cause, allow, the court may, upon notice, revoke the letters
testamentary or of administration, and the executor or administrator
is liable on his bond for any injury to the estate, or any person inter
ested therein, arising from such failure.
Sec. 126. Whenever property not mentioned in an inventory that is
made and filed comes to the possession or knowledge of an executor or
administrator, he must cause the same to be appraised in the manner
prescribed in this article, and an inventory thereof to be returned within
two months after the discovery ; and the making of such inventory may
be enforced, after notice, by attachment or removal from office.
Sec. 127. The executor or administrator is entitled to the possession
of all the real and personal estate of the decedent, and to receive the
rents and profits of the real estate, until* the estate is settled, or until
delivered over by order of the probate court to the heirs or devisees ;
and must keep in good tenantable repair all houses, buildings, and
fixtures thereon, which are under his control.
The heirs or devisees may themselves, or jointly with the executor or
administrator, maintain an action for the possession of the real estate,
or for the purpose of quieting the title, to the same, against any one
except the executor or administrator.
Sec. 128. Unless it satisfactorily appears to the probate court that
the rents, issues, and profits of the real estate for a longer period are
necessary to be received by the executor or administrator, wherewith
to pay the debts of the decedent, or that it will probably be necessary
to sell the real estate for the payment of such debts, at the end of ten
months from the first publication of the notice to creditors, the court
must direct the executor or administrator to deliver possession of all
the real estate to the heirs at law or devisees.
Sec. 129. If any person, before the granting of letters testamentary
or of administration, embezzles or alienates any of the moneys, goods,
chattels, or effects of a decedent, he is chargeable therewith, and liable
to an action by the executor or administrator of the estate for double the
value of the property so embezzled or alienated, to be recovered for the
benefit of the estate.
Sec. 130. If any executor, administrator, or other person inter
ested in the estate of a decedent, complains to the probate judge, on
oath, that any person is suspected to have concealed, embezzled,
smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any moneys, goods, or
chattels of the decedent, or has in his possession or knowledge any
deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or other writings, which contain
evidences of or tend to disclose the right, title, interest, or claim of the
decedent to any real or personal estate, or any claim or demand, or any
last will, the judge may cite such person to appear before the probate
court, and may examine him on oath upon the matter of such com
plaint. If such person is not in the county where letters have been
granted, he may be cited and examined, either before the probate court
of the county where he is found, or before the court issuing the citation.
But if, in the latter case, he appears, and is found innocent, his neces
sary expenses must be allowed him out of the estate.
Sec. 131. If the person so cited refuse to appear and submit to an
examination, or to answer such interrogatories as may be put to him,
touching the matter of the complaint, the court may, by warrant for
that purpose, commit him to the county jail, there to remain in close
custody until he submits to the order of the court, or is discharged
according to law. If, upon such examination, it appears that he has
concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any
moneys, goods, or chattels of the decedent, or that he has in his pos
session or knowledge any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or
other writings, tending to disclose the right, title, interest or claim of
the decedent to any real or personal estate, claim, or demand, or any
last will of the decedent, the probate court may make an order requir
ing such person to disclose his knowledge thereof to the executor or
administrator, and may commit him to the county jail, there to remain
until the order is complied with, or he is discharged according to law.
And all such interrogatories and answers must be in writing, signed
by the party examined, and filed in the probate court.
The order for such disclosure made upon such examination is prima
facie evidence of the right of such administrator to such property, in
any action brought for the recovery thereof; and any judgment
recovered therein must be for double the value of the property as
assessed by the court or jury, or for return of the property, and dam
ages in addition thereto equal to the value of such property.
In addition to the examination of the party, witnesses may be pro
duced and examined on either side. u
Sec. 132. The probate judge, upon the complaint, on oath, of an
executor or administrator, may cite any person who has been entrusted
with any part of the estate of the decedent, to appear before such
court, and require him to render a full account, on oath, of any
moneys, goods, chattels, bonds, accounts, or other property or papers
belonging to the estate, which have come to his possession in trust for
the executor or administrator, and of his proceedings thereon ; and if
the person so cited refuses to appear and render such account, the court
may proceed against him as provided in the preceding section.

living, was selected, it vests, on the death of the husband or wife, abso

rate property of either husband or wife, it vests, on the death of the
person from whose property it was selected, in his or her heirs, subject
to the power of the probate court to assign it for a limited period to the
family of the decedent. In either case it is not subject to the payment
of any debt or liability contracted by or existing against the husband

persons in whom title is vested by the preceding section. If there be
subsisting liens or incumbrances on the homestead, the claims secured
thereby must be presented and allowed as other claims against the
estate. If the funds of the estate be adequate to pay all claims allowed
against the estate, the claims so secured must be paid out of such
funds ; if the funds of the estate be not sufficient for that purpose, the
claims so secured shall be paid proportionally with other claims

set apart to the parties entitled thereto such portion of the premises,
including the dwelling house, as will amount in value to the sum of
two thousand five hundred dollars, and make report thereof, giving the
metes, bounds, and full description of the portion set apart as a home
stead. If the appraisers find that the premises exceeded in value, at
the time of their selection, the sum of two thousand five .hundred
dollars, and that they cannot be divided without material injury, they
must report such finding, and thereafter the court may make an order
for the sale of the premises and the distribution of the proceeds to the
parties entitled thereto.
Sec. 148. Any two of the appraisers concurring may discharge the
duties imposed upon the three, and make the report. A dissenting
report may be made by the third appraiser. The report must state
fully the acts of the appraisers. Both reports may be heard and con
sidered by the court in determining a confirmation or rejection of the
majority report, but the minority report must in no case be confirmed.
Sec. 144. When the report of the appraisers is filed the court must
set a day for hearing any objections thereto from any one interested in
the estate. Notice of the hearing must be given for such time and in
such manner as the court may direct. If the court be satisfied that
the report is correct, it must be confirmed, otherwise rejected. In
case the report is rejected, the court may appoint new appraisers to
examine and report upon the homestead, and similar proceedings may
be had for the confirmation or rejection of their report as upon the first
report.
Sec. 145. The costs of all proceedings in the probate court provided
for in this chapter, must be paid by the estate, as expenses of admin
istration. Persons succeeding, by purchase or otherwise, to the
interests, rights, and title of successors to homesteads, or to the
right to have homesteads set apart to them, as in this chapter
provided, have all the rights and benefits conferred by law on the per
sons whose interests and rights they acquire.
Sec. 146. A certified copy of every final order made in pursuance
of this article, by which a report is confirmed, property assigned, or
sale confirmed, must be recorded in the office of the recorded of the
county where the homestead property is situated.

county, if there be one (if not, then in such newspaper as may be des
ignated by the court), a notice to the creditors of the deceased, requir
ing all persons having claims against him to exhibit them, with the
necessary vouchers, to the executor or administrator, at the place of
his residence or business, to be specified in the notice. Such notice
must be published as often as the judge or court shall direct, but not
less than once a week for four successive weeks ; the court or judge
may also direct additional notice by publication or posting. In case
such executor or administrator resign or is removed before the time
expressed in the notice, his successor must give notice for only the
unexpired time allowed for such presentation.
Sec. 148. The time expressed in the notice must be ten months
after its first publication when the estate exceeds in value the sum of
ten thousand dollars, and four months when it does not.
Sec. 149. After notice is given as required by the preceding section,
a copy thereof, with the affidavit of due publication, or of publication
and posting, must be filed ; and upon such affidavit or other testimony
to the satisfaction of the court, an order or decree showing that due
notice to the creditors has been given, and directing that such order or
decree be entered in the minutes and recorded, must be made by the
court.
Sec. 150. If a claim arising upon a contract heretofore made be no
presented within the time limited in the notice, it is barred forever,
except as follows : If it be not then due, or if it be contingent, it may
be presented within one month after it becomes due or absolute ; if it
be made to appear by the affidavit of the claimant, to the satisfactis*
faction of the executor or administrator and the probate judge, that
the claimant had no notice, as provided in this chapter, by reason of
being out of the Territory, it may be presented any time before a decree
of distribution is entered. A claim for a deficiency remaining unpaid
after a sale of property of the estate mortgaged or pledged must be
presented within one month after such deficiency is ascertained. All
claims arising upon contracts hereafter made, whether the same be due,
not due, or contingent, must be presented within the time limited in the
notice ; and any claim not so presented is barred forever : Provided,
however, That when it is made to appear by the affidavit of the claim
ant, to the satisfaction of the executor or administrator and the pro
bate judge, that the claimant had no notice, Tas provided in this chap
ter, by reason of being out of the Territory, it may be presented at any
time before a decree of distribution is entered.
Sec. 151. Every claim which is due when presented to the adminis
trator must be supported by the affidavit of the claimant, or some one
in his behalf, and that the amount is justly due, that no payments
have been made thereon which are not credited, and that there are no
set-offs to the same to the knowledge of the claimant or affiant. If the
claim be not due when presented, or be contingent, the particulars of
such claim must be stated. When the affidavit is made by a person
other than the claimant, he must set forth in the affidavit the reasons
why it is not made by the claimant. The oath may be taken before
any officer authorized to administer oaths. The executor or adminis
trator may also require satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be produced
in support of the claim. If the estate be insolvent, no greater rate of
interest shall be allowed upon any claim after the first publication of
notice to creditors than is allowed on judgments obtained in the dis
trict court.
Sec. 152. Any probate judge may present a claim against the estate
of a decedent for allowance, to the executor or administrator thereof ;
and if the executor or administrator allows the claim, he must, in writ
ing, designate some probate judge of an adjoining county, who, upon
the presentation of such claim to him, is vested with the same power
to allow or reject it as he would have if the will had been proved or
administration granted in his own county ; and the probate judge pre
senting such claim, in case of its rejection by the executor or adminis
trator, or by such probate judge as shall have acted upon it, has the
same right to sue m a proper court for its recovery as other persons
have when their claims against an estate are rejected.
Sec. 153. When a claim, accompanied by the affidavit required in
this chapter, is presented to the executor or administrator, he must
endorse thereon nis allowance or rejection, with the day and date
thereof. If he allows the claim, it must be presented to the probate
judge for his approval, who must, in the same manner, endorse upon
it his allowance or rejection. If the executor or administrator or the
judge refuse or neglect to endorse such allowance or rejection for ten
days after the claim has been presented to him, such refusal or neglect
is equivalent to a rejection on the tenth day ; and if the presentation
be made by a notary, the certificate of such notary, under seal, is prima
faciei evidence of such presentation and rejection. If the claim be pre
sented to the executor or administrator before the expiration of the
time limited for the presentation of claims, the same is presented in
time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator and by the
judge after the expiration of such time. If the claim be payable in a
particular kind of money or currency, it shall, if allowed, be payable
only in such money or currency.
Sec. 154. Every claim allowed by the executor or administrator and
approved by the probate judge, or a copy thereof, as hereinafter provi
ded, must, within thirty days thereafter, be filed in the probate court,
and be ranked amongthe acknowledged debts of the estate, to be paid in
due course of administration. If the claim is founded on a bond, bill,
note, or any other instrument, a copy of such instrument must accomSany
the claim, and the original instrument must be exhibited if
emanded, onless it is lost or destroyed, in which case the claimant
must accompany his claim by his affidavit, containing a copy or par
ticular description of such instrument, and stating its loss or destruction.
If the claim or any part thereof is secured by a mortgage or other lien,
which has been recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in
which the land affected by it lies^ in which case it is sufficient to des
cribe the mortgage or lien and refer to the date, volume, and page of its
record.
If in any case the claimant has left any original voucher in the hands
of the executor or administrator, or suffered the same to be filed in
court, he may withdraw the same when a copy thereof has been already
or is then attached to his claim. A brief description of the claim filed
must be entered by the clerk in the register, showing the name of the
claimant, the amount and character of the claim, rate of interest and
date of allowance.
Sec. 155. When a claim is rejected, either by the executor or
administrator or the probate judge, the holder must bring suit in the
proper court against the executor or administrator, within three months
after date of its rejection, if it be then due, or within two months after
it becomes due, otherwise the claim is forever barred.
Sec. 156. No claim must be allowed by the executor or administra
tor, or by the probate judge, which is barred by the statute of limita
tions. When a claim is presented to the probate judge for his allow
ance, he may, in his discretion, examine the claimant and others, on
oath, and hear any other legal evidence touching the validity of the
claim.
Sec. 157. No holder of any claim against an estate shall maintain
any action thereon, unless the claim is first presented to the executor
or administrator.
Sec. 158. The time during which there shall be a vacancy in the
administration must not be included in any limitations herein pre
scribed.
Sec. 159. If an action is pending against the decedent at the time
of his death, the plaintiff must in like manner present his claim to the
executor or administrator, for allowance or rejection, authenticated as
required in other cases ; and no recovery shall be had in the action
unless proof be made of the presentation required.
Sec. 160. Whenever any claim is presented to an executor or
administrator, or to the probate judge, and he is willing to allow the
same in part, he must state in his endorsement the amount he is will
ing to allow. If the creditor refuse to accept the amount allowed in
satisfaction of his claim, he shall recover no costs in any action
therefor brought against the executor or administrator, unless he
recovers a greater amount than that offered to be allowed.
Sec. 161. A judgment rendered against an executor or administra
tor upon any claim for money against the estate of his testator or
intestate, only establishes the claim in the same manner as if it had
been allowed by the executor or administrator and the probate judge,
and the judgment must be that the execiitor or administrator pay in
due course of administration the amount ascertained to be due. A
certified transcript of the judgment must be filed in the probate court.
No execution must issue upon such judgment, nor shall it create any
lien upon the property of the estate or give to the judgment creditor
any priority of payment.
Sec. 162. When judgment has been rendered for or against the tes
tator (or) intestate in his lifetime, no execution shall issue thereon
after his death, except as provided in section 306 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. A judgment against the decedent for the recovery of
money must be presented to the executor or administrator, like any
other claim. If execution is actually levied upon any property of the
decedent before his death, the same may be sold for the satisfaction
thereof ; and the officer making the sale must account to the executor
or administrator for any surplus in his hands. A judgment creditor
having a judgment which was rendered against the testator or intestate
in his lifetime, may redeem any real estate of the decedent from any
sale under foreclosure or execution, in like manner and with like effect
as if the judgment debtor were still living.
Sec. 163. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying after a
verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment is rendered
thereon, is not a lien on the real property of the decedent, but is paya
ble in due course of administration.
Sec. 164. If the executor or administrator doubts the correctness
of any claim presented to him, he may enter into an agreement, in
writing, with the claimant, to refer the matter in controversy to some
disinterested person, to be approved by the probate judge ; upon filing
the agreement and approval of the probate judge in the office of the
clerk of the district court for the county in which the letters testamen
tary or of administration were granted, the clerk must, either in
vacation or in term, enter a minute of the order referring the matter
in controversy to the person so selected ; or, if the parties consent, a
reference may be had to the probate court, and the report of the
referee, if confirmed, establishes or rejects the claim the same as if it
had been allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator and the
probate judge.
Sec. 165. The referee must hear and determine the matter and
make his report thereon to the court in which his appointment is
entered. The same proceedings shall' be had in all respects, and the
referee shall have the same powers, be entitled to the same compensa
tion, and subject to the same control, as in other cases of reference.
The court may remove the referee, appoint another in his place, set
aside or confirm his report, and adjudge costs, as in actions against
executors or administrators, and the judgment of tha court thereon
shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if the same had been
rendered in a suit commenced by ordinary process.
Sec. 166. When a judgment is recovered with costs against any
executor or administrator, he shall be individually liable for such costs ;
but they must be allowed him in his administration accounts, unless it
appears that the suit or proceeding in which the costs were taxed was
prosecuted or defended without just cause.
Sec. 167. If the executor or administrator is a creditor of the dece
dent, his claim, duly authenticated by affidavits, must be presented for
allowance or rejection to the probate judge, and its allowance by the
judge is sufficient evidence of its correctness, and it must be paid as
other claims, in due course of administration. If, however, the probate
judge rejects the claim, action thereon may be had against the estate
by the claimant, and summons must be served upon the probate judge,
who may appoint an attorney at the expense of the estate to defend the
action. If the claimant recovers no judgment, he must pay all costs,
including defendant's fees.
Sec. 168. If any executor or administrator neglects for two months
after his appointment to give notice to creditors, as prescribed by this chapter, the court must revoke his letters, and appoint some other per
son in his stead, equally or the next in order entitled to the appoint
ment.
Sec. 169. At the same term at which he is required to return his
inventory, the executor or administrator must also return a statement
of all claims against the estate which have been presented to him, if so
required by the court ; and from term to term thereafter he must pre
sent a statement of claims subsequently presented to him. In all such
statements he must designate the names of the creditors, the nature of
each claim, when it became due, or will become due, and whether it
was allowed or rejected'by him.
Sec. 170. If there be any debt of the decedent bearing interest,
whether presented or not, the executor or administrator may, by order
of the court, pay the amount then accumulated and unpaid, or any
part thereof, at any time when there are sufficient funds properly appli
cable thereto, whether said claim be then due or not ; and interest shall
thereupon cease to accrue upon the amount so paid. This section
does not apply to existing debts, unless the creditor consent to accept
the amount.
CHAPTER VII.
ARTICLE I.
SALES IN GENERAL.
Sec. 171. Property of deceased liable for debts.
Sec. 172. Proceedings when money is borrowed for estate.
Sec. 173. Salop of property; order of court.
Sec. 174. Petition for order of sale.
Sec. 175. When estate insolvent or just sufficient to pay all claims,'only
one sale made.
Sec. 171. All the property of a decedent shall be chargeable with
the payment of the debts of the deceased, the expenses of administra
tion, and the allowance to the family, except as otherwise provided in
this code and in the civil code. And the said property, personal and
real, may be sold as the court may direct, in the manner prescribed in
this chapter. There shall be no priority as between personal and real
property for the above purposes.
Sec. 172. In all cases the executor or administrator of an estate,
instead of selling the property of the estate to pay the charges and
domands against the same, may borrow money at the lowest rate of
interest at which it may be had, and for such length of time the court
may allow, to pay such claims, when it shall be made to appear to the
court, by petition and evidence, that an immediate sale of the property
of the estate will be detrimental to the heirs, devisees, legatees, or
other persons having an interest therein ; and in such case the estate
shall be chargeable with the payment of such sum so borrowed and
interest thereon. Such petition may be made by the executor or
administrator, or by any one of the heirs of the deceased, or other per
son interested in the estate. Notice shall be given as "follows: If by
the executor or administrator, to all the heirs, devisees, legatees resid
ing in the territory; and if by any heir, devisee, or legatee, to the
administrator or executor, and to all other heirs, devisees and legatees
residing in the Territory, which notice shall be given as notice to
creditors by an executor or administrator is required by the provisions
of this act. â– Â»
Sec. 178. No sale of any property of an estate of a decedent is valid
unless made under order of the probate court, except as otherwise pro
vided in this chapter. All sales must be reported under oath, and con
firmed by the probate court, before the title to the property sold
passes.
Sec. 174. All petitions for orders of sale must be in writing, setting
forth the facts showing the sale to be necessary, and, upon the hearing,
any person interested in the estate may file his written objections, which
must be heard and determined. A failure to set forth the facts show
ing the sale to be necessary will not invalidate the subsequent proceed
ings, if the defect be supplied by the proofs at the hearing, and the
general facts showing the necessity be stated in the order directing the
sale.
Sec. 175. When it appears to the court that the estate is. insolvent,
or that it will require a sale of all the property of the estate of every
character, to pay the family allowance, expenses of administration, and
debts, there need be but one petition filed, but one order of sale made,
and but one sale had, except in the case of perishable property, which
may be sold as provided in section 176. The probate court, when a
petition for the sale of any property for any of the purposes herein
named is presented, must inquire fully into the probable amount
required to make all such payments, and if there be no more estate
than sufficient to pay the same, may require but one proceeding for the
sale of the entire estate. In such case the petition must set forth sub
stantially the facts required by section 187.
ARTICLE II.
SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.
Sec. 176. Sale of perishable and other property to pay family allowance.
Sec. 177. Sale of part or whole of personal property.
Sec. 178. Interests in partnership and pledged property and choses in
action may be sold.
Sec. 179. When property must be sold and the order in which sold.
Sec. 180. Public sale; real property sold in certain cases.
Sec. 176. At any time after receiving letters the executor, adminis
trator, or special administrator may apply to the court or judge, and
obtain an order to sell perishable and other personal property likely to
depreciate in value, or which will incur loss or expense by being kept,
and so much other personal property as may be necessary to pay the
allowance made to the family-of the decedent. The order for the sale
may be made without notice, but the executor, administrator, or special
administrator is responsible for the property, unless, after making a
sworn return and on a proper showing, the court shall approve the
sale.
Sec. 177. If claims against the estate have been allowed and a sale
of property is necessary for their payment, or the expenses of adminis
tration, or for the payment of legacies, the executor or administrator
may apply for an order to sell so much of the personal property as may
be necessary therefor. Upon filing his petition, notice of at least five
days must be given of the hearing of the application, either by posting
notices or by advertising. He may also make a similar application,
either in vacation or term, from time to time, so long as any personal
property remains in his hands and sale thereof is necessary. If it
appear for the best interest of the estate, he may, at any time after
filing the inventory, in like manner, and after giving like notice, apply
for and obtain an order to sell the whole of .the personal property
belonging to the estate, whether necessary to pay debts or not.
Sec. 178. Partnership interest, or interests belonging to any estate
by virtue of any partnership formerly existing, interests in personal
property pledged, and choses in action, may be sold in the same man
ner as other personal property, when it appears to be for the best inter
est of the estate. Before confirming the sale of any partnership
interest, whether made to the surviving partner or to any other person,
the court or judge must carefully inquire into the condition of the
partnership affairs, and must examine the surviving partner, if in the
county and able to be present in court.
Sec. 179. If it appears that a sale is necessary for the payment of
debts or the family allowance, or for the best interest of the estate and
the persons interested in the property to be sold, whether it is or is not
necessary to pay the debts or family allowance, the court or judge must
order it to be made. In making orders and sales for the payment of
debts or family allowance, such articles as are not necessary for the
support and subsistence of the family of the decedent, or are not espe
cially bequeathed, must be first sold, and the court or judge must so
direct.
Sec. 180. The sale of personal property must be made at public
auction, for such money or currency as the court may direct, and after
public notice given for at least ten days, by notices posted in three
public places in the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both,
containing the time and place of sale, and a brief description of the
property to be sold, unless, for good reasons shown, the probate court
or judge orders a private sale or a shorter notice. Public sales of such
property must be made at the court house door, or at the residence of
the decedent, or at some other public place, but no sale shall be made
of any personal property which is not present at the time of sale, unless
the court otherwise order. When a sale of property of the estate is
necessary to pay the allowance of the family, or the debts outstanding
against the decedent, or the debts, expenses, or charges of administra
tion, or legacies, the executor or administrator may also sell any real
as well as personal property of the estate, for that purpose, upon the
order of the probate court ; and an application for the sale of real
property may also embrace the sale of personal property.
Sec. 181. When it appears from the inventory of the estate of any
decedent that his estate consists, in whole or in part, of mines or inter
ests in mines, or of shares, interests, or stocks in a mining corporation,
such mines, interests, stocks, or shares may be sold under the order of
the probate court having jurisdiction of the estate, as hereinafter
provided.
Sec. 182. The executor, administrator, or any heir at law or creditor
of the estate, any partner or member of any mining company in which
interests or shares are held or owned by the estate, may file in the
probate court a petition, in writing, setting forth the general facts of
the estate being then in due course of administration, and particularly
describing the mine, interest, or shares, which it is desired to sell, and
particularly the condition and situation of the mines or mining inter
ests, or of the mining company or corporation in which such interests
or shares are held, and the grounds upon which the sale is asked to be
made.
Sec. 183. Upon the presentation of such petition the probate judge
must make an order directing all persons interested to appear before
him at a time and place specified, not less than four nor more than ten
weeks from the time of making such order, to show cause why an order
should not be granted to the executor or administrator to sell such
mines, mining interests, shares, or stocks, as are set forth in the peti
tion and belonging to the estate. A copy of the order to show cause
must be personally served on all persons interested in the estate at
least ten days before the time appointed for hearing the petition, or
published atjeast four successive weeks in such newspaper as the court
shall specify. If all persons interested in the estate signify in writing
their assent to such sale, the notice may be dispensed with.
Sec. 184. If, upon hearing the petition, it appears to the satisfac
tion of the probate judge that it is to the interest of the estate that
such mining property or interests of the estate should be sold ; or if it
appears to his satisfaction that an immediate sale is necessary in order
to secure the just rights or interests of the mining partners or tenants
in common, in which such shares, stocks, or property are held, such
probate judge must make an order authorizing the executor or adminis
trator to sell such mining interests, mines, or shares, as hereinafter
provided.
Sec. 185. After the order of sale is made, all further proceedings
for the sale of such mining property, and for the notice, report, and
confirmation thereof, must be in conformity with the provisions of Article IV of this chapter.
Sec. 186. When the personal estate in the hands of the executor or
administrator is exhausted, or insufficient to pay the allowance of the
family, the debts outstanding against the decedent, and the debts,
expenses, and charges of administration, the executor or administrator
may sell the real estate for that purpose, upon the order of the probate
court.
Sec. 187. To obtain an order for the sale of real property, he must
Eresent a verified petition to the probate court, or to the judge at cham-
ers, setting forth the amount of personal property that has come to
his hands, and how much thereof, if any, remains undisposed of ; the
debts outstanding against the decedent, as far as can be ascertained or
estimated ; the amount due upon the family allowance, or that will be
due after the same has been in force for one year ; the debts, expenses,
and charges of administration already accrued, and an estimate of what
will or may accrue during the administration ; a general discription of
all the real property of which the decedent died seized, or in which he
had any interest, or in which the estate has acquired any interest, and
the condition and value thereof, and whether the same be community
or separate property ; the names of the legatees and devisees, if any,
and of the heirs of the decedent, so far as known to the petitioner. If
any of the matters here enumerated cannot be ascertained, it must be
so stated in the petition ; but a failure to set forth the facts showing
the sale to be necessary will not invalidate the subsequent proceedings,
if the defect be supplied by the proofs at the hearing, and the general
facts showing such necessity be stated in the decree.
Sec. 188. If it appear to the court or judge from such petition that
it is necessary to sell the whole or some portion of the real estate for
the purposes and reasons mentioned in the preceding section, or any of
them, such petition must be filed, and an order thereupon made direct
ing all persons interested in the estate to appear before the court, at a
time and place specified, not less than four nor more than ten weeks
from the time of making such order, to show cause why an order should
not be granted to the executor or administrator to sell so much of the
real estate of the decedent as is necessary.
Sec. 189. A copy of the order to show cause must be personally
served on all persons interested in the estate, any general guardian of
a minor so interested, and any legatee, or devisee, or heir of the dece
dent, provided they are residents of the county, at least ten days before
the time appointed for hearing the petition, or be published four succes
sive weeks in such newspaper in the county as the court or judge shall
direct. If all persons interested in the estate join in the petition for
the sale, or signify in writing their assent thereto, the notice may be
dispensed with, and the hearing may be had at any time.
Sec. 190. The probate court, at the time and place appointed in
such order, or at such other time to which the hearing may be post
poned, upon satisfactory proof of personal service or publication of a
copy of the order, by affidavit or otherwise, if the consent, in writing,
to such sale, of all parties interested is not filed, must proceed to hear
the petition, and hear and examine the allegations and proofs of the
petitioners, and of all persons interested in the estate who may oppose
the application. All claims against the decedent not before presented,
if the period of presentation has not elapsed, may be presented and
passed upon at the hearing.
Sec. 191. The executor, administrator, and witnesses may be
examined on oath by either party, and process to compel them to
attend and testify may be issued by the probate judge, in the same
manner and with like effect as in other cases.
Sec. 192. If it appears necessary to sell a part of the real estate,
and that by a sale thereof the residue of the estate, real or personal,
or some specific part thereof, would be greatly injured, or diminished
in value, or subjected to expense, or rendered unprofitable, or that
after any such sale the residue would be so small in quantity or value,
or would be of such a character with reference to its future disposition
among the heirs or devisees, as clearly to render it for the best interest
of all concerned that the same should be sold, the court may authorize
the sale of the whole estate or any part thereof necessary and for the
best interests of all concerned.
Sec. 193. If the court is satisfied, after a full hearing upon the
petition and an examination of the proofs and allegations of the parties
interested, that a sale of the whole or some portion of the real estate
is necessary for any of the causes mentioned in this article, or if such
sale be assented to by all the persons interested, an order must be
made to sell the whole, or so much and such parts of the real estate
described in the petition as the court shall judge necessary or benefi
cial.
Sec. 194. The order of sale must describe the lands to be sold and
the terms of sale, which may be for cash or on a credit not exceeding
one year, payable in gross or installments, and in such kind of money,
with interest, as the court may direct. The land may be sold in one
parcel or in subdivisions, as the executor or administrator shall judge
most beneficial to the estate, unless the court otherwise specially
directs. If it appears that any of such real estate has been devised
and not charged in such devise with the payment of debts or legacies,
the court must order the remainder to be sold before that so devised.
Every such sale must be ordered to be made at public auction, unless
in the opinion of the court it would benefit the estate to sell the whole
or some part of such real estate at private sale. The court may, if the
same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such real estate, or
any part thereof, to be sold at either public or private sale, as the
executor or administrator shall judge to be most beneficial for the
estate.
If the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale
under the order and as directed therein, he may be compelled to sell,
by order of the court, made on motion, after due notice, by any party
interested.
Sec. 195. If the executor or administrator neglects to apply for an
order of sale when it is necessary, any person may make application
therefor, in the same manner as the executor or administrator, and
notice thereof must be given to the executor or administrator before
the hearing. The petition of such applicant must contain as many of
the matters in section 179 as he can ascertain, and the decree of the
sale must fix the period of time within which the executor or adminis
trator must make the sale.
Sec. 196. When a sale is ordered, and is to be made at public
auction, notice of the time and place of sale must be posted up in three
of the most public places in the county in which the land is situated,
and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed in the same
county, but if none, then in such paper as the court may direct, for
three weeks successively next before the sale ; the lands and tenements
to be sold must be described with common certainty in the notice.
Sec. 197. Sales at public auction must be made in the county
where the land is situated, but when the land is situated in two or
more counties it may be sold in either. The sale must be made
between the hours of nine o'clock in the morning and the setting of
the sun on the same day, and must be made on the day named in
notice of sale, unless the same is postponed.
Sec. 198. When a sale of real estate is ordered to be made at pri
vate sale, notice of the same must be posted up in three of the most
Eublic places in the county in which the land is situated, and pub-
shed in a newspaper, if there be one printed in the same county,
if none, then in such paper as the court may direct, for two weeks
successively next before the day on or after which the sale is to be
made, in which the lands and tenements to be sold must be described
with common certainty. The notice must state a day on or after
which the sale will be made, and a place where offers or bids will be
received. The day last referred to must be at least fifteen days from
the first publication of notice, and the sale must not be made before
that day, but must be made within six months thereafter. The bids
or offers must be in writing, and may be left at the place designated in
the notice, or delivered to the executor or administrator personally, or
may be filed in the office of the clerk of the probate court, to which
the return of sale must be made, at any time after the first publication
of the notice and before the making of the sale.
If it is shown that it will be for the best interest of the estate, the
court or judge may, by an order, shorten the time of notice, which
shall not, however, be less than one week, and may provide that the
sale may be made on or after a day less than fifteen but not less than
eight days from the first publication of the notice of sale, and the sale
may be made to correspond with such order.
Sec. 199. No sale of real estate at private sale shall be confirmed
by the court unless the sum offered is at least ninety per cent, of the
appraised value thereof, nor unless such real estate has been appraised
within one year of the time of such sale. If it has not been so appraised,
or if the court is satisfied that the appraisement is too high or too low,
appraisers must be appointed, and they must make an appraisement
thereof in the same manner as in the case of an original appraisement
of an estate. This may be done at any time before the sale or con
firmation thereof.
Sec. 200. The executor or administrator must, when the sale is
made upon a credit, take the notes of the purchaser for the purchase
money, with a mortgage on the property to secure their payment.
Sec. 201. The executor or admmistrator, after making any sale of
real estate, must make a return of his proceedings to the probate court,
which must be filed in the office of the clerk at any time subsequent to
the sale, either in term or vacation. If the sale is made at public
auction and the return made and filed on or before the first day of the
next term thereafter, no notice is required of such return, or of the
hearing thereof, but the hearing may be had upon the first day of the
term, or any subsequent day to which the same may be postponed. If
I
the sale be not made at public auction, or, if made at public auction,
a hearing upon the return of proceedings be asked for in the return, or
is brought on for a hearing upon a day before the first day of the next
term after such sale, the court or judge must fix the day for the hear
ing, of which notice of at least ten days must be given by the clerk,
by notices posted in three public places in the county, or by publica
tion in a newspaper, or both, as the court or judge shall direct, and
must briefly indicate the land sold, the sum for which it was sold, and
must refer to the return for further particulars. â€¢ Upon the hearing the
court must examine the return and witnesses in relation to the same,
and if the proceedings were unfair, or the sum bid disproportionate to
the value, and that a sum exceeding such bid, at least ten per cent,
exclusive of the expenses of a new sale, may be obtained, the court
may vacate the sale and direct another to be had, of which notice must
be given, and the sales in all respects conducted as if no previous sale
had taken place. If an offer of ten per cent, more in amount than
that named in the return be made to the court in writing by a responsi
ble person, it is in the discretion of the court to accept such offer and
confirm the sale to such person, or to order a new sale.
Sec. 202. When return of the sale is made and filed, any person
interested in the estate may file written objections to the confirmation
thereof, and may be heard thereon when the return is heard by the
court or judge, and may produce witnesses in support of his objections.
Sec. 203. If it appears to the court that the sale was legally made
and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was not disproportionate to
the value of the property sold, and that a greater sum as above
specified cannot be obtained, or if the increased bid mentioned in section 201 be made and accepted by the court, the court must make
an order confirming the sale and directing conveyances to be executed.
The sale from that time is confirmed and valid ; and a certified copy
of the order confirming it and directing conveyances to be executed,
must be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county within
which the land sold is situated. If, after the confirmation, the pur-
. chaser neglects or refuses to comply with the terms of sale, the court
may, on motion of the executor or administrator, and after notice to
the purchaser, order a re-sale to be made of the property. If the
amount realized on such re-sale does not cover the bid and expenses of
the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the deficiency to the
estate.
Sec. 204. Conveyances must thereupon be executed to the purchaser
by the executor or administrator, and they must refer to the orders of
the probate court authorizing and confirming the sale of the property
of the estate, and directing the conveyances thereof to be executed,
and to the record of the confirmation, in the office of the county
recorder, either by the date of such recording or by the date, volume
and page of the record, and such references shall have the same effect
as if the order were at large inserted in the conveyance. Conveyances
so made convey all the right, title, interest and estate of the decedent
in the premises at the time of his death, if prior to the sale, by opera
tion of law or otherwise, the estate has acquired any right, title or
interest in the premises other than or in addition to that of the dece
dent at the time of his death, such right, title or interest also passes by
such conveyance.
Sec. 205. Before any order is entered confirming the sale, it must
be proved to the satisfaction of the court that notice was given of the
sale as prescribed, and the order of confirmation must show that such
proof was made.
Sec. 206. If, at the time appointed for the sale, the executor or
administrator deems it for the interest of all persons concerned therein
that the same be postponed, he may postpone it from time to time, not
exceeding in all three months.
Sec. 207. In case of a postponement, notice thereof must be given
by public declaration at the time and place first appointed for the sale,
and if the postponement be for more than one day, further notice must
be given by posting notices in three or more public places in the county
where the land is situated, or publishing the same, or both, as the time
and circumstances will admit.
Sec. 208. If the testator makes provision by his will, or designates
the estate to be appropriated for the payment of his debts, the
expenses of administration, or family expenses, they must be paid
according to such provision or designation, out of the estate thus
appropriated, so far as the same is sufficient.
Sec. 209. When property is directed by the will to be sold, or
authority is given in the will to sell property, the executor may sell any
property of the estate without the order of the probate court, and at
either public or private sale, and with or without notice, as the executor
may determine ; but the executor must make return of such sales as in
other cases ; and if directions are given in the will as to the mode of
selling, or the particular property to be sold, such directions must be
observed. In either case no title passes unless the sale is confirmed by
the court.
Sec. 210. If the provision made by the will, or the estate appro
priated therefor, is insufficient to pay the debts, expenses of adminis
tration, and family expenses, that portion of the estate not devised or
disposed of by the will, if any, must be appropriated and disposed of
for that purpose, according to the provisions of this chapter.
Sec. 211. The estate, real and personal, given by will to legatees or
devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of administration, and family
expenses, in proportion to the value or amount of the several devises or
legacies, but specific devises or legacies are exempt from such liability
if it appears to the c^purt necessary to carry into effect the intention of
the testator, and there is other sufficient estate.
Sec. 212. When an estate, given by will, has been sold for the pay
ment of debts or expenses, all the devisees and legatees must contribute
according to their respective interests to the devisee or legatee whose
devise or legacy has been taken therefor, and the probate court, when
distribution is made, must, by decree for that purpose, settle the
amount of the several liabilities and decree the amount each person
shall contribute, and reserve the same from their distributive shares
respectively for the purpose of paying such contribution.
Sec. 218. If a decedent, at the time of his death, was possessed of
a contract for the purchase of lands, his interest in such land and
under such contracts may be sold, on the application of his executor
or administrator, in the same manner as if he had died seized of such
lands, and the same proceedings may be had for that purpose as are
prescribed in this chapter for the sale of lands of which he died seized,
except as hereinafter provided.
Sec. 214. The sale must be made subject to all payments that may
thereafter become due on such contracts, and if there are any such the
sale must not be confirmed by the probate judge until the purchasers
execute a bond to the executor or administrator for the benefit and
indemnity of himself and of the persons entitled to the interest of the
decedent in the lands so contracted for, in double the whole amount of
payments thereafter to become due on such contract, with sureties as
the probate judge shall approve.
Sec. 215. The bond must be conditioned that the purchaser will
make all payments for such land that become due after the date of the
sale, and will fully indemnify the executor or administrator and the
Eersons so entitled against all demands, costs, charges, and expenses,
y reason of any covenant or agreement contained in such contract.
Sec. 216. Upon the confirmation of the sale the executor or admin
istrator must execute to the purchaser an assignment of the contract,
which vests in the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, all the right, title,
and interest of the estate, or of the persons entitled to the interest of
the decedent in the lands sold at the time of the sale, and the pur
chaser has the same rights and remedies against the vendor of such
land as the decedent would have had if he were living.
Sec. 217. When any sale is made by an executor or administrator,
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, of lands subject to any
mortgage or other lien which is a valid claim against the estate of the
decedent, and has been presented and allowed, the purchase money
must be applied, after paying the necessary expenses of the sale, first,
to the payment and satisfaction of the mortgage or lien, and the resi
due, if any, in due course of administration. The application of the
purchase money to the satisfaction of the mortgage or lien must be
made without delay, and the land is subject to such mortgage or lien
until the purchase money has been actually so applied. No claim
against any estate, which has been presented and allowed, is affected
by the statute of limitations, pending the proceedings for the settle
ment of the estate.
The purchase money, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to pay
such mortgage or lien, with interest, and any lawful costs and charges
thereon, may be paid into the probate court, to be received by the clerk
thereof, whereupon the mortgage or lien upon the land must cease ;
and the purchase money must be paid over by tlie clerk of the court
without delay, in payment of the expenses of the sale, and in satisfac
tion of the debt to secure which the mortgage or other lien was taken,
and the surplus, if any, at once returned to the executor or adminis
trator, unless, for good 'cause shown, after notice to the executor or
administrator, the court otherwise directs.
Sec. 218. At any sale, under order of the probate court, of lands
upon which there is a mortgage or lien, the holder thereof may become
the purchaser, and his receipt for the amount due him from the pro
ceeds of the sale is a payment pro tanto. If the amount for which he
purchased the property is insufficient to defray the expenses and dis
charge his mortgage or lien, he must pay to the court or the clerk
thereof an amount sufficient to pay such expenses.
Sec. 219. If there is any neglect or misconduct in the proceedings
of the executor in relation to any sale, by which any person interested
in the estate suffers damage, the party aggrieved may recover the same
in an action upon the bond of the executor or administrator, or oth
erwise.
Sec. 220. Any executor or administrator who fraudulently sells any
real estate of a decedent, contrary to or otherwise than under the pro->
visions of this chapter, is liable in double the value of the land sold,
as liquidated damages, to be recovered in an action by the person
having an estate of inheritance therein.
Sec. 221. No action for the recovery of any estate sold by an
executor or administrator under the provisions of this chapter, can be
maintained by any heir or other person claiming under the decedent,
unless it be commenced within three years next after the sale. An
action to set aside the sale may he instituted and maintained at any
time within three years from the discovery of the fraud, or other
grounds upon which the action is based.
Sec. 222. The preceding section shall not apply to minors or others
under any legal disability to sue at the time when the right of action
first accrues, but all such persons may commence an action at any
time within three years after the removal of the disability.
Sec. 223. When a sale has been made by an executor or adminis
trator of any property of the estate, real or personal, he must return to
the probate court, at its next term thereafter, an account of sales,
verified by his affidavit. If he neglects to make such return he may
be punished by attachment, or his letters may be revoked, one day's
notice having been first given him to appear and show cause why such
attachment should not issue, or such revocation should not be made.
Sec. 224. No executor or administrator must, directly or indirectly,
purchase any property of the estate he represents, nor must he be
interested in any such sale.

Sec. 225. The executor or administrator must take into his posses
sion all the estate of the decedent, real or personal, and collect all
debts due to the decedent or to the estate. For the purpose of bring
ing suits to quiet title, or for partition of such estate, the possession of
the executors or administrators is the possession of the heirs or
devisees ; such possession by the heirs or devisees is subject, however,
to the possession of the executor or administrator for the purposes of
administration, as provided in this title.
Sec. 226. Actions for the recovery of any property, real or per
sonal, or for the possession thereof, and all actions founded upon con
tracts, may be maintained by and against executors and administra
tors in all cases in which the same might have been maintained by or
against their respective testators or intestates.
Sec. 227. Executors and administrators may maintain actions
against any person who has wasted, destroyed, taken or carried away
or converted to his own use, the goods of the testator or intestate in
his lifetime. They may also maintain actions for trespass committed
on the real estate of the decedent in his lifetime.
Sec. 228. Any person, or his personal representatives, may main
tain an action against the executor or administrator of any testator or
intestate who in his lifetime has wasted, destroyed, taken or carried
away, or converted to his own use, the goods or chattels of any such
person, or committed any trespass on the real estate of such person.
Sec. 229. When a partnership exists between the decedent, at the
time of his death, and any other person, the surviving partner has the
right to continue in possession of the partnership, and to settle its
business, but the interest of the decedent in the partnership must be
included in the inventory and be appraised and appropriated as other
property. The surviving partner must settle the affairs of the partner
ship without delay, and account with the executor or administrator,
and pay over such balances as may from time to time be payable to
him in right of the decedent. Upon the application of the executor or
administrator, the probate judge may, whenever it appears necessary,
order the surviving partner to render an account, and in case of neg
lect or refusal may, after notice, compel it by attachment, and the
executor or administrator may maintain against him any action which
the decedent could have maintained.
Sec. 230. An administrator may, in his own name, for the use and
benefit of all parties interested in the estate, maintain actiqns on the
bond of an executor, or of any former administrator of the same
estate.
Sec. 281. In actions by or against executors it is not necessary to
join those as parties to whom letters were issued, but who have not
qualified.
Sec. 282. Whenever a debtor of a decedent is unable to pay all his
debts, the executor or administrator, with the approbation of the pro
bate court or judge, may compound with him and give him a discharge
upon receiving a fair and just dividend of his effects. A compromise
may also be authorized when it appears to be just and for the best
interest of the estate.
Sec. 288. When there is a deficiency of assets in the hands of an
executor or administrator, and when the decedent in his lifetime has
conveyed any real estate or any rights or interests therein with intent
to defraud his creditors, or to avoid any right, debt, or duty of any per
son, or has so conveyed such estate that by law the deeds or convey
ances are void as against creditors, the executor or administrator must
commence and prosecute to final judgment any proper action for the
recovery of the same, and may recover for the benefit of the creditors
all such real estate so fraudulently conveyed, and may also, for the
benefit of the creditors, sue and recover all goods, chattels, rights, or
credits which have been so conveyed by the decedent in his lifetime,
whatever may have been the manner of such fraudulent conveyance.
Sec. 234. No executor or administrator is bound to sue for such
estate as is mentioned in the preceding section, for the benefit of the
creditors, unless on application of creditors, who must pay such part
of the costs and expenses of the suit, or give security to the executor
or administrator therefor, as the probate judge shall direct.
Sec. 235. All real estate so recovered must be sold for the payment
of debts in the same manner as if the decedent had died seized thereof,
upon obtaining an order therefor from the probate court, and the pro
ceeds of all goods, chattels, rights, and credits so recovered must be
appropriated in payment of the debts of the decedent, in the same
manner as other property in the hands of the executor or adminis
trator.

Sec. 236. When a person who is bound by contract, in writing, to
convey any real estate, dies before making the conveyance, and in all
cases where such decedent, if living, might be compelled to make such
conveyance, the probate court may make a decree authorizing and
directing his executor or administrator to convey such real estate to the
person entitled thereto.
Sec. 237. On the presentation of a verified petition by any person
claiming to be entitled to such conveyance from an executor or admin
istrator, setting forth the facts upon which the claim is predicated, the
probate court must appoint a time and place for hearing the petition,
at a regular term of the court, and must order notice thereof to be
published at least four successive weeks before such hearing, in such
newspaper in this Territory as he may designate.
Sec. 238. At the time and place appointed for the hearing, or at
such other time to which the same may be postponed, upon satisfac
tory proof, by affidavit or otherwise, of the due publication of the
notice, the court must proceed to a hearing, and all persons interested
in the estate may appear and contest such petition by filing their objec
tions in writing, and the court may examine, on oath, the petitioner
and all who may be produced before him for that purpose.
Sec. 239. If, after a full hearing upon the petition and objections,
and examination of the facts and circumstances of the claim, the court
is satisfied that the petitioner is entitled to a conveyance of the real
estate described in the petition, a decree authorizing and directing the
executor or administrator to execute a conveyance thereof to the peti
tioner must be made, entered on the minutes of the court, and recorded.
Sec. 240. The executor or administrator must execute the convey
ance according to the directions of the decree, a certified copy of which
must be recorded with the deed in the office of the recorder of the
county where the lands lie, and is prima facie evidence of the correct
ness of the proceedings, and of the authority of the executor or admin
istrator to make the conveyance.
Sec. 241. If, upon hearing in the probate court, as hereinbefore
provided, the right of the petitioner to nave a specific performance of
contract is found to be doubtful, the court must dismiss the petition
without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner, who may, at anytime
within six months thereafter, proceed in the district court to enforce a
specific performance thereof.
Sec. 242. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a decree of the
probate court, as provided in this chapter, shall pass the title to the
estate contracted for as fully as if the contracting party himself was
still living and executed the conveyance.
Sec. 243. A copy of the decree for a conveyance, made by the pro
bate court and duly certified and recorded in the office of the recorder
of the county where the land lies, gives the person entitled tb the con
veyance a right to the possession of the lands contracted for, and to
hold the same according to the terms of the intended conveyance, in
like manner as if they had been conveyed in pursuance of the decree.
Sec. 244. The recording of any decree, as provided in the preceding section, shall not prevent the court making the decree from enforcing
the same by other process.
Sec. 245. If the person entitled to conveyance dies before the com
mencement of proceedings therefor under this chapter, or before the
completion of the conveyance, any person entitled to succeed his rights
in the contract, or the executor or administrator of such decedent, may,
for the benefit of the person so entitled, commence such proceedings or
prosecute any already commenced, and the conveyance must be so
made as to vest the estate in the persons entitled to it, or in the execu
tor or administrator for their benefit.
Sec. 246. The decree provided for in this chapter may direct the
possession of the property therein described to be surrendered to the
person entitled thereto, upon his producing the deed and a certified
copy of the decree, when, by the terms of the contract, possession is
to be surrendered.
Sec. 247. No executor or administrator is chargeable upon any
special promise to answer damages or to pay the debts of the testator
or intestate out of hiB own estate, unless the agreement for that
purpose, or some memorandum or note therefor, is in writing, and
signed by such executor or administrator, or by some other person by
him thereunto specially authorized.
Sec. 248. Every executor and administrator is chargeable in his own
account with the whole of the estate of the decedent which may come
into his possession, at the value of the appraisement contained in the
inventory, except as provided in the following sections, and with all the
interest, profit, and income of the estate.
Sec. 249. He shall not make profit by the increase nor suffer loss
by the decrease or destruction, without his fault, of any part of the
estate. He must account for the excess when he sells any part of the
estate for more than appraisement, and if any is sold for less than the
appraisement he is not responsible for the loss, if the sale has been
justly made.
Sec. 2i0. No executor or administrator is accountable for any debts
due to the decedent, if it appears that they remain uncollected without
his fault.
Sec. 251. He shall be allowed all necessary expenses in the care,
management, and settlement of the estate, including reasonable fees
paid to attorneys for conducting the necessary proceedings or suits in
the probate or other courts, and for his services such fees as provided
in this chapter ; %ut when the decedent, by his will, makes some other
provision for the compensation of his executor, that shall be full com
pensation for his services, unless, by a written instrument filed in the
probate court, he renounces all claims for compensation provided by
the will.
Sec. 252. No administrator or executor shall purchase any claim
against the estate he represents, and if he pays any claim for less than
its nominal value, he is only entitled to charge in his account the
amount he actually paid.
Sec. 258. When no compensation is provided by the will or the
executor renounces all claim thereto, he must be allowed commissions
upon the amount of the whole estate accounted for by him, as follows :
For the first thousand dollars at the rate of seven per cent ; for all
above that sum at the rate of four per cent ; and the same commission
must be allowed administrators. In all cases such further allowance
may be made as the probate judge may deem just and reasonable for
any extraordinary service ; the total amount of such allowance must
not exceed the amount of commissions allowed by this section, and
that public administrators shall receive the same compensation and
allowances as are allowed in this Title to other administrators.

Sec. 255. If the executor or administrator fails to render an exhibit
at the third term of the court, the judge of the probate court must cause
a citation to be issued requiring him to appear and render it.
Sec. 256. Any person interested in the estate may, at any time
before the final settlement of accounts, present his petition to the
probate judge, praying that the executor or administrator be required
to appear and render such exhibit, setting forth the facts showing that
it is necessary and proper that such an exhibit should be made.
Sec. 257. If the judge is satisfied, either from the oath of the
applicant or from any other testimony offered, that the facts alleged
are true, and considers the showing of the applicant sufficient, he must
direct a citation to be issued to the executor or administrator, requiring
him to appear at some day to be named in the citation, which must be
during a term of the court, and render an exhibit as prayed for.
Sec. 258. When an exhibit is rendered by an executor or adminis
trator, any person interested may appear, and, by objections in writing,
eontest any account or statement therein contained. The court may
examine the executor or administrator, and if he has been guilty of
neglect, or has wasted, embezzled, or mismanaged the estate, his
letters must be revoked.
Sec. 259. If any executor or administrator neglects or refuses to
appear and render an exhibit, after having been duly cited, an attach
ment may be issued against him, and such exhibit enforced, or his
letters may be revoked in the discretion of the court.
Sec. 260. Every executor or administrator must render a full
account and a report of his administration at the expiration of one
year from the time of his appointment. If he fails to present his
account the court or judge must compel the rendering of the account
by attachment, and any person interested in the estate may apply for
and obtain an attachment ; but no attachment must issue unless a cita
tion has been first issued, served, and returned, requiring the executor
or administrator to appear and show cause why an attachment should
not issue. Every account rendered must exhibit not only the debts
which have been paid, but also a statement of all debts which have
been duly presented and allowed during the period embraced in the
account.
Sec. 261. When the authority of an executor or administrator ceases
or is revoked for any reason, he may be cited to account before the
probate court, at the instance of the person succeeding to the adminis
tration of the same estate, in like manner as he might have been cited
by any person interested in the estate during the time he was exe
cutor or administrator.
Sec. 262. If the executor or administrator resides out of the county,
or absconds, or conceals himself so that the citation can not be per
sonally served, and neglects to render an account within thirty days
after the time prescribed in this article, or if he neglects to render an
account within thirty days after being committed, where the attach
ment has been executed, his letters must be revoked.
Sec. 263. In rendering his account the executor or administrator
must produce and file vouchers for all charges, debts, claims, and
expenses which he has paid, which must remain in the court ; and he may
be examined on oath touching such payments, and also touching any
property and effects of the decedent, and the disposition thereof.
When any voucher is required for other purposes, it may be withdrawn
on leaving a certified copy on file ; if a voucher is lost, or for other
good reasons cannot be produced on the settlement, the payment may
be proved by the oath of any competent witness.
Sec. 264. On the settlement of his account he may be allowed any
item of expenditure, not exceeding twenty dollars, for which no voucher
is produced, if such item be supported by his own uncontradicted oath,
positive to the fact of payment, specifying when, where, and to whom
it was made ; but such allowance, in the whole, must not exceed five
hundred dollars against any one estate.
Sec. 265. When any account is rendered for settlement, the court
or judge must appoint a day for the settlement thereof. The clerk
must thereupon give notice thereof, by causing notices to be posted in
at least three public places in the county, setting forth the name of the
estate, the executor or administrator, and the day appointed for the
settlement of the account, which must be on some day of a term of the
court. The court or probate judge may order such further notice to be
given as may be proper.
Sec. 266. If the account mentioned in the preceding section be for
a final settlement, and the estate be ready for distribution, the notice
of the settlement must state those facts, and must be served, published,
or waived in the same manner as provided in section 180 of this code,
relating to sales of property ; and on confirmation of the final account,
distribution and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto may be
immediately had without further notice or proceedings. If, from any
cause, the hearing of the account or the partition and distribution be
postponed, the order postponing the same to a day certain is notice to
all persons interested therein.
Sec. 267. On the day appointed, or any subsequent day to which
the hearing may be postponed by the court, any person interested in
the estate may appear and file his exceptions in writing to the account,
and contest the same.
Sec. 268. All matters, including allowed claims not passed upon on
the settlement of any former account, or on rendering an exhibit, or on
making a decree of sale, may be contested by the heirs, for cause
shown. The hearing and allegations of the respective parties may be
postponed from time to time, when necessary, and the court may
appoint one or more referees to examine the accounts and make report
thereon, subject to confirmation, and may allow a reasonable compen
sation to the referees, to be paid out of the estate of the decedent.
Sec. 269. The settlement of the account and the allowance thereof
by the court, or upon appeal, is conclusive against all persons in any
way interested in the estate ; saving, however, to all persons laboring
under any legal disability their right to move, for cause, to reopen and
examine the account, or to proceed by action against the executor or
administrator, either individually or upon his bond, at any time before
final distribution, and in any action brought by any such person the al
lowance and settlement of the account is prima facie evidence of its
correctness.
Sec. 270. The account must not be allowed by the court until it is
first proved that notice has been given as required by this chapter, and
the decree must show that such proof was made to the satisfaction of
the court, and is conclusive evidence of the fact.
Sec. 271. Whenever it appears to the court, on any hearing of an
application for the sale of real property, that it would be for the inter
est of the estate that personal property of the estate, or some part of
such property, should be first sold, the court may decree the sale of
such personal property, or any part of it, and the sale thereof shall be
conducted in the same manner as if the application had been made for
the sale of such personal property in the first instance.
Sec. 272. Pending the settlement of any estate, on the petition of
any party interested therein, the probate court may order any moneys
in the hands of the executors or administrators to he invested for the
benefit of the estate in securities of the United States or of this Terri
tory. Such order can only be made after publication of notice of the
petition in some newspaper, to be designated by the judge.
ARTICLE III.
THE PAYMENT OF DEBTS OF THE ESTATE.
Sec. 278. Order in which debts must be paid.
Sec. 274. Payment of mortgage lien, ete.
Sec. 275. Apportionment when assets insufficient.
Sec. 276. Time in which claims to be paid.
Sec. 277. Order of court to pay debts; when account deemed final.
See. 278. Paument of certain claims into court and of rebate of interest.
Sec. 279. Liability when claim is allowed and ordered paid. â€¢
Sec. 280. Remedy when claim is not included in order of payment.
Sec. 2il. Distribution after jMyment of debts.
Sec. 282. Final account after time has been extended.
Sec. 283. .Proceedings upon neglect to render same.
Sec. 273. The debts of the estate must be paid in the following
order :
First. Funeral expenses.
Second. Expenses of last sickness.
Third. The wages of each minor, mechanic, salesman, clerk, ser
vant, or laborer, for services rendered within forty clays next preceding
the death of the employer, not exceeding one hundred dollars.
Fourth. Debts due the county, Territory, or United States.
Fifth. All other demands against the estate, except that where a
lien exists by mortgage, pledge, attachment, or judgment, such lien
shall have preference to the extent of such demand on any specific
property to which such lien may attach.
Sec. 274. The. preference given in the preceding section to a mort
gage only extends to the proceeds of the property mortgaged. If the
proceeds of such property are insufficient to pay the mortgage, the part
remaining unsatisfied must be classed with other demands against the
estate.
Sec. 275. If the estate is insufficient to pay all the debts of any one
class, each creditor must be paid a dividend in proportion to his claim ;
and no creditor of any one class shall receive such payment until all
those of the preceding class are fully paid.
Sec. 276. The executor or administrator, as soon as he has sufficient
funds in his hands, must pay the funeral expenses, and the expenses of
the last sickness, and the allowance made to the family of tlie dece
dent. He may retain in his hands the necessary expenses of adminis
tration, but he is not obliged to pay any other debt, or any legacy, un
til, as prescribed in this article, the payment has been ordered by the
court.
Sec. 277. Upon the settlement of the accounts of the executor or
administrator, at the end of the year, as required in this chapter, the
court must make an order for the payment of the debts, as the circum
stances of the estate require. If there are not sufficient funds in the
hands of the executor or administrator, the court must specify in the
decree the sum to be paid to each creditor. If the whole property of
the estate be exhausted by such payment or distribution, such account
must be considered as a final account, and the executor or administra
tor is entitled to his discharge on producing and filing the necessary
vouchers and proofs, showing that such payments have been made, and
that he has fully complied with the decree of the court.
Sec. 278. If there is any claim not due, or any contingent or dis
puted claim against the estate, the amount thereof, or such part of the
same as the holder would be entitled to if the claim were due, estab
lished, or absolute, must be paid into the court, and there remain to be
paid over to the party when he becomes entitled thereto ; or, if he fails
to establish his claim, to be paid over or distributed as the circum
stances of the estate require. If any creditor whose claim has been al
lowed, but is not yet due, appears and assents to a deduction therefrom
of the legal interest for the time the claim has yet to run, he is entitled
to be paid accordingly. The payments provided for in this section are
not to be made when the estate is insolvent, unless a pro rata distribu
tion is ordered.
Sec. 279. When a decree is made by the probate court for the pay
ment of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally liable to
each creditor for his allowed claim, or the dividend thereon, and execu
tion may be issued on such decree, as upon a judgment in the district
court, in favor of each creditor, and the same proceeding may be had
under such execution as if it had been issued from the district court.
The executor or administrator is liable therefor, on his bond, to each
creditor.
Sec. 280. When the accounts of the administrator or executor have
been settled and an order made for the payment of debts and distribu
tion of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not included in the or
der for payment has any right to call upon the creditors who have been
paid, or upon the heirs, devisees, or legatees, to contribute to the pay
ment of his claim ; but if the executor or administrator has failed to
give the notice to the creditors, as prescribed in section 148, such cred
itor may recover on the bond of the executor or administrator the
amount of his claim, or such part thereof as he would have been enti
tled to had it been allowed. This section shall not apply to any cred
itor whose claim was not due ten months before the day of settlement,
or whose claim was contingent and did not become absolute ten months
before such date.
Sec. 281. If the whole of the debts have been paid by the first dis
tribution, the court must direct the payment of legacies and the distri
bution of the estate among the heirs, legatees, or other persons entitled,
as provided in the next chapter ; but if there be debts remaining unEaid.
or if, for other reasons, the estate be not in a proper condition to
e closed, the court must give such extension of time as may be reason
able for a final settlement of the estate.
Sec. 282. At the time designated in the last section, or sooner, if
within that time all the property of the estate has been sold, or there
are sufficient funds in his hands for the payment of all the debts due
by the estate, and the estate be in a proper condition to be closed, the
executor or administrator must render a final account and pray a set
tlement of his administration.
Sec. 283. If he neglects to render his account, the same proceedings
may be had as provided in this chapter in regard to the first account to
be rendered by him, and all the provisions of this chapter relative to
the last mentioned account, and the notice and settlement thereof, ap
ply to his account presented for final settlement.

legatee, may present his petition to the court for the legacy or share of
the estate to which he is entitled, to be given to him on his giving bonds,
with security, for the payment of his proportion of the debts of the
estate.
Sec. 286. Notice of the application must be given to the executor or
administrator, personally, and to all persons interested in the estate,
in the same manner that notice is required to be given of the settle
ment of the account of an executor or administrator.
Sec. 286. The exacutor or administrator, or any person interested
in the estate, may appear at the time named and resist the applica
tion, or any other heir, devisee, or legatee may make a similar appli
cation for himself.
Sec. 287. If. at the hearing, it appears that the estate is but little
indebted, and that the share of the party applying may be allowed to
him without loss to the creditors of the estate, the court must make an
order in conformity with the prayer of the applicant, requiring :
First. Each heir, legatee, or devisee obtaining such order, before
receiving his share or any portion thereof, to execute and deliver, to
the executor or administrator a bond in such sum as shall be desig
nated by the probate judge, with sureties to be approved by the judge,
payable to the executor or administrator, and conditioned for the pay
ment, whenever required, of his proportion of the debts due from the
estate, not exceeding the value or amount of the legacy or portion of
the estate to which he is entitled.
Second. The executor or administrator to deliver to the heir, legatee,
or devisee, the whole portion of the estate to which he may be entitled,
or only a part thereof, designating it. If, in the execution of the order,
a partition is necessary between two or more of the parties interested,
it must be made in the manner hereinafter prescribed.
The costs of these proceedings to be paid by the applicant, or, if there
be more than one, to be apportioned equally amongst them.
Sec. 288. When any bond has been executed and delivered under
the provisions of the preceding section, and it is necessary for the set
tlement of the estate to require the payment, of any part of the money
thereby secured, the executor or administrator must petition the court
for an order requiring the payment, and have a citation issued and
served on the party bound, requiring him to appear and show cause
why the order should not be made. At the hearing, the court, if satis
fied of the necessity of such payment, must make an order accord
ingly, designating the amount and giving a time within which it must
be paid. If the money is not paid within the time allowed, an action
may be maintained by the executor or administrator on the bond.
ARTICLE II.
DISTRIBUTION ON FINAL SETTLEMENT.
Sec. 289. When estate distributed and of the expenses of closing.
See. 290. What to contain and effect of decree.
Sec. 291. Proceedings ichen decedent was a non-resident and left a
will.
Sec. 292. Decree made on petition; jurisdiction in partition.
Sec. 298. Payment of taxes a condition precedent to distribution.
Sec. 289. Upon the final settlement of the accounts of the executor
or administrator, or at any subsequent time, upon the application of
the executor or administrator, or of any heir, legatee, or devisee, the
court must proceed to distribute the residue of the estate, if any, in the
hands of the executor or administrator, among the persons who by law
are entitled thereto ; and if the decedent has left a surviving child, and
the issue of other children, and any of them, before the close of admin
istration, have died while under age and not having been married, no
administration on such deceased child's estate is necessary, but all the
estate which such deceased child was entitled to by inheritance must,
without administration, be distributed to the other heirs at law. A
statement of any receipts and disbursements of the executor or admin
istrator, since the rendition of his final accounts, must be reported and
filed at the time of making such distribution, and a settlement thereof,
together with an estimate of the expenses of closing the estate, must
be made by the court and included in the order or decree ; or, the
court or judge may order notice of the settlement of such supple
mentary account, and refer the same as in other cases of the settle
ment of accounts.
Sec. 290. In the order or decree the court must name the persons
and the proportions or parts to which each shall be entitled, and such
persons may demand, sue for, and recover their respective shares from
the executor or administrator, or any person having the same in pos
session. Such order or decree is conclusive as to the rights of heirs.
legatees, or devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, or modified
on appeal.
Sec. 291. Upon application for distribution, after final settlement
of the accounts of administration, if the decedent was a non-resident of
this Territory, leaving a will which has been duly proved or allowed in
the State or Territory of his residence, and an authenticated copy
thereof has been admitted to probate in this Territory, and it is neces
sary, in order that the estate or airy part thereof may be distributed
according to the will, that the estate in this Territory should be deliv
ered to the executor or administrator in the State or place of his resi
dence, the court may order such delivery to be made, and, if necessary,
order a sale of the real estate, and a like delivery of the proceeds. The
delivery, in accordance with the order of the court, is a full discharge
of the executor or administrator with the will annexed, in this Terri
tory, in relation to all property embraced in such order, which, unless
reversed on appeal, binds and concludes all parties in interest. Sales
of real estate ordered by virtue of this section must be made in the
same manner as other sales of real estate of decedents by order of the
probate court.
Sec. 292. The order or decree may be made on the petition of the
executor or administrator, or of any person interested in the estate.
Notice of the application must be given by posting or publication, as
the court may direct, and for such time as may be ordered. If parti
tion be applied for, as provided in this chapter, the decree of distribu
tion shall not divest the court of jurisdiction to order partition, unless
the estate is finally closed.
Sec. 293. Before any decree of distribution of an estate is made,
the probate court must be satisfied, by the oath of the executor or
administrator or otherwise, that all territorial, county, and municipal
taxes legally levied upon the personal property of the estate, have been
fully paid.
AETICLE III.
DISTRIBUTION AND PARTITION.
Sec. 294. Appointment of commissioners to make partition .
Sec. 295. Petition for partition and notice thereof.
Sec. 29(5. Partition of estate situated in several counties.
Sec. 297. When heirs have conveyed their shares.
Sec. 298. When shares set out by metes and bounds.
Sec. 299. Partition when real estate can not be divided without injury.
Sec. 800. Payments to equalize partition.
Sec. 801. Sate of estate when it can not be fairly divided.
Sec. 302. Notice of partition and power of commissioners.
Sec. 303. Report of commissioners; decree on same, and record thereof.
Sec. 804. Partition not necessary unless requested.
Sec. 805. Advancements made to heirs.
Sec. 294. When the estate, real or personal, assigned by the decree
of distribution, to two or more heirs, devisees, or legatees, is in com
mon and undivided, and the respective shares are not separated and
distinguished, partition or distribution may be made by three disinter
ested persons, to be appointed commissioners for that purpose by the
probate court or judge, who must be duly sworn to the faithful dis
charge of their duties. A certified copy of the order of their appoint
ment, and of the order or decree assigning and distributing the estate,
must be issued to them as their warrant, and their oath must be
indorsed thereon. Upon consent of the parties, or when the court
deems it proper and just, it is sufficient to appoint one commissioner
only, who has the same authority and is governed by the same rules as
if three were appointed.
Sec. 295. Such partition may be ordered and had in the probate
court, on the petition of any person interested. But before com
missioners are appointed, or partition ordered by the probate court as
directed in this chapter, notice thereof must be given to all persons
interested, who reside in this Territory, or to their guardians, and to the
agents, attorneys, or guardians, if any, in this Territory, of such as
reside out of the Territory, either personally or by public notice, as the
probate court may direct. The petition may be filed, attorneys, guar
dians, and agents appointed, and notice given, at any time before the
order or decree of distribution, but the commissioners must not be
appointed until the order or decree is made distributing the estate.
Sec. 296. If the real estate is in different counties, the probate
court may, if deemed proper, appoint a commissioner for all, or dif
ferent commissioners for each county. The estate in each county must
be divided separately among the heirs, devisees, or legatees, as if there
was no other estate to be divided, but the commissioner first appointed
must, unless otherwise directed by the probate court, mak^ division of
such real estate, wherever situated within this Territory.
Sec. 297. Partition or distribution of the real estate may be made as
provided in this chapter, although some of the original heirs, legatees,
or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such
shares must be assigned to the person holding the same in the same
manner as they otherwise would have been to such heirs, legatees, or
devisees.
Sec. 298. When both distribution and partition are made, the
several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out to each
individual in proportion to his right by metes and bounds, or descrip
tion, so that the same can be easily distinguished, unless two or more
of the parties interested consent to have their shares set out so as to
be held by them in common and undivided.
Sec. 299. When the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice
or inconvenience to the owners, the probate court may assign the
whole to one or more of the parties entitled to share therein who will
accept it, always preferring the males to the females, and, among
children, preferring the elder to the younger. The parties accepting
the whole must pay to other parties interested their just proportion of
the true value thereof, or secure the same to their satisfaction, or. in
case of the minority of such party, then to the satisfaction of his
guardian ; and the true value of the estate must be ascertained and
reported by commissioners appointed to make partition. If the com
missioners are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be divided
without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, they must so report
to the court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as herein pro
vided, and must find and report the true value of such real estate. On
filing the report of the commissioners, and on making or securing the
payment as before provided for, the court, if it appears just and
proper, must confirm the report, and thereupon the assignment is com
plete, and the title to the whole of such real estate vests in the person
to whom the same is so assigned.
Sec. yOO. When any tract of land or tenement is of greater value
than any one's share in the estate to be divided, and cannot be divided
without injury to the same, it may be set off by the commissioners
appointed to make partition, to any of the parties who will accept it,
giving preference as prescribed in the preceding section. The party
accepting must pay or secure to the others such sums as the commis
sioners shall award to make the partition equal, and the commissioners
must make their award accordingly ; but such partition must not be
established by the court until the sums awarded are paid to the parties
entitled to the same, or secured to their satisfaction.
Sec. 301. When it appears to the court, from the commissioners'
report, that it can not otherwise be fairly divided, and should be sold,
the court may order the sale of the whole or any part of the estate,
real or personal, by the executor or administrator, or by a commis
sioner appointed for that purpose, and the proceeds distributed. The
sale must be conducted, reported and confirmed, in the same manner
and under the same requirements provided in Article IV, Chapter VII,
of this Title.
Sec. 302. Before any partition is made, or any estate divided, as
provided in this chapter, notice must be given to all persons interested
in the partition, their guardians, agents, or attorneys, by the com
missioners, of the time and place when and where they shall proceed
to make partition. The commissioners may take testimony, order
surveys, and take such other steps as may be necessary to enable them
to form a judgment upon the matters before them.
Sec. 303. The commissioners must report their proceedings, and
the partition agreed upon by them, to the probate court, in writing,
and the court may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the report, and
commit the same to the same commissioners, or appoint others ; and
when such report is finally confirmed, a certified copy of the judgment
or decree of partition made thereon, attested by the clerk, under the
seal of the court, must be recorded in the office of the recorder of the
county where the lands lie.
Sec. 304. When the probate court makes a judgment or decree,
assigning the residue of any estate to one or more persons entitled to
the same, it is not necessary to appoint commissioners to make par
tition or distribution thereof, unless the parties to whom the assign
ment is decreed, or some of them, request that such partition be made.
Sec. 305. All questions as to the advancements made, or alleged to
have been made, by the decedent to his heirs, may be heard and deter
mined by the probate court, and must be specified in the decree
assigning and distributing the estate ; and the final judgment or
decree of the probate court, or, in case of appeal, of the supreme
court, is binding on all parties interested in the estate.
Sec. 806. When any estate is assigned or distributed by a judgment
or decree of the court, as provided in this chapter, to any person
residing out of and having no agent in this Territory, and it is neces
sary that some person should be authorized to take possession and
charge of the same for the benefit of such absent person, the court
may appoint an agent for that purpose, and authorize him to take
charge of such estate, as well as to act for such absent person in the
distribution.
Sec. 307. The agent must first give a bond to the probate judge, to
be approved by him, conditioned that he shall faithfully manage and
account for the estate. The court appointing such agent may allow
a reasonable sum out of the profits of the estate for his services and
expenses.
Sec. 308. When personal property remains in the hands of the
agent unclaimed for a year, and it appears to the court that it is for
the benefit of those interested, it shall be sold under the order of the
court, and the proceeds, after deducting the expenses of the side
allowed by the court, must be paid into the Territorial treasury. When
the payment is made the agent must take from the treasury duplicate
receipts, one of which he must file in the office of the Territorial
auditor, and the other in the probate court.
Sec. 309. The agent must render to the probate court appointing
him, annually, an account showing :
First. The value and character of the property received by him,
what portion thereof is still on hand, what sold, and for what.
Second. The income derived therefrom.
Third. The taxes and assessments imposed thereon, for what, and
whether paid or unpaid.
Fourth. Expenses incurred in the care, protection and management
thereof, whether paid or unpaid, when filed.
The probate court may examine witnesses and take proofs in regard
to the account, and, if satisfied from such accounts and proofs that it
will be for the benefit and advantages of the persons interested therein,
the court may, by order, direct a sale to be made of the whole or such
parts of the real or personal property as shall appear to be proper,
and the purchase money to be deposited in the Territorial treasury.
Sec. 810. The agent is liable on his bond for the care and preserva
tion of the estate while in his hands, and for the payment of the
proceeds of the sale as required in the preceding sections, and may be
sued thereon by any person interested.
Sec. 311. When any person appears and claims the money paid
into the treasury, the probate court making the distribution must
inquire into such claim, and, being first satisfied of his right thereto,
must grant him a certificate to that effect, under its seal ; and upon the
presentation of the certificate to him, the Territorial auditor must draw
his warrant on the treasurer for the amount.
Sec. 312. When the estate has been fully administered, and it is
shown by the executor or administrator, by the production of satisfac
tory vouchers, that he has paid all sums of money due from him, and
delivered up under the order of the court, all the property of the estate
to the parties entitled, and performed all the acts lawfully required of
him, the court must make a judgment or decree, discharging him from
all liability to be incurred thereafter.
Sec. 313. The final settlement of an estate, as in this chapter pro
vided, shall not prevent a subsequent issue of letters testamentary, or
of administration, or of administration with the will annexed, if other
property of the estate be discovered, or if it become necessary or
proper, for any cause, that letters should be again issued.

minors or non-residents, are unrepresented. The order must specify
the names of the parties for whom the attorney is appointed, who is
thereby authorized to represent such parties in all such proceedings
had subsequent to his appointment. The attorney may receive a fee,
to be fixed by the court, for his sendees, which must be paid out of the
funds of the estate as necessary expenses of administration, and, upon
distribution, may be charged to the party represented by the attorney.

guardian of his estate residing in this Territory, personal service upon

guardian to attend to the interests of the ward in the matter. Such
guardian may also appear for his ward, and waive any procees, notice,
or order to show cause which an adult or a person of sound mind
might do.

sioned, and qualified, must take charge of the estates of persons dying

recovered by the administrator or any party interested.

court, and examine him on oath touching the matter of such com
plaint.
Sec. 341. All such interrogations and answers must be reduced to

the county jail, there to remain in close custody until he submits to the
order of the court.
Sec. 342. The probate court may, at any time, order the public ad

the county.
Sec. 344. It is the duty of every public administrator, as soon as
he shall receive the same, to deposit with the county treasurer of the
county in which the probate proceedings are pending, all moneys of the
estate not required for the current expenses of the administration ; and
such moneys may be drawn upon the order of the executor or adminis
trator, countersigned by the probate judge, when required for the pur
poses of administration. It shall be the duty of the county treasurer to
receive and safely keep all such moneys and pay them out upon the or
der of the executor or administrator, when countersigned by the probate
judge, and not otherwise, and to keep an account with each estate of
all moneys received and paid to him ; and the county treasurer shall be

the estate. After a final settlement of the affairs of any estate, if there
be no heirs or other claimants thereof, the county treasurer shall pay

and effects escheat to the Territory, they must be disposed of as other
escheated estates.

expenditures of any kind made on account of any estate he adminis

the foregoing sections, that any money remains in the hands of the
public administrator (after final settlement of the estate), unclaimed,
which should be paid over to the Territorial treasurer, the probate
judge must order the same to be paid over to the Territorial treasurer,
and, on failure of the public administrator to comply with the order

and acting in the manner provided for regulating the settlement of
the estate of decedents ; such inventory, with the appraisement of
the property therein described, must be recorded by the clerk of the
probate court in a proper book kept in his office for that purpose.
Whenever any property of the estate of any ward is discovered, not
included in the inventory of the estate already returned, and whenever

guardian a verified petition therefor, setting forth the condition of the
estate of his ward, and the facts and circumstances on which the peti

Sec. 381. If it appear to the court or judge, from the petition, that
it is necessary or would be beneficial to the ward that the real estate,
or some part of it, should be sold, or that the real and personal estate

ing the next of kin of the ward, and all persons interested in the estate,

next of kin of the ward, and all persons interested in the estate, at least
fourteen days before the hearing of the petition, or must be published

the court that either the petition or the objection thereto is sustained,
the court may, in granting or refusing the order, award costs to the
party prevailing, and enforce the payment thereof.
Sec. 886. If, after a full examination, it appears necessary, or for
the benefit of the ward, that his real estate, or some part thereof, should
be sold, the court may grant an order therefor, specifying therein the
causes or reasons why the sale is necessary or beneficial, and may, if
the same has been prayed for in the petition, order such sale to be
made, either at public or private sale.
Sec. 387. Every guardian, authorized to sell real estate must, before
the sale, give bond to the probate judge, with sufficient surety, to be
approved by him, with conditions to sell the same in the manner, and

Sec. 390. All sales of real estate of wards must be for cash, or for

ing date from date of sale, as in the discretion of the probate judge is
most beneficial to the ward. Guardians making sales must demand
and receive from the purchasers bond and mortgage on the real estate
sold, with such additional security as the judge deems necessary, and
sufficient to secure the faithful payment of the deferred payments and
the interest thereon.
Sec. 391. The probate court, on the application of a guardian or
any person interested in the estate of any ward, after such notice to
persons interested therein as the probate judge shall direct, may
authorize and require the guardian to invest the proceeds of sales, and
any other of his ward's money in his hands, in real estate or in any
other manner most to the interest of all concerned therein ; and the
probate court may make such other orders, and give such directions as
are needful for the management, investment, and disposition of the
estate and effects as circumstances require.
Sec. 892. When a person liable to be put under guardianship,
according to the provisions of this chapter, resides without this Terri

ested in his estate, in expectancy or otherwise, may apply to the
probate judge of any county in which there is any estate of such absent
person, for the appointment of a guardian ; and if, after notice given to
all interested, in such manner as the judge orders, and a full hearing
and examination, it appears proper, a guardian for such absent person
may be appointed.
Sec. 898. Every guardian appointed under the preceding section has
the same powers and performs the same duties with respect to the
estate of the ward found within this Territory, and with respect to the
person of the ward, if he shall have come to reside therein, as are pre
scribed with respect to any other guardian appointed under this chapter.
Sec. 394. Every guardian must give bond to the ward in the man
ner and with the like conditions as hereinbefore provided for other
guardians, except that the provisions respecting the inventory, the dis
posal of the estate and effects, and the account to be rendered by the
guardian, must be confined to such estate and effects as come to his
hands in this Territory.
Sec. 395. The guardianship which is first lawfully granted of any
person residing out of this Territory, extends to all the estate of the
ward within the same, and excludes the jurisdiction of the probate
court of every other county.
Sec. 896. When the guardian and ward are both non-residents, and
the ward is entitled to property in this Territory which may be removed
to another State or Territory or foreign country, without conflict with
any restriction or limitation thereupon, or impairing the right of the
ward thereto, such property may be removed to the State or Territory
or foreign country of the residence of the ward, upon the application of
the guardian to the probate judge of the county in which the estate of
the ward, or the principal part thereof, is situated.
Sec. 397. The application must be made upon ten days notice to
the resident executor, administrator, or guardian, if there be such, and,
upon such application, the non-resident guardian must produce and file
a certificate, under the hand of the clerk, and seal of the court from
which his appointment was derived, showing :
First. A transcript of the record of his appointment.
Second. That he has entered upon the discharge of his duties.
Third. That he is entitled, by the laws of the State or Territory of
his appointment, to the possession of the estate of his ward ; or, must
produce and file a certificate, under the hand and seal of the clerk of
the court having jurisdiction in the country of his residence of the
estates of persons under guardianship, or of the highest court of such
country, that, by the laws of such country, the applicant is entitled to
the custody of the estate of his ward without the appointment of any
court.
Upon such application, unless good cause to the contrary is shown,
the probate judge must make an order granting to such guardian leave
to take and remove the property of his ward to the State or place of
his residence, which is authority to him to sue for and receive the same
in his own name, for the use and benefit of his ward.
Sec. 398. Such order is a discharge of the executor, administrator,
local guardian, or other person in whose possession the property may
be at the time the order is made, on filing with the probate court the
receipt therefor, of the guardian of such absent ward.

conditional, may be denied probate, according to the event, with refer
ence to the conditions.

gift, void by the preceding section, is made, would have been entitled
to any share of the estate of the testator, in case the will should not

such will, if they think proper.

such revocation or alteration, and executed with the same formalities
-with which a will should be executed by such testator ; or,

tor himself, or by some person in his presence, and by his direction.

remains effectual so far as consistent with the provisions of the subse
quent will.
Sec. 457. If, after making a will, the testator duly makes and
executes a second will, the destruction, cancellation or revocation of
such second will does not revive the first will, unless it appears by the
terms of such revocation that it was the intention to revive and give
effect to the first will, or, unless, after such destruction, cancellation or
revocation, the first will is duly republished.
Sec. 458. If, after having made a will, the testator marries and has
issue of such marriage, born either in his lifetime or after his death,
and the wife or issue survives him, the will is revoked, unless provi
sions have been made for such issue by some settlement, or, unless such
issue is provided for in the will, or in such way mentioned therein as
to show an intention not to make such provision ; and no other evi
dence to rebut the presumption of such revocation can be received.
Sec. 459. If, after making a will, the testator marries, and the wife
survives the testator, the will is revoked, unless provision has been

her subsequent marriage, and is not revived by the death of her hus- .
band.

tator's successors, if the same had passed by succession.
Sec. 462. A charge of incumbrance upon any estate for the purpose
or securing payment of money, or the performance of any covenant or
agreement, is not a revocation of any will relating to the same estate
which was previously executed; but the devise and legacies therein
contained must pass, subject to such charge or incumbrance.
Sec. 468. A conveyance, settlement, or other act of a testator by
which his interest in a thing previously disposed of by his will is altered,
but not wholly divested, is not a revocation ; but the will passes the prop
erty which would otherwise devolve by succession.
Sec. 464. If the instrument by which an alteration is made of the
testator's interest in a thing previously disposed of by his will, expresses
his intent that it shall be a revocation, or if it contains provisions
wholly inconsistent with the terms and nature of the testamentary dis
position, it operates as a revocation thereof, unless such inconsistent
provisions depend on a condition or contingency by reason of which
they do not take effect.
Sec. 465. The revocation of a bill revokes all its codicils.
Sec. 466. Whenever a testator has a child born after the making of
his will, either in his lifetime or after his death, and dies leaving such
child unprovided for by any settlement, and neither provided for, nor
in any way mentioned in his will, the child succeeds to the same portion
of the testator's real and personal property that he would have suc
ceeded to if the testator had died intestate.
Sec. 467. When a testator omits to provide in his will for any of his
children, or for the issue of any deceased child, unless it appears that
such omission was intentional, such child, or the issue of such child.
must have the same share in the estate of the testator as if he had died
intestate, and succeeds thereto as provided in the preceding section.
Sec. 4G8. When any share of the estate of the testator is assigned
to a child born after the making of a will, or to a child or to the issue
of a child omitted in the will, as hereinbefore mentioned, the same must
first be taken from the estate not disposed of by the will, if any ; if that
is not sufficient, so much as may be necessary must be taken from all
the devisees or legatees in proportion to the value they may respect
ively receive under the will, unless the obvious intention of the testator
in relation to some specific devise or bequest, or other provision in the
will would thereby be defeated ; in such case such specific devise, legacy,
or provision may be exempted from such apportionment, and a different
apportionment, consistent with the intention of the testator, may be
adopted.
Sec. 469. If such children, or their descendants, so unprovided for,
had an equal proportion of the testator's estate bestowed on them in
the testator's lifetime by way of advancement, they take nothing in vir
tue of the provisions of the three preceding sections.
Sec. 470. When any estate is devised to any child or other relation
of the testator, and the devisee dies before the testator, leaving lineal
descendants, such descendants take the estate so given by the will, in
the same manner as the devisee would have done had he survived the
testator.
Sec. 471. Every devise of land in any will conveys all the estate of
the devisor therein, which he could lawfully devise, unless it clearly
appears by the will that he intended to convey a less estate.
Sec. 472. Any estate, right, or interest in lands acquired by the tes
tator after the making of his will, passes thereby, and in like manner
as if title thereto was vested in him at the time of making the will, un
less the contrary manifestly appears by the will to have been the inten
tion of the testator. Every will made in express terms devising, or in
any other terms denoting the intent of the testator to devise all the real
estate of such testator, passes all the real estate which such testator
was entitled to devise at the time of his decease.
Sec. 473. No estate, real or personal, shall be bequeathed or devised
to any charitable or benevolent society or corporation, or to any per
son or persons in trust for charitable uses, except the same be done by
will, duly executed at least thirty days before the decease of the testa
tor ; and if so made, at least thirty days prior to such death, such de
vise or legacy, and each of them, shall be valid : Provided, That no
such devises or bequests shall collectively exceed one-third of the estate
of the testator, leaving legal heirs, and in such case a pro rata deduc
tion from such devises or bequests shall be made so as to reduce
the aggregate thereof to one-third of such estate ; and all dispositions
of property made contrary hereto shall be void, and go to the residuary
legatee or devisee, next of kin, or heirs, according to law.
Sec. 474. A will is to be construed according to the intention of the
testator. When his intentions can not have effect to its full extent, it
must have effect as far as possible.
Sec. 475. In case of uncertainty arising upon the face of a will as
to the application of any of its provisions, the testator's intention is to
be ascertained from the words of the will, taking into view the circum
stances under which it was made, exclusive of his oral declarations.
Sec. 476. In interpreting a will, subject to the law of this Territory,
the rules prescribed by the following sections of this chapter are to be
observed, unless an intention to the contrary clearly appears.
Sec. 477. Several testamentary instruments, executed by the same
testatator, are to be taken and construed together as one instrument.
Sec. 478. All the parts of a will are to be construed in relation to
each other, and so as, if possible, to form one consistant whole ; but
where several parts are absolutely irreconcilable the latter must pre
vail.
Sec. 479. A clear and distinct devise or bequest can not be affected
by any reasons assigned therefor, or by any other words not equally
clear and distinct, or by inference or argument from other parts of the
will, or by an inaccurate recital of, or reference to, its contents in
another part of the will.
Sec. 480. Where the meaning of any part of a will is ambiguous or
doubtful, it may be explained by any reference thereto, or recital
thereof, in another part of the will.
Sec. 481. The words of a will are to be taken in their ordinary and
gramatical sense, unless a clear intention to use them in another sense
can be collected, and that other can be ascertained.
Sec. 482. The words of a will are to receive an interpretation which
will give to every expression some effect, rather than one which will
render any of the expressions inoperative.
Sec. 483. Of two modes of interpreting a will, that is to be pre
ferred which will prevent a total intestacy.
Sec. 484. Technical words in a will are to be taken in their technical
sense, unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intention.
Sec. 485." Technical words are not necessary to give effect to any
species of disposition by a will.
Sec. 486. The term "heirs," or other words of inheritance, are not
requisite to devise a fee, and a devise of real property passes all the
estate of the testator, unless otherwise limited.
Sec. 487. Real or personal property embraced in a power to divise,
passes by a will purporting to devise all the real or personal property
of the testator.
Sec. 488. A devise or bequest of all the testator's real or personal
property, in express terms or in any other terms denoting his intent to
dispose of all his real or personal property, passes all the real or per
sonal property which he was entitled to dispose of by will at the time
of his death.
Sec. 489. A devise of residue of the testator's real property passes
all the real property which he was entitled to devise at the time of his
death, not otherwise effectually devised by his will.
Sec. 490. A bequest of the residue of the testator's personal prop
erty passes all the personal property which he was entitled to bequeath
at the time of his death, not otherwise effectually bequeathed by his
will.
Sec. 491. A testamentary disposition to "heirs," relatives, nearest
relations, "representatives," legal representatives, or personal repre
sentatives, or family, issue, descendants, nearest or next of kin, of any
person without other words of qualification, and when the terms are
used as words of donation and not of limitation, vests the property in
those who would be entitled to succeed to the property of such persons
according to the provisions of the Title on successions in this code.
Sec. 492. The terms mentioned in the last section are used as words
of donation and not of limitation, when the property is given to the
person so designated, directly, and not as a qualification of an estate
given to the ancestor of such person.
Sec. 493. Words in a will referring to death or survivorship simply
relate to the time of the testator's death, unless possession is actually
postponed, when they must be referred to the time of possession.
Sec. 494. A testamentary disposition to a class includes every per
son answering the description at the testator's death ; but when the
possession is postponed to a future period it includes also all persons
coming within the description before the time to which possession is
postponed.
Sec. 495. When a will directs the conversion of real property into
money, such property and all its proceeds must be deemed personal
property from the time of the testator's death.
Sec. 496. A child conceived before but not bom until after a testa
tor's death, or any other period when a disposition to a class vests in
right or possession, takes, if answering to the description of the class.
Sec. 497. When applying a will it is found that there is an imper
fect description, or that no person or property exactly answers the
description, mistakes and omissions must be corrected, if the error ap
pears from the context of the will, or from extrinsic evidence ; but evi
dence of the declarations of a testator as to his intentions can not be
received.
Sec. 498. Testamentary dispositions, including devises and bequests
to a person on attaining majority, are presumed to vest at the testa
tor's death.
Sec. 499. A testamentary disposition when vested, can not be
divested unless upon the occurrence of the precise contingency pre
scribed by the testator for that purpose.
Sec. 500. If a devisee or legatee dies during the lifetime of the tes
tator, the testamentary disposition to him fails, unless an intention ap
pears to substitute some other in his place, except as provided in sec
tion 501.
Sec. 501. The death of a devisee or legatee of a limited interest,
before the testator's death, does not defeat the interests of persons in
remainder, who survive the testator.
Se^. 502. A conditional disposition is one which depends upon the
occurrence of some uncertain event by which it is either to take effect
or be defeated.
Sec. 503. A condition precedent in a will is one which is required to
be fulfilled before a particular disposition takes effect.
Sec. 504. When a testamentary disposition is made upon a con
dition precedent, nothing vests until the condition is fulfilled, except
when such fulfillment is impossible, in which case the disposition vests,
unless the condition was the sole motive thereof, and the impossibility
was unknown to the testator, or arose from an unavoidable event sub
sequent to the execution of the will.
Sec. 505. A condition precedent in a will is to be deemed performed
when the testator's intention has been substantially, though not liter
ally, complied with.
Sec. 506. A condition subsequent is when an estate or interest is so
given as to vest immediately, subject only to be divested by some sub
sequent act or event.
Sec. 507. A devise or legacy given to more than one person vests in
them as owners in common.
Sec. 508. Advancements or gifts are not to be taken as redemptions
of general legacies, unless such intention is expressed by the testator,
in writing.
Sec. 509. Legacies are distinguished and designated according to
their nature, as follows :
First. A legacy of a specific thing, specified and distinguished from
all others of the same kind belonging to the testator, is specific ; if such
legacy fails, resort can not be had to the other property of the testator.
Second. A legacy is demonstrative when the particular fund or per
sonal property is pointed out from which it is to be taken or paid ; if
such fund or property fails, in whole or in part, resort may be had to
the general assets, as in case of a general legacy.
Third. An annuity is a bequest of certain specific sums periodically ;
if the fund or property out of which they are payable fails, resort may
be had to the general assets, as in a case of general legacy.
Fourth. A residuary legacy embraces only that which remains after
all the bequests of the will are discharged.
Fifth. All other legacies are general legacies.

erty, in good faith, and for value, derived from any person claiming

Sec. 528. When it appears by the terms of a will that it was the
intention of the testator to commit the execution thereof, and the ad
ministration of his estate to any person as executor, such person,

limited by marriage contract, dies without disposing of the estate by
will, it is succeeded to and must be distributed, unless otherwise
expressly provided in this code and the Code of Civil Procedure, subject
to the payment of his debts, in the following manner :
First. If the decedent leave a surviving husband or wife, and only
one child, or the lawful issue of one child, in equal shares to the sur
viving husband, or wife and child, or issue of such child. If the dece
dent leave a surviving husband or wife and more than one child living,
or one child living, and the lawful issue of one or more deceased
children, one-third to the husband or wife, and the remainder in equal
shares to his children, and to the lawful issue of any deceased child,
by right of his representation ; but if there be no child of the decedent
living at his death, the remainder goes to all his lineal descendants ;
and if all of "the descendants are in the same degree of kindred to the
decedent, they share equally, otherwise they take according to the right
of representation. If the decedent leave no surviving husband or wife,
but leave issue, the whole estate goes to such issue ; and if such issue
consists of more than one child living, or one child living, and the law
ful issue of one or more deceased children, then the estate goes in
equal shares to the children living, or to the child living, and to the
issue of the deceased child or children by right of representation.
Second. If the decedent leave no issue, then the estate goes in equal
shares to the surviving husband or wife, and to the decedent's father.
If there be no father, then one-half goes in equal shares to the brothers
and sisters of the decedent, and to the children of any deceased brother
or sister, by right of representation. If he leave a mother also, she
takes an equal share with the brothers and sisters. If the decedent
leave no issue, nor husband nor wife, the estate must go to the father.
Third. If there be no issue, nor husband, nor wife, nor father, then
in equal shares to the brothers and sisters of the decedent, and to the
children of any deceased brother or sister, by right of representation.
If a mother survive, she takes an equal share with the brothers and
sisters.
Fourth. If the decedent leave no issue, nor husband, nor wife, nor
father, and no brother nor sister is living at the time of his death, the
estate goes to his mother, to the exclusion of the issue, if any, of
â– deceased brothers or sisters.
Fifth. If the decedent leave a surviving husband or wife, and no
issue, and no father, nor mother, nor brother, nor sister, the whole
goes to the surviving husband or wife.
Sixth. If the decedent leave no issue, nor husband nor wife, and no
father, nor mother, nor brother, nor sister, the estate must go to the
next of kin, in equal degree, excepting that when there are two or
more collateral kindred in equal degree, but claiming through different
ancestors, those who claimed through the nearest ancestors must be
preferred to those claiming through an ancestor more remote ; how
ever,
Seventh. If the decedent leave several children, or one child and
the issue of one or more children, and any such surviving child dies
under age, and not having been married, all the estate that came to the
deceased child by inheritance from such decedent descends in equal
shares to the other children of the same parent, and to the issue of any
such other children who are dead, by right of representation.
Eighth. If, at the death of such child who dies under age, not
having been married, all the other children of his parents are also
dead, and any of them have left issue, the estate that came to such
child by inheritance from his parent, descends to the issue of all other
children of the same parent; and if all the issue are in the same
degree of kindred to the child, they share the estate equally, otherwise
they take according to the right of representation.
Sec. 535. If the decedent leave no husband, wife or kindred, the
estate escheats to the Territory.
Sec. 5.6. Every illegitimate child is an heir of the person who, in
writing signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledges
himself to be the father of such child ; and in all cases is an heir of
his mother, and inherits his or her estate, in whole or in part, as the
case may be, in the same manner as if it had been born in lawful wed
lock ; but he does not represent his father or mother by inheriting any
part of the estate of his or her kindred, either lineal or collateral,
unless, before his death, his parents shall have intermarried, and his
father, after such marriage, acknowledges him as his child, or adopts
him into his family, in which case such child and all the legitimate
children are considered brothers and sisters, and on the death of either
of them, intestate and without issue, the others inherit his estate, and
an heir, as hereinbefore provided, in like manner as if all the children
had been legitimate ;Â«saving to the father and mother respectively, their
rights in the estates of all the children in like manner as if all had
been legitimate. The issue of all marriages null in law, or dissolved
by divorce, are legitimate.
Sec. 587. If an illegitimate child who has not been acknowledged
or adopted by his father, dies intestate without lawful issue, his estate
goes to his mother, or, in case of her decease, to her heirs at law.
Sec. 538. The degree of kindred is established by the number of
generations, and each generation is called a degree.
Sec. 589. The series of degrees forms the line; the series of
degrees between persons who descend from one another, is called direct
or lineal consanguinity ; and the series of degrees between persons who
do not descend from one another, but spring from a common ancester,
is called the collateral line, or collateral consanguinity.
Sec. 540. The direct line is divided into a direct line descending,
and a direct line ascending. The first is that which connects the
ancestor with those who descend from him ; the second is that which
connects a person with those from whom he descends.
Sec. 541. In the direct line there are as many degrees as there are
fenerations. Thus, the son is with regard to the father in the first
egree ; the grandson in the second ; and vice versa with regard to the
father and grandfather, towards the sons and grandsons.
Sec. 542. In the collateral line the degrees are counted by genera
tions, from one of the relations up to the common ancestor, and from
the common ancestor to the other relations. On such computation the
decedent is excluded, the relation included, and the ancestor counted
but once. Thus, brothers are related in the second degree ; uncle and
nephew in the third degree ; cousins-german in the fourth, and so on.
Sec. 548. Kindred' of the half-blood inherit equally with those of
the whole blood in the same degree, unless the inheritance came to the
intestate by descent, devise, or gift of some one of his ancestors, in
which case all those who are not of the blood of such ancestor must be
excluded from such inheritance.
Sec. 544. Any estate, real or personal, given by the decedent in his
lifetime as an advancement to any child or other lineal descendant, is
a part of the estate of the decedent for the purposes of division and
distribution thereof among his issue, and must be taken by such child
or other lineal descendant towards his share of the estate of the
decedent.
Sec. 545. If the amount of such advancements exceeds the share
of the heir receiving the same, he must be excluded from receiving any
further portion in the division and distribution of the estate, but he
must not be required to refund any part of such advancement ; and if
the amount so received is less than his share, he is entitled to so much
more as will give him his full share of the estate of the decedent.
Sec. 545. All gifts and grants are made as advancements, if
expressed in the gift or grant to be made, or if charged in writing by
the decedent as an advancement, or acknowledged in writing as such
by the child, or other successor or heir.
Sec. 547. If the value of the estate so advanced is expressed in the
conveyance, or in the charge thereof, made by the decedent, or in the
acknowledgment of the party receiving it, it muSt be held as of that
value, in the division and distribution of the estate, otherwise it must
be estimated according to its value when given, as nearly as the same
can be ascertained.
Sec. 548. If any child or other lineal descendant, receiving advance
ment, dies before the decedent, leaving issue, the advancement must be
taken into consideration in the division and distribution of the estate,
and the amount thereof must be allowed accordingly by the repre
sentatives of the heirs receiving the advancement, in like manner as
if the advancements had been made directly to them.
Sec. 549. The provisions of the preceding section of this Title as to
the inheritance of the husband and wife from each other, apply only to
the separate property of the decedent.
Sec. 550. Upon the death of the wife the entire community property,
without administration, belongs to the surviving husband, except such
portion thereof as may have been set apart to her by judicial decree for
her support and maintenance, which portion is subject to her testa
mentary disposition ; and in the absence of such disposition goes to
her descendants or heirs, exclusive of her husband.
Sec. 551. Upon the death of the husband one-half of the com
munity property goes to the surviving wife, and the other half is sub
ject to the testamentary disposition of the husband ; and in the absence
of such disposition goes to his descendants, equally, if such descend
ants are in the same degree of kindred to the decedent, otherwise,
according to the right of representation ; and in the absence of both
such disposition and such descendants, is subject to distribution in the
same manner as the separate property of the husband. In case of the
dissolution of the community by the death of the husband, the entire
community property is equally subject to his debts, the family allow
ance, and the charges and expenses of administration.
Sec. 552. Inheritance or succession "by right of representation"
takes place when the descendants of any deceased take the same show,
or right, in the estate of another person that their parents would have
taken if living. Posthumous children are considered as living at the
death of their parents.
Sec. 553. Resident aliens may take in all cases by succession as
citizens ; and no person capable of succeeding under the provisions of
this Title is precluded from such succession by reason of the alienage
of any relative ; but no non-resident foreigner can take by succession,
unless he appears and claims such succession within five years after
the death of the decedent to whom he claims succession.
Sec. 554. When succession is not claimed as provided in the pre
ceding section, the district court, on information, must direct the dis
trict attorney of the district in which the property is situated to reduce
the property to his or the possession of the Territory, or to cause the
same to be sold, and the same or the proceeds thereof to be deposited
in the Territorial treasury for the benefit of such non-resident foreigner
or his legal representatives, to be paid to him whenever, within five
years after such deposit, proof to the satisfaction of the Territorial
auditor and treasurer is produced that he is entitled to succeed
thereto.
Sec. 555. When so claimed, the evidence and the joint order of the
auditor and treasurer must be filed by the treasurer as his voucher, and
the property delivered, or the proceeds paid to the claimant on filing
his receipt therefor. If no one succeeds to the estate or proceeds, as
herein provided, the property of the decedent devolves and escheats to
the people of the Territory, and is placed by the Territorial treasurer to
the credit of the general fund.
Sec. 556. Real property passing to the Territory under the last section, whether held by the estate or its officers, is subject to the same
charges and trusts to which it would have been subject if it had passed
by succession.
Sec. 557. Those who succeed to the property of a decedent are
liable for his obligations, in the cases and to the extent prescribed by
the laws of this Territory.
Sec. 558. That an act entitled "An act in relation to administra
tors and executors" (general and miscellaneous laws), codified statutes,
save and except sections 298, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, and 299 thereof,
be and the same are hereby repealed : Provided, That the provisions
of said act shall be and remain in force so far as, and shall be applica
ble to, all estates now in course of administration, and upon which let
ters testamentary or administration have issued to the settlement and
winding up of such estates, and the discharge of the executor and
administrator therein, so far as such act may be applicable and pro
vide for ; but in any matter or thing for which said act may contain no
provision the provisions of this act shall be applicable.
Sec. 559. This act shall take effect on the first day of July, A. D.
1877, and the act mentioned in the last preceding section shall con
tinue in force until the date last aforesaid.
Note.â€”The foregoing 559 sections, except where otherwise specially noted, are taken
