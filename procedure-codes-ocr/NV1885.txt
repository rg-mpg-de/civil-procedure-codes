Sec. 3141 Sec. 119. The supreme court may prescribe by rule
the time when and the cases in which the service of affidavits
to be used upon applications for injunctions, and motions to
dissolve injunctions, shall be made ; and may also provide by
rule for the giving of notice before such hearings of the kind of
testimony to be used, and make all needful rules on the subject
of injunctions not in conflict with this or other Acts.
Sec. 3142. Sec 120. If, upon the hearing of an application
for an injunction, or for the dissolution of an injunction, it does r
not satisfactorily appear that there is a sufficient cause for an
injunction, or if it appear that the extent of the injunction is
too great, it shall be refused, dissolved, or modified, as the case
may be, and upon all such applications in actions respecting
mines, the court or Judge hearing the same may, instead of
granting or continuing the injunction, make an order requiring
the party against whom the application is made to give a bond
in an amount fixed by such court or Judge, with sufficient sure
ties, to be approved by such court or Judge, conditioned for the
payment to the plaintiff of all damages which he may sustain
by reason of the use or occupation of the mine, or other acts
complained of, by the party giving the bond, his or its agents,
servants, employes, grantees, or other persons by his or its con
sent pending the litigation, if the plaintiff finally recover ; or
that upon failure to give such bond within the time prescribed
in the order, the injunction shall be granted, or continued, as
the case may be ; or the court or Judge may apppint a receiver
to take charge of the mine, or the proceeds thereof, pending the
litigation.
Sec. 3143. Sec. 121. It shall be good cause, in the discretion D
of the court or Judge, for the dissolution of an injunction that
the plaintiff is doing, or causing, or permitting to be done, some
act pending the litigation which, if continued, will be injurious
to the defendant if he finally recover, or to the property in dis
pute. But the court or Judge hearing a motion to dissolve an
injunction may, instead of granting such motion, direct by
order that the plaintiff give to the parties restrained a bond
conditioned, as provided in section one hundred and twenty, or
upon his failure to do so within the time prescribed in such
order, that the injunction shall be dissolved.
Sec. 3144. Sec. 122. All undertakings and bonds provided
for in this chapter shall be made payable in gold coin of the

CHAPTER 3. —Of issues and the manner of their disposition.
Sec. 3173. Sec. 153. An issue arises when a fact or conclusion
of law is maintained by the one party, and controverted by the
other. Issues are of two kind : First, of law ; and second, of
fact.
Sec. 3176. Sec. 154. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer
to the complaint, or an answer as to some part thereof.
Sec. 3177. Sec. 155. An issue of fact arises: First, upon a
material allegation in the complaint, controverted by the
answer ; and, second, upon new matter in the answer, except
an issue of law is joined therein.
Sec. 31 73. Sec. 156. An issue of law shall be tried by the
court unless it be referred, upon consent, as provided in ehap-tr
ter six of this title.
Sec. 3179. Sec. 157. An issue of fact shall be tried by a jury,
unless a jury trial is waived, or a reference be ordered, as pro-t
Tided in this Act. Where there are issues, both of law and

Sec. 0180. Sec. 158. The Clerk shall enter cases upon the

Sec. 3182. Sec. 1G0. A motion to postpone a trial, on the
ground of the absence of evidence, shall only be made upon
affidavit showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be

adverse party thereupon admit that such evidence would be
given, and that it be considered as actually given on the trial,
or offered and overruled as improper, the trial shall not be
postponed. The party obtaining the postponement of a trial
shall also, if required by the adverse party, consent that the
testimony of any witness of such adverse party who is in attend

the court in which the case is pending, or before such Notary-
Public as the court may indicate, which shall accordingly be
done, and the testimony so taken may be read on the trial with
the same effect, and subject to the same objections, as if the
witnesses were produced. In actions involving the title to
mining claims and quartz ledges', if it be made to appear to the
satisfaction of the court that in order that justice may be done,
and the action fairly tried on its real merits, it is necessary that
further developments should be made, and that the party ap
plying has been guilty of no laches and is acting in good faith,
the court shall grant the postponement of the trial of the action,
giving the party a reasonable time in which to prepare for trial.
And in granting such postponement, the court may, in its
discretion, annex as a condition thereto an order that the party
obtaining such postponement shall not, pending the trial of the
action, remove from the premises in controversy any valuable
quartz rock, earth, or ores , and for any violation of an order so
made, the court or the Judge thereof may punish for contempt,
as in the cases of violation of an order of injunction, and may
also vacate the order of postponement.

CHAPTER 4.— Trial by jury.
ARTICLE I.
Formation of the jury.
Sec. 3183. Sec. 1(11. When the action is called for trial by
" /~" 11 containing the
draw from the box twelve names, and the persons whose names
are drawn shall constitute the jury. If the ballots become ex
hausted before the jury is complete, or if for any cause a juror
or jurors be excused or discharged, a sufficient number of
additional jurors shall be drawn from the jury box and sum
moned as provided by law. The jury shall consist of twelve
persons, unless the parties consent to a less number. The
parties may consent to any number not less than four. Such
consent shall be entered by the Clerk in the minutes of the
trial. If either party to the action shall, prior to its being- set s
for trial, file and serve upon the opposite party an affidavit J
showing that property or money of more than the value of ten
thousand dollars is involved in the controversy, together with
a notice that he will demand a struck juiy for the trial of the
same, the court shall at the time of setting the cause for trial,
if it be satisfied that said amount or more is really involved,
and if the party demanding such struck jury shall deposit a
sufficient amount to pay the expenses of obtaining the same,
make an order that the cause be tried by a special struck jury,
which shall be obtained in the following manner : The Judge
shall proceed forthwith to draw from the jury box a list of one
hundred names of jurors therein contained, which lift shall be
opened to the inspection of either party at all proper times
after being drawn. At a time to be appointed by the court,
not less than twenty-four hours after the completion of such
list, the parties shall be required, in open court, to strike from
such list one name alternately, the plaintiff striking first, till
there shall be but fifty names remaining. Such fifty remaining
jurors shall thereupon be summoned, as provided by law, to
appear in court on the day fixed for the trial. They shall not
be bound to attend unless when summoned they are paid or
tendered their fees for one day's attendance and mileage from
their place of residence, if they demand it When the veirre
is issued for said jurors, either party shall have the right, upoas
payment of his fees, to demand of the Clerk a duplicate of the
venire, and he, or any citizen of the state in his behalf, may
serve the same, which service shall have the same effect as if
made by the Sheriff of the county. If on the day they are
directed to attend, less than thirty jurors are in attendance, or
if any of the jurors in attendance are for good cause or by con
sent of the pai ties excused by the court, so as to reduce the
number below thirty, the court shall thereupon, if either party
demand it, draw from the jury box an additional list of names,
not less than double the number so deficient, who shall be sum
moned as herein provided to attend forthwith or on any day to
which the trial may be adjourned ; and this process shall be
continued till there are at least thirty jurors for the parties to
choose from ; provided, that if any juror disobey the summons
to attend, the court shall, if either party demand it, compel his
attendance by attachment before summoning additional jurors,
unless the court be satisfied that such attendance cannot be
enforced within a reasonable time. When the attendance of
not less than thirty jurors is secured, unless the parties consent
j.Q y^Qgg from a smaller number, said jurors may be sworn and
examined by the parties on their voir dire, and after such exam
ination, the plaintiff first, and then the defendant, shall strike
from the list one juror alternately till the number is reduced to
twelve, or such less number as the parties may consent to, who
shall be sworn to try the case ; provided, that if there be an
uneven number of jurors to be stricken off, the court shall
strike off the last one ; and if at any stage of the proceedings a
party unreasonably delays to strike off a juror in his turn, the
court shall strike for such party so delaying to strike.-— As
amended, Stals. 1875, 04.
Sec. 3184. Sec. 102. As soon as the jury is completed, an oath
or affirmation shall be administered to the jurors, in substance
that they, each of them, will wTell and truly try the matter in
issue between , the plaintiff, and , the defendant,
and a true verdict render according to the evidence. After the
oath or affirmation has been administered and the jury has been
fully impaneled, it shall be the duty of the court to order the
jury into the custody of the Sheriff, or other officer selected by
the court, and the jurors shall not be allowed to separate or
depart from the custody of the Sheriff or other officer until
they have been duly discharged, unless by the consent of the
parties to the action. It shall be the duty of the Sheriff, at the
charge of the parties to the action, to prepare suitable and com
fortable apartments, and prepare food for the jury ponding the
trial.
Sec. 3185. Sec 1C3. Either party may challenge the jurors;
but when there are several parties on either side, they shall

Sec. 3218. Sec. 190. When the application is made for a cause
mentioned in the first, second, third, and fourth subdivisions of
the hist section, it shall be made upon affidavit ; for any other
cause, it shall be made upon a statement prepared as provided
in the next section.
Rhodes v. Williams, 12 Xev. 20.
Sec. 3219- Sec. 197. The party intending to move for a new
trial shall give notice of the same as follows : When the action
has been tried by a jury, within five days after the rendition of
the verdict, and when the action has been tried by the court or
by a referee, within ten days after receiving written notice of
the rendering of the decision of the Judge, or of the filing the
report of the referee. The notice shall designate generally the
grounds upon which the motion will be made. Within five days
after giving such notice the said party shall prepare and file
with the Clerk the affidavit or statement required by the last section. A copy of the affidavit shall on the same day be served
on the adverse party. The party preparing the statement shall
number the pages and lines thereof, and after having filed the
same with the Clerk, and had such filing entered and indorsed,
shall serve the same on the adverse party on the same day, who
may propose amendments thereto, referring to the page and
line of the statement, and shall, within five days after the ser
vice on him of the statement, file his amendment with the Clerk,
and after having such filing entered and indorsed, shall on the
same day serve the same, with the statement, upon the moving
part}", who shall within five days thereafter give written notice
to the adverse party if he declines admitting the amendments,
or they shall be deemed accepted. At any time thereafter either
party may have the statement settled by the Judge or referee
upon two days' notice thereof to the other party. If no affi-
davit or statement be filed within five days after the notice for
a new trial, the right to move for a new trial shall be waived.
When the notice designates, us the ground upon which the motion
will be made, the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the
verdict or other decision, the statement shall specify the particu
lars in which such evidence is alleged to be insufficient. When
the notice designates as the ground of the motion, error in law
occurring at the trial and excepted to by the moving party, the
statement shall specify the particular errors upon which the
party will rely. If no such specifications be made, the state
ment shall be disregarded. The statement shall contain so
much of the evidence or reference thereto as may be necessary
to explain the particular points thus specified, and no more.
When the statement is agreed to, it shall be accompanied with
the certificate, either of the parties themselves in fact or their
attorney, that the same has been agreed upon and is correct.
When settled by the Judge or referee, it shall be accompanied
with his certificate that the same has been allowed by him and
is correct. When no amendments have been filed, the state
ment shall be accompanied with the certificate of the Clerk of
that fact. On the argument, reference may also be made to the
pleadings, depositions, and documentary evidence on file, testi
mony taken and written out by a short-hand reporter authorized

affidavits and counter affidavits, or the statement thus used in
connection with such pleadings, depositions, documentary evi
dence on file, testimony taken by a reporter, and minutes of the
court as are read or referred to on the hearing, shall constitute,
without further statement, the papers to be used on appeal from
the order granting or refusing the new trial. To identify the
affidavits, it shall be sufficient for the Judge or Clerk to indorse
them at the time as having been read or referred on the hearing.
To identify au_y depositions, documentary evidence on file, testi
mony taken by a reporter, or minutes of the court read or
referred to on the hearing, it shall be sufficient that the Judge
designate them as having been read or referred to in his certifi
cate to be for that purpose by him made thereon. The several

or the Judge before whom the cause was tried.

days after the expiration of such credit ; provided, nmerlhelexs,
that if there are other claims outstanding against the property,
no time or credit shall be given upon the lien after the expira
tion of the six months in which proceedings are required to be

the time the work is completed by any agreement to give credit.
Sec. 3816. Sec. 9. Every building or other improvement
mentioned in section one of this Act, constructed upon any lands

ing any interest therein, shall be held to have been constructed

amount due by him to the contractor, or if the owner shall
have settled with the contractor, he shall be entitled to
recover back from the contractor any amount so paid by him,
the said owner, in excess of the contract price, and for which
the contractor was originally the party liable.
Sec. 3818 Sec. 11. In every case in which different liens are
asserted against any property, the court, in the judgment, must
declare the rank of each lien or class of liens, which shall be in

ceeds of the sale of the property must be applied to each lien or
class of liens in the order of its rank.
Sec. 3819. Sec. 12. Any number of persons claiming liens may
join in the same action ; and when separate actions are com

same are about to be applied to the construction, alteration, or
repair of such building, mining claim, or other improvement.
Sec. 3821. Sec. 14. Nothing contained in this chapter shall

maintain a personal action to recover such debt against the per
son liable therefor.

said premises are justly chargeable, as hereinbefore provided,
the court shall cause said premises to be sold in satisfac-s
tion of said liens and costs, including costs of suit ; and any

payment of costs, shall not be sufficient to satisfy the whole
amount of such liens included in the decree of sale, then such
proceeds shall be apportioned according to the right of the sev
eral parties. In case the proceeds of such sale amount to more
than the sum of said liens and the cost of sale, then the re
mainder shall be paid over to the owner of said property ; and
each party whose claim is not satisfied in the manner hereinbe
fore provided for, shall have personal judgment for the residue
against the party legally liable for the same ; provided, such
person has been personally summoned or has appeared in the
