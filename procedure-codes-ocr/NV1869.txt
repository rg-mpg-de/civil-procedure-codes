in cases where the cause of action now survives by law.

SEC. 17. The Court may determine any controversy between par; ties before it, when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of .,
others, or by saving their rights; but when a complete determination of

SEC. 156. An issue of law shall be tried by the Court unless it be

referred, upon consent, as provided in Chapter Six of this Title.
SEC. 157. An issue of fact shall be tried by ajury, unless a jury

and all such payments or tender shall be made in the kind of money
or currency in which the last redemption was made, and in which the
lieu of such.redemption was payable. A person desiring to redeem
may demand of the purchaser, or last redemptioner, or his attorney in
fact, if he be absent from the county, in which the property is situate,
a statement in writing of all his claims and liens against the property to be paid on redemption, specifying each item; and if he fail to

waste forthe person in possession of the property at the time of sale,

have been received by such purchaser or redemptioner, or which said
purchaser or redemptioner may have been entitled to claim or receive,
unless such claim shall be released to the person claiming such
right of redemption, shall be deducted from the amount which said
purchaser or redemptioner would be entitled 'to receive on such redemption.

SEC. 239. If the purchaser of real property sold on eXecution, or
his successor in interest, or a redemptioner be evicted therefrom in
consequence of irregularities‘in the proceedings concerning the sale or
of the reversal or discharge of the judgment, he may recoverthe price

iroperty at Sheriff ’s sale, or his successor in interest, fail to recover
possession in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning
the sale, or because the property sold was not subject to execution and
sale, the Court having jurisdiction thereof shall, on petition of such ‘
party in interest or his attorney, revive the original judgment for the
amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from

an original judgment of the, said Court of that date, and bearing interest as aforesaid, and any other or after acquired property, rents, issues
or profits of the said debtor shall be liable to levy and sale under execution in satisfaction of such debt; provided, that no property of such
debtor bona fide sold upon the dling of such petition, shall be subject
to the lien of such judgment; and, provided further, that notice of the
filing of such petition shall be made by filing a notice thereof in the
ofiice of the Recorder of the county where such property is situated,
