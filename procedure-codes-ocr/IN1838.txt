AN ACT to amend an act entitled an act organizing Circuit Courts, and denning
their powers and duties.
[APPROVED FEBRUARY 15, 1838.]
'Whereas, it often happens that reasons exist to make it a mat
ter of delicacy for a president judge of a circuit to preside
on the triaL of a particular cause, although he may not be le
gally disqualified; and whereas, it is desirable that a presi
dent judge of a circuit should not be subjected to the odi-
• um arising from a resistance of temporary popular excite
ment, which may sometimes become his duty; and whereas,
it is desirable to avoid the transfer of chancery cases to a
neighboring circuit, or to the supreme court, for the cause of
the interest or prejudice of a circuit judge; and w'hereas,
• the president judge is frequently of council for parties in
causes which afterwards come up for trial before him; and
whereas, >it is proper that a general system of practice should
prevail in the circuit courts throughout the state, which may
be effected by the means pointed out herein; therefore,
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
Indiana, That any president judge of a circuit in this state
s]lan \>e competent to preside in and hold anv circuit court
r ' r » J
within any county ol this state, the president judge of the cir
cuit to which such county may belong being absent; and said
president judge so holding such court may continue the session
thereof, during any entire term, or during the progress of any
one trial or for any less time-.

doubtful solvency of the person or persons owing the same, or
on account of some legal or equitable defence which such per
son or persons may allege' against the same, or for the cause
of the smallness of such claim, debt, or demand, and the dif
ficulty of finding the debtors, owing to the remoteness of their
residence, or to such executor's or administrator's ignorance of

[shall discover] that the real and personal property of any decedent
which is or may be made assets in his hands, to be ad
ministered according to law, will not pay and satisfy the debts
and demands outstanding against the estate entrusted to his ad
ministration, he shall forthwith proceed to make such real es-

and according to the provisions of this act, if the same shall
not have been previously done, or by prosecuting such pro

office of the clerk thereof in vacation, his complaint stating
clearly and succinctly the condition of such estate, both real

debts and demands outstanding against such estate, so far as
the same may have come to his knowledge, and that such es

court or judge aforesaid. And from the date of the filing of
the said complaint, no suit or action shall be brought or sus-
tained, against such executor or administrator, unless waste or
negligence or fraud in the discharge of the duties of his trust,
as such, be alleged against such executor or administrator; and1
if any such suit or action be brought after the filing of suclr
complaint, the plaintiff, complainant or claimant alleging such
^rau^' negligence, or waste, and such plaintiff, complainant or
claimant shall fail, upon the trial thereof, to establish such

hearing of the said demands, the court shall allow or disallow
the same, in whole or in part, as to him may seem just and
right, either party having a right to demand a trial by jury, if

and the residue of the proceeds thereof shall constitute a part
of the fund above directed to be paid into court, for distributionamong
the creditors aforesaid; and if the estate bound by such
lien, be insufficient to satisfy the same, the creditor in whose
favor such lien may have been created or suffered, shall, as to
the residue of his claim, be left unsatisfied, after having ex
hausted the estate bound thereby, stand on an equal footing
with the general mass of the creditors of the said estate; and by

the court, to the appellee, for the due prosecution of the ap
peal; and the penalty of the said bond shall be in a reasonable
sum, in the discretion of the court.
Sec 17. ,In all appeals and writs of error, the transcript of
the record, shall be transmitted by the plaintiff in error, or ap-
to the c1erk of tne supreme court' within sixty days
at most, from the time of taking such appeal, or suing out such
writ of eiror, and shall not be thereafter received, unless for
good cause shewn, further time be giyen by the court; and it
shall be the duty of the clerk of the supreme court, whenever
any appellant shall fail to file his appeal, agreeably to the requi
sitions of this section, to make out and deliver to the appellee,
a certificate of such failure, which certificate, when presented
to the clerk of the court below, shall be sufficient authority for
execution and other proceedings in the case, as if no ap-
peal had been granted. The appellee or defendant in error,
may demand a trial at the term to which the appeal or writ of
error is made returnable, and the court shall not continue the
eame to another term, without the. consent of the appellee or •
defendant in error, unless upon good and sufficient cause. No
pleadings shall be required on writs of error, except an assi
ment of errors, to be filed by the plaintiff, on or before the fi
day of the term, to which the writ of error is returnable, and
an answer thereto, by the defendant, to be made at such time
as the court shall direct; but the cause shall stand for trial, at
the term to which the writ may be returned.
SEC. 18. No writ of error shall operate as a supersedeas,
unless the supreme court, or some judge thereof, [in vacati
after inspecting the errors which shall be assigned upon the
transcript of the record, shall order the same to be made a su
persedeas; and in such ease, the clerk issuing the said writ,
shall endorse thereon, that it shall be a supersedeas, and shall
be obeyed accordingly. No writ of supersedeas, granted by
the supreme court of this state, restraining any of fie circ
courts from proceeding to the execution of any judgment here...
after by them rendered, shall be of any force, after four years
from and after the time of granting such writ: Provided, the
supreme court shall not, during that time, have affirmed or re-
versed such judgment. Upon application of the party int
ested, to the clerk of the supreme court, he shall certify under
his hand and the seal of said court, the time of the expiration
of said writs of supersedeas, which certificate, shall be evi
dence of the same; and when presented to the circuit court,
shall be sufficient authority for said court to proceed to execu- 2
tion of said judgment; and it shall not be lawful for the su-
preme court, or any judge thereof, to award a second writ of
supersedeas, to stay proceedings on any judgment, after the
expiration of the limited time by this act, for the operation of a
writ of supersedeas. . . - - -
SEc. 19. Before any writ of error shall operate as a supersedeas,
it shall be necessary, that a bond, to be approved by
the clerk of the supreme court, be given, in like manner, and with
the same conditions, and under the same penalties, as is provided
in case af appeals; or that bond be given in like manner, in the
office of the clerk of the court below, subject to such regula
tions and conditions, as the supreme court or any judge thereof
may prescribe and direct. Writs of error shall be issued as a
matter of right, on demand of any person applying for the
same, and the clerk of the supreme court, at the time of issu-s
ing a writ of error, shall issue a summons, directed to the she
riff of the county in which such defendant in error shall reside,
requiring him to summon said defendant, to appear on the first.
day of the next term of the said court, to answer such error or
errors. And if the summons shall appear, by the return of
the sheriff or other officer, to have been served ten days before
the return day thereof, the same shall stand for trial, agreeably
to the provisions of the eleventh [seventeenth] section of this
act. If the summons shall be returned not executed,—or if by
any satisfactory proof, it shall appear to the court, that such
defendant or defendants, is or are not an inhabitant or inha
tants of this state, the said court may order, that notice of the
pendency of such writ of error, be published in some one of
*
public newspapers; for three weeks successively; after whicb
same shall be jproceeded upon, in all respects, as if process
had been returned executed.
Sec. 20. When the plaintiff in error shall obtain a tran-
of the record, from the clerk of the inferior court, certiby
such clerk, as being a full and complete transcript of
,ecoru m lne su[t or aclion named, and sealed with the ju
seal of said court, it shall be lawful for such plaintiff, to
assign upon the said transcript, all the errors upon which he
intends to rely, in order to reverse the said judgment or decree,
and file the same with the clerk of the supreme court, who
shall receive the same and endorse upon it when filed; and in
such case it shall not be necessary for said clerk to issue a writ
of error to the court below, but he shall issue a summons to
the defendant or defendants in error, in the same manner, as if
a writ of error had issued, and the supreme court shall proceed
in all respects to determine the same accordingly. ' -
Sec. 21. The plaintiff,-except in cases of wills, shall assign
erroiS upon matters of law only, arising upon the face of
^ proceedings. In cases of wills, the plaintiff in error may
assign errors upon matters of fact, as well as upon matters of
law, to be determined by the court. If the judgment or decree
ke an<;rmej jn tne whole, the appellant shall pay to the appel
lee, a sum not exceeding ten per centum, at the discretion of the
eeurt on the sum due thereby, besides the costs on the original
suit and appeal. If the judgment or decree be reversed in the
whole, the appellee shall pay to the appellant such costs as the
court in their discretion shall award. If the judgment or de
cree Joe reversed in part, and affirmed in part, the costs of the
original suit and appeal, may be apportioned between the ap-
pellant and appellee, in the discretion of the court. In case of
partial reversal, the supreme court shall give such judgment
or decree, as the inferior court ought to have given. On appeals
and writs of error, it shall .be lawful for the supreme court
l0 issue execution, or remand the cause to their inferior court,
■ j .i . - i 'l .u . .l
in order that an execution may be there issued or that other
proceedings may be had thereon. When any judgment or de-
cree shall be reversed on account of any error, which shall or
may nave laken place in the progress of the cause, in the court
below, the supreme court shall not reverse the proceedings any
further than to include the first error which shall have been
committed; and the cause shall be remanded to the court from
whence it came, together with the opinion of the supreme
. , ... •..•*. .i_ •" <• • .
court, and with instructions to the inferior court, to commence
from the last regular-proceedings had thereon, and proceed to
trial and judgment, in the same manner as if no proceedings
had been had in the supreme court, taking the opinion of thesupreme
court as their guide: and in such cases, the party ha
ving committed the first error, shall pay to the opposite party,
such costs as the court shall order. When any Writ of error
shall have been made a supersedeas, and the judgment or de
cree so superseded, shall be affirmed in part or in whole, the
defendant in- error shall be entitled to the same damages, which
are allowed by this act, in case of appeals. If a decree in equi- c
ty be reversed, the supreme court may either render such a de
cree as the inferior court ought to have given, or may remand
the cause to the inferior court for further proceedings consistent
with the opinion of the supreme court.
Sec. 22. No writ of error shall^be brought after the expi- L
ration of five years, from the rendition of the judgment or decree
complained of; unless the plaintiff in error, shall have been, at
the time when such judgment or decree was made, an infant,
feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned, or out of the
limits of the United States on public business, in which case,'
the five years shall be computed from the time when such dis
ability ceased. • . -. , v .
Sec. 23. No judgment, after the verdict of twelve men,
shall he stayed or reversed, where it shall appear to the court,
that the merits of the case have been fairly and fully decided
by such verdict, and that such verdict and the judgment there-
on, might be effectually pleaded in bar to another action
brought for the same cause. But nothing herein contained
shall be construed to extend to, or cure any errors in the judg
ment of the court, in questions of law, which may have been
brought up before the court, by the pleadings, or otherwise, if
they appear upon the record. Whenever, on hearing an ap.peal
or writ-of error, the supreme court shall be equally divi-
ded in opinion, the suit shall be continued until the next term,
and if then the. court are still divided, the judgment or decree
of the inferior court shall be affirmed.
Sec. 24, The clerk of the supreme court, shall carefully
preserve the transcripts of records certified to his court, with
the bonds for prosecution, .and all papers relative.tb them, and
other cases pending in said court, docketing truem, in the order
in which he may receive them, that they may be heard in the
same order, unless the Court for good catose- to tfiem s}ie wn, may
direct any tote heard out -of his turn.' The proceedings of
every day during a term, shall be drawn up.at full lenth, by the
clerk against the next sitting of the court, and such corrections
as may be necessary, being first made therein, shall be signed
by the presiding judge. When any cause shall be finally de
termined, the clerk shall- make a complete record thereof, not
including the transcript from.the court below. All writs and
summonses, issuing' from the supreme court, shall bear test, in
the name of the clerk, who issues the same, and shall be da
ted when issued. - . .
Sec. 25. The supreme court shall have power to impose
and administer all necessary oaths and affirmations, to punish by
fine and imprisonment, all contempts of authority in any cause
on examination before them, and lo establish all necessary
rules for that purpose, or any other, in conformity to the laws
and constitution of this state, not otherwise provided for by
law. . • *
Sec 26. Witnesses shall be summoned in the same man-
ner, have the same privileges, and be subject to the same penjilties,
which are or may be prescribed by law, respecting those
summoned to attend the circuit courts. Juiors may be sum
moned whenever required, in such manner as the court shall
direct, and shall be liable to the same fines and penalties,
which -are or may be inflicted by law on those summoned to,
and attending on the circuit courts.
Sec. 27. For good cause shewn, the supreme court, or any
judge thereof in vacation, may grant commissions for the
examination of witnesses; and the clerk of the said court,
where any witness shall be about to depart from thestate, or
shall by age, sickness, or otherwise, be unable to attend to the
court, or when jhe claim or defence of any party, or a materi
al part thereof, shall depend on a single witness, mayr on affi
davit made and filed, issue a commission for taking the deposition
of such person de bene esse, to be read at the trial, in
case the witness shall be out of thejurisdiction of the court, or
unable to attend. But the party obtaining &uch commission,
shall give reasonable notice to the opposite party, of the time
and place of taking such depositions.
Sec. 28. In the supreme court, the parties may manage
'heir own causes personally, or by their attorneys properly au
thorized for that purpose, or by such attorneys at law, as by
the rules of said court, may be permitted to manage causes
therein. Non-resident plaintiffs in error and appellants shall
