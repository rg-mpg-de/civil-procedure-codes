Section 4910. The "Code of Practice in Civil Cases " shall regulate the
procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in all the courts of this state,
though not expressly enumerated, and of all that may hereafter be created ; and
all laws coming within the purview of its provisions shall be repealed (a).
Civil Code, sees. 796 and 780.
(a) But as to justices' courts, see Secs. 4034, 4035. And see Secs. 6363, 5021.
SEC. 4911.
First.
Remedies in civil cases are divided into two classes:
Actions.
Second.
Special proceedings.
SEC. 4912. A civil action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice
by one party against another for the enforcement or protection of a private
right, or the redress or prevention of a private wrong. It may also be brought
for the recovery of a penalty or forfeiture.
SEC. 4913. Every other remedy in a civil case is a special proceeding
Civil Code, secs. 2-4, Preliminary Provisions.
SEC. 4914. The forms of all actions and suits heretofore existing are abol:
ished.
SEC. 4915.
There shall be but one form of action for the enforcement or protection of private rights, and the redress or prevention of private wrongs,
which shall be called a civil action.
SEC. 4916. In such action the party complaining shall be known as the
plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant.
SEC. 4917. The proceedings in a civil action may be of two kinds:
First.
Second.
At law.
In equity.
SEC. 4918. The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable proceedings
in all cases where courts of chancery, before the adoption of this code, had
jurisdiction, and must so proceed in all cases where such jurisdiction was ex
clusive.
SEC. 4919.
In all other cases the plaintiff must prosecute his action by proceedings at law.
SEc. 4920. An action upon a written obligation or judgment which has
been lost or destroyed may be prosecuted by proceedings at law. Civil Cod,
secs. 1–6.
SEC. 4921. No action to obtain a discovery shall be brought except as provided in the next section.
SEC. 4922. Where any person or corporation is liable, either jointly or se"erally with others, by the same contract, an action may be brought against any
of the parties who are liable to obtain discovery of the names and residences of
the others who are also liable.
SEc. 4923. In such action the plaintiff shall state in his complaint, in effect
that he has used due diligence, without success, to obtain the information asked
to be discovered, and that he does not believe the parties to the contract who are known to him have property sufficient to satisfy his claims. The co"
plaint shall be verified, and the cost of such action shall be paid by
the plaintiff, unless the discovery be resisted. Ib, sec. 788.
SEC. 4924. The writ of ne exeat as a remedy in a civil action is abolished.
Ib., sec. 790.
Sec. 4925. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceedings adopted
shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of the action, but merely a change
into the proper proceedings by an amendment in the pleadings and a transfer
of the action to the proper docket (aa).
SEC. 4926. The error mentioned in the last section may be corrected by the
plaintiff without motion at any time before the defendant has answered, or
afterward, on motion in court.
Sec. 4927. Such error is waived by failure to move for its correction at the
time and in the manner prescribed in this chapter, and all errors in the decis
ions of the court on any of the motions named in this chapter are waived un
less excepted to at the time, which may be done by the clerk noting at the end
of such decision words of the following import : " To which decision the plaintiff
(or defendant) excepts" (b).
Sec. 4928. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correction made in
the following cases :
First. When the action has been commenced by equitable proceedings the
defendant, by motion made at the time of riling his answer, may have them
changed into proceedings at law when it appears that, by the provisions of sec
tion 4919, the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings at law, unless his an
swer presents an equitable defense.
Second. When the action has been commenced by proceedings at law the
defendant, by motion made at or before the time of filing his answer, may have
them changed into equitable proceedings when it appears that, by the provis
ions of section 4918, the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings in equity.
SEC. 4929. Where the action has been properly commenced by proceedings
at law, either party shall have the right, by motion, to have any issue which
heretofore was exclusively cognizable in chancery tried in the manner herein
after prescribed in cases of equitable proceedings (*) ; and if all the issues are
such as heretofore were cognizable in chancery, though none were exclusively
so, the defendant shall have the right to have them all tried as in cases of pro
ceedings in equity.
SEC. 4930. If the plaintiff's claim is for money due by contract, and the
defendant puts in a defense of exclusively equitable cognizance, upon the
plaintiff filing an affidavit that he verily believes that he will succeed in
the action, and that the collection of his claim after judgment will be endan
gered by the delay arising from such defense being put in, the court shall
require the defendant to give security for the payment of any judgment that
(aa) See Sec. 4928.
Where there is an equitable issue in a suit at law, and there is no motion to transfer, the Issue must be
disposed of according to the principles involved. Trulock v. Taylor, 26—54.
Purely equitable relief can not be granted in a suit properly brought at law. Little Sock Railroad Co. v.
Perry, 37—185.
Objection that suit should have been brought at law can not be raised by demurrer. Ib. Equitable relief
can not be granted on an application for mandamus unless the pleading Is reformed and the cause transferred.
Crawford v. Carton, 35—565. The court Is not bound to make the transfer unless asked. Berry v. Hardin, 28—458.
And if no motion is made the objection is waived. Mow v. Adams, 32—562 ; Talbot v. WUkim, 31—411. A mere
transfer to the equity side does not make the cause one of equitable relief. Roberte v. Jacks, 31—598. When
an equitable answer asks relief the cause should be transferred. Ivey v. Drake, 36—228.
(b) For time and manner of taking exceptions, see 8ecs. 5157-5161.
An error in sustaining a demurrer to part of an answer is not waived because not excepted to on the record.
Cotlim v. Karatopsky, 36—323.
(*) See Sec. 5106.
the plaintiff may obtain in the action, and, upon his failure to give such secu.
rity, shall order the defendant to pay into court an amount sufficient to dis.
charge the plaintiff's claim and his probable costs; upon which order execution
may be issued as upon a judgment, and the amount collected upon execution
shall be brought into court and await the decision of the action, and be paid
to the plaintiff or defendant, according to such decision. But no security shall
be required if the trial of the equitable defense takes place during the term at
which it is put in, nor until all defenses to the action, other than those of
equitable cognizance, are tried or disposed of in favor of the plaintiff.
SEC. 4931. The provisions of this chapter concerning the prosecution of a
civil action apply to both kinds of proceedings, unless the contrary appears.
SEC. 4932. A judgment obtained in an action by proceedings at law shall
not be annulled or modified by any order in any action by equitable proceed.
ings, except for a defense which has arisen or been discovered since the judg:
ment was rendered; but such judgment does not prevent the recovery of any
claim, though such claim might have been used as a defense by way of set-off
or counter claim in the action on which the judgment was recovered (c). Ib,
secs. 7–14.
SEC. 4933.
Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as provided in sections 4935, 4936 and 4938 (d).

tuted in the action, proper orders being made as to security for the costs.
SEC. 4936. An executor, administrator, guardian, trustee of an express trust, a person with whom, or in whose name, a contract is made for the benefit
of another, or the state, or any officer thereof, or any person expressly authorized by the statute to do so, may bring an action without joining with him the
person for whose benefit it is prosecuted (e). Ib., secs. 25–28.

territories or districts of the United States, under the laws thereof, may sue in any of the courts of this state, in their representative capacity, to the same and

and all actions to enforce the vendor's lien upon any such lands, and all actions
to recover the possession of, or for trespasses upon, any such lands, shall be
brought and prosecuted in the name of the State of Arkansas ; and the fact
that any and all of said lands may have been set apart, or allotted, or granted,
by the state to any county, township or school district shall not be a defense
to any action brought under this section, and shall not affect the jurisdiction
of the court in which the action may be pending, but all questions as to the
rights of such counties, townships or school districts shall be reserved, and
shall not be affected by any proceeding under section 4936.

believe that the party, whose agent or attorney verified such pleading or affi
davit, can truthfully verify the same with his own oath, and that the matters
therein alleged are within the personal knowledge of such party. Upon the
filing of such affidavit it shall be the duty of the court to compel such party to

account, a copy thereof must, in like manner, be filed with the pleading (pp).
lb., sec. 138, as amended 1871.
Sec. 5064. If either party shall rely upon any deed or other writing, he
shall file with his pleading the original deed or writing, if in his power, or a

shall so state in his pleading, together with the reasons therefor; and, if such
reasons are sufficient, he may file the best evidence of the contents of such deed
or writing in his ' power. Original deeds and other writings, filed by either
(pp) Ab to when writing filed with the pleading may be read, see Sec. 287J. A failure to file writing is
no ground of demurrer. Kordman v. Craighead, 27—369; Surginer v. Paddock, 31—529; Henry v. Blackburn,
32—446. The substance of the writing should be Btated in the pleadings, Ib. Where a copy has been filed
the court may still compel the filing of the original. Weaver v. Carnall, 35—203 ; Egan v. Tewketbury, 82—43. In

the party whose pleading contained it.
SEC. 5067. In pleading a judgment or other determination of the court, or
officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the facts con
ferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have
been duly given or made. If such allegation is made in a complaint, and is not
controverted in the answer, or made in the answer in relation to a counter
claim or set-off, and is not controverted in the reply, it need not be proved on
the trial.
SEC. 5068. In pleading the performance of a condition precedent in a con
tract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance, but
it may be stated generally that the party duly performed all the conditions on
his part; and, if such an allegation is not controverted as stated in the last
section in regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary to prove it on trial.
SEC. 5069.
In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the appli
cation to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action
arose; but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or
spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation is not controverted as
stated in section 5067 in regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary to prove
it on trial.
SEC. 5070.
In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory
and any mitigating circumstances, legally admissible in evidence, to reduce the
amount of damages, and, whether he proves the justification or not, he may
give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
SEC. 5071. In an action for the recovery of real property, it must be
described in the complaint with such convenient certainty as to enable an
officer holding an execution to identify it.
SEC. 5072. Every material allegation of the complaint not specifically con
troverted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter in the
answer constituting a counter-claim or set-off not specifically controverted by
the reply, must, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true (£). But the

allegation of new matter in the answer not relating to a counter-claim or set-off.
or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party

as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require. Allegations of
value, or of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true by the failure to
controvert them.

A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim

it insufficient. Ib., sees. 139-147.
Sec. 5074. In actions founded upon a note, bond, bill of exchange, mort
gage or other written obligation of the defendants, or any of them, the plaint

to said action upon the merits, and that if defense is made thereto it will be
made for the purpose of delay merely ; whereupon the court shall not allow an
answer to be filed in said action, or, if filed, shall strike out the same, unless it
be accompanied with an affidavit to the effect that the affiant verily believes
that there is a good and valid defense to said action upon the merits thereof.
Provided, that such affidavit shall not dispense with any verification required in
other cases. And, provided, further, that if such defendant should fail to estab
lish his defense to the merits of said case, the clerk shall tax against him a
docket fee for double the amount allowed in other like actions. Ib., sec. 149.
AMENDMENTS (qq).
Sec. 5075. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof
is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his
prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it
is alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact must be shown to the satis
faction of the court, and it must also be shown in what respect he has been
misled ; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended upon
such terms as may be just.
SEC. 5076. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last sec
tion, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence, and
may order an immediate amendment without costs.
Sec. 5077. Where, however, the allegation of the claim or defense, to which
the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or particulars only,
but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance
within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

material to the case; or, when the amendment does not change subtantially the

may be taken as true.
SEC. 5130. Where the summons in an action by equitable proceedings has

their verdict, unless by order of the court; and he shall not, before their verdict
is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations or the
verdict agreed upon.
SEC. 5134. If the jury are permitted to separate, either during the trial or

sent out for further deliberation.
SEC. 5139. The verdict shall be written, signed by the foreman and read
by the court or clerk to the jury, and the inquiry made whether it is their ver
dict.

is complete and the jury discharged from the case (bbb).
SEC. 5140. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. A general
verdict is that by which they pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues,
either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.
SEC. 5141. A special verdict is that by which the jury finds the facts only.
It must present the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence

Sec. 5147. Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed to authorize
the entry of the judgment against any party who may have died before a ver

both parties, it shall order the action to be stricken from the docket.
