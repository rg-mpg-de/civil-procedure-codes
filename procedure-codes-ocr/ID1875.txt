tainty execute a writ of assistance or possession.
Sec. 59. In pleading a judgment or other determination
of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall

without damages for the withholding thereof ; or,
Fourth, Claims against a trustee by virtue of a contract,
or by operation of law ; or, Fifth. Injuries to character ;
or, Skcth, Injuries to person ; or, Seventh, Injuries to
property. But the causes of action so united shall all be
long to only one of these classes, and shall affect all the

sential to the claim, or defense, and which could not be

an answer at the same time of filing the demurrer; and
when the demurrer to a complaint is overruled, and

original pleadings.

of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of
a party, or a mistake in any other respect, and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for an answer or de
murrer, or demurrer to an answer filed. The court may
likewise, upon affidavit showing eood cause therefor, af

ceeding complained of was taken, the court or the judge
at chambers in vacation may grant the relief upon ap

posited and remaining unapplied.
Sec. 95. If after being arrested, the defendant
escape or be rescued, the sheriff shall himself be liable
as bail ; but he may discharge himself from such liabil
ity by the giving and justification of bail, at any time
before judgment.

the court or judge may order such property to be sold
in the same manner as property is sold under an execu
tion, and the proceeds to be deposited in the court to
abide the judgment in the action. Such order can be
made only upon notice to the adverse party or his attor
ney, in case such party has been personally served with
a .summons in the action.
Sec. 131. If any personal property attached be
claimed by a third person as his property, the sheriff
may .summon a jury of six men to try the validity of

.execution.
Sec. 132. If the judgment be recovered by the
plaintiff, the sheriff shall satisfy the same out of the
property attached by hiin, which has not been delivered
to the defendant, or a claimant as hereinbefore provided,
or subjected to execution on another judgment recov

plaintiff the proceeds of all sales of perishable property
sold by him or of any debts or credits collected by him,
or so much as shall be necessary to satisfy the judgment;
Second, If any balance rejnain due and an execution
shall have been issued on the judgment, he shall sell un
der the execution so much of the property, real or per
sonal, as may be necessary to satisfy the balance, if
enough for that purpose remain in his hands. JS'otices
of the sales shall be given, and the sales conducted as in
other cases of sales on execution.
Sec. 133. If after selling all the property attached
by him remaining in his hands, and applying the pro-
ceeds, together with the proceeds ot any debts or credits
collected by him, deducting his ices, to the payment of

sheriff shall proceed to collect such balance, as upon an
execution in other eases. Whenever the judgment shall

shall deliver over to the defendant the attached property
remaining in his hands, and any proceeds of the property
attached unapplied on the judgment.
Sec. 134. If the execution be returned unsatisfiedj
in whole or in part, the plaintiff may prosecute any un
dertaking given, pursuant to sections one hundred and
twenty-three and one hundred and thirty-seven, or he
may proceed as in other cases upon the return of an exe
cution.
Sec. 135. If the defendant recover judgment against
the plaintiff, any undertaking received in the action, all
the proceeds of sales, and money collected by the sheriff,
and all the property attached remaining in the sheriffs
hands, shall be delivered to the defendant or his agent,
the order of attachment shall be discharged and the
property released therefrom.
Sec. 136. Whenever the defendant shall have ap
peared in the action he may, upon reasonable notice to
the plaintiff, apply to the court in which the action is
pending, or to the judge thereof, or to a probate judge,
for an order to discharge the attachment, in whole or in
part ; and upon the execution of the undertaking men
tioned in the next section, an order may be made releas
ing from the operation of the attachment any or all of
the property attached, and all of the property so released,
and all of the proceeds of the sales thereof, must be de
livered to the defendant, upon the justification of the
sureties on the undertaking, if required by the plaintiff.
Sec. 137. Before the granting of such order the
court, or judge, shall require an undertaking, on behalf
of the defendant, by at least two sureties, residents and
freeholders, or householders, in the county, to the effect
that, in case plaintiff recover judgment in the action,
defendant will, on demand, redeliver such attached
property so released to the proper officer to be applied
to the payment of the judgment, or, in default thereof,
defendant and sureties will, on demand, pay to the plain
tiff the full value of the property released. The court
or judge granting sne-h release may fix the sum for
which the undertading shall be executed, and, if neces
sary in fixing such sum to know the value of the prop
erty released, the same may be appraised by three disin
terested persons, to be appointed for that purpose. The
sureties may be required to justify before the court or
judge, and the property attached shall not be released
from the attachment without their justification, if the
same be required.
Srco. 138. The defendant may also, at any time
before the time for answering expires, apply on motion,
upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff, to the court in
which the action is brought, or to the judge thereof, or
to a probate judge, that the writ of attachment be dis
charged on the ground that the same was improperly or
irregularly issued.
Sec. 139. If the motion be made upon affidavit on
the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plain- o
tiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other evidence
in addition to those on which the attachment was made.

appears that the writ of attachment was improperly or
irregularly issued, it must be discharged.
Sec. 141. The sheriff shall return the writ of attach
ment with the summons, if issued at the same time;
otherwise, within twenty days after its receipt, with a cer

pare and serve upon his adversary and 6ubmit to the
judge such findings, and may, within two days there
after, briefly suggest in writing to the judge why he
desires findings upon the points included within the
findings prepared by himself, or why he objects to find
ings upon the points included within the findings pre
pared by his adversary. The judge may adopt, modify
or reject the findings so submitted. If at the time of
the submission of the cause the judge does not direct the
preparation of findings, or those prepared are rejected,
then he must himself prepare the findings.
Sec. 190, On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an
issue of law, he may proceed in the manner prescribed
by the first two subdivisions of section one hundred and
fifty-six upon the failure of the defendant to answer. If

may be directed to hear and decide the whole issue, or to
report upon any specific question of fact involved there
in ; or when the taking of an account shall be necessary
for the information of the court before the judgment, or
for carrying a judgment or order into effect ; or when a
question of fact other than upon the pleadings shall
arise, upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the
action ; or when it is necessary for the information of
the court in a special proceeding.
Sec. 193. A reference may be ordered to any person
or persons, not exceeding three, agreed upon by the

reside in the county in which the action or proceeding
is triable, and against whom there is no legal objection.
Sec. 194. When the appointment of referees is
made by the judge, each referee shall be—First, quali
fied as a juror as provided by statute; second, compe
tent as a juror between the parties.
Sec. 195. When the referees are chosen by the court,
each party shall have the same right to challenge as to
such referees, to be made and determined in the same
manner and with like effect as in the formation of juries,
except that neither party shall be entitled to a peremp
tory challenge. Subject to the limitations and directions
prescribed in the order of reference, the trial by referees
shall be conducted in the same manner as a trial by the
court. They shall have the same power to grant ad
journments, to administer oaths, to preserve order, and
punish all violations thereof, upon such trial, and to
compel the attendance of witnesses, and to punish them
for non-attendance or refusal to be sworn or to testify, as
is possessed by the court. The objections taken to the

Sec. 197. The finding of the referee upon the whole

ment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if
the action had been tried by the court.
Sec. 198. The findings of the referee may be ex
cepted to and reserved in like manner as is made by the

ing reported has the effect of a special verdict.
Sec. 199. The report shall be filed with the clerk ;
if filed in term time, either party may, within such
time as may be prescribed by the rules of court, or by
special order, move to set the same aside or for judg
ment thereon, or such order or proceeding as the nature
of the case may require. If the report be filed in vaca
tion, the like proceedings may be had at the next term
following. The court may affirm or set aside the report,
either in whole or in part. If it affirm the report, it
shall give judgment accordingly. If the report be set
aside, either in whole or in part, the court may make
another order of reference as to all or to so much of the
report as is set aside to the original referees, or others,
or it may find the facts and determine the law itself, and
give judgment accordingly. Upon a motion to set aside
a report, the conclusion thereof shall be deemed and
considered as the verdict of a jury.

•entry of judgment, ii the action were tried without a
jury, or such further time as the court in which the
action is pending, or a judge thereof, may allow, prepare
the draft of a bill and serve the same, or a copy .thereof,
upon the adverse party. Such draft must contain all the
exceptions taken upon which the party relies. Within
ten days after such service the adverse party may pro
pose amendments thereto, and serve the same, or a copy
thereof, upon the other part}7. The proposed bill and
amendments must, within ten days thereafter, be pre
sented by the party seeking the settlement of the bill to
the judge who tried or heard the case, upon five days'

exceptiou in accordance with the facts, the party desiring
the bill settled may apply by petition to the Supreme
Court to prove the same. The application may be made
in the mode and manner and under such regulations as
that court may prescribe, and the bill, when proven,
must be certified by one of the justices of said court as
correct and filed with the clerk of the court in which the
action was tried, and when so filed, it has the same force
and effect as if settled by the judge who tried the cause.

Sec. 210. When the application is made for a cause
mentioned in the first, second, third and fourth subdivisions

adverse party a notice of his intention, designating the
grounds upon which the motion will be made, and

the moving party must, within ten days after serving
the notice, or such further time as the court in which the
action is pending, or a judge thereof, may allow, file such
affidavits with the clerk and serve a copy upon the adverse

hundred and four. If the action was heard by a ref

ment of the statement by him as are required by that section for the settlement of bills of exception by a
referee. If no amendments are served within the time
designated, or, if served and allowed, the proposed state
ment and amendments, if any, may be presented to thejudge

to 6uch redundant and useless matter, or to any inaccu
rate statement. When settled, the statement shall be
signed by the judge or referee, with his certificate to the
effect that the same is allowed, and shall then be filed
with the clerk.
Fourth—When the motion is to be made upon the
minutes of the court, and the ground of the motion is
the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or
other decision, the notice of motion must specify the par
ticulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insuf
ficient ; and, if the ground of the motion be errors in
law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the

bill of exceptions, or statement, as the case may be, used
on the hearing, with a copy of the order made, shall
constitute the record to be used on appeal from the order
granting or refusing a new trial, unless the motion be
made on the minutes of the court, and in that case the
judgment roll and a statement to be subsequently pre
pared, with a copy of the order, shall constitute the
record on appeal. Such subsequent statement shall be
proposed by the party appealing, or intending to appeal,
within ten days after the entry of the order, or such
further time as the court in which the action is pending,
or a judge thereof, may allow, and the same, or a copy
thereof, be served upon the adverse party, who shall have

sary to explain them ; and it shall be the duty of the
judge to exclude all other evidence or matter from the
statement.
Sec. 213. The verdict of a jury may also be vacated*
and a new trial granted by the court in which the action
is pending, on its own motion, without the application of
either of the parties, when there has been such a plain
disregard by the jury of the instructions of the court, or
the evidence in the case, as to satisfy the court that the
verdict was rendered under a misapprehension of such
instructions, or under the influence of passion or preju
dice. The order of the court may be reviewed on appeal
in the same manner as orders made on motion for a new"
trial, and a statement to be used on such appeal may be

dence, or in any other county of his district.

originals whenever they, or any part thereof, may be
destroyed, lost or mutilated.

it requires the performance of any other act, a certified
copy of the judgment may be served upon the party
against whom the same is rendered or upon the person
or officer required thereby or by law to obey the same.
Obedience thereto may be enforced by the court ; and
after a final judgment of partition, the court shall have
power to enfore a severance of the possession.
Sec. 232. In all cases other than for the recovery of
money the judgment may be enforced or carried into
execution after the lapse of five years from the date of
its entry, by leave of the court, upon motion, or by
judgment for that purpose founded on supplemental
pleadings.

the judgment, execution thereon may be issued, in case
of the death of the plaintiff, the same as if he were
living, upon the application of his executor or adminis

judgment was rendered or exists. And in case of the

from his county six persons, qualified as jurors, between
the parties, to try the validity of the claim. He shall
also give notice of the claim, and of the time of trial, to
the plaintiff, who may appear and contest the claim

the claimant, the sheriff shall relinquish the levy, unless
the judgment creditor give him a sufficient indemnity
for proceeding thereon. The fees of the jury, the sheriff
and the witnesses shall be paid by the claimant, if the

ment debtor be present and indicate at the time of the
levy such part ; and provided, that the property indi
cated be amply sufficient to satisfy such judgment and fees.
Sec. 242. Before the sale of property on execution
notice thereof shall be given as follows :
First—In case of perishable property, by posting
written notices of the time and place of sale in three
public places of the precinct, township or city where the

township or city where the sale is to take place not less
than five nor more than ten days successively.
Third—In case of real property, by posting similar
notices, particularly describing the property, for twenty

paper published in tha county, if there be one.
Fourth—When the judgment under which the prop
erty is sold is made payable in a specified kind of money
or currency, the several notices required by this section
shall 6tate the kind of money or currency in which bids

made between the hours of nine in the morning and five
in the afternoon. After sufficient property has been
sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold.
Neither the officer holding the execution nor his deputy
shall become a purchaser at such sale. When the sale is
of personal property, capable of manual delivery, it shall
be within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold
in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest prices ;
and when the sale is of real property, and consists ©f
several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold sepa
rately; or when a portion of such real property is
claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold
separately, such portion shall be thus sold. The judg
ment debtor, if present at the sale, may also direct the
order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold,
when such property consists of several known lots or
parcels, or of articles which can be sold to advantage
separately ; and the sheriff shall be bound to follow such
directions.
Sec. 245. If a purchaser refuse to pay the amount
bid by him for property struck off to him at a sale under
execution, the officer may again sell the property, at any
time, to the highest bidder; and if any loss be occasioned
thereby, the officer may recover the amount of such loss,
with costs, by motion, upon previous notice of five days
before any court, or before any justice of the peace, if
the same shall not exceed his jurisdiction.
Sec. 246. Such court or justice shall proceed, in a
summary manner, to give judgment and issue execution
therefor forthwith ; but the defendant may claim a jury.
And the same proceeding may be had against any sub
sequent purchaser who may refuse to pay ; and the
officer may, in his discretion, thereafter reject the bid of
any person so refusing. .
Sec. 247. The two preceding sections shall not be
construed to make the officer liable for any more than the
amount bid by the second or subsequent purchasers and
the amount collected from the purchaser refusing to pay.
Sec. 248. When the purchaser of any personal prop

deliver to him a certificate of the sale and payment.
Such certificate 6hall convey to the purchaser all the
right, title and interest which the debtor had in and to
such property on the day the execution was levied.
Sec. 249. When the purchaser of any personal prop
erty not capable of manual delivery shall pay the pur

and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of sale and pay
ment. Such certificate shall convey to the purchaser all
right, title and interest which the debtor had in and to
such property on the day the execution was levied.
Sec. 250. Upon n sale of real property, the purchaser
shall be substituted to, and acquire all the right, title,
interest and claim of the judgment debtor thereto ; and
when the estate is less than a leasehold of two years' un

cases the property shall be subject to redemption, as pro
vided in this chapter. The officer shall give to the purchachaser
a certificate of sale, containing—First, a par
ticular description of the real property sold ; second, the
price bid for each distinct lot or parcel ; third, the whole
price paid ; fourth, when subject to redemption, it shall
be so stated. And when the judgment under which the
sale has been made is made payable in a specified kind
of money or currency, the certificate shall also state the
kind of money or currency in which such redemption
may be made, and which shall be the same as that speci
fied in the judgment. A duplicate of such certificate
shall be filed in the office of the recorder of the county.
Sec. 251. Property sold subject to redemption, as
provided in the last section, or .any part sold separately,
may be redeemed in the manner hereinafter provided,
by the following persons, or their successors in interest :
First. The judgment debtor, or his successor in interest,
in the whole or any part of the property. Second. A
creditor having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the
property sold. The persons mentioned in the second subdivision of this section are in this act termed
" redemptioners."
Sec. 252. The judgment debtor, or a redemptioner,
may redeem the property from the purchaser within six
months after the sale on paying the purchaser the
amount of his purchase, with eighteen per cent, thereon
in addition, together with the amount of any assessments
or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon ;
and if the purchaser be also a creditor, having a lien
prior to that of the redemptioner other than the judg
ment under which the purchase was made, the amount
of such lien, with interest.
Sec. 253. If the property be so redeemed by a re
demptioner, either the judgment debtor or another re
demptioner may, within sixty days after the last redemp
tion, again redeem it from the last redemptioner on
paying the sum paid on such last redemption, with four
per cent, thereon in addition, and the amount of any
assessments or taxes which the said last redemptioner
may have paid thereon after the redemption by him,
with interest on such amount, and the amount of any
liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own,
with interest in addition ; provided, that the judgmens
under which the property was sold need not be paid at
a lien. The property may be again redeemed, and as
often as the debtor or a redemptioner, within sixty days
after the last redemption, pay the amount of the last re
demption, with four per cent, thereon in addition, and
the amount of any assessments or taxes which the said
last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption by
him, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens
other than the judgment under which the property was
sold, held by the said last redemptioner previous to his
own. with interest. Notice of redemption shall be given
to the sheriff. If no redemption be made within six
months after sale, the purchaser or his assignee, sliall be
entitled to a conveyance ; or if so redeemed whenever
sixty days have expired, and no other redemption has
been made, and notice thereof given, the time for re
demption shall have expired, and the last redemptioner,
or his assignee, be entitled to a sheriffs deed. If the
debtor redeem at any time before the time for redemp
tion expires, the effect of the sale shall be terminated,
and he be restored to his estate.
Sec. 254. The payments mentioned in the last two sections may be made to the purchaser or redemptioner,
as the case may be, or for him, to the officer who made
the sale. "When the judgment under which the sale has
been made is payable in a specified kind of money or
currency, said payments shall be made in the same kind
of money or currency, and a tender of the money shall
be equivalent to payment.
Sec. 255. A redemptioner shall produce to the
officer, or person from whom he 6eeks to redeem, and

showing the amount then actually due on the lien.
Sec. 256. Until the expiration of the time allowed
for redemption, the court may restrain the commission
of any waste on the property, by order granted, with or
without notice, on the application of the purchaser or the
judgment creditor. But it shall not be deemed waste

of Bale, or entitled to possession afterward during
the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it
in the same manner in which it was previously used, or
to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry, or to
make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon, or to
use wood or timber on the property therefor, or for the
repair of feiices, or for fuel in his family, while he occu
pies the property.
Sec. 257. The purchaser, from the time of the sale
until a redemption, and a redemptioner, from the time
of his redemption until another redemption, shall be entitled to receive from the tenant in possession the rents,
issues and profits of the property sold, or the value of
the use and occupation thereof ; provided, that in the
case the property shall be redeemed as provided in this
act, the amount of such rents and profits which he may
have been entitled to claim or receive, unless such claim
shall be re-leased to the person claiming such right of
redemption, shall be deducted from the amount which
such purchaser or redemptioner would be entitled to
receive on such redemption.
Sec. 258. If the purchaser of the real property sold
on execution, or his successor in interest, be evicted
therefrom in consequence of irregularity in the proceed
ings concerning the sale or of the removal or discharge
of the judgment, he may recover the price paid, with
interest, from the judgment creditor. If the purchaser
of property at a sheriff's sale, or his successor in interest,
fail to recover possession in consequence of irregularity
in the proceedings concerning the sale, or because the
property sold was not subject to execution and sale, the
court having jurisdiction thereof shall, on petition of such
party in interest, or his attorneys, revive the original judg
ment for the amount paid by such purchaser at the sale,
with interest thereon, from the time of payment, at the
same rate that the original judgment bore; and when so
revived, the said judgment shall have the same effect as
the original judgment of said court, of that date, and
bearing interest as aforesaid ; and any other or after
acquired property, rents, issues or profits of the said
debtor shall be liable to levy and sale under execu
tion in satisfaction of such debt; provided, that no
property of such debtor sold, bona Jlde, before the fifing
of such petition shall be subject to the lien of such judg
ment ; and provided further, that notice of the filing of
such petition shall be made by filing a notice thereof in
the recorder's office of the county where such property
may be situated, and that said judgment shall be revived
in the name of the original plaintiff, or plaintiffs, for the
use of said petitioner, the party in interest. All sales
ordered by the court shall be conducted in" the same
manner as sales upon execution.

filed, is returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the
judgment creditor, at any time after such return is made,
is entitled to an order from the judge of the court, or a
probate judge, requiring such judgment debtor to appear
and answer concerning his property before such judge,
or a referee appointed by him, at a time and place speci
fied in the order; but no judgment debtor must be re
quired to attend before a judge or referee out of the
county in which he resides.
Sec. 260. After the issuing of an execution against
property, and upon proof by affidavit of a party, or other
wise, to the satisfaction of the court, or of a judge
thereof, or a probate judge, that any judgment debtor
has property which he unjustly refuses to apply towards
the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge
may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear
at a specified time and place before such judge, or a
referee appointed by him, to answer concerning the same :
and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the appli
cation of the property of the judgment debtor toward
the satisfaction of the judgment as are provided upon
the return of an execution. Instead of the order requir
ing the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge
may, upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent
or attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the
debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the debtor
and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought
before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into an
undertaking, with sufficient security, that he will attend,
from time to time, before the judge, or referee, as shall
be directed during the pendency of proceedings, and
until the final determination thereof, and will not in the
meantime dispose of any portion of the property not
exempt from execution. In default of entering into such

Sec. 262. After the issuing or return of an execu
tion against property of a judgment debtor, or of any
one of several debtors in the 6ame judgment, or upon
proof by affidavit, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the
judge, that any person or corporation has property of
such judgment debtor, or is indebted to him in an
amount exceeding fifty dollars, the judge may, bv an
order, require such person or corporation, or any officer
or member thereof, to appear, at a specified time and
place, before him, or a referee appointed by him, and
answer concerning the same.
Sec. 263. Witnesses may be required to appear and
testify before the judge, or referee, upon any proceed
ings under this act m the same manner as upon the trial

alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to
be indebted to nim, claims an interest in the property
adverse to him, or denies the debt, the court or judge

judgment creditor to institute a suit against such person
or corporation for the recovery of such interest or debt ;
and the court or judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or
other disposition of such interest or debt until an action
can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment. Such
order may be modified or vacated by a judge granting
the same, or the court in which the action is brought, at
any time, upon such terms as may be just.
'Sec. 266. If any person, party or witness disobey an
order of the referee, properly made, in the proceedings

Sec. 267. There can be but one action for the
recovery of any debt, or the enforcement of any right
secured by mortgage upon real estate or personal prop
erty, which action must be in accordance with the pro
visions of this act. In such action the court may, by its
judgment, direct a sale of the encumbered property, or
so much thereof as may be necessary, and the application
of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the costs
of the court and the expenses of the sale, and the amount
due to the plaintiff ; and if it appear from the sheriffs
return that the proceeds are insufficient, and a balance
still remains due, judgment can then be docketed for
such balance against the defendant or defendants per
sonally for the debt, and it becomes a lien on the real
estate of such judgment debtor, as in other cases on
which execution may be issued. No person holding a
conveyance from or under the mortgagor of the property
mortgaged, or having a lien thereon, which conveyance
or lien does not appear of record in the proper office at
the time of the commencement of the action, need be
made a party to such action ; and the judgment therein
rendered and the proceedings therein had are as conclu
sive against the party holding such unrecorded convey
ance or lien as if he had been made a party to the action.
Sec. 268. If there be surplus money remaining after
payment of the amount due on the mortgage, Men, or
encumbrance, with costs, the court may cause the same
to be paid to the person entitled to it, and in the mean
time may direct it to be deposited in court.
Sec. 269. If the debt for which the mortgage, lien
or encumbrance is held be not all due, so soon as suffi-
cient of the property has been sold to pay the amount
due, with cost, the sale shall cease ; and afterwards, as
often as more becomes due for principal or interest, the
court may, on motion, order more to be sold. But if the
property cannot be sold in portions without injury to the
parties, the whole may be ordered to be sold in the first
instance, and the entire debt and costs paid, there being
a rebate of interest where such rebate is proper.
Actions for Nuisance, Waste and Wilful Trespass
in Certain Cage* on Real Property.
Sec. 270. Anything that is injurious to health, or
indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to
the free use of property, so as to interfere with the com
fortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance and
the subject of an action. Such action may be brought
by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or
whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance ;
and by the judgment the nuisance may be enjoined or
abated, as well as damages recovered.
Sec. 271. If a guardian, tenant for life or years,
joint tenant, or tenant in common of real property, com-
init waste thereon, any person aggrieved by the waste
may bring an action against him therefor, in which
action there may be judgment for treble damages.

person's house, village or city lot, or cultivated grounds,
or on the commons, or public grounds of any city or
town, or on the street or highway in front thereof, with
out lawful authority, shall be liable to the ow»er of such
land, or to such city or town, for treble the amount of
damages which may be assessed therefor in a civil action
in any court having jurisdiction.
Sec. 273. Nothing in the last section shall authorize
the recovery of more than the just value of timber
taken from uncultivated wood land for the repair of the
public highway or bridges upon the land or adjoining it.
Sec. 274. If a person recover damages for a forcible
or unlawful entry in or upon, or detention of, any build
ing, or any cultivated real property, judgment may be
entered for three times the amount at which the actual
damages are assessed.
Actions to Determine Conflicting Claims to Real
Property, and Other Provisions relating to Actions Concern
ing Real EUtate.
Sec. 275. An action may be brought by any person
against another who claims an estate or interest in real
property adverse to him for the purpose of determining
such adverse claim.
Sec. 276. If the defendant in such action disclaim in
his answer any interest or estate in the property, or suffer
judgment to be taken against him without answer, the
plaintiff shall not recover costs.
Sec. 277. In an action for the recovery of real prop
erty, when the plaintiff shows a right to recover at the
time the action was commenced, but it appears that hisright
has terminated during the pendency of the action,
the verdict and judgment shall be according to the fact,
and the plaintiff may recover damages for withholding
the property.
Sec. 278. "WTien damages are claimed for withhold
ing the property recovered, upon which permanent im
provements have been made by a defendant, or those
under whom he claims holding under color of title, ad
versely to the claims of the plaintiff, in good faith, the
value of such improvements shall be allowed as a set-off
against such damages.
Sec. 279. The court in which an action is pending
for the recovery of real property, or for damages for an
injury thereto, may, on motion, upon notice, by either
party, for good cause shown, grant an order allowing
to such party the right to enter upon the property, and
make survey and measurement thereof, and of any tun
nels, shafts or drifts thereon, for the purpose of the
action, even though entry for such purpose has to be
made through other lands belonging to parties to the
action.
Sec. 280. The order shall describe the property, and
a copy thereof shall be served on the owner or occupant ;
and thereupon such party may enter upon the property,
■frith necessary surveyors and assistants, and make such
survey and measurements ; but if any unnecessary injury
be done to the property, he shall be liable therefor.
Sec. 281. A mortgage of real property shall not be
deemed a conveyance, whatever its terms, so as to enable
the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of the
real property without a foreclosure and sale.
Sec. 282. The court may, by injunction, on good
cause shown, restrain the party in possession from doing
any act to the injary of real property during the fore
closure of a mortgage thereon, or after a sale on execu
tion, before a conveyance.
Sec. 283. When real property shall have been sold
on execution, the purchaser thereof, or any person who
may have succeeded to his interest, may, after his estate
becomes absolute, recover damages for injury to the
property by the tenant in possession after sale and before
possession is delivered under the conveyance.
Sec. 284. An action for the recovery of real property
against a person in possession cannot be prejudiced
by an alienation made by such person, either before or
after the commencement of the action.
Sec. 285. In actions respecting mining claims proof
must be admitted of the customs, usages or regulations
established Jand in force at the bar, diggings, or in the
district embracing such claims ; and such customs,
usages and regulations, when not in conflict with the
laws of this Territory, must govern the decision of the
action.
Seo. 286. When several co-tenants hold and are in
possession of real property, parceners, or joint tenants
in common, in which one or more of them have an
estate of inheritance, or for life or lives, or for years, an
action may be brought by one or more such persons for
a partition thereof, according to the respective rights of
the persons interested therein ; and for a sale of such
property, or a part of it, if it appear that a partition
cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners.
Sec. 287. The interests of all persons in the property,
whether such persons be known or unknown, shall be set
forth in the complaint, specifically and particularly, as
far as known to the plaintiff ; and if one or more of the

judgment is rendered, except that, where there are sev
eral unknown persons having an interest in the prop
erty, their rights may be considered together in the
action, and as between themselves.
Seo. 294. Whenever from any cause it is, in the
opinion of the court, impracticable or highly inconve
nient to make a complete partition, in the first instance,
among all the parties in interest, it shall be lawful for
the court to first ascertain and determine the share or
interest respectively held by the original co-tenants, and
thereupon to adjudge and cause a partition to be made
as if such original co-tenants were the parties, and sole
parties in interest, and the only parties to the action, and
thereafter to proceed in like manner to adjudge and
make partition separately of each share, or portion so
ascertained and allotted, as between those claiming under

part or portion thereof, which existed ana were of record
at the time of the commencement of the action, and the
persons holding such liens are not made parties to the
action, the court must either order such persons to be
made parties to the action, by an amendment or supple
mental complaint, or appoint a referee to ascertain
whether or not such liens or encumbrances have been
paid, or, if not paid, what amount remains due thereon,
and their order among the liens or encumbrances sev
erally held by such persons and the parties to the action,

party to the action, to appear before the referee at a
specified time and place, to make proof by his own affi
davit or otherwise of the true amount due, or to become
due, contingently or absolutely, thereon. In case such
person be absent, or bis residence be unknown, service
may be made by publication, or notice to bis agent,
under the direction of the court, in 6uch manner as may
be proper. The report of the referee thereon shall be
made to the court, and shall be confirmed, modified or
set aside, and a new reference ordered, as the justice o£
the case may require.
Sec. 297. If it be alleged in the complaint and estab
lished by evidence, or if it appear by the evidence with
out such allegation in the complaint, to the satisfaction
of the court, that the property, or any part of it, is so
situated tliat partition cannot be made without great prej
udice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof.
Otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it shall
order a partition, according to the respective rights of
the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint ref
erees therefor ; and shall designate the portion to remain
undivided for the owners whose interests remain un
known or are not ascertained.
Sec. 298. In making the partition the referee shall
divide the property and allot the several portions thereof
to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively

employ a surveyor, with the necessary assistants, to aid
therein.
Sec. 299. The referees shall make a report of their
proceedings, specifying therein the manner of executing
their trust, describing the property divided, and the
shares allotted to each party, with a particular descrip

set aside the report, and, if necessary, appoint new ref

on all persons named as parties to the action and their
legal representatives, who have at the time any interest
in the property divided, or any part thereof, as owners
in fee, or as tenants for life, or for years ; or as entitled
to the reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of such
property, or any part thereof, after the termination of a
particular estate therein, and who by any contingency
may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property,
or who have an interest in any undivided share thereof,
as tenants for years or for life ; second, on all persons
interested in the property who may be unknown to whom
notice shall have been given of the action for partition
by publication ; and, third, on all other persons claiming
from such parties or persons, or either of them. And
no judgment is invalidated by reason of the death of any
party before final judgment or decree, but such judg
ment or decree is as conclusive against the heirs, legal
representatives or assigns of such decedent as if it had
been entered before his death.
Sec. 301. But such judgment and partition shall not
affect tenants for years less than ten to the whole of the
property which is the subject of the partition.

different parties to the action equitably.
Sec. 303. When a hen is on an undivided interest or
estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be
made, shall thenceforth be a charge only on the share
assigned to such party; but such share shall be first
charged with its just proportion of the costs of the par
tition in preference to such Hen.
Sec. 304. When a part of the property only is
ordered to be sold, if there be an estate for hie or years
in an undivided share of the whole property, such estate

of the general costs of the action. Second. To pay the

record the several liens, iri their order of priority, by
payment of the sums due and to become due, the amount
due to be verified by affidavit at the time of payment.

Sec. 306. Whenever any party to an action who
holds a lien upon the property, or any part thereof, has
other securities for the payment of the amount of such
lien, the court may, in its discretion, order such securi
ties to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds
of sale, or may order a just deduction to be made from
the amount of the lien on the property, on account
thereof.
Sec. 307. The proceeds of sale and the securities
taken by the referees, or any part thereof, shall be dis
tributed by them to the persons entitled thereto ■when

court, or deposited therein, as directed by the court.
Sec. 308. When the proceeds of sale of any share or
parcel belonging to persons who are parties to the action,
and who are known, are paid into court, the action may
be continued, as between such parties, for the determi

ascertained and adjudged by the court. Further testi
mony may be taken in court, or by a referee, at the dis
cretion of the court, and the court may, if necessary,
require such parties to present the facts or law in con
troversy, by pleadings, as in an original action.

after deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable
sum to be allowed on account of such estate, and shall
order the same to be paid to such party or deposited in
court for him, as the case may require.
Sec. 314. If the person entitled to such estate for
life or years be unknown, the court shall provide for the

motion is made upon the minutes of the court, provided
in section two hundred and twelve, or any bill of excep

or modified, the appellate court may make complete res
titution of all property and rights lost by the erroneous
judgment or order, so far as such restitution is consistent
with protection of a purchaser of property at a sale
ordered by the judgment, or had under process issued
upon the judgment, on the appeal from which the pro
ceedings were not stayed ; and for relief in such cases
the appellant may have his action against the respond
ent, enforcing the judgment for the proceeds of the sale
of the property, after deducting therefrom the expenses
of the sale. When it appears to the appellate court that

* and their Rights and Duties.
Sec. 627. The process by which the attendance of a
witness is required is a subpoena. It is a writ or order
directed to a person and requiring his attendance at a
particular time and place to testify as a witness. It may
also require him to bring with him any books, docu
ments, or other thing under his control which he is
bound by law to produce in evidence. No person shall
be required to attend as a witness before any court,
judge, justice, or any other officer out of the county in
which he resides, unless the distance be less than thirty
miles from his place of residence to the place of trial.
Sec. 628. The subpoena shall be issued as follows :
First—To require attendance before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, it shall be issued in the name
of the court before which the attendance is required or
in which the issue is pending.

judge or justice, or any other officer authorized to ad
minister oaths or take testimony in any matter under the
laws of this Territory, it shall be issued by the judge,
justice or other officer before whom the attendance is
required -
Third—To require attendance before a commissioner
appointed to take testimony by a court of any other State,
Territory or county, it may be issued by any judge or
justice of the peace in places within their respective
jurisdictions, with like power to enforce attendance, and
upon certificate of contumacy to said court to punish
contempt of their process, as such judge or justice could
excercise if the subpoena directed the attendance of the
witness before their courts in a matter pending therein.
Sec. 629. The service of a subpoena shall be made
by reading the same to the witness, or by delivering a
copy thereof to such witness, or by leaving such copy
with some suitable person at the place of his abode,
giving or offering to him at the same time, if demanded
by him, the fees to which he is entitled for travel to and
from the place designated and one day's attendance
there. Such service may be made by any person ; but
when made by tiny other person than an officer author
ized to serve the process, it sliall be proved by the affi
davit of the person making it.
Sec. 630. If a witness be concealed in a building or
vessel, so as to prevent the service of a subpoena upon
him, any court or judge or any officer issuing the sub
poena may, upon proof by affidavit of the concealment,
and of the materiality of the witness, make an order that
the sheriff of the county serve the subpoena, and the
sheriff shall serve it accordingly, and for that purpose
may break into the building or vessel where the witness
is concealed.
Sec. 631. A person present in court, or before a
judicial officer, may be required to testify in the same
manner as if he were in attendance upon a subpoena
issued by such court or officer.
Sec. 632. It shall be the duty of a witness duly
served with a subpoena to attend at the time appointed,
with any papers under his control required by the sub
poena, to answer all pertinent and legal questions, and,
unless sooner discharged, to remain until the testimony
is closed.
Seo. 633. A witness shall answer questions legal and
pertinent to the matter in issue, though his answer may
establish a claim against himself ; but ne need not give
an answer which shall have a tendency to subject him to
punishment for a felony, or need he give an answer
which will have a direct tendency to degrade his char
acter, unless it be to the very fact in issue or to a fact
from which the fact in issue would be presumed.
Sec. 634. Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to
be sworn or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an
affidavit or deposition when required, may be punished
as a contempt by the court or officer issuing the sub-
pena, or requiring the witness to be sworn ; and if the
witness be a party, his complaint or answer may be
stricken out.
Sec. 635. A witness disobeying a subpoena shall also
forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of one hundred
dollars and all damages which he may sustain by the
failure of the witness to attend, which forfeiture and
damage may be recovered in a civil action.
Sec. 636. In ease of failure of a witness to attend,
the court or officer issuing the subpoena, upon proof of
the service thereof, and of the failure of the witness,
may issue a warrant to the sheriff of the county to arrest
the witness and bring him before the court or officer
where his attendance was required.
Sec. 637. If the witness be a prisoner confined in
jail or prison within this Territory, an order for his ex-
ami nation in the prison upon deposition, or for his temporary
removal and production before a court or officer
for the purpose of being orally examined, may be made
as follows :
First—By the court itself in which the action or
special proceeding is pending.
Second—By a judge of the Supreme Court, district
court, or probate judge of the county where the action
or proceeding is pending, if before a judge or other
person out of court.

by affidavit showing the nature of the action or proceed-
ing, the testimony expected from the witness, and its
materiality.
Sec. 639. If the witness be imprisoned in 4;he county
where the action or proceeding is pending, his produc-
tion may be required. In all other cases his examina
tion, when allowed, shall be taken upon deposition.
Sec. 640. Every person who has been in good faith
served with a subpoena to attend as a witness before a
court, judge, commissioner, referee, or other person, in
a cause where the disobedience of the witness may be
punished as a contempt, 6hall be exonerated from arrest,
in a civil action, while going to the place of attendance,
necessarily remaining there, and returning therefrom.
Sec. 641. The arrest of a witness contrary to the
last section shall be void ; but an officer shall not be
liable to the party for making the arrest in ignorance of
the facts creating the exoneration, but shall be liable for
any subsequent detention of the party, if such party
claim the exemption, and make an affidavit stating :
First—That ne has been served with a subpoena to
attend as a witness before a court, officer, or other
person, specifying the same, the place of attendance,
and the action or proceeding in which the subpoena wajs
