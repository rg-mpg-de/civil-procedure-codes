§ 3. The rule of the common law, that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed, has no application to this Code.

§ 8. Every other remedy is a special proceeding.

§ 9. Actions are of two kinds: 1. Civil: and 2. Criminal.

§ 10. A civil action arises out of, 1. An obligation: 2. An injury.

§ 11. An obligation is a legal duty, by which one person is bound to the performance of an act towards another, and arises from, 1. The contract of the parties; or 2. The operation of law, as in the case of a statute or judgment.

§ 12. An injury is of two kinds: 1. To the person: and 2. To property.

§ 13. An injury to property consists in depriving its owner of the benefit of it, which is done by taking, withholding, deteriorating, or destroying it.

§ 14. Every other injury is an injury to the person.

§ 15. A criminal action arises out of an act or omission forbidden by law, and to which is annexed, upon conviction, either of the following punishments: 1. Death: 2. Imprisonment: 3. Fine: 4. Removal from office; or 5. Disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under this state.

§ 16. A civil action is prosecuted by one party against another, for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong.

§ 17. A criminal action is prosecuted by the state, as a party, against a person charged with a public offence, for the punishment thereof.

§ 18. When the violation of a right admits of both a civil and criminal remedy, the right to prosecute the one is not merged in the other.

For the detention of persons committed in default of security to appear as witnesses in a criminal action, as provided in the code of criminal procedure: 2. For the detention of persons committed for trial for a public offence: 3. For the confinement of persons committed for a contempt, or upon civil process: and 4. For the confinement of persons sentenced to imprisonment therein, upon conviction for a public offence.

§ 417. In the city and county of New-York, the sheriff has the custody of the county jail for the confinement of persons committed for contempt or upon civil process. The prison in that city and county, for the detention of persons committed in default of security to appear as witnesses in a criminal action, or charged with crime and committed for trial, or sentenced to imprisonment therein upon conviction of a public offence, is known as the city prison; and that for the imprisonment therein upon conviction of a public offence, is known as the penitentiary. Both these prisons are under the charge of the governors of the alms house of the city of New-York, whose powers in this respect are regulated by special statutes.

§ 418. The sheriff may appoint a keeper of the county jail, for whose acts as such he is responsible.

§ 419. The county jail must be provided by the supervisors of the county, and must contain a sufficient number of rooms, 1. For the confinement of persons, committed for trial in criminal actions, separate and distinct from prisoners under sentence: 2. For the confinement of prisoners, under sentence: 3. For the confinement of persons committed on civil process for contempt, or as witnesses, separate from those mentioned in the last two subdivisions.

§ 420. Persons committed on criminal process and detained for trial, and those committed for contempt or upon civil process, must be kept in separate rooms from those in which persons convicted and under sentence, are confined; and on no pretense whatever, can persons detained for trial or committed for contempt or on civil process, be kept or put in the same room with those convicted and under sentence.

§ 421. Male and female prisoners, (except husband and wife,) must not be kept or put in the same room. The supervisors of each county must as soon as can conveniently be done, so construct or alter the jail or other prison of the county, as to enable the sheriff to confine all persons committed for trial or upon conviction for public offences, in separate rooms. And after such provision is made, each person must be confined in a separate room, and not be permitted to associate with another prisoner.

§ 422. The buildings now used as county jails are continued as such, until other buildings are designated for that purpose by the supervisors of the county.

§ 423. Except as provided in this article, the regulations of the county jails and prisons, in respect to prisoners committed thereto for trial or sentence upon conviction for a public offence, are prescribed by special statutes.

§ 424. When them is no jail in the county, or when the jail becomes unfit or unsafe for the confinement of prisoners, the county judge must, by a written appointment, filed with the county clerk, designate the jail of a contiguous county for the confinement of the prisoners of his county, or of any of them, and may at any time modify or annul the appointment.

§ 425. A copy of the appointment, certified by the county clerk, must be served on the sheriff and keeper of the jail designated; who must receive into his jail, and safely keep, all prisoners authorized to be confined therein pursuant to the last section; and who is responsible for the safe keeping of the persons so committed, in the same manner and to the same extent, as if he were sheriff of the county for whose use his jail is designated; and with respect to the persons so committed, he is deemed the sheriff of the county from which they were removed.

§ 426. If a person confined on civil process, have been previously admitted to the jail liberties of the county for which the designation is made, he may remain within those liberties, or may be removed to the jail designated, by the sheriff to whom he has given an undertaking for the liberties, in the same cases and in the same manner as the sheriff might legally confine him in the jail of his own county.

§ 427. If a person in the custody of the sheriff of the county for which the designation has been made, be entitled to the jail liberties, he must be confined within the jail liberties, of the original county, as if no such designation had been made, but may be removed by the sheriff to the jail so designated, and confined therein, in the same cases and in the same manner, as he might legally confine him in the jail of his own county.

§ 428. If a person confined in the jail so designated, on civil process, or removed there, as provided in section 425, be entitled to the jail liberties, the sheriff of the county in which the jail so designated is, must admit him to the jail liberties, as if he had been originally arrested by him.

§ 429. When a jail is erected in the county for whose use the designation was made, or its jail is rendered fit and safe for the confinement of prisoners, the county judge of that county must, by a written revocation, filed with the county clerk thereof, declare that the necessity for the designation has ceased and that it is revoked.

§ 430. The county clerk must immediately serve a copy of the revocation upon the sheriff of his county, who must thereupon remove his prisoners to his own jail; and if a prisoner have been admitted to the jail liberties of the other county, he must also be removed, and is entitled to the jail liberties of the county to which he is removed, as if he had been originally arrested therein.

§ 431. The sheriff of a county in which there is more than one jail, may confine his prisoners in either of them, and may remove them from one jail to another in the county, when he deems it necessary for their safe keeping or for their appearance at court.

§ 432. When a county jail or a building contiguous to it is on fire, and there is reason to apprehend that the prisoners may be injured or endangered, the sheriff or jailer may remove them to a safe and convenient place, and there confine them, so long as is necessary to avoid the danger.

§ 433. When a pestilence or contagious disease breaks out in or near to a jail, and the physician thereof certifies that it is likely to endanger the health of the prisoners, the county judge of the county, or the mayor or recorder of a city in which it is situated, may, by a written appointment, designate a safe and convenient place in the county, or the jail of a contiguous county, as the place of their confinement. The appointment must be filed in the office of the county clerk, and must authorize the sheriff to remove the prisoners to the place or jail designated, and there confine them, until they can be safely returned to the jail from which they were taken.

§ 434. The board of supervisors of each county must, from time to time, appoint a physician to the jail of the county; and if there be more than one jail in the county, a physician to each jail.

§ 435. Intoxicating liquors must not, on any pretense, be sold in a county jail; nor can they be brought into a jail for the use of the person confined therein, without a written permit by the physician.

§ 436. A person who sells or brings into jail intoxicating liquors, contrary to the last section, and a sheriff or other officer employed about a jail, who knowingly suffers them to be sold or used contrary thereto, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction, is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, or both; and a sheriff so convicted, shall forfeit his office.

§ 437. A sheriff or jailer, upon whom a paper in a judicial proceeding, directed to a prisoner in his custody, is served, must forthwith deliver it to the prisoner, with a note thereon of the time of its service. For a neglect to do so, he is liable to the prisoner for all damages occasioned thereby; and by a willful omission in this respect, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 438. On the written application of the sheriff, with the assent of the county judge, or in the city of New-York, of the recorder or city judge, the governor may authorize the sheriff to organize a guard, not exceeding a specified number, for the protection of the county jail or any other prison in the county, or to arrest or detain a prisoner, or to enforce the process, order or judgment of a court. He may also authorize the sheriff to contract with one or more uniform companies to form the guard, and may at any time revoke or modify the authority.

§ 439. The guard must be under the command of the officers designated by the governor, or if he make no designation, under that of the sheriff, and of such civil and military officers as he may assign; and is subject to the regulations and penalties prescribed by the governor, before or after its organization. The governor may also direct the delivery to the guard, of such ammunition as he may deem necessary.

§ 440. The guard is entitled to the allowance agreed upon before or after their employment, not exceeding one dollar a day for a private, or two dollars a day for an officer.

§ 411. The comptroller may require vouchers and proofs of the agreement, services and expenses, relating to the guard, and may allow such sum therefore as he deems just. He may draw therefore, upon the state treasury, and must charge it to the county for whose benefit it was paid, and certify the amount thereof, to the treasurer of the county, by whom it must be laid before the supervisors at their next annual meeting.

§ 442. The supervisors must thereupon direct the amount to be levied and collected, as a county charge; but if they think it would be unreasonably burdensome to raise it all in one year, they may divide it into not exceeding three equal parts, and order it to be levied in an equal proportion in three successive years.

§ 443. When collected in whole or in part, the money must be paid to the county treasurer, by whom it must be paid to the state treasurer, to the credit of the county, on or before the first day of May, after its collection.

§ 444. The sheriff, when he deems it necessary, may with the assent of the county judge, or, in the city and county of New-York, of the recorder or city judge, employ a temporary guard for the protection of the county jail, or of any other prison in his county, or for the safe keeping of prisoners, until a guard can be organized, as provided in section 438 ; the expenses of which are a county charge.

The liberties must be laid out as nearly as maybe, in a square; except that a stream of water, canal or highway, may be adopted as an exterior line, though not in a straight line, or at right angles with the other exterior lines: 2. They must not exceed five hundred acres in extent, and must include the courthouse, and the office of the county clerk: 3.

§ 448.

But when they have been fixed by statute, no alteration can be made excluding a part of the existing jail liberties.

§ 449. A copy of the order establishing or altering the jail liberties, must be filed with the county clerk, by whom a certified copy must be immediately delivered to the sheriff, which must be conspicuously posted in the county jail.

§ 450. A person in the custody of the sheriff, in a civil action, by virtue of an order of arrest or an execution, or upon a surrender in exoneration of bail, or upon a commitment, for not paying money, may go at large within the jail liberties, with the consent of the sheriff. He must, however, be admitted to the jail liberties, upon giving security therefore, as provided in the next section.

§ 451. The security for the jail liberties must be by a written undertaking, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, stating their places of residence and occupations, to the effect that the prisoner shall not go beyond the jail liberties, until legally discharged, or that the sureties will pay to the person at whose suit the prisoner is in custody, a sum mentioned in the undertaking, and which must be as follows: 1. If upon an order of arrest, or a surrender in exoneration of bail, in a civil action, before judgment, the sum recovered by the judgment, not exceeding that mentioned in the warrant of arrest, with interest and the sheriff ’s fees. 2. If upon an execution in a civil action, or a commitment for not paying money, a sum not exceeding that mentioned therein, with interest and the sheriff’s fees.

§ 452. If the sheriff at any time discover that either of the sureties for the jail liberties is insufficient, he may re-commit -the prisoner to jail, until other sufficient security be given.

§ 453. The sureties, at any time before judgment against them upon their undertaking, may surrender the prisoner, or he may surrender himself to the sheriff or jailer, in exoneration of his sureties from a future liability, but not from a liability incurred before the surrender. The sheriff or jailer must thereupon, on the written requirement of the sureties, receive the prisoner into custody, and must endorse the surrender upon the undertaking, and if required, give to the sureties a certificate thereof.

§ 454. If a prisoner, allowed by the sheriff to go at large within the jail liberties, go beyond them without the consent, connivance or procurement of the adverse party, the sheriff in whose custody he is, may pursue and re-take him, as if he had escaped from the jail.

Judgment against sheriff, when evidence against sureties.

Punishment of sheriff, &c., for conniving at escape. 

§ 455. A prisoner committed to the county jail for a contempt, or for trial or upon conviction for a public offence, or in default of security to appear as a witness in a criminal action, must be actually confined in the jail, until he is legally discharged; and if he be permitted to go at large out of the jail, except by virtue of a legal order or process, it is an escape, and the sheriff or jailer permitting it is punishable for a misdemeanor; and when the prisoner escaping is also held until he pay a sum of money to a private party, that party may recover, in a civil action against the sheriff, his damages sustained by reason of the escape.

§ 456. A sheriff who suffers the escape of a prisoner, arrested or in jail, without the consent or connivance of the party in whose behalf the arrest or imprisonment was made, is liable to an action by such party therefore as follows: 1. When the arrest is upon an order of arrest in a civil action, when the presence of the defendant at the return of the summons is necessary to enable the plaintiff to proceed in the action, and the defendant does not appear at the time and place specified for the return of the summons: 2. When the arrest or imprisonment is upon an order of arrest in any other civil action, or upon a surrender in exoneration of the sheriff or of bail, and the defendant is not found upon an execution against his person, issued to the proper county on a judgment in such action: 3. When the arrest is on an execution or commitment to enforce the payment of money, and the party arrested is not recaptured or surrendered into custody, at the expiration of the time limited for the service thereof, or legally discharged therefrom: 4. When a person is imprisoned on an execution or commitment to enforce the payment of money, and he escapes after the time limited for the service and is not recaptured or surrendered before an action brought for the escape.

§ 458. An action for the escape of a prisoner confined in a jail for either of the causes mentioned in section 450, or admitted to the jail liberties, may be brought, by the adverse party against either the sheriff or the sureties for the jail liberties; but the election to sue the sureties discharges the sheriff.

§ 459. The action cannot however be maintained, if, after his escape and before the commencement of the action, the prisoner return to the jail or the liberties thereof, or be taken by the sheriff.

§ 460. If the action be brought against the sheriff, and he give written notice thereof to the prisoner or to his sureties, a judgment against the sheriff is conclusive evidence of his right to recover against the prisoner or his sureties, as to any matter which was or might have been controverted in the action against the sheriff. In an action by the sheriff against the prisoner or his sureties, the judgment against the sheriff for the escape of the prisoner, is evidence of the damages sustained by him, in the same manner as if it had been collected; and he is also entitled to recover his costs and reasonable expenses in defending the action against him, as part of his damages.

§ 461. If the action be brought against the sheriff, when security for the jail liberties has been taken, the court must, unless the escape was with the assent of the sheriff, stay all proceedings upon a judgment thereon against him, until the expiration of a reasonable time to enable him to prosecute the sureties, and collect from them the amount of the judgment be may recover.

§ 462. A sheriff, jailer or other officer, who demands or receives a reward or gratuity, to aid, assist or connive at the escape of a prisoner in his custody, is punishable for a misdemeanor; and if he be a sheriff, forfeits his office.

In the case of a defendant against whom no personal claim is made, the plaintiff may deliver to him with the summons, a notice subscribed by the plaintiff or his attorney, setting forth the general object of the action, a brief description of the property, affected by it, if it effect specific real or personal property, and that no personal claim is made against such defendant. If a defendant, on whom such notice is served, unreasonably defend the action he must pay costs to the plaintiff.

§ 626. In an action affecting the title to real property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, may file with the clerk of each county in which the property is situated, a notice of the pendency of such action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action, and a description of the property in that county affected thereby, If the action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage, such notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and must contain the date of the mortgage, the names of the parties thereto, and the time and place of recording the same. From the time of filing, and for two years thereafter only, the pendency of the action is constructive notice to a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby, but the notice may be refiled from time to time with the same effect.

§ 627. The summons may be served by the sheriff of the county where the defendant is found, or by any other person, not a party to the action, the service must be made, and the summons returned, with proof of the service, to the person whose name is subscribed thereto, with all reasonable diligence. The person subscribing the summons, may, at his option, by an endorsement on the summons, fix a time for the service thereof, and the service must then be made accordingly.

§ 628. The summons must be served by delivering a copy thereof, as follows: 1. If the suit be against a corporation, to the president or other head of the corporation, secretary, cashier, or managing agent thereof: 2. If against a minor under the age of fourteen years, to such minor personally, and also to his father, mother, or guardian, or if there be none within the state, then to any person having the care and control of such minor, or with whom he resides or in whose service he is employed: 3. If against a person judicially declared to be of unsound mind, or incapable of conducting his own affairs in consequence of habitual drunkenness, and for whom a committee has been appointed, to such committee, and to the defendant personally: 4. In all other cases to the defendant personally.

§ 629. Where the person on whom the service of the summons is to he made, cannot, after due diligence, be found within the state, and that fact appears by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court or a judge thereof, and it in like manner appears that a cause of action exists against the defendant, in respect to whom the service is to be made, or that he is a necessary or proper party to an action, relating to real property in this state, such court or judge may grant an order that the service be made, by the publication of a summons, in either of the following cases: 1. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation: 2. Where the defendant being a resident of this state, has departed therefrom with intent to defraud his. creditors, or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself concealed therein, with the like intent. 3. Where he is not a resident of this state, but has property therein, and the action arises on obligation, and the court has jurisdiction oi the subject of the action: 4. Where the subject of the action is real or personal property in this state, and the defendant has, or claims, a lien or interest, actual or contingent, therein, or the relief demanded consists, wholly or partly, in excluding the defendant from any interest therein: 5. Where the action arises upon a mortgage on property in this state, and the defendant is personally chargeable with the debt for which the mortgage is security: 6. Where the action is for divorce, in the cases prescribed by law.

§ 630. The order must direct the publication to be made in two newspapers to be designated, as most likely to give notice to the person to be served, and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week, for six weeks. In case of publication, the court or judge must also direct a copy of the summons and complaint, to be forthwith deposited in the post office, directed to the person to be served, at his place of residence, unless it appear that such residence is neither known to the party making the application, nor can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him. When publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint, out of the state, is equivalent to publication, and deposit in the post office. In either case the service of the summons is to be deemed complete, at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.

§ 631. If the summons be not personally served on a defendant, nor received by him through the post office, in the cases provided for in the last two sections, he or his representatives, on application and sufficient cause shown, at any time before judgment, must be allowed to defend the action; and, except in an action for divorce, the defendant or his representatives, may in like manner, be allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just; and if the defense be successful, and the judgment, or any part thereof, have been collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution may thereupon be compelled as the court directs.

§ 632. Where the action is against two or more defendants, and the summons is served on one or more but not on all of them, the plaintiff may proceed as follows: 1. If the action be against the defendants jointly indebted upon an obligation, he may proceed against the defendants served, unless the court otherwise direct, and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced against the joint property of all, and the separate property of the defendants served, and, if they are subject to arrest, against their persons: or, 2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may proceed against the defendants served, in the same manner as if they were the only defendants.

§ 633. Proof of the service of the summons, and of the complaint or notice, if any, accompanying the same must be as follows : 1. If served by the sheriff, his certificate thereof; or 2. If by any other person, his affidavit thereof; or 3. In case of publication, the affidavit of the printer, or his foreman, or principal clerk, showing the same; and an affidavit of a deposit of a copy of the summons in the post-office, if the same shall have been deposited: or 4. The written admission of the defendant: In case of service, otherwise than by publication, the certificate, affidavit or admission must state the time and place of the service.

§ 634. From the time of the service of the summons in a civil action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

That there is another action pending between the same parties, for the same cause: or, 4. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant: or, 5. That several causes of action have been improperly united: or, 6. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

§ 641. The demurrer must distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the complaint are taken. Unless it do so, it may be disregarded. It may be taken to the whole complaint, or to any of the causes of action alleged therein.

§ 642. If the complaint be amended, a copy thereof must be served on the defendant, who must answer it within twenty days, or the plaintiff, upon filing with the clerk proof of the service, and of the defendant’s omission may proceed to obtain judgment, as in other cases of failure to answer, but where an application to the court for judgment is necessary, eight days’ notice thereof must be given to the defendant.

§ 644. If no such objection be taken, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant must be deemed to have waived the same, excepting only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, and the objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

Answer, what to contain.
When counterclaim may be set up.
Counterclaim precludes another action for the same cause.
Counterclaim not barred by death or assignment.
Answer may contain several grounds of defense.
Amendment allowed after trial, on complaint and answer.

§ 645. The answer of the defendant must contain: 1. A denial of each allegation of the complaint controverted by the defendant, or of any knowledge or information thereof, sufficient to form a belief: 2. A statement of any new matter, constituting a defense or counterclaim, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.

§ 646. The counterclaim mentioned in the last section, must be one existing in favor of a defendant, and against plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and arising out of one of the following causes of action: 1. A cause of action, arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint, as the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim, or connected with the subject of the action: 2. In an action arising on obligation, any other cause of action arising also on obligation, and existing at the commencement of the action.

§ 647. If the defendant omit to set up a counterclaim in the cases mentioned in the first subdivision of the last section, he cannot afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff therefore.

§ 648. When cross demands have existed between persons, under such circumstances, that if one had brought an action against the other, a counterclaim could have been set up, neither can be deprived of the benefit thereof, by the assignment or death of the other, but the two demands must be deemed compensated, so far as they equal each other.

§ 649. The defendant may set forth, by answer, as many defenses and counterclaims as he may have. They must each be separately stated, and the several defenses must refer to the causes of action which they are intended to answer, in a manner by which they may be intelligibly distinguished. The defendant may also answer one or more of the several causes of action alleged in the complaint and demur to the residue.

§ 650. If the answer set up new matter, which is not replied to as provided in the next section, and the issue be tried on complaint and answer alone, and judgment be given thereon for the plaintiff, the court may permit the defendant to withdraw or amend the answer, upon such terms as may be just.

CHAPTER V. THE REPLY.

When the answer contains a counterclaim, a reply may be put in, and what it may contain.

§ 651. When the answer contains new matter constituting a counter-claim, the plaintiff may within twenty days, reply to such new matter, denying each allegation controverted by him, or any knowledge or information thereof sufficient to form a belief; and he may allege, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended, any new matter, not inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a defense to the counterclaim.

CHAPTER VI. GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING.

Verification of pleadings.
How to state an account in pleading.
Pleadings to be liberally construed.
Irrelevant or redundant matter to be stricken out.
Description of real property in a pleading.
Judgments how to be pleaded.
Conditions precedent, how to be pleaded.
Private statutes how to be pleaded.
Libel and slander, how stated in complaint.
Answer in such cases.
In actions to recover property distrained for damage, answer need not set forth title.
What causes of action may be joined in the same action.
Allegations not denied; when to be deemed true.
A material allegation defined.

§ 652. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party, or his attorney, and the complaint, answer and reply, must be verified by the party, his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true. The verification must be made, by the affidavit of the party, or, if there be several parties united in interest and pleading together, by one at least of such parties, if such party be within the state and capable of making the affidavit; otherwise the affidavit may be made by the agent or attorney of the party. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the action or defense be founded upon a written instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the affidavit is made by the agent or attorney, it must set forth the reason of his making it. The verification may be omitted, when an admission of the truth of the complaint might subject the party to prosecution for felony. And no pleading, verified as herein required, can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading.

§ 653. It is not necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, where they exceed twenty in number, but he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days, after a demand thereof in writing, a copy of the account verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a county judge, may order a further account, when the one delivered is defective.

§ 654. In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.

§ 655. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person aggrieved thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or uncertain, that the precise nature of the charge or defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain, by amendment.

§ 656. In an action for the recovery of real property, it must be described in the complaint with such convenient certainty, as to enable an officer upon execution to identify it.

§ 657. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction. but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.

§ 658. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it is not necessary to state the facts, showing such performance; but it may be stated generally, that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish on the trial the facts showing such performance.

§ 659. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it is sufficient to refer to such statute, by its title and the day of its passage, and the court must thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

§ 660. In an action for libel or slander, it is not necessary to state in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it is sufficient to state generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff must establish, on the trial, that it was so published or spoken.

§ 661. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of, damages; and whether he prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

§ 662. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained for doing damage, an answer that the defendant, or person by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing damage thereon, is sufficient without setting forth the title to such real property.

§ 663. The plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the same complaint, where they all arise out of 1. Contract, express or implied: or, 2. Claims to recover specific real property, with or without damages, for the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same: or, 3. Claims to recover specific personal property, with or without damages, for the withholding thereof: or, 4. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation of law: or, 5. Injuries to character: or, 6. Other injuries to person and property, or either: But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one only of these classes, and must affect all the parties to the action, and not require different places of trial, and must he separately stated.

§ 664. Every material allegation of the complaint not specifically controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section 645; and every material allegation of new matter in the answer constituting a counter claim, not specifically controverted by the reply, as prescribed in section 651, must for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer not relating to a counter claim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial, or avoidance as the case may require.

§ 665. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essential to the claim or defense, and which could not be stricken from the pleading, without leaving it insufficient.

CHAPTER VI. MISTAKES IN PLEADING, AND AMENDMENTS.

Material variances, how provided for.
Immaterial variances, how provided for.
What to be deemed a variance.
Amendments of course, and after demurrer.
Amendments by the court.
Suing a party by a fictitious name, when allowed.
No error or defect to be regarded, unless it affect substantial rights.
Supplemental complaint, answer and reply.

§ 666. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof; is to be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense, upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged, that a party has been so misled that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court and it must be proved to the satisfaction of the court and it must be shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as may be just.

§ 667. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment, without costs.

§ 668. Where, however, the allegation of the claim or defense to which the proof is directed is unproved not in some particular or particulars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance, within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

§ 669. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course, without, costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before the period for answering it expires, or, if it do not delay the trial, it can be so amended at any time within twenty days after service of the answer to such pleading. In such case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, either at a general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the defendant to answer, upon such terms as to trial by the court or referees, or as to costs, or otherwise, as may be just.

§ 670. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. The court may likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer or reply to be made, after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarging such time, and may also, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, or other proceeding, taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; and may supply an omission, in any proceeding. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to the provisions of this code, the court may permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto.

§ 671. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding, by any name; and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

§ 672. The court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect, in the pleadings or proceedings, which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and no judgment can be reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect.

§ 673. The plaintiff and defendant respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint, answer or reply.

§ 675. The defendant may be arrested, as hereinafter prescribed, in the following cases: 1. In an action for the recovery of damages, on a cause of action arising on an obligation, where the defendant is not a resident of the state, or is about to remove therefrom, or where the action is for a willful injury to person, or to property knowing the property to belong to another: 2. In an action for a fine, or penalty, or on a promise to marry, or for money or property embezzled, or fraudulently misapplied, or converted to his own use, by a public officer, or an officer of a corporation, or an attorney, factor, broker, agent or clerk, in the course of his employment as such, or by any other person in a fiduciary capacity, or for misconduct or neglect in office or in a professional employment: 3. In an action to recover the possession of personal property unjustly detained, where the property or any part thereof has been concealed, removed or disposed of, so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff: 4. When the defendant has been guilty of a fraud, in contracting the debt, or incurring the obligation, for which the action is brought, or in concealing or disposing of the property, for the taking, detention, or conversion of which the action is brought: 5. When the defendant has removed, concealed or disposed of, his property, or is about to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors: 6. When the arrest of the defendant is expressly authorized by special statutes, in an action for a fine or penalty, or for a willful violation of duty. But no female can be arrested, in any action, except for a willful injury to person, character or property.

§ 676. An order for the arrest of the defendant, must be obtained from a judge of the court in which the action is brought, or if the action be in the supreme court from a county judge.

§ 677. The order may be made, whenever it appears to the judge by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or of any other person, that a sufficient cause of action exists, and that the case is one of those mentioned in section 675.

§ 678. Before making the order, the judge must require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with or without sureties, to the effect, that if the defendant recover judgment, the plaintiff will pay all costs and charges that may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which must be at least one hundred dollars. If the undertaking be executed by the plaintiff, without sureties. he must annex thereto an affidavit, that he is a resident and householder or freeholder within the state, and worth double the sum specified in the undertaking, over all his debts and liabilities.

§ 679. The order may be made, to accompany the summons, or at any time afterwards, before judgment. It must require the sheriff of the county, where the defendant may be found, forthwith to arrest him and hold him to bail in a specified sum, and to return the order at a time and place therein mentioned, to the plaintiff or attorney by whom it is subscribed or endorsed.

§ 680. The affidavit and order of arrest must be delivered to the sheriff, who, upon arresting the defendant, must deliver to him a copy thereof.

§ 681. The sheriff must execute the order, by arresting the defendant and keeping him in custody, until discharged by law.

§ 682. The defendant, at any time before execution, may be discharged from the arrest, either upon giving bail, or upon depositing the amount mentioned in the order of arrest, as provided in this chapter.

§ 683. The defendant may give bail, by causing a written undertaking to be executed by two or more sufficient bail, stating their places of residence and occupations, to the effect, that the defendant shall at all times render himself amenable to the process of the court, during the pendency of the action, and to such as may be issued to enforce the judgment therein, or if he be arrested for the cause mentioned in the third subdivision of section 675, an undertaking to the same effect as that provided by section 707.

§ 684. At any time before a failure to comply with their undertaking, the bail may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or he may surrender himself to the sheriff of the county where he was arrested, in the following manner: 1. A certified copy of the undertaking of the bail must be delivered to the sheriff, who shall detain the defendant in his custody thereon, as upon an order of arrest, and by a certificate in writing acknowledge the surrender: 2. Upon the production of a copy of the undertaking and sheriff ’s certificate, a judge of the court or, if the action be in the supreme court, a county judge may, upon a notice to the plaintiff, of eight days with a copy of the certificate, order that the bail be exonerated: and on filing the order and the papers used on such application, they shall be exonerated accordingly. But this section does not apply to an arrest for the cause mentioned in the third subdivision of section 675.

§ 685. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail; at any time or place, before they are finally charged, may themselves arrest him, or by a written authority, endorsed on a certified copy of the undertaking, may empower any person of suitable age and discretion to do so.

§ 686. In case of failure to comply with the undertaking, the bail can be proceeded against by action only.

§ 687. The bail may be exonerated, either by the death of the defendant, or his imprisonment in a state prison, or by his legal discharge from the obligation to render himself amenable to the process, or by his surrender to the sheriff of the county where he was arrested, in execution thereof, within twenty days after the commencement of the action against the bail, or within such further time as may be granted by the court.

§ 688. Within the time limited for that purpose, the sheriff must deliver the order of arrest to the plaintiff or attorney by whom it is subscribed, with his return endorsed, and the undertaking of the bail or a copy thereof. The plaintiff, within ten days thereof, may serve upon the sheriff, a notice that he does not accept the bail, or he must be deemed to have accepted it, and the sheriff shall be exonerated from liability.

§ 689. On the receipt of the undertaking or copy and notice, the sheriff or defendant may, within ten days thereafter, give to the plaintiff or attorney by whom the order of arrest is subscribed, notice of the justification of the same or other bail, (specifying the places of residence and occupations of the latter,) before a judge of the court, or county judge, or justice of the peace, at a specified time and place; the time to be not less than five, nor more than ten days thereafter. In case other bail be given, there must be a new undertaking in the form prescribed in section 683.

§ 690. The qualifications of bail must be as follows: 1. Each of them must be a resident, and householder or freeholder, within the state: 2. They must each be worth the amount specified in the order of arrest, exclusive of property exempt from execution, but the judge, or a justice of the peace, on justification, may allow more than two bail to justify severally in amounts less than that expressed in the order, if the whole justification be equivalent to that of two sufficient bail.

§ 691. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail must attend before the judge, or a justice of the peace, at the time and place mentioned in the notice, and may be examined on oath, on the part of the plaintiff, touching his sufficiency, in such manner as the judge or justice of the peace, in his discretion, may think proper. The examination must be reduced to writing and subscribed by the bail, if required by the plaintiff.

§ 692. If the judge or justice find the bail sufficient, he must annex the examination to the undertaking, endorse his allowance thereon, and cause them to be filed with the clerk; and the sheriff shall thereupon be exonerated from liability.

§ 693. The defendant may, at the time of his arrest, instead of giving bail, deposit with the sheriff the amount mentioned in the order. The sheriff must thereupon give the defendant a certificate of the deposit, and the defendant shall be discharged out of custody.

§ 694. The sheriff must, within four days after the deposit, pay the same into court; and take from the officer receiving the same, two certificates of such payment, the one of which he must deliver to the plaintiff and the other to the defendant. For any default in making such payment, the same proceedings may be had on the official bond of the sheriff to collect the sum deposited, as in other cases of delinquency.

§ 695. If money be deposited, as provided in the last two sections, bail may be given and justified upon notice, as prescribed in section 689, at any time before judgment; and thereupon the judge before whom the justification is had, must direct, in the order of allowance, that the money deposited be refunded by the sheriff to the defendant, and it must be refunded accordingly.

§ 696. Where money shall have been so deposited, if it remain on deposit at the time of an order or judgment for the payment of money to the plaintiff, the clerk must, under the direction of the court, apply the same in satisfaction thereof, and after satisfying the judgment, refund the surplus, if any, to the defendant. If the judgment be in favor of the defendant, the clerk must refund to him the whole sum deposited, and remaining unapplied.

§ 697. If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be rescued, or bail be not given or justified; or a deposit be not made instead thereof, the sheriff shall himself be liable as bail. But he may discharge himself from such liability, by the giving and justification of bail as provided in sections 689, 690, 691, and 692, at any time before process against the person of the defendant, to enforce an order or judgment in the action.

§ 698; If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff, upon his liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the same proceedings may be had on the official bond of the sheriff, to collect the deficiency, as in other cases of delinquency.

§ 699. The bail taken upon the arrest, shall, unless they justify, or other bail be given or justified, be liable to the sheriff, by action, for the damages which he may sustain by reason of such omission.

§ 700. A defendant arrested may at any time before the justification of bail, apply, on motion to vacate the order of arrest, or to reduce the amount of bail.

§ 701. If the motion be made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other proofs, in addition to those on which the order of arrest was made.

That the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant: 3. The alleged cause of the detention thereof, according to his best knowledge, information and belief. 4. That the same has not been taken for a tax assessment or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution or attachment against the property of the plaintiff; or if so seized, that it is, by statute exempt from such seizure; and, 5. The actual value of the property.

§ 704. The plaintiff may, thereupon, by an endorsement in writing upon the affidavit, require the sheriff of the county where the property is claimed may be, to take the same from the defendant, and deliver it to the plaintiff.

§ 705. Upon the receipt of the affidavit and notice, with a written undertaking, executed by one or more sufficient sureties, approved by the sheriff to the effect that they are bound, in double the value of the property as stated in the affidavit, for the prosecution of the action, for the return of the property to the defendant, if return thereof be adjudged, and for the payment to him of such sum as may, for any cause, be recovered against the plaintiff, the sheriff must forthwith take the property described in the affidavit, if it be in the possession of the defendant or his agent, and retain it in his custody. He must also, without delay, serve on the defendant a copy of the affidavit, notice and undertaking, by delivering the same to him personally, if he can be found, or to his agent, from whose possession the property is taken; or if neither can be found, by leaving them at the usual place of abode of either, with some person of suitable age and discretion.

§ 706. The defendant may within three days after the service of a copy of the affidavit and undertaking, give notice to the sheriff that he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If he fail to do so, he must be deemed to have waived all objection to them. When the defendant excepts, the sureties must justify on notice in like manner, as upon bail on arrest. And the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived as above provided, or until they justify. If the defendant except to the sureties, he cannot reclaim the property, as provided in the next section.

§ 707. At any time before the delivery of the property to the plaintiff, the defendant may, if he do not except to the sureties of the plaintiff, require the return thereof, upon giving to the sheriff a written undertaking, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound, in double the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff, for the delivery thereof to the plaintiff, if such delivery be adjudged, and for the payment to him of such sum as may, for any cause, be recovered against the defendant. If a return of the property be not so required within three days after the taking and service of notice to the defendant, it must be delivered to the plaintiff, except as provided in section 712.

§ 708. The defendant's sureties, upon notice to the plaintiff of not less than two nor more than six days, must justify before a judge or justice of the peace, in the same manner as upon bail on arrest; and upon such justification, the sheriff must deliver the property to the defendant. The sheriff shall be responsible for the defendant’s sureties, until they justify, or until the justification is completed or expressly waived, and may retain the property until that time, but if they or others in their place, fail to justify, at the time and place appointed, he must deliver the property to the plaintiff.

§ 709. The qualification of sureties and their justification, must be such as are prescribed by sections 690 and 691, in respect to bail upon an order of arrest.

§ 710. If the property or any part thereof be concealed in a building or enclosure, the sheriff must publicly demand its delivery. If it be not delivered, he must cause the building or enclosure to be broken open, and take the property into his possession, and if necessary, he may call to his aid the power of his county.

§ 711. When the sheriff shall have taken property, as in this chapter provided, he must keep it in a secure place, and deliver it to the party entitled thereto, upon receiving his lawful fees for taking, and his necessary expenses for keeping, the same.

§ 712. If the property taken be claimed by any other person than the defendant or his agent, and such person make affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such title or right and serve the same upon the sheriff, the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property, or deliver it to the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff, on demand of him or his agent, indemnify the sheriff against such claim, by an undertaking, executed by two sufficient sureties, accompanied by their affidavits, that they are each worth double the value of the property as specified in the affidavit of the plaintiff, and freeholders and householders of the county. And no claim to such property by any other person than the defendant or his agent, shall be valid against the sheriff unless so made and notwithstanding such claim, when so made, ‘he may retain the property a reasonable time to demand such indemnity.

§ 713. The sheriff must file the notice and affidavit with his proceedings thereon, with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending, within twenty days after taking the property mentioned therein.

§ 715. Where it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act, the commission or continuance of which, during the litigation, would produce great or irreparable injury to the plaintiff, or when during the litigation, it appears that the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary injunction may be granted, to restrain such act. And where, during the pendency of an action, the defendant threatens, or is about to remove, or dispose of, his property, with intent to defraud his creditors, a temporary injunction may be granted to restrain such removal or disposition.

§ 716. The injunction may be granted at the time of issuing the summons, or at any time afterwards, before judgment, upon its appearing satisfactorily to the court or judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or of any other person, that sufficient grounds exist therefore. A copy of the affidavit must be served with the injunction.

§ 717. An injunction cannot be allowed, after the defendant has answered, unless upon notice, or upon an order to show cause; but in such case, the defendant may be restrained, until the decision of the court or judge, granting or refusing the injunction.

§ 718. Where no provision is made by special statute, as to security upon an injunction, the court or judge must require a written undertaking, on the part of the plaintiff, with or without sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined, such damages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, as he may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court, finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference, or otherwise, as the court may direct.

§ 719. If the court or judge deem it proper that the defendant, or any of several defendants, should be heard before granting the injunction, an order may be made requiring cause to be shown, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted; and the defendant may in the mean time be restrained.

§ 720. An injunction to suspend the general and ordinary business of a corporation must not be granted except by the court. Nor must it be granted, without due notice of the application therefore, to the proper officers of the corporation, except where the people of this state are a party to the proceeding, and except in proceedings to enforce the liability of stockholders in corporations and association for banking purposes, after the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, as such proceedings are or shall be provided by law, unless the plaintiff give a written undertaking, executed by two sufficient sureties, to be approved by the court, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay all damages not exceeding the sum to be mentioned in the undertaking, which such corporation may sustain, by reason of the injunction, if the court finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference, or otherwise, as the court directs.

§ 721. If the injunction be granted by a judge with out notice, the defendant, at any time before the trial, may apply, upon notice, to any judge of the court in which the action is brought, to vacate or modify the same. The application may be made upon the complaint and the affidavits on which the injunction was granted, or upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, with or without the answer.

§ 724. An order for the attachment must be obtained from a judge of the court in which the action is brought, or if the action be in the supreme court, from a county judge.

§ 725. The order may be made whenever it appears by affidavit, that a cause of action exists against such defendant, specifying the amount of the claim, and the grounds thereof; and that the defendant is either a foreign corporation, or not a resident of this state, or has departed therefrom with intent to defraud his creditors or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself concealed therein with the like intent.

§ 726. Before making the order, the judge must require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with sufficient surety, to the effect, that if the defendant recover judgment, the plaintiff will pay all costs and charges that may be awarded to tm defendant, and all damages which he may sustain, by reason of the attachment, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which must be at least two hundred and fifty dollars.

§ 727. The order must be directed to the sheriff of any county in which property of such defendant may be, and require him to attach and safely keep all the property of such defendant within his county and not exempt from execution, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s demand, the amount of which must be stated, in conformity with the complaint. Several orders may be issued at the same time, to the sheriffs of different counties.

§ 728. The rights or shares which the defendant may have in the stock of any corporation, together with the interest and profits thereon, and all other property in this state of such defendant, may be attached’ and sold to satisfy the judgment and execution.

§ 729. The sheriff, to whom the order is directed and delivered, must execute the same without delay, as follows: 1. Real property must be attached, by leaving with the occupant thereof, or if there be no occupant, in a conspicuous place thereon, a copy of the order certified by the sheriff: 2. Personal property, capable of manual delivery to the sheriff must be attached by taking it into his custody: 3. Other personal property must be attached by leaving a certified copy of the order, and a notice specifying the property attached, with a person holding the same, or as to a debt with the debtor, or as to stock or interest in stock of a corporation, with the president or other head of the same, or the secretary, cashier, or managing agent thereof. The sheriff must make a full inventory of the property attached, and return the same with the order of attachment.

§ 730. Whenever the sheriff, with an order of attachment, or with an execution against the defendant, applies to any person mentioned in the third subdivision of the last section, for the purpose of attaching or levying upon the property mentioned therein, such person must furnish him with a certificate, designating the number of rights or shares of the defendant in the stock of the corporation, with any dividend or encumbrance thereon, or the amount and description of the property held by such corporation or person, for the benefit of the defendant, or the debt owing to the defendant. If such person refuse to do so, he may be required by the court or judge to attend before him, and be examined on oath concerning the same, and disobedience to the order may be punished as a contempt.

§ 731. If any of the property attached be perishable, the sheriff must sell the same in the manner in which property is sold on execution, and immediately deposit the proceeds with the clerk of the court. He must also collect, and if necessary, in his name of office, sue for the debts and credits attached, and deposit the amount collected with the clerk. Other property attached by him, must be retained by him to answer any judgment that may be recovered in the action, unless sooner subjected to execution upon another judgment.

§ 732. The sheriff may deliver any of the property attached to the defendant, or to any other person claiming it, upon his giving a written undertaking therefore, executed by one or more sufficient sureties, engaging to re-deliver it or pay the value thereof to the sheriff, to whom execution, upon a judgment obtained by the plaintiff in that action, may be issued.

§ 733. If an action be brought upon such undertaking against the principal or his sureties, it shall be a defense, that the property for which the undertaking was given, did not, at the execution of the order of attachment, belong to the defendant against whom it was issued.

§ 734. If the property attached, be claimed by a third person as his property, the sheriff may summon a jury to try the validity of such claim and such proceedings must be had thereon, with the like effect, as in case of seizure upon execution.

§ 735. The defendant or claimant may be required to attend before the court or judge, for the purpose of giving any necessary information respecting the property attached, and may be thereupon examined on oath concerning the same.

§ 736. If judgment be recovered by the plaintiff in such action, the sheriff must satisfy the same out of the property attached by him, if it be sufficient for that purpose; 1. By paying to the plaintiff the proceeds of all sales of perishable property, and of any vessel, or share or interest therein, sold by him, or of any debts or credits collected by him, or so much as shall be necessary to satisfy the judgment: 2. If any balance remain clue, and an execution shall have been issued on the judgment, he must sell under the execution so much of the attached property, real or personal, except as provided in subdivision four of this section, as may be necessary to satisfy the balance, if enough for that purpose remain in his hands; and in case of the sale of any rights or shares in the stock of a corporation, the sheriff must execute to the purchaser a certificate of the sale, and the purchaser shall thereupon have all the rights and privileges in respect thereto which were had by the defendant. 3. If any of the attached property belonging to the defendant, shall have passed out of the hands of the sheriff, without having been sold or converted into money, the sheriff must re-possess himself of the same, and for that purpose shall have all the authority, which he had to seize the same under the attachment, and any person who shall willfully conceal or withhold such property from the sheriff, shall be liable to double damages at the suit of the party injured. 4. Until the judgment against the defendant be paid, the sheriff may collect the notes, other evidences of debt, and debts that may have been attached, and may prosecute any bond he may have taken in the course of such proceedings, and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the judgment; or, upon the order of the court, he may sell such notes, evidences and debts, and apply the proceeds in like manner. When the judgment and costs shall have been paid, the sheriff upon reasonable demand, must deliver over to the defendant the residue of the attached property or the proceeds thereof.

§ 737. The actions authorized by sections 731 and 736, to be brought by the sheriff, may be prosecuted by the plaintiff, or under his direction, upon the delivery by him to the sheriff of an undertaking executed by two sufficient sureties, to the effect, that the plaintiff will indemnify the sheriff from all damages, costs and charges on account thereof; not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars in any one action. Such sureties shall in all cases, when required by the sheriff, justify, by making an affidavit that each is a householder, and worth double the amount of the penalty: of the bond, over and above all debts and liabilities.

§ 738. If the foreign corporation, or absent, or absconding or concealed defendant, recover judgment against the plaintiff, in such action, any undertaking received by the sheriff, except such as is mentioned in the last section, all the proceeds of sales and money collected by him, and all the property attached remaining in his hands, must be delivered by him to the defendant or his agent on request; the order of attachment must be discharged, and the property released therefrom.

§ 739. Whenever the defendant shall have appeared in the action, he may apply to the judge who issued the attachment, or to the court, for an order to discharge the same, upon the execution of the undertaking mentioned in the next section ; and if the application be granted, all the proceeds of sales and moneys collected by the sheriff, and all the property attached remaining in his hands, must be released from the attachment and delivered to the defendant.

§ 740. Upon such application, the defendant must deliver to the court or judge an undertaking executed by at least two sureties, resident and freeholders in this state, approved by such court or judge, to the effect, that the sureties will on demand pay to the plaintiff, the amount of the judgment that may be recovered against the defendant in the action, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which must be at least double the amount claimed by the plaintiff in his complaint.

§ 741. The defendant may also, any time before the time for answering expires, apply on motion to vacate the order of attachment.

§ 747. Whenever, in the exercise of its authority, a court shall have ordered the deposit, or delivery, of money or other thing, and the order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the disobedience, may make an order requiring the sheriff to take the money or thing, and deposit or deliver it, in conformity with the direction of the court.

Judgment except upon failure to answer not limited to the relief asked in complaint.
Judgment dismissing actions when given.
All other judgment are on the merits.

§ 748. A judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in the action.

§ 749. Judgment may be given, for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several defendants, and it may, when the justice of the case requires it, determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side, as between themselves.

§ 750. In an action against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment is proper.

§ 751. The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, cannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint; but in any other case, the court may grant him any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint, and embraced within the issue.

§ 752. The action may be dismissed without a final determination of its merits, in the following cases: 1. By the plaintiff himself at any time before trial, if a provisional remedy has not been allowed, or counter claim made: 2. By either party, with the written consent of the other: 3. By the court, when, upon the trial and before the final submission of the case the plaintiff abandons it: 4. By the court, when the plaintiff fails to appear on the trial, and the defendant appears and asks for the dismissal: 5. By the court, on the application of some of the defendants, when there are others whom the plaintiff fails to prosecute with diligence. All other modes of dismissing an action by non-suit, or otherwise, are abolished. The dismissal mentioned in the first two subdivisions is made by an entry in the clerk’s register, and a notice served on the adverse party. Judgment may thereupon be entered accordingly.

§ 753. In every case, other than those mentioned in the last section, the judgment must be rendered on the merits.

§ 754. Though all the defendants have been served with the summons, judgment may be taken against any of them severally, when the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against such defendants, if the action had been against them alone.

CHAPTER II. JUDGMENT UPON FAILURE TO ANSWER.

§ 755. Judgment may be had, if the defendant fail to answer the complaint, as follows: 1. In an action arising on obligation, for the recovery of money only, the plaintiff may file with the clerk, proof of personal service of the summons, and that no answer has been received. The clerk must thereupon enter judgment for the amount mentioned in the summons, against the defendant, or against one or more of several defendants, in the cases provided for in section 632; 2. In other actions, the plaintiff may, upon the like proof, apply to the court, after the expiration of the time for answering, for the relief demanded in the complaint. If the taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary to enable the court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account or hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that purpose. And where the action is for the recovery of money only, or of specific, real or personal property, with damages for the withholding thereof; the court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury, or if the examination of a long account be involved, by a reference as above provided; 3. In actions, where the service of the summons was by publication, the plaintiff may in like manner apply for judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be made of the demand mentioned in the complaint, and if the defendant be not a resident of the state, must require the plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath, respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintiff or to any one for his use on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover. Before judgment the plaintiff must give satisfactory security, to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution of any property collected or received under the judgment, in case the defendant or his representatives are admitted to defend the action, and succeed in the defense.

CHAPTER III. ISSUES, AND THE MODE OF TRIAL.

Issues defined.
Issues of law.
Issues of fact. Both on same pleadings.

§ 756. Issues arise upon the pleadings, when a fact or conclusion of law is maintained by the one party and controverted by the other. They are of two kinds: 1. Of law; and, 2. Of fact.

§ 757. An issue of law arises, 1. Upon a demurrer to the complaint, or to some part thereof.

§ 758. An issue of fact arises, 1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint, controverted by the answer: or, 2. Upon new matter in the answer constituting a counter claim, controverted by the reply; or, upon other new matter in the answer: or, 3. Upon new matter in the reply: Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon different parts of the pleadings in the same action.

§ 759. A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact.

§ 760. An issue of law must be tried by the court, unless it be referred, as provided in sections 335 and 336.

§ 761. An issue of fact, in an action for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property, or for a divorce from the marriage contract on the ground of adultery, must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived, as provided in section 796, or a reference be ordered, as provided in sections 335 and 336.

§ 762. Every other issue of fact must be tried by the court, subject, however, to the right of the parties to consent, or of the court to order, that the whole issue, or any specific question of fact involved therein, be tried by a jury, or be referred, as provided in sections 335 and 336.

§ 763. All issues, whether of law or fact, triable by a jury or by the court, must be tried before a single judge. Issues of fact in the supreme court, must be tried at the circuits, issues of law in the first instance at a circuit, or special term, or before a single judge, as provided in section 49.

§ 764. At any time after issue, and at least ten days before the court, either party may give notice of trial. The party giving the notice must furnish the clerk, at least four days before the court, with a note of the issue, containing the title of the action, the names of the attorneys, and the time when the last pleading was served; and the clerk must thereupon enter the cause upon the calendar, according to the date of the issue. The issues, once placed upon the calendar of a circuit or special term, if not tried at the circuit or term for which the notice was given, need not be noticed for a subsequent circuit or term, but must remain upon the calendar, from court to court, until finally disposed of. But when an issue of law is to be tried before a judge out of court, no calendar need be made or note of issue furnished.

§ 765. The issues on the calendar must be disposed of in the following order; unless, for the convenience of parties, or the dispatch of business, the court otherwise direct; 1. Issues of fact to be tried by a jury: 2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court: 3. Issues of law.

§ 766. Either party, after the notice of trial, whether given by himself, or by the adverse party, may bring the issue to trial, and in the absence of the adverse party, unless the court, for good cause, otherwise direct, may proceed with his case, and take, a dismissal of the action, or a verdict, or judgment, as the case may require.

§ 767. A separate trial, between the plaintiff and any of several defendants, may be allowed by the court, whenever, in its opinion, justice will be thereby promoted.

§ 768. A motion to postpone a trial for the absence of evidence, can only be made upon affidavit, showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has been used to procure it. The court may also require the moving party to state the evidence which he expects to obtain, and if the adverse party thereupon admit, that such evidence would be given, and that it be considered as actually given on the trial, or offered and overruled as improper, the trial must not be postponed.

§ 769. The plaintiff must furnish the court before the trial begins with a copy of the summons and pleadings, and the offer of the defendant, if any shall have been made.

§ 770. When the action is called for trial by jury, the clerk must draw from the trial jury box of the court, the ballots containing the names of jurors, until the jury is completed or the ballots are exhausted. If the ballots become exhausted before the jury is complete, the sheriff, under the direction of the court, must summon from the bystanders or the body of the county, so many qualified persons as to complete the jury.

§ 771. As soon as the drawing of the jury is completed, an oath must be administered to each juror, that he will well and truly try the matter in issue between __ the plaintiff and __ the defendant, and a true verdict give, according to evidence.

§ 772. When the jury is completed and sworn, the ballots containing the names of the jurors sworn must be laid aside, till the jury so sworn is discharged, and then they must be returned to the box; and every ballot drawn containing the name of a juror not so sworn must be returned to the box as soon as the jury is completed.

§ 773. Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are several parties on either side, they must join in a challenge before it can be made. The challenges are to the panel and to individual jurors, as in criminal actions, except that there can be but two peremptory challenges on each side. And the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on the subject of challenges, and the disposition thereof, omitting section 415, are to apply, so far as in their nature applicable and consistent with the provisions of this code, to challenges in civil actions and the disposition thereof; substituting “plaintiff” for “people” and for “person alleged to be injured by the offence charged, or on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted.”

§ 774. When the jury has been completed and sworn, the trial must proceed in the following order, unless the court, for special reasons, otherwise directs: 1. The plaintiff after stating the issue, must open the case and produce the evidence on his part: 2. The defendant may then open his defense and offer his evidence in support thereof: 3. The parties may then respectively offer rebutting evidence only, unless the court for good reason, in furtherance of justice, permit them to offer evidence upon their original case: 4. When the evidence is concluded, unless the case is submitted to the jury on either side, or on both sides, without argument, the defendant must commence, and the plaintiff conclude the argument to the jury: 5. If several defendants, having separate defenses, appear by different counsel, the court must determine their relative order in the evidence and argument: 6. The court may then charge the jury.

§ 775. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is proper that the jury should have a view of real property which is the subject of the litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of proper officers, to the place, which will be shown to them by the judge, or by a person appointed by the court for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than the judge or person so appointed, must speak to them on any subject connected with the trial.

§ 776. The jurors may be kept together in charge of proper officers, or may, in the discretion of the court, at any time before the submission of the cause to the jury, be permitted to separate. In either case, they may be admonished by the court, that it is their duty not to converse with any other person or among themselves, on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express any opinion thereon, until the cause is finally submitted to them.

§ 777. If, after the impaneling of the jury, and before verdict, a juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order him to be discharged. In that case a new juror may be sworn, and the trial begin anew, or the jury may be discharged, and a new jury then or afterwards empaneled.

§ 778. In charging the jury, the court must state to them all matters of law which it thinks necessary for their information in giving their verdict: and if it present the facts of the case, it must also inform the jury that they are the exclusive judges of all questions or fact.

§ 779. After hearing the charge, the jury may either decide in court, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they must be kept together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient place, under the charge of one or more officers, until they agree upon their verdict, or are discharged by the court. The officer must, to the utmost of his ability, keep the jury thus together, separate from other persons, without drink except water, and without food, except ordered by the court; he must not suffer any communication to be made to them, not make any himself, unless by order of the court, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, and he must not, before the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations or the verdict agreed on.

§ 780. If, while the jury are kept together, either during the progress of the trial or after their retirement for deliberation, the court order them to be provided with suitable and sufficient food and lodging, they must be so provided by the sheriff, at the expense of the county, or if the trial be in a city court, at the expense of the city.

§ 781. Upon retiring for deliberation, the jury may take with them all papers, (except depositions,) which have been received as evidence in the cause, or copies of such parts of public records or private documents, given in, evidence, as ought not, in the opinion of the court, to be taken from the person having them in possession; and they may also take with them notes of the testimony or other proceedings on the trial, taken by themselves or any of them, but none taken by any other person.

§ 782. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if they desire to be informed of any point of law arising in the cause, they may require the officer to conduct them into court. Upon their being brought into court, the information required must be given, in the presence of; or after notice to the parties or counsel.

§ 783. Except as provided in sections 777 and 786, or in case of some accident or calamity, requiring their discharge, the jury cannot be discharged after the cause is submitted to them, until they have agreed upon their verdict, and rendered it in open court, unless by the consent of both parties entered upon the minutes, or unless at the expiration of such time as the court deem proper, it satisfactorily appear, that there is no probability of an agreement.

§ 784. In all cases where a jury are discharged, or prevented from giving a verdict, by reason of accident or other cause, during the progress of the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, the action may be again tried, immediately, or at a future time, as the court directs.

§ 785. While the jury are absent, the court may adjourn from time to time, in respect to other business; but it is nevertheless to be deemed open, for every purpose connected with the cause submitted to the jury, until a verdict is rendered or the jury discharged. A final adjournment of the court discharges the jury.

§ 786. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict, they must be conducted into court by the officer having them in charge. Their names must then be called; and if all do not appear, the rest must be discharged without giving a verdict.

§ 787. If the jury appear, they must be asked by the court or the clerk, whether they have agreed upon their verdict; and if the foreman answer in the affirmative, they must, on being required, declare the same.

§ 788. When a verdict is rendered, and before it is recorded, the jury may be polled on the request of either party; for which purpose each juror must be asked whether it be his verdict; if any one answer in the negative, the jury must be sent out for further deliberation. If the verdict be informal or insufficient, it may be corrected by the jury under the advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.

§ 789. When the verdict is given, and is such as the court may receive, the clerk must immediately record it in full in the minutes, and must read it to the jury and inquire of them whether it be their verdict. If any juror disagree, the fact must be entered in the minutes, and the jury again sent out; but if no disagreement be expressed, the verdict is complete, and the jury must be discharged from the case.

Special verdict controls general.

§ 790. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. A general verdict, is that by which they pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the court. It must present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them, and those conclusions of fact must be so presented, as that nothing remains to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.

§ 791. In every action for the recovery of money only, or specific real property, the jury in their discretion, may render a general or special verdict. In all other cases, the court may direct the jury to find a special verdict in writing, upon all or any of the issues; and in all cases may instruct them if they render a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The special verdict or finding must be filed with the clerk and entered upon the minutes.

§ 792. Where a special finding of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and the court must give judgment accordingly.

§ 793. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff, in an action for the recovery of money, or for the defendant, when a counter claim for the recovery of money is established, beyond the amount of the plaintiff's claim as established, the jury must also assess the amount of the recovery.

§ 794. In an action for the recovery of specific personal property, if the property have not been delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury must, if their verdict be in favor of the plaintiff, or if being in favor of the defendant, they also find that he is entitled to a return thereof; must assess the value of the property, and may at the same time assess the damages, if any are claimed in the complaint or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason of the taking or detention of such property.

§ 795. Upon receiving a verdict, an entry must be made, in the minutes of the court, specifying the time and place of the trial, the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and either the judgment to be rendered thereon, or when the court is in doubt what judgment ought to be given, it may order that the case be reserved for argument or further consideration.

§ 797. Upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, its decision must be given in writing, and filed with the clerk, with twenty days after the circuit or term at which the trial took place. In giving the decision, the facts found, and the conclusions of law, must be separately stated. Judgment upon the decision must be entered accordingly.

§ 798. On a judgment for the plaintiff upon an issue of law, the plaintiff may proceed in the manner prescribed by the first two subdivisions of section 755, upon the failure of the defendant to answer, where the summons was personally served. If judgment be for the defendant, upon an issue of law, and the taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary to enable the court to complete the judgment, a reference may be ordered, as in that section provided.

CHAPTER VI. TRIAL BY REFEREES.

Trial by referees.
Judgment to be entered on report of referees.

§ 799. A trial by referees is conducted in the same manner as a trial by the court.

§ 800. The report of the referees upon the whole issue stands as the decision of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner, as if the action had been tried by the court; and their decision may be excepted to and reviewed in like manner. When the reference is to report the facts, the report has the effect of a special verdict.

§ 814. When the case is reserved for argument or further consideration, as mentioned in the last section, on the ground that judgment ought not to be given in conformity to the verdict, or that it is doubtful what judgment should be given, the questions reserved may be decided by the court, and judgment thereupon rendered without further argument, or if not so decided they may be brought before the court for judgment, at a special term, upon notice; and judgment thereupon rendered.

§ 815. If a counter claim, established at the trial, exceed the plaintiff’s demand so established, judgment for the defendant must be given for the excess, or if it appear that the defendant is entitled to any other affirmative relief, judgment must be given accordingly.

§ 816. In an action to recover the possession of personal property, judgment for the plaintiff may be for the possession, or the value, thereof, in case a delivery cannot be had, and of damages for the detention. If the property have been delivered to the plaintiff, and the defendant claim a return thereof, judgment for the defendant may be for a return of the property, or the value thereof, in case a return cannot be had, and damages for taking and withholding the same.

§ 817. Judgment upon an issue of law, or of fact, or upon confession, or upon failure to answer, (except where the clerk is authorized to enter the same by the first subdivision of section 755,) must, in the first instance, be entered upon the direction of a single judge, or the report of referees upon the whole issue, subject to review at the general term, on the demand of either party, as provided in this code.

§ 818. The clerk must keep among the records of the court, a book for the entry of judgments, to be called the “judgment book.”

§ 819. The judgment must be entered in the judgment book, and must specify clearly the relief granted, or other determination of the action.

§ 820. If a party die after a verdict or decision upon an issue of fact, and before judgment, the court may nevertheless render judgment thereon. Such judgment is not a lien on the real property of the deceased party, but is payable in the course of administration on his estate.

§ 821. Immediately after entering the judgment, the clerk must attach together and file the following papers, which constitute the judgment roll: 1. In case the complaint be not answered by any defendant, the summons and complaint, or copies thereof, proof of service, and that no answer has been received, the report, if any, and a copy of the judgment. 2. In all other cases, the summons, pleadings, or copies thereof, and a copy of the judgment with any verdict or report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions, and all orders relating to a change of parties, or in any way involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judgment. If a statement of the case be made, the same may be attached to the judgment roll, on the request of either party, and thenceforth forms a part thereof. When the defendant is entitled to judgment, if the plaintiff shall not have filed the summons, with proof of service and the pleadings on his part, the copies of summons and pleadings served on the defendant, may be substituted therefore in making the judgment roll, or the plaintiff may, at the instance of the defendant, be ordered by a judge forthwith to file such papers. Upon an exemplification of a judgment, as evidence only that part of the roll which consists of the summons, pleadings, and judgment need be given.

§ 822. On filing a judgment roll, upon a judgment requiring the payment of money, the judgment may be docketed with the clerk of the county where it was rendered, and in any other county, upon filing with the clerk thereof a transcript of the original docket; and thereupon the judgment becomes a lien on real property in the county, from the time of docketing it therein.

§ 823. The lien, mentioned in the last section, extends to all the real property of the judgment debtor in the county, owned by him at the time of the judgment, or afterwards acquired, and continues till the first day of July, 1860, on all unsatisfied judgments rendered or which may be rendered before that time. But after the first day of January, 1860, there can be no such lien.

§ 824. The docket mentioned in section 822 is a book, which the clerk must keep in his office, and in which he must enter alphabetically, under the name of the person, 1. The names of the parties to the judgment: 2. The amount of the judgment: and 3. The precise time of his entry.

§ 825. Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered in the clerk’s register and docket, upon an execution returned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment of satisfaction filed with the clerk, made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property, by the judgment creditor, or within two years after the judgment, by the attorney, unless a revocation of his authority is previously entered upon the register. Whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact, otherwise than upon an execution, it is the duty of the party or attorney to give such acknowledgment, and upon motion, the court may compel it, or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it. And whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact as to any one of several defendants, an entry to that effect may be made in the register and docket.

§ 827. There are three kinds of writs of execution; one against the property of the judgment debtor; another against his person; and the third for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, or such delivery with damages for withholding the same. They are issued in the name of the people and are deemed the process of the court, but they need not be sealed nor subscribed, except as prescribed in the next section.

§ 828. The writ of execution must be directed to the sheriff, subscribed by the party issuing it, or his attorney, and must intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county where the judgment roll or transcript is filed, the names of the parties, the amount of the judgment, if it be for money, the amount actually due thereon, and the time of docketing in the county to which the execution is issued, and must require the sheriff substantially as follows: 1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, out of his real property, or if the judgment be a lien on real property, then out of the real property belonging to him on the day when the judgment was docketed in the county, or at any time thereafter, or if the judgment be entered pursuant to the first subdivision of section 632, the execution must conform to such judgment: 2. If it be against real or personal property, in the hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real property, or trustees, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of such property: 3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to arrest such debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county, until he pay the judgment, with interest, or be discharged according to law: 4. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it must require the sheriff to deliver the possession of the same, particularly describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require the sheriff to satisfy any costs, charges, damages, rents or profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it was rendered, and the value of the property for which the judgment was recovered, to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of real property, as provided in the first subdivision of this section, and in that respect it is to be deemed an execution against property.

§ 829. The execution must be made returnable within sixty days after its receipt by the sheriff, to the clerk with whom the judgment roll is filed.

§ 830. Where a judgment requires the payment of money or the delivery of real or personal property, the same is enforced in those respects by execution, as provided in the last three sections. Where it requires the performance of any other act, a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the party against whom it is given, or upon the person or officer who is required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and his obedience thereto enforced. If he refuse, he may be punished by the court, as for a contempt.

§ 831. After the lapse of five years from the entry of judgment, if no execution have been already issued, an execution can be issued only by leave of the court on motion, upon notice to the adverse party. Such leave must not be given unless it be established by the oath of the party, or other proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, remains unsatisfied and due. When the judgment has been rendered in a justice’s court, and docketed in the office of the clerk of the county, the application for leave to issue execution must be to the county court of the county where the judgment was rendered, or in the city and county of New-York, to the court of common pleas of that city, and such court has jurisdiction over the judgment and execution.

§ 832. Notwithstanding the death of a party after judgment, execution thereon against his property may be issued and executed in the same manner and with the same effect, as if he were still living, except that such execution cannot be issued within a year after his death, unless upon permission granted by the surrogate.

§ 833. Where the execution is against the property of the judgment debtor, it may be issued to the sheriff of any county where the judgment is docketed. Where it requires the delivery of real or personal property, it must be issued to the sheriff of the county where the property or some part thereof, is situated. Executions may be issued, at the same time, to different counties.

§ 834. If the action be one in which the defendant might have been arrested, as provided in the first three subdivisions of section 675, an execution against the person of the judgment debtor may be issued to any county within the jurisdiction of the court, after the return of an execution against his property, unsatisfied in whole or in part. An execution against the person may likewise be issued, after such return, in the cases mentioned in the fourth and fifth subdivisions of that section, where the defendant has been provisionally arrested in the action, and the order for his arrest has not been vacated, or upon an order of arrest obtained in the same manner as for a provisional arrest.

§ 835. A person arrested on execution must be imprisoned within the jail, or the liberties thereof, and there kept at his own expense, until satisfaction of the execution, or his legal discharge.

§ 836. When a defendant has been once imprisoned upon execution, no other execution can issue upon the same judgment, unless he escape or die, while charged in execution, or unless he be discharged without the consent of the judgment creditor.

§ 837. All property liable to an attachment is liable to execution. It must be levied on, in the same manner as similar property is attached, pursuant to section 729. Until a levy, property is not affected by the execution.

§ 838. If the property levied on be claimed by a third person as his property, the sheriff may summon from his county any twelve persons, qualified as jurors between the parties, to try the validity of the claim. They and the witnesses must be sworn by the sheriff, and if their verdict be in favor of the claimant, the sheriff may relinquish the levy, unless the judgment creditor give him a sufficient indemnity for proceeding thereon. The fees of the jury must be paid by the claimant, if the verdict be against him, otherwise by the plaintiff.

§ 839. The following property owned by a householder, and in actual use, or kept for use by and for his family, or when being removed from one habitation to another upon a change of residence, is exempt from execution, except as herein otherwise specially provided: 1.

Necessary household, table and kitchen furniture, including stoves, stove pipe, and stove furniture, wearing apparel, beds, bedding and bedsteads, provisions actually provided for family use, sufficient for six months, including meat, fish, vegetables, flour and meal, with fuel for sixty: days, one cow, ten sheep, two swine, and food for them for three months: 3.

A horse, harness, and cart or other vehicle, by the use of which a physician, constable, cartman, teamster, or other laborer, habitually earns his living. But the aggregate value of all the property to exempt, cannot exceed two hundred and fifty dollars; nor is any article exempt from an execution issued on a judgment for its price.

§ 840. The sheriff must execute the writ against the property of the judgment debtor, by levying on the property, collecting the things in action, as prescribed by section 731 and the fourth subdivision of section 736, selling the other property, and paying to the plaintiff the proceeds, or so much thereof as will satisfy the execution.

§ 841. Before the sale of property on execution, notice thereof must be given as follows: 1. In case of personal property, by posting written notice of the time and place of sale, in three public places of the town where the sale is to take place, six days successively: 2. In case of real property, by posting a similar notice describing the property with the certainty prescribed by section 656, for six weeks successively, in three public places of the town where the property is situated, and also where the property is to be sold, and publishing a copy thereof once a week for the same period, in a newspaper of the county, if there be one, or if there be none, and the property is not occupied by the judgment debtor, or by a tenant or purchaser under him, then in the state paper. After the first of July, 1860, such notice shall be a lien upon the property until the sale thereof, and the tiling the certificate of the sale with the clerk of the county.

§ 842. A officer selling without the notice prescribed by the last section, shall forfeit one hundred dollars to the aggrieved party, in addition to his actual damages, and a person, taking down or defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale or the satisfaction of the execution, and without the consent of the parties, shall forfeit fifty dollars; but the validity of the sale is not affected by either act.

§ 843. A sale must be made by auction, between nine o’clock in the morning and sunset; after sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more must be sold; neither the officer holding the execution nor his deputy can purchase; when the sale is of personal property, capable of manual delivery, it must be within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold in such places as are likely to bring the highest price; and when the sale is of real property, and consisting of several known lots, or parcels, they must be sold separately, or when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion must be thus sold.

§ 844. Upon a sale of real property, where the estate is less than a leasehold of two years unexpired term, the sale is absolute. In all other cases the property sold is subject to redemption as provided in the next five sections; the officer must give to the purchaser a certificate of the sale, proved or acknowledged so that it may be recorded, containing, 1. A particular description of the property sold: 2. The price bid for each distinct lot or parcel: 3. The whole price paid: 4. When subject to redemption, it must be so stated, a duplicate of which certificate must be filed by the officer with the clerk of the county.

§ 845. Property sold subject to redemption, as provided in the last section; or any part sold separately; may be redeemed; in the manner provided in the next four sections, by the following persons or their successors in interest: 1. The judgment debtor, or his successor in interest; in the whole or any part of the property. 2. A creditor, having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the property sold, or on some share or part thereof, subsequent to that on which the property was sold. The persons mentioned in the last four subdivisions, are in this chapter termed redemptions.

§ 846. The judgment debtor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser within sixty days after the sale, on paying him the amount of his purchase, and if he be also a creditor having a lien prior to that of the redemptioner, the amount of such lien, with interest.

§ 847. If the property be so redeemed, by a redemptioner, either the judgment debtor or another redemptioner, may within thirty days after the last redemption, again redeem it from the last redemptioner on paying the sum paid on his redemption, with interest, and, unless his lien be prior to that of the proceeding redemptioner, the amount of such lien, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as the debtor or owner, or any redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any redemptioner within thirty days after his redemption, and notice thereof filed with the sheriff. If no redemption is made in sixty days after the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a conveyance; or if so redeemed, whenever thirty days have elapsed, and no redemption has been made and notified therein, the time for redemption has expired, and the last redemptioner is entitled to a sheriff’s deed. If the debtor or owner redeem at any time before the time for redemption expires, the effects of the sale are terminated, and he is restored to his estate.

§ 848. The payment mentioned in the last two sections, may be made to the purchaser or redemptioner, as the case may be, or for him, to the officer who made the sale; and a tender of the money is equivalent to payment.

§ 849. A redemptioner must produce to the officer or person from whom he seeks to redeem, and file with his notice in the sheriff’s office. 1. A copy of the docket of the judgment, under which he claims the right to redeem, certified by the clerk of the court or of the county, where the judgment is docketed, or if he redeem upon a mortgage or other lien, a note of the record thereof, certified by the clerk: 2. A copy of any assignment necessary to establish his claim, verified by the affidavit of himself or of a subscribing witness thereto: and 3. An affidavit by himself or his agent showing the amount then actually due on the lien.

§ 850. Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, the court may restrain the commission of waste on the property by order granted with or without notice, on the application of the purchaser or the judgment creditor. But it is not waste for the person in possession of the property at the time of sale, or entitled to possession afterwards during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in the same manner in which it was previously used, or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry, or to make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon, or to use wood or timber on the property therefore, or for the repair of fences, or for fuel in his family, while he occupies the property.

§ 851. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the judgment, he may recover the price paid with interest from the judgment creditor. Such judgment creditor, if the recovery was in consequence of the irregularity, shall thereupon be entitled to a new execution on the judgment, for the price paid on the sale with interest; and for that purpose the judgment shall be deemed valid against the judgment debtor, his personal representatives, heirs, or devisees, but not against a purchaser in good faith, or an encumbrancer, whose title  or encumbrance shall have accrued before a levy on such new execution.

§ 852. When property, liable to an execution against several persons, is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is levied upon the property of one of them, or one of them pays without a sale more than his proportion, he may compel contribution from the others. And when a judgment is against several, and is upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays the amount or any part thereof, either by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. In such eases the person so paying, or contributing, is entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment, if within ten days after his payment he file with the clerk of the court, where the judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to contribution or repayment. Upon the filing of such notice, the clerk must make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket.

§ 854. After the issuing of an execution against property, and upon proof by affidavit; of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, or a judge thereof; or county judge, that any judgment debtor has property, which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place, to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had, for the application of the property of the judgment debtor towards the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided, upon the return of an execution.

§ 855. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sections, the judge may, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise, to his satisfaction that there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the state, or concealing himself, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be examined on oath, and ordered to enter into an undertaking with one or more sureties, that he will attend from time to time before the judge or referee, as he shall direct, during the pendency of the proceeding, and until the final determination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of his property, not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison, by warrant of the judge.

§ 856. After the issuing of execution against property, any person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execution and the sheriff’s receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid.

§ 857. After the issuing or return of an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment, and upon proof by affidavit, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the judge, that any person or corporation, has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, the judge may by an order require such person or corporation, or any officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place, and answer concerning the same. The judge may also, in his discretion, require notice of such proceeding to be given to any party to the action, in such manner as may seem to him proper.

§ 858: Witnesses may be required to appear and testify upon any proceeding under this chapter, in the same manner as upon the trial of an issue.

§ 859. The party or witness may be required to attend before the judge, or before a referee, appointed by the court or judge. If before a referee, the examination must be taken by the referee, and certified to the judge. All examinations and answers before a judge or referee, under this chapter, must be on oath, except that when a corporation answers, the answer must be on the oath of an officer thereof.

§ 860. The judge may order any property of the Judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment, except that the earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within thirty days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied, when it is made to appear by the debtor’s affidavit, or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.

§ 861. The judge may also, by order, appoint a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner and with the like authority, as if the appointment were made by the court. The judge may also, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, and any interference therewith.

§ 862. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property, adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or debt is recoverable only in an action against such person or corporation, by the receiver: but the judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest, till a sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. Such order may be modified or vacated, by the judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he may direct.

§ 863. The judge may, in his discretion, order a reference to a referee agreed upon or appointed by him, to report the evidence or the facts.

§ 864. The judge may allow to the judgment creditor, or to any person so examined, whether a party to the action or not, his charges, and a fixed sum in addition, not exceeding ten dollars, as costs.

§ 865. If any person, party or witness, disobey an order of the judge or referee, duly served, such person, party or witness, may be punished by the judge, as for a contempt. The proceedings therefore are prescribed in the title of the third part of this code, respecting the punishment of contempts.

Such value must be determined by the jury, court or referee, by whom the action is tried.

§ 868. When several actions are brought on one bond, undertaking, promissory note, bill of exchange, or other instrument in writing, or in any other case for the same cause of action, against several parties who might have been joined as defendants in the same action, no costs can be allowed to the plaintiff, in more than one of such actions, which may be at his election, if the parties proceeded against in the other actions were at the commencement of the previous action, openly within this state; but the disbursements of the plaintiff may be allowed to him, as provided in section 874.

§ 869. Costs are allowed of course to the defendant, upon a judgment in his favor, in an action for the recovery of money, where the plaintiff recovers less than fifty dollars, and also in the other actions mentioned in section 867.

§ 870. In other actions, costs may be allowed or not, and if allowed, may be apportioned between the parties, on the same or adverse sides, in the discretion of the court. When there are several defendants, not united in interest, and making separate defenses by separate answers, and the plaintiff fails to recover judgment against all, the court may award costs to such of the defendants as have judgment in their favor, or any of them. And in the following cases the costs of an appeal are in the discretion of the court; 1. Where a new trial is ordered: 2. Where a judgment is modified.

§ 871. Costs can not be allowed to the plaintiff, in an action upon a judgment of a court of this state, between the same parties, unless such action was brought with previous leave of the court for cause shown; but this prohibition does not apply to an action upon the judgment of a justice’s court, brought in another county, or brought in the same county, in case of the summons not having been served on all the defendants, or the death of a party, or the death, resignation, incapacity to act or removal from the county of the justice, or the loss of his docket.

But such allowance can in no case exceed two hundred dollars.

§ 873. When the judgment is for the recovery of money, interest from the time of the verdict or report, until judgment be finally entered, must be computed by the clerk, and added thereto.

§ 874. The clerk must insert in the entry of judgment on the application of the prevailing party, upon two days notice to the other, the sum of the allowances for costs, as above provided, and the necessary disbursements, including the fees of officers allowed by law, the fees of witnesses, the necessary expenses of commissions, the compensation of referees, and the expense of printing the papers upon any appeal, which disbursements are in this code also termed charges. The disbursements must be stated in detail, and verified by affidavit, which must be filed. Whenever costs are allowed by this code, the charges also are allowed, and when costs are not allowed, the charges are not allowed, except where express provision is made therefore.

§ 875. The clerk may receiver, On every trial, from the party bringing it on, one dollar: On entering judgment, fifty cents except in courts where the clerks receive salaries, and in such courts one dollar: On docketing a judgment rendered by a justice in his county, and filing a transcript thereof, twenty-five cents, including execution when issued. He can receive no other fee, for any services whatever in a civil action, except for copies of papers, at the rate of five cents for every hundred words.

§ 876. The fees of referees are three dollars to each, for every day spent in the business of the reference; but the parties may agree in writing upon any other rate of compensation and thereupon such rate must be allowed.

§ 877. When an application is made to a court or referees, to postpone a trial, the payment to the adverse party of a sum not exceeding ten dollars, besides the fees of witnesses, may be imposed, as the condition of granting the postponement.

§ 878. Costs may be allowed on an original motion, or on an appeal from an order, in the discretion of the court, not exceeding ten dollars. And when costs are ordered against a party, upon a motion, proceedings on his part may be stayed until payment thereof.

§ 879. When costs are adjudged against an infant plaintiff, the guardian, by whom he appeared in the action is responsible for them, and judgment therefore may be entered, against both the guardian and infant.

§ 880. When, in an action for the recovery of money only, the defendant alleges in his answer, that, before the commencement of the action, he tendered to the plaintiff, the full amount to which he was entitled, and thereupon deposits in court for the plaintiff, the amount so tendered, and the allegation be found true, the plaintiff cannot recover costs, but must pay costs to the defendant.

§ 881. In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor, administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, costs may be recovered as in an action by and against a person prosecuting or defending in his own right, but such costs must by the judgment be made chargeable only upon the estate, fund, or party represented, unless the court direct the same to be paid by the plaintiff or defendant, personally, for mismanagement or bad faith in the action or defense. But no costs are recoverable in such action, if brought without leave of the surrogate, against an executor or administrator within one year after the death of the person whom he represents, not after that time, unless it appear that the demand was first presented to the executor or administrator, verified by oath, and payment demanded.

§ 882. When the decision of a court of inferior jurisdiction in a special proceeding, is brought before the supreme court for review, such proceeding is for all purposes of costs, to be deemed an action at issue, on a question of law, from the time the same is brought into the, supreme court, costs thereon, may be awarded and collected in web; manner as the court may direct: according to the nature of the case.

§ 883. In all civil actions prosecuted in the name of the people of this state, by an officer duly authorized for that purpose, the people are liable for costs in the same cases, and to the same extent, as private parties. If a private person be joined with the people as plaintiff, he is liable tin the first instance for the defendant’s costs; which cannot be recovered of the people, till, after execution issued therefore against such private party and returned unsatisfied. And when costs are awarded, and recoverable against the people, payment, thereof must be made by the comptroller, upon the production of proper evidence thereof.

§ 884. In an action prosecuted in the name of the people of this state for the recovery of money or property, or to establish a right or claim, for the benefit of any county, city, town, village, corporation or person, costs awarded against the plaintiff, must by the judgment be made a charge against the party for whose benefit the action was prosecuted, and not against the people.

§ 885. In an action in which the cause of action, after the commencement of the action, by assignment, or in any other manner, becomes the property of a person not a party to the action, and the prosecution or defense is thereafter continued, such person is liable for the costs, in the same manner as if he were a party, and payment thereof may be enforced by order.

§ 886. Upon the settlement, before judgment, of any action mentioned in section 867, no greater sum can be demanded from the defendant as costs, than at the rates prescribed by section 872.

§ 887. The attorney of a plaintiff, who resides out of the state, or is a foreign corporation, against whom costs are awarded to a defendant, is responsible to, such defendant therefore, to an amount not exceeding two hundred dollars. And the attorney neglecting to pay the same, after due proceedings against him, may be removed by the court. But he may relieve himself from responsibility, at any time before judgment, by filing an undertaking, for the payment to the defendant of the costs and charges, executed by a sufficient surety.

In an action for the foreclosure or satisfaction of a mortgage of real property, or the satisfaction of a lien or encumbrance upon property, real or personal the court has power, by its judgment, to direct a sale of the property, or any part of it; the application of the proceeds to the payment of the amount due on the mortgage, lien, or encumbrance with costs; and execution, for the balance, against any party liable therefore, as principal, surety, or otherwise.

§ 904. Real property adjudged to be sold, must be sold in the county where it lies, by the sheriff of the county, or by a referee, appointed by the court for that purpose, and thereupon the sheriff or referee must execute a conveyance to the purchaser, which conveyance passes the title of the parties to the action. And upon the sale of property, real or personal, pursuant to a judgment, the court may enforce the delivery of possession thereof to the purchaser.

§ 905. When a debt is secured by mortgage of real or personal property, or a lien or encumbrance thereon, separate actions respecting the debt and the security cannot be allowed, but the creditor must include in one action all his claims upon both.

§ 906. If there be surplus money, remaining after payment of the amount mentioned in section 903, the court may cause the same to be paid to the person entitled to it, and in the mean time, may direct it to be deposited in court.

§ 907. If the debt, for which the mortgage, lien or encumbrance is held, be not all due, so soon as sufficient of the property has been sold to pay the amount due, with costs the sale must cease; and afterwards as often as more becomes due, for principal or interest, the court may, on motion, order more to be sold. But if the property cannot be sold in portions, without injury to the parties, the whole may be ordered to be sold in the first instance, and the entire debt and costs be paid, there being a rebate of interest, where such rebate is proper.

Such action may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance; and by the judgment, the nuisance may be enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered.

§ 909. If a guardian, tenant by the curtesy, in dower, for life or years, joint tenant or tenant in common of real property, commit waste thereon, any person aggrieved by the waste, may bring an action against him therefore, in which action, there may be judgment for treble damages, forfeiture of the estate of the party offending, and eviction from the property.

§ 910. Judgment of forfeiture and eviction can only be given, in favor of the person entitled to the reversion, against the tenant in possession, when the injury to the estate in reversion is adjudged in the action, to be equal to the value of the tenant’s estate or unexpired term, or to have been done in malice.

§ 911. Every person who cuts down, or carries off any wood or underwood, tree or timber, or girdles or otherwise injures any tree, timber or shrub on the land of another person, or on the street or highway, in front of any person’s house, village or city lot, or cultivated grounds, or on the commons, or public grounds, of any city or town, or on the street or highway, in front thereof, without lawful authority, is liable to the owner of such land, or to such city or town, for treble the amount of damages, which may be assessed therefore, in a civil action, in any court having jurisdiction, except as provided in the next section.

§ 912. If upon the trial of such action, it appear, that the trespass was casual or involuntary, or that the defendant had probable cause to believe, that the land, on which the trespass was committed, was his own, or that of the person in whose service, or by whose direction, the act was done, judgment must be given for only the single damages assessed in the action.

§ 913. Nothing in the last two sections authorizes the recovery of more than the just value of the timber, taken from uncultivated wood land, for the repair of a public highway or bridge upon the land or adjoining it.

§ 914. If a person be put out of real property in a forcible manner, without lawful authority, or, being so put out, be afterwards kept out by force, recover damages therefore, judgment may be entered for three times the amount at which the actual damages are assessed.

§ 915.

§ 916. For trespass, by any person other than an Indian, on lands possessed by Indians, an action may be brought in the name of the people of this state.

§ 917. Such action must be prosecuted by the district attorney of the county where the lands are situated, or by an attorney to be designated for that purpose, by the county judge.

§ 921. The summons must be addressed by name to all the joint tenants, and tenants in common, who are known, and generally to all persons unknown, having or claiming an interest in the property.

§ 922. The interests of all persons in the property, whether such persons be known or unknown, must be set forth in the complaint specifically and particularly, as far as known to the plaintiff, and if any one or more of the parties, or the share or quantity of interest of any of the parties, be unknown to the plaintiff, or be uncertain or contingent, or the ownership of the inheritance depend upon executory devise, or the remainder be a contingent remainder, so that such parties can not be named, that fact must be set forth in the complaint.

§ 923. The plaintiff may at his option, make creditors, having a specific or general lien upon the property or upon any particular portion thereof, parties to the action.

§ 924. When the lien is on an undivided interest or estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition made, is thenceforth a charge only on the share assigned to such party; but such share must be first charged with its just proportion of the costs of the partition, in preference to such lien.

§ 925. If a party having a share or interest unknown, or either of the known parties reside out of the state or cannot be found therein, and such fact be made to appear by affidavit, the summons may be served on such absent or unknown party, by publication, directed by the court or judge, in the manner prescribed by sections 629 and 630. When publication is made, the summons, as published, must be accompanied by a brief description of the property, which is the subject of the action.

§ 926. The rights of the several parties, plaintiffs, as well as defendants, may be put in issue, tried and determined by such action; and where a defendant fails to answer, or where a sale of the premises is necessary, the title must be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction of the court, before the judgment for partition or sale is given.

§ 927. If it be alleged in the complaint, and established by evidence, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property or any part of it is so situated, that partition cannot be made, without great prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof, and for that purpose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a partition, according to the respective rights of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint three referees therefore; and must designate the portion to remain undivided, for the owners, whose interests remain unknown or not ascertained.

§ 928. In making the partition, referees must divide the property, and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights of the parties, as determined by the court, designating the several portions by proper landmarks, and may employ an surveyor, with the necessary assistants, to aid them therein.

§ 929. The referees must make report of their proceedings, specifying therein the manner of executing their trust, describing the property divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with a particular description of each share.

§ 930. The court may confirm or set aside the report, and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon the report being confirmed, judgment must be rendered, that such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is binding and conclusive: 1. On all the parties named therein, and their legal representatives, who have at the time any interest in the property divided, as owners in fee, or as tenants for years, or as entitled to the reversion, remainder or inheritance of such property, after the termination of a particular estate therein: or who, by any contingency, may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who have an interest in-an individual share thereof; as tenants for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower: 2. On all persons interested in the property, who may be unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of the application for partition by the publication directed, by section 925: and, 3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons, or either of them.

§ 931. But such judgment and partition cannot affect tenants, or persons having claims as tenants, in dower, by the curtesy or for life, to the whole of the property, which is the subject of the partition; nor can such judgment and partition preclude any person, except such as are specified in the last section, from claiming, title to the property in question, or from controverting, the title of the parties between whom the partition is made.

§ 932. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor and his assistants, when employed must be ascertained and allowed by the court; and the amount thereof together with the fees allowed by law to the referees, must be paid by the plaintiff, and may be allowed as part of the charges.

§ 933. If the referees report to the court, that the property, of which partition shall have been directed, or any distinct portion thereof, is so situated, that a partition thereof cannot be made, without great prejudice to the owners; and the court is satisfied that such report is correct, it may thereupon, by an order, direct the referees to sell the property, or portion so situated.

§ 934. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold, if there be an estate by the curtesy, in dower, or for life or years, in an undivided share of the property, the whole of such estate may be set off in any part of the property not ordered to be sold.

§ 935. Before the making of an order for sale, where the creditors having specific liens have not been made parties, the court, on the motion of either party, must direct the plaintiff to amend his complaint, if necessary, by making every person having a specific lien on the undivided interest or estate of any of the parties by mortgage, devise or otherwise, a party to the action.

§ 936. The plaintiff must produce to the court the certificate of the clerk of the county where the property is situated, showing whether there are any general liens by judgment upon the property, or any part thereof.

§ 937. Unless it be made to appear to the court by the certificate of the clerk pursuant to the last section, that there are outstanding no general liens on the property, or on any share or parcel thereof, the court must order a reference to ascertain them.

§ 938. If it appear by the certificate that there are outstanding of record such general liens, the court must appoint a referee to ascertain whether such liens have been paid, or if not paid, what amount remains due or secured by them respectively, and the order of priority in which they are entitled to be paid out of the property.

§ 939. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served, at least ten days before the time for appearance, on each person having such general lien, to appear before the referee at a specified time and place, to make proof by his own or otherwise, of the true amount due, or to become due, contingently or absolutely, on his judgment.

§ 940. The referee must receive the evidence, and report, the names of the creditors whose liens are established, the amounts thereof, and their priority respectively, and if such liens are contingent he must specify them. He must attach to his report the proof of service of the notices, and the affidavits and copies of other evidence before him.

§ 941. Any creditor having a lien, and being dissatisfied with the report of the referee, may move the court to correct it, at any time before distribution of the proceeds of sale, on ten days’ notice to the plaintiff and the other persons in whose favor liens are reported, and thereupon the court may correct the report on the evidence reported, or if necessary, may order a new reference of the whole or of any part of the matter. When confirmed, the report is conclusive of the rights of the several creditors on whom notice was served.

§ 942. The proceeds of the sale of the encumbered property, must be applied under the direction of the court, as follows: 1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the action: 2. To pay the costs of the reference: 3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens in their order of priority, by payment of the sums due and to become due, the amount remaining due to be verified by affidavit at the time of payment: 4. The residue, among the owners of the property sold, according to their respective shares therein.

§ 943. The proceedings to ascertain the amount of encumbrances, and to determine their priority as above provided, or those herein authorized to determine the rights of parties, to funds paid into court, must not delay the sale, not affect any other party, whose rights are not involved in such proceedings.

§ 944. The proceeds of sale, and the securities taken by the referees, or any part thereof, may be distributed by them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the court so directs. But in case no direction be given, all such proceeds and securities must be paid into court, or deposited as required by law, or directed by the court.

§ 945. When the proceeds of: sales of any shares or parcels, belonging to persons, who have become parties to the action, and who are known, are paid into court, the action may be continued as between such parties, for the determination of their respective claims thereto, which must be ascertained and-adjudged by the court. Further testimony may be taken, in court, or by a referee, at the discretion of the court, and the court may, if necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by pleadings, as in an original action.

§ 946. All sales of real property, made by referees under this chapter, must be made by public auction to the highest bidder, upon notice, published in the manner required for the sale of real property on execution. The notice must state the terms of sale, and if the property or any part of it is to be sold, subject to a prior estate, charge or specific lien, that must be stated in the notice.

§ 947. The court must, in the order for sale, direct the terms of credit which may be allowed, for the purchase money, of any portion of the premises of which it may direct a sale on credit, and for that portion of which the purchase money is required, by the provisions hereinafter contained, to be invested for the benefit of unknown owners, infants, parties out of the state, or tenants in dower, or by the curtesy, or for life or years, when the estate of such tenants is ordered to be sold.

§ 948. The referees may take separate mortgages and other securities, for the whole or convenient portions of the purchase money, or such parts of the property as are directed by the court to be sold on credit in the name of the clerk of the court and his successors in office, and for the shares of any known owner of full age, in the name of such owner.

§ 949. When the estate of a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy, or for life or years, in the whole or any part of the property in question has been admitted by the parties, or ascertained by the court, to be existing at the time of the order for sale, and the person entitled to such estate, has been made a party to the action, such estate may be first set off out of any part of the property, and a sale make of such parcel, subject to the prior unsold estate of such tenant therein, But if in the judgment of the court, a due regard to the interests of all the parties, require that such estate be also sold the sale may be so ordered.

§ 950. If a sale of the property, including such estate, be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or person passes thereby; and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall hold the property discharged from all claims, by virtue of such estate or interest, whether the same be to the individual share of a joint tenant, or tenant in common, or to the whole or any part of the property sold.

§ 951. The persons entitled to such estate in dower, tenancy by the curtesy, or tenancy for life or years, whose estate shall have been sold, are entitled to receive such sum in gross, as may be deemed upon principles of law applicable to annuities, a reasonable satisfaction for such estate, and which the person so entitled may consent to accept instead thereof; by an instrument under seal, duly acknowledged or proved, in in same manner as deeds for the purpose of record.

§ 952. If such consent be not given, at or before the report of sale, the court must ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds of the sale, after deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to be invested, for the benefit of the person entitled to such estate, in dower, by the curtesy, or for life; and must order the same to be deposited in court for that purpose.

§ 953. The proportion of the proceeds of the sale to be invested, must be ascertained and determined in the several cases as follows: 1. If an estate in dower be included in the order of sale, its proportion must be one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the property, or of the sale of the individual share in such property, upon which the claim of dower existed: 2. If an estate by the curtesy, or other estate for life or years, be included in the order of sale, its proportion must be the whole proceeds of the sale of the property, or of the sale of the undivided share thereof, in which such estate may be: And in all cases, the proportion of the expenses of proceedings must be deducted, from the proceeds of the sale.

§ 954. If the persons entitled to such estate in dower by the curtesy, or for life or years, be unknown, the court must provide for the protection of their rights in the same manner, as far as may be, as if they were known and had appeared.

§ 955. In all cases of sales in partition, when it appears that a married woman has an inchoate right of dower in any of the property divided or sold, or that any person has a vested or contingent future right or estate therein, the court must ascertain and settle the proportional value of such inchoate, contingent or vested right .or estate, according to the principles of law applicable to annuities and survivorships, and must direct such proportion of the proceeds of the sale to be invested, secured, or paid over in such manner, as to protect the rights and interests of the parties.

§ 956. A married woman may release such right, interest or estate, to her husband, and acknowledge the same in the manner required by law, in respect to the acknowledgment of deeds by married women, before any officer authorized to take acknowledgment of deeds, or if executed out of this state, before any officer residing in the state, district or county, where the acknowledgment is made, who is "authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds, to be recorded in this state. Upon the release, the share of the proceeds of the sale, arising from her contingent interest, must be paid to her husband, and the release, or the payment, investment, or otherwise securing of a share of the proceeds of a sale, shall be a bar against such right, estate, or claim.

§ 957. The terms of the sale must be made known at the time; and if the premises consist of distinct farms, or lots, they must be sold separately.

§ 958. Neither of the referees, nor any person for the benefit of either of them, can be interested in the purchase; nor can a guardian of an infant party be interested in the purchase of any real property, being the subject of the action, except for the benefit of the infant. All sales contrary to the provisions of this section are void.

§ 959. After completing the sale, the referees must report the same to the court, with a description of the different parcels of land sold to each purchaser, the name of the purchaser, the price paid or secured, the terms and conditions of the sale, and the securities if any taken. The report must be tiled in the office of the clerk of the county, where the property is situated.

§ 960. If the sale be confirmed by the court, an order must be entered, directing the referees to execute conveyances and take securities pursuant to such sale; which they are hereby authorized to do. Such order may also give directions to them respecting the disposition of the proceeds of the sale.

§ 961. When a party entitled to a share of the property, or an encumbrancer entitled to have his lien paid out of the sale, becomes a purchaser, the referees may take his receipt for so much of the proceeds of the sale as belongs to him, and must also pay over to the plaintiff or his attorney, and take his receipt for, the costs and charges of the action.

§ 962. The conveyances must be recorded in the county, where the premises are situated, and shall be a bar against all persons interested in the property in any way, who shall have been named as parties in the action, and against all such parties and persons as were unknown, if the summons have been served as is directed by section 925, and against all persons claiming from them or either of them.

§ 963. The conveyances shall also be a bar against all persons having specific or general liens or encumbrances by judgment, on any undivided share or interest in the premises sold, who shall have been served with notice as prescribed by section 939; and also against all persons having specific liens on any undivided share or interest therein, who shall have been made parties to the action. But no creditor having such specific lien can be affected by the sale or conveyance unless he has been made party.

§ 964. When there are proceeds of sale, belonging to an unknown owner, or to a person without the state, who has no legal representative within it, or when there are proceeds arising from the sale of an estate, subject to the prior estate of a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy, or tenant for life, or years, which are paid into court, or deposited with an officer by order of the court, the same must be invested in securities on interest, for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto.

§ 965. When security for the proceeds of sale is taken, or when an investment of any such proceeds is made, it must be done, except as herein otherwise provided, in the name of the clerk of the county, where the papers are filed, and his successors in office, who shall hold the same for the use and benefit of the parties interested, subject to the order of the court.

§ 966. When security is taken by the referees on a sale, and the parties interested in such security, by an instrument in writing under their hands, delivered to the referees, agree upon the shares and proportions to which they are respectively entitled, or when such shares and proportions have been previously adjudged by the court, such securities must be taken in the names, of, and payable to, the parties respectively entitled thereto, and must be delivered to such parties upon their receipt therefore. Such agreement, and receipt must be returned and filed with the clerk.

§ 967. The clerk, in whose name a security is taken, or by whom an investment is made, and his successors in office, must receive the interest and principal, as it becomes due, and, apply and invest the same, as the court may direct, and must file in his office all securities taken, and keep an account in a book provided and kept for that purpose in the clerk’s office, free for inspection by all persons of investments, and moneys received by him thereon, and the disposition thereof.

§ 968. When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between the parties, according to, their respective rights, without prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, the court, may adjudge compensation to be made, by one party to another for equality of partition, But such compensation cannot be required to be made to others, by owners unknown nor by infants, unless, in the case of an infant, it appear that he has personal property sufficient for that purpose, and that his interest will be promoted thereby.

§ 969. When the share of an infant is sold, the proceeds of the sale may be paid by the referees making the sale, to his general guardian, or to the special guardian appointed for him in the action, if such general or special guardian, before the payment of such share into court, shall have given the security required by section 550.

§ 970. The committee who may be entitled to the custody and management of the estate of an insane person, or other person adjudged incapable of conducting his own affairs, whose interest in real property shall have been solid, may receive, in behalf of such person, his share of the proceeds of such real property, from the referees, if the committee, before the money is paid into court, shall have executed, with sufficient sureties, an undertaking, approved by a judge of the court, or if the action be in the supreme court, by a county judge, that he will faithfully discharge the trust reposed in him, and will render a true and just account to the person entitled, or to his legal representative.

§ 971. The general guardian of an infant, and the committee entitled to the custody and management of the estate of an insane person, or other person adjudged incapable of conducting his own affairs, who is entitled to real estate held in joint tenancy, or in common, or in any other manner, to authorize his being made party to an action for the partition thereof; may consent to a partition without action, and agree upon the share to be set off to such infant, or other person entitled, and may execute a release in his behalf, to the owners of the shares of the parts to which they may be respectively entitled, upon an order of the court.

§ 972. The people of this state may be made a party to an action, for the sale or partition of real property, in which case the summons and complaint must be served upon the attorney general, who must appear on behalf of the people.

§ 973. The costs of partition, including fees of referees and other disbursements, must be paid by the parties respectively entitled to share in the lands divided, in proportion to their respective interests therein, and may be included and specified in the judgment. In that case, they are a lien on the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced by execution against the parties separately. Where, however, a litigation arises between some of the parties only the court may require, the expense of such litigation to be paid by the parties thereto, or any of them.

§ 975. A foreign corporation cannot maintain an action in this state, upon an obligation or liability, arising out of, or in consideration of an act, which is contrary to the law or policy of this state, or which is thereby forbidden, in respect to corporations or associations therein, whose general business is similar to that of such foreign corporation.

§ 976. When judgment is rendered against a bank, or banking association, for any bill or other contract, for the absolute payment of money, payment of which has been refused, on presentment at the bank, or place of business of the defendant, the plaintiff may recover interest, at the rate of ten percent a year, from the time: of such refusal, unless in the act of incorporation, a different rate of interest, or measure of damages, has been prescribed.

§ 977. A corporation may be restrained by injunction, provisional or final, from, exercising any function or doing any act not allowed by law. Such injunction may be granted upon the application of the attorney general, or other officer authorized by statute, on satisfactory evidence that the corporation has usurped, exercised or claimed a franchise, privilege, or other corporate right, not authorized by law, or has done or suffered some other act, by which its corporate existence or, rights have become forfeited, or may by authority of law, be terminated.

§ 978. The supreme court has jurisdiction over all corporations, and the directors, managers, trustees and other officers thereof, 1. To compel an officer to account for his official conduct in the management and disposition of its business or property: 2. To suspend an officer from exercising his functions, when it appears that he has abused his trust: 3. To compel the payment, or delivery, by an officer to such corporation, or to its creditors, of any money or property of such corporation, or the avails thereof, in his hands, or to pay the value of, or to deliver over, any property he may have -misapplied, or wasted, or acquired to himself, or withheld, in violation of his duty: 4.

To prevent the improper alienation or disposition of property, where there is reason to apprehend it will be made. But this jurisdiction does not deprive any corporate body, or public officer, of visitatorial power over any corporation.

Whenever the affairs of a corporation are closed by the supreme court, (except on a judgment, obtained by a creditor for the satisfaction of a debt,) the creditors are entitled to be paid ratably in proportion to the amount of their respective demands, as ascertained under the direction of the court, except, that, in case of the insolvency of a bank or banking association, the bill holders thereof are entitled to preference in payment over other creditors.

§ 981. A corporation may be adjudged to have forfeited its corporate rights, in either of the following cases: 1. When it has for one year neglected to pay its notes, or other evidences of debt, or has, for that period, suspended its ordinary and lawful business: 2. When, having banking powers, or authority to make loans on pledges or deposits, or to make insurance, it violates any of the provisions of the act under which it is incorporated, or of any other law.

§ 982. Any corporation mentioned in the last section, may be restrained by injunction from the further exercise of its corporate rights, and from receiving, paying, transferring, or delivering any money or other property, until the court otherwise order; and in that case, a receiver of the corporate property may be appointed. Such injunction may be granted in an action brought by the attorney general, in behalf of the state, to close the business of the corporation, or by a creditor or stockholder, in an action to have such forfeiture adjudged.

§ 983. If the action be brought by a creditor of a corporation, whose directors, officers or stockholders are, by law, personally liable for its debts, either absolutely or in any contingency, they may be made parties to the action, either at its commencement or subsequently, for the purpose of enforcing such liability.

§ 984. When a judgment has been rendered in such action, whether brought by the attorney general, or by a stockholder or creditor and the directors, officers or stockholders are personally liable for the debts, and have not been made parties, any creditor may commence an action, founded upon such judgment, to enforce the liability; and in such action, the former judgment is conclusive evidence of the matters therein adjudged.

§ 985. Whenever an execution, issued on a judgment against a corporation, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, by the sheriff of the county, where the principal office or place of business of the corporation is situated, and whenever a corporation is adjudged to have forfeited its corporate rights, the court must cause its affairs to be closed, its debts collected, its property converted into money, and its creditors paid in proportion to the amount of their respective debts, in the order provided in a case of a voluntary dissolution of a corporation, except that the bill-holders of an insolvent bank or banking association, must be preferred, as provided in section 980.

§ 986. When the property of the corporation is insufficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel each stockholder to pay any amount, that may remain unpaid, on the shares of stock held by him, or so much thereof, as is necessary to satisfy the debts, and when the officers or stockholders are personally liable for the debts, and the property of the corporation, together with the amount unpaid on the stock, is insufficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel contribution from the officers or stockholders, who may be liable to satisfy the balance of the debts, from each according to his liability.

§ 987. In any proceeding, pursuant to this chapter, to close the affairs of a corporation, the court may, on application of a stockholder, officer or creditor, restrain further proceedings by any creditor, in an action against the corporation, so far as may be proper, in order to prevent the waste of the funds by unnecessary litigation; and may by a notice, served or published as the court may direct, require all creditors to present and prove their claims, or become parties to the action, within a reasonable time, or be precluded from the benefit of any distribution, which may be made before such claim is proved.

§ 988.

By a resident of this state, for any cause of action: 2. By a plaintiff not a resident of this state, when the contract, on which the action is brought, was made or delivered in this state, or when any other cause of action has arisen, or the subject of the action is situated, within this state.

§ 990. All other causes of action, by one against another, whether arising on contract or not, survive to the personal representatives of the former, and against the personal representatives of the latter. Therefore the executors or administrators may maintain the action against the party, against whom the cause of action accrued, or after his death against his representatives.

§ 991. When the death of one is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the personal representatives of the former may maintain an action therefore against the latter, if the former might have maintained an action, had he lived, against the latter, for an injury caused by the same act or omission. But the action must be commenced, within two years after the act or omission, by which the death was caused; the damages thereon cannot exceed dye thousand dollars; and the amount recovered is to be for the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin, to be distributed to them in the same proportions as the personal property of the deceased person.

§ 992. In an action against several executors or administrators, they are all considered as one person representing their testator or intestate, and judgment may be taken, and execution issued against all who are named as defendants in the summons, although it he served only on part of them, in the same manner as if served on all, except as provided in the next section.

§ 993. When a judgment is taken against an administrator or executor upon failure to answer, it is not to be deemed evidence of assets in his hands, unless it appear that the complaint alleged assets, and was personally served an him.

§ 994. The time which shall have elapsed between the death of a person, and the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, on his estate, not exceed months, and the period of six months after the granting of such letters are net to be deemed any part of the time limited for the commencement of actions, by executors or administrators.

§ 995. An executor of an executor has no authority as such to commence or maintain an action or proceeding, relating to the property of the testator of the first executor, or to take any charge or control thereof.

§ 996. The real property, which belonged to a deceased person, is not bound, or in any way affected by a judgment against his executors or administrators, nor liable to be sold, by virtue of an execution issued upon such judgment.

§ 997. In an action against executors or administrators, in which the fact of their having administered the estate of their testator or intestate, or any part thereof comes in issue, and the inventory of the property of the deceased, filed by them is given in evidence; the same may be repelled by evidence: 1. That any property has been omitted in such inventory, or was not returned therein at its full value: 2. That such property has perished or been lost, without the fault of such executors or administrators; or that it has been fairly sold by them at private public sale, at a less price than the value so returned; or that, since the return of the inventory, such property has deteriorated or increased in value. In such action. the defendants cannot be charged for any things in action, specified in their inventory, unless it appear that they have been collected, or might with due diligence, have been collected.

§ 998. No person is liable to an action as executor of his own wrong, for having taken, received, or interfered with, the property of a deceased person; but is responsible to the executors, or general or special administrators, of such deceased person, for the value of all property so taken or received, and for all damages, caused by his acts, to the estate of the deceased.

§ 999. The next of kin of a deceased person are liable to an action by a creditor of the estate, to recover the distributive shares, received out of such estate, or so much thereof, as may be necessary to satisfy his debt. The action may be against all the next of kin jointly, or against any one or more of them severally.

§ 1000. In such action, the plaintiff may recover the value of all the assets received by all the defendants in the action, if necessary to satisfy his demand; and the amount of the recovery must be apportioned among the defendants, in proportion to the value of the assets received by each; and no allowance or deduction can be made from such amount, on account of there being. other relatives to whom assets have also been delivered.

§ 1001. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a recovery is bad pursuant to the last section, may maintain an action against all the other relatives of the testator, to whom any such assets have been paid, jointly, or against any of them separately, for a just and equal contribution, and may recover of each defendant such an amount as shall be in the same proportion to the whole sum collected of the plaintiff, as the value of the assets delivered to such defendant bore to the value of all the assets delivered to all the relatives of the deceased.

§ 1002. Legatees are liable to an action by a creditor of the testator to recover the value of any legacy received by them. The action may be brought against all or only one of the legatees. In such action the plaintiff cannot recover unless he shows: 1. That no assets were delivered by the executor or administrator of the deceased, to his next of kin: or 2. That the value of such assets has been recovered by some other creditor: or 3. That such assets are not sufficient to satisfy the demand of the plaintiff: And in the last case, he can recover only the deficiency. The whole amount which the plaintiff can recover, must be apportioned among all the legatees of the testator, in proportion to the amounts of their legacies respectively, and his proportion can only be recovered of each legatee.

§ 1003. If an action be brought against several next of kin jointly, or against several legatees jointly, for assets delivered to them, and a recovery be had against them, the costs of such action must be apportioned among the several defendants, in proportion to the amount of the debt or damages recovered against each of them.

§ 1004. In case of a judgment against several next of kin of a testator, or against several legatees, the payment or satisfaction of the amount recovered against any one of the defendants, discharges such defendant, and exonerates him and his property from the judgment.

§ 1005. Heirs and devisees are liable to an action by a creditor of a deceased person, to recover the debt, to the extent of the value of any real property inherited by; or devised to them. If such action be against the heirs, all the heirs who may be liable must be made parties to the action.

§ 1006. But the heirs are not liable for the debt, unless it appear that the personal assets of the deceased were not sufficient to discharge it, or that after due proceedings before the proper surrogate’s court, the creditor has been unable to collect the debt, from the personal representatives of the deceased; or from his next of kin or legatees. If the personal assets were sufficient to pay a part of the debt, or in case a part thereof shall have been collected, as mentioned, in the last section, the heirs of such diseased person are liable for the residue.

§ 1007. But the last section does not affect the liability of heirs for a debt of their ancestor, where such debt was, by his will, expressly charged exclusively on the real property descended to such heirs, or where such debt is by the will expressly directed to be paid out of the real property descended, before resorting to the personal property.

§ 1008. In cases where the next of kin, legatees, heirs, and devisees are liable for the debts of their ancestors: as herein provided, they must give preference in the payment of the same, and are liable therefore, in the following order: 1. Debts entitled to a preference under the laws of the United States: 2. Judgments against the ancestor or testator according to the priority thereof respectively: 3. Recognizances; bonds, sealed instruments, notes, bills, and unliquidated demands and accounts.

§ 1009. No preference can be given by any next kin, legatee, heir or devisee, to one debt over another of the same class, except one specified in the second subdivision of the last section; nor is a debt, due and payable, entitled to a preference over a debt not due; nor does the commencement of an action against any next of kin, legatee, heir or devisee, for the recovery of a debt, entitle it to a preference over others of the same class.

§ 1010. The next of kin, legatees, heirs and devisees, may show that there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied; or that there are unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the action is brought; and if it appear, that the value of the personal property delivered to them, or of the real estate descended or devised to them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class judgment must be rendered in their favor.

§ 1011. If the personal property delivered to such next of kin or legatees, or if the real estate descended or devised to such heirs and devisees, exceed the amount of debts which are entitled to a preference over the debt for which the action is brought, judgment must be rendered against them only for such a sum as shall be a just proportion to the other debts, of the same class with that on which the action is brought.

§ 1012. If a debt of a class prior to that on which the action is brought, or of the same class, shall have been paid by any next of kin, legatees, heirs or devisees, they may prove such payment, and the amount of the debts so paid must be estimated in ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same manner as if such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the last two sections.

§ 1013. If it appear that the real property so descended, was not aliened by the heir, at the time of the commencement of the action, or if the heir confess the claim, and show what real property has descended to him, the court must order that the debt of the plaintiff, or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover, be levied of the real property so descended, and not otherwise; and every judgment rendered in such action has preference, as a lien on the real property descended, to any judgment obtained against such heir personally, for a debt or demand in his own right.

§ 1014. When it appears, in the action, that before the commencement thereof; the heir has aliened the real property descended to him, or any part thereof‘, he shall be personally liable for the value of the property so aliened, and judgment may be rendered therefore and execution awarded, as in actions for his own ‘debts. But no real property aliened in good faith by an heir, before action commenced against him, is liable to execution, or in any manner affected by a judgment against him.

§ 1015. In actions brought against several heirs jointly, or several devisees jointly, the amount, which the plaintiff recovers, must be apportioned, among all the heirs of the ancestor, or among all the devisees of the testator, in proportion to the value of the real property descended or devised, and such proportion only can be recovered of each heir or legatee.

§ 1016. Devisees made liable, by the foregoing provisions of this chapter, to the creditors of their testator, are not so liable, unless it appear that his personal assets and the real property of the testator descended to his heirs were insufficient to discharge the debt; or unless it appear, that after due proceedings before the surrogate, the creditor has been unable to recover the debt, or any part thereof, from the personal representatives of the testator, or from his next of kin or legatees, or from his heirs.

§ 1017. In either of the cases specified in the last section, the amount of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the real property descended to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, and the amount which such plaintiff may have failed to recover from the personal representatives of the testator, his next of kin, legatees and heirs, may be recovered of the devisees of such testator, to the extent of the real property devised to them respectively.

§ 1018. But the last two sections do not affect the liability of devisees, for a debt of their testator, where such debt was, by his will, expressly charged exclusively upon the real property devised, or by the terms of the will made payable exclusively by such devisee, or made payable out of the real property devised, before resorting to the personal property or to any other real property descended or devised.

§ 1019. The provisions of this chapter, with regard to heirs, and to proceedings by and against them, and to judgments and executions against them, are applicable to actions and proceedings against devisees; and they must, in like manner, be sued jointly.

§ 1020. In cases where, by the provisions of any statute, a child born after the making of a will, is entitled to succeed to a portion of the testator’s real and personal property, such child shall have the same rights and remedies to compel a distribution of the personal property and a partition of the real property, as are provided for next of kin and for heirs; and shall, in all respects, be liable, in the same manner and to the same extent, to the creditors of his ancestor, in respect to the personal property delivered to him, and the real property descended to him, as are herein prescribed in relation to next of kin and heirs; and such child may recover of the legatees and devisees who may have received or taken any real or personal property of the testator, the share or portion thereof to which he may be entitled.

§ 1021. The provisions of the last two sections relative to a child, born after the making of a will, apply equally to every person, who being a witness to a will, is entitled, by the provisions of any statute, to recover a portion of the real or personal property, of the testator, from the legatees and devisees named in such will.

§ 1022. The official bond, or other security, of a public officer, to the people of this state, whether with or without securities, is to be construed as security to the people of the state, as a government, and also to all persons severally, for the official delinquencies, against which it is intended to provide. If it be to a county, town, city, village or other municipal body, it is, in like manner, to be construed as security severally to all persons intended to be secured, as well as to the body politic named therein.

§ 1023. When a public officer, by official misconduct or neglect of duty, forfeits his official bond, or renders his sureties liable upon an official security, any person, injured thereby, or who is, by law, entitled to the benefit of the security, may bring an action thereon, in his own name, against the officer and his sureties, to recover the amount to which he may be entitled, by reason of the delinquency.

§ 1024. Before an action can be brought by a plaintiff, other than the people, or body politic named in the security, leave must be obtained of the court or a judge thereof, or a county judge, within the district or county where the action is triable; and leave can only be granted, on a production of the copy of the bond, and an affidavit showing the delinquency; and if the delinquency be such, as that if established on the trial, it would entitle the party applying to recover in the action, leave must be granted.

§ 1025. A judgment in favor of a party for one delinquency, does not preclude the same, or another party, from an action on the same security, for another delinquency.

§ 1026. If it appear in an action against a surety, on an official security, that he has already been obliged, by reason of prior recoveries against him on the same, to pay amounts, which, in the aggregate, are equal to the extent of his undertaking, or that, by reason of the insolvency of his principal, he will be obliged to pay to that extent on judgments already recovered against the surety. And the recovery against a surety must, in all cases, be limited by the amount of his undertaking.

§ 1027. Upon the execution issued on a judgment, recovered upon the official security of a public officer against him and a surety, there must be endorsed a direction to the officer, to whom the execution is delivered, to collect the same out of the property of the principal, if sufficient can be found, and if not, then to collect it out of the property of the surety.

§ 1028. If there be several judgments on which executions are, at the same time, in the sheriff’s hands, against a public officer and his sureties, amounting in the aggregate to a sum greater than that, for which the sureties are liable, the court must, on their application, limit the amount to be collected of them, to the amount of their respective liabilities, and may cause the same to be applied on the judgments or executions, in proportion to such amounts.

§ 1029. Actions for fines and forfeitures, may be prosecuted by the officers or persons, to whom they are by law given, or who, by special provision of law, are authorized to recover them; and whether prosecuted by public officers, or by private persons, are governed by the same rules as other civil actions, except as otherwise specified in this chapter.

§ 1030. When an action is brought for a penalty, which is limited bylaw, not to exceed a certain amount, the action may be brought for that amount; and upon the trial, the amount recovered, must be determined in proportion to the offence.

§ 1031. A recovery of a judgment, for a penalty or a forfeiture, by collusion between the parties, with intent to save the defendant from the consequences contemplated by law, in a case where the penalty or forfeiture is given, wholly or partly, to the prosecutor, does not prevent the recovery of the same by another person.

§ 1032. Fines and forfeitures, not specially granted or appropriated by law, must be paid into the treasury of the state; and whenever by the provisions of law, any property, real or personal, is forfeited to the people of this state, or to any officer for their use, an action for the recovery of such property, alleging the grounds of the forfeiture, may be brought by the proper officer, in the supreme court.

§ 1036. An action may be brought against the officers mentioned in section 1033, in their official capacity, or against the body they represent, either upon a contract made by such officers in their official capacity, and within the scope of their authority, or for an injury to the rights of the plaintiff, arising from some act or omission of such officers, or of the body represented by them.

§ 1039. The board of supervisors must thereupon cause the amount due on the judgment, with interest, from the time of the recovery until the first Monday in February after such meeting, to be added to the tax of the town or county, for whose liability the same was recovered, and the same must be collected as other contingent charges of the town or county.

§ 1040.

§ 1042. Execution cannot be issued on a judgment, mentioned in sections 1038 and 1040, without leave of the court, nor must leave be granted, until the court is satisfied that payment has been demanded of the proper county, or town officers, as provided in the last two sections, and that the board of supervisors have wrongfully omitted to include the amount in the tax list, as provided in section 1039. When execution is issued, the property of the county, or town, only is liable thereon.

When he has reason to believe, that such letters patent were issued through mistake or in ignorance of a material fact: or, 3. When he has reason to believe, that the patentee, or those claiming under him, have done or omitted an act, in violation of the terms and conditions on which the letters patent were granted, or have, by any other means, forfeited the interest acquired under the same.

§ 1050. When an action is brought by the attorney general, by virtue of this chapter, on the complaint or information of a person having an interest in the question, the name of such person must be joined with the people, as plaintiff.

§ 1051. Whenever such action is brought against a person for usurping an office, the attorney general, in addition to the statement of the cause of action, may also set forth in the complaint, the name of the person rightfully entitled to the office, with a statement of his right thereto, and in such case, upon proof by affidavit, that the defendant has received fees or emoluments belonging to the office, and by means of his usurpation thereof, an order may be granted by a judge of the supreme court, for the arrest of such defendant, and holding him to bail, and thereupon he may be arrested and held to bail, in the same manner, and with the same effect, and subject to the same rights and liabilities, as in other civil actions, where the defendant is subject to arrest.

§ 1052. In every such case, judgment maybe rendered upon the right of the defendant, and also upon the right of the party, so alleged to be entitled, or only upon the right of the defendant, as justice requires.

§ 1053.

§ 1054. If the defendant refuse or neglect to deliver over such books or papers, pursuant to the demand, he is to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and the same proceedings may be had, and with the same effect, to compel delivery of such books and papers, as are prescribed in article five, title six, chapter six, of the first part of the Revised Statutes.

§ 1055. If judgment be rendered, upon the right of the person so alleged to be entitled, in favor of such person, he may recover, by action, the damages which he shall have sustained, by reason of the usurpation of the office by the defendant.

§ 1056. Where several persons claim to be entitled to the same office or franchise, one action may be brought against all such persons, in order to try their respective rights to such office or franchise.

§ 1057. When a defendant, whether a natural person or a corporation, against whom such action has been brought, is adjudged guilty of usurping or intruding into, or unlawfully holding or exercising an office, franchise or privilege, judgment must be rendered, that such defendant be excluded from the office, franchise or privilege, and also that the plaintiff recover costs against such defendant. The court may also, in its discretion, impose upon the defendant a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars; which fine when collected, must be paid into the treasury of the state.

§ 1058. If it be adjudged, that a corporation, against which an action shall have been brought, pursuant to this chapter, has by neglect, abuse, or surrender, forfeited its corporate rights, privileges and franchises, judgment must be rendered, that the corporation be excluded from such corporate rights privileges and franchises, and that the corporation be dissolved.

§ 1059. If judgment be rendered in such action, against a corporation or against persons claiming to be a corporation, the court may cause the costs therein to be collected, by execution against the persons claiming to be a corporation, or by process against the directors or other officers of such corporation.

§ 1060. When such judgment is rendered against a corporation, the court has the same power to restrain the corporation, to appoint a receiver of its property, and to take an account and make distribution thereof among its creditors, as are given in the chapter upon actions respecting corporations, and in the chapter upon the voluntary dissolution of corporations, and it is the duty of the attorney general, immediately after the rendition of such judgment, to institute proceedings for that purpose.

§ 1061. Upon the rendition of such judgment against a corporation, or for the vacating or annulling of letters patent, it is the duty of the attorney-general, to cause a copy of the judgment roll to be forthwith filed in the office of the secretary of state.

§ 1062. Such secretary must thereupon, if the record relate to letters patent, make an entry in the records of the commissioners of the land office, of the substance and effect of the judgment, and of the time when the record thereof was docketed; and the real property granted by the letters patent, may thereafter be disposed of by such commissioners, in the same manner as if the letters patent had never been issued.

They are not required to be in any particular form, but must be such, as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.

§ 1087. The complaint must state in a plain and direct manner, the facts constituting the cause of action.

§ 1088.

§ 1089. When the answer contains a counter claim, the plaintiff may reply, denying any of the material allegations relating thereto.

§ 1090. A statement in an answer or reply, that the party has not sufficient knowledge or information in respect to a particular allegation in the previous pleading of the adverse party, to form a belief, is equivalent to a denial.

§ 1091.

The court may at the time of the pleading, require that such writing or account be exhibited to the inspection of the adverse party, with liberty to copy the same; or if not so exhibited, may prohibit its being afterwards given in evidence.

§ 1092. Every complaint, answer, or reply, must be verified by the oath of the party pleading, or if he be not present, by the oath of his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true. The verification must be oral or in writing, in conformity with the pleading verified.

§ 1093. Every material allegation in a complaint, or relating to a counter-claim in an answer, not denied by the pleading of the adverse party, must, on the trial be taken to be true, except, that when a defendant, who has not been served with a copy of the complaint with the summons, fails to appear and answer, the plaintiff, cannot recover, without proving his case.

§ 1094. Either party may object to a pleading of his adversary, or to any part thereof; that it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to understand it, or that it contains no cause of action or defense, although it be taken as true. If the court deem the objection well founded, it must order the pleading to be amended, and, if the party refuse to amend, the defective pleading must be disregarded.

§ 1095. A variance between the proof on the trial, and the allegations in a pleading, must be disregarded as immaterial, unless the court be satisfied, that the adverse party has been misled to his prejudice thereby.

§ 1096. The pleadings may be amended, at any time before the trial, or during the trial, or upon appeal, to supply any deficiency or omissions in the allegations or denial, necessary to support the action or defense when by such amendment, substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made after the issue, and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party, in consequence of such amendment, an adjournment must be granted. The court may also, in its discretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the court, not exceeding three dollars; but such payment cannot be required, unless an adjournment is made necessary by the amendment; nor can an amendment be allowed after a witness is sworn on the trial, when an adjournment thereby will be made necessary.

§ 1099. Upon the defendant’s making such an answer, or if he have been arrested, upon such answer and undertaking, the justice must enter an order in his docket transferring the action to the supreme court; and the proceedings must thenceforth be conducted in that court, in all respects as if the action had been first commenced therein; and costs shall there be given without regard to the amount recovered; the costs before the justice being added as disbursements. The plaintiff may, however, by a notice served within twenty days thereafter, decline to prosecute his action in the supreme court; in such case, the claim shall be deemed abandoned, and no costs shall be recovered against him in the supreme court.

§ 1100. The defendant is not at liberty to give evidence, by which the question of title to real property is raised on the trial before a justice. And when from the plaintiff’s own showing, on the trial, it appears that the determination of the action will necessarily involve the decision of a question of title to real property, the justice must dismiss the action, with costs, stating on his docket the reason therefore; but such dismissal shall not preclude the plaintiff from an action in the supreme court for the same cause.

§ 1101. When the title to real property is set forth in the answer as provided in section 1097, or appears on the trial as provided in the last section, and there are other causes of action in the complaint, not affected by the question of title, the order to transfer or to dismiss the action, shall not include such other causes; but as to them, the action must be severed, and tried before the justice in the same manner, as if the question of title had not been raised.

§ 1102. Upon the return day, if a jury be required, or if the justice be actually engaged in other official business, he may adjourn the trial without the consent of either party, as follows: 1. Where a party, who is not a resident of the county, is in attendance; or where the defendant is in attendance under arrest; the adjournment not to exceed twenty-four hours; and the defendant, if under arrest, to continue in custody: 2. In other cases, not to exceed five days, unless by consent of parties. If the trial be not adjourned, it must take place immediately upon the return of the summons.

§ 1103. The trial may be adjourned by consent, or upon application of either party, without the consent of the other, for a period not exceeding eight days, as follows: 1. The party asking the adjournment must, if required by his adversary, prove by his own oath or otherwise, that he cannot, for want of material testimony, which he expects to procure, safely proceed to trial: 2. If the application be on the part of the plaintiff, and the defendant be under arrest, an adjournment for more than twenty-four hours, discharges the defendant from custody, but the action may proceed notwithstanding: and the defendant shall be subject to arrest on the execution in the same manner as if he had not been so discharged: 3. If the application be on the part of a defendant under arrest, before it can be granted, he must execute an undertaking, with one or more sufficient sureties to be approved by the justice, as follows: If the arrest be for a cause specified in the first four subdivisions of section 1071, or in the sixth, the undertaking must be to the effect, that he will appear at the return day, and not depart from the court until duly discharged, or until after the trial and judgment, and after a reasonable opportunity to arrest him on execution issued upon the judgment, if any be obtained against him. If the arrest be for a cause specified in subdivision 5, of that section, the undertaking must be to the effect, that no part of the property of the defendant, liable to be taxes on execution, shall be removed, secreted, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except for the necessary support, for the time, of himself and family, until the plaintiff ’s demand be satisfied, or until the expiration of ten days after the judgment, if any be obtained against him in the action: 4. Either party applying for an adjournment, must also, if required by the adverse party, consent that the testimony of any witnesses of such adverse party who are in attendance, be then taken by deposition before the justice, which must accordingly be done; and the testimony so taken may be read on the trial with the same effect, and subject to the same objections, as if the witness were produced.

§ 1104. An adjournment may be had, either at the time of joining the issue, or at any subsequent time to which the cause may stand adjourned, on application of either party, for a period longer than eight days, but not to exceed ninety days from the time of the return of the summons, upon compliance with the provisions of the last section, and upon proof; by the oath of the party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the justice, that such party cannot be ready for trial before the time to which he desires an adjournment, for the want of material evidence, describing it, that the delay has not been made necessary by any act or negligence on his part, since the action was commenced, and that he expects to procure the evidence at the time stated by him.

§ 1105. If the plaintiff fail to appear at the return day of the summons and make his complaint, the action must be dismissed. If the defendant fail to appear at the return day of the summons, or if either party fail, to attend at a day to which the trial has been adjourned, or fail to make the necessary pleading or proof on his part, the case may nevertheless proceed at the request of the adverse party; and judgment must be given in conformity with the pleadings and proofs.

§ 1106. A trial by jury must be demanded at the time of joining issue; and is waived, if neither party then demand it. When demanded, the trial of the case must be adjourned, until a time and place fixed for the return of the jury. If neither party desire an adjournment, the time and place must be determined by the justice, and must be on the same day or within the next two days. The jury must be immediately drawn and summoned, and the return thereof made as prescribed in sections 317, 318, and 319.

§ 1107. At the time appointed for the trial, and on the return of the order, if the trial be not further adjourned, and if adjourned, then at the time to which the trial is adjourned, the justice must proceed to draw from the jurors summoned, the names of persons to constitute the jury for the trial of the issue. Six jurors constitute a jury, but by consent of parties, a less number may act.

§ 1108. If a sufficient number of competent and indifferent jurors do not attend, the justice must direct others to be summoned by a constable, from the vicinity, sufficient to complete the jury.

§ 1109. The ballots containing names of jurors not summoned, if any, and of those summoned, but not drawn, must be returned by the justice to the drawn jury box, except that such of them as contain the names of persons, not liable to serve as jurors, must be destroyed. The ballots containing the names of the jurors, who serve, must not be returned to the same box from which they were taken, until all the names have been drawn out. As often as that happens, the whole number must be returned to the undrawn jury box, to be drawn as in the first instance.

§ 1110. Before a party can be entitled to a jury, he must deposit with the justice the sum of three dollars, for jury fees, from which the justice must refund to the party the fees of all jurors who do not attend, and those not refunded must be included in the judgment as part of the costs, in case the party calling the jury recover judgment.

§ 1111. No adjournment can be granted after the return of the jury, unless the party requiring the same, in addition to the other conditions imposed on him, deposit with the justice, to be immediately paid to the jurors attending, the sum of twenty-five cents each, which amount is in no case to be included as part of the costs in the judgment. After the adjournment the jurors must attend at the time and place appointed, without further notice, and the fees deposited when the jury was demanded, with the justice, may remain in his hands until the jury are empaneled, and must be then paid over to them.

§ 1112. If either party object to the competency of a juror the question thereon must be tried in a summary manner by the justice, who may examine the juror or other witnesses on oath.

§ 1113. The verdict of the jury must be general, for the plaintiff, for a specified sum, or for the defendant; or when there is a counter claim proved, exceeding the demand of the plaintiff as proved; for the defendant for a specified sum.

§ 1114. Judgment that the action be dismissed, with out prejudice to a new action, may be entered with costs, in the following cases: 1. When the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the action, before it is finally submitted: 2. When he fails to appear at the time specified in the summons, or upon adjournment, or within one hour thereafter: 3. When it is objected at the trial, and appears by the evidence, that the action is brought in the wrong county or town or by a plaintiff not a resident of the county, without giving security, as provided in section 1082; but if the objection be taken and overruled, it is cause only of reversal on appeal, and does not otherwise invalidate the judgment, if not taken, at the trial, it is waived, and is no cause of reversal.

§ 1115. When the defendant fails to appear and answer, judgment must be given for the plaintiff, as follows: 1. Where a copy of the complaint and account, or instrument, has been served personally with the summons, as prescribed in section 1069, judgment must be given without further evidence for the sum specified in the summons: 2. In other cases the justice must hear the evidence of the plaintiff, and render judgment for such sum only as shall appear by the evidence to be just; but in no case to exceed the amount specified in the summons.

§ 1116. Upon issue joined, if a jury trial be not demanded, the justice must hear the evidence, and decide all questions of fact and of law, and render judgment accordingly.

§ 1117. Upon a verdict, the justice must immediately render judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the justice, judgment must be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if the defendant has been arrested, or his property attached: in other cases, it must be entered either at the close of the trial, or, if the justice then desire further time to consider, on the fourth day thereafter, both days inclusive.

§ 1118. When the amount found due to either party exceeds the sum, for which the justice is authorized to enter judgment, such party may remit the excess, and judgment may be entered for the residue.

§ 1119. In an action arising on contract, when there is no counter claim, if the plaintiff fail to recover judgment for an amount equal to that stated in his summons, he cannot recover costs.

§ 1120. If the defendant, at any time before the trial, offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified sum, the plaintiff may immediately have judgment therefore, with the costs then accrued. But if he do not accept such offer before the trial, and fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the offer, he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer: but costs must be adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted from his recovery. But the offer, and failure to accept it, cannot be given in evidence, to affect the recovery, otherwise than as to costs, as above provided.

§ 1121. When a judgment is rendered, in a case where the defendant is subject to arrest and imprisonment thereon, it must be so stated in the judgment, and entered in his docket.

§ 1122. The justice, on the demand of a party in whose favor judgment is rendered, must give him a transcript thereof, which may be filed and docketed in the office of the clerk of the county where the judgment was rendered. The time of the receipt of the transcript by the county clerk, must be noted by him thereon, and entered in the docket; and from that time, the judgment creates a lien in the same manner, as a judgment of the supreme court. Upon a transcript of such docket, certified by the clerk of the county, and filed in any other county, the judgment may be there docketed with the same effect, from the time of filing and docketing in that county. The judgment so docketed, and the enforcement thereof, are subject to the control of the county court of the county where it was first docketed, as a judgment of that court. But a judgment for less than twenty-five dollars, so docketed, is not a lien upon, and cannot be enforced against real property.

§ 1123. Execution for the enforcement of a judgment in a justice’s court, except when it has been docketed in the county clerk’s office, may be issued by the justice before whom the judgment was rendered, or by his successor in office, on the application of the party entitled thereto, at any time within five years from the entry of judgment.

§ 1124. The execution must be directed to a constable of the county, and subscribed by the justice by whom the judgment was rendered, or by his successor in office, and must bear date of the day of its delivery to the officer to be executed. It must intelligibly refer to the judgment, by stating the names of the parties, and the name of the justice before whom, and of the county and town where, and the time when, it was rendered; the amount of the judgment; and, if less than the whole is due, the true amount due thereon. It must require the constable substantially as follows: 1. If it be a case where the defendant cannot be arrested, it must direct the officer to collect the amount of the judgment out of the personal property of the debtor, and to pay the same to the party entitled thereto: 2. If it be a case where the defendant may be arrested, in addition to the foregoing, it must direct the officer, if sufficient property of the defendant liable to the execution cannot be found to satisfy the judgment, that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county, until he pay the judgment, or be discharged according to law: 3. It must further, in all cases, direct the officer to make return of the execution, and a certificate thereon, showing the manner in which he has executed the same, in sixty days from the time of his receipt thereof.

§ 1125. Upon an execution on a judgment against joint debtors, upon one or more of whom the summons was not served, the execution must contain a direction to collect the amount out of the joint property of all the defendants, or the separate property of the persons upon whom the summons was served, to be specified by name. If such judgment be also such that the defendants are subject to arrest thereon, the justice must further specify the names of those defendants, served with the summons, who may be arrested for want of property.

§ 1126. A constable may, at his peril, omit to arrest a debtor; or after arrest, suffer him to go at large before the return day; subject only to his liability for an escape, or for omitting to arrest, if he fail to have either the money or the person of the debtor in custody at the expiration of the sixty days.

§ 1127. When an execution directs the arrest of the debtor for want of sufficient personal chattels, if there be not sufficient subject to levy known to the officer, or if upon demand by the officer of the debtor, he fail to produce sufficient property, the officer may without further delay arrest the defendant. When arrested, the defendant must be conveyed to the common jail of the county, and there be kept in custody until the execution with costs be paid, or he be discharged by due course of law.

§ 1128. The debtor committed as provided in the last section, may be held in prison ten days: and if he be a person without a family, for which he provides, one day in addition, for every dollar over ten due on the execution; or, if he have a family for which he provides, one day in addition, for every two dollars over twenty due on the execution.

§ 1129. The affidavit of an imprisoned debtor, that he has a family for which he provides, specifying by name one or more persons, members of such a family, and the place of their residence, is sufficient evidence thereof, to authorize his discharge by the jailor.

§ 1130. An execution may, at the request of the plaintiff, be renewed before the expiration of sixty days from the time of its issue, by the word renewed written thereon, with the date thereof, and subscribed by the justice. Such renewal has the effect of an original issue; and may be repeated as often as may be necessary. If an execution be returned unsatisfied, another may be afterwards issued.

§ 1131. A debtor cannot be arrested, nor his property sold on execution, after sixty days from its issue or renewal; but property levied on within the sixty days, may be sold after a renewal.

§ 1132. A constable is liable to the party in whose favor an execution is issued to him, for the amount thereof, in the following cases: 1. When he suffers sixty days to elapse, without making a true return thereof to the justice, and paying to him or to the party entitled, the money collected thereon by him: 2. When he willfully or carelessly omits to levy upon property; or if the debtor be liable to arrest, to arrest and imprison him, within sixty days; or having arrested the debtor, fails to commit him to the county jail, within the sixty days.

§ 1133. Upon a justice’s judgment docketed in a county clerk’s office, execution can only be issued by the clerk with whom the transcript is filed, or by the plaintiff in person: and it may be sent to one or more counties where the judgment is docketed. It must conform substantially to the execution issued by a justice, except that it must state the time when the judgment was docketed in the county from which it is issued, and must be directed to the sheriff; and may direct, that for want of sufficient personal property, the debt be made out of the real property of the debtor.

§ 1135. Every justice must keep a book, denominated a docket, in which must be entered by him, 1. The title of every action in which the summons is returned served, or when the parties voluntarily appear: 2. The date of the summons, and the time of its return; and if an order to arrest the defendant or attach property was made, such fact must also be stated: 3. The time when the parties, or either of them, appeared; a minute of the pleadings; if in writing, referring to them; if not in writing, a concise statement of the material parts of the pleadings: 4.

The giving of a transcript to be filed in the county c1erk’s office, and when given: 11. The receipt of a notice of appeal, or order to make or amend a return, stating the time of the receipt, and the fees therefore.

§ 1136. The several particulars in the last section specified, must be entered under the title of the action to which they relate, and at the time when they occur. Such entries in a justice’s docket, or a transcript thereof, certified by the justice, or his successor in office, are primary evidence to prove the facts so dated therein.

§ 1137. A justice must keep an alphabetical index to his docket, in which must be entered the names of the; parties to each judgment, with a reference to the page of the entry. The names of the plaintiffs must be entered in the index, in the alphabetical order of the first letter of the family names.

§ 1138. It is the duty of every justice, upon the expiration of his term of office, to deposit with his successor his official dockets, as well his own as those of his predecessor, which may be in his custody; there to be kept as public records. If the office of a justice become vacant, by his death, or removal from the town or otherwise, before his successor is elected and qualified, the dockets, in possession of such justice, must be deposited with the supervisor of the town, to be by him delivered to the successor in office of the justice.

§ 1139. Any justice, with whom the docket of predecessor is deposited, may issue execution on a judgment there entered and unsatisfied, and not docketed in the county clerk’s office, in the same manner and with the same effect, as the justice, by whom the judgment was rendered, might have done.

§ 1140. The justice elected to fill a vacancy, or when elected, chosen by lot to fill a vacancy for less than a full term, is deemed the successor of the justice whose office became vacant before the expiration of a full term. When a full term expires, the same or another person elected to take office in the same town, from that time is deemed the successor.

§ 1141. When two or more justices are equally entitled, under the last section, to be deemed the successors in office of a justice, the supervisor of the town must by a certificate subscribed by him, and filed in the office of the town clerk, with a duplicate attached to the last docket, designate which justice is to be deemed the successor of a justice going out of office or whose office has become vacant.

§ 1142. The summons, execution, and every other paper made or issued by a justice, must be filled up without a blank left to be filled by another; otherwise it is void.

§ 1143. Every justice now in office and every justice hereafter elected, before entering upon the duties of his office, must, by appointment in writing, filed with the town clerk, assign a day of the week, and a place at which, a summons, issued by a plaintiff himself, may be made returnable before him. It is the duty of the justice to attend at his office, thus designated, on the day assigned for returns, from nine o’clock in the morning until four o’clock in the afternoon.

§ 1144. The day so appointed must not be the same, specified in the appointment of another justice of the same town previously filed. The place so designated may be known as the justice’s office and may be afterwards changed by him, on filing a new appointment, and posting notices thereof in three public places of the town.

§ 1145. In case of the sickness, other disability, or necessary absence of a justice, at the time appointed, another justice of the same town may, at his request, attend in his behalf, and shall thereupon become vested with the power, for the time being, of the justice before whom the summons was returnable. In that case the proper entry of the proceeding before the attending justice, subscribed by him, must be made in the docket of the justice before whom the summons was returnable. If the case be adjourned, the justice before whom the summons was returnable, must resume jurisdiction.

§ 1146. A justice may at the request of a party, and on being satisfied that it is expedient, specially depute any discreet person, of suitable age, and not interested in the action, to serve a summons or execution, with or without an order to arrest the defendant, or to attach property. Such deputation must be in writing on the process.

§ 1147. The person so deputed has the authority of a constable in relation to the service, execution and return of such process, and is subject to the same obligations, but cannot receive a fee for the service.

§ 1148. When the sureties of a constable make complaint to a county judge, that such constable has unlawfully converted to his own use, or misapplied, money collected by him as constable, for which they have been sued, or are liable to be sued, such application being verified by oath that they believe it to be true, the county judge must immediately make an order, suspending such constable from the further exercise of his official powers, until he give new security. Such order must be served on the constable, and filed in the office of the town clerk.

§ 1149. When an execution is delivered to a constable, within the last sixty days of his term of office, he may, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, proceed thereon, in the same manner as if he still continued in office, and his sureties shall be liable to the same extent.

§ 1150. A justice may punish, as for a criminal contempt, persons guilty of the following acts, and no others : 1. Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the justice while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial, or other judicial proceeding: 2. A breach of the peace, boisterous conduct, or violent disturbance, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding: 3. Willful resistance in the presence of the justice, to the execution of a lawful order or process made or issued by him.

§ 1151. A warrant of arrest may be issued by such justice, on which the person so guilty may be arrested, and brought before the justice, on the same day, or the next judicial day, when an opportunity to be heard in his defense or excuse must be given. The justice may thereupon discharge him, or may convict him of the offence, and adjudge a punishment by fine or imprisonment, or both; such fine not to exceed twenty dollars, and such imprisonment, ten days.

§ 1152. The conviction, specifying particularly the offence and the judgment thereon, must be entered by the justice in his docket. A warrant of commitment to the jail of the county until the fine be paid, or for the term of the imprisonment, may then be issued. Such warrant must contain a transcript of the entry in the docket; and the same must be executed by any constable to whom it may be given, and by the jailer of the county.

§ 1153. If a person summoned as a juror or witness fail to attend, the justice may issue a warrant to arrest the delinquent for the purpose of compelling his attendance, and punishing his disobedience.

§ 1154. When the person arrested is brought before the justice, or when a person in attendance refuses to serve as a juror or to testify as a witness, and no valid excuse be shown, the justice may impose a fine upon him, not exceeding five dollars. An entry of such fine, stating the reason thereof, must be made by the justice in his docket, and thereupon shall have the effect of a judgment, in favor of the overseers of the poor of the town against the delinquent, and may be enforced as well against his person as his property.

§ 1155. The term “justice,” as used in this chapter, includes justice of the peace and justices of justices’ courts in cities; the term “town,” includes ward or district, in reference to justices’ courts in cities; and whenever other sections of the code are made applicable to justices’ courts, the term “judge” and “court” therein, are to be deemed to include justice and justices’ courts; and the term “sheriff,” to include constable.

§ 1156. For services rendered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, fees may be charged, and included in the judgment, as follows: For Justice’s Fees. 1. For all proceedings when the defendant does not answer, including judgment, transcript and execution, one dollar: 2. For all proceedings to, and including the issue, if an order to arrest a defendant, or to attach property, be made, one dollar; if there be no order to arrest, or to attach property, fifty cents: 3. For all proceedings after issue, to and including trial by jury, if there be one, one dollar and fifty cents. If there be no jury, one dollar: 4. For judgment upon the issue and any proceedings afterwards, including transcript, executions, returns, and all other proceedings and entries, fifty cents: 5. Postage actually paid, on sending or receiving a a commission to take testimony.

§ 1157. Constables are entitled to receive, from the party in whose favor the services are rendered, the following fees; of which those rendered before judgment may be included therein, when it is in favor of the party liable therefore: 1. For serving a summons or execution, and making return, including a copy, when there is no arrest or attachment of property, for each defendant served, twenty cents: 2. When the defendant is arrested; for serving the summons, making the arrest, and giving notice to the plaintiff, including copies and return, forty cents for one defendant, and twenty cents for each defendant, more than one, arrested: 3. When property is attached; for serving summons, attaching property, including copies, inventories and return, fifty cents for one defendant, and ten cents for each defendant more than one: 4. For travel; going to serve a summons, or give notice to the plaintiff, or to arrest a debtor on execution, or to summon a jury, six cents for each mile more than one ; to be computed for one person only, from the justice’s office to the place where the service is made; but when there is more than one defendant included in the same summons or execution, and in the case of summoning a jury, the constable must certify in his return the number of miles actually and necessarily travelled to make the service on all the persons served, and his fees shall be accordingly; when a debtor is arrested on execution and committed to jail, ten cents for each mile, from the place where the arrest is made, to the jail: 5. For collecting money on execution, and paying it over where property is not sold: four cents for every dollar collected to fifty dollars, and two cents for every dollar above fifty. For advertising property, twenty-five cents; for selling property, fifty cents: 6. When an execution is settled by the parties while in the constable’s hands, he is entitled to receive from the party in whose favor it was issued, his fees for travel, and service actually performed, and one half the fees he would have been entitled to for collecting and paying over.

§ 1158. A witness is entitled to receive from the party in whose behalf he attends, to be included in a judgment in favor of the party liable therefore, as follows: If a resident of the city, village or town where the trial is had, twelve and a half cents; in other cases, twenty-five cents; also, four cents for each mile’s actual travel, going from his residence to the place of trial and returning.

§ 1159. Jurors are entitled to receive fees from the party who demands a jury trial, to be included in a judgment in his favor, twenty-five cents for attending, whether sworn or not, and the same fee for another attendance pursuant to adjournment, from the party applying therefore.

§ 1160. Upon an execution issued on a justice’s judgment docketed in a county clerk’s office, the same fees are allowed as on executions issued by a justice; except that when real property is sold, the printer’s fees for advertising may be charged in addition, and also, the same fees for a certificate of sale, and for a sheriff’s deed, as are allowed in the supreme court.

§ 1161. If a justice, constable, witness or juror receive greater fees than are allowed by law, the excess may be recovered back, even though they may not be included in the judgment.

§ 1195. If the appellant desire a stay of execution of the judgment, he must give security as provided in the next section.

§ 1196. The security must be a written undertaking, executed by one or more sufficient sureties, approved by the county judge, or by the court below, to the effect, that if judgment be rendered against the appellant, and execution thereon be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the sureties will pay the amount unsatisfied.

§ 1197. The delivery of the undertaking to the court below stays the issuing of execution; or if it have been issued, the service of a copy of the undertaking, certified by the court below, upon the officer holding the execution, stays further proceedings thereon.

§ 1199. When the affidavit and notice of appeal have been served, the respondent may supply or correct material omissions or misstatements therein by an affidavit on his part, a copy of which must be served on the attorney, if any, who prosecutes the appeal, or if there be none, on the appellant, if to be found in the county, at least one day before the time for hearing the appeal.

§ 1201. The court below must thereupon, within the ten days, make a return to the appellate court of the testimony, proceedings and judgment, and file the same, with the order and affidavits, in the appellate court, and may be compelled to do so by the appellate court. But a justice is not bound to make a return, unless the fee prescribed by the last section of this chapter be paid on service of the order.

§ 1202. If the return be defective, the appellate court may direct a further or amended return, as often as may be necessary, and may compel a compliance with its order.

§ 1203. When a justice of the peace, by whom a judgment appealed from was rendered, shall have gone out of office, ‘or removed to another county, before a return is made, he must, nevertheless, make a return, in the same manner, and with the same effect, as if he were still in office, and may in the same manner be compelled to do so.

§ 1204. If a justice of the peace, whose judgment is appealed from, die, become insane, or remove from the state, the appellate court may examine witnesses on oath, respecting the facts of the trial or judgment, and determine the appeal, as if the facts had been returned by the justice.

It must be placed upon the calendar and continue thereon without further notice, until finally disposed of; but if neither party bring it to a hearing before the end of the second term, the court must dismiss the appeal, unless it continue the same, by special order, for cause shown.

§ 1206. The appeal whether heard on the affidavits or return, must be heard on the original papers; and no copy thereof need be furnished for the use of the court.

§ 1207. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the appellate court must give judgment upon the law and the facts, according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors or defects, which do not affect the merits. In case of a reversal, the court may allow another action for the same cause.

§ 1208. To every judgment upon an appeal there must be annexed the affidavits or return on which it was heard, which must be filed with the clerk of the court, and constitute the judgment roll.

§ 1209. When upon a reversal, another action is allowed the rights of the parties stand unaffected by the former action. If another action be allowed, a concise statement of the reasons therefore must be filed with the clerk.

§ 1210. If the judgment below, or any part thereof, be collected and be afterwards reversed, the appellate court must order the amount collected to be restored with interest from the time of collection. The order may be obtained upon proof of the facts made at or after the hearing, upon a previous notice of six days.

§ 1211. If, upon an appeal, a recovery be had by one party, and costs be awarded to the other, the appellate court must set off the one against the other, and render judgment for the balance.

§ 1212. The following fees and costs, and no other, except fees of officers, are allowed on appeals; to the appellant, on reversal, if upon affidavits, ten dollars, if upon a return fifteen dollars.

§ 1267. The allowance of the writ of review, the writ of mandate, and the writ of assessment, rests in the sound discretion of the court. The writ of deliverance, when regularly applied for, cannot be refused.

§ 1268. The application for a state writ must be made to the supreme court, at a special term, except as provided in the next section.

§ 1269. The writ of deliverance from imprisonment, commonly known as the writ of habeas corpus, may be allowed, not only by the supreme court at a special term, but, out of court, by a judge of the supreme court, a judge of the superior court of the city of New-York, a judge of the court of common pleas of the city of New-York, a county judge, or the city judge of the city of New-York.

§ 1270. After the allowance of the writ of deliverance, all the proceedings thereon, to the judgment, inclusive, are had in the supreme court.

§ 1271. The writ of certiorari, whether at common law or by statute, shall hereafter be known as the writ of review of inferior jurisdictions.

The writ of review must command the defendant to certify fully to the supreme court, at a specified time and place, and annex to the writ, a transcript of the record and proceedings, (describing or referring to them, with convenient certainty,) that the same may be reviewed by the supreme court; and requiring the party, in the mean time, to desist from further proceedings in the matter to be reviewed.

§ 1273. If a stay of proceedings be not intended, the words requiring the stay, may be omitted from the writ. These words may be inserted, or omitted, in the sound discretion of the court.

§ 1274. The effect of the writ is to remove, not the record, but the transcript thereof; therefore, the power of the inferior court or officer is not suspended, not the proceedings stayed, unless an order to that effect be inserted in the writ.

§ 1275. The writ may be granted, wherever specially authorized by this code, and also in all cases where an inferior tribunal, board, or officer, exercising judicial functions, is alleged to have exceeded the jurisdiction of such tribunal, board, or officer; and where there is no appeal, nor, in the judgment of the court, any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy.

§ 1276. Except where otherwise expressly provided by this code or another statute, the review upon this writ cannot be extended further, than to determine whether the inferior tribunal, board, or officer, has regularly pursued the authority of such tribunal, board or officer.

§ 1277. The writ may be directed to such tribunal, board, or officer, or to any other person having the custody of the record or proceedings to be certified.

§ 1278. The motion for the writ must be made upon affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the application to be given to the adverse party, or may grant an order to shew cause why it should not be allowed, or may grant the writ without notice.

§ 1279. The allowance of the writ must be endorsed thereon, signed by the judge granting it, and the writ must be served in the same manner, as a summons in a civil action, except where otherwise expressly provided.

§ 1280. If the return to the writ be defective, the court may order a further return to be made. When a full return has been made, the court must proceed to hear the parties, or such of them as may attend for that purpose, and may thereupon give judgment, either affirming or annulling the proceedings below.

§ 1281. A copy of the judgment, signed by the clerk, entered upon, or attached to, the writ and return, constitute the judgment roll. From the judgment, an appeal may be taken to the general term, and thence to the court of appeals, in the same manner and upon the same terms, as from a judgment in a single action.

Fine may be imposed in certain cases.

§ 1282. The writ, heretofore known as the writ of mandamus, shall be hereafter denominated the writ of mandate. Such writ is defined and regulated as in this chapter prescribed.

§ 1283. It may be issued to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person, to compel the performance of an act, which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. But though it may require an inferior tribunal to exercise its judgment or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions, it cannot control judicial discretion.

§ 1284. This writ ought not to be issued, in any case where there is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of the law. It is issued, on the information of the party beneficially interested.

§ 1285. The writ is either alternative or peremptory. The alternative writ must state concisely the facts showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission to perform it, and command him, that immediately after the receipt of the writ, or a some other specified time, he do the act required to be performed, or show cause before the supreme court, at a specified time and place, why he has not done so; and that he then and there return the writ, with his certificate of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a similar form, except that the words requiring the defendant to show cause why he has not done as commanded, must be omitted.

§ 1286. When the right to require the performance of the act is clear, and it is apparent, that no valid excuse can be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandate may be allowed in the first instance. In all other cases, the alternative writ must be first issued.

§ 1287. The motion for the writ, the allowance, and the service thereof; and the enforcement of obedience thereto, must be in the same manner, as in case of the writ of review.

§ 1288. On the return day of the alternative writ, or such further day as the court may allow, the party, on whom the writ shall have been served, may show cause, by answer made, in the same manner as an answer to a complaint in a civil action.

§ 1289. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandate must be allowed against the defendant. If an answer be made, containing new matter, the same shall not in any respect conclude the plaintiff, who may on the trial or other proceedings avail himself of any valid objection to its sufficiency, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct denial or by way of avoidance.

§ 1290. No other pleading, or written allegation, is allowed than the writ and answer. These are the pleadings in the case, and have the same effect, and are to be construed and may be amended, in the same manner, as pleadings in a civil action, and the issues thereby joined must be tried, and the further proceedings thereon had in the same manner, as in a civil action.

§ 1291. Issues joined in the case, must be tried in the county where the material facts set forth in the mandate are alleged to have occurred.

§ 1292. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he shall recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be ascertained by the court or a jury, or by referees, as in a civil action, together with costs and charges; and a peremptory mandate must also be awarded without delay.

§ 1293. A recovery of damages by virtue of this chapter, against a party, who shall have made a return to a writ of mandate, is a bar to any other action against the same party, for the making of such return.

§ 1294. Whenever a peremptory mandate is directed by a public officer, body, or board, commanding the performance of any public duty, specially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court that such officer, or any member of such body, or board, has, without just excuse refused or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, upon every such officer or member of such body or board. Such line, when collected must be paid into the treasury; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action, for any penalty incurred by such officer or member of such body or board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.

§ 1295. The writ heretofore known as the writ of ad quod damnum, shall be hereafter denominated the writ of assessment of damages.

§ 1296. Whenever the governor of this state is authorized by law to take possession of real property, within this state, for the use of the people of the state, and he cannot agree with the owner for the purchase thereof, he must cause application to be made for a writ of assessment, which shall thereupon be issued to the sheriff of the county, where such real property is situated, unless the court direct such damages to be assessed by a jury of another county, commanding him to summon a jury to inquire whether the owners of the property, describing it, will sustain any, and what damage, by the taking of the property for the use of the state.

§ 1297. Upon such writ being delivered to the sheriff, he must give at least three weeks notice of the time and place of executing the same, by publishing a notice thereof in a newspaper printed in his county.

§ 1298. The sheriff must summon twelve qualified jurors in his county, to attend at such time and place, and must then and there administer to each of the jurors an oath, that he will diligently inquire, concerning the matter specified in the writ, and will give a true verdict, according to the best of his judgment.

§ 1299. After the jury shall have been duly sworn, they must proceed to view the property specified in the writ, and having heard the evidence offered, and duly considered the value of the property, they must assess the damages which the owner, or if there be several, which the respective owners, will sustain by being deprived thereof. They must make an inquisition signed by themselves, and by the sheriff, in which they must set forth the names of the several owners of the property, and the rights of each owner respectively, so far as the same can be ascertained by them, together with the amount to be paid therefore by the people of this state, and to whom particularly; which inquisition the sheriff must forthwith return, together with the writ, to the supreme court.

§ 1300. The court must examine the inquisition, and if the same be partial or defective, may set the same aside, either wholly or in part, and may direct a new inquisition to be taken, to supply such defect.

§ 1301. Whenever the writ appears to have been duly executed, an order must be entered, declaring that the people of this state, on paying to the owner or into the supreme court, the amount assessed in the inquisition for damages, and also the costs and charges of the proceedings, shall be entitled to an absolute estate in such real property, as fully and effectually, as if the name had been conveyed to the people by the owner thereof; and immediately after the payment of such amount, the absolute title to such real property shall be vested in the people of this state.

§ 1302. The amount which may be necessary to pay the damages assessed, and the costs and expenses incurred under the provisions of this chapter, must be paid out of the treasury.

§ 1303. Upon the damages so assessed being paid into the supreme court, the court must make an order for the investment thereof and of the interest thereon, in permanent securities, for the benefit of the owners of the property taken, and must cause such securities to be transferred to them, or the amount of the money paid over to them, their guardians or legal representatives, whenever their rights are established.

§ 1304. Such owners may, at any time, apply to the supreme court, for the payment to them of such money, or the transfer of such securities: and such proceedings must be had thereon, as are necessary to ascertain the respective rights of the applicants, and to give notice to all persons who may be interested in the property taken, or in the money paid into court.

§ 1305. Whenever any real property shall be taken for the use of the United States, by the consent of the legislature of this state, and it becomes necessary to issue a writ of assessment, the like proceedings must be had, as are provided in this chapter.

Every person, imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, within this state, for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, or under any pretense whatsoever, except in the cases specified in the next section, may prosecute a writ of deliverance, according to the provisions of this chapter, to inquire into the cause of such imprisonment or restraint; and if illegal, to be delivered therefrom.

§ 1308. The following persons are not entitled to prosecute the writ: 1.

Persons committed or detained by virtue of the judgment of a competent tribunal, of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or by virtue of an execution issued upon such judgment, but no order of commitment for contempt, is to be deemed a judgment nor a warrant or other process, issued upon such an order, an execution, within the meaning of this section.

§ 1309. Application for the writ must be made in writing, signed, either by the party for whose relief it is intended, or by some person in his behalf, as follows: 1. To the supreme court at a special term: 2. To any one of the judges of the supreme court, or any county judge, being or residing in the county where the party is detained; or, if there be no such officer within the county, or if he be absent, or for any cause incapable of acting, or have refused to grant the writ, then to such officer residing in an adjoining county: 3. In the city and county of New-York, to a judge of the superior court of the city of New-York, or a judge of the court of common pleas of the city of New-York, or the city judge of that city.

§ 1310. Whenever application for the writ is made to an officer, not residing within the county where the party is detained, he must require proof by the oath of the applicant, or by other sufficient evidence before granting the writ, that there is no officer in the county authorized to grant the writ, or if there he one that he is absent, or has refused to grant it, or for some cause to be specially set forth, is incapable of acting.

§ 1311. The application must state, in substance, 1. That the party, in whose behalf the writ is applied for, is imprisoned, or restrained of his liberty, the place where, and the officer or person by whom, he is imprisoned or restrained, naming both parties, if their names be known, or describing them, if not known: 2. That such person is not imprisoned or restrained. by virtue of any order, judgment, or process, specified in section 1308: 3.

If the imprisonment or restraint be in virtue of an order, warrant, or process, a copy thereof must be annexed, or it must be alleged, that by reason of the removal or concealment of the party before the application, a demand of such copy could not be made, or such demand was made, and the legal fees therefore tendered to the person having the party in his custody, and that a copy was refused: 5. If the imprisonment be alleged to be illegal, the application must also state in what the alleged illegality consists: 6. That the legality of the imprisonment has not been already adjudged, upon a prior writ of deliverance, to the knowledge or belief of the applicant: 7. It must be verified by the oath of the applicant, to the effect, that he believes it to be true.

§ 1312. Any court or judge, empowered to grant the writ, to whom such application is presented, must grant the writ, without delay, unless it appear from the application itself, or from the documents annexed, that the person applying therefore, is, by the provisions of this chapter, prohibited from prosecuting the writ.

§ 1313. The writ of deliverance must command the defendant to produce the person imprisoned or restrained, by whatsoever name he may be called or charged, and certify and return therewith the time and cause of his imprisonment or restraint, before the supreme court, at a special term to be held at a specified time and place, or before the judge allowing the writ, or another judge as provided in the next section, at a specified, time and place, or immediately after the receipt of the, writ, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the person so imprisoned or restrained; Or when, for the reason hereinafter mentioned, the body need not be produced, the writ, instead of requiring the production of the person, may require the defendant to certify and return, the time and cause of the imprisonment or restraint.

§ 1314. If application for the writ be made to the supreme court, or a judge thereof, in a county other than that where the party is imprisoned, the writ may be made returnable before any officer authorized to grant the writ, in the county of the imprisonment.

§ 1315. The writ must not be disobeyed for any defect of form. It is sufficient, 1. If the person, having the custody of the party imprisoned or restrained, be designated either by his name of office, if he have any, or by his own name, or if both such names be unknown or uncertain, he may be described by an assumed appellation; and any one who may be served with the writ, is to be deemed the person to whom it was directed, although it may be directed to him by a wrong name or description, or to another person; 2. If the person, who is directed to be produced, be designated by name, or if his name be uncertain or unknown, he may be described in any other way, so as to designate the person intended.

§ 1316. Whenever the supreme court, or a judge thereof; has evidence from a judicial proceeding before such court or judge, that any person within the county where the court or judge may be, is illegally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, it is the duty of such court or judge to issue a writ of deliverance for his relief, although no application be made for such writ.

§ 1317. The person, on whom the writ is served, must state his return plainly and unequivocally. 1. Whether he have or have not, the party in his custody or power, or under his restraint: 2.

If the party be detained, by virtue of a writ, warrant, or other written authority, a copy thereof must be annexed to the return, and the original must be prosecuted and exhibited, on the return of the writ to the court or judge to whom the same is returnable: 4. If the person on whom the writ shall have been served, shall have had the party in his custody or power, or under his restraint, at any time prior or subsequent to the date of the writ, but has transferred such custody or restraint to another, the return must state particularly to whom, at what time, for what cause, and by what authority such transfer took place. The return must be signed by the person making the same, and, except where he is a sworn public officer, and makes his return in his official capacity, it must be verified by his oath.

§ 1318. If the writ of deliverance require it, the person or officer on whom the writ shall have been served, must also produce the person in his custody or power, according, to the command of the writ, except in the case of the sickness of such party, as provided in section 1332.

§ 1319. If the person on whom the writ shall have been duly served, refuse or neglect to obey the same, by producing the party named therein, and making a full and explicit return thereto, within the time required, and no sufficient excuse be shown therefore, it is the duty of the court or judge, before whom the writ was returnable, upon proof of the service thereof, forthwith to issue a warrant of arrest against such person, directed to the sheriff of any county within this state, and commanding him forthwith to arrest such person and to bring him before the court or judge; and on his being so brought, he must be committed to close custody, in the jail of the county, without being allowed the liberties thereof; until he makes return to the writ, and complies with any order that may be made in relation to the person, for whose relief the writ was issued.

§ 1320. If a sheriff shall have neglected to return the writ, the warrant may be directed to the coroner, or any other person designated therein, who shall have full power to execute the same; and the sheriff, upon being brought up, may be committed to the jail of any county other than his own.

§ 1321. The court or judge, by whom the warrant is issued, may also, at the same time, or afterwards, issue a precept to the sheriff, or other person to whom the warrant was directed, commanding him, to bring forthwith the party for whose benefit the writ of deliverance was granted; and he shall thereafter remain in the custody of such sheriff or person, until discharged or remanded.

§ 1322. The court or judge, before whom the party is brought, on the writ of deliverance, must immediately, alter the return thereof, examine into the facts contained in the return, and into the cause of the imprisonment or restraint of the party, whether the same shall have been upon commitment for any criminal, or supposed criminal, matter or not.

§ 1323. If no legal cause be shown for the imprisonment or restraint, or for the continuance thereof, that party must be discharged from the custody or restraint under which he is held.

§ 1324. The party, must be forthwith remanded, if it appear that he is detained in custody: 1. By virtue of process issued by a court or judge of the United States, in a case where such court or judge has exclusive jurisdiction: 2. By virtue of the judgment, of a competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or of an execution issued upon such judgment; or 3. By virtue of a warrant of commitment for a contempt, specially and plainly charged therein, and issued by a court, officer or body, having authority to commit for the contempt so charged, and 4. That the time, during which such party may be legally detained, has not expired.

§ 1325. If it appear on the return, that the party is in custody by virtue of an order or civil process, from a court legally constituted, or issued by an officer in the course of judicial proceedings before him, authorized by law, the party can be discharged in one of the following cases only: 1. Where the jurisdiction of such court or officer has Been exceeded, either as to matter, place, sum, or person: 2. Where, although the original imprisonment was lawful, yet by some subsequent act, omission, or event, the party has become entitled to his discharge: 3. Where the order or process is defective in some matter of substance required by law, rendering it void: 4. Where the order or process, though in proper form, has been issued in a case not allowed by law: 5. Where the person, having the custody of the prisoner under such order or process, is not the person empowered by law to detain him: or 6. Where the order or process is not authorized by a judgment, or order of a court, or by any provision of law.

§ 1326. But no court or judge, on the return of a writ of deliverance, has power to inquire into the legality or justice of any order, judgment, or process, specified in section 1308, nor into the justice or propriety of any commitment for a contempt, made by a court, officer, or body, according to law, and charged in such commitment, as provided in this code.

§ 1327. If it appear, that the party has been legally committed for a criminal offence, or if he appear by the testimony offered with the return, or upon the hearing thereof; to be guilty of such an offence, although the commitment be irregular, he may be forthwith remanded to the custody, or placed under the restraint, from which he was taken, if the person under whose custody or restraint he was, be legally entitled thereto; if not so entitled, he must be committed, to the custody of the officer or person so entitled.

§ 1328. Until judgment be given upon the return, the party may be either committed to the custody of the sheriff of the county or placed in such care or under such custody, as his age and other circumstances may require.

§ 1329. When it appears from the return to the writ, that the party is in custody on an order or process, under which another person has an interest in continuing his imprisonment, or restraint, no order can be made for his discharge, until the party so interested, or his attorney, has had the same notice of the return as is required to be given of motions in the supreme court.

§ 1330. When it appears from the return, that the party is detained upon a criminal accusation, the court or judge can make no order for his discharge until sufficient notice of the return is given to the district attorney of the county, where the party is detained.

§ 1331. The party produced, on the return of a writ of deliverance, may deny any of the material facts set forth in the return, or may allege any fact, to show, either that his imprisonment or restraint is unlawful, or that he is entitled to his discharge; which allegation or denial must be on oath; and, thereupon, the court or judge must proceed in a summary way, to hear such evidence as may be produced, in support of the imprisonment or detention, or against the same, and to dispose of the party, as the justice of the case may require.

§ 1332. Whenever, from the sickness or infirmity of the party, he cannot, without danger, be produced, the person in whose custody he is, may state that fact in his return to the writ, verifying the same by his oath; and if satisfied of the truth of the allegation, and the return be otherwise sufficient, the court or judge must proceed to decide on the return, and to dispose of the matter in the same manner, as if the party had been produced.

§ 1333. Whenever an application is made for a writ of deliverance, according to the provisions of this chapter, if it appear, upon the face of the application, that the cause, or offence, for which the person is imprisoned or restrained, is not bailable, the production of the party, may be dispensed with though such production be asked, and the writ be issued accordingly.

§ 1334. If it appear, that the party detained is illegally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, judgment must be given that he be forthwith discharged: otherwise the application must be dismissed.

§ 1335. Notwithstanding the issuing of the writ of deliverance without requiring the production of the person, the court or judge before whom the same was returnable, may, before final decision, issue a new writ, requiring the production of the person.

§ l336. Obedience to a judgment, for the discharge of a person restrained of his liberty, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the court or judge, by proceedings for a contempt, in the same manner, and with the same effect, as for a neglect to make return to a writ of deliverance; and the person found guilty of such disobedience, shall forfeit to the party aggrieved, one thousand dollars, in addition to any special damages which he may have sustained.

§ 1337. No sheriff or other officer is liable to a civil action, for obeying such judgment of discharge.

§ 1338. No person who has been discharged, upon a writ of deliverance, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, can be again imprisoned, restrained, or kept in custody, for the same cause; but it is not to be deemed the same cause. 1. If he have been discharged from a commitment on a criminal charge, and be afterwards committed for the same offence, by the legal order or process of the court, wherein he is bound, by recognizance or undertaking, to appear, or in which he is indicted or convicted for the same offence: or, 2. If, after a discharge for a defect of evidence, or for a material defect in the commitment, in a criminal case, the party be again arrested, on sufficient evidence, and committed by legal process, for the same offence: or, 3; If, in a civil action, the party have been discharged for any illegality in the judgment or process, herein before specified, and be afterwards imprisoned by legal authority, for the same cause of action: or, 4. If, in a civil action, he have been discharged from commitment on an order of arrest, and be afterwards committed on execution, in the same action, or on an order of arrest in another action, after such first action has been dismissed.

§ 1339. If any person, either solely or as a member of a court, in the execution of a judgment, order, or process, knowingly recommit, imprison, or restrain of his liberty, for the same cause, except as provided in the last section, any person so discharged, or knowingly direct or assist therein, he shall forfeit to the party aggrieved one thousand dollars, and be also guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1340. Any person having in his custody or power, or under his restraint, a party, who, by the provisions of this chapter, would be entitled to a writ of deliverance or for whose relief a writ of deliverance has been issued, who, with intent to elude the service of the writ, or to avoid the effect thereof, transfers the party to the custody, or places him under the power or control, of another, or conceals or changes the place of his confinement, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1341. Every person who knowingly assists, in the violation of the last section, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1342. Every person, convicted of an offence under either of the last four sections, may be punished by fine and imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court, in which he is convicted; but such fine cannot exceed one thousand dollars, nor such imprisonment six months.

§ 1343. Whenever it appears by satisfactory evidence that any person is held in illegal confinement, and that there is reason to believe, that he will be carried out of the state, or suffer irreparable injury before he can be relieved, by the issuing of a writ of deliverance, any court or judge, authorized to issue such writ, may issue a warrant, directed to any sheriff, constable or other person, reciting the facts, and commanding such officer or person to take the party and forthwith to bring him before the court or judge.

§ 1344. When the evidence, mentioned in the last section, is also sufficient to justify an arrest of the person having the party in his custody, as for a criminal offence committed in the taking or detaining of the party, the warrant must also contain an order for the arrest of such person for the offence.

§ 1345. Any officer or person, to whom the warrant is directed, must execute the same, by bringing the prisoner therein named, and the person who detains him, if so commanded by the warrant, before the court or judge issuing it ; and thereupon the person, detaining the party, must make a return in the same manner, and the same proceedings must be had thereon as if a writ of deliverance had been issued in the first instance.

§ 1346. If the person, having the party in his custody; be brought before the court or judge, as for a criminal offence, he must be examined, committed, bailed or discharged, by the court or judge in the same manner as in other criminal cases of the like nature.

§ 1347. Any officer or other person refusing to deliver a copy of an order, warrant, process, or other authority, by which he detains a person, to any one who demands it, and tenders the fees therefore, shall forfeit two hundred dollars to the person so detained.

§ 1348. Whenever a writ of deliverance is required, in any action or matter, civil or criminal, to which the people of this state are a party, the application therefore may be made by the attorney general, or by the district attorney having charge thereof, and whenever so issued, the court or judge allowing it, must state in the endorsement of the allowance, that it was issued on such application.

§ 1349. A writ of deliverance must be served by an elector of this state, and the service thereof is not deemed complete, unless the person, serving it, tenders to the person, in whose custody the prisoner may be, if such person be a sheriff; coroner, constable or marshal the fees allowed by law for bringing up the party, nor unless he also give an undertaking to such officer, to the effect that the charges of carrying back the party if remanded, shall be paid, and that he shall not escape by the way, either in going to or returning from the place to which he is to be taken. But this section does not apply to a case, where the writ is issued on the application of the attorney general, or by the district attorney.

§ 1350. The writ of deliverance may be served, by delivering the same to the person to whom it is directed, or if he cannot be found, by leaving it at the jail, or other place, in which the party is confined, with any under officer or other person of proper age, having charge for the time, of such party.

§ 1351. If the person, on whom the writ ought to be served, conceal himself, or refuse admittance to the person attempting to serve it, it may be served by affixing it, or a copy thereof, in some conspicuous place on the outside, either of his dwelling house, or of the place where the party is confined.

§ 1352. It is the duty of every sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, upon whom a writ of deliverance has been served, whether such writ be directed to him or not, upon payment or tender of the fees allowed by law, and the delivery or tender of the undertaking herein prescribed, to obey and return the writ, according to the exigency thereof; and it is the duty of every other person, upon whom the writ is served, having the custody of the person, for whose benefit it is issued, to obey and return it according to the command thereof, without requiring any undertaking, or the payment of any fees, unless the payment of such fees has been required by the judge issuing the writ.

§ 1353. Every judge, allowing a writ of deliverance directed to a person other than a sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, may, in his discretion, require in order to render the service effectual, that the charges of bringing up party, be paid by the applicant; and in such case he must, in the allowance of the writ, specify the amount of such charges, which cannot exceed the fees allowed by law to sheriffs for similar services.

§ 1354. If the writ be returnable at a certain time, such return must be made, and the party produced, at the time and place specified therein; if it be returnable forthwith, and the place be within twenty miles of the place of service, the return must be made and the party produced within twenty-four hours, and the same time is allowed for every additional twenty miles.

§ 1355. No question once finally adjudged upon a writ of deliverance, can be re-examined upon a subsequent writ of deliverance.

§ 1375. If the complaint be against the endorser of a promissory note, or the drawer or endorser of a draft or bill of exchange, there must also be annexed to the complaint an original notarial certificate, showing the due presentment of the note, draft, or bill of exchange to the maker or acceptor thereof, and due notice of nonpayment to the defendant, or a written waiver by the defendant of the presentment and notice.

§ 1383. Such attachment must be issued and executed in the same manner as attachments issued pursuant to the chapter on attachment, and all the provisions of that chapter, apply to the attachment issued, under section 1381.

In all other cases the foreclosure of mortgages of real property, must be by action; and nothing in this section takes away the right of a party to foreclose by action in every case, at his option.

§ 1385. A notice that the mortgage will be foreclosed and the property therein described sold, must be given, as hereinafter prescribed, and must specify, 1. The names of the mortgagor and mortgagee, and of the several assignees, if any: 2. The date of the mortgage, the county where, and the time when it was recorded: 3. The amount due thereon, at the time of the first publication thereof and if the whole be not then due, the amount of principal to become due thereafter: 4. A description of the mortgaged property, conforming substantially to that contained in the mortgage: 5. The time and place of sale, specifying the day and hour, the town, city, or village and the particular house or place therein. The notice must be subscribed with the name of the party who is the owner of the mortgage, or to whom the payment is due, in respect to which default has been made.

§ 1386. The notice must be published and served as follows : 1. By publishing the same for six weeks successively, once in each week, in a newspaper printed and published in the county where the property, or some part thereof, is situated; if the property lie in a city or village, and a newspaper be published therein, the publication to be made in such a paper: 2. By serving a copy of the notice on the mortgagor, and on persons having an interest or lien in the mortgaged premises, subsequent to the mortgage, or their personal representatives, by delivery in the manner of serving a summons in a civil action; or, if the person upon whom the service is to be made, does not reside in this state, or cannot on due diligence be found therein, but his place of residence is known, or can on diligent inquiry be ascertained, by delivery thereof to some person of suitable age and discretion, at the dwelling house of such persons respectively, or by depositing the same in the post office properly enveloped and addressed to such persons, at their several places of residence ; the service in all cases to be at least three weeks before the time appointed for the sale: 3. By posting copies of the notice in three public places of the town, city or village where the property, or some portion thereof is situated, at least five weeks before the time specified therein for the sale.

§ 1387. At the time and place specified in the notice, the sale may be postponed on the request of any person claiming an interest in the premises, or for want of bidders, by a public announcement of the postponement, and publishing notice thereof; as soon as practicable, in the same newspaper, at the foot of the original notice, specifying the time and place to which the postponement is made, and continuing the notice until the time appointed therein for the sale. It may be again postponed, and from time to time in the same manner, but no costs or fees for making such postponement, or publishing or continuing the notice, can be a charge on the mortgaged property.

§ 1388. The sheriff of the county must, upon request, attend either in person or by deputy, at the time and place of sale, to superintend the sale, and to receive and keep the money or securities paid or deposited thereon.

§ 1389. The sale must be by public auction, between the hours of nine in the forenoon, and four in the afternoon. If the mortgaged property be situated in a city or village, the sale must be therein, otherwise it may be in any part of the county where the property lies. If the property be a farm, or distinct lot, lying partly in two or more counties, the sale must be in the county where the mansion house, or chief building on the property is situated, or if there be none, or two or more in different counties, the sale may be in either county. If the property consist of distinct farms or parcels, they must be sold separately, but when a part has been sold for sufficient to satisfy the amount due and costs, another parcel cannot be sold.

§ 1390. Immediately after the last parcel is struck off, the sheriff or auctioneer must give public notice of the time and place at which application will be made to a judge to confirm the sale, which time must be not less than three nor more than ten days thereafter.

§ 1391. The mortgagee, or his assignee, may prescribe the terms of sale, and may give time for the payment of the whole or part of the purchase money due him, and may become the purchaser on such sale. IN place of payment of the purchase money to the sheriff, the purchaser may deliver to him the receipt of the owner of the mortgage therefore, to the extent of the amount due him thereon, which receipt must be returned with the papers to the judge, on the application for confirmation. The sheriff, and his sureties, shall be responsible for all moneys paid to him on such sale, in the same manner as for money collected on execution, and he must dispose of such money as the judge may direct.

§ 1392. Upon the application for confirmation, there must be produced before the judge the original mortgage, and any bond or collateral contract for the payment of the same money, or proof of their loss or destruction, together with evidence: 1. Of the amount due on the mortgage at the time of the sale, after allowing all payments thereon: 2. Of the publication, service and posting of notices, as provided in sections 1385 and 1386, and every postponement, and notice thereof, and its publication, as provided in section 1387, and also the service of the copies of the notice, specifying upon whom, and when and how made: 3. That the property was fairly sold to the highest bidder, by public auction, at the time and place specified in the notice of sale or postponement, specifying the several parcels sold, the person to whom sold, the amount at which each parcel was struck off, and the order in which they were sold, the amount paid by such purchaser, and the receipt, if any, given by the holder of the mortgage, and the fact, that notice was publicly given of application for the confirmation, at a specified time and place.

§ 1393. The proof mentioned in subdivisions one and two of the last section, must be by affidavit of the party foreclosing: that of publication, by affidavit of the printer of the newspaper, or his foreman: that of posting and serving notices, and of postponing the sale, by affidavit of the person who performed the service; or if made by any other person, reasons satisfactory to the judge, why they were not made by the persons above designated, must be shown in the affidavits.

§ 1394. Upon the application for confirmation, or upon a day to which it may be adjourned, the judge, may correct any error that may appear in the statement of the amount due on the mortgage; and for that purpose may examine witnesses, or receive other evidence. If it appear to his satisfaction, by the evidence, and by inspection of the mortgage, or other collateral contract, that the holder was entitled to foreclose by reason of default in payment, and that all the proceedings have been in conformity with this chapter, he must confirm the foreclosure and sale, by an order indorsed on or attached to, the affidavits or certificate and to be filed and recorded therewith in the office of the county clerk.

§ 1395. The order of confirmation must show 1. The names of all the persons upon whom it appears that the notice was duly served: 2. The amount due, and the amount of costs to which the party foreclosing is entitled: 3. The whole amount for which the property was sold, stating the surplus, if any, or the deficiency, if any, remaining due on the mortgage, and unsatisfied by the sale: 4. If there be payments to become due, unsatisfied by the sale, and also other property mortgaged and not sold, it must be so stated: 5. It must direct that the foreclosure and sale be confirmed, and that the evidence with the order, be filed and recorded.

§ 1396. If the evidence be defective it may be amended or supplied. If it appear, that one or more parcels were sold, after a sum had been raised sufficient to satisfy the amount due with costs, the sale as to those parcels may be vacated, and in other respects confirmed. The omission to serve notice on persons other than the mortgagor, and his personal representatives, shall not affect the validity of the foreclosure and sale, in respect to the persons upon whom the notice was served. But a sale not confirmed as provided in this chapter is void, any money paid thereon must be restored, and the judge by order may enforce the restoration.

§ 1397. When a person, upon whom notice is required to be served, as provided in section 1386, cannot be found, and his place of residence is unknown, and cannot on diligent inquiry be ascertained, and that fact is upon the application, to confirm the sale, made to appear, by affidavit, to the satisfaction of the judge, the publication and posting of the notice, shall, be deemed, a good service on such person and his name must be inserted in the order of confirmation accordingly.

§ 1398. The evidence with the order endorsed or attached, must be filed and recorded at length in the office of the clerk of the county, where the land was sold, and thereupon operates as a conveyance of the title of both the mortgagor and mortgagee to the purchaser, and, as a foreclosure of the equity of redemption of every person, upon whom the notice was served as determined in the order of confirmation, whose interest is derived from the mortgagor subsequent to the mortgage, or from a lien attached since that time.

§ 1399. The right of a party to enforce or foreclose a mortgage, as provided in this chapter, or the validity of the mortgage, or the amount due thereon, may be contested by action, brought at any time before the sale in favor of any party interested, against any party who may attempt or threaten such foreclosure. In such action proceedings on the summary foreclosure may be stayed by injunction on such terms, as the court may direct, and in the action the court may complete the foreclosure, or not, in its discretion.

§ 1400. At any time prior to the sale, any person having an interest or lien upon the property, subsequent to the mortgage, may assume the same, by paying to the holder the amount secured and interest, with the costs already incurred, together with the amount of any lien of the same holder subsequent to the mortgage, and prior to that of the person offering to assume it; and he shall thereupon be entitled to an assignment of the mortgage and of such subsequent lien, and may proceed in the foreclosure or discontinue it, at his option.

§ 1401. Upon the application to confirm the sale, or at such other time as the judge may then appoint, he must proceed to determine in a summary manner, the right of any person entitled to an interest in surplus money arising on a sale. He must also make such order as may be necessary for the disposition of any money in the sheriff’s hands. His orders in the case may be enforced in the same manner as orders in actions, and disobedience thereof may be punished in the same manner.

§ 1402. The order of a judge respecting the payment or distribution of money arising upon the sale of mortgaged property, pursuant to this chapter, is subject to appeal to the supreme court, in the same manner as an order refusing a state writ.

§ 1403. When a part of the money secured by the mortgage only is due, and part of the property remains unsold, the mortgage may, for any subsequent default, be again foreclosed, as to the remainder of such property, and a sale thereof made as at first.

§ 1404. When there is a surplus, arising on the sale, beyond the amount due, with costs, and there remains a sum, secured by the mortgage, yet to become due, the holder of the mortgage is entitled to receive such surplus, to be applied to the amount next to become due, the proper rebate of interest being made. If he refuse to receive the surplus, it may, by order of the judge be paid to the person next entitled.

§ 1405. Mortgages to the people of the state, may be foreclosed as provided in this chapter.

§ 1406. The costs of summary foreclosure, pursuant to this chapter, and to be retained out of the proceeds of the sale, are as follows: 1. The printer’s fees allowed by law for publishing notices; 2. The clerk’s fees allowed by law for necessary searches to ascertain interests and liens subsequent to the mortgage; 3. For posting and filing notices, one dollar; 4. For service, otherwise than through the post office, of a copy of notice on the mortgagor and other persons, not exceeding five, one dollar each; for all over five, fifty cents each: 5. For service on each person served only through the post office, twenty-five cents: 6. For all other services, prior to the day of sale, five dollars: 7. For attending the sale, and all services to the day of application for confirmation, five dollars: 8. For attending the judge for confirmation, and all subsequent services, five dollars; 9. The clerk’s fees allowed by law for recording evidence and order of confirmation; 10. Sheriff’s fees upon the sale, for the first parcel sold, three dollars; for every subsequent parcel, separately sold, one dollar; for attending before the judge on the application for confirmation with money received on the sale, two dollars; and for all money actually received by him on the sale and paid over, one-half of one per cent.

§ 1411. A complaint must be made, and verified, as in an action, stating plainly and concisely the facts necessary to establish the rights of the plaintiff, and thereupon either, 1. A copy of the complaint must be served upon-the defendant, with a notice from the plaintiff that unless the defendant previously surrender to the plaintiff possession of the premises, application will, at a specified time and place, be made to a justice of the town or a justices’ district where the property is situated, for a warrant of possession in favor of the plaintiff; or, 2. The complaint must be delivered to such justice, who shall make an order, requiring the defendant to surrender possession of the property to the plaintiff, or show cause before the justice, at a specified place and time, why a warrant of possession should not be issued in favor of the plaintiff.

§ 1412. The notice or order, with a copy of the complaint must be served by a sheriff or constable at least two days before the day of appearance, either, 1.

The officer must make a return certifying the time and manner of service.

§ 1413. If at the time appointed, the defendant do not appear and defend, the justice upon production of the complaint, and a certificate of service of a copy thereof and of the notice or order, must give judgment that the defendant be removed from the property, and the plaintiff be put into the possession thereof.

§ 1414. The defendant may at the time for appearance, make and deliver to the judge an answer to the complaint, verified as in an action, denying any of the material allegations, thereof; or alleging any defense he may have.

§ 1415. The questions arising on the complaint and answer must be tried by the justice, or, if either party demand it, a jury must be summoned to try the question of fact, if any.

§ 1416. If the justice find, or the verdict of the jury be rendered, in favor of the plaintiff, the justice must give judgment, that the defendant be removed from the property, describing it, and the plaintiff put in the possession thereof, and also that the defendant pay the costs specified in the order.

§ 1417. For the execution of a judgment of removal a warrant must be signed by the justice and delivered to the sheriff of the county, or to the marshal or constable of the city or town in which the property is situated, commanding him to remove the defendant from the property, and put the plaintiff into possession thereof; and to collect the costs of the proceedings specified in the warrant. The officer to whom the warrant is directed and delivered, must execute the same as prescribed in section 1426, and must collect the costs in the same manner, as upon a judgment in a justice’s court.

§ 1418. Upon the request of either party, the justice may adjourn the trial, for the purpose of enabling such party to procure his witnesses, whenever it appears to be necessary, and due diligence has been already used; but such adjournment cannot, without the consent of both parties, exceed ten days in the whole.

§ 1419. When a warrant is issued for the removal of a tenant, the contract under which he holds, if any, is thenceforth terminated, and the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties, ceases, except as provided in section 1422.

§ 1420. The tenant can stay the issuing of the warrant, when the application grows out of the failure to pay rent, if; before the warrant be actually issued, he pay the rent due, with costs, or give to the landlord security, approved by the justice, for the payment thereof in ten days.

§ 1421. Proceedings must be stayed, when the application grows out of a sale by execution or foreclosure of a mortgage, if, at any time before the issuing of the warrant, the occupant: 1. Pay the costs of the proceedings: 2. File with the justice an affidavit, that he claims the possession of the property, by virtue of a title acquired after the sale, which defeats the plaintiff’s right of possession, or that he claims as guardian or trustee of another not made a defendant: and 3. Deliver to the plaintiff an undertaking, with sureties approved by the justice, to the effect, that he will commit no waste during his occupancy of the property, and that if an action be brought by the plaintiff, within three months, for the recovery of the possession thereof, he will pay the costs, and such damages as may be recovered therein for withholding the possession.

§ 1422. When the application is under the second subdivision of section 1410, if the unexpired term of the lease, under which the property is held, exceed one year at the time of issuing the warrant, and the notice or order was not personally served upon the tenant, he, or his successor in interest, or one having a lien upon the property, may, within sixty days after the execution of the warrant, pay or tender to the lessor or his successor in interest, or to the justice, the rent in arrear to that time, with interest and costs, and thereupon the premises must be restored to the tenant, or his successor in interest, who shall hold the same according to the terms of the original lease.

§ 1423. The warrant cannot issue until twenty-four hours after the judgment of removal, and daring that time the defendant may appeal from the judgment. The appeal must be made, in the same manner, and to the same court, as from a justice’s judgment, and the proceedings upon the appeal are the same.

§ 1424. If the appellant desire a stay of the proceedings, he must give security, by an undertaking executed by one or more sureties, approved by the justice or the county judge, to the effect, that if judgment be affirmed, the appellant will obey the judgment of removal, pay the value of the use of the property during the appeal, the costs specified in the warrant, and the costs of the appeal.

§ 1425. Upon, an affidavit that the defendant is the tenant of another under a subsisting lease, the landlord may defend the proceeding either with or without the tenant.

§ 1426. A warrant of removal can only be executed in the day time. The officer must execute it, by removing the defendant and any other person occupying by his permission, any part of the property, as his tenant or otherwise, and putting the plaintiff into possession. But when the premises are underlet, the under-tenant can not be removed, unless the summons has either been served upon him or posted in a conspicuous place on the property.

§ 1427. The justice must make an entry, in his docket, of the proceedings, and such entry is evidence thereof.

§ 1428. Upon the conviction of a defendant on an indictment, for forcible entry or forcible detention, in a court of sessions or a court of oyer and terminer, the court may award restitution, in the same manner as a justice upon a verdict pursuant to this chapter.

TITLE III. OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LIENS.

Liens in general.
Liens on buildings.
Liens on vessels.
Liens on cargoes for warfage.
Liens on things doing damage upon real property.
General provisions.

CHAPTER I. LIENS IN GENERAL.

Definition of liens.
Different kinds of liens.

§ 1429. A lien is a right to have satisfaction of a claim out of a particular thing, or to retain possession of it until the claim is paid.

§ 1430. The liens, of which the enforcement is provided in this title, are of four kinds: 1. Liens on buildings: 2. Liens on vessels: 3. Liens on cargoes for warfage: 4. Liens on things doing damage upon real property.

CHAPTER II. LIENS ON BUILDINGS.

Liens on buildings.
Limit of aggregate of liens.
Lien to be described and registered with county clerk.
Registry, how made, and its effect.
Manner of discharging lien.
Summary proceeding to settle liens.
Judgment to be given thereon.
Actions to enforce liens.

§ 1431. A person who, under the authority of the owner, performs labor, or supplies materials, towards the erection, alteration, or repair of a building, in a city or incorporated village of this state, may create a lien on the building and on the interest of the owner in the lot of land upon which it stands, for the price or value of such labor or materials, as provided in this chapter.

§ 1432. The aggregate of such liens cannot exceed the amount, which the owner of the building would be otherwise liable to pay, for such erection, alteration or repair.

§ 1433. The lien must be registered with the clerk of the county where the building is situated, or in the city of New-York, with the register of that city and county, as follows: The claimant must deliver to the clerk a statement in writing, verified by affidavit, setting forth briefly the following particulars: 1. The situation of the building, designating it by the street on which it is situated, and the number of the lot, if the street be named, and the lot numbered, or otherwise by some certain or known designation: 2. The owner of the building, under whose authority the lien was created: 3. The particulars of the claim and the amount thereof, which amount, if the claim he made before the labor has been performed, or the material supplied, and the amount payable therefore has become due, must be the amount payable by the terms of the contract with the claimant, or capable of being ascertained therefrom by computation, if afterwards, the amount actually due: and, 4. A copy of the contract with the claimant, if it be in writing, and if not in writing, a statement of its substance.

§ 1434. The clerk must thereupon register the lien in a book to be kept by him for that purpose, called the “book of liens.” The entries must be arranged alphabetically, under the name, of the owner, and of the street, separately. It must contain the name of the claimant and of the person against whom the claim exists, the amount of the lien, the time when filed, and a brief description of the property. A copy of the statement must be served on the owner, by delivering it to him personally, or by leaving it at his residence with a person of suitable age and discretion, or by depositing it in the post office, directed to him at his place of residence. From the time of filing the statement, and serving the copy, the claimant shall have a lien on the land and building, for the amount then actually due to him for work and materials, or which afterwards becomes due, pursuant to the contract referred to in the statement; but such statement must be made and filed, before the expiration of thirty days after the completion of the work or the supply of the materials.

§ 1435. The lien may be discharged, as follows: 1. By filing a certificate of the claimant or his successor in interest, acknowledged or proved in the same manner as the satisfaction of a mortgage, stating that the lien is discharged: or 2. By the deposit with the clerk, of a sum of money equal to the amount claimed, which money shall thereupon be held subject to the lien: or 3. By an entry of the clerk, made in the book of liens, after one year has elapsed since the filing of the claim, stating that no notice has been given to him of legal steps to enforce the lien: or 4. By a notice from the owner to the claimant, after the amount has become payable, requiring him to commence an action, for the enforcement of his lien, and the lapse of thirty days thereafter, without the commencement of such action: or 5. By satisfaction of the lien, upon an action for the enforcement thereof.

§ 1436. After the registry of a lien, and the performance of the work, or the supply of the materials, the claimant or the owner may either serve personally upon the other, a notice in writing, requiring him to appear before a justice of the peace of the county, at a specified time, not less than five days from the time of service, and submit to an accounting for the amount due for such labor or materials. At the time mentioned in the notice, or at such other time as the accounting may be adjourned to, the parties appearing must each deliver to the justice, an account in writing of his claim or offset, if any, verified by affidavit, and submit to examination thereupon, under the direction of the justice. If both parties appear, and there arise a question of fact, a jury may be demanded by either, and such question must be tried by a jury in the same manner, as an issue joined in an ordinary action in a justice’s court. In like manner, a contractor, that is a person who contracts with the owner for labor and materials, and who employs persons under him to do work, or furnish materials, may serve on such persons, and receive from them a similar notice with the like effect; and a payment made by the owner, to a person employed by a contractor must be allowed by such contractor, in his account with the owner, to the extent of any judgment which may be recovered by such person against such contractor, pursuant to this section.

§ 1437. Upon the accounting mentioned in the last section, whether a jury be called or not, witnesses may be produced by either party, and judgment must be rendered upon the amount found by the jury or the justice; which judgment has the same effect, is subject to appeal, and may be enforced in the same manner, as a judgment in an ordinary action in a justice’s court.

§ 1438. After the performance of the work, or the supply of the materials, and the expiration of any credit stipulated for the payment, the lien mentioned in this chapter may be enforced, by an action. In such action, all persons whose liens are registered, as provided in section 1433, may be made parties, and the court may, by the judgment, direct a sale of the land and building for the satisfaction of the liens and costs; such sale to be without prejudice to the rights of any prior encumbrancer, owner or other persons not parties to the action. If several such actions be brought by different claimants, and be pending at the same time, the court may order them to be consolidated into one.

CHAPTER III. LIENS ON VESSELS.

Liens on vessels allowed, cases specified.
Manner of enforcing liens.
All persons having an interest to be parties.
Summons, its contents and service.
Vessels may be attached.
Several actions may be consolidated.
Vessels under seizure by United States, exempt.

§ 1439. A debt, amounting to at least fifty dollars, contracted in this state by the owner, master, agent or consignee of a vessel, is a lien upon the vessel, her tackle, apparel and furniture, when contracted for either of the following purposes: 1. Work done, or materials furnished in this state. towards the building, repairing, equipping and furnishing thereof: 2. Provisions and stores furnished in this state, proper for the use of the vessel at the time they were furnished: 3. Wharfage and keeping the vessel in port, including the expense of employing persons to watch her. This lien has preference over every other lien, except for mariners’ wages. But it ceases in twelve days after the vessel leaves the port where the debt was contracted for another place in this state, and immediately upon her leaving this state: 4. Damage, occasioned to a vessel by collision with another, through the negligence or willful misconduct of its navigator, if it exceed fifty dollars, is also for thirty days after the collision, a lien upon the vessel doing the injury.

§ 1440. The lien mentioned in the last section, may Be enforced by an action; in which the court may order the sale of the vessel and the tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, or the tackle, apparel and furniture alone, and the application of the proceeds for the purpose of satisfying the liens thereon. Upon a judgment of sale, the sale must be made by the sheriff, and his bill of sale, made in pursuance thereof, vests in the purchaser a valid title to the property sold, as against all the parties to the action.

§ 1441. Every person having an interest in or lien upon the vessel whose name is known to the plaintiff, must be made by name, a party to the action, either as plaintiff or defendant, and all other persons having such interest or lien, are to be deemed parties defendants.

§ 1442. The summons must be directed by name to the known defendants, and generally to all other persons unknown having an interest in the vessel or a lien thereon, and must contain a brief description of the vessel, stating, if contained in the complaint, its name, the port to which it belongs, the name of its last commander, and briefly the object of the action. The summons must be served upon the defendants named therein as prescribed in section 628, and upon the unknown defendants as prescribed in sections 629 and 630.

§ 1443. In such action, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, may have the vessel attached as a security for the satisfaction of such liens as shall thereon be adjudged valid. The mode of proceeding to obtain such attachment, to execute and discharge it, is the same as upon the ordinary provisional remedy by attachment.

§ 1444. If several such actions be brought by different persons having liens upon the same vessel and be pending at the same time, the court may order them to be consolidated into one.

§ 1445. No proceeding under this chapter can be had against a vessel which shall have been seized by virtue of process from a court of the United States, having admiralty jurisdiction, while such vessel is actually held under such seizure, nor against a vessel which shall have been sold by order of such court, except for debts contracted after the sale. But nothing in ‘bi’ section impairs the validity of any lien created by this chapter, the payment of which shall be decreed by a court of the United States.

CHAPTER IV. LIENS ON CARGOES FOR WHARFAGE.

Lien for wharfage, when.
Notice to be given.
Appraisement to be made.

§ 1446. When a vessel has lain twenty-four hours at a wharf in this state, for which wharfage is due, and the same has been demanded of the master or owner, by notice left on board with one of the company of the vessel, and neither payment is made nor security given therefore, the owner of the wharf may distrain any chattels on board the vessel for the amount; and so, from time to time as often as twenty-four hour’s wharfage becomes due. The distress must be made by a constable or marshal.

§ 1447. The officer making the distress, must immediately give notice thereof, with the cause of the distress, the amount of wharfage due, and an inventory of the property taken, by leaving it on board with one of the company of the vessel.

§ 1448. If, at the expiration of five days after the notice, the wharfage due, with the costs of the distress, be not paid, and the property distrained, be not legally reclaimed, the officer must summon two disinterested householders, who shall be sworn by him, fairly to appraise the property distrained. They must thereupon make and certify the appraisement.

§ 1449. The officer must, thereupon, give six days public notice of the sale of the property distrained, by affixing it on a conspicuous part of the wharf for which the wharfage was due, and also in two public places in the town or ward. On the day and at the place appointed, he must sell the property by public auction, and apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of the wharfage due, and costs, and pay the surplus, if any, to the owner of the property.

§ 1451. A distress is the taking of personal property into the custody of a party by his own act, without legal process, for the enforcement of a lien.

§ 1452. When a distress is made, the distrainer must keep the property safely, until the appraisement of his damage, and, within twenty-four hours after the distress, unless it was made on a Saturday, and then before the Tuesday morning thereafter, he must apply to two fence viewers of the town to make the appraisement.

§ 1453. The fence viewers must immediately repair to the place, view the damage, and thereupon ascertain and certify the amount thereof, with their fees. They must also determine any dispute which may arise, respecting the sufficiency of a fence around the property, where the damage was done, and may take the testimony of witnesses, and for that purpose may administer oaths.

§ 1454. When the distress is of beasts, and the damage and fees are not paid, the distrainer, within twenty-four hours after the appraisement must cause the beasts distrained to be put into the nearest pound in the city or town, if there be one, there to remain till the payment of the damages and fees, or the sale of the boasts as prescribed in section 1462, or until the beats are legally reclaimed.

While the beasts remain in the pound their owner may feed them without disturbance. From the proceeds of the sale the pound master, after deducting the amount of his fees and charges of keeping the beasts, and the charges of sale, must pay to the distrainer the damages so certified, with the fees of the fence viewers, and the surplus, if any, to the owner of the beasts. If no owner appear to claim the surplus, within a year after the sale, it must be paid to the overseers of the poor of the city or town for the use of the poor.

§ 1456. A pound master, with whom beasts are impounded, must discharge them, on being paid: 1. The amount of damage certified by the fence viewers: 2. The fees of the fence viewers: 3. The, fees of the pound master, with his reasonable charge for feeding the beasts, if fed by him, not exceeding six cents for each beast every twenty-four hours, and 4. In the city of New-York fifty cents a day each, for every day they remain in the pound.

§ 1457. When distress is made of inanimate things doing damage, or, when distress is made of beasts and there is no pound in the city or town, the distrainer must keep the things or beasts in a safe and convenient place, until the damage is appraised, and they are sold or otherwise disposed of.

§ 1458. In the cases provided for in the last section, the distrainer must affix a notice in three public places of the town six days before the sale, as follows: 1. Specifying the property distrained, and the amount of damage certified: 2. Requiring the owner of the property to redeem, and remove it, before the day appointed for the sale: 3. Stating that the property will be sold at a specified time and place, to pay the damage and the charges of the proceedings.

§ 1459. If the value of the property distrained, as certified by the appraisers, exceed fifty dollars, the distrainer must also publish a similar notice, in the nearest newspaper, once a week for four weeks, but in such case, the time of sale must be at least thirty days from the first publication of the notice.

§ 1460. If the owner of the property be known to the distrainer, or if any person be known to him as claiming an interest therein, and such owner or person be found or reside within the county, the distrainer must also serve a copy of the notice, at least six days before the sale, either personally on such owner or person, or in case of his absence from his last place of residence, by leaving the same at such residence with a person of suitable age and discretion ; or if the owner or claimant reside out of the county and his residence be known, and he be not served personally, by sending a copy of the notice by mail, properly enveloped, to his address.

§ 1461. If the property be not removed, and the damage so certified, with the fees of the appraisers and the expense of the notice, be not paid at the time appointed for the sale, the distrainer must apply to the sheriff of the county or a constable of the town, to sell the property, and for that purpose must deliver to the officer the original certificate of the appraisers, and an affidavit, showing his compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 1462. The officer must thereupon sell the property in the same manner as on execution against personal property in civil actions, and out of the proceeds of the sale, after deducting his own fees, pay to the distrainer the amount of the damage certified, the expense of the notice and also all other expense, that may have been reasonably incurred in the safe keeping and preservation of the property, to be ascertained and certified by the county judge, or by a justice of the peace of the county, and the balance, if any, pay to the owner of the property; or if he be unknown, to the county treasurer for the owner, to be paid to him upon the order of the county court upon making application and proof of property.

§ 1463. If upon such application, the court entertain a doubt of the ownership of the property, it may, before ordering the payment require the claimant to execute an undertaking, with sureties to be approved by the court, to the effect, that he will pay the amount established, to any person, who, in an action on such undertaking, commenced within two years from its date, shall establish his right to such balance, or any part thereof; and any person claiming such balance, or any part thereof; may prosecute the undertaking.

§ 1468. Every court of justice, except a court of conciliation, and every judicial officer, has power to punish contempts by fine or imprisonment, or both. But when the contempt, is not one of those mentioned in the first or second subdivisions of the last section, or in the first subdivision of section 228, it must appear that the right or remedy of a party to an action, or special proceeding, was defeated or prejudiced thereby, before the contempt can be punished by imprisonment, or by a fine exceeding fifty dollars. Contempts of justices’ courts are punishable in the manner provided by sections 1150, 1151, 1152, 1153, and 1154.

§ 1469.

If the party charged be in the custody of an officer, by virtue of a legal order or process, civil or criminal, except upon a sentence for felony, an order may be made for the production of such person by the officer having him in custody, that he may answer, and he shall thereupon be produced and held until an order be made for his disposal.

§ 1472. Whenever a warrant of arrest is issued, pursuant to this chapter, the court or officer must direct, whether the person charged may be let to bail for his appearance upon the warrant, or detained in custody without bail, and if he may be hailed, the amount in which he may be let to bail. The directions given in this respect, must be specified in the warrant.

§ 1473. Upon executing the warrant of arrest, the sheriff must keep the person in actual custody, bring him before the court or officer, and detain him until an order be made in the premises, unless the person arrested entitle himself to be discharged, as provided in the next section.

When the warrant contains the direction to let the person arrested to bail, he must be discharged from the arrest, upon executing and delivering to the officer, at any time before the return day of the warrant, a written undertaking, with two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the person arrested will appear on the return of the warrant, and abide the order of the court or officer thereupon, or pay, as may be directed, the sum specified in the warrant.

§ 1475. The officer must return the warrant of arrest, and the undertaking, if any, received by him from the person arrested, by the return day specified therein. If he fail to make the return, a, warrant of arrest not bailable may be issued against him, specifying therein the cause of issuing it.

§ 1476. The officer to whom the warrant mentioned in the last section is delivered, must execute it, by arresting the person proceeded against, bringing him personally before the court or officer, and detaining him in custody until otherwise ordered.

§ 1477. When the person arrested has been brought up, or appeared, the court or officer must proceed to investigate the charge by examining him and witnesses for or against him, for which an adjournment may be had from time to time if necessary.

§ 1478. Upon the evidence so taken, the court or officer must determine, whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he is guilty of the contempt, a fine must be imposed upon him, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, or he must be imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both. But in the discretion of the court, or officer, (in case of inability to pay the fine, or endure the imprisonment,) he may be relieved in such manner and upon such terms as may be just.

§ 1479. If an actual loss or injury, to a party in an action or special proceeding prejudicial to his rights therein, have been caused by the contempt, the court or officer, in addition to the line or imprisonment imposed for the contempt, may order the person proceeded against to pay to the party aggrieved a sum of money sufficient to indemnify him, and to satisfy his costs and expenses, which order, and the acceptance of money under it, is a bar to an action by the aggrieved party for such loss or injury.

§ 1480. When the contempt consists in the omission to perform an act which is yet in the power of the person to perform, he may be imprisoned, until he shall have performed it, and in that case the act must be specified in the warrant of commitment.

§ 1481. Persons proceeded against, according to the provisions of this chapter, are also liable to indictment for the same misconduct, if it be an indictable offence, but the court before which a conviction is had on the indictment, in passing sentence, must take into consideration the punishment before inflicted.

§ 1482. When the warrant of arrest has been returned served, if the person arrested do not appear on the return day, the court or officer may issue another warrant of arrest, or may order the undertaking to be prosecuted, or both. If the undertaking be prosecuted, the measure of damages in the action, is the extent of the loss or injury sustained by the aggrieved party, by reason of the misconduct for which the warrant was issued, and the costs of the proceedings.

§ 1483. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an officer is required to keep a person arrested in actual custody, and to bring him before a court or officer, the inability, from illness or otherwise, of the person to attend is a sufficient excuse for not bringing him up. Nor can the officer be required to confine a person arrested upon the warrant in a prison, or otherwise to restrain him of personal liberty, except so far as may be necessary to secure his personal attendance.

When specific property, real or personal, is taken from the owner and appropriated to public purposes: 2. When the owner of property is required to use, or dispose of, it in a particular manner, for the public benefit; and 3. When a contribution of money is required, towards the expense of local improvement.

§ 1485. The appointment of commissioners must be made upon a previous notice from the party, in whose name the application is made; and none but freeholders of the county can be appointed.

§ 1486. The notice must be given by advertisement, published in a newspaper of the county, not less than once a week for three weeks.

§ 1487. From the time of their appointment, the commissioners, and all their proceedings, shall be under the control of the court, which may, in its discretion, direct the time and place of meeting of the commissioners, and the time of making their report. The court also has control over all the proceedings subsequent to the report of the commissioners including the sale for the assessment, if a sale be made.

§ 1488. Any person, interested in the assessment, may make himself a party to the proceedings, by giving to the commissioners written notice of his wish to be made a party, stating his name and address; and thereafter is entitled to at least six days notice of the meeting of the commissioners, of the time of presenting their report, and of the sale, if any. The notice must be served by delivering it to him personally, or sending the same through the post office to his address; except that when a party comes in after notice already given to the existing parties, a new notice to him is not necessary. But the failure to give the notice required by this section, does not affect the jurisdiction of the court.

§ 1489. The report of the commissioners may refer to a map annexed, accurately tracing the boundaries of property taken or assessed, and need not otherwise describe such property in detail. On receiving the report, the court may confirm or modify it, or may reject it, and order a new report to be made by the same or other commissioners.

§ 1490. Any person interested, may present in writing objections to the report, the facts stated in such objections being verified by oath. The court must decide upon the objections, but if it appear to the court, that there is a fact in dispute between the parties, whether such fact be the amount of damages or otherwise, and a trial thereof by jury be demanded by either party, such trial must be ordered.

§ 1491. When there is a trial by jury, the court may exercise the same control over the jury and the verdict, that is exercised in civil actions, and may thereupon make a final order in the case.

§ 1492. Any sale or lease made for the purpose of satisfying the assessments, mentioned in the third subdivision of section 1484, must be made within three years after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners. Such sale must be reported to the court, which may confirm it, or for good cause order a resale, but no sale can in any case be made, or lease granted, for a longer period than twelve years.

§ 1493. The commissioners are entitled for their services, to the same fees as referees, but such fees, in the aggregate, can never exceed one hundred dollars to each commissioner. Necessary surveyor‘s fees, not exceeding two hundred dollars, and clerk’s fees, for copies of papers, at the rate of live cents for every hundred words, may also be included in the assessment.

§ 1494. Any person desiring a private road to be opened over the land of another, may make application therefore to the county court of the county.

§ 1495. Such application must state briefly the circumstances which make the road desirable to the applicant, and must be verified by him. It must state the names and places of residence of the owners and occupants of the land upon which the road is proposed, and must be accompanied by a map or plan of the road proposed, and of the adjacent lands.

§ 1496. Upon receiving the application, the court must make an order that the persons interested show cause, if they have any, at a specified time and place why the road should not be opened, and in such order must direct the manner of serving the notice, as may appear most likely to reach the persons interested, such service to be not less than ten days before the time specified.

§ 1497. Upon proof of service of the order, if no sufficient cause to the contrary be shown, the court may make an order, directing the sheriff to summon a jury of freeholders, to appear at a specified time and place, to determine the necessity of the road, and the amount of all damages to be sustained by the opening thereof.

§ 1498. The sheriff must execute the order by drawing from the undrawn jury box of a justice in the town, where the property lies, and summoning eighteen jurors, not interested in the question, and indifferent between the parties to appear at the time and place specified in the order; and upon the appearance of the jurors, twelve of them must be drawn, and sworn to make a true inquisition in the premises.

§ 1499. The jury must thereupon go upon the land proposed to be laid out for a road, and the adjacent land, and after examining the application, maps, and plans, and hearing such evidence as may be offered, must make their inquisition and return the same to the court.

§ 1500. If the jury determine, that the road is necessary, it must determine the proper width and location thereof, and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening and continued use thereof. The court may thereupon make an order, describing the road, and declaring it a private road for the applicant, and his assigns, and for travel to and from the property, in respect to which it was applied for. A copy of the order must be filed with the records of roads, in the city or town, where the property is situated.

§ 1501. The court must fix the expense of the proceeding, at such sum as may seem to it reasonable, not exceeding in the whole one hundred dollars, and must direct the payment by the applicant of the same, together with the damages found by the jury, before proceeding to open the road.

§ 1502. The provisions of the statutes, regulating the proceedings of commissioners, or other persons, appointed to estimate or assess the expense of local improvements, in the several cities and villages of this state, or relating to such assessments, or to the sale or lease of real property, for the failure to pay assessments, so far as the same are consistent with the provisions of this chapter, remain in force; the term “commissioners,” being taken to include all persons appointed to estimate or assess such damages.

A corporation may be dissolved by the supreme court, or the county court, of the county where its office, or principal place of business, is situated, upon the voluntary application for that purpose of a majority of its trustees, directors, or other officers having the management of its affairs.

§ 1505. The application must be in writing, and must set forth, either the insolvency of the corporation, or other sufficient reason for terminating its corporate existence, and must contain the following particulars: 1. An inventory of all the property, and of the books, vouchers and securities of such corporation, as far as the same are known to the applicant, or can be ascertained by him; 2. A statement of the capital stock, the number of shares, and their nominal value, the names of the stockholders, the number of shares belonging to each, the amount paid in, and the amount remaining unpaid; 3. An inventory of the debts and liabilities of the corporation, including contracts not completed or satisfied, specifying the names and residence of the creditors respectively, as far as known, the nature of each debt, and the cause and consideration of each: and, 4. A statement of all the liens, or encumbrances outstanding, unsatisfied, on property of the corporation, and the amount actually due, or to become due thereon.

§ 1506. The application must be verified by affidavit, in the same manner as a complaint in an action, and may be presented to a judge of the court either in or out of court.

§ 1506. If the judge be satisfied that the application and schedule are in conformity with this chapter, and if there appear sufficient ground for the application, but not otherwise, he must order notice to be given to all the stockholders, creditors and others interested, to show cause, if they have any, at a specified time and place, why the corporation should not be dissolved. He may also, if the nature of the case require it, restrain, by injunction, the sale or transfer of any property, or the transaction of any business, by or on behalf of such corporation, until the further order of the court, and may, also, then or afterwards, appoint a receiver, if in his opinion, it be necessary.

§ 1507. A copy of the order must be served personally on all the members of the corporation residing and to be found, in the same county, at least ten days before the time appointed, in the same manner as a summons in an action. It must be served on all other persons interested, either personally or by publication thereof, for three weeks successively, next before the time of appearance, in a newspaper printed in the county. The judge may also require its publication in one or more other newspapers, if he deem it necessary, in order to give notice to the persons interested.

§ 1508. At the time and place specified, or at another time and place to which the hearing may be then adjourned, the court must hear the allegations and evidence of the applicant, and of any other party interested. The original application and schedules may be used on the hearing, adjournments may be had, and testimony taken, from time to time, in the discretion of the court, and if it become necessary to take an account, a reference for that purpose may be ordered.

§ 1509. If the court be satisfied that the corporation is insolvent, or that for any other reason, the dissolution thereof will be beneficial to the stockholders, and not injurious to the public, an order of dissolution may be made, and a receiver appointed. Such corporation shall thereby cease to exist, and its property shall be applied in satisfaction of its debts, and in discharge of its liabilities, and the residue distributed among the stockholders, according to their respective interests therein. No action or special proceeding shall abate by such dissolution, but the receiver may, on motion, be substituted therein, for the corporation.

§ 1510. All conveyances, sales, transfers, and mortgages of real or personal property of such corporation, in payment of, or security for, an antecedent debt, or otherwise, in violation of the injunction are void against the receiver and the creditors.

§ 1511. The receiver must, by public notice, appoint a general meeting of all the creditors, and others interested in the corporation, at a time within three months after his appointment, when all accounts and demands for and against the corporation, and all open and subsisting contracts, must be liquidated and classified as far as practicable. A statement showing the condition of the funds, and of the affairs generally in the hands of the receiver, must be then prepared and exhibited by the receiver. All books and papers in the hands of the receiver, are also at all times subject to the examination of the creditors and stockholders.

§ 1512. After such meeting, and within four months from the time of his appointment, the receiver must pay all outstanding just claims against the corporation, to the extent of the funds in his hands, (except such as he is by law authorized to reserve,) or if the funds are insufficient, must make payment and distribution in equal proportions, according to their priority.

§ 1513. If any money remain in the hands of the receiver, or be received by him, after the first dividend, he must within a year thereafter, and as much sooner as the condition of the assets will permit, after giving due notice thereof, make a second, and, if possible, final payment to the creditors, and distribution of the residue to stockholders, or others entitled, of the remaining assets in his hands. If after the second distribution, there still remain any part of the estate not collected or distributed, a third distribution must be made in like manner, and so on, as often as may be necessary; but no distribution among the stockholders can be made within one year after the appointment of the receiver, nor until after all the known debts are paid and liabilities discharged, or a sufficient fund set apart for that purpose.

§ 1514. Notice of every distribution must be published at least once a week, for three weeks next before the time appointed therefore, in a newspaper printed in the county, where the principal place of business of the corporation was situated, and also in the state paper.

§ 1515. Any person having a just claim, who has not been included in the list of creditors, or of persons entitled to distribution, or has not had his just share of the assets at any former distribution, may appear and establish his claim, before the final dividend, and shall thereupon be entitled to his full share out of the remaining assets, if sufficient remain to make his payment or distributive share, equal, in proportion to its amount, to that of other claims of the same class at all former dividends, and may thereafter receive with others his just proportion.

§ 1516. Immediately after all the funds in the hands of the receiver have been paid out and applied, he must make a report to the court, containing a full and accurate account of his proceedings; which report must be filed with the clerk of the court in the county where the principal place of business of the corporation was situated.

§ 1517. Previous notice, of the time and place of filing the account, must be published once a week for three weeks, in a newspaper printed in the county, and also in the state paper, and a copy of such notice must also be served on every party, who has previously, in writing, requested notice of the final account. Such notice must also state, that the account will remain on file for the examination of all persons interested, for two weeks from the time of tiling the same, and if no objection be made to it by the service of notice, in writing, on the receiver, within that time, that an order closing the account and discharging the receiver, will be entered.

§ 1518. Upon satisfactory proof, produced to the court, showing that such account has been tiled after due notice thereof; in the manner for the time prescribed in the last section, and that no objection has been made thereto, by notice served on the receiver, an order may be made that the account of the receiver be confirmed, and he be thereupon discharged.

§ 1519. An objection taken to such account, must state generally in what respect it is erroneous or defective, and the parties objecting are thereupon entitled to five days’ notice of the time and place of presenting the account, with the objection, to the court for decision.

§ 1520. The judge must proceed to examine the account and the objection, pursuant to the notice, on the day specified, or on some other day to which the examination may be adjourned, and may, when it involves the taking of oral testimony, or the examination of numerous vouchers, refer the same to a referee, to hear the parties and their evidence, and if necessary, restate the account. Upon filing the report of a referee, on a receiver’s account, an opportunity must be given to the parties interested to be heard.

§ 1521. The court must make an order, allowing, disallowing or modifying such account, according to the report of the referee or otherwise, as may be just, and must direct the proper payment and distribution of the balance, if any be found in the receiver’s hands Such order is final as to all parties receiving notice, pursuant to the provisions of this title.

§ 1522. Every receiver, appointed pursuant to this title, must close the affairs of the corporation, and render his final account to the court, by filing the same within sixteen months from the time of his appointment, or within such further time as the court, an application and cause shown, may allow.

§ 1525. Any person, claiming to have a cause of action against another, in any of the cases mentioned in section 1527, may serve on him a written notice, mentioning the alleged cause of action, and requiring him to appear in relation thereto, before the court of conciliation of the county, where the notice is served, at a specified time, not less than five days from the time of service.

§ 1527. The cause of action, of which this court has cognizance, are libel, slander, malicious prosecution, breach of promise of marriage, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and personal violence of any kind.

§ 1528. At the time specified in the notice, or at such other time as the hearing may be adjourned to by the court, the parties appearing must be received by the judge, apart from all other persons, except as is provided in section 1537, and thereupon, it is the duty of the judge to hear the allegations and explanations of the parties, to inform them of their respective rights, and to endeavor to reconcile their differences.

§ 1529. Parties may voluntarily appear before the court, without notice, and such appearance is as effectual as if notice had been previously served.

§ 1530. If a reconciliation be had, a memorandum thereof, stating the nature of the controversy, or alleged cause of action, the appearance of the parties, and the fact of the reconciliation, without specifying the terms thereof, unless it be agreed by the parties to specify them, must be entered in a book of records, to be kept by the judge, and such entry must be signed by the respective parties. The reconciliation thus effected, shall be the final determination of the matter in controversy.

§ 1531. If the parties agree to a judgment, in favor of one against the other, in settlement of their differences, the judge may make, at the foot of the entry of reconciliation, a memorandum stating the judgment agreed upon. A transcript of such memorandum, certified by the judge, may be filed in the office of the county clerk, and shall thereupon have the same effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as the judgment of a county court.

§ 1532. If, instead of a reconciliation, the terms of which are settled between the parties, they voluntarily submit their matters in difference to the court, and agree to abide the judgment, or assent thereto, in the presence of the court, such submission and agreement, or assent, must be entered in the book of records, and signed by the respective parties; and thereupon the judgment of the court, made pursuant to the submission, shall have the same effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as the judgment mentioned in section 1531.

§ 1533. If, after the service of the notice prescribed in section 1525, either party fail to appear, or if the parties appearing be not reconciled as mentioned in sections 1530 and 1531, or do not enter into the submission and agreement mentioned in section 1532, it is the duty of the judge to make an entry in his book of records, stating in a summary manner the nature of the charge, the notice given, the proof of service thereof, the failure to appear of either party, or the appearance of the parties and their failure to be reconciled.

§ 1534. The entries in such book of records, or certified copies thereof signed by the judge, are evidence of the facts therein stated; and it is the duty of the judge to give a transcript of the entries in any case, certified by him, from his records, to either party on request.

§ 1535. In any action hereafter brought for the recovery of damages, for a cause of action mentioned in section 1527, the plaintiff cannot recover costs, unless he produce at the trial the certified copy mentioned in the last section, and unless it thereby appear that the notice was duly served, and that he appeared pursuant thereto, or that both the parties appeared without notice, as mentioned in section 1529. The defendant cannot recover costs in such action, when it appears that after service of the notice, he failed to appear pursuant thereto.

§ 1536. If, however, the case be one requiring a provisional remedy, and of such urgency as not to justify the delay arising from a previous notice to appear before the court of conciliation, the action may be commenced without such appearance or notice, and if the plaintiff afterwards give the notice, and appear before the court of conciliation pursuant thereto, he may recover costs accruing subsequent to such appearance.

§ 1537. When an infant, or a woman is a party to a proceeding before the court of conciliation, such infant or woman may be attended by the guardian, or husband, of such party, or if there be none, then by some friend approved by the court.

§ 1538. In an action between partners, or between principal and agent, if either party make it appear to the court, that previous to his complaint or answer, he made an offer in writing to his adversary, to submit the matter in difference between them to arbitration, as in the next section prescribed, no costs can be awarded against the party making such offer.

§ 1544. The submission to arbitration must be in writing, and may be to one or more persons.

§ 1545.

The clerk must thereupon enter in his register of actions, a note of the submission, with the names of the parties, the names of the arbitrators, the date of the submission, when filed, and the time limited by the submission, if any, within which the award must be made. When so entered, the submission cannot be revoked without the consent of both parties, the arbitrators may be compelled by the court to make an award, and the award may be enforced by the court, in the same manner as a judgment. If the submission be not made an order of the court, it may be revoked at any time before the award is made, or if unrevoked, the award can be enforced by action only.

§ 1546. Arbitrators have power to appoint a time and place for hearing, to adjourn from time to time, to administer oaths to witnesses, to hear the allegations, and evidence of the parties, and to make an award thereon.

§ 1547. All the arbitrators must meet and act together during the investigation, but when met a majority may determine any question. Before acting, they must be sworn, before an officer authorized to administer oaths, faithfully and fairly to hear and examine the allegations and evidence of the parties, in relation to the matters in controversy, and to make a just award, according to their understanding.

§ 1548. The award must be in writing, signed by the arbitrators, or a majority of them, and delivered to the parties.

§ 1549. The county court, on motion, may vacate the award, upon either of the following grounds, and may order a new hearing before the same arbitrators, or not in its discretion: 1. That it was procured by corruption or fraud: 2. That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct, or committed gross error in refusing, on cause shown, to postpone the hearing, or in refusing to hear pertinent evidence, or otherwise acted improperly in a manner by which the rights of the party were prejudiced: 3. That the arbitrators exceeded their powers in making their award, or that they refused, or improperly omitted to consider a part of the matters submitted to them, or that the award is indefinite, or cannot be performed. The court may, on motion, modify or correct the award, where it appears: 1. That there was a miscalculation in figures, upon which it was made, or that there is a mistake in the description of some person or property therein: 2. When a part of the award is upon matters not submitted, which part can be separated from other parts, and does not affect the decision on the matters submitted: 3. When the award is imperfect in form, and if it had been a verdict could have been amended, or those imperfections disregarded.

§ 1550. Upon such motion, the costs thereof; may, in the discretion of the court, he added to the award, but no other costs or charges.

§ 1551. The decision upon the motion, is subject to appeal in the same manner as an order which is subject to appeal in a civil action; but the judgment, entered before a motion is made, is not subject to appeal.

§ 1552. If a submission to arbitration be revoked, and an action be brought therefore, as provided in section 1545, the amount to be recovered can only be the costs, expenses and damages sustained, in preparing for and attending the arbitration, nor can the recovery be increased by any penalty or sum fixed as damages in the submission or otherwise, in case of revocation.

§ 1553. The provisions of this title must not be construed to prevent a recovery in an action upon the written award of one or more arbitrators, to whom a matter in controversy may be submitted in writing, to decide upon their own knowledge, with or without testimony.

A record of appointment of administrators, whether general or special, and of executors; 4. A record of the appointment of general guardians of infants, and of committees of insane persons and drunkards ; 5.

A book of fees, in which must be entered the items of all fees for services in each particular proceeding, or estate, and when and by whom paid.

§ 1557. To each of such books, there must be attached an index, securely bound in the volume, referring to the entries in alphabetical order, under the name of the person, to whose estate or business they relate, and indicating the page of the book where the entry is made.

§ 1558. The successor in office of a surrogate has power to complete any unfinished business commenced by his predecessor.

§ 1560. Costs may be awarded in favor of one party against another, to be paid personally out of the estate or fund, in any proceedings contested adversely before the surrogate; but such costs cannot exceed those allowed in the supreme court, for a trial in civil actions. Witnesses’ fees, and other disbursements similar to those allowed in the supreme court, may also be allowed.

§ 1561. Orders for the payment of money may be enforced by execution, or otherwise, in the same manner as judgments for the payment of money in the supreme court; except, that in the surrogate’s court, all process is issued by the surrogate.

§ 1562. Executions, warrants, and other process issued by a surrogate, must be executed by the sheriff or coroner of the county, to which they are sent to be executed, in the same manner, and with the same powers, responsibilities and fees, as process issued from the supreme court.

§ 1564. For the purpose of exercising these powers, the court may appoint a committee, or if necessary, two or three in each case, whose duty it is, 1. To take possession of the property of the person, and manage the same in a manner proper to produce income, and to prevent its being wasted or destroyed: 2. To take the care and custody of such person, and so far to hold him in restraint, as may be necessary to prevent injury to the person or property of himself or others: 3. To provide out of his property for the maintenance of such person and his family, and the education of his children: 4. To make an inventory of his property, real and personal, and to file the same in the surrogate’s office, immediately after his appointment, and to keep and annually file in the surrogate’s office, an account of all sums received and expended for the year, verified by his oath.

§ 1565. The overseer of the poor of the town, or the superintendent of the poor of the county, where the insane person or habitual drunkard resides, or any member of the family of such insane person or drunkard, or any person related to him by blood or marriage, who, in case of his death, intestate, would be entitled to any portion of his property, may apply to the surrogate for the appointment of the committee.

§ 1566. Such application must be in writing, stating the facts upon which it is founded, and verified by the affidavit of the applicant, to the effect that he believes it to be true.

§ 1567. Upon receiving the application, the surrogate must immediately appoint a time and place in the town or city, where the insane person or drunkard resides, to investigate the truth of the allegations made in the application, which time must not be less than eight not more than sixteen days thereafter.

§ 1568. The surrogate must also issue a citation to the insane person, to appear at the time and place specified, and show cause, if he have any, against the application. Such citation, with a copy of the application, must be served by the sheriff, at least six days before the time of appearance, on the insane person or drunkard and on some member of the family of such person, or of the family in which he resides, of suitable age and discretion, other than the applicant.

§ 1569. The surrogate must also issue to the sheriff an order, directing him to summon a jury of eighteen persons, to be drawn from a justice’s jury box, of the town or city where the trial is to be had, to appear at the time and place appointed for the investigation and to determine the truth of the allegations made in the application.

§ 1570. The jury must be drawn by the sheriff, in the presence of the justice, and summoned pursuant to the surrogate’s order, and a return thereof made, at the time and place specified, stating the time and manner of summoning each juror.

§ 1571. At the time and place appointed, or at such other time as the hearing may be adjourned to for cause shown, the surrogate must attend and draw and empanel a jury of twelve persons, in the same manner as a jury is drawn by a justice, for the trial of civil actions. When the jury is completed, it must be sworn by the surrogate, to investigate the truth of the matters stated in the application, and to find a true inquisition thereon, according to the evidence.

§ 1572. The surrogate must preside at the trial, and decide all questions of law arising therein, and the trial must be conducted in all respects like a trial in a civil action, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

§ 1573. Upon such trial, the alleged insane person or drunkard may appear by counsel, and may produce witnesses on his part. But whether he appear or not, the applicant must prove the truth of the allegations made in his application.

§ 1574. The inquisition of the jury must be in writing, subscribed by at least nine of the jurors, and must declare that there exists no sufficient reason for a committee, or that the person is in one of the conditions mentioned in section 345, specifying which of them. The surrogate must instruct the jury, as to the form of the inquisition, and it may be found and subscribed in his presence, but he can take no part in the deliberation of the jury, nor advise them in respect to their decision, except on questions of law.

§ 1575. If the jury find that the person is in one of the conditions mentioned in section 1563, the surrogate must immediately appoint a committee for him. When the application is for a cause other than habitual drunkenness, the jury must state in the inquisition, whether or not, in their opinion, the disability is likely to be permanent. If the jury finds that there exists no sufficient reason for a committee, the application must be dismissed.

§ 1576. The appointment must be in writing, and must define the general duties of the committee, as prescribed in section 1564. It must be recorded in the surrogate’s office, in the book where the appointment of general guardians is recorded. The committee must also give public notice of his appointment by advertisement in a newspaper printed and published in the county.

§ 1577. The committee must be sworn to execute faithfully the duties of his trust, according to the best of his ability. He must also give security in the same manner, and to the same effect as the general guardian of an infant. The oath and undertaking must be filed in the surrogate’s office.

§ 1578. The surrogate must also appoint appraisers; and an inventory and appraisal of all the personal property of the insane person, must be taken, verified and returned in the same manner and with the same effect, as in the case of administration of the estate of a deceased person, except that it must contain also a description of the real property, and a valuation by the appraisers of the annual income of each parcel thereof.

§ 1579. The powers and responsibilities of a committee, in the execution of the trust reposed in him as prescribed by section 1564, are in all respects like those of a general guardian, in respect to an infant and his estate, except as in this chapter otherwise provided.

§ 1580. In the payment of debts, the committee must be governed by the same rules, as those which regulate the conduct of administrators.

§ 1581. When there is not personal property, sufficient with the income of the real property, for the payment of the debts, or for the proper maintenance of the insane person or drunkard person and his family, the surrogate may upon a proper accounting by the committee, of the personal, and of the income of the real, property, order the real property or such part thereof as he may deem necessary, to be sold or mortgaged to procure the necessary funds therefore.

§ 1582. When the inquisition does not state, that the disability is likely to be permanent, the surrogate must, before ordering a sale, ascertain the probable necessary expenditure over the annual income, for a period not exceeding three years in advance, and must limit the sale or mortgage, to so much of the real property as can be sold or mortgaged separately, without material injury to the residue of the property, and as may be sufficient to raise such sum, and in all cases he must first ascertain by evidence the present condition of the person. Further sales or mortgages may be ordered from time to time, as may be necessary.

§ 1583. The proceedings for a sale or mortgage, must be conducted in all respects in the same manner, as for a sale by administrators, except as herein otherwise provided; but the proceeds of sales, instead of being paid to the surrogate, are to be placed in the hands of the committee.

§ 1584. The committee may be required to give new or additional security, or to render an account, and may be removed. He is also subject, in all other respects, to the control and direction of the surrogate, in the same manner as the general guardian of an infant.

§ 1585. The committee has power, under the direction of a court of competent jurisdiction, to execute a conveyance of real property, or to do any other act, in the specific performance of a contract made by the insane person or drunkard, when he was capable to contract.

§ 1586. The power of a committee ceases, upon the death of the insane person, and also when the disability, in respect to which he was appointed, has been adjudged by the surrogate to have ceased, or when he has been removed for any cause as provided in the next two sections.

§ 1587. Upon application to the surrogate to remove a committee or revoke appointment, made upon the affidavits of at least two respectable persons, showing misconduct of the committee, or that the disability, in respect to which the committee was appointed, has ceased, a citation must be issued to the committee, to the person upon whose application he was appointed, if living within the county, and to the next of kin, if any, within the county, who are of full age, to show cause, if they have any, why the appointment of the committee should not be removed or his appointment revoked.

§ 1588. The citation must be served at least fourteen days before the time appointed for the hearing. Upon its return duly served, or upon another day to which the hearing may be adjourned, the surrogate must bear the evidence offered for and against the application. If sufficient cause for the continuance of the committee be not shown, the surrogate must by an order declare, that the disability, in respect to which the committee was appointed, has ceased, that the powers of the committee are thereforee revoked, and that the party for whom he was appointed is restored to his original rights. If misconduct of the committee be established, he must be removed and another appointed in his place.

§ 1589. The fees of the surrogate, on the appointment of a committee, are the same, as on the proof of a will, and for his removal, and the proceedings in relation thereto, the same as for similar services in case of administrators. Upon a trial before him, the surrogate may order costs to be paid, either by a party, or out of the funds or estate, to any other party, not exceeding the costs allowed for the trial of a civil action.

§ 1593. The appeal must be taken within thirty days after notice of the order or judgment appealed from, but such appeal does not affect the order appealed from, unless, upon motion, the supreme court, on cause shown, direct a suspension of the order, until the appeal is determined.

§ 1598. The application is to be heard in the same manner as any other motion, and if it be shown to the satisfaction of the court, that the allegations of the application are true, that the applicant is insolvent, that he does not conceal any of his property and that he has not after knowing his insolvency, and within six months before his application, given a preference to a creditor for an antecedent debt, by any payment or disposition of his property, the court may make an order, declaring that the applicant is an insolvent debtor, and appointing a receiver of his property.

§ 1599. Upon a certificate of the receiver, upon a copy of the inventory, that the insolvent has transferred and delivered to him all the property specified therein, excepting property exempt from execution, to be therein specified, with all books, instruments and papers relating thereto, and after due notice to the judgment creditor, the court may make an order, discharging the insolvent from his imprisonment; but such discharge shall not affect the judgment nor any other remedy for the collection thereof, other than against the person of the insolvent.

§ 1605.

Debts due to persons who were residents of this state at the time of the application: 2. Debts contracted in this state: 3. Debts due to creditors who have received a dividend from the receiver.

The court to whom, the report is made, may, at the time appointed for receiving the same, or at such other time to which the hearing may be adjourned, on good cause shown, set aside the report, and appoint, as often as may be necessary, new referees, who shall proceed in the manner hereinafter directed; and, if not set aside, the court must, by order, confirm the report and admeasurement.

§ 1623. The admeasurement so made and confirmed, shall, at the expiration of twenty days from the date of such confirmation, unless appealed from, be binding and conclusive, as to the location and extent of the widow's right of dower, on the parties who applied for the same, and on all parties to whom notice has been given, as hereinafter directed. But no person shall be precluded thereby from controverting the right of such widow to the dower so admeasured.

§ 1624. The widow to whom dower is admeasured, after the expiration of twenty days from the date of the confirmation, unless the same be appealed from, may, if possession be withheld or her right denied, bring an action to recover the possession of the lands so admeasured to her for her dower, and, upon recovery, may hold the same during her life, subject to the payment of all taxes and charges accruing thereon, subsequent to her taking possession.

§ 1625. The order of a court, confirming the admeasurement of dower, may be reviewed, by appeal in the same manner as a judgment in an action in the same court, and the manner of bringing an appeal, and the security required thereon, must be in conformity with similar proceedings in civil actions.

§ 1626. The appellate court, may, on such appeal, affirm or reverse the order, and may require a new admeasurement by the same or new referees, to be appointed by the appellate court, if the appeal be to the supreme court, or by the court in which the proceedings were originally had, if the appellate court so direct. Proceedings upon a second or other subsequent report may be had in all respects as on the first.

§ 1627. Such reasonable sum, for the costs of the party applying for admeasurement, as may be certified by the court, not exceeding twenty dollars, for each parcel of land out of which dower may be separately admeasured, besides referees’ fees and other disbursements, must be paid, one-half by the widow and the other half by the adverse party. The allowance of costs on the appeal is in the discretion of the appellate court, but when allowed, they must be at the rate allowed on appeals, to the same court, in civil actions.

§ 1628. When dower is admeasured pursuant to the provisions of this title, and the right to dower is disputed, if in an action brought by the widow to recover possession, she fail to establish her right, the share of the costs on admeasurement, which may have been paid by the other party, may be added to the costs of the defense in such action; and if the dower be withheld from her and she fail for two years to bring an action for the recovery thereof, she shall be liable in an action to the other party for the expenses of admeasurement paid by him.

TITLE XII. OF MISCELLANEOUS PROCEEDINGS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Disposition of the real property of infants.
Discovering the death of a person on whose life an estate depends.
The collection and remission of fines and forfeitures.
General provisions.

CHAPTER I. DISPOSITION OF THE REAL PROPERTY OF INFANTS.

Conveyance of infants’ estates under previous contract.
Sale of infant’s estate when necessary.
Manner of application and service of notice. 
Special guardian to be appointed.
Guardian to give security.
What security required.
Court to hear evidence, or may refer.
Order to be made, its contents.
Report of sale to be confirmed.

§ 1629. A conveyance by an infant, of real property, owned or held by him, may be ordered by the supreme court in an action in either of the following cases: 1. When the property is held in trust for another: 2. When an agreement to convey the property has been made, and the agreement ought to be specifically performed by the infant. When so ordered, the conveyance is as effectual as if the infant were of full age. But nothing in this chapter affects a sale of infants’ estate when made, as provided in special statutes, by an executor or administrator, upon an order of the surrogate’s court.

§ 1630. The real property and leasehold estate of an infant, may be sold or mortgaged under the direction of the supreme court, or the county court of the county in a special proceeding, on the application in writing of the general guardian or some person next of kin of the infant, for him, in either of the following cases: 1. When the sale or mortgage is necessary for the infant’s support or education: 2. When the interest of the infant will be promoted by it, by reason of the unproductiveness of the property or its being exposed to waste or for any other peculiar circumstances. But such sale or mortgage can in no case be made contrary to the provisions of the will or conveyance by which the property was devised or granted to the infant. The application must state the grounds therefore and must be verified as a complaint in an action.

§ 1631. A copy of the application must be served by delivery in the manner required for the service of a summons to commence an action against an infant, with a notice stating that the same will be presented to the court at a specified time and place, and that application to appoint a special guardian will then be made. The service must be at least ten days before the time of application, and two days in addition for every fifty miles distance from the residence of the infant to the place specified.

§ 1632. Upon the day specified, or some other day to which the hearing shall be than adjourned, the court must appoint a suitable person to be special guardian for the infant in the proceedings to be had thereon; or two or more such guardians may be appointed.

§ 1633. Before the appointment of the guardian can be effectual, and before any further proceedings can be had, security must be given by the guardian, to the infant, to be approved by the court, and in such sum as the court may by an order direct, faithfully to perform the trust reposed in him, and to account for and apply all moneys received by him under the directions of the court.

§ 1634. The security must be an undertaking of the guardian, either with one or more sufficient sureties, who must justify, in the manner required for bail on arrest in an action, or with security by mortgage on unencumbered real property in the county where the real property lies, or the infant resides, worth, exclusive of buildings thereon, double the value of the amount of security required.

§ 1635. Upon security being given and upon at least eight days notice to the special guardian, or upon his ‘consent without notice, the court must proceed to hear the evidence for and against the application, or may order a reference, as in an action, to ascertain and report the facts.

§ 1636. Upon the hearing, or in case of reference, upon the report of the referee, the court must by an order grant or refuse the application. If granted, the order may direct either a sale or a mortgage of the whole or any part of the property, and must contain a description of the same.

§ 1637. Upon a report to the court, verified by the oath of the guardian, of an agreement for the sale or mortgage of the property, subject to the approval of the court, it must confirm or disapprove the same; if approved, a conveyance must be given by the guardian under the direction of the court. The report of the agreement may be made at the time of the hearing or afterwards.

§ 1638. The court must make such order for the application and disposition of the proceeds of the sale or mortgage, and for the investment of the same or any part thereof, as it shall deem best for the benefit of the infant, and must require accounts to be rendered periodically by the guardian or other person entrusted with the disposition of the proceeds or its income. Such proceeds shall be deemed real property of the same nature as the property disposed of.

§ 1639. Where property is subject to dower, and the person entitled thereto consents in writing to accept a sum in place thereof, or the income during life of a permanent investment of a reasonable sum, the court may ascertain and direct the payment of such sum out of the proceeds of the property, or the investment thereof and the payment of the income, as may be deemed reasonable and may be acceptable to the penson entitled. If no such consent be given the sale or mortgage must be made subject to the right of dower. Before any sum shall be paid or investment made, an effectual release of the right of dower must be made.

§ 1640. When there are several infants owning real estate as tenants in common or joint tenants, they may all be united in one application, but the security of the guardian must be to each severally.

§ 1641. The costs and expenses of the proceedings, not to exceed twenty-five dollars when there is but one infant, and ten dollars for each additional one embraced in the same application, may be paid by the order of the court from the proceeds of the property.

CHAPTER II. DISCOVERING THE DEATH OF A PERSON ON WHOSE LIFE AN ESTATE DEPENDS.

Application to produce person on whose life an estate depends.
Contents of application.
Twenty days’ notice to be given.
Proceedings on the hearing.
Costs may be allowed.
An estate recovered on presumption of death to be restored afterwards, if the person is living.

§ 1641. A person entitled to claim real property, or the profits thereof, after the death of another who is entitled to a prior estate, or interest therein, may, once apart, by motion, apply to the supreme court for a order, that the person, upon whose life such prior estate depends, be produced.

§ 1642. The application must be made upon affidavit, showing, 1. The interest of the applicant, in the real property which is the subject of the application, describing it, with the grounds thereof: 2. The belief of the applicant, that the person, upon whose life the prior estate depends, is dead, and that his death is concealed by the party, against whom the application is made.

§ 1643. The motion must be upon previous notice, of at least twenty days, and must be made at a special term, where a motion might be made in an action triable in the county where the real property is situated.

§ 1644. Upon such motion, the court may make an order, requiring the production and proof of the identity of the person, upon whose life the estate depends, and, in default of his production, may require of the party against whom the application is made, proof of his existence, with satisfactory reasons for his absence. Such evidence may be taken in open court, or by reference, or by commission to another state or county, together with any other evidence, which may be necessary to determine the question of the existence of such person. Such order must then be made declaring the existence or death of the person, as may be in the judgment of the court conformable to the fast. This order is primary evidence of the facts therein determined.

§ 1645. Costs on such application, and the proceedings founded thereon, not to exceed twenty-five dollars, may, in the discretion of the court, be ordered to be paid, by either party, to the other.

§ 1646. An estate, which shall have been recovered upon the presumption or proof of the death of a person, pursuant to this chapter, must be restored to the party from whom it was recovered, or to his heirs, or representatives, with the issues and profits in the meantime, if it be established that such person is living.

Sheriff to collect fine or imprison.
When sheriff liable.
When undertaking in criminal action may be prosecuted.
County court may remit certain fines.
Power to remit fines restricted.
Summary judgment allowed on undertakings. 

§ 1647. Every order imposing a fine, except upon conviction for a public offence, must contain a direction that the delinquent be imprisoned until the fine be paid; not to exceed one day for every two dollars of the fine.

§ 1648. The clerk, immediately after the imposition of a line, must deliver to the sheriff a certified copy of the order imposing it, and transmit a copy of the same to the treasurer of the county. One order may provide for the collection of all the fines imposed at the same court.

§ 1649. The sheriff must proceed to collect the fines or to imprison the delinquents named in the order, and within sixty days from the time of receiving the copy of the order, must pay over to the county treasurer the fines collected by him, and tile his return in the county clerk’s office, showing the manner in which he has executed the order, stating the amount paid to the county treasurer, if any. Fines imposed by a city court must be paid into the city treasury.

§ 1650. The sheriff is liable to the county or city for the amount of every fine specified in the order, unless it appear by his return that the person, on whom the fine was imposed, has been arrested, or could not be found. Such liability may be enforced by action in the supreme court or by motion in the county court. The sheriff is liable by action for a false return.

§ 1651. When an undertaking or the condition of a recognizance, in a criminal action, is by any court declared broken, the court in which it is filed, or the county court of the county where it is filed, may order the same to be prosecuted. If judgment be given for the plaintiff in such action, it must be for the penalty or sum specified in the undertaking.

§ 1652. The county court may, except in the cases specified in the next section, remit wholly or partly fines imposed or forfeitures declared by any court in the county, on application and cause shown, and on such terms as may be deemed just. If the fine or forfeiture remitted shall have been paid, the officer in whose hands it may be, must refund the same, or the part thereof remitted, upon an order of the court to that effect.

§ 1653. Fines imposed on conviction of a public offence or for actual contempt of a court, or for disobedience to its orders or process, can only be remitted by the court by which they were imposed, and that on cause shown, upon notice to the district attorney. An undertaking entered into in one county, for the appearance of a person in another, can only be remitted or discharged by the court, in which such person was bound to appear, or by the county court of that county, after the time designated for such appearance, and then only upon notice to the district attorney and on cause shown.

§ 1654. Summary judgment upon an undertaking declared forfeited, may be ordered by the court, without action, on motion of the district attorney, after ten days previous notice to the adverse party, of the application for the forfeiture and for judgment thereon.

CHAPTER IV. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Appeals from final orders in county court.
Manner of the appeal.
General rules as to certain special proceedings.
General rule as to amendments in special proceedings.

§ 1655. From the judgment of a county court, in any special proceeding, except when otherwise expressly prescribed by this code, an appeal may be taken to the supreme court, and thence to the court of appeals.

§ 1656. The appeal must be taken in the same manner, within the same time, and upon the same security, as an appeal from a judgment at a general term of the county court, in a civil action commenced therein, except as otherwise expressly provided by a particular provision of this code.

§ 1657. In special proceedings where the costs are not by this code defined, the court may, in its discretion, require costs to be paid by any party to another, or to be paid from the fund which is the subject of the proceeding. The costs allowed must be a fixed sum, to be determined by the court, on the hearing, or afterwards on motion, and must not exceed the rate of costs allowed for similar services in actions.

§ 1658. Amendments, in furtherance, of justice may be allowed by any court or judicial officer in a special proceeding before him, in every stage thereof, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise, as may be proper; and a substitution may, in the same manner, be allowed of a successor in interest, in place of a party, when by reason of death or other cause it becomes proper.

Of the general principles of evidence.
Of the kinds and degrees of evidence.
Of the production of evidence.
Of the effect of evidence.
Of the rights and duties of witnesses.
Of evidence in particular cases and miscellaneous and general provisions.

GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND DIVISIONS.

Definition of evidence.
Definition of proof.
Definition of law of evidence.
The degree of certainty, required to establish facts.
Four kinds of evidence specified.
Several degrees of evidence specified.
Original evidence, defined.
Secondary evidence defined.
Direct evidence defined.
Indirect evidence defined.
Primary evidence defined.
Partial evidence defined.
Satisfactory evidence defined.
Indispensible evidence defined.
Conclusive evidence defined.
Cumulative evidence defined.
Corroborative evidence defined.
General divisions and arrangement.

§ 1659. Judicial evidence is the means, sanctioned by law, of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a question of fact.

§ 1660. Proof is the effect of evidence, the establishment of a fact by evidence.

§ 1661. The law of evidence, which is the subject of this part of the code, is a collection of general rules established by law, 1. For declaring what is to be taken as true, without proof: 2. For declaring the presumptions of law, both those which are disputable and those which are conclusive; and 3. For the production of legal evidence: 4. For the exclusion of whatever is not legal: 5. For determining in certain cases the value and effect of evidence.

§ 1662. The law does not require demonstration, that is, such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty; because such proof is rarely possible. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof, which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.

§ 1663. There are four kinds of evidence: 1. The knowledge of the court: 2. The testimony of witnesses: 3. Writings: 4. Other material objects presented to the senses.

§ 1664. There are several degrees of evidence: 1. Original and secondary: 2. Direct and indirect: 3. Primary, partial, satisfactory, indispensable and conclusive.

§ 1665. Original evidence is an original writing or material object introduced in evidence.

§ 1666. Secondary evidence is a copy of such original writing or object, or oral evidence thereof.

§ 1667. Direct evidence is that which proves the fact in dispute, directly, without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if true, conclusively establishes that fact. For example, if the fact in dispute be an agreement, the evidence of a witness who was present and witnessed the making of it, is direct.

§ 1668. Indirect evidence is that, which tends to establish the fact in dispute by proving another, and which, though true, does not of itself conclusively establish that fact, but which affords an inference or presumption of its existence. For example, a witness proves an admission of the party to the fact in dispute. This proves a fact, from which the fact in dispute is inferred.

§ 1669. Primary evidence is that, which suffices for the proof of a particular fact, until contradicted and overcome by other evidence. For example, the certificate of a recording officer is primary evidence of a record; but it may be afterwards rejected upon proof that there is no such record.

§ 1670. Partial evidence is that, which goes to establish a detached fact, in a series tending to the fact in dispute. It may be received, subject to be rejected as incompetent, unless connected with the fact in dispute, by proof of other facts. For example, on an issue of title to real property, evidence of the continued possession of a remote occupant is partial, for it is of a detached fact, which may or may not be afterwards connected with the fact in dispute.

§ 1671. That evidence is deemed satisfactory, which ordinarily produces moral certainty, or conviction in an unprejudiced mind. Such evidence alone will justify a verdict. Evidence less than this is denominated slight evidence.

§ 1672. Indispensable evidence is that, without which a particular fact cannot be proved.

§ 1673. Conclusive or unanswerable evidence is that, which the law does not permit to be contradicted. For example, the record of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be contradicted by the parties to it.

§ 1674. Cumulative evidence is additional evidence of the same character, to the same point.

§ 1675. Corroborative evidence is additional evidence of a different character, to the same point.

§ 1676. This part of the code is divided into six titles: The first contains the general principles of evidence: The second relates to the kinds and degrees of evidence and contains the rules by which is determined what may be received as evidence: The third title relates to the production of evidence: The fourth relates to the effect of evidence: The fifth relates to the rights and duties of witnesses: The sixth relates to evidence in particular cases, and contains also miscellaneous and general provisions.

TITLE I. OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE.

One witness sufficient to prove a fact.
Testimony confined to personal knowledge.
Testimony to be in presence of persons affected.
Witness presumed to speak the truth.
One person not affected by acts of another.
Declarations of predecessor in the title evidence.
Declarations which are part of the transaction.
Evidence relating to third persons.
Declarations of deceased person, evidence of pedigree.
Declarations of deceased person, evidence against his successor in interest.
When part of a transaction proved, the whole is admissible.
Contents of writing, how proved.
An agreement reduced to writing, deemed the whole.
Construction of language, related to place where used.
Construction of states and instruments, general rule.
The intention of the legislature or parties.
The circumstances to be considered.
Terms to be construed in their general acceptation.
Written words control those printed in a blank form.
Persons skilled may testify to decipher characters.
Of two constructions, which preferred.
A written instrument construed as understood by parties.
Construction in favor of natural right preferred.
Material allegation only to be proved.
Evidence confined to material allegation.
Affirmative only to be proved.
Facts which may be proved on trial.

§ 1677. The direct evidence of one witness, who is entitled to full credit, is sufficient for proof of any fact, except usage, perjury and treason.

§ 1678. A witness can testify of those facts only which he knows of his own knowledge, that is, which are derived from his own perceptions; except in those few express cases, in which his opinions, or inferences or the declarations of others, are admissible.

§ 1679. A witness can be heard only upon oath or affirmation; and, upon a trial, he can be heard only, in the presence, and subject to the examination, of all the parties, if they choose to attend and examine.

§ 1680. A witness is presumed to speak the truth. This presumption, however, may be repelled by the manner in which he testifies, by the character of his testimony, or by evidence affecting his character or motives, or by contradictory evidence; and the jury are the exclusive judges of his credibility.

§ 1681. The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by the declaration, act or omission of another, except by virtue of a particular relation between them; therefore proceedings against one cannot affect another.

§ 1682. Where, however, one derives title to real property from another, the declaration, act or omission of the latter, while holding the title, in relation to the property is evidence against the former.

§ 1683. Where also the declaration, act or omission, forms part of a transaction, which is itself the fact in dispute, or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act or omission, is evidence, as part of the transaction.

§ 1684. And where the question in dispute between the parties, is the obligation or duty of a third person, whatever would be evidence for or against such person, is primary evidence between the parties.

§ 1685. The declaration, act or omission of a member of a family, who is deceased, or out of the jurisdiction, is also admissible as evidence of common reputation, in cases where, on questions of pedigree, such reputation is admissible.

§ 1686. The declaration, act or omission of a deceased person, having sufficient knowledge of the subject, against his pecuniary interest, is also admissible as evidence to that extent, against his successor in interest.

§ 1687. When part of an act, declaration, conversation or writing, is given in evidence by one party, the whole, on the same subject, may be inquired into by the other; when a letter is read, the answer may be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation or writing, which is necessary to make it understood, may also be given in evidence.

§ 1688. There can be no evidence of the contents of a writing, other than the writing itself, except in the following cases: 1. When the original is in the possession of the party against whom the evidence is offered, and he withholds it under the circumstances mentioned in section 1758: 2. When the original cannot be produced, by the party by whom the evidence is offered, in a reasonable time, with proper diligence, and its absence is not owing to his neglect or default: 3. When the original is a record, or other document, in the custody of a public officer: 4. When the original is a record or other document, of which a certified copy is expressly made evidence by this code, or some other statute of this state: 5. When the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents, which cannot be examined in court, without great loss of time, and the evidence sought from them, is ‘only the general result of the whole. In the cases mentioned in subdivisions 3 and 4, a copy of the original must be produced; in those mentioned in subdivisions 1 and 2, either a copy or oral evidence of the contents.

§ 1689. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the‘ parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms, and therefore there can be, between the parties and their representatives, or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of the agreement, other than the contents of the writing, except in the following cases: 1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings: 2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute. But this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined in section 1693, or to explain an ambiguity, intrinsic or extrinsic, or to establish illegality or fraud. The term agreement includes deeds and wills, as well as contracts between parties.

§ 1690. The language of a writing is to be interpreted, according to the meaning it bears in the place of its execution, unless the parties have reference to a different place.

§ 1691. In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare, what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; and, where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.

§ 1692. In the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature, and in the construction of an instrument, the intention of the parties, is to be pursued if possible; and when a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former. So a particular intent will control a general one, that is inconsistent with it.

§ 1693. For the proper construction of an instrument, the circumstances under which it was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument, and of the parties to it, may also be shown, so that the judge be placed in the position of those, whose language he is to interpret.

§ 1694. The terms of a writing are presumed to have been used in their primary and general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible, that they have a local, technical or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used and understood in the particular instance, in which case the agreement must be construed accordingly.

§ 1695. When an instrument consists partly of written words, and partly of a printed form, and the two are inconsistent, the former controls the latter.

§ 1696. When the characters, in which an instrument is written, are difficult to be deciphered, or the language of the instrument is not understood by the court, the evidence of persons skilled in deciphering the characters, or who understand the language, is admissible to declare the characters, or the meaning of the language.

§ 1697. When the terms of an agreement have been intended in a different sense by the different parties to it, that sense is to prevail, against either party, in which he supposed the other understood it; and when different constructions of a provision are otherwise equally proper, that is to be taken which is most favorable to the party, in whose favor the provision was made.

§ 1698. A written notice, as well as every other writing, is to be construed according to the ordinary acceptation of its terms. Thus a notice to the drawers or endorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note, that it has been protested for want of acceptance or payment, must be held to import, that the same has been duly presented for acceptance or payment, and the same refused, and that the holder looks for payment, to the person to whom the notice is given.

§ 1699. Where a statute or instrument, is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natural right, and the other against it, the former is to be adopted.

§ 1701. None but a material allegation need be proved.

§ 1702. Evidence must correspond with the substance of the material allegations and be relevant to the question in dispute. Collateral questions must therefore be avoided. It is however within the discretion of the court, to permit inquiry into a collateral fact, when such fact is directly connected with the question in dispute and is essential to its proper determination, or when it affects the credibility of a witness.

§ 1703. Each party must prove his own affirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation, except when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of the right or title, on which the cause of action or defense is founded, nor even in such case when the allegation is a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party.

§ 1704. In conformity with the preceding provisions, evidence may be given, upon a trial, of the following facts : 1. The precise fact in dispute; 2. The act, declaration or omission of a party as evidence against such party; 3. An act or declaration of another, in the presence and within the observation of a party, and his conduct in relation thereto; 4. The act or declaration, verbal or written, of a deceased person, in respect to the relationship, birth, marriage or death of any person related by blood or marriage to such deceased person; the act or declaration of a deceased person, done or made against his interest in respect to his real property; and also in criminal actions, the act or declaration of a dying person, made under a sense of impending death, respecting the cause of his death; 5. After. proof of a partnership or agency, the act or declaration of a partner or agent of the party, within the scope of the partnership or agency, and its existence; the same rule applies to the act or declaration of a joint owner, joint debtor or other person jointly interested with the party; 6. After proof of a conspiracy, the act or declaration of a conspirator against his co-conspirator, and relating to the conspiracy; 7. The act, declaration or omission; forming part of a transaction, as explained in section 1683; 8. The testimony of a witness deceased, or out of the jurisdiction, or unable to testify, given in a former action between the same parties, relating to the same matter; 9. The opinion of a witness respecting the identity or handwriting of a person, when he has knowledge of the person or handwriting; his opinion on a question of science, art or trade, when he is skilled therein; 10. The opinion of a subscribing witness to a writing, the validity of which is in dispute, respecting the mental sanity of the signer, and the opinion of an intimate acquaintance, respecting the mental sanity of a person, the reason for the opinion being given; 11. Common reputation, existing previous to the controversy, respecting facts of a public or general interest, more than thirty years old, and in cases of pedigree and boundary; 12. Usage, to explain the true character of an act, contract or instrument, where such true character is not otherwise plain; but usage is never admissible except as an instrument of interpretation; 13. Monuments and inscriptions in public places, as evidence of common reputation, and entries in family bibles or other family books or charts, engravings on rings, family portraits, and the like, as evidence of pedigree; 14. The contents of a writing, when oral evidence thereof is admissible; 15. Any other facts from which the facts in issue are presumed, or are logically inferable: 16. Such facts as serve to show the credibility of a witness as explained in section 1680.

Knowledge of the court.
Witnesses.
Writings.
Material objects presented to the senses, other than writings.
Indirect evidence.
Indispensable evidence.
Conclusive and unanswerable evidence.

CHAPTER I. KNOWLEDGE OF THE COURT.

Certain facts of general notoriety, assumed to be true.
Specification of such facts.

§ 1705. There are certain facts of such general notoriety, that they are assumed to be already known to the court. Of those facts evidence need not be produced.

§ 1718. Laws, whether organic or ordinary, are either written or unwritten.

§ 1719. A. written law is that which is promulgated in writing, and of which a record is in existence.

§ 1720. The organic law is the constitution of government, and is altogether written. Other written laws are denominated statutes. The written law of this state is therefore contained in its constitution and statutes, and in the constitution and statutes of the United States.

§ 1721. Statutes are public or private. A private statute, is one which concerns only certain designated individuals, and affects only their private rights. All other statutes are public, in which are included, statutes creating or affecting corporations.

§ 1722. Unwritten law is the law not promulgated and recorded, as mentioned in section 1719, but which is nevertheless observed and administered in the courts of the country. It has no certain repository; but is collected from the reports of the decisions of the courts and the treatises of learned men.

§ 1723. Books, printed or published, under the authority of a sister state, or foreign country, and purporting to contain the statutes, code, or other written law, of such state or country, or proved to be commonly admitted in the tribunals of such state, or country, as evidence of the written law thereof, are admissible in this state, as evidence of such law.

§ 1724. The public seal of the state or country, affixed to a copy of a written law, or other public writing, is also admissible as evidence of such law or writing.

§ 1725. The oral testimony of witnesses skilled therein, is admissible as evidence of the unwritten law, of a sister state, or foreign country, as are also printed and published books of reports of decisions of the courts of such state, or country, or proved to be commonly admitted in such courts.

§ 1726. The recitals in a public statute, are conclusive evidence of the facts recited for the purpose of carrying it into effect, but no further. The recitals in a private statute, are conclusive evidence between parties who claim under its provisions, but no farther.

§ 1727. A judicial record, is the record or official entry of the proceedings in a court of justice, or of the official act of a judicial officer, in an action or special proceeding.

§ 1728. A judicial record of this state, or of the United States, may be proved by the production of the original, or by a copy thereof; certified by the clerk, or other person having the legal custody thereof. That of a sister state, may be proved by the attestation of the clerk, and the seal of the court annexed, if there be a clerk and seal, together with a certificate of the chief judge, or presiding magistrate, that the attestation is in due form.

§ 1729. A judicial record of a foreign country, may be proved by the attestation of the clerk, with the seal of the court annexed, if there be a clerk and seal, or of the legal keeper of the record with the seal of his office annexed, if there be a seal, together with a certificate of the chief judge, or presiding magistrate, that the person making the attestation is the clerk of the court, or the legal keeper of the record, and in either case, that the signature of such person is genuine; and also together with the certificate of the secretary of state, or other officer of the government, under whose authority the record is kept, having the custody of the great or principal seal of such government, to the effect that the court or officer, whose judicial act is certified, had jurisdiction to perform such act, specifying generally the nature of the jurisdiction, and verifying the signature of the clerk, or other legal keeper of the record, and also verifying the signature of the chief judge, or presiding magistrate.

§ 1730. A copy of the judicial record of a foreign country is also admissible in evidence upon proof; 1. That the copy offered has been compared by the witness with the original, and is an exact transcript of the whole of it: 2. That such original was in the custody of the clerk of the court, or other legal keeper of the same: and 3. That the copy is duly attested by a seal, which is proved to be the seal of the court where the record remains, if it be the record of a court, or if there be no such seal, or if it be not a record of a court, by the signature of the legal keeper of the original.

§ 1731. The effect of a judgment, or final order, in an action or special proceeding, before a court or judge of this state, or of the United States, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or order, is as follows : 1. In case of a judgment, or order, against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political or legal condition or relation of a particular person, the judgment or order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration, or the condition or relation of the person: 2. In other cases, the judgment or order is, in respect to the matter directly adjudged, conclusive between the parties, and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing, under the same title, and in the same capacity.

§ 1732. Other judicial orders of a court or judge of this state, or of the United States, create a disputable presumption according to the matter directly determined, between the same parties, and their representatives and successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing, under the same title, and in the same capacity.

§ 1733. The parties are deemed to be the same, when those, between whom the evidence is offered, were on opposite sides in the former case, and a judgment, or other determination, could in that case have been made between them alone, though other parties were joined with both or either.

§ 1734. That only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment, which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein, or necessary thereto.

§ 1735. Whenever, pursuant to the last four sections, a party is bound by a record, and such party stands in the relation of a surety for another, the latter is also bound, from the time that he has notice of the action or proceeding, and an opportunity, at the surety’s request, to join in the defense.

§ 1736. The effect of a judicial record of a sister state, is the same in this state as in the state where it was made, except that it can only be enforced here by an action or special proceeding, and except also, that the authority of a guardian or committee, or of an executor or administrator, does not extend beyond the jurisdiction of the government, under which he was invested with his authority.

§ 1737. The effect of the judicial record of a court of admiralty of’ a foreign country, is the same as if it were the record of a court of admiralty of the United States.

§ 1738. The effect of the judgment of any other tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment, is as follows: 1. In case of a judgment against a specific thing, the judgment is conclusive, upon the title to the thing: 2. ln case of a judgment against a person, the judgment is presumptive evidence of a right, as between the parties, and their successors in interest by a subsequent title, and can only be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud or clear mistake of law or fact.

§ 1739. Any judicial record may be impeached, by evidence of a want of jurisdiction in the court or judicial officer, of collusion between the parties, or of fraud in the party offering the record, in respect to the proceedings.

§ 1740. The jurisdiction sufficient to sustain a record, is jurisdiction over the cause, over the parties, and over the thing when a specific thing is the subject of the judgment.

§ 1741. Other official documents may be proved as follows : 1. Acts of the executive of this state, by the records of the state department of the state, and of the United States, by the records of the state department of the United States, certified by the heads of those departments respectively; they may also be proved by public documents, printed by order of the legislature or congress, or either house thereof: The proceedings of the legislature of this state, or of congress, by the journals of those bodies respectively, or either house thereof, or by published statutes or resolutions, or by copies certified by the clerk, or printed by their order: 3.

The acts of the executive, or the proceedings of the legislature, of a foreign country, by journals published by their authority, or commonly received in that county as such, or by a copy certified, under the seal of the country or sovereign, or by a recognition thereof, in some public act of the executive of the United States. 5. Acts of a municipal corporation of this state, or of a board or department thereof, by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, or by a printed book published by the authority of such corporation: 6. Documents of any other class in this state, by the original, or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof : 7. Documents of any other class in a sister state, by the original, or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, together with the certificate of the secretary of state, judge of the supreme, superior, or county court, or mayor of a city, of such state, that the copy is duly certified by the officer having the legal custody of the original: 8. Documents of any other class in a foreign country, by the original, or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, with a certificate under the seal of the country or sovereign, that the document is a valid and subsisting document of such country, and that the copy is duly certified by the officer having the legal custody of the original.

§ 1742. A public record of a private writing may be proved by the original record, or, by a copy thereof certified by the legal keeper of the record.

§ 1743. Entries in public, or other official books, or records, made in the performance of his duty, by a public officer of this state, or by another person, in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law, are primary evidence of the facts stated therein.

§ 1744. A transcript from the record, or docket, of a justice of the peace of a sister state, of a judgment rendered by him, of the proceedings in the action before the judgment, of the execution and return, if any, subscribed by the justice and verified in the manner prescribed in the next section, is admissible evidence of the facts stated therein;

§ 1745. There must be attached to the transcript, a certificate of the justice, that the transcript is in all respects correct, and that he had jurisdiction of the action, and also a further certificate of the clerk or prothonotary of the county in which the justice resided at the time of rendering the judgment, under the seal of the county, or the seal of the court of common pleas or county court thereof, certifying that the person subscribing the transcript was, at the date of the judgment, a justice of the peace in the county, and that the signature is genuine. Such judgment, proceedings and jurisdiction may also be proved by the justice himself, or the production of his docket, or by a copy of the judgment and his oral examination as a witness.

§ 1746. Whenever a copy of a writing is certified fair the purpose of evidence, the certificate must state that the copy has been compared by the certifying officer with the original, and is a correct transcript therefrom, and of the whole of such original, or of a specified part thereof. The official seal, if there be any, of the certifying officer, must also be affixed to the certificate, except when the certificate of a clerk of a court is used in the same court or before an officer thereof.

§ 1747. The provisions of the preceding sections of this article, applicable to the public writings of a sister state, are equally applicable to the public writings of a territory of the United States.

§ 1748. Private writings are either, 1. Sealed; or, 2. Unsealed.

§ 1749. A seal is a particular sign, made to attest in the most formal manner, the execution of an instrument.

§ 1750. A public seal in this state is a stamp or impression made upon wax, wafer, paper, or any other substance, upon which a visible and permanent impression can be made. A private seal may be made in the same manner, or it may be made, without an impression, by a wafer or wax attached to the instrument or by a paper attached to it by an adhesive substance. A scroll or other sign, made in a sister state or foreign country, and there recognized as a seal, must be so regarded in this state, except for a transfer of real property, in this state.

§ 1751. The seal affixed to a writing is presumptive evidence of a consideration. In other respects there is no difference between sealed and unsealed writings, except as to the time of commencing actions thereon. A writing under seal may thereforee be changed, or altogether discharged, by a writing not under seal, or by an oral agreement otherwise valid.

§ 1752. The execution of an instrument is the subscribing and delivering it, with or without affixing a seal.

§ 1753. An agreement in writing, without a seal, for the compromise or settlement of a debt, is as obligatory as if a seal were affixed.

§ 1754. The last three sections do not repeal any statute of this state expressly requiring a seal to a deed or other instrument.

§ 1755. A subscribing witness, is one who sees a writing executed, or hears it acknowledged, and, at the request of the party, thereupon signs his name as a 	 witness.

§ 1756. Historical works, books of science or art, and Published maps or charts, when made by person indifferent between the parties, are primary evidence of facts of general notoriety and interest.

§ 1757. The original writing must be produced and proved, except as provided in section 1688. If it have been lost, proof of the loss must first be made, before evidence can be given of its contents. Upon such proof being made, together with proof of the due execution of the writing, its contents may be proved by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the recollection of a witness, as provided in section 1688.

§ 1758. If the writing be in the custody of the adverse party, he must first have reasonable notice to produce it. If he then fail to do so, the contents of the writing may be proved as in case of its loss. But the notice to produce it, is not necessary where the writing is itself a notice, or where it has been wrongfully obtained or withheld by the adverse party.

§ 1759. Though a writing, called for by one party, is produced by the other, and is thereupon inspected by the party calling for it, he is not obliged to produce it as evidence in the case.

§ 1760. If there be a subscribing witness to a writing, produced in evidence, its execution must be proved by him, if he can be produced, and can testify. If there be more than one subscribing witness, the evidence of one is sufficient. If all the subscribing witnesses be dead, or out of the jurisdiction, or incapable of attending or testifying, or cannot be found, the handwriting of one of them, and that of the party must be proved.

§ 1761. If the subscribing witness denies, or does not recollect, the execution of the writing, its execution may still be proved by other evidence.

§ 1762. Where however, evidence, is given that the party, against whom the writing is offered, has at any time admitted its execution, no other evidence of the execution need be given, when the instrument is one mentioned in section 1765, or one produced from the custody of the adverse party, and has been acted upon by him as genuine.

§ 1763. The handwriting of a person may be shown, by any one who believes it to be his, and who has seen him write, or has seen writings purporting to be his, upon which he has acted or been charged, and who has thus acquired a knowledge of his handwriting.

§ 1764. Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given, by a comparison, made by the witnesses, or the jury, with writings, admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered.

§ 1765. Where a writing is more than thirty years old, the comparison may be made with writings, purporting to be genuine, and generally respected and acted upon as such, by persons having an interest in knowing the fact.

§ 1766. The entries and other writings of a person. deceased, made at or near the time of the transaction, and in a position to know the facts stated therein, may be read, as primary evidence of the facts stated therein, in the following cases: 1. When the entry was made against the interest of the person making it: or 2. When it was made in a professional capacity, and in the ordinary course of professional conduct: 3. When it was made in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law.

§ 1767. When an entry is repeated, in the regular course of business, one being copied from another, at or near the time of the transaction, all the entries are equally regarded as originals.

§ 1768. Every private writing, except last wills and testaments, may be acknowledged or proved, and certified, in the manner provided for the acknowledgment or proof of conveyances of real property, and the certificate of such acknowledgment or proof, is primary evidence, of the execution of the writing, in the same manner as if it were a conveyance of real property.

§ 1769. Every county clerk, and the register of the city and county of New-York, must receive and file in his office, any private writing, delivered to him for that purpose, and give a written receipt therefore. Such writing must be properly endorsed, so as to indicate its general nature, the names of the parties thereto, and the time of filing, and must be deposited and kept in such office separate from other papers. It is then subject to the examination of any person but cannot be withdrawn, except temporarily, upon the written order of the depositor, or his legal representatives, or on the order of a court of record, for the purpose of being read in evidence therein.

§ 1770. Every surrogate must receive, and deposit in his office, any last will and testament, delivered to him for that purpose, and give a written receipt therefore. Such will must be enclosed in a sealed wrapper, so that its contents cannot be read, and be endorsed with the name of the testator, his place of residence, and the precise time of the deposit, and must not be read or opened, until delivered to a person entitled to it, as provided in the next section.

§ 1771. It can be delivered only, 1. To the testator in person: 2. Upon his written order, proved by a subscribing witness: or, 3. After his death, to the person named in the endorsement, if any, or if he be dead, to the person entitled to the papers of the testator: or, 4. If not so delivered, the surrogate must publicly open and examine it, make known its contents, and file it in his office; to remain there until proved, if capable of proof, and then to be delivered to the person entitled to its custody, or until required by the authority of a competent court to be produced therein.

§ 1772. The record of a conveyance of real property, or other record, a transcript of which is admissible in evidence, must not be removed from the office where it is kept, except upon the order of a court, or when temporarily removed by the clerk, having it in custody, to the court of which he is clerk, or to courts held in the city or village, where his office is situated.

CHAPTER IV. MATERIAL OBJECTS PRESENTED TO THE SENSES OTHER THAN WRITINGS:

§ 1773 Whenever an object, cognizable by the senses, has such a relation to the fact in dispute, as to afford reasonable grounds of belief respecting it, or to make an item in the sum of the evidence, such object may be exhibited to the jury, or its existence, situation and character may be proved by witnesses. The admission of such evidence must be regulated by the sound discretion of the court.

§ 1776. A presumption is a deduction which the law expressly directs to be made from particular facts.

§ 1777. An inference must be founded: 1. On a fact legally proved: and, 2. On such a deduction from that fact as is warranted by a consideration of the usual propensities or passions of men, the particular propensities or passions of the person whose act is in question, the course of business, or the course of nature.

That a trustee or other person, whose duty it was to convey real property to a particular person, has actually conveyed to him, when such presumption is necessary to perfect the title of such person, or of his successor in interest: 41. The uninterrupted use by the public of land, for a burial ground, for ten years, with the consent of the owner, and without a reservation of his rights, is presumptive evidence of his intention to dedicate it to the public, for that purpose. 42. Every sale of personal property, capable of immediate delivery to the purchaser, and every assignment of such property, by way of mortgage or security or upon any condition whatever, unless the same be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession, creates a presumption of fraud, as against the creditor of the seller or assignor, during his possession, or as against subsequent purchasers in good faith, disputable only by making it to appear on the part of the person claiming under such sale or assignment, that the same was made in good faith, and without intent to defraud such creditors or purchasers: 43. When two persons perish in the same calamity, such as a wreck, a battle, or a conflagration, and it is not shown who died first, and there are no particular circumstances from which it can be inferred, survivorship is presumed, from the probabilities resulting from the strength, age and sex, according to the following rules: First. If both those who have perished were under the age of fifteen years, the older is presumed to have survived: Second. If both were above the age of sixty years, the younger is presumed to have survived: Third. If one be under fifteen and the other above sixty, the former is presumed to have survived: Fourth. If both be over fifteen and under sixty, and the sexes be different, the male is presumed to have survived; if the sexes be the same, then the older: Fifth. If one be under fifteen or over sixty, and the other between those ages, the latter is presumed to have survived.

§ 1784. A written will cannot be revoked or altered, otherwise than by another written will, or another writing of the testator, declaring such revocation or alteration, and executed with the same formalities, required by law for the will itself; or unless the will be burnt, torn, cancelled, obliterated or destroyed, with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the same, by the testator himself, or by another person, in his presence, by his direction and consent; and when so done by another person, the direction and consent of the testator, and the fact of such injury or destruction, must be proved by at least two witnesses.

§ 1786. The preceding section must not be construed to affect the power of a testator, in the disposition of his real property by a last will and testament; nor to prevent a trust from arising or being extinguished by implication or operation of law, nor to abridge the power of any court, to compel the specific performance of an agreement, in case of part performance thereof.

§ 1788. The authority to execute a sealed instrument must be under seal, if the sealing of the instrument be essential to its validity.

§ 1789. In the following cases the agreement is invalid, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration, be in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged, or by his agent; evidence therefore of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or secondary evidence of its contents: 1.

An agreement for the leasing, for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein. An agreement relating to real property, made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid unless the authority of the agent be in writing, subscribed by the party.

§ 1795. The process by which the attendance of a witness is required, is a subpoena.

It may also require him to bring with him any books, documents, or other things under his control, which he is bound by law to produce in evidence.

§ 1796. The subpoena is issued as follows: 1. To require attendance before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, it is issued in the name of the court, before which the attendance is required, or in which the issue is pending: 2. To require attendance out of court, in an action or special proceeding pending in court, it is issued in the name of the court, in which the action or proceeding is pending: 3. To require attendance out of court before a judge, justice, or other officer, authorized to administer oaths in a special proceeding, under the authority of this state, and pending in court, it is issued by the judge, justice, or other officer, before whom the attendance is required: 4. To require attendance before a commissioner, appointed to take testimony, by a court of any other state, or country, or before a judge, justice or other person, in any other case allowed by law, it may be issued by a judge of the supreme court, or by a county judge or justice of the peace, in places within their respective jurisdictions.

§ 1797. Any party or attorney of a party, in an action, or special proceeding pending in court, may at any time, issue in the name and on behalf of the court, as many subpoenas for witnesses within the state, pursuant to subdivisions 1 and 2 of the last section, as may be required by such party. Every judge, justice, or other officer, authorized by subdivisions 3 and 4 of the last section to issue subpoenas, may on the application of any party, and such proof, as this code requires in the particular case, issue subpoenas signed by such judge, justice, or other officer, with his name of office for such witnesses, as the party reasonably requires.

§ 1798. The service of a subpoena is made, by showing the original, and delivering a copy or a ticket, containing its substance, to the witness personally, giving or offering to him at the same time, the fees, to which he is entitled, for travel to and from the place designated, and one day’s attendance there. Such service must be made, so as to allow the witness a reasonable time, for preparation and travel to the place of attendance.

§ 1799. If a witness be concealed in a building or vessel, so as to prevent the service of a subpoena, upon him, the court or officer issuing the subpoena, may, upon proof by affidavit, of the concealment, and of the materiality of the witness, make an order, that the sheriff of the county serve the subpoena, and the sheriff must serve it accordingly, and for that purpose may break into the building or vessel, where the witness is concealed.

§ 1800. A witness is not obliged to attend for examination upon a deposition, or for cross-examination upon an affidavit, in any other county than that of his residence, or where he is served with the subpoena; nor is a witness obliged to attend for oral examination, before a court or judge out of the county where the witness resides, or is served with the subpoena; except that in case of an action or special proceeding pending in court, a judge thereof, or a judge of the supreme court, or a county judge, upon an affidavit of a party, or his attorney, shewing that the testimony of the witness is material and his attendance necessary, may endorse on the subpoena an order for the attendance of the witness; in which case, the service of such subpoena and order, and the payment of double fees to the witness, are sufficient to require his attendance, in the same manner as if he resided in the county.

§ 1801. A person present in court, or before a judicial officer, may be required to testify, in the same manner, as if he were in attendance upon a subpoena, issued by such court or officer.

§ 1802. Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be sworn or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition when required, may be punished as a contempt, by the court or officer issuing the subpoena, or requiring the witness to be sworn; and if the witness be a party, his complaint, answer or reply may be stricken out.

§ 1803. A witness disobeying a subpoena shall also forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of fifty dollars, and all damages which he may sustain, by the failure of the witness to attend; which forfeiture and damages may be recovered in a civil action.

§ 1804. In case of the failure of a witness to attend, the court, or officer issuing the subpoena, upon proof of the service thereof, and of the failure of the witness, may issue a warrant to the sheriff of the county, to arrest the witness, and bring him before the court or officer where his attendance was required.

§ 1805. Every warrant of commitment, issued by a court or officer, pursuant to this chapter, must specify therein particularly the cause of the commitment, and if it be for refusing to answer a question, such question must be stated in the warrant. And every warrant to arrest, or commit a witness, pursuant to this chapter, must be directed to the sheriff of the county, where the witness may be, and must be executed by him in the same manner as process issued by the supreme court.

§ 1806. If the witness be a prisoner, confined in a prison within this state, an order for his examination in the prison upon deposition, or for his temporary removal and production, before a court or officer, for the purpose of being orally examined, may be made, as follows : 1. By the court itself, in which the action or special proceeding is pending unless it be a justice’s court: 2. By a judge of the supreme court, or county judge of the county, where the action or proceeding is pending, if pending in a justice’s court, or before a judge, or other person out of court.

§ 1807. Such order can only be made on the motion of a party, upon affidavits, showing the nature of the action or proceeding the testimony expected from the witness, and its materiality.

§ 1808. If the witness be imprisoned in the county where the action or proceeding is pending, and for a cause other than a sentence for felony, his production may be required. In all other cases, his examination must be taken upon deposition.

§ 1837. The order of proof must be regulated by the sound discretion of the court. Ordinarily the party, beginning the case, must exhaust his evidence before the other party begins.

§ 1838. If either party require it, the judge may exclude from the court room any witness of the adverse party not at the time under examination, so that he may not hear the testimony of other witnesses.

§ 1839. When a witness does not understand and speak the English language, an interpreter must be sworn to interpret for him.

§ 1840. The court may exercise a reasonable control over the mode of interrogation, so as to make it as rapid, as distinct, as little annoying to the witness, and as effective for the extraction of the truth, as may be, but subject to this rule, the parties may put such legal and pertinent questions as they see fit. The court, however, may stop the production of further evidence, upon any particular point, when the evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reasonable doubt.

§ 1841. The examination of a witness by the party producing him, is denominated the direct examination; the examination of the same witness, upon the same matter, by the adverse party, the cross-examination. The direct examination must be completed before the cross-examination begins, unless the court otherwise direct.

§ 1842. A question, which suggests to the witness the answer which the examining party desires, is denominated a leading or suggestive question. On a direct examination, leading questions are not allowed, except in the sound discretion of the court, under special circumstances, making it appear that the interests of justice require it.

§ 1843. A witness is allowed to refresh his memory, respecting a fact, by anything written by himself or under his direction, at the time when the fact occurred or immediately thereafter, or at any other time when the fact was fresh in his memory, and he knew that the same was correctly stated in the writing. But in such case the writing must be produced, and may be seen by the adverse party, who may, if he choose, cross-examine the witness upon it, and may read it to the jury. So also a witness may testify from such a writing, though he retain no recollection of the particular facts; but such evidence must be received with caution.

§ 1844. The opposite party may cross-examine the witness, as to any facts stated in his direct examination or connected therewith, and in so doing, may put leading questions, but if he examine him, as to other matters, such examination is to be subject to the same rules as a direct examination.

§ 1845. The party producing a witness, is not allowed to impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, but he may contradict him by other evidence, and may also show that he has made at other times, statements inconsistent with his present testimony, as provided in section 1848.

§ 1846. A witness once examined, cannot be re-examined as to the same matter, without leave of the court, But he may be re-examined as to any new matter, upon which he has been examined by the adverse party. And after the examinations on both sides are once concluded, the witness cannot be recalled without leave of the court. Leave is granted or withheld, in the exercise of a sound discretion.

§ 1847. A witness may be impeached by the party against whom he was called, by contradictory evidence, or by evidence that his general reputation for truth is bad, or that his moral character is such as to render him unworthy of belief, but not by evidence of particular wrongful acts; except that it may be shown by the examination of the witness, or the record of the judgment, that he has been convicted of a felony.

§ 1848. A witness may also be impeached, by evidence that he has made, at other times, statements inconsistent with his present testimony; but before this can be done, the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of times, places and persons present; and he must be asked whether he has made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them. If the statements be in writing, they must be shown to the witness, before any question is put to him concerning them.

§ 1849. Evidence of the good character of a party, is not admissible in a civil action, not of a witness in any action, until the character of such party or witness has been impeached, or unless the issue involve his character.

§ 1850. Whenever a writing is shown to a witness it may be inspected by the opposite party, and if proved by the witness, must be read to the jury before his testimony is closed, or it cannot be read, except on recalling the witness.

§ 1851 The judge himself, or any juror, may be called as a witness by either party; but in such case it is in the discretion of the court or judge, to order the trial to be postponed or suspended, and to take place before another judge or jury.

TITLE IV. OF THE EFFECT OF EVIDENCE.

§ 1852. The jury, subject to the control of the court, in the cases specified in this code, are the judges of the effect or value of evidence addressed to them, except when it is hereby declared to be conclusive. They are however to be instructed by the court, on all proper occasions; I. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discretion, and in subordination to the rules of evidence; 2. That they are not bound to decide in conformity with the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do not produce conviction in their minds, against a less number, or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying their minds; 3. That a witness, false in one part of his testimony, is to be distrusted in others; 4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust, and the oral admissions of a party with caution: 5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue must be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory, the decision must be made according to the preponderance of evidence; that in criminal cases, guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt; 6. That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence which it is in the power of one side to produce, and of the other to contradict, and therefore, 7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered, when it appears that stronger and more satisfactory was within the power of the party, the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust.

Witnesses bound to attend when subpoenaed.
Witnesses bound to answer questions.
Right of witnesses to protection.

§ 1853. It is the duty of a witness, duly served with a subpoena, to attend at the time appointed, with any papers under his control required by the subpoena, to answer all pertinent and legal questions, and, unless sooner discharged, to remain till the testimony is closed.

§ 1854. A witness must answer questions legal and pertinent to the matter in issue, though his answer may establish a claim against himself. But he need not give an answer, which will have a tendency to subject him to punishment for a felony. Nor need he give an answer, which will have a direct tendency to degrade his character, unless it be to the very fact in issue, or to a fact from which the fact in issue would be presumed. But a witness must answer as to the fact of his previous conviction for felony.

§ 1855. It is the right of a witness to be protected from irrelevant, insulting or improper questions, and from harsh or insulting demeanor; to be detained only so long as the interests of justice require it; to be examined only as to matters legal and pertinent to the issue.

§ 1856. Every person who has been in good faith, served with a subpoena, to attend as a witness before a court, judge, commissioner, referee, or other person, in a case where the disobedience of the witness may be punished as a contempt, is exonerated from arrest, in a civil action, while going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and returning therefrom. The arrest of a witness contrary to this section is void, and when willfully made, is a contempt of the court; and the person making it, is responsible to the witness arrested, for double the amount of the damages which may be assessed against him, and is also liable to an action at the suit of the party serving the witness with the subpoena, for the damages sustained by him in consequence of the arrest.

§ 1857. But an officer is not so liable, unless the person claiming exemption make, if required, an affidavit, stating: 1. That he has been served with a subpoena, to attend as a witness before a court, officer, or other person, specifying the same, the place of attendance, and the action or proceeding in which the subpoena was issued, and: 2. That he has not been thus served by his own procurement, with the intention of avoiding an arrest. The affidavit may be taken by the officer, and exonerates him from liability for not making the arrest or for discharging the witness when arrested.

§ 1858. The court or officer issuing the subpoena, and the court or officer before whom the attendance is required, may discharge the witness from an arrest made in violation of section 1856. If the court have adjourned before the arrest, or before application for the discharge, a judge of the court, or a county judge, may grant the discharge.

TITLE VI. OF EVIDENCE IN PARTICULAR CASES AND MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Evidence in particular cases
Proceedings to perpetuate testimony.
Administration of oaths and affirmations.
General provisions.

CHAPTER I. EVIDENCE IN PARTICULAR CASES.

An offer equivalent to payment.
Whoever pays entitled to receipt.
Objections to tender must be specified.
Rules for contrasting description of lands.
Compromise offer of no avail, but admission of facts may be shown.
In action for divorce, admission not sufficient.

§ 1859. An offer in writing, to pay a particular sum of money, or to deliver a written instrument or specific personal property, is, if not accepted, equivalent to the actual production, and tender of the money, instrument or property.

§ 1860. Whoever pays money, or delivers an instrument or property, is entitled to a receipt therefore, from the person to whom the payment or delivery is made, and may demand a proper signature to such receipt as a condition of the payment or delivery.

§ 1861. The person to whom a tender is made, must at the time specify any objection he may have to the money, instrument or property, or he must be deemed to have waived it, and if the objection be to the amount of money, the terms of the instrument, or the amount or kind of property, he must specify the amount, terms or kind which he requires, or be precluded from objecting afterwards.

§ 1862. The following are the rules, for construing the descriptive part of a conveyance of real property, when the construction is doubtful, and there are no other sufficient circumstances to determine it: 1. Where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others, which are indefinite, unknown or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by the first mentioned particulars: 2. When permanent and visible, or ascertained boundaries or monuments, are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines, angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount: 3. Between different measurements, which are inconsistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines, paramount to both: 4. When a road, or a stream of water not navigable, is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the thread of the stream, are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream is held under another title; 5. When tide water is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to low water mark are included in the conveyance: 6. When the description refers to a map, and that reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls them, if it appear, that the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other definite, and ascertained particulars.

§ 1863. An offer of compromise is not an admission, that any thing is due; but admissions of particular facts, made in a negotiation for a compromise, may be proved, unless otherwise specially agreed at the time.

§ 1864. In an action for divorce, on the ground of adultery, a confession of adultery, whether in or out of the pleadings, is not of itself sufficient to justify a judgment of divorce.

Manner of taking the deposition.
Deposition to be filed.

§ 1866. The applicant must produce to a judge of the supreme court, or to a county judge, an affidavit, stating, 1. That the applicant is a party, or expects to be a party, to an action in a court of this state: 2. That the testimony of a witness, residing in this state, whose place of residence is stated is necessary to the prosecution or defense of such action: and generally the facts expected to be proved: 3. If the action be not actually commenced, that the party named who is expected to be adverse to the applicant, resides in this state, and is of full age. The judge may thereupon, in his discretion, make an order, allowing the examination, and prescribing how long before the examination, the order and notice of the time and place therefore must be served.

§ 1867. Upon proof of personal service upon the person, who is, or is expected to be the adverse party, of the order, copy of the affidavit, and of a notice that the examination will be taken before a judge of the supreme court, or county judge of the county wherein the witness resides or may be at a specified time and place, such judge may take the deposition of the witness conditionally, and the examination may, if necessary, be adjourned from time to time.

§ 1868. Every answer or declaration of the witness must be taken down, unless the parties otherwise agree. The deposition, when completed, must be carefully read to, and subscribed by, the witness, then certified by the judge, and immediately thereafter filed in the office of the clerk of the county where it was taken, together with the order for the examination of the witness, the affidavit on which the same was granted, and the affidavit of service of the affidavit, order, and notice.

§ 1869. The affidavits filed with the deposition, or a certified copy thereof, are primary evidence of the facts stated therein, to show compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 1870. If a trial be had, between the persons named in the affidavit as parties actual or expectant, or their successors in interest, upon proof of the death or insanity of the witness, or of his inability to attend the trial by reason of age, sickness, or settled infirmity, the deposition, or a certified copy thereof, may be given in evidence by either party.

§ 1871. The deposition so taken and read in evidence has the same effect as the oral testimony of the witness, and no other, and every objection to the witness, or to the relevancy of any question put to him, or of any answer given by him, may be made in the same manner, as if he were examined orally at the trial.

CHAPTER III. ADMINISTRATION OF OATHS AND AFFIRMATIONS.

Another form.
Form may be varied to suit witnesses’ belief.
Any person who prefers it may declare or affirm.
An affirmation deemed equivalent to oath.

§ 1872. Every court, judge, justice or, other officer, or person, authorized to take testimony, in any action or proceeding, or to decide upon evidence, has power to administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses.

§ 1873. An oath is usually administered as follows: the person, who swears, lays his hand upon the gospels, while the person administering the oath, thus addresses him: “You do swear that the evidence you shall give in this issue, (or matter) pending between __ and __, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God,” and thereupon the person, who swears, assents by kissing the book.

§ 1874. Any person who desires it, may swear by expressing his assent, when addressed, in the following form: “You do swear, in the presence of the everliving God, that the evidence you shall give, &c.,” as in the last section, holding up his hand or not, at his option.

§ 1875. Whenever the court, before which a person is offered as a witness, is satisfied that he has a peculiar mode of swearing, connected with, or in addition to, the usual form of administration, which, in his opinion, is more solemn or obligatory, the court may in its discretion adopt that mode.

§ 1876. When a person is sworn, who believes in any other than the Christian religion, he may be sworn according to the peculiar ceremonies of his religion, if there be any such.

§ 1877. Any person who desires it, may, at his option, instead of taking an oath, make his solemn affirmation or declaration, by assenting, when addressed, in the following form: “You do solemnly affirm (or declare) that, &c., as in section 1873.

§ 1878. Whenever, by any provision of this code, an oath is required, an affirmation or declaration, as prescribed in the last section, is to be deemed equivalent thereto, and a false affirmation or declaration is to be deemed perjury, equally with a false oath.
