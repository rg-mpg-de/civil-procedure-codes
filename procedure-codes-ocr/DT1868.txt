person subscribing the summons may, at his option, by an endorsement on the summons, Ex a time for the service thereof,
and the service shall then be made «accordingl y.

Sec. 88. Where the person on whom
the service of the‘ summons is to be made cannot, after due

against the defendant in respect to whom the service is to be

unknown party or parties by publishing the same for six weeks,
once in each week successively, in the ofiicial paper of the Territory, and in a newspaper printed in the county where the premises are situated, provided a paper he published in such county,
and if no_paper be published in the county, then in a paper
published nearest the county seat of such county in the '1'er.r'i~
tory, which publication shall be equivalent to a personal service
on such unknown party or parties. i

against two or more defendants, and the summons is served -on
one or more. but-not on all of them, the plaintiff may proceed as

follows :
1. If the action be against defendants jointly indebted upon
contract, he -may proceed against the defendant served, unless

the court otherwise direct; and if he recover judgment, it may
be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted so far

only as that it may be enforced against the joint property ofalln _

and the separate property of the defendants served, and if they

served ; or,

2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may
proceed against the defendants served, in .the same manner as
if they were the only defendants.

3. if all the defendants have been served, judgment may be
taken against any or either of them severally, when the plainti&'

4. If the name of one or more parties shall, for any cause,
have been omitted in any action in which judgment shall have
passed against the defendants named in the summons, and such
omission shall not have been pleaded in such action, the plaintiff, in case the judgment therein shall remain unsatisfied, may
by action recover of such partner separately, upon proving his
joint liability, notwithstanding he may not have been named in
the original action; but the plaintiff shall have satisfaction of
only one judgment rendered for the same cause of action.

Sec. 90. In the cases mentioned
in section 88, the service of the summons shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time prescribed by therorder for
publication.

Sec. 91. Proof of the service~o-P the summons, and of! the complaint or notice,.i:t' any, aceompanying the*
same, must be as follows:

vice otherwise than by publication, the certificate, aihdavit or
admission must state the time and place of the service.

Sec. 92. From the time of the
service of the summons in a civil action, or the» allowance of a
provisional remedy, the court is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all the subsequent proceedings.

Sec. 109. Every pleading
in a court.of record must be subscribed by tl~e party or his attorney;
and when any pleading is verilied, every subsequent pleading, except
a demurrer, must be verified also.

Sec. 110. The verification must be to
the effect that the same is true to the knowledge of the person
making it, except as to those matters stated on information and belief, and, as to those matters, he believes it to be true, and must be
by the aiiidavit of the party, or if there be several parties united in
interest, and pleading together, by one at least of such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party be within the county where
the attorney resides, and capable of making the aiiidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the action or defence be founded upon a written instrumcntfor the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent or at' torney, or if all the material allegations of the pleading be within the ,
personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the pleading
is verified by any other person than the party, he shall set forth in
the aliidavit his knowledge, or the grounds of his belief on the sub- ,
,_ject, and the reasons why it is not made by the party. When a cor- l
Po;-ation is a party, the verification may be made by any oliieer there- i
of; and when the Territory, or any oflicer thereof in its behalf, is a 
party, the verilicatio,n may be made by any person acquainted with 
the facts. The verification may be omitted when an admission oi 1
the truth of the allegation might subject the party to prosecution for 1
felony. And .no pleading can be used in a criminal prosecution
against the party, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such
pleading. '

Sec. 111. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account
therein alleged; but he shall deliver to the adverse party, within
ten days after the demand thereof in writing. a copy of the account,
which, if the pleading is verified, must be veritied by his own oath,
or that of his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of
such agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true, or
be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, er a judge

‘,7,

thereof, may order a “ further account, when the one delivered is

defective; and the court may in all cases order a bill of particulars
of the claim of either party to be furnished.

Sec. 112. In the construction of a
pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegation

shall be liberally construed, with a view of substantial justice be»
tween the parties.

Sec. 113. If
irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be
stricken out, on motion of any person aggrieved thereby. And when
’the allegations of a pleading. are so indefinite or uncertain that the
precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the court may
require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment.

Sec. 114. In pleadinga judgment,
‘or other determination of a court or oliicer of special jurisdiction, it
shall not be necessary to ‘state ‘the facts conferring jurisdiction, but
such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly
given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party plead-_
ing shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction. ,

Sec. 115. Instrument for

l

_.A-I

01

payment of money only. In pleading the performance of conditions i

precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the-facts
showing such performance; but it may be stated generally that the
"party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegations be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. In an action
‘or defence founded upon an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a copy of the instrument,
and to state that there is due to him thereon from the adverse party a
specified sum, which he claims.

SEC. 116. In pleading a private statute, ora right derived therefrom,.it shall be sufiicient to revfer to such statute, by its title and the day of its passage, and the
‘court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof.

Sec. 117. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause
of action arose, but it shall be suilicicnt to state generally that the
same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiif, and if such
allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish,
on trial, that it was so published or spoken.

Sec. 118. In the actions mentioned in the
last section, the defendant may, in his answer, allege both thetruth

of the matter charged as defamatory’-and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages; and whether he prove the
justification or not, he may give,-in evidence, the mitigating circumstances.

Sec. 119. In an action~~to recover the possession of property distrained doing damage, an answer, that the defendant, or person by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed
of the real property upon which the distress was made, and that the
property distrained was. at the. time doing damage thereon, shall be
good, without settingforath the title to such real property.

Sec. 120. THe plaintiff unite in the same complaint several-‘can.

ses of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all rise out of’,

1, The same transaction, or transactions connected with the samesubject of action;

2, Contract, express or implied; or, ‘

3,, Injuries, with or without force, to person or property; oreither ;i

the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the same ; or

6, Claims torecover personal property, with or without damages
for the withholding thereof; or

7, Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by opera.
tion of law. But the cause of action, so united, must all‘belong toone of these. classes, and,.except in actions for the foreclosure of
mortgages, must affect all. the parties tothe action, and not require
different places »of' trial, and must be separately stated. In actions l
to foreclose mortgages the court shall--have power to adjudge and
direct the payment, by the mortgagor, of any. residue of they mutt.
gage debt that may remain unsatisfied after a saleof the mortgaged
premises, in cases in which the mortgagor shall he personally liable
for the debt secured by such mortgage; and if the mortgage, debt be
secured by the covenant or obligation of any._person.other than the
mortgagor, the plaintiff may make such person a party. to the action,
and the court may adjpdge payment of the residue of-‘such debt. remaining unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgagedpremises against
auch~,other person, and‘ may enforce judgment as in other cases. .

Sec. 121. Every

',,m.eria1?‘allegatiQn.of thiercomplaint, not controverted by the. answer,

.as prescribed in section 102, and every material allegation-of new
t matter in the answer, constituting a counter-claim, not controverted

:by the reply, as prescribed in section 106, shall, for purposes of the
action be taken -as true. But the allegation of new matter -in the
answer, not relating to a counter-claim, or of new-matter in a -reply,

is tovbe deemedcontroverted --bv the adverse party as «uponwaudirect

fdonial-or av0idance;~as thecasemay requlre.
