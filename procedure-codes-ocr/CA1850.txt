CHAPTER II.
0f the parties to Civil Actions.

§ 6. Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.

the correctness of which shall be certified by the Clerk. If there are several defendants, there shall be
a summons to each, accompanied with a copy of the complaint.

§ 24. The summons and the certificate, as to the correctness of the copy, shall be signed by the Clerk,
with his name of ofiice, and authenticated with the seal of the Court. The summons shall state the
Court in which the complaint is filed, and shall require the defendant to appear and answer the complaint
within ten days after the summons shall have been served upon him, when the defendant is served with
process in the county in which the suit is brought, or within thirty days after the service, when the
defendant is served with process in any other county. \Vhen there are several defendants, and any one
or more of them are served with process out of the county in which the suit is brought, all the defendants

appear by afiidavit that a cause of action exists against the defendant, in respect to whom the
serv'we is to be made, or that he is a necessary or proper party to any action, the Court or Judge may

publication to be made in some one or more newspapers, to be designated as most likely to give notice
to the person to be served, and for such length of time as the circumstances of the case may
require. In case of publication the Court or Judge shall also direct a copy of the summons and
complaint to be forthwith deposited in the post-oi‘n‘ce, directed to the person to be served at his place of
residence, unless it appears by adidavit that such residence is neither known to the party making the
application, nor can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him. If the summons shall not be
personally served on a defendant, he or his representatives shall (except in actions for divorce) be
allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within three
years after its rendition, on such terms as shall be just; and if the defence be successful, and the judgment,
or any part thereof, shall have been collected or otherwise enforced, such rendition may thereupon be
compelled as the Court shall direct. In all cases where publication is made, the summons as published,

statement of the complaint, and shall require the defendant to appear and answer at such time as shall
be directed by the order. When the defendant is out of the State, the publication shall be once a
month, for not less than six months.
§ 28. When service has been made, the summons shall be returned to the proper Court, within the
time in which the defendant is required to answer. If service is not made, the summons shall be
returned within thirty days after its date, when it is placed in the hands of the Sheriff of the county in
which it is issued, or within ninety days, if placed in the hands of any other Sheriff, or at such time as

§ 29. When a summons has been returned not served, the clerk shall at any time issue another on
' the application of the plaintiff or his attorney. _ .
§ 30. More than one summons may be issued at the same time; but in such case the plaintiff shall
not recover the costs of more than one.
§ 31. When the action is against two or more defendants, and the summons is served on one or
more, but not on all of them, the plaintitl' may proceed as follows :

against the defendant, served in the same manner as if all had been served, unless the Court shall

defendants, served in the same manner as if such defendant or defendants were the only parties proceeded
against.

service, it shall be equivalent to actual service, and no summons need issue.

subsequent proceedings. '

action stated therein.

§ 42. If the complaint be amended, a notice of the filing of the amended complaint shall be served
on the defendant or his attorney, who must answer it within five days. On proof of the service, and
there being no answer filed, the plaintiff may proceed to take judgment by default as in other cases.

§ 43. When any of the matters which are the causes of demurrer do not appear upon the face of the
complaint, the objection may be taken by answer. I

§ 44. If no such objection be taken either by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to

§ 45. The answer of the defendant shall contain—

lst, In respect to each allegation of the complaint controverted by the defendant, a general or specific

denial thereof, or a denial thereof according to his information and belief, or of any knowledge thereof

founded.

believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The Judge may order a further or
a more particular bill.

§ 54. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall
be liberally construed, and with a view'to substantial justice between the parties.

be bound to establish on the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction. '

§ 57. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts showing the performance ; but it may be stated generally, that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegations be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound
to establish on the trial the facts showing such performance.

§ 58. In pleading'a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be sudicient to refer to such
statute by its title, and the day of its approval, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice
thereof. .

§ 59. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic
facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which
the cause of action arose, but it‘shall be suliicient to state generally that the same was published or
spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to
establish on the trial that it was so published or spoken. 

§ 60. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the
truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances to reduce the amount of
damages ; and whether he prove the justilication or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating

circumstances.

parties to the action, and must be separately stated.

§ 62. When any complaint or answer is founded on any instrument of writing which is alleged to
have been signed by the party, the signature shall be considered as admitted, unless denied by such
party on oath. If denied, it may be proved by any proper evidence.

§ 63. Every material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer, shall, for the
purposes of the action, be taken as true. . .

§ 64. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof shall be deemed material,
unless it have actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defence
upon the merits. \Vhenever it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to
the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled, and thereupon the court may order
the pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just.

§ 65. When the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the
fact to be found according to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment without costs.

§ 66. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defence to which the proof is directed
is unproved, not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it shall not
be deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

§ 67. Any pleading ,may be once amended by the party of course, without costs and without
prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before the period for answering it shall expire, or
within five days after the answer to such pleading shall have been filed. 9

§ 68. The court may at any time, in furtherance of justice and on such terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of the party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting any other allegations
material to the cause, or by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited by
this Act, or by an order enlarge such time, and may also at any time within one year after notice
thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding taken against him through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission in any proceeding, and when
any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to the provisions of this Act, the
Court shall have power to permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable to
law. '

§ 69. After demurrer either party may amend any pleading demurred to of course and without
costs, filing the same amended, and giving notice thereof within five days to the adverse party, who
shall have tive days to answer or demur thereto, if the pleading be a complaint, or three days to demur
thereto if it be an answer; but a party shall not so amend more than once. When a demurrer to a
complaint is overruled, and there is no answer tiled, the Court may, upon such terms as shall be just,
allow the defendant to tile an answer. If a demurrer to the answer be overruled, the facts
alleged in the answer shall still be considered as denied. A demurrer only admits the facts for the
sake of an argument.

§ 70. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be
designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name; and when his true name shall be discovered,
the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

§ 71. The Court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the pleading or
proceedings which shall not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party, and no judgment shall be
reversed or affected by reason of such error or defect. § 72. The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed on motion to make a supplemental
complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint or answer,
or of which the party was ignorant when this former pleading was made.

debtor, or is indebted to him, the judge may by an order require such person, or corporation, or
company, or any olIicer or member thereof, to appear at a specitied time and place, and answer

debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such
interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an action against such person, company, or corporation, by
the receiver; but the Judge may by order forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or
interest, till a suflicient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action and prosecute the
same to judgment and execution; but such order may be modified or dissolved by the Judge granting
the same at any time on such security as he shall direct.

him, to report the evidence of the facts.

§ 223. The Judge may allow to the judgment creditor or to any party so examined (whether a party
to the action or not), witnesses’ fees and disbursements, and a fixed sum in addition, not exceeding in all
