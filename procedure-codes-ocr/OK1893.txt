act
shall
be
known
as
the
code
of
civil
pto-
cedure
of
the
Territory
of
Oklahoma.
§ 11. The common
law, as
modified by constitutional
and statutory
law, judicial
decisions and
the condition
and wants
of
the people,
shall remain
in
force
in aid
of the
general
Statutes
of Oklahoma;
but the rule
of the common
law, that
statutes in
derogation
thereof,
shall
be strictly
construed,
shall
not be
appli-
cable
to any general
statute
of Oklahoma;
but all such
statutes
shall be
liberally
construed
to
promote
their
object.
§ 11. Remedies
in the
courts
of justice
are divided
into: 
First,
Actions.
Second,
Special
proceedings. 
§ 11. An
action
is
an
ordinary
proceeding
in
a
court
of
justice
by
which
a
party
prosecutes
another
party
for
the
enforce-M 
ment or
protection
of a
right, the
redress
or prevention
of
a
wrong,
or the
punishment
of a public
offense.
§ 11. Every
other
remedy
is
a
special
proceeding.
§ 11. Actions
are
of
two
kinds:
First,
Civil.
Second, 
Criminal.
§ 11. A
criminal action is one prosecuted
by the Terri- 
tory
as a
party,
against
a
person
charged
with
a public
offense,
for the punishment
thereof.
§ 11. Every
other
is
a
civil
action.
§ 11. Where
the
violation
of
a right
admits
of both
a
civil
and
criminal
remedy,
the
right
to
prosecute
the
one
is
not
merged 
in
the
other.

against
whom
a judgment
or
order
has 
been
rendered,
without
other
service
than

which,
by it,
or in
consequence
of it,

during
the pendency
of the
action
the

had
notice
thereof
in
time
to
appear
in

and
make his
defense.
§ 11. In
actions
where
it
shall
be
necessary
to
make
the heirs
or devisees
of any
deceased
person
defendants,
and it 
shall
appear
by
the
affidavit
of the
plaintiff,
annexed
to
his
peti- 
tion,
that the
names
of such
heirs
or devisees,
or any
of them,
and
their
residence,
are
unknown
to
the plaintiff;
proceedings
may be
had
against
such
unknown
heirs
or
devisees,
without
naming
them;
and
the
court shall
make
such
order
respecting
service
as may
be
deemed
proper.
If service
by
publication
be
ordered,
the
publication

shall

not

be

less
than
three
weeks.
§ 11. Where the action is against two or more defendants,

and

one or
more shall have
been served,
but not all of
them, the
plaintiff
may
proceed
as follows:
First,
If
the
action
be
against
defendants
jointly indebted upon contract,
he may proceed against
the
defendants served, unless
the court otherwise direct;
and if
he recover judgment,
it may
be entered
against all the
defendants
thus jointly
indebted,
so far only as
that it may
be enforced
against
the joint property of all,
and the separate property
of the
defendants served;
and if they are subject
to arrest, against the
persons of
the defendants served. Second,
If the action be against
defendants
severally liable, he
may, without prejudice to his
rights
against those
not served, proceed against
the defendants served in
the same
manner as if the) were
the only defendants.
§ 11. Nothing
in this
code
shall
be
so
construed
as
to make a
judgment, against
one or more
defendants
jointly or
severally
liable, a bar to another action
against those not served.
§ 11. When
the
petition
has
been
filed,
the
action
is
pending, so as to charge
third persons with notice of
its pendency,
and while
pending no interest
can be
acquired by
third persons
in the
subject
matter thereof
as
against the
plaintiff's title;
but
such
notice
shall be of
no avail
unless the
summons
be served
or
the
first publication
made within
sixty
days after
the filing
of the
petition.
§ 2. When
any
part
of
real
property,
the
subject
matter of an
action, is situated in any, other
county or counties
than the one
in which the
action is brought,
a certified
copy of
the judgment
in
such action
must
be recorded
in the
office of
the
register
of deeds
of such
other county
or
counties,
before it
shall
operate
therein as
notice, so as
to charge third
persons,
as provided

in

the preceding section.
It shall operate
as such
notice,
without record, in
the county where it is
rendered.

heretofore 
existing 
in

actions
are

and
hereafter,
the forms
of pleadings
in civil
actions
in courts
of
record,
and the
rules
by which
their
sufficiency
may be
determined,
are those
prescribed
by this
code.
§ 11. The
only
pleadings
allowed
are:
First,
The
peti-
tion
by the
plaintff. Second,
The
answer or
demurrer
by the defendant.

Third,

The

demurrer
or reply
by the
plaintiff.
Fourth,
The
demurrer
by the
defendant
to
the reply
of
the plaintiff.
§ 11. The
petition
must
contain:
First. The name of the court, and the county in which the
action
is brought,
and
the names
of the parties,
plaintiff
and defendant,

followed

by

the
word
"petition."
Second, A statement
of the facts constituting
the cause of action,

in
ordinary
and concise
language,
and
without
repetition.
Third,
A demand
of
the relief
to which
the
party supposes
himself entitled.
If the
recovery of
money be
demanded, the
amount
thereof shall
be stated ; and,
if interest thereon
be claimed,
the time
from which
interest
is
to be computed
shall also
be
stated.
§ 11. Where
the
petition
contains
more
than
one
f",i.icause
of
action,
each
shall
be
separately
stated
and
numbered.
§ 11. The
defendant
may
demur
to the
petition
only
when it
appears on its face,
either: First,
That the court
has no
jurisdiction
of the
person of the
defendant, or
the subject
of the
action.
Second,
That
the plaintiff
has
no legal
capacity
to sue.
Third, That
there
is another
action
pending
between
the same
parties
for the same
cause.
Fourth,
That there
is a
defect of
parties,

plaintiff

or
defendant.
Fifth,
That
several causes
of
action
are improperly
joined.
Sixth,
That the petition
does not
state
facts
sufficient
to constitute
a
cause of
action.
§ 11. The demurrer
shall
specify
distinctly
the
grounds
of
objection
to the petition.
Unless
it do so,
it shall be
regarded
as
objecting
only that
the petition
does
not state
facts
sufficient
to constitute
a cause
of action.
'
§ 11. When
any
of
the
defects
enumerated
in section
eighty-nine
do not
appear upon
the face of the
petition, the ob-
jection
may
be taken
by answer;
and
if no objection
be
taken,
either
by
demurrer
or answer,
the defendant
shall
be deemed
to
have
waived the
same,
except only
the objection
to the jurisdiction

of

the
court, and
that the
petition
does not
state facts
sufficient

to

constitute
a cause of action.
§ 11. When a demurrer is sustained, on the ground of
misjoinder
of
several
causes
of
action,
the
court,
on
motion
of
the
plaintiff,
shall
allow
him,
with
or without
costs,
in its
discretion,
to
file several
petitions,
each
including
such
of
said causes
of
action
as
might
have
been joined;
and
an
action
shall be
docketed
for
each
of said
petitions,
and the
same
shall
be proceeded
in
without
further
service.
§ 11. The
defendant
may
demur
to
one
or more
oj
the several
causes
of
action
stated
in
the
petition,
and
answer
to
the
residue.
§ 11. The
answer
shall
contain:
First,
A
general
or
specific denial of each material allegation of the petition contro-
verted by the defendant. Second, A statement of any new matter
constituting a defense, counterclaim or setoff, or a right to relief
concerning the subject
of the action, in ordinary
and concise language,

and
without repetition.
Third,
When relief
is sought,
the
nature of the relief to which the defendant
supposes himself
entitled.
The defendant may set forth,
in his answer, as many
grounds of defense, counterclaim,
setoff, and for relief,
as he may
have,
whether they be such as
have been heretofore denominated
legal, or equitable, or both. Each must be separately stated and
numbered, and
they must refer, in an intelligible
manner, to the
causes
of
action
which
they are
intended
to
answer*
§ 11. The
counterclaim
mentioned
in
the
last section
must be one existing in favor
of a defendant and against a plain- 
tiff, between whoia
a several judgment might be
had in the action
and arising out of the contract
or transaction set forth
in the petition

as

the foundation of the
plaintiff's claim, or connected
with
the subject
of the action. The right
to relief concerning the subject

of the action,
mentioned
in the same section, must
be a right
to
relief necessarily or properly
involved in the action for
a complete

determination thereof,
or settlement of the question
involved
therein.
§ 11. If
the
defendant
omit
to
set up
a counterclaim 
or setoff, he cannot recover
costs against the 1laintiff
in any subsequent

action

thereon;

but
this section shall
not apply
to causes
of
action
which
are
stricken
out
of
or
withdrawn
from
the
ansver,
as in sections
ninety-seven
and one
hundred
and twenty.
§ 11. When it appears that a new party is neces-
sary to a final
decision upon
a counterclaim,
the court
may either
permit
the new party to be made
by a summons to reply
to the
counterclaim,
or may direct the counterclaim
to be stricken out
of the answer,
and made the subject
of a separate action.
§ 11. A
setoff
can only
be
pleaded
in
an action
found-
ed
on contract,
and must
be a cause
of action
arising upon
con- 
tract
or ascertained
by the
decision
of a court.
§ 11. When
it
appears
that
a new
party
is
necessary
to 
a final
decision
upon the
setoff, the
court
shall permit
the new
party to be made, if
it also appear that, owing
to the insolvency
or non-residence of the
plaintiff, or other cause, the
defendant
will be
in danger of
losing his claim,
unless permitted
to use
it as
a setoff.
§ 11. When
cross
demands
have
existed
between
persons
under such
circumstances
that, if one
had brought
an ac-
tion
against the other,
a counterclaim
or setoff
could have
been
set up,
neither can be
deprived of
the benefit thereof
by the
as-
signment
or
death
of the other;
but
the two
demands
must be
deemed compensated
so far as they
equal each
other,
§ 101. The guardian of an infant or person
of unsound
mind,
or
attorney
for a
person
in
prison,
shall
deny,
in
the answer,
all the
material
allegations
of
the
petition
prejudicial
to
such
de-
fendant.
§ 2. When
the
answer
contains
new
matter,
the
plaintiff
may
reply
to
such
new
matter,
denyhg-,
generally
or
specifically,
each allegation controvcrted
by him ;
and he may allege,

in ordinary
and concise language,
and without repitition,
any new matter
not inconsistent with the petition, constituting a
defense to such new matter in the answer; or he may demur to
the same for insufficiency, stating, in his demurrer,
the grounds
thereof ; and
he may demur to one or more of
such defenses set
up in the
answer,
and reply
to
the residue;
§ 103. If the
reply
to any
defense
set
up
by the
answer be insufficient,
the defendant may demur
thereto, stating
the grcunds
of such
demurrer.
§ 11. Where
the answer
contains new
matter consti-
tuting
a right
to
relief
against
a
co-defendant
concerning
the
subject of
the action, such
co-defendant
may demur
or reply to
such matter
in the
same manner
as
if he were
plaintiff,
and subject

to

the same
rules,
as far
as applicable.
§ 11. The answer
or demurer, by the defendant, shall
be
filed
within
twenty
days
after
the
day
on
which
the
summons
is returnable;
the
reply
or
demurrer
shall
be
filed
within
thirty
days
after
the day
on which
the summons
was
made returnable
the demurrer
to
the reply
shall
be
filed within
forty
days
after
the day
on which
the
summons
was
made
returnable.
§ 11. The
court,
or any
judge
thereof
in vacation,
may,
in his discretion,
and
upon such
terms
as may
be just,
allow
an answer
or reply
to be
made,
or other
act to
be done,
after
the
time
limited
by this
act, or by
an order
enlarge
such
time.
§ 11. Every
pleading,
in
a court
of
record,
must
be
subscribed
by
the
party
or
his
attorney.
§ 11. In
all
actions,
allegations
of
the
execution
of
written
instruments
and
indorsements
thereon,
of the
existence
of
a corporation
or
partnership,
or
of any
appointment
or
authority,

or
the

correctness

of

any

account
duly
verified
by the
affidavit

of
the party,
his
agent
or attorney,
shall be
taken
as true
unless

the

denial
of the
same be
verified
by the
affidavit
of the
party,
his,
agent
or
attorney.
§ 11. The
verification
mentioned
in
the
last section
shall.
not be required to the answer of
a guardian defending for
an. ihtent or
person of unsound
mind,
or a person
imprisoned.
§ 11. If
there
be
several
persons
united
in
interest
and
pleading
together,
the
affidavit
may
be made
by any
one of
such parties. When
a municipal or other corporation
is a party,
the
verification
may
be
made
by an
officer
thereof,
its
agent
or
attorney.
§ 111. The
affiiavit
shall
be
sufficient
if.
it state
that 
the
affiant
believes
the
facts
stated
in the
pleading
to
be
true. 
§ 11. In
all
cases
where
the
party
pleading
is a
non-
resident
of the
county
in
which
the
action
is brought,
or if
he 
shall
be absent
from
the
county
in
which
the
pleading
is filed,
an
affidavit,
made
before
filing
the
pleading,
stating
the
substance
of the
facts
afterwards
inserted
in the
pleading,
shall be
a sufficient

verification.

Such

affidavit

shall

be

filed

with
the
pleading
intended
to
be verified
thereby.
§ 11. The
affidavit
verifying
pleadings
may
be
made 
before
any
person
before
whom
a
deposition
might
be
taken,
and 
must
be signed
by the
party making
the same;
and
the officer
before

whom

the

same

was
taken,
shall
certify
that
it was
sworn
to
or affirmed
before
him,
and
signed
in his
presence.
The certificate

of

such
officer,
signed
officially
by
him,
shall
be evidence
that
the
affidavit
was
duly
made,
that
the
name
of the
officer
was
written by
himself,
and that
he was such
officer.
§ 11. When
the affidavit
is
made
by
the
agent
oi 
attorney,
it must
set
forth
the reason
why
it is not
made
by
the 
party himself.
It
can be
made by
the agent
or attorney
only;
First,
When the
facts are
within
the personal
knowledge
of
the
agent
or attorney.
Seconl,
When
the plaintiff
is an
infant,
or
of
unsound
mind,
or imprisoned.
Thir'd,
When
the pleading
to
be
verified
is founded
upon
a written
instrument
for
the payment
of
money
only,
and such
instrument
is in the
possession
of
the agent
or attorney.
Fourth,
When
the
party
is nota
resident
of,
or is
absent
from
the
county.
§ 11. In
the
construction
of
any
pleading,
for
the
purpose
of
determining
its
effect,
its
allegations
shall
be
liberally 
construed,
with
a view
to substantial
justice
between
the
parties,
§ 11. All
fictions
in pleadings
are abolished. 
§ 11. The title
of a cause shall not be changed
in
any
of
its
stages. 
§ 11. If
the
action,
counterclaim
or
setoff
be
founded 
on
account
or
on a
note,
bill, or
other
written
instrument
as
evi-
dence
of indebtedness,
a copy
thereof
must
be
attached
to
and
filed
with the
pleading.
If not
so attached
and
filed,
the reason
thereof
must
be stated
in
the pleading.
But
if the
action,
counterclaim

or

setoff
be
founded
on a
series
of
written
instrumnts
executed
by the
same
person,
it shall
be sufficient
to attach
and
file a copy
of
one only,
and
in succeeding
causes
of action
or
defenses,

to

set
forth
in general
terms
descriptions
of
the several
instruments
respectively.
§ 11. If
redundant
or
irrelevant
matter
be
inserted 
in
any
pleading,
it may
be
stricken
out,
on motion
of the
party
prejudiced
thereby;
and
when
the
allegations
of
a
pleading
are 
so
indefinite
and
uncertain
that
the precise
nature
of the
charge
or defense
is not
apparent,
the court
may require
the
pleading
to
be
made definite
and certain
by amendment.
§ 120. The court,
at any
time before
the
final sub-
mission
of tlhe
cause,
on
motion
of the
defendant,
may
allow
actaluseL
counterclaim
or setoff,
set
up
in the
answier,
tb
be wvithdrawn,
and
.
the same may
become the subject
of another
action; on motion
of
either
party,
to
be made
at the
time
such
counterclaim
or
setoff
is
withdrawn,
an action
on the
same
shall
be docketed
and
proceed-
ed
in,
as in
like
cases
after
process
served;
and
the
court
shall
direct
the
time
and
manner
of
pleading
therein.
If
an action
be
not
so
docketed,
it may
afterwards
be
commenced
in
the
ordinary
way.
§ 11. In
pleading
a judgment,
or
other
determina-
tion
of a
court
or officer
of special
jurisdiction,
it
shall
be suffi-
cient
to
state
that
such
judgment
or determination
was'duly
given
or made;
and
the
jurisdiction
of
any
such
court
or
officer
shall
be
presumed
until
the
contrary
appears.
§ 11. In pleading
the
performance
of conditions
precedent
in a
contract,
it
shall
be
sufficient
to
state
that
the
party
duly
performed
all the
conditions
on his
part;
and
if such
allegations
be
controverted,
the
party
pleading
must
establish,
on
the
trial,
the
facts
showing
such
performance.
§ 11. In
an
action,
counterclaim
or
setoff,
founded
upon
an account,
promissory
note,
bill
of exchange
or
other
instrument,

for

the

unconditional

payment

of

money

only,

it

shall
be
sufficient
for
a
party
to give
a copy
of
the
account
or instrument,

with

all

credits,
and
the indorsements
thereon,
and
to
state
that
there
is due
him,
on
such
account
or
instrument,
from
the
adverse
party,
a
specified
sum,
which
he
claims,
with
interest.
When
others
than
the
makers
of
a promissory
note,
or the
acceptors

of

a

bill

of

exchange,

are

parties

in

the

action,

it

shall
be
necessary to state,
also, the kind
of liability of
the several parties,
and
the
facts,
as they
may
be,
which
fix
their
liabiiity.
§ 11. In
pleading
a
private
statute,
or
a
right
de-
therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by
its title,
and
the
day
of
its
approval,
and
the
court
shall
there-
upon
take
judicial
notice
thereof.
§ 11. In
an
action
for
libel
or
slander,
it
shall
be
upsufficient
to
state,
generally,
that
the
defamatory
matter
was
published

or

spoken

of

the

plaintiff;

and

if

the
allegation
be
denied,
the
plaintiff
must
prove,
on
the
trial,
the
facts,
showing
that
the
defamatory
matter
was
published
or
spoken
of
him.
§ 11. In the
actions
mentioned
in the
last section,
de-the
defendant
may
allege
the
truth
of
the
matter
charged
as
de-
famatory,
and
may
prove
the
same,
and
any
mitigating
circumstances,

to

reduce

the

amount

of

damages,

or

'he
may
prove
either.
§ 11. In any
action
for the
recovery
of
real
property,
descrip-ir
shall
be
described
with
such
convenient
certainty
as will
enable
an
officer
holding
an
execution
to.
identify
it.
§ 128. Every
material
allegation
of
the
petition,
not
controverted
by the
answer,
and
every
material
allegation
of new
matter
in
the
answer,
not
controverted
by
the
reply,
shall,
for
the
purposes
of
the
action,
be
taken
as true;
but
the
allegation
of
new
matter
in the
reply
shall
be
deemed
to
be
controverted
by
the
adverse

party,

as

upon

direct

denial

or

avoidance,

as

the

case

may
require.
A demurrer
to a reply shall
not be held to admit
any of
the facts
alleged
in
such
reply
for any
purpose
olher
than
to
de.
termine
the sufficiency
thereof.
Allegations
of value,
or
of
amount
of damages,
shall
not be
considered
as
true,
by failure
to
controvert
them; but
this
shall not
apply
to the
amount
claimed
in actions
on
contract,
express
of
implied,
for
the
recovery
of
money
only.
§ 11. A
material
allegation,
in
a pleading,
is
one
es- 
sential
to the claim
or defense,
which could
not be stricken
from
the pleading
without leaving it
insufficient.
§ 11. Neither
presumptions
of
law
nor
matters
of 
which
judicial
notice is taken,
need
be stated
in the pleading. 
§ 11. When
a tender
of
money
is
alleged
in
any 
pleading,
it shall not
be necessary
to deposit
the money in
court
when
the pleading is filed, but
it shall be sufficient if the
money
is deposited in court at
trial, or when ordered by
the court.
§ 11. If
an original
pleading
be lost,
or withheld
by
any
person,
the court
may allow
a copy thereof
to be
substituted. 
§ 11. No
variance
between
the
allegations,
in
a
pleading,
and
the
proof,
is
to
be
deemed
material,
unless
it
have 
actually
misled
the adverse party,
to his prejudice,
in maintaining
his action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged
that a party
has been so misled, that
fact must be proved to the
satisfaction
of the court, and
it must also be shown in what
respect

he has
been misled,
and thereupoh
the court may
order the
pleading to be amended,
upon such terms
as may be jnst.
§ 11. When the variance is not material, as provided 
in
the last section,
the
court
may
direct
the fact
to
be found,
ac- 
cording
to the
evidence, and
may order
an immediate
amendment

wfthout cost.
§ 11. When,
however,
the
allegation
of
the
claim
or
defense,
to which the proof
is directed,
is unproved, not
in some 
particular
or particulars
only, but
in its general
scope and
meaning,

it is not
to be deemed
a case of
variance within
the last two sections, but
a failure of
proof.
§ 11. The
plaintiff
may
amend
his
petition
without 
leave,
at
any
time
before
the
answer
is filed,
without
prejudice
toberore
the
proceedings;
but
notice of
such amendment
shall be
served
upon
the defendant
or his attorney,
and
the defendant
shall have
the same time
to answer or demur thereto
as to the original petition.
§ 11. At
any
time
within
ten
days
after
the
demur- 
rer
is filed,
the
adverse
party
may
amend,
of course,
on
payment 
of
costs
since filing
the
defective
pleading.
Notice
of
the filing
of an
amended
pleading
shall be
forthwith
served
upon the
other
party
or his
attorney,
who
shall
have the
same
time
thereafter
to
answer
or
reply
thereto,
as to
an original
pleading.
§ 11. Upon
a
demurrer
being
overruled,
the
party
who
demurred
may
answer
or
reply,
if the
court
be satisfied
that 
he
has
a meritorious
claim
or
defense,
and
did
not
demur
for
delay.
§ 11. The court, may, before or after judgment, in 
furtherance
of
justice,
and
on
such
terms
as may
be
proper,
amend
any pleading, process
or proceeding by adding
or striking out
the
name
of any
party,
or correcting
a mistake
in
the name
of
a
party, or
a mistake in
any other
respect, or by
inserting other
allegations
material
to the case,
or conform
the pleading
or proceeding

to the facts proved, when such amendment does not
change
substantially
the
claim or
defense;
and when
any proceeding
fails

to conform,
in any respect, to the
provisions of this
code, the court may permit the same to be made conformable
thereto by amendment.
§ 11. The
court,
in
every
stage
of
action,
must
dis-
regard
any
error
or
defect
in the
pleadings
or
proceedings
which
does
not affect
the substantial
rights
of
the adverse
party;
and
no
judgment
shall
be
reversed
or affected
by reason
of such
error
or defect.
§ 141. If the
demurrer be sustained, the adverse
party
may
amend,
if
the
defect
can
be
remedied
by
way
of
amendment,
with or
without
costs,
as the
court,
in its discretion,
shall
direct.
§ 11. When
either party
shall amend
any
pleading
oy
proceeding,
and
the
cGurt
shall
be satisfied,
by
affidavit
or
otherwise,
that
the adverse
party
could
not be
ready for
trial, in
consequence
thereof,
a continuance
may
be granted
to some
day
in term,
or to
another
term of
the court.
§ 11. When
the
plaintiff
shall
be
ignorant
of
the
name of
a defendant,
such
defendant
may
be designated,
in any
pleading
or
proceeding,
by
any name
or description;
and when
his
true
name
is discovered,
the pleading
or
proceeding
may
be
amended
accordingly.
The plaintiff,
in such
case,
must state
in
his
petition
that
he could
not
ascertain
the true
name;
and
the
summons
must
contain
the words,
"real
name unknown,"
and a.
copy
thereof
must be
served
personally
upon
the defendant.
§ 11. Either party
may be allowed, on notice, and
on
such
terms,
as
to
costs,
as
the
court
may
prescribe,
to
file
a
supplemental
petition,
answer
or reply,
alleging
facts material
to
the case,
occuring
after the former
petition,
answer or
reply
§ 11. Whenever
two or
more
actions
are
pending
in
the
same
court,
which
might
have
been
joined,
the
defendant
may,
on motion and
notice to the
adverse party,
require
him to
show cause
why the
same shall not
be consolidated,
and if
no
cause
be shown, the
said several
actions shall
be consolidated,
§ 11. The
order
for
consolidation
may
be
made
by
the
court,

by
a
judge

than five nor
more
than ten days thereafter.
In case other bail be given,

in
an action
against

sheriff
shall

bail a written
acknowledgment

sheriff's acknowledgment of
the surrender, to the
clerk of the court, an exoneration of the bail shall be entered on
his undertaking.
§ 11. For the
purpose
of surrendering
the
defendant
the
bail,
at
any
time
and
place,
before
he

copy of the undertaking, may empower any person of suitable

age
and
discretion
to
do so.

bail
shall
be
exonerated
by

court, or by his surrender
to the sheriff of
the county in
which he was ar-rested in execution
thereof, within
the time fixed
in section one hundred and
sixty-eight; or within
such further time as the court, in which the action is pending, may
allow.

hundred
and
sixty-one,

is brought,

the bail has been given
and adjudged suf-
ficient,
shall direct that the
money deposited be
refunded to the
defendant,
and

same
applicant,
by
a court

injunction
granted
by
a
judge,
may

undertaking
has
removed
from
the
territory,
or is inaufficient,
the court

the
injunction,
sjnless,
in a
reasonable
time,
sufficient
security

Issues
of fact

TIALS BY JURY.
§ 11. The
general
mode
of
summoning
the
jury
is
such
as
is
or
may
be
provided
by
law, 
§ 11. If there shall
be impaneled,
for the trial of any
cause, any
petit juror, who
shall have been
convicted of
any crime 
which
by law
renders
him
disqualified
to serve
on a
jury ;
or who
has
been arbitrator
on either
side, relating
to
the same
controversy;

or

who

has
an interest
in the
cause ; or
who has
an action
pending
between
him and
either
party; or
who has
formnrly
been a juror
in the same
cause ; or who
is the employer,
emflx
,
counselor,
agent,
steward
or attorney
of either
party
; or who
is
subpoenaed
as a
witness
; or who
is of
kin to
either
party;
or any
person
wh
o shall have
served
once already
on
a jury, as
a talesman

on the
trial of any
cause, in
the same
court during
the term,
he may
be challenged
for
such causes
; in
either of
which cases
the same
shall
be considered
as
a principal
challenge,
and
the
validity
thereof
be tried
by the
court;
and any
petit juror
who
shall
be returned
upon
the trial
of any
of the causes
hereinbefore
specified,
against
whom no
principal
cause
of cliallenge
can
be
alleged;
may, nevertheless,
be challenged
on
suspicion
of preju-
dice
against, or
partiality
for either
party,
or for want
of competent

knowledge

of
the English
language,
or any other
cause
that
may render
him,
at the
time, an
unsuitable
j-ror
; and the
validity
of such
challenge
shall be
determined
by
the court.
§ 283. The
plaintiff
first,
and
afterward
the
defendant, 
shall
complete
his
challenges
for cause.
They may
then,
in turn, 
in the
same
order, have
the right
to challenge
one
juror each,
until

each
shall

have

peremptorily
challenged
three
jurors,
but no
more.
§ 11. After
each
challenge,
the
vacancy
shall
be
filled before further challenges are made; and any new juror thus
introduced
may
be challenged
for cause
as well
as peremptorily.
§ 11. When
the
requisite
number
of
jurors
cannot 
otherwise
be obtained,
the sheriff
shall select talesmen
to supply
the deficiency from the bystanders,
or the body of the
county, as
the court may direct.
§ 11. The
jury
shall
be
sworn
to
well
and
truly
try 
the
matters submitted to them
in the case in hearing, and
a true
verdict
give, according to
the law and the evidence.
§ 7. When
the jury has
been sworn,
the trial
shall
oIproceed
in
the following
order
unless
the
court
for special
reasons
otherwise
directs:
First,
The party on
whom rests
the burden of
the issues may
briefly state his case, and
the evidence by which he
expects to
sustain it.
Second, The adverse party
may then briefly state
his defense,
and the
evidence
he expects
to offer in
support of
it.
Third,
The party
on whom
rests the burden
of the issues
must
first produce
his
evidence;
after
he has closed
his
evidence
the
adverse
party may interpose
and file
a demurrer
thereto, upon
the
ground
that no
cause of action
or defense
is proved. If
the court
shall sustain
the demurrer, such judgment
shall be rendered
for
the party demurring
as the state of the
pleadings or the proof
shall
demand.
If the demurrer
be overruled,
the adverse
party
will then produce
his evidence.
Fourth, The
parties will
then be confined
to rebutting
evidence
unless the court, for
good reasons in furtherance
of justice, permits

them
to offer evidence in
their original case.
Fifth, When
the evidence is concluded
and either party desires

special instructions to be given to the jury, such instructions
shall be reduced to writing, numbered, and signed by the party
or his attorney asking the same, and delivered to the court. The
court shall give general instructions to the jury, which shall be in
writing, and be numbered,
and signed by the judge,
if required
by either party.
Sixth, When
either party asks special instructions
to be given
to the jury,
the court shall either
give such instructions as
requested,

or

positively refuse to
do so; or give the instructions
with modification in such
manner that it shall distinctly
appear
what instructions were
given in whole or part,
and in like manner
those refused,
so that either party may except
to the instructions
as asked
for, or as modified, or to the
modification, or to the
re-
fusal.
All instructions
given by the court
must be signed
by the
judge; and filed together
with those asked
for by the'parties as
a
part
of the
record.
Seventh.
After the instructions
have
been given
to the jury
the
cause may be argued.
§ 11. A
party
excepting
to
the
giving
of
instructions,
Exepuontoor
the
refusal thereof,
shall not
be required
to file a formal
bill of
exceptions; but it shall be sufficient to write at the
close of each
instruction, "Refused and excepted
to," or, "Given and excepted
to," which
shall
be signed
by the
judge,
§ 11. Whenever,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
is
proper
for the
jury to
have a view
of the
property
which
is the
subject
of litigation,
or of
the place
in which
any
material
fact
occurred,
it may
order
them
to be
conducted,
in a body,
under
the charge
of
an officer,
to
the
place,
which
shall
be shown
to
them by some person appointed
by the court for that purpose.
While
the
jury are
thus
absent,
no person,
other
than the
person
so
appointed,
shall
speak to
them on
any subject
connected
with
the
trial.
§ 11. When
the
case
is finally
submitted
to the
jury,
they
may
decide
in
court
or
retire
for
deliberation.
If
they
re- 
(
4
tire, they
must be kept
together,
in some
corvenient
place,
under
charge of an officer,
until they agree upon a
verdict or be dis-
charged
by the court, subject
to the discretion of the court
to
permit them to separate
temporarily at night, and at
their meals.
The officer having them under his charge shall not suffer any
communication
to be made to
them, or make any himself,
except
to ask them if they are agreed upon their verdict, unless by order
of the court: and he shall not, before their verdict is rendereJ,
communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, or the
verdict agreed upon.
§ 11. If
the
jury
are
permitted
to
separate,
either 
during the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall
be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse
with, or suffer themselves to be addressed by, any other person,
on any subject
of the trial, and that it is
their duty not to form
or express
an opinion thereon, until
the case is finally submitted
to them.
§ 29. After
the
jury
have
retired
for
deliberation,
if
there
be a disagreement
between
them as
to any part
of the
tes- 
timony,
or if they desire to be
informed as to any part of
the law
arising in the case, they
may request the officer to
conduct them
to
the court,
where
the information
on
the point
of law
shall be
given in
writing, and
the court may
give its recollections
as
to
the testimony
on the point in dispute,
in the presence of, or after
notice to,
the parties or
their counsel.
§ 11. The
jury
may
be
discharged
by
the
court
on
account
of
the sickness
of a
juror, or
other accident
or
calamity
requiring
their discharge,
or
by consent
of both
parties,
or after
they
have been kept
together until
it satisfactorily
appears
that
there
is no probability
of their
agreeing.
§ 11. In
all
cases
where
the
jury
are
discharged
dur- 
ing
the
trial,
or
after
the
cause
is
submitted
to
them,
it
may
be
tried again
immediately,
or at a future
time, as the
court may
direct.
§ 11. When
the
jury
have
agreed
upon
their
verdict 
they
must be
conducted
into court,
their
names called
by the
clerk,
and
their verdict
rendered
by
their foreman.
When
the
verdict is
announced,
either
party
may require
the
jury to
be
polled,
which
is done
by the clerk
or the
court asking
each
juror
if
it is his verdict.
If any one
answers in
the negative,
the jury
must again
be sent
out, for further
deliberation.
§ 11. The
verdict
shall
be
written,
signed
by
the 
foreman
and read
by the
clerk to
the jury,
and the
inquiry
made
whether
it is
their verdict.
If
any juror
disagrees,
the jury
must
be
sent out again
; but if no
disagreement
be expressed,
and
neither
party
requires
the jury
to
be polled,
the
verdict
is complete

and

the jury
discharged from
the case.
If, however,
the
verdict
be defective
in form
only,
the same
may,
with
the
assent
of
the jury,
before
they are
discharged,
be corrected
by the
court.
VERDICT.
§ 297. The
verdict
of
a
jury
is
either
general
or
special.
A
general verdict.is
that by.which
they
pronounce
generally
ujion
all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.
special verdict
is that by which
the jury finds facts
only.
It must present
the facts as established by
the evidence, and not
the evidence
to prove them; and they must
be so presented as
that nothing remains
to the court but to draw
from them conclu-
sions
of
law.
§ 11. In
all cases
the
jury
shall
render
a
general
ver-
ueslions;dict,
and
the
court
shall
in
any
case
at
the
request
of
the
parties
thereto, or either of
them, in addition to the general verdict,
direct

the
jury to find
upon particular
questions of
fact, to be stated
in writing by the party or parties
requesting the same.
§ 11. When the special
finding of facts
is inconsist-
with the general
verdict, the former controls
the latter and
the court may give
judgment accordingly.
§ 11. When,
by
the
verdict,
either
party
is
entitled
awsessamountto
recover
money
of
the
adverse
party,
the
jury,
in
their
verdict,
must assess
the amount of
recovery.
§ 11. The trial by
jury may be
waived by the
parties,

in

actions
arising
on
contract,
and
with the
assent
of the
court in
other actions, in the following
manner: By the consent
of the party appearing,
when the other party
fails to appear at the
trial by himself or attorney.
By written consent,
in person or by
attorney,
filed
with
the
clerk.
By
oral
consent,
in
open
court,
entered on the journal.
§ 11. Upon
the trial of questions of fact by
the court,
it shall
not
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
state
its
findings,
except
generally,
for the
plaintiff or
defendant, unless
one of the
parties
request it,
with the view of excepting
to the decision of the court
upon the questions
of law
involved in the
trial; in which
case the
court shall
state, in writing,
the conclusions
of fact
found, sepa-
rately from the
conclusions
of law.
§ 303. All or
any
of the
issues
in the
action,
whether
of
fact
or
of
law,
or
both,
may
be
referred,
upon
the
written
consent

of
the parties, or
upon their
oral consent
in court, entered
upon the journal.
§ 11. When
the
parties
do
not
consent,
the
court
may,
upon the
application
of either,
or of
its own
motion,
direct
a reference
in either of
the following
cases: Where
the trial of an
issue of fact
shall require
the examination
of mutual
accounts, or
when
the account
is on one side
only, and
it shall be made
to appear

to

the court that
it is necessary
that the
party on the
other
side should
be examined
as a witness
to prove
the account;
in
vhich case the referees
may be directed to hear
and report upon
he whole issue, or upon
any specific question of
fact involved
therein;
or where the taking of
an account shall be necestary
for
the information of the court before judgment, in cases which may
be
determined
by
the
court,
or
for
carrying
a judgment
into
effcet.
or where a question of fact other than upon the pleading, shall
arise, upon motion
or otherwise, in any stage of
an action.
§ 11. A
trial
before
referees
is
conducted
in
the 
same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same power
to summon
and enforce the attendance
of witnsses, to administer
all

necessary oaths in the trial of the case, and to grant ad-
journments,
as the court. upon such
trial. They must state the
facts
found and the conclusions
of law separately, and their
decisions

must be given, and may be excepted to and reviewed in
like manner. The report of the referees upon the whole issue
stands as the decision of the court, and judgment may be entered
thereon in the
same manner as if the action
had been tried by the
court. When the referee is to report the facts, the report nas the
effect of a special verdict.
§ 11. In
all cases
of
reference,
the
parties,
except
when
an
infant
may
be
a
party,
may
agree
upon
a
suitable
person 
or persons, not exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered

accordingly ;
and if the parties do not agree,
the court shall
appoint one or more referees, not exceeding three, wvho shall be
free from exception.
§ 11. It shall
be
the duty
of
the
referees
to
sign
any
true
exceptions
taken
to any
order or
decision
by them
made
in 
the case, and return the same, with their report, to the court making
the

reference.
§ 11. A
judge,
in
vacation,
upon
the
written
con-
sent
of the parties, may make
an order of reference which
the
court of which he is a member
could make in term time.
In such
case, the order of reference
shall be made on
the written agreement
of

the parties
to refer, and shall be
filed with the clerk of
the court,
with the other
papers in the case.
§ 11. The
referees
must
be
sworn
or
affirmed
well
and faithfully to hear
and examine the
cause, and to make
a just!""'
and true report therein,
according to the best of
their understand-
ing. The oath
may be administered by
any person authorized
to take depositions.
§ 11. The
referees
shall
be
allowed
such
compensa-
tion for their
services as the
court may
deem just
and proper,
which shall be
taxed as part of
the costs in the
case.
§ 11. An exception
is
an
objection
taken
to a
decis- 
ion
of
the
court
or
judge
upon
a
matter
of
law.
§ 11. The party
objecting
to the
decision must
ex- 
cept at the time the decision
is made, and time may
be given to
reduce
the exception
to
writing,
but not beyond
the
term. If
the decision
objected
to is
made in
vacation
or at chambers,
the
judge
may give
time to reduce
the
exception
to writing,
not
ex
ceeding ten days.
§ 11. No
particular
form
of
exception
is
required,
The
exception
must be
stated,
with so much
of the
evidence
as is
necessary to
explain it, and
no more, and
the whole as
briefly as
possible.
§ 11. Where
the decision
objected
to is
entered
on
the record,
and the
grounds of objection
appear
in the entry,
the
exception may
be taken by the
party causing
to be noted, at
the
end of
the decision,
that
he excepts.
§ 11. Where the decision is not entered on the
record, or the grounds of objection
do not sufficiently appear in
the entry,
the party
excepting
must
reduce his
exceptions
to
writing,
and present
it to
the judge for
his allowance.
If true,
it shall
be the
duty of
the judge
to allow
and sign
it; whereupon
it shall
be filed with
the pleadings
as a
part of the
record, but
not
spread
at large
on the journal.
If the writing
is
not true,
the
judge
shall correct
it,
or suggest
the correction
to
be made,
and
it
shall
then
be signed
as
aforesaid.
§ 11. No
exception
shall
be
regarded,
unless
it
is
material
and
prejudicial
to
the
substantial
rights
of the
party
excepting.
§ 317. Exceptions
taken
to the
decision
of
any
court
of
record
may,
by
leave
of
such
court,
be
withdrawn
from
the
files
(

by
the party
taking the

at any time
before
the proceedings
in
error
are
commenced.

§ 11. A new
trial
is a
re-examination,
in
the same
court,
of
an
issue
of
fact,
after
a
verdict
by
a
jury,
report
of
a
referee,
or a decision
by
the court.
The
former
verdict,
report
or
decision shall
be vacated,
and
a new
trial granted,
on
the ap-
plication
of the
party
aggrieved,
for
any of
the
following
causes,
affecting
materially
the
substantial
rights
of such
party:
First, Irregularity in the
proceedings of the court,
jury, referee,
or prevailing
party,
or any
order of
the court
or referee,
or abuse
of
discretion,
by which
the party
was
prevented
from having
a
fair
trial.
Second,
Misconduct
of
the jury or
prevailing
party.
Third, Accident or surprise,
which ordinary prudence
could not
have
guarded
against.
Fourth, Excessive damages, appearing to have been given un-
der the
influence
of passion
or prejudice.
Fifth,
Error
in
the
assessment
of
the
amount
of
recovery,
whether
too large or too small, where
the action is upon a contract,

or
for the injury
or detention
of
property.
Sixth, That the verdict,
report or decision is not
sustained by
sufficient
evidence,
or is contrary
to
law.
Seventh, Newly-discovered evidence, material for the party applying,
which

he could not,
with reasonable diligence,
have discovered

and

produced

at
the

trial.
Eighth, Error of law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by
the
party
making
the application.
§ 11. A new
trial
shall
not
be granted
on account
grnte;of
the
smallness
of
the
damages,
in
an
action
for
an
injury
to
the
person
or reputation,
nor in any
other action
where the
damages
shall
equal the
actual pecuniary
injury
sustained.
§ 11. The
application
for
a
new
trial
must
be
made
Ivucationat
the
term
the
verdict,
report
or decision
is rendered
; and,

of newly discovered
evidence,
material for
the
,party
applying,
which
he
could
not,
with
reasonable
diligence,
have
discovered
and
produced
at
the
trial,
shall
be
within
three
days
after
the
verdict
or
decision
was
rendered,
unless
unavoidably

prevented.
§ 11. The
application
must
be
by
motion,
upon
written
grounds,
filed
at the
time of
making
the motion.
The 
causes
enumerated

and
seven,
of section
three
hundred
and
eightern,
must
be sustained
by affidavits,
showing

their

truth,
and
may be
controverted
by affidavits.
§ 11. Where
the
grounds
for
a
new
trial
could
not, 
with reasonable
diligence,
have been
discovered
before,
but
are
discovered
after
the term
at which
the verdict,
report
of
refere
or decision
was rendered
or made,
the application
may be
made
by petition,
filed as in other
cases, not
later than the
second term
after discovery;
on which
a summons

the case
shall be heard
and summarily
decided
at the
ensuing
term, and
if in term,
it shall be heard
and decided
after
the expiration
of twenty days
from such
service. The
case shall
be placed
on the trial docket,
and the
witnesses
shall be examined

in

open court,
or
their depositions
taken as
in other
cases;
but
no such petition
shall be filed
more than
one year after
the
final
judgment

§ 11. Whenever
damages
are
recoverable,
the
plain-, 
tiff may claim and

to which he may
be entitled
for the cause of action
established.
§ 11. The
provisions
of this article
respecting
trials 
by
jury
apply,
so
far
as
they
are
in
their
nature
applicable,
to 
trials by
the court.
§ 11. A
trial
docket
shall
be
made
out
by
the
clerk 
of court, at least
twelve days before the
first day of each term of
the court,
and the actions shall be
set for particular days in the
order
hereinafter stated, and
so arranged that the cases
set for
each day shall be tried as nearly as may be on that day, namely:
First, Issues of fact to be tried by a jury; second, issues of fact
to be tried by
the court; third, issues of
law. If the defendant
fails
to answer or demur, the
cause, for the purpose of this section,

shall be deemed to be at issue upon questions of fact; but
in every such case the plaintiff
may move for and take
such judgment

as he is entitled
to on the defendant's default
on or after the
day on which
said action shall be set for
trial. No witnesses
shall be subpoenaed in any case while the cause stands upon issue
of law; and whenever the court shall regard the demurrer in any
case as frivolous, and put in for delay only, no leave-to answer or
reply shall be given, unless upon payment of all costs then accrued
in the action.
§ 11. The
trial
of
an
issue
of
fact,
and
the
assess- 
ment of damages
in any
case, shall be
in the order
in which they
are
placed
on
the
trial
docket,
unless
by
the
consent
of
the
parties

or
the order
of the
court they
are continued
or
placed
at the
heel
of the docket,
unless
the
court, in
its discretion,
shall
other-
wise direct.
The court
may, in its discretion,
hear
at any time
a
motion,
and may
by rule prescribe
the time for
hearing motions.
§ 11. Actions shall
-be triable at the first term
of
the court after the
issues therein by the times
fixed for pleadings
are, or shall
have been madc up ten days before the term. When
issues
of law are made
up either
before or during
a term of
court,
but
after the period
for preparing
the trial docket
of such
term, the
clerk shall place
such actions
on the trial docket
of that term;
and when
any demurrer
shall be adjudged
to be
frivolous, the
cause
shall stand for hearing or
trial in like manner as if
an issue
of fact had been joined in
the first instance; but the court may,
in its discretion,
fix specially the
time when such cause shall
stand for trial.
§ 32. The
court
may,
for
good
cause
shown,
continue

an action at any stage
of the proceedings, upon such terms
as may be just. When a continuance is granted on account of the
absence of evidence, it shall
be at the cost of the party
making
the
application,
unless
the court
otherwise
order.
§ 11. A
motion
for
a
continuance,
on
account
of the
absence
of evidence, can be made
only upon affidavit, showing
the
materiality of the evidence
expected to be obtained,
and that
due diligence has been used
to obtain it, and where
the evidence
may be; and if it is
for an absent witness, the affidavit
must show
where
the
witness
resides,
if
his residence
is known
to the
party,
and the probability
of procuring his
testimony within a reasonable
time,
and what facts he believes
the witness will prove, and
that
he believes them to be true.
If thereupon, the adverse
party will
consent that on the
trial the facts alleged in the
affidavit shall be
read and treated
as the deposition of the
absent witness, or that
the facts
in relation to other evidence
shall be taken as proved
to
the
extent alleged in the affidavit,
no continuance shall be
granted
on the ground of the
absence of such
evidence.
§ 11. The
clerk
shall
make
out
a
copy
of
the
trial
docket for the
use of the bar, before the
first day of the term of
court.

to the
amount of
their respective
demands. In all other cases,
the writ of execution

first
delivered to the officer shall
be first satisfied. And
it
shall
be the duty
of the officer
to indorse on
every writ
of execu-
tion
the time
when he
received
the same;
but nothing
herein
contained

shall
be so construed
as to affect
any preferable
lien which
one or more
of the
judgments,
on
which execution
issued,
may
have
on the
lands of
the judgment
debtor.
§ 462. The officer to whom
a writ of execution is de-
livered, shall
proceed immediately
to
levy the same
upon the
goods and
chattels of the
debtor; but
if no goods and
chattels can
be found,
the officer
shall indorse on
the writ of
execution,
-.No
goods,"
and forthwith
levy the writ
of execution
upon the
lands
and
tenements
of the
debtor,
which may
be liable
to satisfy
the
judgment; and
if any of the
lands and
tenemente of
the debtor
which
may
be liable
shall be
incumbered
by
mortgage
or any
other lien
or liens, such
lands and
tenements may
be levied upon
and appraised
and
sold, subject
to
such lien
or liens,
which
shall
be stated
in the
appraisement.
§ 11. If
the
officer,
by
virtue
of
an
execution
issued
from
any
court
of
record
in
this
Territory,
shall
levy
the
same
on,,
any
goods
and
chattels
claimed
by
any
person
other
than
the
de- 
fendant, or be requested by the plaintiff to levy on any such
goods and chattels,
the officer may require the
plaintiff to give
him an undertaking,
with good and sufficient
securities to pay
.all costs
and damages that he may sustain
by reason of the detention

or

sale of such
property;
and until such
undertaking
shall be
given,
the officer
may
refuse to
proceed
as against
such property.
§ 11. In all
cases where a sheriff, coroner
or other 
officer shall,
by virtue
of
an execution,
levy
upon
any goods
and
chattels
which
shall remain
upon
his hands
unsold,
for want
of
bidders,
for the
want of
time to
advertise
and sell,
or any
other
reasonable
cause,
the officer may,
for his own
security, take
of
the
defendant
an undertaking,
with
security,
in
such
sum as
he
may deem
sufficient,
to the
effect that
the said
property
shall
be
delivered
to the officer
holding
an execution
for the sale
of the
same,
at the
time and
place
appointed
by said
officer,
either by
notice, given
in writing,
to
said defendant
in execution,
or
by
advertisement,
published
in
a newspaper
printed
in the
county,
-naming
therein
the day
and place
of sale.
If the
defendant
shall
fail to
deliver the
goods
and chattels
at the
time and
place men-
tioned in
the notice to him
given, or to
pay to the officer
holding
the execution
the full
value of said
goods and
chattels, or
the
amount
of said
debt and
costs, the
undertaking,
given
as afore-
said,
may
be
proceeded
on
as in
other
cases.
§ 11. The
officer
who
levies
upon
goods
and
chattels,
by
virtue
of
an
execution
issued
by
a
court
of
record,
before
he proceeds
to sell the
same shall cause
public notice
to
be
given of the
time and
place of sale,
for at least
ten days
before

the day of sale. The
notice shall be given by advertisement,
published in some
newspaper printed
in the county, or,
in case no
newspaper
be
printed therein,
by
setting up
advertisements
in five
public places
in the county.
Two advertisements
shall be
put up
in the township
where the sale is to
be held; and where goods
and
chattels levied upon cannot
be sold for want of bidders,
the
officer making such return
shall annex to the execution
a true and
perfect inventory of
such goods and chattels,
and the plaintiff in
such execution
may thereupon sue out another
writ of execution,.

the sale
of the property
levied upon
as aforesaid;
but
such goods and chattles
shall not be sold, unless
the time and
place
of sale be advertised,
as hereinbefore
provided.
§ 11. When
any
writ shall
issue,
directing
the
sale
of
property
previously
taken
in execution,
the officer
issuing
said
writ shall, at
the request
of the person
entitled to
the benefit
thereof,
his agent
or attorney,
add thereto
a command
to theofficer

to
whom such
writ shall be
directed, that
if the property
remaining
in his hands
not sold
shall, in his opinion,
be insufficient
to
satisfy
the judgment,
he
shall levy
the same
upon
lands and
tenements,
goods
and
chattels,
or
either,
as
the law
shall
permit,
being
the property
of the
judgment
debtor,
sufficient
to satisfy
the debt.
§ 11. If
execution
be
levied
upon
lands
and
tenements,

the

officer

levying

such

execution

shall

call

an

inquest

of
three disinterested
househodders,
who shall
be resident
within the
county
where the
lands
taken in
execution
are situate,
and
administer

to

them
an oath,
impartially
to appraise
the* property
so
levied on, upon
actual view;
and such
householders
shall forthwith

return
to said officer,
under their
hands, an estimate
of the
real value of said property.
§ 11. That
if the
words
"appraisement
waived,"
or
Appraise-other
words
of similar
import,
shall be
inserted
in any deed,
mortgage, bond,
note, bill
or written
contract hereafter
made,
any

sold thereunder-
without
appraisement;
and
such judgment,
and
any process
is-

a copy thereof
with the clerk
of the court from which
the
writ
issued,
and
advertise
and
sell
such
property,
agreeably 
to the provisions
of this article.
§ 11. If,
upon
such
return,
as
aforesaid,
it
appear, 
by
the
inquisition,
that
two-thirds
of
the
appraised
value
of
said
lands and
tenements,
so levied upon,
is sufficient
to satisfy
the
execution,
with
costs,
the judgment
on
which
such
execution
issued
shall
not
operate
as
a lien
on
the residue
of
the debtor's
estate,
to
the
prejudice
of
any
other
judgment
creditor;
but
no
such property
shall be
sold
for less
than
two-thirds
of
the value
returned
in
the inquest;
and nothing
in this section
contained
shall,
in
anywise,
extend
to affect
the
sale of
lands
by the

or on account
of, any
moneys
that now
are, or
may hereafter
be,
by them
collected

or received in their
official capacity, the property
so levied
on shall be sold without valuation.
§ 11. Lands
and
tenements
taken
on
execution
shall
not be
sold until the
officer cause
public notice
of the time
and
place
of sale
to be
given, for
at least
thirty days
before
the day
of sale, by advertisement
in
some newspaper
printed in
the county,
or, in case
no newspaper
be printed
in the
county, in
some newspaper

in

general
circulation
therein,
and
by putting
up an
advertisement

upon

the
court-house door,
and in five
other public
places
in the county,
two of which
shall be
in the township
where such
lands and tenements
lie.
All sales made
without such
advertise-
ment
shall be set aside,
on motion,
by the court

the return
of
any writ
of 
execution,

satisfaction
of
which
any lands
or
tenements
have been sold, shall, after having carefully examined the pro-
ceedings of
the officer, be
satisfied that
the sale has,
in all respects,
been made
in conformity
to the
provisions of
this article,
the
court
shall direct
the clerk to make
an entry
on the journal

the
court is

deed for such
lands and tenements;

and
the officer,
on making such
sale, may
retain the purchase

his hands until
the court shall
have examined
his
proceedings
as
aforesaid,
when
he
shall
pay
the
same
to
the
person
entitled
thereto, agreeably
to
the order of
the court.
§ 11. The sheriff
or other
officer
who, upon
such 
writ
or writs of execution,
shall
sell the said lands
and tenements,
or
any part
thereof,
shall make
to the
purchaser
as
good and
sufficient
deed of
conveyance

whom
such
writ
or
writs
of
execution
were
issued
could
have made
of the same,
at or any time
after they

be sufficient
evidence
of
the legality of
such sale, and the proceedings
therein, until the
contrary
be
proved,
and shall
vest in
the purchaser
as
good and
as perfect
an estate
in the
premises
therein
mentioned,

liable to
the satisfaction
of
the judgment
; and
such
deed of

other
officer,

executions,
or the substance
thereof,
and
the names
of the
parties,
the amount
and
date of
rendition
of
each judgment,
by
virtue whereof
the
said lands
and
tenements
were sold
as aforesaid, and
shall be executed,
acknowledged

and

recorded

as

may be provided
by law, to
perfect
the
conveyance
of real
estate in
other cases.

The officer
who levies upon
goods and chattels,
or
lands
and
tenements,
or
who
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
selling

the

same,
by virtue
of any
writ of
execution,
may refuse
to
publish
a notice
of the
sale thereof,
by advertisement
in a
news-
paper,
until
the party
for whose
benefit
such execution
issued, his
agent
or attorney,
shall advance
to such officer
so much money
as
will be
sufficient
to discharge
the
fees of
the printer
for publishing
such

notice.
§ 11. Before
any
officer
shall
be
excused
from
giving
the
notification,
mentioned in
the last section,
he shall demand

the party
for whose
benefit the execution
was
issued, his agent

tenements
under
execu-
tion
shall
be
held
at
the
court
house,
in
the
county
in
which
such
lands and
tenements are
situated. No
sheriff or other
officer making

the sale
of property, either
personal
or real, nor any
appraiser
of
such property,
shall, either
directly or indirectly,
purchase
the
same;
and every
purchase, so made,
shall be
considered fraudulent

and

void.
§ 11. If lands
or tenements,
levied on as
aforesaid,
are
not
sold
upon
one
execution,
other
executions
may
be
issued
to
sell the
property
so
levied
upon.

§ 479. In all cases
where
two
or
more executions
shall
'ls." be put into the hands of any sheriff or other officer, and it shall
be necessary to levy
on real estate to satisfy the
same, and either
of the
judgment
creditors,
in whose
favor
one
or more
of said
executions

are

issued,
shall
require
the sheriff
or other
officer to
levy
said execut
ions, or so many
thereof as
may be required,
on sepa-
rate parcels
of the real
property of
the judgment
debtor or
debtors,
giving
to the officer making
the levy
on behalf of
the creditor,

whose

execution
may, by
the provisions
of this article,
be
entitled
to a preference,
the choice
of such part
of the real property

of the judgment
debtor or debtors, as will
be sufficient, at
two-thirds of the appraised
value, to satisfy
the same; and in all
cases where two or more executions, which are entitled to no
preference over each other, are put into the hands of the same
officer,
it shall be the duty of
the officer, wvhen required,
to levy
the same on separate parcels of the real property of the judgment
debtor or debtors, when, in the opinion of the appraisers, the
same niay
be divided without
material injury;
and if the real
property
of
said debtors
will
not be sufficient,
at two-thirds
of its
appraised value,
to satisfy
all the executions
chargeable
thereon,
such
part of
the same
shall
be
levied
on, to
satisfy
each execution,

as

will

bear
the
same
proportion
in
value
to the
whole,
as
the
amount
due to
the execution
bears
to the
amount
of
all the
executions
chargable
thereon, as
near as may
be, according
to the
appraised
value
of each
separate
parcel of
said real
property.
§ 11. If
the
term
of
service
of
the
sheriff
or
other 
officer who has
made, or shall
hereafter make
sale of any
lands and
tenements,
shall expire,
or if
the sheriff
or other
officer shall
be absent,
or

be rendered
unable, by death or otherwise,
to make a deed
of conveyance
of the
same,
any
succeeding
sheriff
or
other
officer,
on
receiving a
certificate from
the court from
which the
execu-
tion issued for
the sale of said lands and tenements,
signed by the
clerk, by
order of said court, setting
forth that sufficient proof
has been made to the court that said sale was fairly and legally
made; and on
tender of the purchase money,
or if the same or
any part thereof be paid, then, on proof of such payment and
tender
of the balance, if any,
may execute to the said purch
iser
or purchasers,
or his
or their legal
rep-esentatives,
a deed of
conveyance

of said lands
and tenments so sold.
Such deed shall be
as good
and valid in
law, and have
the same effect,
as if the sheriff

or
other officer
who made
the sale had
executed the
same.
§ 11. If,
on
any
sale
made
as
aforesaid,
there
shall
be in the hands
of the sheriff or other officer more
money than is 
sufficient
to satisfy the
writ or writs
of execution,
with interest
and
costs, the sheriff or other
officer shall, on demand,
pay the
balance
to the defendant
in execution,
or
his legal representatives.
§ 11. If any
judgment
or
judgments,
in
satisfaction
of
which
any
lands
or
tenements
are
sold,
shall
at
any
time
there- 
after
be reversed, such reversal
shall not defeat or affect
the title
of the purchaser
or purchasers;
but. in
such cases,
restitution
shall be
made, by the judgment creditors,
of the money, for which
such lands
or tenements
were sold,
with lawful
interest from
the
day of sale.
§ 11. No judgment
heretofore
rendered,
or which 
hereafter
may
be
rendered,
on
which
execution
shall
not
have
been taken
out and levied before the
expiration of one year next
after
its rendition,
shall operate
as a lien
on the estate
of any
debtor, to the
prejudice of any other judgment
creditor. But in
.all cases
where judgment has been or
may be rendered in the supreme

court, and a special mandate awarded to the district court
to carry the same into execution,
the lien of the judgment
cred-
itor shall
continue for one
year after
the first clay
of the term of
the district court
to which such mandate
may be directed. Nothing
in

this section
contained shall
be construed
to defeat the
lien
of
any judgment creditor who
shall fail to take out execution
and
cause a levy
to be made, as
herein provided,
when
such faihire
shall be occasioned
by appeal,
proceedings
in error,
injunction, or
by vacancy
in the office
of sheriff
or coroner, or
the disability
of
such
officer,
until
one year
after
such disability
shall
be removed.
In all cases where
real estate has been or
may hereafter be taken
on execution and appraised,
and twice advertised and
offered for
sale, and shall remain unsold for the want of bidders, it shall be
the duty of the
court from which such
execution issued, on
mo-
tion
of the plaintiff,
to set aside such
appraisement and
order a
new one
to be made, or to set aside
such levy and appraisement
and award
a new execution
to issue, as
the case may require.
§ 11. The
sheriff
or
other officer,
to whom
any
writ
of execution
shall
be
directed,
shall
return
such
writ
to
the
court
to which the same is returnable, within sixty days from
the date
thereof.
§ 11. In all cases
where
judgment
is rendered
in any
court
of
record
within
this
Territory,
upon
any
instrument
of
writing in which two or
more persons are jointly
and severally
bound,
and it shall
be made
to appear
to the
court, by
parol or
other testimony,
that
one or
more of
said persons
so bound,
signed
the same as surety or bail,
for his or their co-defendant,
it shall
be the duty of the
clerk of said court, in recording
the judgment
thereon,
to certify which
of the defendants
is principal debtor,
and which
are sureties or
bail. And
the clerk of
the court
afore-
said
shall issue
execution
on such
judgment,
commanding
the
sheriff or
other officer
to cause
the money
to be
made of the
goods
and chattels,
lands and
tenements, of
the principal
debtor; but
for want
of sufficient
property
of
the principal
debtor
to make
the
same,
that
he cause
the same
to be
made of
the goods
and
chattels,
lands
and
tenements,
of the
surety
or bail.
In all
cases,
the
property,
both personal
and real,
of the principal
debtor,
within
the jurisdiction
of the court,
shall be exhausted
before
any
of
the property
of the surety
or bail shall
be taken in execution.
§ 11. Each
householder,
summoned
to appraise
real
"eestate
under
the
provisions
of
this chapter,
shall
be
allowed
and
receive
for his
services the
sum of fifty
cents for each
day he may
be so
engaged as such
appraiser,

on the execution
by virtue of which
the property appraised
was levied on,
if claimed
at the time
of making
the return
of such
appraisement.
And
when any
householder,
summoned
as aforesaid,
shall
fail to appear
at the
time or
place appointed
by the officer,
and
discharge
his
duty as

and
prosecuted
as in other
cases; but
the goods
and chattels,
lands and
tenements
of any such

cases
where
a

death
of
a person
under
arrest
in
an
exe- 
cution
does
not
satisfy
the
judgment;
but
an
execution
may
issue
thereon
as if
no arrest
had
been
made. 
§ 11. If
a
person,
imprisoned
under
an
order
of
ar- 
54
rest
made
before
judgment,
is
not
charged
in execution,
within
ten days
after
ju igment,
he shall
be discharged
from
such
im-
prisonment.
§ 11. In cases of commitment
under this article, or
upon
arrest
before
or
after
judgment,
in
civil
cases,
the
person
imprisoned,
in case
of his inability
to
perform
the act
or to endure

the
imprisonment,
may
be discharged
from
imprisonment
by
the court
or judge
committing
him,
or the
court or
judge thereof
in which
the judgment
was or might
be
rendered,
on such
terms
as
may be
just.

§ 531. If the
execution
be for
the
delivery
of
the
possession
of
real
or
personal
property,
it
shall
require
the
officer
to deliver
the same,
particularly
describing
the property,
to
the
party
entitled
thereto,
and
may,
at
the
same
time,
require
the
officer
to satisfy any
costs or
damages, recovered
in
the same
judgment,
out of the goods and chattels
of the party against whom
it was rendered
; and,
for the want
of such goods
and chattels,
then out of the
lands and tenements
; and
in this respect
it shall
be
deemed
an
execution
against
the property.
§ 532. When
the
judgment
is
not
for
the
recovery
of
money
or real
property,
the same
may
be
enforced
by
attachment,

by

the
court rendering
judgment,
upon motion
made,
or
by a rule of
the court upon
the defendant
; but in
either case,
notice of
the motion or
a service of a
copy of the
rule shall be
made on
the defendant,
a
reasonable
time before
the
order of
attachment

is made.
§ 11. In
special
cases,
not
hereinbefore
provided
for,
the execution
shall
conform
to the judgment
or
order of
the
court. When a judgment
for any specified amount,
and also for
the sale
of specific real
or personal
property, shall
have been
rendered,
and an
amount,
suflicient
to satisfy
the amount
of the
debt
or damages and
costs, be
not made from
the sale of
property

specified,

an
execution may
issue for the
balance, as
in other
cases.

§ 11. In
all
cases
in
which
a
judgment
shall
be
rendered

by

a

justice
of
the
peace,
the party
in
whose
favor
the
judgment
shall
be
rendered
may
file
a transcript
of such
judgment
in the
office of the
clerk of the
district court
of the county
in
which
the
judgment
nv
s rendered;
and
thereupon
the
clerk
shall,
on the
day on which
the same
shall be filed,
enter the case
on the
appearance
docket,
together with
the amount
of the
judgment
and time
of filing
the transcript;
and shall
also enter
the same
on
the judgment
docket,
as in case
of a judgment
rendered
in the
court
of which
he is
clerk.
§ 11. Such
judgment
shall
be
a
lien
upon
the
real
estate of
the judgment
debtor,
from
the day
of filing the
tran- 
script,
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
if
the
judg-
ment
had been
rendered
in the district
court.
§ 11. Execution
may
be
issued
thereon,
to
the
sher- 
iff,
by the clerk
of the court,
in the
same manner
as
if the judgment

had

been

taken

in

court;
and
the sheriff
shall
execute
and
return
the
same,
as other
executions
;
and in
case
of sale
of
real
estate,
his
proceedings
shall
be examined
and approved
by the
court as in other cases.
§ 11. The
justice
of
the
peace
shall
certify
on
the
transcript the amount,
if any, paid on such
judgment.
§ 11. If
such
judgment
becomes
dormant,
or
if
any 
of
the parties
thereto
die before
the same
is satisfied,
it may
be
revived
in the same
manner
as other
judgments
in
the district
court;
and a certified
copy
of the
entry of
such transcript
may
be
filed
in the office
of the clerk
of the district
court of
any other
county, and shall
be a lien on the real estate
of the debtor in such
county, from the date of the filing of such copy.

Provided,
That if
any promissory
note, bearing
a
lawful rate of
interest, shall have been taken
for any such labor
or material, it shall
not be necessary to file an
itemized statement
of labor or material furnished,
but in lieu thereof it
shall be sufficient

to

file a copy of such note,
with a sworn statement that
said
note, or any part thereof, was given for such labor or material
used in the construction of such building or improvement; and if
the whole of such note shall have been given for such labor or
material, the lien shall be for the whole of the principal and interest

of said note; but if a part of said note only shall have been
given for such labor or material, then the lien shall be for a corresponding

note. Such
statement shall be filed

date
upon which material was
last furnished or labor last
performed

under contract as
aforesaid; and if the claim
be for the
planting of any trees,
vines, plants, or hedge,
such statement
shall be filed

court
shall enter a record of the
same in a book kept for that
purpose,

to be called the mechanics'
lien docket, which
docket shall
be ruled
off into separate
columns,
with headings
as follows:
-When
filed," "Name
of owner,"
''Name of claimant,"
"Amount
claimed,"
"Description of property,"
and 'Remarks," and the

furnish
any
such
ma-
terial
or perform
such
labor
under
a sub-contract
with
the con- 
tractor,
or as an artisan
or day
laborer in the
employ of such
contractor,
may
obtain
a lien
upon
such
land
from
the
same
time,
in
the same manner, and to the
same extent as the original
contractor,
for

the
amount due
him for such
material and
labor; and
any
artisan or day
laborer in
the employ
of such sub-contractor
may obtain a
lien upon such land from the
same time, in the same
manner,
and to the
same extent
as the sub-contractor,
for the
amount
due him
for such material
and labor,
by filing
with the
clerk of the district court
of the county in which the
land is situated,

within
sixty clays
after the date
upon which material
was last
furnished
or labor last
performed under
such sub-contract,

due from the
contractor
to the claimant,

lien is claimed; and by serving
a notice in writing of the
filing
of such lien
upon the owner
of the land:
Provided,
That if
with due diligence
the owner cannot be found
in the county where
the land
is siituated, the claimant, after
filing an affidavit setting
forth
such facts,
may serve a
copy of such
statement upon
the oc
cupant of the
land, or if the land be unoccupied,
may post such
copy in a conspicuous
place upon the land
or any building thereon.

Immediately

upon the filing
of such statement the
clerk of
said court shall enter a record of the same
in the docket provided
for
in section six
hundred and fifty
of this act, and
in the manner
therein
specified: Provided, That
the owner of any land
affected
by such lien shall not thereby become liable to any claimant for
any greater amount than he contracted to pay the original contractor;

but

the risk of all payments
made to the original
contractor

shall
be upon such owner
until the expiration of
the sixty
days hereinbefore
specified; and no
owner shall be
liable to an
action by such contractor
until the expiration of said
sixty days,
and
such owner may
pay such sub-contractor
the amount due
him
from
such contractor for such
labor and material, and the
amount
so paid shall be
held and deemed a payment
of said amount to the
original
contractor. The district
clerk shall be entitled
to a fee
of twenty-five
cents in
each case for
entering the
statements
provided

for in this act, and
the costs of filing and
entering such
statement
shall
be recovered
as part of the
costs of
enforcing
such liens.
§ 11. All
claims
for
liens
and
rights
of
action
to
re-
cover
therefor
under
this act shall
be assignable
so
as to vest
in
the
assignee
all rights
and remedies
herein
given,
subject
to all
defenses
thereto
that
might
be made
if such assignment
had not
been made.
Where
a statement
has
been
filed and
recorded
as
herein provided,
such assignment
may
be made by
an entry, on
the same
page of the
mechanics' lien
docket containing
the
record

of

the lien,
signed
by the
claimant
or his lawful
representative,

and

attested
by
the clerk;
or such
assignment
may
be made
by a separate
instrument in writing.
§ 11. Any
lien
provided
for
by
this
act may
be
enforced

by

civil action
in the district
court of the
county in which
the
land is situated,
and
such
action shall
be brought
within
one
year
from
the time
of the filing
of said
lien with
the clerk
of said
court:
Provided,
That
where
a promissory
note is
given
such action

may
be brought

time
within one
year
from the

said
note.
The
practice,
pleading
and proceedings
in
such
action
shall conform
to the
rules prescribed
by the
code of
civil procedure
as far as
the same
may be
applicable;
and
in case
of action
brought,
any
lien
statement
may
be
amended
by
leave
of
court
in furtherance
of
justice
as pleadings
may
be in
any matter,

except

as

to

the
amount
claimed.
§ 11. In
such
actions
all
persons
whose
liens
are
filed

provided,
and
other
incumbrances,
shall
be
made
parties,
and
issues
shall
be made
and trials
had
as
in other
cases.
Where
such action
is brought
by
a sub-contractor,
or other per-
son
not
the
original
contractor,
such
original
contractor
shall
be
made
a party
defendant,
and shall
at his
own expense
defend
against the claim
of every sub-contractor,
or
other person claiming

a lien under
this act, and
if he fails
to make such
defense the
owner may
make the same
at the expense
of such
contractor; and
until
all such
claims, costs
and expenses
are finally
adjudicated,
and defeated
or satisfied, the owner
shall be entitled
to retain
from the contractor
the amount thereof, and
such costs and expenses

as he may
be required to pay: Provided, That if the sheriff
of the county in which such action is pending shall make return
that he is unable to find such original contractor, the court may
proceed to adjudicate the liens upon the land and render judg-
ment
to enforce the
same with costs.
§ 11. If several
actions
brought to
enforce
the liens 
herein provided for are pending at the time, the court may order
them to be consolidated ; and in any action brought to enforce a
lien under this act, if the building or other improvement is still
in course
of construction, the court,
on application of any party
engaged
in furnishing labor or
materials for such building
or in'provement,

may stay the
trial thereof for a reasonable
time to
permit the filing
of a lien statement
by such party under
the provisions

of

this
act.
§ 11. In
all
cases
where
judgments
may
be
rendered
in favor
of any person
or persons to
enforce a lien
under the
pro-
visions of this act, the real
estate or other property
shall be ordered

to be
sold as in other
cases of
sales of real estate,
such sale
to
be without
prejudice
to
the
rights
of
any
prior
incumbrances,
owner or other
person
not a party
to the action.

§ 57. In
any
action
brought
by
any
artisan
or
day 
laborer to enforce
any lien
under this act,
where judgment
be rendered

shall be
entitled to
recover a reasonable

attorney's

fee,
to be fixed

taxed
as costs
in the action.
§ 11. If any
lien or liens shall be filed under
the pro- 
visions
of
this
act
and
no
action
to
foreclose
any
of
such
liens
shall have
been commenced,

court of the
county in which
said land
is
situated,
making said
lien claimants
defendants
therein, and
praying

for
an

adjudication
of said
lien or liens
so claimed, and
if any
such lien claimant
shall fail
to establish
his lien, the
court may
tax against
said claimant
the whole,
or such portion
of the costs
of such
action as may
be just : Provided,
That
if no action
to
foreclose
or adjudicate
any lien
filed under the
provisions
of this
act
shall be instituted
within
one year from
the filing of
said lien,
the clerk of
the district court
shall enter
under the head
of "Remarks,"
in

the

mechanics'
lien docket
hereinbefore
named, that
said
lien
is cancelled
by limitation
of
law.
§ 11. If
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
be
insufficient

pay all the
claimants, then
the court
shall order them
to be paid
in proportion
to the
amount
due each.
§ 11. The

file such
bond in
the office
of
said clerk;
and when
such bond is
so approved
and filed no
lien
shall attach under
this act, and if when such
bond is filed liens
have already been filed, such
lien shall be discharged.
Suits may
be
brought on said bond
by any person interested.
§ 11. That whenever any public officer shall, under
the

any such case or in any other case where a divorce is refused, the
court may for good cause shown make such order as may be proper
for the custody, maintenance and education of the children, and
for the control
and equitable division and
disposition of the property

of the parties, or of either of them, as may be proper, equitable

and
just,

having
due regard
to the time
and manner
of ac-
quiring
such
property,
whether
the title
thereto
be
in either
or
both of said parties.
§ 11. After a petition
has been
filed in an
action
for divorce and alimony,
or for alimony alone,
the court, or a
judge thereof
in vacation, may make
and enforce by attachment
such order to restrain the disposition of the property of the parties
or of either
of them, and for the use,
management and control
thereof, or for the control of the children and support of :he wife
during
the pendency of the action,
as may be right and
proper;
and
may also make such order
relative to the expenses of
the suit
as will insure
to the wife an efficient preparatioi
of her case; and
on granting
a divorce in favor of the
wife or refusing one on the
application
of the
husband,
the
court
may
require
the husband
to
pay
such reasonable
expenses
of the wife
in the
prosecution
or defense

of

the
action
as
may
be
just
and proper,
considering
the
respective
parties
and
the means
and
property
of each.
§ 11. When
a divorce
is
granted,
the
court
shall
make
provision
for
guardianship,
custody,
support
and
education
of
the minor
children
of
the marriage,
and
may
modify
or
change
any
order
in
this
respect,
whenever
circumstances
render
such
change
proper.
§ 11. When
a divorce
shall
be
granged
by
reason
of
the fault
or aggression
of the
husband,
the
wife
shall
be
restored
to
her
maiden
name
if
she
so
desires,
and
also
to
all
the
property,
lands,
tenements,
heriditaments
owned
by her
before
her marriage

or

acquired
by
her
in
her
own
right
after
such
marriage,
and
not
previously
disposed
of, and
shall
be
allowed
such
alimony
out
of the
husband's
real
and
personal
property
as
the
court
shall
think
reasonable,
having
due regard
to the
property
which
came
to
him
by
marriage
and
the
value
of
his real
and
personal
estate
at
the time
of
said
divorce
; which
alimony
may
be
allowed
to
her
in real
or
personal
property,
or
both,
or by
decreeing
to her
such
sum
of money,
payable
either
in gross
or in
installments,
as the
court
may
deem
just
and
equitable.
If
the
divorce
shall
be
granted
by
reason
of
the
fault
or
aggression
of
the wife,
the court
shall order
restoration
to her
of the
whole
of her
property,
lands,
tenements
and heriditaments
owned
by her
before, or
by her
separately
acquired
after
such
marriage,
and not
previously
disposed

of,

and
also such
share of
her husband's
real
and personal
property,
or both, as to the court may
appear just and reasonable;
and she shall
be barred of all right in all
the remaining lands of
which her husband
may at any time have been
seized. And as
to such property, whether
real or personal, as shall havebeen
acquired

by

the parties jointly during
their marriage, whether
the title thereto
be in either or both of
said parties, the court shall
make such division
between the parties respectively
as may appear

just

and

reasonable,

by

a division
of the
property
in
kind,
or by setting the same apart
to one of the parties, and
requiring
the
other thereof
to pay such
sum as may
be just and proper
to
effect a fair
and just division thereof.
But in case of a finding
by
the court, that
such divorce should be granted
on account of the
fault or aggression of
the wife, the court may in
its discretion set
apart such a
portion of the
wife's separate
estate as
may seem
proper
for the
support of the
children, issue
of the marriage.
§ 11. A
divorce
granted
at the
instance
of
oneparty
shall operate as a dissolution of the marriage contract as to both,
and shall be a bar to
any claim of the party for
whose fault it was
granted in or to the property of the other, except in cases where
actual fraud
shall have been committed
by or on behalf of the
successful party. Every
judgment of divorcement
granted by a
district court shall be final
and conclusive, unless appealed
from
within the time and in the manner
herein provided. A party desiring

to
appeal from
a judgment
granting
a
divorce,
must within
ten
days after
such
judgment
is renderqd
file a
written
notice in
the office of the clerk of such court, duly entitled in such action,
stating that
it is the intention of such
party to appeal from such
judgment; and
unless such notice be filed
no appeal shall be had
or
taken in such
cause, if notice
be filed as
aforesaid, the
party
filing the
same may commence
proceedings
in error
for the re-
versal or modification of
such judgment at any time
within four
months
from the date
of the decree
appealed from,
and not thereafter;

but

whether

a

notice be
filed as
herein provided,
or not, or
whether
proceedings
in error be
commenced
as
herein provided,
or inoti it
shall be
unlawful
for either
party to
such divorce
suit
to
marry
any
other person
within
six months
from
the date
of the decree

of

divorcement;
and if notice
be
filed and
proceedings
in
error
be commenced
as
hereinbefore
provided,
then
it shall
be
unlawful
for either
party
to such cause
to marry
any
other person
until the expiration
of thirty
days from
the day on
which final
judgment
shall be rendered
by
the appellate
court
on such
appeal;
and <:xery
person
marrying
confrary
to
the provisions
of this section

shall
be deemed
guilty
of bigamy,
and
such
marriage
be
absolutely

void.
§ 11. Every
person
convicted
of
bigamy
as such
offense

as
defined in the foregoing section
shall be punished
by im-
prisonment
in the penitentiary
for
a term of not
less than one
year nor more
than three
years.
§ 11. Every
decree of
divorce shall
recite the day 
and date when the judgment was rendered
in the cause, and thattarea.
the decree does
not become absolute and
take effect until the expiration

of

six

months

from

said

time..
§ 11. When
either
of
the
parties
to
a marriage
shall
be incapable, from want of age or understanding, of contracting
such marriage, the same may be declared void by the district
court, in an action brought by the incapable party; but the children

of such marriage, begotten before the same is annulled, shall
be legitimate. Cohabitation after such ir -ipacity ceases, shall be
a sufficient defense to any such action.
§ 11. The
wife
may
obtain
alimony
from
the
hus- 
band without a divorce, in an action brought for that purpose in
the district court, for any of the causes for which a divorce may
be granted. The husband may make the same defense to such
action as he might to an action for divorce, and may, for sufficient
cause, obtain a divorce from the wife in such action.
§ 11. Upon
the
trial
of
an
action
for
a divorce,
or
for alimony, the court may admit proof of the admissions of the
parties to be received
in evidence, carefully
excluding such as
shall appear to have been obtained by connivance, fraud, coercion

or other
improper means. Proof
of cohabitation, and reputation

of
the

marriage of the parties,
may be received as evidence
of the marriage. But no divorce shall be granted without proof.
§ 11. A
wife
who
resides
in
this
Territory
at
the 
time
of
applying
for
a
divorce,
shall
be
deemed
a
resident
of
this:
Territory, though her husband resides elsewhere.
§ 11. In
any
action
for
a
divorce
hereafter
tried,
the 
parties
thereto, or either
of them,
shall be competent
to tes- 
tify in like manner, and respecting any fact necessary or proper
to
be proven,
as parties
to other
civil
actions
are
allowed
to testify.

court,
or any
justice
or judge
thereof,

during

term,

or

to any

to
compel
the performance
of
any
act
which
the law
specially
enjoins
as
a duty,
resulting
from
an office,
trust or
station;
but
though
it may
require
an
inferior
tribunal
to
exercise its
judgment
or proceed
to the discharge
of
any of its
functions,
it cannot
control judicial
discretion.
§ 11. This
writ
may not
be
issued in
any
case where
there is
a plain
and adequate
remedy
in the
ordinary
course
of the
law.
It may
be issued
on
the information
of the
party
beneficially

interested.

§ 718. The
writ is
either alternative
or peremptory. 
The
alternative
writ
must
state,
concisely,
the
facts,
showing
the
oerenptory
obligation
of
the defendant
to perform
the act,
and his
omission
to perform
it, and
command
him
that
immediately
upon
the receipt

of

the

writ,
or at
some
other
specified
time,
he
do the
act
required
to
be performed
or show
cause
before
the
court whence
the
writ
issued,
at a specified
time and
place,
why
he has
not done
so; and
that
he then
and there
return
the
writ
with his
certificate
of having
done
as he
is commanded.
The
peremptory
writ
must
be
in a
similar
form,
except
that the
words
requiring
the
defendant
to
b
show
cause
why he
has
not done
as
commanded,
must be
omhitted.
§ 719. When
the
right to
require
the
performance
of 
the act
is clear,
and
it is apparent
that
no valid
excuse
can
be giv-
en for
not performing
it,
a peremptory
mandamus
may
be allowed
in
the first
instance;
in
all other
cases,
the
alternative
writ
must
be
first
issued. 
§ 11. The
motion
for
the
writ
must
be
made
upon 
affidavit;
and
the court
may require
a
notice
of the application
to
be given
to the adverse
party,
or may
grant
an order
to show
cause
why it
should
not be
allowed,
or may
grant
the writ
with-
out
notice.
§ 11. The
allowance
of
the
writ must
be
indorsed
thereon,
signed
by
the
judge
of
the
court
granting
it,
and
the
writ
must be
served
personally
upon the
defendant;
if the
defendant,
duly served,
neglect
to return
the same,
he shall be
proceeded
against
as for contempt.
§ 722. On the return day of the alternative
writ, or
such further
day as the
court may
allow, the party
on whom
the
writ shall
have been
served may show
cause, by
answer made
in
the same
manner
as an answer
to
a petition
in a civil action.
§ 11. If
no
answer
be
made,
a
peremptory
mandamus.
must be
allowed against
the defendant;
if answer be made,
con-
taining new matter, the
same shall not, in any respect,
conclude
the plaintiff, who may,
on the trial or other
proceeding, avail
himself
of any valid objections
to its sufficiency, or may
conter-
vail it by proof,
either
in direct denial
or by way
of avoidance.
§ 11. No
other
pleading
or
written
allegation
is:
allowed
than the writ
and answer;
these are
the pleadings
in the
case, and
have the
same effect,
and are to
be construed
and may
be
amended in
the same manner,
as pleadings
in a civil
action;.
and the
issues thereby
joined must
be tried, and
the further pro-ceedings

thereon

had,

in the same
manner
as in a civil
action.
§ 11. If
judgment
be
given
for
the
plaintiff,
he
shalt
recover
the damages
which
he shall
have sustained,

be ascertained

by

the court
or jury, or by
referees,as

recovery
of
damages,

virtue
of
this
arti-
cle,

who shall
have made
a return to a
writ of
mandamus, is a bar to any
other action against the
same party
for the making of such return.
§ 11. Whenever
a peremptory
snandamus
is
directed
to any public
officer, body
or board, commanding
the
performance
of any public
duty specially
enjoined
by law, if it
appear to the
court that

or any member
of such body
or board,

so
enjoined,
the
court

dollars, upon
every
such officer
or member
of

or board.
Such fine,
when
collected,

paid into
the treasury
of
the-
county
where
the
duty ought
to
have

performed;
and
thepayment

thereof

penalty incurred
by-
such
officer
or
member
of such
body
or board,
by
reason
of
his
refusal
or neglect
to
perform
the duty
so
enjoined.

ance
until

which
may be recovered
from
the garnishee,
shall be

or its
proceeds, shall

attached
property
which may
have passed
out
of his hands
without
having
been
sold or converted
into money;

executed
on
the
same property, or the same persons are made garnishees, the

sureties,

county, to be approved

the plaintiff's
claim,

the defendent
shall perform
the judgment
of the
justice, the
attachment

in

such
action shall
be discharged,
and restitution
made of any
property taken under it,

liability
of
a garnishee,

defendent
shall, before
the
trial is commenced,

file

ment in the plaintiff's
affidavit, the justice

case
where

order
of
attachment
has
been
issued
by
a justice
of
the
peace,

shall
appear
from
the
re-
turn of the officer
and from the examination
of the garnishee,

has

been taken under the attachment,
but that the defendant
is the owner of an interest in real estate in the county, the justice

before whom
such action is pending
shall, at the request of
the plaintiff, forthwith
certify his proceedings
to the district
court of the proper county;
and thereupon the clerk
of said court

the
time
of
or

reason to
believe, and does
believe, that any person
or corporation to be
named, and
within the county where the action is brought, has
property, money,
goods, chattels, credits and effects in his hands,
or under his contract, belonging to the defendant, or that such
person
or
corporation
is
anywise
indebted
to
the
principal
defendant,

whether

such indebtedness
be due or not, that the principal
defendant (naming him) is justly indebted to the plaintiff in a
given amount over and above all legal setoff, and that the plaintiff
has good reason to and does believe that he will lose the same
unless a garnishee
summons issue to the
aforesaid person, a gar-
nishee
summons
shall be issued
and personally
served,
in the
sane
manner as an
ordinary summons,

property, money and articles in his hands or due from him to the
defendant.

suit

before said justice, on a
day named, not more than
twenty days
from

§ 11. Upon
such
affidavit
and
undertaking
being
ex-
(ecuted and
filed
with
the
justice,
he shal
issue
a
summons
as
in
other
cases,
but

addition
commanding

imred-
iately
to
seize
and
take

his custody,
wherever
they
may
be
found
in the

mnentioned

affidavit,
and
deliver
the
same
to the

§ 63. The

writ
by
taking
the
property
therein
mentioned.
He
shall
also
deliver
a
copy
of
the

to the
persons
charged
with the
unlawful
detention
of property,
or

a
copy at

time
and

of
service,
and

undertaking
taken
by

§ 64. If,
within
twenty-four
hours
after
service
of
the 
copy
of
the
summons,
there
is executed,
by
one or
more
sufficient
sureties
of
the
defendant,
to
be
approved
by
the
constable,
an
undertaking
to
the
plaintiff,
in
not
less
than
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property,
as stated
in
the
affidavit
of
the plaintiff,
to the
effect
that
the
defendant
will
deliver
the
property
to the

if such
delivery
be adjudged,

is given
by

defendant,
give
notice
to
the
constable
that
he
excepts

to

the
sufficiency
of
the
sureties.

do
so,

must
be deemed
to
have
waived
all
objections
to
them.
When
the
plaintiff
excepts,
the
sureties
must
justify,
upon
notice,
as
bail
on
arrest.
The
constable
shall
be
responsible
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
sureties
until
the
objection
to
them
is
waived,
as
above
provided,
or
until
they
justify.
§ 11. The affidavit
of the plaintiff, as to the value
of
the
property,
shall

the
jurisdiction
of
the
justice
so
far

such 
value
is concerned;
but
the
value
of
the
property
shall
not
be
assessed
against
the
defendant
at
a greater
amount

that
sworn
to
by

plaintiff
in

affidavit.

right
of possession
of
the
defendant
to the
property
taken.
If
the
jury
shall
be
satisfied
that
the
said
property
was
the
property
of
the
defendant
at the
commencement
of the
action,
or if
the said
jury
be satisfied
that
the defendant
was
entitled
to
the possession
at
such
time
they
shall
find
accordingly,
and
shall
furtier
find
the
value
of such
property,
or the
value
of the possession
thereof,
and
any
damages
for
witnholding
the same
as may
be
just
and
proper.
§ 11. In
all
cases
when
the
property
has
been
deliv-
ered
to the
plaintiff,
when
the jury
shall
find
for
the
defendant,

shall
also
find
whether
the
defendant
had
the
right
of
property,

or

the
right
of possession
only,
at
the
commencement
of the
suit,
and,
if
they
find either
in his
favor,
they
shall
also
find
the
value
of
the property,
or the
value
of the
possession,
and such
damages
for withholding
said property
as
may
be just
and
proper.

case mentioned
in
the two

value
of possession
of the
same,

cannot
be
had, and
for
damages
for
withholding
said
prop-
erty,
and
the

§ 11. In
all
cases
when
the
property
has
been
deliv- 
ered
to the plaintiff,
where
the jury
shall find
for the
plaintiff on
the trial, or on inquiry of damages, they shall assess adequate
damages
to the plaintiff for the illegal
detention of the property,
for which, with costs of suit, the justice shall render judgment
against the defendant.
§ 11. When the property
claimed has
not been taken,
the action may

break
Open

§ 11. Whenever
it shall
be
made
to
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of the justice,
by the affidavit
of the plaintiff,
or other-
wise,

disclose
where such property is, or deliver the same to the officer.
§ 11. If
any
justice
shall
issue
a
