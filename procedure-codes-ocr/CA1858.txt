into court, and take from the clerk receiving the same, two certificates

of such payment ; the one of which he shall deliver or transmit to the

require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place
before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, to answer concerning the same ; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the
application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided upon the return of an execution.
Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor,
the judge may, upon aflidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or
attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the debtor and bring him before
such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be ordered
to enter into an undertaking with suflicient surety, that he will attend
from time to time before the judge or referee, as shall be directed,

any ofiicer or member thereof, to appear at a specified time and place,
before him or a referee appointed by him, and answer concerning the
same.

the order shall not be so applied, when it shall be made to appear by the
debtor’s aiiidavit, or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for

the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.


§ 244. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest
in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, the court or_ judge
may authorise, by an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor
to institute an action against such person or corporation, for the recovery of such interest or debt ; and the court or judge may, by an order,
forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt, until an
action can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment. Such order
may be modified or vacated by the judge granting the same, or the
court in which the action is brought, at any time, upon such terms as
may be just.

§ 245. If any person, party or witness, disobey an order of the referee, properly made in the proceedings before him under this chapter,

a contempt.

§ 247. If there be surplus money remaining after payment of the
amount due on the mortgage, lien or incumbrance, with costs, the
court may cause the same to be paid to the person entitled to it, and
in the meantime may direct it to be deposited in court.

§ 248. If the debt for which the mortgage, lien or incumbrance is
held, be not all due, so soon as suiiicient of the property has been sold
to pay the amount due, with costs, the sale shall cease; and afterwards, as often as more becomes due, for principal or interest, the
court may, on motion, order more to be sold. But if the property
cannot be sold in portions, without injury to the parties, the whole may
be ordered to be sold in the first instance, and the entire debt and
costs paid, there being a rebate of interest where such rebate is

proper.

3d. When it is objected at the trial, and appears by the evidence,
that the action is brought in the wrong county, or township, or city;
but if the objection be taken and overruled, it shall be cause only of
reversal on appeal, and shall not otherwise invalidate the judgment ; if
not taken at the trial, it shall be deemed waived, and shall not be
cause of reversal.

§ 592. When the defendant fails to appear and answer, judgment
shall be given for the plaintid, as follows:

1st. When a copy of the account, note, bill, or other obligation upon
which the action is brought, was filed with the justice at the time the

for the sum specified in the summons;

2d. In other cases the justice shall bear the evidence of the plaintill‘, and render judgment for such sum only as shall appear by the evidence to be just; but in no case exceeding the amount specified in the

§ 593. Upon issue joined, if a jury trial be not demanded, the justice shall hear the evidence, and decide all questions of fact and of
law, and render judgment accordingly.

§ 594. Upon a verdict, the justice shall immediately render judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the justice, judgment shall be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if the

to allow judgment‘ to be taken against him for a specified sum, the
plaintiff may immediately have judgment therefor, with the costs then

to recover in the action a sum equal to the offer, he shall not ‘recover
costs, but costs shall be adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted from his recovery. But the offer and failure to accept it shall

shall create any lien upon any lands of the defendant, unless a transcript of such judgment, "certified by the justice, shall be filed and recorded in the ollice of the recorder. When such transcript is to be
filed in any other county than that in which the justice resides, such
transcript shall be accompanied with the certificate of the county clerk

It shall intelligibly refer to the judgment by stating the names of the
parties, and the name of the justice before whom, and of the county,
and the township or city where, and at the time when, it was rendered; the amount of judgment, if it be for money; and if less than the
Whole is due, the true amount due thereon. It shall contain, in like
cases, similar directions to the sheriif or constable as are required by
the provisions of Title VII, of this act, in an execution to the sheriff.

§ 602. The sheriff or constable to whom the execution is
directed, shall proceed to execute the same in the same manner as the
sheriif is required by the provisions of Title VII, of this act, to proceed upon executions directed to him; and the constable, when the
execution is directed to him, shall be vested for that purpose with all
the powers of the sheri&' ; and after issuing an execution, and either
before or after its return, (if the same be returned unsatisiied either
in whole or in part,) the judgment creditor shall be entitled to an order from the justice, requiring the judgment debtor to attend at a time
to be designated in the order, and answer concerning his property before such justice, and the attendance of such debtor may be enforced
by the justice. On his attendance, such debtor may be examined
under oath concerning his property; and any person alleged to have
in his hands property, moneys, effects or credits of the judgment debtor,

may also be required to attend and be examined, and the justice may

‘ order any property in the hands of the, judgment debtor, or any other

and presence of the justice, a warrant of arrest may be issued by such
